<review>This store is the worst experience i have ever had. I order something online through the store, that I suppose to pick up at the store. I never received my order there is a mistake that’s what I was told. Today is my third time coming to the store for my refund, between customer service and them not receiving an email to confirm my refund I being back and forward. Today while talking to Deion one of the manager he call security. For no reason I never used a bad word and never yelled at him, yes I raised my voice a little because he did not let me explain what was going and keep saying there is nothing I can do. I have to wait 45 min outside for the other manager Miranda who would had email them on my behalf to see if she got better luck than me.I’ll will never ever in my life visit this store. Playing with my time and my family time for mistake that they make.</review><Rating>1< /Rating></record>

I like this one more than south coast location mainly because of the store arrangement.   This one has women's downstairs with men's and kids upstairs, each feels like their own department.  There's an escalator and an elevator towards the back left side of the store.  Registers at all departments but the main one is at the lower level.   When they're short staffed or not busy, you would need to be rung up downstairs if you're shopping men or kids. Hand sanitizer located at the entrance, and they have plexiglass deviders at the registers.  They also have announcement through their speakers to recommend wearing masks and I do no recall seeing a signs to require masks.  I could be wrong though...</Text>

Very organized during COVID and includes sanitation station at the front. Same great styles and friendly service. Adjusted times of operation  tho but feel safe inside the store with not many customers and someone to take count at the door.< /Text>

This Zara is a 2 story department store. The bottom floor is all women and girls while the top floor is split between Men and Kids. The kids section is divided between boys and girls with sizes starting at 3m.

The store is clean and well organized.  Staff are friendly and helpful. Lines can be long upstairs as there is usually just 1 cashier.

The clothing selection is trendy/modern.  They do a great job keeping up with seasonal wear.

Prices:
$ cheap
$$  moderate
$$$ moderately expensive
$$$$ expensive
$$$$$ luxury

Zara rates: $$-$$$<//Text>

<rating>4</rating><Review>I absolutely love Zara stores. I used to work in one back in the days when I lived in Russia. I am so excited that Zara opened so close to my house! I will give this store 4 stars, because their selection of women’s clothes seems limited. It maybe because of the size of the store, I am not sure, but other locations like Cerritos have more options.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

This Zara is constantly out of  inventory for kids clothing. Also one of the few Zara's I know that will not sell clothing that is on the mannequin, even of it is the last outfit/size in stock. The staff here is also not as friendly as the the Santa Anita, Glendale and south Coast Plaza stores.<//Review>

<Time>1573074473007< /Time><Text>Zara claims to have exceptional customer service, which I am here to say otherwise. I have 3 orders placed and have them to be picked up at the store. I received notifications of each individual orders arrived at the store in Victoria Garden, Rancho Cucamonga CA on 3 different days (10/15, 10/15, 10/21). I came in to the store myself on 10/22 and showed an associate all 3 emails confirmations. She came back, handed me just 1 box, and stated that my other 2 weren’t there. She did not validate my ID. As she was walking away, I also realized that package she gave me was not mine, I immediately gave it right back and asked for a manager to look for my packages.

He repeated what the associate had said that my packages have not arrived at the store and shirked the problem off to customer service line. I called customer service and filed 3 claims on that day 10/22 and they promised me they will find my orders and that the 3 orders were definitely at the store. She said some one at the store will reach out to me shortly.

10/23, my Zara app showed all 3 of my orders have been “delivered” on 10/21. To my horror, I called customer service back that this information have been falsified by the store. I DID NOT come to the store on 10/21. I requested that if they have lost my packages or delivered them to the wrong person (most likely since no ID was checked on my end), I need a full refund on all 3 of my orders. Falsifying delivery status is unethical at the store level. Again, Zara customer service said they will investigate and follow up in 24-72 hours.

Today, 10/29, since no one has followed up with me from Zara, I decided to call Zara to see what the status is. The claim is still pending per customer service. I asked to speak to someone who is in charge of this process and the person told me out right “they are not available at the moment” and offer me another 24-72 hours call back. He also disclosed that every time I called , my case gets pushed back to the bottom of the inquiry. Again, I have no answer about my refunds or what is the status of the investigation at the store level. And instead of making it urgent, my case lost priority because of their lack of follow-up.

My 3 orders together total to $522 and change. For convenience and straight forward purposes I have them delivered at the store. It turns out, it became a scam. Neither store associates or Zara customer services have any clue on how not just 1, but 3 packages all went missing. The most disturbing part is the store falsified delivery status of all 3 on the day I did not present in the store (do please check your store camera).

Zara claimed to have a scanning process in place and assure that 3 of my orders were scanned in at the store. Then it is clearly there is a problem with packages handling and honesty issue at Victoria Garden, Rancho Cucamonga CA branch.

Since I have not received any of my orders, I requested my refunds. Zara customer service has not been helpful and I find myself chasing for my packages and now my refunds without any direct answer.

I clearly see now that if I let Zara take care of this matter, they possibly will follow up in a few days saying exactly what the store has falsified that I have received my order when in fact I DID NOT.

I write this to demand a follow up on investigation and full refunds on 3 of my orders. Also, I need everyone to be aware of what horrifying customer service Zara provide and there is no protection to the customer against the unethical business at the store level.

11/05/2019 Zara finally called and basically “apologized” about bad practice at the store . However, they REFUSED TO REFUND ME because the packages were picked up. Zara basically said:
“sorry ... we messed up giving your orders to someone else ... that person signed for it... and now you gotta pay for it... sorry again for our bad practice”.

<text>I know this place has a lot of bad reviews so far in regards to customer service, but it is still a relatively new location so I think a majority of the employees aren't seasoned yet. However that being said, they could spare to be more cheerful and polite to the customers. Hopefully this improves soon.</text>< Rating>

Believe the bad reviews about terrible customer service.  Bought a $75 green button up blouse at the Victoria Gardens location and wore it once. Washed in cold water per the instructions and hung to dry. The top shrunk to half its size and now I’m stuck with it. Contacted online customer service and was told the item needed to be taken back to the store for return. Went to the store and was directed to call customer service. Bottom line, I got the run around and no refund for their defective product. Last time at Zara for me.<//Review>

<time>1551864418342</time><rating>1</rating><review>3.6 stars in general for this gorgeous store is alarming. I would like to take the time to write this review and actually request corporate office to contact me via message. I wanted to express my experience with the manager on Monday February 25th 2019 on shift Miranda. By the look of the rest of the reviews its seems like they have changed a few managers around. It can be depending on the shift since its a retail store. The store is beautiful and is in a perfect location for the IE. However how can such a great store have such poor talent working here? Its a customer service issue clearly and it will reflect on sales for this location. My experience consisted of bad looks poor attitude and the own manager. Nobody was smiling nobody was greeting. In addition I went in to do an exchange and Miranda the manager yelled out to me and my fiancé the line starts over here on the right side of the register. When we had originally went in to ask for the exchange it started in the middle. Surely after we waited in line other people kept lining up in the middle. She seen the line built up and didn't say anything to make anyone move to the right side. I thought it was weird she was so rude to me and my fiancé. It was like she was in a bad mood or I we bothered her. I wrote this review to express how people feel and how experiences matter. Why not hire a manager or employees that like to smile and greet and help. Plenty of people out here enjoy retail and have a passion for helping others. lets find good talent for this Rancho location. I love Zara this store deserves it!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<text>Worst customer service.  I've been to almost all Zara's in the LA area, and have never had this type of exprience.  I was ignored at the register line for over 15 min while the employees were talking.  They probably noticed I had a return, as soon as another customer walked up with a purchase they offered to help. I did let the cashier know i've been waiting. When she called me up (in a bad manner) she acted as if she was doing me a favor and not her job.  No acknowledgement nor apology for skipping me.  SMH.< /text>< Pictures>

They towed my daughters car yesterday.  Lee was there within 15 minutes of me calling! I've never seen a faster response in my life! He was totally professional and friendly . He hooked up and hauled very quickly and carefully.  The whole thing took less than an hour! I'll never call another tow company again! They have my business forever!</Text>

<username>Tara Hope<//username><Text>Lee was very courteous, thorough  and prompt. My car would not start and I was stranded in the parking lot of a gas station. I had called for a tow after trying to jump the battery unsuccessfully. Lee arrived quickly and wanted to try and jump the battery himself.  I was so thankful he did. He was able to get my battery started and I did not need a tow.

I am very grateful for Lee's service that he provided me tonight. I locked my keys in my car along with all of my other belongings and Lee was there to help in no time. I appreciate the work he did as it was raining and cold outside but he still put on a happy face and helped me out. Best and fastest help I've gotten in a long time!! I appreciate the time so much<//review>

We had a man named Jason come help us move our classic 1958 Ford Fairlane and he handled it with so much care. We really appreciate his help and kind demeanor. It seems to be difficult to get good customer service anywhere in this town but from start to finish this company has been great! Thank you so much Premier Towing and Jason was awesome! Beautiful truck you guys have, too!<//Text>

I am very pleased with the service I received today.  Jason came out to pick my car up.  He was very friendly.  He was extremely careful when he loaded and unloaded my car.  He was very welcomeing and professional.  The tow truck was very clean and nice.  Thanks so much Premier Towing, especially Jason for a job well done...<//review>

Truck showed up when I was told it would, which was a lot quicker than I thought before I called. Jason, the driver, was courteous and professional. I hope not to need them again any time soon, but if I do, they are the tow company I would call.< /Text>

I bought a car regrettably put off the registration and lo and behold it was impounded not only that I was moving at the time and had all my work tools and all my musical instruments one of them being a guitar I just purchased for over $1,000 and considered to be my most valued material possession because of the benefit I get from playing it and how hard I worked to afford it. Anyway long story short I had a car impounded before it was a nightmare especially the way that the tow company treated me and my car because it was an impound and not a car being towed by the owner's request . went to the process to get the car back and not having a registration created problems in the process that add a days and cost to the whole scenario meanwhile the whole time I'm sitting here worried about all my instruments being in a hot car getting warped and ruined as well growing cost of having store the car for the extra days it took me to go through all the Hoops to register it to myself I was to the point where I figured I wouldn't be able to afford to get the car out and I probably would be heartbroken when I saw the condition of the instruments giving my prior experiences with other tow yards. When I finally got everything straightened out as far as paperwork I showed up at their tow yard expecting the worst but I'll tell you what I was overwhelmed when I was escorted to my vehicle which  the very thoughtful and kind driver had parked indoors in their own garage. they treated me with respect and professionalism all my stuff was accounted for in perfect condition. And if that wasn't enough to make me want to give the man a hug, without me having to ask Premier also aired up a tire that had gone flat and gave me a jump-start cuz the battery was drained. I can honestly say Premier Towing is by far is the most Superior tow company I've ever done business with the professional and they handle your property as if it was their own if not better. They're honest reasonable on price and flat-out good people. I can't praise them enough and from here on out will never call any other company when it comes to tow service I recommend them highly. I give them the highest rating I've ever given any company or business on Google. Thank you very much Premier Towing. You guys are awesome.< /Text>

It's pretty bad when a business treats remote customers secondarily because they know their service is the only one readily available in that area so loosing customers isn't a real problem. 2 hour wait on a 45 minute ETA is disgusting, especially with no updates through call or text lik your service offers. There's a major problem when the dispatch is telling the customer that the GPS is locating the driver to be in the neighborhood but no tow truck! Enjoy the one star outlier on your rating.< /review>

I couldn't be more grateful that God sent Rob from Premier Towing to my rescue. He went above and beyond to help me.  My husband was out of town and I had to handle the broke down work truck and trailer. He made sure I was safe and even gave me tips on how to drive the trailer back to my house. I will never forget that. Thank you Rob. You were a blessing.</Text>

Professionalism, Curtiousness, and Assurance, that's what I looked for, and that's exactly what I found!</review>< Date>

<text>had a flat tire on i5 outside of anderson.  was stuck for about 2 hours.  i had ordered roadside service through urgent.ly who ended up arguing with Rob the tow truck driver from Premier about my location.  Rob had been right and was unable to fulfill the order i placed through urgent.ly who declined to inform me that Premier would not be coming.  long story short, after i called Rob to find out what was going on, he went out of his way after a call to come find me, pick me and my disabled car up, and take me to the nearest tire center.  i also have medical issues and he graciously stopped to help me with those as well, in addition to giving me advice on how to keep the costs down in my current situation.  i just moved to the area and am thankful that Premier employs guys like Rob, otherwise the rest of my evening would have been a lot worse.  won’t be giving anyone else my business during my time here.  thanks again!< /text><Name>Garret Eustace<//Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

I broke down in my work truck earlier, and called my Roadside assistance,  but the tow truck was almost 2 hours out so I called budget because they were less than a mile away.  They were 2 hours out too, and the receptionist was a little rude. My boss told me to call premier,  and Rob showed until in less than 15 minutes.  I couldn't believe it. The service was great and it was even a few dollars cheaper.</text>

Terrible service. Tow truck driver with a flatbed continuously berates and harassed me after I told him 3 times I was feelings harassed and his response was “How do you think I feel? I just want to dump you on the side of the road” because he was “only making 40 bucks” well guess what buddy you chose to be a tow truck driver in Anderson California LOL!! Be upset at your life not customers!! Called the owner and left messages but no response, they must do this to customers all the time the way he had his little energy of courage. Garbage business.< /text>

Premier Towing is awesome!  I had a tragedy I lost my friend in a car accident.  Not only were the staff very kind and understanding but when my tow club lied to me (Good Sams) and continually putting me on hold/ dropping my calls.  Premier couldn't believe the poor customer service they jumped in and really helped me out.  They not only didn't charge me for an extra days storage fee they towed it 25 minutes out of town free of charge.  I love you guys thanks for jumping in there and making a bad situation better.

My fiance's was in an accident, her mom was driving, they towed the car to their lot and wanted to keep it there without telling her the price per night.  They just kept saying "don't worry about it, insurance will pay"  Insurance said they would pay for the tow, but the storage was "unnecessary"  She had the car there for 1 day, and to junk it was almost $400. The car was worth about $1000. These guys act like they're the authorities, they push around they're customers and try to extort insurance companies.< /Review>

Carla expertly sculpted my challenging hair and the result was--truly--THE BEST HAIRCUT I’VE EVER HAD.  I have extremely straight, fine, and thick hair--very hard to layer into the bowl cuts and pixies that I love.  Without the money to spend at a high end salon, I’ve just come to accept a level of choppiness.  Well no more!  I thought the haircut was great halfway through, but she made it perfect--even staying at it past closing.  I also appreciated that she explained to me why she was using certain techniques based on my hair type and desired style.  She is an artist that takes pride in her craft.  She is a warm, funny, and multifaceted person and I had a lot of fun talking to her, too.  I love that she promotes her fine art and hair styling together.  She even sent me home with some complimentary bulbs from her other business--a plant nursery.  She’s amazing!  Can’t recommend stopping by Cali Barber enough.< /review>

Very professional, provides a cultural experience that is generated from life long knowledge and study of hair and her unique life style which was cultivated from her growing up in Colombia.  Also she is a very accomplished artist!<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I've been to Cali Barber Shop and Art three times over the last few months and, plain and simple, have never gotten better haircuts anywhere else. The owner (who is the hair stylist) is extremely personable and fun to talk to, and the studio is beautifully decorated with original paintings that she made herself. She apparently used to cut hair for very high profile clients and this shows when you see the quality of the work she does. Anytime I'm around Santa Cruz I'll be stopping in for a cut here and can't recommend it enough!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I had to go in to cut off all the hair I've been growing over the last 7 years for a new job and without hesitating - she put me in the chair and knew exactly what would work for my hair.

<username>Gennyvie</username><Review>I was so happy to find out Santa Clara County was reopening and moving to phase 3, but only to find out that Santa Clara County isn't allowed to reopen due to the surge in positive COVID testing.

What do you do? Drive to Santa Cruz because barbers are open! We got here around 30 mins to close. Upon arriving we notice the door was closed and locked, but Karla warmly greeted us at the door.

Karla is a sweetheart and truly a kind individual. She isn't your normal barber, she loves getting to know her customers on a personal level and unlike other barbers she is a genuine person who doesn't sugarcoat things.

She gave us great tips on good local eateries.

If you are looking for a place to get a haircut, this is certainly a place to go. Thank you Karla.<//Review>< Pics>

I came to this place expecting just to get a haircut, and I left with something more valuable. Karla, the owner, is passionate about her work and her clients, and she genuinely cares about everyone she meets. I had 4 people in line before me, and all of them were happy with their haircut. When she finally got to me, she had no problem staying past closing time to perfect my haircut. After she was finished, I offered to give her a tip, and she declined because I mentioned I was looking for a job. She then made sure I ate that day, and sent me out the door with some cookies and fruit. The haircut came out perfect, and the experience was even better. Thank you, Karla.<//Review>

Great place to get a cut in Santa Cruz! AMAZING woman behind the chair who is funny, artistic, caring, and a true character☺️ I normally go to Montgomerys, but after this experience I'm definitely going back here, not just because of the quality but also the person. This place has a great vibe with the owner's art on the walls and an all around welcoming feel.< /Text>

Carla is a wonderful person as well as stylist! She won’t ever let you leave until your cut is presentable by her very high standards. I would call her a perfectionist, but that is an understatement!! She always makes you feel warm and welcome and is great company to have for any service you desire. She also does fantastic straight razor shaves that leave your face feeling baby smooth! If you haven’t gone here and you’re still going to Supercuts or some other cheap and quick place, you’re messing up! Her prices are also unbeatable, for the service you will receive!< /Review>

Most thorough and thoughtful haircut I've ever had.

True professional that knows how to manipulate your hair in order to have you looking you're absolute best!

I have lived aboard for years as well as in numerous US states and this is by far my favorite barber shop.

You will not be disappointed!< /Review>

As an African American/Filipino person, the haircut I received was great, I got a fade. Karla said she’ll do her best and I was surprised by the result especially because my type of hair is kind of rare for her to cut. Very great hospitality as well. I was given tea and a cookie to ease my stress a bit. Definitely would recommend this place and try giving it a shot.< /text>

Cali Barber shop is the only barber place in Santa Cruz I to get a haircut. Period.

Getting a haircut is normally something people dread, but not here. Every single time I go in for a haircut is a delightful, fun, and wonderful experience.

Between the art, the engaging conversation she provides and the many extra steps she takes to assure that your hair (and Beard!) looks perfect really shows. Don’t make a mistake, get your trim and cuts here!<//text>

Best haircut since i moved out here. Really comfortable atmosphere, had a very at home type of feel. Beautiful art work on the walls for sale, and Karla not only does really good haircuts but is really nice to talk to. Even gave me very helpful insight as to my plans for school. 10/10 would return there.</Text>

Always a good haircut. You may (like me) have to ask to get your clipper bits cut shorter but it's better to have to ask later than to regret having cut it too short at the outset.< /Text>

<review>Amazing hair cut! I was afraid of getting a haircut since I moved here but Karla paid a lot of attention to detail and took as much time as necessary to make it perfect.
And it was surprisingly cheap considering the prices I've seen at other places, it's really worth it!
You'll enjoy her paintings too, and might get a cup of tea if you're nice :)

Read some Google reviews, and it loved up exactly. A good balance of experience, but not just doing the same cut for everyone. And it's a great price. Will return for as long as I'm in Santa Cruz.< /Review>

I got a haircut from this place about three weeks ago but my hair still looks good even after it has grown out. My haircut experience was nice, I didn't feel rushed and I had a really great conversation to top it off. I will definitely be coming back for my next haircut!<//review>

< Review>
This place is probably the best place to cut your hair in Santa Cruz. I am very picky about how I cut my hair at times and after trying a large quantity of places this is where I keep going now. Karla is an incredibly nice and talented woman and with the right directions she can leave your hair exactly how you want it. She is also a lovely person and a genuine one as well. She has beautiful art hanging on the walls which are nice to look at. If you want your haircutting experience to extend to something that leaves you in a great mood, this is the place to go.< /Review>

Top 5 best haircuts of my life!  She's getting a bit busy now that the word is out and other shops have shut down, so expect a wait or make an appointment.  Awesome fade, great advice and conversation.  Will be back!</text>

In the end I had a GREAT haircut for a Great PRICE, and also had some really good conversation.

This is my fourth time coming to Cali barbershop and I have to say Karla is wonderful at what she does. She always knows how to do my hair and has a great sense to detail. She really makes you feel welcome and I always leave with a smile on my face because of how good she makes me feel. She has become my favorite hair stylist and I really recommend her to any one who is looking for a great service.</Text>

Guandia is my top pick when it comes to my boyfriends hair. Not only did she make us feel welcome she totally knew what she was doing and he walked out feeling better than he did before and he’s OCD as heck and hard to please. Not to mention her own hand painted art all over the shop brought a warm vibe to the setting. Personable, humble and professional. Thank you for the experience! Definitely more than just a hair cut.</review>

She was amazing and was extremely friendly. It is a cozy atmosphere and she doesn't try to rush through the haircut to get your money. She takes her time to make sure that you are getting the best cut possible.She gave me the exact haircut I had in mind and I will definitely return. I got my hair cut a couple weeks ago, but she left such an impact on me, I had to write her a review.<//Review>

Great haircut. I'm a guy with pretty difficult hair to cut, and I usually just want a trim of a couple inches, and she always impresses. Very high quality and the best haircuts I have had in years. Excellent service and very professional. Would recommend to anyone! -Tibor< /Review>

<Review>Karla cuts women's hair too! First time in, and I felt like Karla really listened to what I wanted and did an excellent job. I have short hair, and appreciate that Karla's prices are the same for women's and men's cuts, since a lot of places charge women more for no reason. The whole experience at Cali Barber Shop was great! Karla really wants you to be happy with your haircut, and is great to chat with in the process. Highly recommended.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This place is great.  Carlita is a wonderful barber who knows what she is doing and will tell you your opinion straight. Her Columbian accent is beautiful and strong but she is okay with being asked to clarify :)
This is not youur traditional barbershop - art on the walls and female barber - but dont let that stop you. She deserves all this review love.</review>

It was not just a good haircut, but I also had a really nice chat and the service was unique. I recommend this place 100%!Cheers from Austria :)< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I’ve been going to this barbershop my first year here in Santa Cruz and Carla is such an awesome and reliable barber, honestly. She takes her time on every haircut and I have never even had close to a bad haircut here. I definitely recommend her.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I was in town visiting from Australia looking for a quick haircut when I stumbled onto this gem. Easily the best hair cut i've ever had. She is very knowledgeable and is great at explaining what she's doing.  Plus it's inexpensive. Worth a shot if your local or foreign alike.

I don't know how people are giving this place a five star! I would give supper cuts 10 stars compared to this place. I have never been rushed out of a chair for the next customer. I came out of the chair with lines in my head the fade I got was terrible. I would never recommend this place to anyone. The prices were also way to high. The guys that fixed my hair cut after I left only charges $15.<//text>

<text>Excellent! Great! Best! Just moved from NY to Santa Cruz and was looking for a great place for a haircut. Following my Google search for best Barbershop in Santa Cruz I found "Cali Barbershop" to have the best reviews.  The place has three chairs well kept, clean and reasonable. I got a cut for 20$ and left 10$ tip because it was such a nice experience. My hair looks Great! I am very pleased! There is Art on the walls all by the owner who engaged me in a delightful conversation about her work and inspiration. This is exactly the place you want to have your haircut. 💈💈💈💈🏄🏄🏄🏄<//text><time>1442875453421< /time>< gmap_id>

Got a great haircut for a great price too! Not only did my hair look great, but my stylist taught me how to style and comb my hair in a few different ways that I didn't know before. Overall amazing experience!</Review>

<Review>When I went for my haircut 3 months ago, I must say that Karla did a wonderful job. I gave her instructions for what I now know is a fade haircut. Never had my hair cut in that fashion, but I found the end result attractive. Not bad at all. However, service is slightly overpriced and I was allergic to the biscottis, which I respectfully turned down. On the bright side, however, she is an excellent conversationalist. Might return in the future.</Review>< Response>

<user_name>Luis Berumen<//user_name><Resp>None</Resp><review>YOU need to GO here.

After a disappointing haircut from a salon, I decided to head over to this barber shop to get my hair "fixed." It was not until I sat on the chair with Carla that she was able to point out all the mistakes from the previous stylist. Carla is an artist, and her work proves it. She was able to fix me up and make me look great! I was beyond happy.

Best thing about her is that she is able to point out how your hair is (i.e. the way your flows and is fixated on your head.) Not everyone can get the exact haircut from those online photos, but Carla is able to transform your hair to a photo worthy style.

She works with you along the way to make the cut you want, at times her suggestions and how she explains the way your haircut could be better is refreshing compared to other barbers. She sees how your hair correlates with the formation of your face and she works around that.

You will NOT be disappointed  here. She is a sweet Colombian woman who is a pleasure to talk to. I am definitely returning here for all my future cuts! 5 out of 5 stars!

<Review>I highly recommend Cali Barber Shop!!! As soon as you walk in you are greated by Karla who is hands down the best barber I have ever been too!  I asked for a very technical haircut along with a shave and She delivered everything I asked for and then some. :) Not to mention her prices are the best in the United States... You get exactly what you want without breaking the bank and to top it off her customer service is the BEST! Cali Barber Shop has definitely earned a new client for life!!! I promise you wont be let down...

Thank you Karla.

Karla is about the sweetest old Colombian woman you'd ever care to meet.  This is the best haircut I've had except for one time in Japan.  I'm Air Force and I have to get my hair cut about every two weeks; I know haircuts.  If I lived around here, I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Period.  She's the best.  She offered me tea and cookies.  She was extremely proffessional and warm too.  Her place of business was small but very neat, clean, and orderly.  She taught me many little tricks to use to shape my hair.  She even trimmed up my facial hair and showed me tricks for that.  She takes her time and is very meticulous.  She was fretting about individual hairs!  I loved it.</text>

<Text>where to start... Karla is one of the nicest ladies i've ever met this barber shop will always be my favorite place. I am sad to read some bad reviews because Karla has been nothing less then amazing even on a bad day she is still able to put on a big smile and positive attitude. I've never had a barber pay so much detail to my hair and how i look. I have gone to other barbers and paid 50$ for a haircut yet Karla has still managed to let me leave feeling confident and better then any other haircut i have had. The attention to detail she shows on cutting hair also shows in her beautiful paintings!<//Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The lady who owns the shop is really good! She knows exactly what she's doing as I'm sure she's been cutting hair for many years. She could have made more money off of me by doing something that I didn't need, but instead she advised me to do otherwise. Saving me money and problems in the future. She was very helpful and very friendly. She even knows how to cut curly hair! For all those curly-haired people out there! And the prices are cheapest in town! I loved it, and you will too.< /Review>< Pictures>

I wasn't sure if this place would be the right place to get a women's haircut since this is a barber shop, but I'm glad I went anyway. Karla is super talented with cutting hair and I love the haircut she gave me! She was very detailed and knowledgeable about what kind of haircut that would suit me. The haircut was only $18 too! Way cheaper than the salons around here with a haircut just as good.<//text>

Karla is an absolute treasure, and one with a masterful grasp of how to cut hair. Checks all the boxes and then some; you’ll enjoy going there and having tea with her, your cut will be excellent, and the price you pay will be reasonable.</Review>

I was surprised at the last review given to Cali Barbershop.  I have had several haircuts and shaves at the shop. Every time has been excellent.  Carla has been professional and courteous.  My haircut was outstanding.  Carla gave suggestions about my hair, that made noticeable improvements.  My co-workers noticed and made positive comments about the new style.  I have tattoos and never once has there been any comments or statements about them.
I have had haircuts at more expensive shops that have not equaled the quality of my haircut received at Cali Barbershop.<//Review>

<Text>Went for a haircut, got two bananas, three lemons, a cup of tea, nice conversation and looked around Karla's artwork hanging around the shop. Oh and also got an amazing haircut for a reasonable price. And also got two biscottis. You won't regret going to this place.< /Text><rate>5<//rate></record>

Such a lovely time here, always. I've been going to see Karla for the past three months, and always leave with a "premier" haircut. Plus, she's teaching me Spanish! Can't go wrong, highly recommended.<//review>

This place is a life saver! She managed to turn a very shoddy cut I received from a random shop in San Jose into a very stylish and clean looking hairdo. I went from being afraid to show my hair in public to incredibly happy with my haircut in 20 minutes. Plus the barbor herself is personable and very friendly! I'll make sure to make this my regular shop from now on!</Review>

<Review>I walked into the place (absolutely tiny) and walked into a conversation about the Wright Brothers. Still not clear on how it came up, but it was interesting.

Anyway, great haircut, great conversation. I'm definitely going back when this cut grows out.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

A wonderful experience. I wanted a traditional straight razor shave, which is exactly what I got! I didn't even know that a shave could be this close.

In addition I had her trim my hair. Now it feels much healthier.
This was totally worth it!<//review>

If you really want to waste your time and your money this is the place. The stylist spend a hour just cutting around my head and ears. I show her a picture of the haircut that I want and she  didn't do what I ask her to do. When she was done I ask her if she could trim a bit more and she got mad at me. If you really call yourself a "barber" do what the customer ask for. This place doesn't have A/C or any fans to keep the place cool. The stylist is nice, but not experienced enough for what she charges. The haircut isn't worth the fee charged. Furthermore the fee listed for the haircut is listed as two dollars less.  I guess because I told her to cut more of my hair she decided  the price should be higher. The  haircut should have been  $24 but she charged me $26.  I didn't get the haircut that I ask for. I end up totally cover with my own hair from head to toe. The stylist didn't even bother to cover me with a drape after it fell off during the haircut.  The stylist even scratched  me four times!  Bottom line- terrible cut and overpriced. I will never go back again . 2 thumbs down 👎 👎</text><response>None</response>< Rating>

<Text>Lovely barbershop, decorated with art that the hairdresser did herself which just goes to show how well detailed and thorough her work is when it comes to cutting hair as well. It did not take long either. She knew the best way to cut my hair which was at time a wreck so I do recommend it, felt great after.<//Text>< gmapID>

I literally just paid 27$ for the worst haircut of my life. I asked for a taper with a 4 and all I got was a few inches of my hair cut and no taper whatsoever. Then she had the nerve to try and charge 15$ for a beard trim!!! Absolutely don't recommend this place to anyone, go look for a real barber shop. First and last time coming here. I feel robbed<//Text>

<text>Service was awesome! The owner is really nice and tentive to her customers. Had a haircut with no real idea of what style I wanted and came out about 40 minutes later with a pretty sweet haircut. Will visit again and highly recommend to others! Btw it is pricey so be weary of cost if income is low.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808e402facc42a9b:0x4d696379a9b88f36</gmapID></record>

Good for the first visit, but not repeats. She charged me more the second time, and she made a show of putting more work into the cut than she actually was. Also makes a habit of making unnecessary, offensive comments.< /review>

So clean and beautiful inside, especially the Art Studio 😜.  Stylishly cut, with a classic barber shop finish.  My 1st time, but Karla really understood my hair.  And my gf loves the fresh look!</review>

I normally don't feel compelled to write a review for something but Cali Barber Shop went above and beyond. My haircut was precisely what I wanted, the location is convenient (especially for UCSC students) and it's a free space to talk to people about almost anything.< /Review>

More often than when she was actually cutting my hair she would stop and try to sell me her artwork or talk about her life's troubles making for a very uncomfortable haircut. She also gives people a discount to make a review, hence the unnormal amount of reviews on this page. Would definitely not recommend.</Text>< response>

After a lifetime of getting my hair cut at supercuts and greatclips it is SO refreshing to get a haircut from someone who actually understands hair.  Not only did Karla give me an excellent haircut,  she also explained to me how she was using the characteristics of my hair (thickness, growth direction, etc.) to help decide how to cut it efficiently and effectively.

Will be returning for my next haircut and every haircut.< /Text>

I had been butchered by another "barber" and Carla saved the day before a wedding!!!

Carla makes lemonade and lemonade is tasty thanks be to God.

Ask her for her amazing trout recipe too!

She has art hanging up all over that is for sale and is very unique. I got a shave and and haircut it was a little pricy but worth every dollar. She offers hot chocolet for cold days and cucumber water with lemon for hot ones. This is a great place to relax and have a peaceful trim. She also plays the accordian and if you're lucky she'll play for you. I really enjoyed my time here and was not expecting my haircut to be so fun.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I gave Cali Barber Shop and Art 1 out of 5 stars and I was so excited to go there, I would give it 0 stars if I could because of this. I never really had a haircut from a barber and I though why not try it out. I went online and looked up best haircuts in Santa Cruz and I found Cali Barber Shop it had 77 reviews and 4.9/5 stars and some of the reviews said it was the best haircut they had in years. My brother, mom, grandma and I, went to get our haircuts. We went there and while we were waiting for our haircuts the barber asked our race and we said Iranian then she went on to say how Iran is a danger to America and how Iran is attacking Syria, she mistaked Iranians as Isis so you can tell shes not the brightest. We all left there was no way we were staying after that. We were gonna call the owner and report this barber so that the whole place isn't affected by 1 barber but when we called we found out that barber was the owner. More than mad at the owner I felt bad that some people are so uneducated about what is going on in the world.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808e402facc42a9b:0x4d696379a9b88f36</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Not happy with haircut fade wasn’t even faded rite, on top of that very expensive I had to pay $35 for a bad haircut now I have to go to another barber to try to fix this madness on top of that it’s xmas now I have to wear a hat to cover this monstrosity I had read nothing but good reviews about Carla but they were all lies save your money and hair go somewhere else very disappointed don’t know how this place has so many good reviews they must pay to have bad reviews removed but only keep some to not make suspicious< /text>

<Review>This barbershop isn't the flashiest or largest in town, but the owner and operator Karla is an absolute delight to receive a haircut from. She is very attentive and honest about hairstyles, and I love her paintings of the ocean and waves.

Karla is very compassionate and her prices are very fair, she gave me one of the closest shaves i've had, and pulled off a nice old school haircut. I highly recommend visiting Karla, I know i'll be back for more haircuts and complimentary biscotti!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

It's good for a nice clean cut. Downside is that it takes about an hour for a simple cut and is kind of pricy for a college student.< /Review>

I't is to bad that Yelp hiding all my reviews and not only that, when people try to find a barber shop in down town Santa Cruz or the closed one's they pass over my barber shop and show barber shops that are located out of the mileage that they are looking for.
Yelp only show up the good one's that paid them and the bad one's that don't paid too, to show people that they are doing a great job with the information wish is totally wrong. They tell people go to the filter but that word is fade off and you have to have very good eyes if you want to see the word. I want to say thanks to Google to be honest with all of us. That is why more and more people trust Google day by day. Thanks to all of you for your support. K.G.<//text><Date>1379801734322< /Date>< user_id>

My favorite barber in Santa Cruz. She just gives a very nice clean cut every time that looks good in any situations. Every cut is an experience.< /Text>

<Text>Got a chicken shawarma sandwich. Was pretty flavourless for the most part, basically not seasoned enough or maybe even at all. Typical pricing for Santa Cruz so can't fault them for that, just no flavor.

However the hot sauce was pretty good, the sandwich wasn't horribly greasly nor big mess, it was packaged pretty well with the ingredients mixed pretty well. Also the staff are pretty cool.

Their other items might be better.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Great Falafel sandwich. The Hummus and the mixture of fresh veggies and crunchy yet soft from the inside Falafel 🥙 is just yummy. To top it, the great aftertaste is just amazing.< /review>

I'm a Chicago Native and a foodie. This is the nearest place in The Monterey Peninsula to get a healthy meal. The Gyro is great. Their signature hot sauce is good. The staff has always been great. The owner 30 plus years there.  If anything to change is the cucumber sauce and add more cucumbers to the salad.
They got a awesome Ginger Beer.  Non alcoholic.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>The restaurant was the last thing I had expected. The staff is unprofessional, the food is cooked poorly, and is very expensive for what it is. The restaurant needs to be cleaned, I would let this slide if you are a Waffle House, but you are not. Waffle House gets a slide due to if it is clean the food must suck. One last thing they only take cash or check! This is commonplace in the some parts of the United States like Ohio and Pennsylvania but for the San Francisco area it is a surprise. But, they do have a ATM in the restaurant. I would say parking is tight, if there was parking. I will not be coming back again along with others I was with at the time.</review>< Pics>

Falafel of Santa Cruz has great tasting falafel, humus, and chicken schwarma. The prices are reasonable, and if you order ahead, the food will be ready for you when you get there.

As others have mentioned, the place isn't fancy, but the people are super-friendly and the food is terrific. We like to get the food to go, then head to the beach and eat in the car.< /review>

Falafel of Santa Cruz is a great restaurant. I repeatedly recommend it to my friends and family. It is a Santa Cruz staple. You won’t find better falafel anywhere else! The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, and the prices are reasonable. The special is a great deal. It comes with a sandwich, fries and a drink. You should try it if you haven’t.</review>

You will not find better falafel in Santa Cruz! That staff is all very friendly and helpful. Located right off mission st it’s a perfect quick bite and it’s even cheaper than the McDonald's across the street! In addition their babaganouj was some of the best I’ve tried. Highly recommend !<//Review>

This place is tasty. About 10 dollars for a tasty lunch of gyro, fries and a drink. Fresh, and the girls who constructed the gyro were meticulous. Great experience!

They were kind and asked me if I wanted hot sauce or extra tahini and I said yes to both. There are napkins available; apparently some people are mad in these reviews that they don't put them in the bag for you.</Review>

Great service, friendly staff, and AMAZING food! This is always a go-to for me when I'm in the area and it never disappoints. Their food it always fresh and delicious. The chicken shawarma special is one of my favorites, but you can never go wrong with their kabob plates. Also, the falafel burger is incredible when I'm looking for something vegetarian. Definitely recommend!</review>

<Text>Amazing family owned business, close to campus, reasonable prices, wonderful staff, fresh home-made foods with veg and vegan options. Falafel of Santa Cruz is Westside staple, and has been treating both staff and customers as family for years. PS!!! This business is in NO WAY affiliated with Falafel Hut downtown, which was just involved in some very controversial events.</Text><resp>None< /resp>< Rate>

<Text>While we waited 25 minutes for a sandwich and plate we watched the employees touching food without gloves after repeatedly touching their hair, face, and masks and never once wash theirhands... we finally got our to go order but when we got home and opened the order we found they forgot the pita bread that was supposed to come with the plate... unsanitary and a waste of time and money.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Overhyped whitewashed tasteless food. Nothing is authentic. No garlic to accompany any inkling of flavor, the tahin sauce is also tasteless and akin to ranch dressing. If you are arab find somewhere else. It cannot be called middle eastern food. Kid at the counter was pushing us for the 8 cents on our 45.08$ order. Give me a break.< /Review>

<text>Falafel of Santa Cruz is NOT the boardwalk business that was involved in the hate crime with a hot dog vendor. Falafel of Santa Cruz is located on Mission Street, has some of the best food and friendliest staff in Santa Cruz. Please do not listen to reviews that were meant for Falafel Hut, which is an entirely different business.</text><gmapID>0x808e41d55d007687:0x423cd866ec55dbe4<//gmapID>< resp>

Hands down one of my favorite meals in Santa Cruz. This place has amazing food, a great staff and it’s family owned and operated. Try the Falafel Burger and a side of the babaganoush...you won’t be disappointed.<//Review>

<Review>Falafel of Santa Cruz is the BEST falafel in town. The food is fresh, authentic, and delicious. The ultimate comfort food. I have been eating here for as long as I've lived in town (since 2011 ) and it's always a staple to take visiting friends and family to. I love supporting a local family owned business who treats their employees and customers alike as part of their extended family! PLEASE don't mistake this business with the falafel place near the boardwalk, which well meaning reviewers have mistakenly mixed this place up with and left bad reviews for... You cannot go wrong with Falafel of Santa Cruz!!<//Review>< Pictures>

Nothing good about this place...I usually do not post reviews so quickly unless it is really good or really bad. Unfortunately this restaurant falls in the second category.

Starting from the call i made to confirm the time to eating the food, everything is a 1 star, pathetic experience. The person who answered the call said that I can eat in if I am there by 9:30, I arrived at 9:25 but she said that they are taking only to go orders. As i didn't have other choice i decided to move forward. with the order.

I had to repeat myself multiple times as she could not hear me, I asked her to lower the music that was blasting in the back as if it was a night club.

Now coming to the main part, i would have let all the experience go if the good was good..I paid $22 and it is not worth it. There is smell in the lamb and chicken, and not to mention everything was salty. There were no napkins, plastic ware or hot sauce. I would get better service at a good cart where i can get similar but tasty food for half the price.

Sorry, but this is not your place please find something else.</Review>

<review>They were flexible in changing my order after I had already paid for it and let me slide when I was a little short under a dollar.  Quality service & food. Typical vibe I've come to expect in Santa Cruz. Looking forward to going back and paying it back forward tip-wise.</review>< Pictures>

The falafels are good but hey can't make a good tahini sauce to save their lives . They think you're supposed to put hummus in it (their vegan version) or yogurt (I'm stumped on where yogurt fits with tahini). So, unfortunately you'll have to be willing to forego a good tahini sauce or bring your own. Also be sure and taste the fries before you leave if you get their fries because nine times out of ten they're unsalted and then on that 10th time you forget to check they're over-salted.
If the owner reads this I'm going to say it again cuz I told him to his face, why are you putting yogurt in the sauce? You'll save frustration and money if you forego the yogurt. find yourself a good recipe for a tahini dip. It last longer than something mixed with a dairy product and will not be violating the vegan delicacy.  At the minimum please stop putting hummus in your vegan version. Just tahini butter, distilled water, lemon juice and a pinch of cayenne and you have a basic tahini.< /review>

Mediterranean food and the setting at this spot is very good. Great place to meet and catch up with friends. Looking forward to a return visit. Prices that won't break you. Wish it was closer to my house, I would come every week.</text>

The food and service was great. I bought a small falafel Sandwhich and for dinner for two: a chicken and gyro- the wrapping was a bit wet by the time I got home but I had t share my falafel with my senior cat who now is eating everything not for him!   Cole approves< /text>

Cash only! Not bad just good to know. We got there 30 min before they closed so it was to-go only. Not a big deal. I got the chicken shawarma, it was good tho I'm glad I got some extra sauce. I also got a vegetarian combo dish. It wasn't impressive.
I don't think we will be going back because I felt it was a little expensive for what I got. However, if I do go back it would be for the baklava.
I was going to give it 3 stars but gave it 2 seeing as the people who were preparing the food were not wearing gloves half the time, which is very important to me. Especially when one person seemed like they have a cold..<//Text>

The falafel here are delicious!
I did not give 5 stars because this place does not look ultra clean. Maybe the kitchen is clean, but the windows and dining room could use a deep clean. Just my own personal opinion.< /text>

The Falafel was fine- not the best I have ever ate but it was okay. The burger was dry. I would give the food 3 stars,but  the place, and especially the floor were very dirty and looked as if they has not been cleaned for months, the table was sticky. Not justifies the high rate.</Text>

Been going to this place for 32 years. Fairly Spartan I interior, but great food for a reasonable price. Falafels are actually spiced (you can taste the cumin!). Great yogurt sauce, decent pita and veg to accompany. Hummus plate comes not only with pita for dipping, but also pickled turnips. Yum! Burgers are also good, and the fries are great. Fountain drinks, bottled Snapple and the like. Quality consistent for a very long time.<//Review>

Came here looking for some halal food and this was the only place in the city that had it. The gyros and portions are really good. We got a gyro burger and a chicken gyro.

The burger gyro of course comes with a beef patty with gyro on top of it and my gosh it is something real fierce! The chicken gyro was scrumptious as well with the creamy yogurt sauce giving aid to the tender chicken. I really liked the food and would definitely come back here. Okay, that was a lie, I came here about three time already but it is really good.
Parking is hard to come by but I just park at Mcdonalds and cross over to eat here honestly. I knocked down one star because they only take cash and it is highly inconvenient to try and keep cash or use the ATM located inside their establishment to grab some cash. Amazing place none the less!<//Text>

Finally, I found great quality and great tasting falafel, and humus. Every place I have tried in Santa Cruz has been expensive, and terrible.

This place may not look like much, but the food is excellent, people are helpful and friendly.

If you are craving middle eastern food, you must stop and eat here. Hands down.< /Review>

The one thing about Santa Cruz, in general, is that there are tons of homeless people.  With that unfortunate scenario, you get lots of restaurants with "no public restroom" signs.  Even for patrons.  And I believe this was yet another restaurant with such a policy.  It's not a very inviting thing when you are a tourist in need of a place to eat and chill for a little while.  That is NOT a slight against Falafel, but more against the City of Santa Cruz and their apathy toward this growing problem.

Again, I would recommend Falafel and would go there again on another visit.  But I would take my food "to go" once again...</Text>< name>

The worst falafel ever.
They make the sauce with yogurt  instead of tahini, it's not edible and irrelevant to Falafel The falafel balls was frozen and not fresh maid.<//text>

<review>If this is the best falafel in Santa Cruz I'm very disappointed. The highest compliment I can pay it is it was not terrible. Though it was prepared correctly it was bland and devoid of flavor. Even adding the excellent hot sauce to the falafel didn't improve the blandness.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Value for money. Plenty of vegetarian options. Pita was soft & fluffy, hummus & babaganoush were creamy & flavorful. Falafel was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Spanakopitas, on the other hand, were extremely greasy; the filling was good. Baklava was average at best.
Friendly staff, self-service restaurant.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I have eaten falafel in cities across the country. This, by far, was the worst.

To start, the building itself, inside and out, is quite dirty.

The falafel was bland. That can be okay if the dressings are done well. Unfortunately, the vegetables were not ripe. Worst, the yogurt sauce just tasted like...yogurt. I could not detect anything added to it. No dill, for example. No salt, even worse.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

They're Falafels were dry and unappetizing and the sauces left more to be desired. Compared to counterparts such as Falafel House Downtown, they do not have much to offer.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Took 1hour to make the Worst tasting medatranian food I have ever head and way over priced not only that but my wife and I both got stomach cramps with the frozen meat and blisters inside mouth we where thete on Saturday afternoon got the all meat combo lamb and chicken skewer where completely frozen when put on the grill</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1531811732128, 'text': "Hello Shahryar,\n\nI am sorry for your bad experience. I checked with the staff that worked on Monday and they did not recall the encounter. The manager during the shift informed me that the day was very slow and no order took more than 5 minutes to make. Additionally, the meat that we serve comes off the vertical broilers (shawerma machines) and is hot and never frozen. The food that we serve is mainly MidEastern with falafels as the main seller. We are located at 1501 Mission street in Santa Cruz and there is a Mediterrenean restaurant next to us.  I don't have enough details of what you ordered  other than what you described. Our prices in addition for any sandwich average about $7.25 and from your assessment, the food was over-priced. Again, if your experience was at our establishment, we are sorry for the mishap and we will be glad to refund your order after you specify what items you ordered.\n\nBest,\nFalafel of Santa Cruz managment."}< /Response><GmapID>0x808e41d55d007687:0x423cd866ec55dbe4< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Very good falafels, and pretty cheap.  You get a large (6 falafel balls at least) sandwich, fries and a drink for something like $9.  The falafel had just the right crispiness and the taste was good.  Filling for the sandwich could have been a little better, but it was adequate....and the hot sauce was tasty and HOT!!!  Thick-cut fries that were yummy also.  Pretty much a hole-in-the-wall place, however, if you want a good, cheap falafel, this place will do!
Positives: Good, relatively fast and cheap.
Negative: Falafel "fixins" were pretty basic.</Text><Gmap_id>0x808e41d55d007687:0x423cd866ec55dbe4</Gmap_id>< time>

The best repair place I’ve ever been too! Professional, kind people, and fast! Customer service is great!, I can’t say a negative thing about the service. They truly cared about offering me the best quality service for my phone.<//review>

This seems like one of the smaller locations.

One employee was a little bossy handling the quarantine rules telling people to stand on the little circles. Even if they were right next to the circle. He wanted them exactly on them. Talk about power hungry.

But yet didn't offer any hand sanitizer for people using the debit card card machine? Did he really care about rona or did he just want to boss people around?

I'm greatly disturbed by these types of employees.<//text>

I'm giving this location a 5 because of Anthony taking the time to explain how to get the cheapest price possible when a case of a product. But tbis location is always friendly and clean. Also, well stocked with many keto friendly options.<//Review>

Cashier threw my fruits and Vegetables down the counter instead of being careful. I asked her to please be careful as I didn't want them to get bruised,   but she didn't listen and kept throwing them anyway. I just glared at her after. Grapes were not good. I will not go back. In the past the meat was not fresh and smelled bad. Too many problems at this particular Sprouts store!</text>

Some people may underestimate sprouts. But it is definitely your go to farmers market. They have a lot of selections of food, self care items, and etc. You should definitely download the app to get all the best deals.</Review>

I love this store. I decided to take control of my health with healthier food choices. What better way than to start with Sprouts, always full of fresh fruit and vegan style entrees, not to mention grass fed animals no antibiotics. Prices are very reasonable. I have weaned myself from traditional markets. Very pleased!!!</text>

U.S.A.  everyone decides on there own path.

No one has the right ....

If everyone listens to Governor Nuisance

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Upland Sprouts 7/1/20 AM
Concern with Sushi Bar:  Observed woman preparing sushi stop to answer her iPhone in her  pocket.  She stepped away to answer her ringing iPhone wearing gloves that she had on during the sushi preparation.  Once she was done with her iPhone she returned to the sushi bar and “did not change her now contaminated gloves.” She continued with handling of sushi, reached in the container of fresh ginger to distribute to the sushi containers she was prepping and continued packaging the sushi.  I was shocked and appalled to observe this breach and gross contamination with food handling.  I did report this finding to the Sprouts daytime manager,
Ron.  He said Sprouts does not oversee the sushi bar but he would notify the sushi company and report the concern.
**During Covid 19 this even more concerning with the spread of this virus.  A cell phone is a very contaminated surface.  I think food handlers should not be able to carry cell phones during work.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1594067560310, 'text': "Hi there, we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

Customer service is awful, Julia a cashier is horribly rude and abrasive. She doesn’t know how to speak to customers and is so no help. They should hire more friendly staff who come into work to help provide a friendly environment. will never shop here again<//Review>

CONSISTENTLY OVERCHARGED PLEASE READ

I go here sometimes when I’m visiting relatives, and purchase groceries for them on special occasions.  The past few weeks have been horrible experiences.

I don’t know if it’s just the store having high turnover and untrained employees, or if it’s some kind of joke, but they keep overcharging me. One time it was just apples and the difference was 20 cents so I figured “oh he just picked the wrong apple on the POS whatever”.

Then it was bread. 50 cents per loaf, okay I should probably get this checked out.

Next I was double charged for my whole entire shopping spree. I could tell because two receipts printed (which I thought was odd) but the guy only gave me one.

I called company after checking my bank statements, send them a whited out copy, and they replied it would take 6 months for a refund.

Luckily I got my money back right then and there at the store after telling the manager I won’t be shopping there again.< /Text>

<review>I just want to start by saying I have easily spent thousands of dollars at Sprouts in the last couple years and don't recall having ever returned an item. In fact on a couple occasions I have bought something that was expired and I just threw it out because it wasn't worth my time to return it. A little while back I purchased 2 face peels I happened to find in the clearance section (one of them had a clearance sticker and one did not, though they were the exact same product). When I finally opened one I discovered they were both completely dried out, the substance inside was completely hard. And the expiration date was still a year away so it was clearly defective, perhaps that's why it was on clearance.

So I took them in Friday night to exchange them and just put the small balance toward my usual large purchase. The cashier said it was no problem, she just needed to get her manager Melissa to override it. When she came she initiated the return, but then she noticed there was a clearance sticker on one and said she would not return them. Her actual words were "look at the sticker, we can't return that". She said that Sprout's policy was clearance items were final sale. When the cashier mentioned there was a sticker on only one, Melissa loudly snapped "that's because she ripped the sticker off the other one". I was speechless and humiliated she would accuse me of something so tacky. Why would I rip the sticker off one and not the other? And if she had bothered to look she would have seen there was never any sticker on the other box. You would not be able to cleanly remove a sticker off of that surface. Also, you can actually see that the barcode under the sticker is blacked out with marker, which it was not on the other box, so had a sticker been removed, there would have been the marking. So either she is completely unaware of her own stores markdown procedures, or felt it would be easier to blame the customer rather than admit perhaps her staff was not appropriately marking down all items (which I've encountered there countless times) and to try to improve on that.

I said I did not rip the sticker off and she ignored me. Humiliated I paid for my items and left. As I was paying I read the return policy at the counter, nowhere did it state clearance items are final sale. I thought when she told me to "look at the sticker" that perhaps it said final sale on the sticker. It did not. Also nowhere on my receipt does it state clearance items are final sale. And lastly, Sprout's own website states "Clearance and Manager's special items are returnable/refundable in accordance with our standard policy". So apparently Sprouts doesn't follow their own return policies, and they can also sell defective products to unwitting customers and the customer has no recourse. And most importantly their managers can freely treat customers with complete and utter disrespect. I worked in customer service for over a decade, I never try to take advantage of store policies and I'm always extremely respectful in all my interactions regardless of whether I am the employee or the customer. I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt this woman has no business working in customer service. She is either completely ignorant or completely defiant of her own company policies and procedures, and the judgmental and condescending manner in which she treats customers is inexcusable.

Sprouts has lost a loyal customer and I will share my experience with everyone I know. There are simply too many options available nearby, NOBODY deserves to be treated like that.< /review><time>1570513682431<//time><username>Ari S< /username><rate>1<//rate></record>

I love what Sprouts sells but I dread going to this location. Lines are always unreasonably long, very few checkout stands open, can we move incredibly slow. Frozen vegetables and fruits had freezer burn last two times I got them, and not a great selection compared to other sprouts stores.< /Text>

Ron, a cashier not sure if he's also a manager has horrible customer service. The minute he locked eyes on me it was obvious he wasn't going to be helpful to me. He over charged me $35 and when I walked up to him to ask how I can be helped he told me to get back in line. I jumped to another line and thank god for kat who was so helpful. She questioned ron several times to ask about my purchase, he rudely brushed her off, not wanting to make eye contact with either of us. And when she called him out for charging me twice he was really bothered. Not even offering an apology when I was standing right in front off him.< /Review>< pictures>

From the "mini" shopping carts, to the music that makes me walk to the beat, and of course the fresh produce, meats, fish, dairy, not to mention their great selection of breads, nuts, items to delight your sweet tooth, plus the enjoyable personnel, sturdy paper bags with handles, and no sticker shock at checkout, this is my "go to" shopping market!</Text>

Logan in the deli meat counter is the best! He will recommend different meats and let me sample them before I commit to getting a whole pound. He is very good at pairing the meats and cheeses most of the time I will let him choose for me and so far he's right on!!<//Review>

My wife and I pretty much live at Sprouts and it's not unusual for us to make several stops throughout the day. It doesn't offer everything we would want, but the majority of our weekly shopping is done here. The cashiers recognize us at this point and know us for our frequent stops to get food for our bunnies. Dairy tends to be more expensive, but produce is excellent and we enjoy the bulk section which allows us to stock up on popcorn, walnuts, raisins and occasionally raid the chocolate section.</Text>

This Sprouts fortunately is not up to par to other locations. I have gone to the deli numerous times during lunch. Mind you my time is limited. I place a sandwich order waited around for them to tell me  they are out of the chicken salad for the sandwich.  Really, how can you be out of chicken salad you're a market. One of two things is happening. 1 the Deli isn't being managed properly or 2 the delis understaffed time tp get it together. This has happened on four different occasions I definitely will not be returning< /Review>

<Review>Of everything I'm looking for in terms of food and health, this place usually has the most items of all other stores.

One issue that I had was bad blackberries that I always seem to be having to sort through. The produce dept. should be on top of this. It is their job, not mine.

-1 stars for this issue. It is the whole reason I shop here. For "HEALTHY" food. If i want unhealthy, rotten, or diseased food I could just go to the 99 cent store. At least they are alot cheaper.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

More variety in fresh fruits and vegetables. Everything else is kinda over priced.  But you do find more vegan options and can buy grains, nuts and dried fruit in bulk.< /text>

<review>Selection of processed food items is limited. Fresh items aren't that impressive. Wine prices are decent but the best is the dried fruits, nuts and grains. Can't be beat.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c33140c5ebe009:0x404f751f187998d2< /Gmap_id>< Name>

Wed morning...advertised cheese on sale, sign but no cheese..had to ask for it. Sample coffee area a mess...spilled coffee and milk, counter stained. Trash can over flowing at 11:00 am. Told an employee, said he would get it taken care of..not done at 11:30. Told cashier, said she would take care of it, just took next customer, did not tell anyone even after I told her I already  told someone.<//review>

This place sucks. Management is incompetent and unhelpful. Some of the employees are pretty nice, but that's about it. Just go to the Rancho Cucamonga location instead.</Review>

<Review>I was so excited when Sprout's announced that they were opening a store in Upland. They have the freshest  produce and usually for less money that the other grocery stores. They also have a nice bakery and meat counter in addition to health foods, organic everything, bulk items like nuts and cereals, and much more. Sprout's is a farmers market on steroids. The stores are always clean and have an opened layout. No cramped  2 cart wide isles with 6 foot high shelves, in Sprout's you can survey the whole store as you walk in the front door. Sprout's is located in the well maintained Upland Square Shopping Center which is on the corner of Foothill Blvd. and San Antonio Ave. It's in the same location that the old Alpha Beta grocery store occupied 40 or so years ago.< /Review>< user_id>

Customer service is terrible and there is always long long lines with only two cashiers at a time. Never any coffee and nothing but young kids work there and they are rude and disrespectful. Went in with my mother and was treated very disrespectfully by a cashier named Aryiana.</text>

I walked into Sprouts today and every item I looked at was $1 to $3 more than I pay for than I pay for them elsewhere. I will NEVER shop at Sprouts again! I quit Whole Foods ripoff and now I am quitting greedy sprouts.<//Review>

Btw, their soup makes you feel like home!</review></record>

<name>Judith Hower</name><Date>1615406679941< /Date><Rate>1</Rate><Text>I rarely order food to go because of income constraints. But I recently decided to splurge, and ordered Broccoli and Beef from Tahoe. The broccoli was absolutely inedible. I love raw broccoli, and always cook it al dente. But the broccoli in this order was like chewing on tree roots! The beef was FULL of grizzle...and the amount of beef was insulting. I have lived in Forestville for 41 years. The Chinese restaurant here has had multiple owners. The current owners are a pale comparison to the ones of the old days. So very disappointing.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Most uncomfortable feeling/ service we’ve ever had in Sonoma County. Waited for them to take our order and the staff just looked away and acted busy.  I wouldn’t recommend this place unless you’re blonde w/ blue eyes. They seem to get Served right away.< /text>

I go with my wife to this nice place often! This is my favorite spot to pass a nice evening.  I visit this spot frequently. The cooking is excellent, the crew is welcoming and the charge is fair. I like being in this restaurant over a good lunch.<//review>

Enjoyed it at first, but then the dj started talking and would not shut up.   Kept interrupting songs ever 5 second.   Not exaggerating.   We just had to leave.   Besides that,  service was pretty good. Good music.<//text>

Was a good place untill new management,new  rude and pervertive security  guys . They would fallow me and my fiance the whole night just cause hes bald, we let it pass since we thought it was just going to be that one time. But we went again and the same thing happen, didnt feel welcoming and having guards on me the whole  time oh no thank you. Ever since havent gone back.</text>

<Text>Evan helped me out by putting a Vintera 60s Jazzmaster on order for me, and he kept me updated throughout the entire wait. When it was clear that Fender was simply unable to give a reliable wait time due to unprecedented demand in 2020, we cancelled the order, no harm, no foul... and then he introduced me to the Strat that would eventually come home with me.

Before I even took her home, Brian did a complete setup job on it that included putting 10 gauge strings on, instead of the stock 9s. Makes a world of difference to me in terms of tactile response, since it’a what I use on all of my 25.5” scale guitars.

You won’t get better service than the fellas that work here can give you. They know what’s up, they care, and they do their very best to give you an experience worth coming back for. Even when I’ve been back just to window shop, I’ve wound up coming away with new knowledge and a good experience.

Thanks a lot, y’all. There’s hope for the future of musicians yet!< /Text>< pictures>

Best Music Store in Tri Valley area! Great service from friendly staff and Brian (stringed instrument tech) is probably the best guy you can take your instrument to in the area. I've taken several guitars to Jam's for various reasons and they always exceed expectations.<//Review>

Just had my Gibson ES-335 set up by their guitar tech. It’s never played better than it does now. I’ve brought two other guitars in for similar treatment, including some fret refurbishment on one. In all cases, excellent work!<//Text>

<text>I have a used Les Paul Standard that had terrible low E&A string buzz. No matter how I tried to set it up, I failed. It was so bad that I would not even play it. I took it to Brian and he had to do major work on the fret board which solved the problem.  It plays great and will now get my full attention by playing the hell out of it.< /text><rating>5</rating><Date>1584304558864</Date></record></dataset><record>

Not a big box store.  Nice stock of Taylor's and Mesa boogie as well as other guitars and gear.  Friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff.  Glad this store is here.

UPDATE:. After I posted original review.

Just wanted to add this.  My 89 custom Les Paul needed a set up and a new bridge.  My guitar has returned to the days of ruling the world with it's solid Rock and roll thunder.
Thank you!  The repairs and set up were very reasonable in terms of price and how long they had my guitar.  They completed the work a before the promise date.<//text>

Jams RULES! I've been coming to Brian for my guitar tune ups for a year now and couldn't be happier. He puts a lot of care into his work and it shows. Their showroom is always super clean with an awesome selection. The staff are always super friendly and welcoming. We are all lucky to have them as our local shop!!</Text>

<rating>5</rating><text>We were referred to JAMS by our children's high school band teacher in order to get our daughter's contrabass clarinet fixed. Ian at JAMS is AMAZING! The instrument was unplayable in the upper register due to a pretty good dent in the side (school horn), and with all of the incredibly hard work he put into that beast, it now plays like a dream! He called us while he was working on the horn to give us regular updates.What service! I will now bring in my own clarinet to get fixed, as it needs a complete overhaul. The store itself is also beautifully laid out with a gorgeous selection of instruments and gear. I am so happy to have such a great instrument repair and store so close to my home!<//text>< pics>

I have brought in 3 of my guitars to have either new pickups put in them or just general repair, fine tuning, fret level, fret dress, toggle switch replacement, etc. and love their pricing and work. My guitars never take more than a few business days to come back to me so appreciate the quick turn around as well.

Small businesses like these are gems in our neighborhoods and we should be supporting them!< /Review>

It's helpful to have a store like this in the area, but service leaves something to be desired. Customers should be served in the order they come in, not based upon how pushy they are. A simple "who's next" goes a long way<//text>

I've been going to Jams Music in Dublin, CA for a few years now. This spot has the best gear around and has by far the most knowledgeable and professional staff. The owner John is super nice and cool. They offer a wide verity of lessons and repairs on all types of instruments. I am a touring musicians and Brian in repairs works on all my guitars. I trust him with all types of repairs from small to big he has it handled. Don't waste your time or money at BS places like G.C. and help out by going to a local, solid business. I"ll never go anywhere else.</text>

The inventory and Customer Service is top shelf, no doubt. But their secret weapon is the Repair Shop. Brian is *amazing*. Always surprises me with a quick turn-around on my basses that I bring to him, and is always super congenial, and a total pro. I won't take my bass guitars anywhere else. Highly recommended!<//review>

Great repairs and very knowledgeable storekeepers regarding helping customers understand different items. I would have liked to see a better structured schedule for repairs so that I could drop off my instrument at the best time, but I understand how such a schedule can be difficult to create.</Review>

<text>Great staff, friendly atmosphere, can always strike up a conversation about some piece of gear or another.
If you need your instrument setup, Brian is your man! He does a wonderful job, especially on those pesky floyd rose bridges. High recommend this place.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Every time I enter into JAMS Music, they are so well prepared to assist me with any guitar needs / repairs that I may have. They have fixed up my Epiphone acoustic to play like new!

Their owner, John runs a first-class operation, and his passion for inspiring the music world is evident from the top down.

It's clear to see that JAMS Music's staff are all very relational: you get the small business intimacy with a large business selection of high-quality products. Simply put, I am impressed with their lessons staff, retail floor and general business practices. I highly recommend this store to anyone with who loves learning, practicing and jamming with any instrument!<//review>< user_id>

Staff knows the products inside and out. Good amount of space dedicated to lessons, and is a dealer for Mesa Boogie. They also just started to carry EVH and they have Boss katana on hand in various sizes. They have Taylor and Ibanez acoustics, as well as a bunch of other brands I can't seem to remember. They had a bunch of ukuleles and I noticed some trumpets and clarinets. Seems like most things are represented here. Drums could have more space, but they just expanded, and I bet it could be on the way.</Review>

Walking trail is nice. Park lawn us a bit hazardous due to tree roots coming up through soil, randomly cut down trees with very low stumps. Took my kids there to play on lawn since playground is closed and we had to be very careful where ran because of the very uneven terrain. Other Fremont parks have much better open areas.</text>

Nice park for local people , not very clean, I think people should feel proud about such a local park and preserve it and not to throw garbage here and there, though park is pretty much clean but some traces of papers and bags noticed
Very peaceful and safe place
Really nice slides etc for 2 to 6 year old kids</review>

Worst experience of my life. I started my rental process a MONTH early as we got closer to my move in date it got harder and harder to get in touch with people in the office. Calls, emails constantly unanswered. I would cc multiple people and no one would respond. A week before the move I have no answers and no idea of what I’m supposed to do. I make more calls no response, finally send an email asking to get my deposit back and go elsewhere since they apparently didn’t care about my business. No one returned my calls or email. Now they’re trying to keep my deposit and told my bank we have a lease. But I don’t live there. This place is not worth it, was going to consider for the future but they’re bad business and really just want your money. They don’t care about you. Look at the low rating and the complaints from residents. The office told me it wAs just people upset but apparently it’s very much the real experience. I called again yesterday and still haven’t received a callback.

Update: Management reached out to me and we were able to resolve the issue. This dramatically changed my experience and perhaps I will try renting again in the future.<//Text>

<review>We have been living here for almost 6 months, and we have been nothing but impressed. Staff has been wonderful - that includes everyone from leasing to maintenance. We are very happy to residing here - we feel like we can really rely on the staff to respond to our questions/requests professionally and in a timely manner.

I love the neighborhood, love the culture of the community, and most of all, I LOVE having access to a safe green space within the complex where I can get some fresh air any time of day or night.<//review><Time>1602783942786< /Time>< Name>

<date>1602188738893< /date><text>I’ve been a resident here for 2 months now. My experience with the leasing center has been great. Sometimes you need to wait a long time for them to pick up but that’s because they gets tons of calls nonstop everyday. After moving in, we found the apartment clean but had some areas that needed repairing and the residence service is quick to resolve them for us. The location is the best part about this apartment. Close to everything. Package center is great too, I saw a few comments about losing packages or important mail but that’s mostly on the delivery company not the Fillmore center staff. People make mistakes and delivery people aren’t mistake-proof, give them a break. Nice affordable apartment choice!< /text>< pics>

It all starts from the top.  Greystar seems to be a great property management company.   When things are brought to their attention, they act.  And they act quickly.  Thank you to Greystar.
But why does it take that long?  Every property has a GM on site so there should be no reason why Greystar should get involved.  We pay $3300 per month for a one bedroom.  All we are asking for is 'on site' support.< /Text>

Justin and Giovani are amazing! - Move-in can be really stressful, but they definitely did a great job, despite how busy they are trying to pivot during this pandemic craziness and the world of virtual tours that we live in.
Justin, is professional, friendly and definitely calm enough to handle a crazy move- Thank you Justin!
*On the other hand, Greystar (the management company) is very hard to work with and will definitely not give them 5 stars.< /Text>

<time>1597962205443<//time><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Apartments are centrally located but service/management is pretty bad.

You cannot get a hold of anyone in the office. This includes when inquiring about leases. Rory seems to be the main person who takes care of it but never responds. We have tried contacting him several times (emails, calls, office visits) and even had appointments for him to call us on extending or changing our lease but he never did so we were forced to search for a new apartment. Samuel is probably the only person who genuinely tries to help or respond to messages. Even going into the office one of the girls has joked they "don't pick up the phone" when it was ringing right in front of her. So while COVID his happening and the offices remain closed, it's almost impossible to get a response from management.

It doesn't seem to be good for business if they don't respond to requests about lease extensions or applications...

EDIT 8/20:
Received response from the owner below to contact them at the same number my roommates and I have been calling and leaving messages at but have received zero responses from. Also the number that they joke they never pick up at. They copy/paste the same response on every persons complaint.< /Text>< pictures>

<text>Long story short: The Fillmore Center doesn't care about people who have been severely financially impacted by the pandemic. Details below.

I've live here for over a year and resigned my lease in February. Then the pandemic hit a few weeks later. My girlfriend and I both work in the hospitality industry and were immediately out of work.

Initially, I made some phone calls to ask what the Fillmore Center was doing to help during this unprecedented time. I was told to be patient and that they would get back to me. They didn't get back to me. For the past 6-months, I've sent numerous emails, filled out several forms explaining our financial misfortune, spoken with people in person. Invariably, these conversations have fallen on deaf ears, I've been ghosted, ignored, forgotten about.

It's now 6 months later and after paying our rent with unemployment money. We've hit a dead end and now need to move out because we can't afford it anymore. There are many cheaper options on the market now and we need to find something better. The Fillmore Center has neglected us in every way and is now telling us that we need to pay them 2-months rent or $7,000 in order to move on from this disaster. Was this stipulated in our lease? Yes, it was. But given the unprecedented times that we are going through, I thought that someone here would have some shred of human decency and understanding to find some kind of compromise.

Hospitality workers are getting crushed due to this pandemic with no end in sight. The Fillmore Center doesn't care though. They'll just ignore you and happily kick you in the gut when you're at your lowest point and have given up.</text>< Pictures>

<time>1546750417501</time><Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I've lived in apartments and rented my whole life and this was by far the worst experience I've ever had start to finish. I just finished a 2 year lease.

First of all ask the leasing agent when the elevator was replaced in the building you are looking at. I had the unfortunate pleasure of going through the replacing experience. Long story short about a year of only one working at a time and occasionally having to take the stairs from the 14th floor, long wait times, and dealing with angry neighbors. It's like riding the bus. Several times the one that was working would go out.

Things were constantly falling apart in the unit. The main closet collapsed in my unit 3 times! Every time the maintenance people would say, "it looks like the last guy did a bad job". They are nice enough but don't seem to be trained very well.

Packages - By far the biggest headache here. Do not be fooled by the Luxor system, it's always a complete mess. The delivery drivers may leave your packages in 3 different locations on the property, none of which are your front door. Expect to be chasing mail around. over 2 years I had roughly 7 packages stolen or "lost" here.

Every time you need anything from the office staff they say,  "Oh So and so needs to answer that question and they are conveniently out to lunch". This happend to me countless times including the simple question of "what is my final rent amount" - This took 3 staff members to figure out and about 45 mins of my day.

They charge you a cleaning fee when you move out if the unit is not "market ready". My unit wasn't even market ready when I took possession. The vinyl floor was ripped and there was a huge candle burn in one the cabinets that took them 2 months to replace. My carpet wasn't new and had visible signs of wear and tear. On top of the couple hundred dollar cleaning fee they ended up hitting me for an extra $100 or so of my deposit with no notes or explanation. I called and they said (as you may have guessed from the previous passage), "Oh so and so needs to answer that and she's out, I'll transfer you to her voicemail". I left a message and got no reply whatsoever.

Security guards to walk around and occasionally run people off but expect sketchy characters at all hours of the day lurking around the building and in the common areas. It's also common to see random piles of puke in the common areas on the weekends.

Do yourself a huge favor and waste your money elsewhere.< /Review>< Pics>

The Package Center is pretty inconsistent with whether or not you'll get your packages - Amazon for most of the cases since the carriers aren't delivering the packages to the Package Center.

I'd strongly consider sending your packages (despite being incredibly inconvenient) to a friend's house instead (anything Amazon or expensive)

Management seems overwhelmed, GreyStar (who manages the Fillmore Center) doesn't seem to responds to inquiries or complaints/issues.</Text>

I guess I am done with this place. Missed my most important mail and couldn't find it anywhere... That's my working visa original... I shouldn't trust the package center here and choose to ship my mail to the home address. There are some huge problems in terms of management. Gonna move asap.<//text>

I am going to copy/paste the email I sent to the Residence Service Manager 45 days ago with several issues. Btw, I did not receive any answer when I asked for a meeting to see how they were going to fix them:

- lost packages, it is happening very often (Amazon prime here is not very useful, even if Amazon delivers a Monday, you won't receive until a week later)
- when you cut the water without any previous communication,
- moves done anytime of day, causing huge delays in the elevator,
- when you let us know about the rent increase 4 days prior to the renovation,
-when we go with our clothes to the laundry and we find out that sometimes works, sometimes does not... and we need to go to a completely different one to be able to wash them, after wasting time and money (this happened during 3 weeks at least).

this email was sent after being 2 months with fan noise  that could be heard every night... the maintenance service finally fix it, but residence service was not aware and they sent an email (10 days later!! nice follow up...) saying there as not issue at all, that we were making up the noise...<//Review>

Awesome location. Really enjoyed Saturday farmer's market, which is around the corner and Sunday Jazz performance. Only complaint is that dog owners don't clean up.< /Text>

<response>{'time': 1589554484361, 'text': "Hello there,  Thank you for sharing your experience with our team. We understand the situation with the elevators and are happy to let you know the elevators in your building are some of the newest ones we have.  In addition, there are some other elevators in the community which are scheduled to have a full modernization project later this year as this project, among others, have been on hold due to the current state ordinance. It is also not common for communities to have multiple move-ins and move-outs that occur during the same time within the same building.  To manage the impact as best possible for our other residents, we adhere to allowing move-ins and move-outs between 8am and 5pm Sunday through Friday, and 2pm to 5pm on Saturdays in your building, due to access to our loading dock. We also ask that our residents have packages delivered to the lockers or to our in-house managed packaged room. It's really disappointing that not all carriers will comply and sometimes leave packages in the lobbies of each building. We continuously work with the carriers and their local delivery people to deliver to the correct package rooms.  Pricing is determined on the current market rate which can fluctuate daily, and we are lucky enough to offer a convenient location at affordable prices within our market. Our team is also looking forward to being able to do more resident events once this ordinance is over and hope to see you there! In the meantime, please reach out to us if you need anything. Thank you!"}<//response>< Name>

<time>1587426480745<//time><review>Apartments themselves are decent for the city, but the elevators are a constant issue (slow and not dependable along with having people move in and out at all times of the day - no standard times for move-in/move-out, and no cargo elevators - would be better if they standardized so people aren't constantly surprised by it.). The worst issue is the package management as packages get stolen all the time (they need package management, not the lockers that not all carriers use - as it is most likely your neighbors that steal it since it's only people with fob access that should be able to get in). Price hikes are 5% which is higher than what you see from other properties and the neighborhood itself has definitely gotten worse in terms of safety & loitering. Staff has gotten better since the previous owners, but they need to fix processes to be more resident centric - hopefully this group will do it.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

<text>The building and apartment are ok, but the location is very dangerous.
Some people living in the same building seem to be addicts or  part of a lower rent program for homeless. Nothing against that, but some were asking for money at the elevators, littering, puking, fighting,  etc. Not a safe place at all for kids.
Leasing renewal will have a huge % increase unless you sign another full year contract, so do not count with the month-to-month renewal.
Stay away for units facing Turk St, even in front the Police Station, it is close to the freaking McDonalds, MiniPark, and 3rd World Market, all of them places for gangs and addicts gatherings.
Packages are lost or stolen there, I recommend to use only the Amazon Locker by the Gym and pray for USPS, Fedex, UPS packages.
The Washers and Dryers machines do not work sometimes, so be prepared to wait for them to be fixed (usually 1-2 days).
Security people are not friendly at all, so be ready for a scary, non-friendly, ans very slow service moving in and out.< /text><GmapID>0x808580b99d0b1e71:0xcf5bc1bb2f57b40c<//GmapID><Date>1598833058180</Date><pictures>None</pictures>< username>

<Review>I post a review in 5 years maybe but I cannot make myself forget all the horrible things this company has done to me. The Fillmore Center completely humiliated me and disrespected in all the ways they could have, ignoring me for weeks and forcing me to move out with their extreme incompetence.

< Review>
I've lived in apartments and rented my whole life and this was by far the worst experience I've ever had start to finish. I just finished a 2 year lease.

First of all ask the leasing agent when the elevator was replaced in the building you are looking at. I had the unfortunate pleasure of going through the replacing experience. Long story short about a year of only one working at a time and occasionally having to take the stairs from the 14th floor, long wait times, and dealing with angry neighbors. It's like riding the bus. Several times the one that was working would go out.

Things were constantly falling apart in the unit. The main closet collapsed in my unit 3 times! Every time the maintenance people would say, "it looks like the last guy did a bad job". They are nice enough but don't seem to be trained very well.

Packages - By far the biggest headache here. Do not be fooled by the Luxor system, it's always a complete mess. The delivery drivers may leave your packages in 3 different locations on the property, none of which are your front door. Expect to be chasing mail around. over 2 years I had roughly 7 packages stolen or "lost" here.

Every time you need anything from the office staff they say,  "Oh So and so needs to answer that question and they are conveniently out to lunch". This happend to me countless times including the simple question of "what is my final rent amount" - This took 3 staff members to figure out and about 45 mins of my day.

They charge you a cleaning fee when you move out if the unit is not "market ready". My unit wasn't even market ready when I took possession. The vinyl floor was ripped and there was a huge candle burn in one the cabinets that took them 2 months to replace. My carpet wasn't new and had visible signs of wear and tear. On top of the couple hundred dollar cleaning fee they ended up hitting me for an extra $100 or so of my deposit with no notes or explanation. I called and they said (as you may have guessed from the previous passage), "Oh so and so needs to answer that and she's out, I'll transfer you to her voicemail". I left a message and got no reply whatsoever.

Security guards to walk around and occasionally run people off but expect sketchy characters at all hours of the day lurking around the building and in the common areas. It's also common to see random piles of puke in the common areas on the weekends.

Do yourself a huge favor and waste your money elsewhere.<//Review>

<Review>First getting a lease at this place was a pretty terrible experience because the leasing office literally never answers the phone. I was in their office, called, and watched them ignore the phone. As for the Resident Center, Samuel is one in a million. He is super friendly and helpful no matter how many people are packed in there griping at him. He's by far the employee of the year at this place. Great attitude and great resident service.

<review>I've lived here 2 years ago and my $5,000 bike was stolen within view of a security camera. Management refused to provide the security camera footage needed by my insurance company so I was out of a $5,000 bike and was afraid to buy a new one because I don't want another bike to just be stolen again. All management provided were excuses and silence so my only assumption was that all of the security cameras around this property are fake so I no longer felt safe in my own home and promptly moved somewhere safer. Because of poor management, I not only lost a $5,000 bike, I lost a home.< /review><username>Z Z<//username><Pics>None</Pics>< time>

People at both the security rooms and resident services are bad service and disrespectful. I don’t even know how they manage their workers because they can’t even get the job done properly. I am a student and a resident myself and I am only satisfied with the living area but nothing else. Getting your package delivered correctly is a pain every time. I hope someone who manages the Fillmore Center hire better staffs or get them trained properly. Very disappointed.< /Text>

<Text>The leasing staff has been absolutely perfect when I came in to visit apartments. They really took the time to understand what I was looking for and my timing, yet not overselling anything. I've had the opportunity to visit all of the available units matching my needs in different buildings.

EDIT: After posting this review, the leasing office has been much more responsive. Ely in particular is amazing - thanks for everything so far, Ely!
.

I've been trying to get ahold of the leasing office for the past week and I can't get anyone on the phone. Out of probably 20 calls (to multiple numbers) I've only had one answered, I've left voicemails and sent emails that all were ignored. All I'm trying to do is set up a virtual tour and get an update on my application.

I totally understand that we are in unprecedented times and working remotely is a challenge, but going full business days without answering a single call? Leaving emails without a response for a full week?

Based on the floor plans and the amenities, I was really looking forward to renting with The Fillmore Center, but if this experience is any indication of how they treat their tenants, I think I'm better off renting somewhere else.</Review>

As someone who lived here for 3 years, if you can I'd recommend living somewhere else. The units are nice and I enjoy the neighborhood—but any time you need to do anything remotely official with the leasing office/security/property managers be prepared for the most pedantic, procedural, robotic and difficult experience possible.

Moving in? Be prepared to have a loading dock scheduled and finish within exactly their time window or good luck finding a place for the truck, not their problem. Reserve an elevator? First be prepared that the other elevator will break in these old buildings—and for the security office to dock time from your reservation if they see you move any items before your scheduled window. Turning in keys? Everyone must turn them all in at the exact same moment even if you have roommates. Something broken? Maybe you'll get it fixed in the same week if you're lucky. Want to use their outdoor spaces or grills? Make a reservation by phone, walk a few blocks to security, and leave your ID. Packages? Be prepared to walk multiple blocks to their holding area, where you must pick up your package asap or have it sent back (if it gets there, and isn't just left in a lobby and stolen). It honestly goes on and on, my housemates and I really dreaded any time we'd have to do anything regarding management.

Don't expect much help outside of official guidelines, don't expect anyone to care if you're a good or long term resident, expect your rent to raise by the maximum allowable amount each year with the least amount of notice legally allowable. No accommodations will be made for you as a person ever—but they expect you to go above and beyond as a resident. As a bonus the fire alarm will go off and cause an evacuation probably once every few months (at least I got to meet the neighbors).

It really isn't hard to find communities even in the area that offer either better amenities for the price (seriously these units will always be priced at top of market, but the buildings don't add up), or smaller more human apartment management. 2 stars because I'd like to believe their generally all good people in a tough situation, it's just a bad set of buildings and bad company with likely crazy internal guidelines.<//Text>

a current resident here and thinking move out. Such a bad experience living here. 1. there was gun shot every year in Fillmore Street, 2. the fire alarm rang twice last month. 3. package receiving is such a chaos, 4. terrible stuff in the resident service and keep changing every quarter or so.  To be honest only the rent is decent comparing to other place but now I can see it comes with a cost.<//review>

The leasing office and resident office staff are so helpful, friendly, and patient helping over 1000 tenants each month. And while there have been several maintenance issues and renovation projects that have arisen since the beginning of the year, the Fillmore Center has done their best to resolve said issues as they come up. So far living here has been really nice and pleasant! Kudos to Brianna and Giovanni from the leasing office--love them!< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Very strong sunlight if your window faces East or West. Plants thrive.

Fast maintenance, though I went over a year with nothing needed. Chuck is their best maintenance guy. He's there like 30 years; he takes one look at something and knows how to fix it in 10 minutes.

Spacious garden / waterfall / bbq's between Ofarrell and Eddy Streets. In the center, the trees block all man made structures, and you can't hear anything but the waterfall. It feels like the middle of a forest.

They have security guards 24/7, and there is a police station adjacent at Turk and Fillmore St.

They use these water blasters on the outside of the building. It takes off the top layer and makes the buildings look brand new. The hallways and lobby have recently been redone quite artistically, though they haven't quite finished all the buildings yet. (Most of the rooms are renovated within the past five years with quartz or granite counters. It was a major improvement. If someone told you the buildings were brand new, you would struggle to come up with grounds to disbelieve.)

They also give a free annual carpet cleaning, if you pick one of the carpeted apartments.

It is hard to rent right now because Corona has large buildings like this refusing to let customers enter the actual apartments, and web cam's only show so much, but this development is a safe bet.

Highly efficient parking setup. They have a lot of empty spots, so it is fast in and out. It couldn’t be more painless even if you had a personal valet.
Excellent value overall, and excellent management always willing to hear your issues. Usually incredibly flexible. Familial corporate culture - it's like talking to your sister.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Pros - Near the Japantown/Lower Pac Heights, many parks within the vicinity, a Fitness SF gym right around the corner, some very nice people who work the Front Desk & Maintenance (shoutout to Samuel, Emmanuel, Dmitri and Jose), the interior of the apartments are renovated and clean (The last two are the only reason this doesn't get a 1-star review)

Cons - Where to begin. Living in the M1 building the past year, here is a quick run down. The leasing process is problematic to say the least and is a source of frustration and confusion for many former/current residents.  The building was supposed to be updated within a few months of moving in, took most of the last year to do so and looks like a flashback to an 80's rundown casino (I know I used to work in Las Vegas). The elevators are constantly broken and sometimes both at the same time so good luck with that. The laundry machines once broke down for a few weeks at one point. We once had blue water coming out of our taps (no explanation or heads up given). Also, be aware that the package delivery system is bound to lose one your valuables (never received any compensation for packages that were left out by delivery services that were subsequently taken by someone else other than us). And lastly, when it comes times to renew, you will notice that there are similar units in the building offered at lower prices than what you are paying, but management will make no effort to offer a concession (as if not retaining a current and paying resident is a more financially prudent decision than trying to get someone else to move in.) The low star ratings that most give here are completely warranted and if you move-in here and expect anything different you are surely going to be disappointed.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>
{'time': 1591140101721, 'text': "Hi Ricky,  Thank you for sharing your detailed review. We appreciate that you highlighted the hard work and dedication of our team members. We work very hard to ensure our community looks its best and our residents have a great overall experience. We are also grateful that you mentioned our clean and renovated homes. However, we are disappointed to read your other comments and are not aware of any blue water coming out of your faucet. Also, we do have plans to fix the elevators in the building you lived in. However, the state ordinance has put a delay on this, and many other projects were also put on hold. We really wish that we can address this and other issues sooner but unfortunately cannot due to the shelter-in-place notice. We are happy to let you know that the laundry machines were replaced with brand new ones about a year ago. As well, when the internet service of the card readers went down, we happily provided our residents free service for weeks until it was resolved. In regards to package delivery, we go over this in detail upon move in and it’s also outlined in your lease that states we are not responsible for our residents packages. We have come a long way with how we manage the delivery of packages and really put emphasis on resident experience. We understand that there is always room for improvement and we do have issues with certain carriers and their delivery policies. Often times it is the delivery driver that doesn't properly deliver the package. We have seen numerous deliveries left in the lobby, misdelivering them or leaving them in an open locker. Lastly, we offered our recent lease renewals the option to stay at their current rate. Each home is priced differently and we always try to work with our residents to find ways for them to stay at The Fillmore Center community. We never want any of our residents leaving our community feeling the way that you do. Please reach out to us if we can be of assistance or if you would like us to clarify anything for you.

I've lived here for 1 year starting from 2018.
Pros: It's convenient for accessing muni, restaurant and Japanese/Korea grocery.
Cons:
1. Resident office and Leasing office is not responsible. They are not friendly and hard to communicate. Very easy to lose package, hard to request fix, hard to track your deposit... etc
2. Not a very safe place. Had shooting and rub happened several times in this area.
3. Noisy. Bad sound isolation in the apartment and also very noisy outside.</Review>

I really enjoyed living here for a year. Great location, literally right in the middle of SF so close to everything.  The view is unobstructed on the high floor. There are a few SF best restaurants at your doorsteps. Having the gym downstairs is amazing and I was motivated to go everyday for a few hours since it only took 3 minutes to get changed and be there! The post / parcel system is efficient. Neighbours seem nice but don’t really hang out with them like in other buildings in FiDi. The only thing is the deposit took a while to get back but got sorted at the end.< /review>

<review>People in the leasing office are incompetent and rude.
I called to get some information about available units, which would take 5 minutes at max to answer, but it took me 30 minutes to just schedule for an appointment with the leasing office. Again, this is not a tour of the unit that was available, just an appointment to ask few questions I have.

During the tiresome 30 min call with the leasing office, I was put on hold for 5 times (each hold was about 5 minutes) without any specific reason. I totally get dealing with tenants can be hectic at times, but I don't understand what could possibly have higher priority than a future tenant who's been on the phone for almost 30 minutes.

I was expecting to schedule for a tour, but they told me that it depends on the availability of units on my appointment day. Already wasting 30 minutes on the phone, and all I got was a single appointment to ask less than 10 questions that could've been easily answered over the phone. The tone of the leasing manager felt like they either didn't care or just didn't feel like answering questions.

What threw me off was the appointment itself. I scheduled my appointment during Friday lunch, and when I got there, they just told me the appointment has been canceled. Who cancels appointments without any notice to the other party? I came all the way from work for this appointment, but didn't end up getting one, and had to go back for nothing. I tried to at least ask the questions I had prior to the appointment. But they just told me to schedule for another appointment.

The property seems nice (at least on the pictures, since I never got a chance to set a foot in one of the units they have), but people in the leasing office are atrocious. If building owner/management really do care about keeping good reputation of this place, instead of replying to every single reviews like a bot, please evaluate your employee's manners and competency to hire better people.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

She was very informative during my search and showed me several units with different floor plans, always making time to do tours after work, which was helpful because there is much more floor plan variety than is apparent from the website.  The units are fairly large for being in the middle of the city, with all the conveniences of a large apartment complex plus the perks of being down the street from the shops and restaurants of fillmore street.  It’s also great that there is a real gym (fitness sf) right in the lobby of my building.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><name>Esther Melamed< /name><review>Please let me know how I can reach the people in the leasing office regarding an upcoming move-in, as I have been trying for days and have been unsuccessful.
Am happy to call at any time that is convenient but it is very frustrating to call endlessly when the office is supposed to be open and be unable to reach anyone.

To update the above - I did receive a call back and a response via email.
I would say, however, that their message center is not set up in an effective way and leads to an unnecessarily annoying experience in trying to reach anyone.

Further update to the above. After the initial difficulties everything has progressed smoothly and there have been no further issues. Communication has been good and Brianna in the leasing office has been extremely helpful. The apartment is newly renovated and is even better than anticipated. I am confident that the move-in will be without complications.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< UserId.>

The apartment is ok (except for packages usually being missing), but it has been a terrible experience dealing with people at the resident service office. I am not sure if this is because I am Asian or they do this to everyone, I am treated with bad attitude and impatient tone during almost every of my few visits in the past 2 years.

My recent experience of moving out has been a nightmare. One month before the lease end date, we received an email saying if you want to renew the lease you need to do XYZ, and your lease will expire if you don't do XYZ, which made us believe that there is no action needed if you want to move out and terminate your lease. Before that I also called the office and mentioned that I'll pass the offer as the rent increased significantly. Yesterday we were told that there was no 30 day move-out notice from us (excuse me?) and they also require a move-out notice from a previous tenant who moved out more than half a year ago (excuse me?!) in order to initiate the move-out process. And because we don't have this, they are charging us the additional rent after we move out, and at a much higher rate that is incredibly high, without any prior notice. My roommate and her friend was there, and they were treated with extremely bad attitude when she was trying to explain that we already gave the move-out notice 30 days ago. We also connected with the manager in the afternoon but all we heard is we owe them money and the call was ended abruptly.

I am emailing the office again hoping that they will follow up on this issue. Will follow up on this review if there is any updates. For now just want to remind all current and future residents, please take EXTRA CAUTION of your lease and the misleading lease renewal email and when dealing with people at the resident services office.< /text><date>1572655546823< /date>< Pics>

1. We have experienced continuous loud party upstairs for the entire year. People were screaming and jumping all night long. We have complained a thousand times to the leasing office, but they never replied the email or address the problem. All they did was to say 'we apologize'. Who needs an apology? Can't you just do something to stop this from happening?!

2. The maintenance support is super slow! We waited weeks just for fixing the lighting bulb in the bathroom...we reported several times, and they finally sent people to fix it after we complained to the manager. There is another time when the ceiling is leaking. They just sent a person to stab the dripping bubble, and that's it! They never came back to fix the hole.

3. The staff were playing tricks with us only to charge us money when our lease was about to expire. We moved from the east coast so we did not know about the 30 day written notice rule. But on the day that's exactly 30 days prior to our lease end time, we did walk into the leasing office and told the staff that we wanted to move out because we had the noise issue. However, the staff said 'oh instead of ending your lease, you can do a transfer to another unit'. Then they gave us a quote on a unit that is not available for viewing. They even said we could wait for a few days for viewing. So, on that day, they knew our lease is expiring in 30 days, and they knew we intend to move out, but they gave us a suggestion that is totally & ONLY beneficial to themselves. So after a few days, when we checked if the quoted unit is available for viewing, they said the unit is gone! Plus, we are late for the written notice! And we need to pay $1500 extra! Only at that time did they tell us that in order to move out we need to fill out a bunch of forms! What can I say?! Why didn't you just give us those forms when we said we wanted to end the lease? Why did you suggest us to do a transfer?! Isn't this a pure setup?! Maybe on legal-wise we cannot do anything, but this just shows what kind of people they are!! Really bad people!! They do not care about the residents at all! All they care is money! They try everything to grab the business at the tenants' own risks! They are the worst people I have ever met!

Look at the score they have - 2.6 out of 5? No wonder they have so many negative reviews here!! Stay away from this apartment!!

<rate>1</rate><Review>WORST place I ever lived! WARNING, don't consider leasing here!!!!!

I've been lived here for almost an year, and thank god my lease is ending soon. The management of Fillmore Center definitely has a fricking serious problem. They spent all the budget on renovating the units, amenities, leasing center, and every other things to attract more new tenants, but they spent wayyyy too less effort in taking care of the existing tenants!
They never have enough staff in the resident service center to help, as there's always a huge line of tenants waiting for help, and most of them are simply trying to get their package, which ironically was never put in in our package room.
And this is just one of other hundred problems they have, so in short, horrible place with way too few staff in responding / maintaining the service for tenants. DONT CONSIDER HERE!<//Review>< Pictures>

I am completely sure that our packages were delivered to resident services. They just kept telling us to check Luxer and our mailbox. One of my roommates said she had been looking for her packages for over a month but resident services just said that they cannot find her package it should be a problem with her delivery carrer, USPS. HOWEVER, after a month I went to resident services to get my package but they found my roommates package that had been missing for over a month. This is extremely ridiculous. Today, my other roommate went to resident services to get her package that was sent from the same store, both were delivered at the same time and signed for at the same time. Only ONE package was found. Resident Services said that they cannot find the other package and to contact the shipper because no one with that name works at the office, then how was one package found and the other not? It came from the same shipper from the exact same store. Since Resident Services told us that they return packages if they're not picked up within 3 days we always go on the first or second day but they keep saying come back tomorrow well if we come back on the 3rd day how do we know that our packages are not already returned for no reason?<//Review>< UserId.>

Management needs to do a better job. Leasing office very courteous and professional. I have been complaining of a smoker for the last five and a half months. NOTHING has been done to improve my husband and I's living situation here. One of the leasing agents attempted to address this situation but had to turn control over to the The Community Manager, Patti Quinsay. Patti told me in an email four months ago that we "lived in a smoking building". This entire property is non-smoking, something that the Community Manager should be aware of. I'm not sure about most people but we prefer to not have our neighbor smoking so much inside of their apartment that our laundry room smells of the smoke, we cannot open our windows if the neighbor is home and I've had to tape over the old phone jack just to prevent the smell from coming into our place.  If we leave clothes in the dryer, they have to be rewashed due to the smell. I have sent repeated emails to Patti over the last three weeks and have yet to receive a reply. Courtesy patrol just simply knocks on their door and that is the extent of what they can do here. I've contacted corporate but even corporate doesn't return phonecalls.  We're pretty frustrated at this point and The Fillmore Center needs to get this issue resolved.< /Text>

Leasing Agent: 5 stars
Apartment: 5 stars
Value: 4 stars
Application and Leasing Experience: 1 star

This review is not a criticism of the the individual people who work at The Fillmore Center or the quality of the apartments themselves. This is a review of the awful established processes and management I experienced as a new renter. Our leasing agent was lovely, but there were many things that were out of their control that were just plain awful.

It often took 3 or 4 days to hear back on an emails requesting any status updates on our application, and the updates were basically "still working on it". I called the leasing office about 6 times during business hours over the course of over a week and never once was my call answered. Voicemail every time. It took well over 2 weeks from the day we submitted our application to the day of signing a lease, even with me regularly pestering them for updates. This is about 2 weeks longer than it takes any other company I have rented from. This process should take 48-72 hours at most in my experience renting from Mosso, RentSFNow, and EmeraldFund properties.

The required application agreement is VERY sketchy and questionably legal... By submitting your application and a $1000 "Application Deposit" (note: it's not a security deposit) you sign an agreement that if they accept your application and you for whatever reason do not sign the lease within 3 days, they keep your $1000 as "damages".

Also, the leasing agents assure you all packages are handled by resident services, yet walking into the mail area reveals stacks of packages sitting on the floor in highly trafficked public areas.</Text>

< Review>
I was a resident at the Fillmore Center for 5 years. Despite leaving the apartment in perfect condition when I moved out, they violated the lease agreement and have not returned my security deposit within the 21 days guaranteed by the lease and under state law. It has been more than 7 weeks now, and I was told by the general manager that they knew of the 21 day limit but didn't bother to adhere to it because their payment system was down and they didn't feel like manually processing my check. Despite their clearly illegal behavior, both their accountant and general manager repeatedly dodged my calls, emails, voicemails, and even in-person visits to their offices (where I was treated rudely by front desk staff) for more than 4 weeks, and now I am forced to sue in order to get my money back. I would not recommend this place. I was honestly shocked at their blatant disregard of the lease terms and the law, as well as their poor treatment of a long term resident.</Review>

I came in and signed an application and a lease agreement the other day. After paying the initial deposit and signing all the contracts, I was told that, pending approval, everything would be good to go and ready for me to move in. A couple of hours later, I was emailed and told that the price is actually 300 more dollars and that to make up for their mistake they would "give me an extra week to move in."

First of all, I'm not even sure that it's legal that you can change a price after the contract has been signed. But apparently, they were unwilling to budge and honor the price stated in the contract. I told them I shouldn't be penalized for a mistake they made, but they were unwilling to offer an acceptable solution. I'm sure this somehow goes against tenant's rights or fair housing laws, but we'll see.

Secondly, it seems like a total scam that they attract you with a great price, show you the unit, have you sign up, and then raise the price after you're midway through. Maybe it was an honest mistake. But you know what, accept responsibility and don't punish the applicant/tenant.

Luckily, I was able to get my full deposit back and cancel the whole process without being penalized. If I could give them 0 stars I would, but unfortunately you at least have to give 1 to leave a review.

With this experience in mind, I definitely will not be visiting this apartment complex in the future, and I caution everyone else who plans to rent from these guys. This totally astounds me. I've never had an apartment complex call me back after all the documents have been signed to raise the price. Ridiculous and unacceptable.<//review>

My move into The Fillmore Center over the past week has been a fabulous experience. I moved from Denver to SF and every aspect of this transition has gone exceptionally well.

I first worked with Joseph over a year ago when he gave me a tour, and he has delivered on every promise made to me that day. When my time was right to lease an apartment, we did the whole thing remotely and it the process went perfectly.

I have a fabulous studio that was newly renovated (all new appliances and finishes), incredible view to the east and I couldn't be happier. The building is quiet (concrete walls), well-kept grounds and facilities and I love the location. Great food and drink a short walk away, public transportation and quieter than living further east.

Joseph isn't the only Rock Star at The Fillmore Center. Everyone in the Leasing Office has been amazing, Danielle in Resident Services has helped me numerous times as I learn the Luxer Locker process, the folks in Security to help with reserving a freight elevator, etc.

My experience has been all that I had hoped for as I start a new chapter in my life as an empty nester in San Francisco!< /Review>

The only thing the Fillmore Center has going for it is it is located in a central location in San Francisco.

The complex is located next to a not so good part of town and it bleeds over in the area. I have friends that are frightened to visit.

Their security is there but not staffed accordingly to facilitate such a large complex. Cars have been broken into in "Secure Parking" several times.

The facilities smell bad. The stairs smell like urine the halls like smoke. Often times there are people smoking in the stairwell.

Amenities you pay for have been shutdown for half the year. They are renovating the BBQ area but gave no notice and they are closed for 4-5 months.

They are hard to get a hold of if you need to.

They have a shuttle to financial but it often doesn't show up. It is a pain when you have to be to work and the shuttle just doesn't show up. They have decided to institute a new fee for an ID system for then shuttle and they pass the cost to you.

They try and raise the rent astronomical amounts after your first year. 7-10%

They nickel and dime you with hidden fees.

When they sell it it sounds great. Then you live here and you realize it isn't.<//text>

After years of insane rent hikes (the last one was $600/month, "negotiated" down to a $500/month, i.e. $6000/year hike) and not wanting to deal with the devilish leasing manager Carlos anymore I've moved. Glad to be rid of the joint!

I lived in the Fillmore Center for six years. It's an ok place to live, but there are some strong downsides to renting here.

The downsides:
- The management company does the bare minimum to maintain the place.
- The leasing manager, Carlos, is horrible to deal with. He claims to have no say as to what you're paying and just tells you to move out if you don't like the prices (I eventually did). They should just replace him with a form letter for all the use he is. One of the worst parts of the Fillmore Center.
- The apartments are old (around 25 years old now) but the outside, leasing office, and show apartments are kept to look up-to-date. Check out your apartment before signing the lease or you might end up with a 90s special!
- Rent goes up every year. Expect a 10-20% increase (i.e. thousands of dollars per year); that is expect to pay an additional month of rent or more every year you live here without anything being improved in your apartment. "We don't do upgrades to occupied units". Over six years my rent went up by over 50%. If I stayed another year it would have been closer to 70%.
- Everything in the apartment is of the lowest possible quality: the outside is kept looking nice, but inside things remain old/deteriorating.
- Service varies from great to bad. One time your issue is dealt with right away with a smile, the next it takes a week to get something sorted out, you can't find anyone who knows about what's going on, and everyone you deal with wants nothing to do with you.
- These apartments are expensive for what you get.

I kept renewing my lease because the apartment works well for me in a few ways, i.e. "the upsides":
- The walls between units are mostly cement so you don't need to worry about neighbor noise (yours or theres) too much. One of my bedroom walls was not cement, bizarrely, though.
- It's near entertainment: there are music venues and a movie theatre nearby.
- There's a nearby grocery store.

The apartments are sort of marketed as if they're "higher end", but they're not any better than your average multi-decade old apartment complex. Even the "completely renovated" apartment I saw was just new counter tops on decades old, beat up cabinets.

Examples of issues I've had:
When I moved in there was a ton of stuff wrong with the place as it hadn't been updated in many years. I had to get various things replaced and they just plain wouldn't fix others. I found garbage in my sink from the previous tenants. The paint on the walls was already cracking the day I moved in. There were cuts and paint splotches in the carpet. The closet doors don't fit the space in the wall so they are bent & kinked. The paint is of such low quality that a wet cloth can wash it off the walls. I had fixtures rusted when I moved in and was promised a replacement that I never got. There was paint splatter on the mirror I had to remove myself. I needed to clean layers of dust out of places. The list goes on but you get the idea.<//text>

I can't believe my experience there today. After scheduling a tour, they just cancelled my tour for no reason and even without telling me in advance. The staff called Joseph was so rude towards me. Besides, after checking the neighborhood, it's messy with lots of homeless around. Highly unrecommended!!!<//Review>

<Review>Currently a resident who feels The Fillmore Center treats their below market rate units poorly. They advertise "all apartments have been renovated" yet ours is still older than my 7 year old dog. Things constantly fall apart, but all maintenance does is fix it temporarily. It's not fair to know the unit next door has new carpet, new appliances, and functioning closets and cabinets, but because my rent is lower, I have to continually request maintenance for repairs. In addition, it's very discouraging to call the office because each time I do, I never get a call back, so it's like my request aren't ever considered.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

During the 6+ months of searching for a car, I have never experienced such kindness and genuine concern while meeting with salesman Aaron Navarro. Within the first few seconds of stepping foot on the lot Aaron paid very close attention to detail to my own personal/financial needs. In the past dealerships have treated me poorly, however, Nissan of Clovis has proved differently. Not only did they spend quality time finding the best deal amongst peers for me, I had a thorough knowledge of information throughout the entire process. At the end of the deal the manager plus a few other staff members congratulated me and expressed how happy they were to help. I can proudly say I am satisfied customer with a new car to show for it! I would definitely recommend Nissan of Clovis to anyone in search of car!!!< /review>

Carlos Garcia & Bobby Finance manager are Awesome!

They are very professional and offered really great customer service.

Over all every one the was very polite and as I was waiting through the process anyone who passed by me while I was waiting stopped to ask if I needed assistance.

Great Customer service! I would recommend to friends & family..< /Review>

I love Nissan in Clovis! The people there are super nice and helpful. The guy Mario that assisted me in getting my car serviced was awesome and made me feel safe and walked me through the whole process. I know nothing about cars so Mario’s patience with me made me feel comfortable to ask him anything. Great job Mario.</Text>

My husband and I had the best experience during the transaction of our new 2020 Pathfinder. We are so pleased with how nice everyone was to us. Thank you for making this an enjoyable experience.

Luis, the finance manager, was so helpful in explaining all the paperwork I signed to buy my pathfinder. He was professional and answered all my questions that my husband and I had. I plan on coming back in the future to buy another car from Clovis Nissan. Great job, Luis.

The salesman that helped us look at our car was also very professional and helpful.<//Text>

We had an excellent experience at Nissan Clovis. Alex Trujillo was very knowledgeable, patient, and personable. He made sure we were we were comfortable and happy with the process. We highly recommend Alex. Roberto Lopes in the finance office made financing the truck almost fun. Great experience! Thank you Alex and Roberto.

Alex was my salesperson and he was very friendly and professional. I appreciated that he did not pressure us into buying a car. He was patient with us and willing to help us out in anyway he could. Thank you Alex for all your help! Lots of cars to choose from. Found my dream car!< /review>

My Husband and I we’re looking for a new family car. We went in, Tsim helped us find multiple options within our budget and was very helpful in giving us pointers for the best option. Every step of the way he was honest, and straightforward! We could not have been happier with the service we received! They have a forever customer out of me! Anyone looking to purchase a vehicle run to Nissan, they will absolutely take very good care of you!!<//review>

Traded in my 2015 Silverado for a used 2019 Honda Accord Sport with 14k miles. Aaron Navarro was able to place me in that car at a great monthly price and Jordan Creamer was my financier who worked with my budget...was able to walk out with full warranty for 100k miles, lifetime oil, nice ride and all under $400 a month. If you want to buy and not be haggled go with Mr Navarro and talk to Mr Jordan in finance!!! Super awesome experience!  Thanks Lithia!< /review>

<Text>Was contacted by them after receiving a Kelly Blue Book instant cash offer for my current car.  Made an appointment and drove out there expecting to meet the person I was communicating with. Was immediately greeted by a salesman which was great. However, he did a half a$$ inspection and seemed totally unaware of how the instant cash offer process worked.  He got with his sales manager(who he said inspected the vehicle but obviously did not) and gave me the typical lowball offer explanation about the dealer needing to put money into it before resale.  Stay away if you’re figuring on any communication between the actual dealer and the Kelly Blue Book rep.  Took it to Haron the next day and everything was amazingly smooth!!<//Text><userid>114821353090754150693< /userid></record></dataset><record>

Was helped very well and given a good price for a used sedan that I needed to get rid of . Julian p was super helpful and answered all my annoying questions with patience and even  addressed/reassured my mother’s concerns without trying to rush us out to just make a sale . Recommended him to my best friend and so far he’s doing an amazing job with her sale as well . 5 starzzzz!</text>

I purchased my second vehicle from Clovis Nissan yesterday. Carlos Garcia was great help. My car shopping experience was not stressful. I already knew what car I was looking for down to the color inside and out. I called Nissan set up an appointment to meet with Carlos. Got there told him what I was looking for he showed me that car I was looking for and done. There was no pressure from Carlos trying to show me other vehicles. Getting pre-approved before car shopping help speed up the process. I was done about 1 1/2 hours start to finish. Thank you Carlos, Brenda and Bobby for all your help. I will recommend everyone I know who is looking for car. Nissan has been the best vehicle I have purchased...Thank You...<//Text>

Been car shopping for a few weeks and I am very lucky I went to lithia vs own a car, ended up getting a better car for less money. Then even have free car fax report on all of their cars. Screw own a car Fresno they’re crooks. If anyone is looking for a new vehicle come here and ask for Tsim Vang he is an excellent sales man and will go the extra mile to make sure you’re fully satisfied with your purchase. Thank you Tsim!</text>

<text>The staff was very friendly, and accommodating.  They made me feel confident I was getting the best deals available at the time of purchase.  5 STARS for Lithia Nissan of Clovis. Zero for Nissan Corporation.

There are two issues NOT related to Lithia Nissan of Clovis (corporate issues):

1.  My personal check was rejected even though there was more than enough to cover the amount.  I was required to get a Cashier's check.  Corporate policy I was told.  I thought of backing out but the staff was so nice (not their fault)

2.  Military discount was denied although I served from 1972 - 1996 (24 years continuous) active duty).</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I LOVE Nissan of Clovis!!! I am so glad I chose to come here for my business! They go above and beyond! Brenda got in contact with me and helped me so much with my car purchase! She is on too of reaching out to you and responding if you have any questions The! The manager Gurdeep is a sweetheart and will do his best to work with you despite any issues you may have. JD and Jerry are awesome too!! They all worked their magic to ensure I got my Brand New 2020 Nissan Rogue. They also offer you so much compared to other dealerships. Extended warranties, bumper to bumper coverage, ETC. CHOOSE NISSAN OF CLOVIS ❤❤❤<//review>

<review>I bought my car on line because of the virus and my "virtual" salesperson was Brenda. She was , starting with a thorough virtual tour of the vehicle and promptly answering any question I may have had and acting as a go between with the sales manager. She was always prompt, thorough and courteous. Aaron was the young man that delivered my car to me and he was great and spent a lot of time showing my husband all of the features of the car, he was very professional yet friendly and knowledgable. I would be happy to do business with them future.< /review>< user_name>

Just purchased a used vehicle not even 1.5 months ago and I am already having issues with it. I went to the dealership 3 times which was a waste (and I drove from Visalia) yet nothing has been done. I was told by the manger that he would contact me and he has not. I put a good amount down for this vehicle and just feel like their giving me the run around. I would recommend finding a dealership that’s honest, they at Lithia Nissan of Clovis clearly are NOT, although they pretend to be concerned.<//Text>

< review>
Where do i start?!!  I literally just bought my house and was given the keys 3 days ago. I loved my 2013 Nissan, but i bought it used from another dealership a few years back and as a result, I didn’t know how well it was maintained. Well the transmission gave out and i was told it would be thousands to replace. So I did what anyone would do, I Called my bank who I’ve been with for over 30 years To ask for a small loan to cover the repairs. Because my existing car loan wasn’t quite paid off, they refused to give me a small loan to repair my car!! I couldn’t believe it, i have good credit, and I’ve never once Been late or missed a Payment on any loan I’ve ever had with them. I was more than a little  upset! I was outraged!! So on a whim i went to Lithia, and explained my situation and asked what i could do. Because i just put thousands down on my house i didn’t have much of anything for a down payment... and i still owed   on a car that wasn’t even running. Omar Diaz and Jorge Lopez worked hard to pay off my existing loan, and get me into a brand new car at a payment I could afford!!! I literally left near tears i was so grateful!!! They even arranged to have my non working car towed so i didn’t have to worry about it any more!!!  Thank you guys... for your patience and diligence to help me out when my own banking institution that I’ve been with for over 30 years refused to!!!  Now that’s service!!!! I’m now the proud owner of a brand new car!!!< /review>

Not sure why it takes almost 2 hours for JUST an oil change.  I would rather not spend a chunk of my day here and sit for this long everytime I need something done that should take 40 minutes to do.  Absolutely ridiculous.</Text>

I want to thank Gabriel and Brenda for their efficient service in assisting me with my new car purchase. They were friendly and professional. They worked with me to get the numbers correct, and even delivered the car and my paperwork to me at my office! They showed me that they wanted my business and they earned it. I love my new Murano and I would definitely work with them again.</review>

Dave Thomas is awesome! He went above and beyond what I expected. I was honestly surprised by how courteous and helpful ALL the staff was, from the "welcome" to the "have a great day" I want to say Thank You for making it such a positive experience. Lately people have been so rude and impatient, it was nice to be treated with so much kindness. I look forward to my next visit.</Text>

Sandy started to help but then gave up midway thru our text conversations( she gave  us contact info for Nissan corporate office rather than deal with us directly) so in reality DID NOT follow up with us regarding our concerns. Fred in the service department was not being completely honest with my family. Julian (Nissan sales rep) was with us on our test drive and confirmed our concerns were valid but yet Clovis Nissan acted as if we didn’t know what we were talking about. Andrew did not follow thru with his word, he said it would “be taken care of”.... guess that means absolutely nothing. A man by the name of Gurdeep (identified himself as the general manager) reached out to us a few days later, and seemed to become upset during the conversation. Clovis Nissan staff were not rude but my experience was not very positive. First time buying a car here and probably the last 😶<//Text>

After going to another place and being let down, I came here, feeling pretty hopeless. I met Carlos on the lot and told him what I was looking for and that I didn’t have much to offer. He found the perfect car for me and helped get me a price I couldn’t pass up. He was very helpful, nice, and patient. I highly recommend coming here if you’re looking to buy new or used.</Text>

<Review>I was told the car came with glass protection and SWAT. The dealership finance guy told me that I would just need to call SWAT co to get it activated. Well when I called SWAT they said only the dealer could activate. The salesman knew this app for tracking and setting speed limits was important I asked by text before I signed to make sure it was included and he said it was but that we wouldn't get the warranty on the items. Since its for my teenage daughter this was an important selling point for me. Not good business practice and very deceiving. I feel I was lied to.</Review>< pictures>

I  came in  with no intention on buying a car. Just came in browsing. After talking to the awesome salesman JD Graham he went over a great deal that was just too good to pass up. Gerry in finance was an awesome guy too he made the end finance process so easy and really understood from a customers point of view which was great for a first time experience. I recommend anyone who is looking to buy to come in and ask for these guys. It really made coming into a big dealer enjoyable. Don't forget to look through their inventory because they have a car for everyone no matter your budget and lets not forget Sandy with their customer service team she was very responsive and was their whenever I had a question before i entered the dealer. All around they have a super team here and I want everyone to experience something like this to make your car buying experience less stressful.<//text>

This was the easiest car buying experience I’ve ever come across. I went in thinking I was going to take a ride down rip off lane, however Vincent Thao and Bobby Lopez in finance made it very simple. Vincent was a great gentleman and Bobby was too. I was in and out in a tad under two hours, and this included test drive, good conversation, and all paperwork. Ask for Vincent if you decide to visit Nissan of Clovis! If you don’t buy, you’ll no doubt have an unforgettable experience. Great job Vincent and Bobby! Both of you were exceptional.</Text>

<review>I want to publicly thank Brenda, Vince, Bobby, and Gurdeep at Lithia Nissan for their outstanding customer service! During a time when many places lack good customer service, it was extremely refreshing to encounter an entire team of professionals who get it!  I would definitely recommend this dealer for your next car purchase!!<//review>< pictures>

Shout out to Luis Wendels from Lithia Nissan of Clovis. I went in today to try and get a car in my budget with not that good credit and a low down payment. He worked with my husband and I really well. He was kind, patient, and humble. I am very grateful and satisfied with Luis's service and the whole Nissan of Clovis. I definitely recommend this place and ask for Luis. I will definitely be going back for our future cars and my kids cars. Thank you. Words can't explain how our family feels!!< /text>

Like others have suggested, I also find all the 5 star reviews to be suspicious. Service from the young salesman was standard. I was willing to buy the car my daughter picked out at their asking price. During the signing I was told  the sales manager will not approve any sale unless I purchased two of their warranties. I had to buy an upholstery warranty and a clear coat warranty for $1000 each in order to purchase a car. I said "no, I just want the car". After the back and forth circus that makes car buying such a chore, I was told "it's up to you if you buy the car or not, the car will sell tomorrow". "My manager wont sell a car unless you buy two warranties". I'm not sure how this can even be legal, but I certainly dont want two overpriced warranties.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>It was 5 stars at first but downgraded to one....less if I could. Been having trouble with the computer in my car. They told me I didn't have a warranty to cover it and said it would cost $800. Called the Nissan in Palm Springs and they said I have a warranty until 100,000 miles with a $50 deductible. It's going on week three and Mike AND Fred were supposed to call and verify this and get back to me about when to get it fixed. Now I am on to my next assignment and will have to go through this again at another Nissan. Will have to buy an Aux cord to connect my phone for music because the Bluetooth don't work in my car.

Oh man, how do I even start. THANK YOU MUCH JULIAN ESTRADA!!!!

Julian Estrada is a gemstone at Lithia Nissan of Clovis. He’s courteous and is way beyond professional. Anyone lucky enough to be his client will have a smooth, interactive, and welcoming atmosphere. He went above and beyond to squeeze in an appointment late in the evening just so my younger brother can do a last minute test drive.

When it came to handling the paperwork, we were done within an hour. Smooth, simple, informative, and COMFORTING. Julian was very patient and all of our questions and concerns were lifted with ease.

The car we were buying was a traded in 2011 Toyota RAV4. It was only on the lot for less than a week! As a result, it needed to be inspected and cleaned. Julian went above and beyond with calls and texts just to keep us updated on everything that was going to be done to the RAV4 while we waited.

After taking the RAV4 home, some more minor problems came up but all of which was taken cared of no questions asked. One of the tires caught a nail and was considered as a wear and tear. That should had came out of our pocket but the tire was swapped out free of charge. Talk about customer’s satisfaction.

Thank you Julian, and thank you Nissan of Clovis.<//text>

Awesome customer service!! I just purchased my Nissan Altima SR 2020 from Nissan Clovis on 6/29/20 and had a great experience. The car salesman, Carlos Campos who assisted me was very attentive and had a lot of patience with me and all the questions I had. The financial person, Gerry was also very helpful and had great communication skills.</Text>

My service provider recommended I get a transmission flush which i just received from this location a few months prior. Was also very unprofessional when I asked to get ones for the vending machines and said he did not have any. Adding he used them alll at the strip club .<//Review>

The Service Managers who helped with my Nissan Service and checked me in was outstanding.  Young guy with glasses and a beard, very nice.  I was handed over to another service manager when my car was ready, but both guys did a great job.  Lithia Nissan of Clovis does a great job every time I go there, so I appreciate the wonderful experience.  I would recommend Lithia Nissan of Clovis to my friends and business associate

On my recent visit November 19th, I had a great experience at Lithia Nissan of Clovis.  They always provide great customer service and the people are friendly.  I drive across town and get my car serviced there because Lithia Nissan of Clovis always exceeds my expectations.  You won't get that type of service is most places.  If you're thinking about getting a new car or having your existing car/truck serviced, please check them out, they're great..!<//text>

So after days even weeks of shopping around for a family vehicle, I landed at Lithia Nissan of Clovis. Not only did they have a crazy good selection, but it was the first time I was not over pressured to purchase a vehicle. I did not have perfect credit going in however the finance department worked their butts off to get me into the vehicle of our families dreams. Our salesman Lewis was so helpful and knowledgeable about almost all the vehicles on the lot. Even though this was our first purchase at Lithia Nissan of Clovis they have definitely gained a customer for life. I will definitely be going back. I highly highly recommend this dealership!!!!<//Text>

I just purchased my vehicle, lets start off by saying sandy was So nice and amazing by helping me with prices before I even got down there because I do live about an hour away,  and I didn’t want to make a trip if I couldn’t find something in my price range, secondly, Vincent helped with all of our questions and helped us pick out the most reliable car, he was super down to earth, we just met him and it seemed like we already knew eachother, he didn’t make us feel pressured into buying anything. These people don’t just want to make a sale but they obviously care about you, a reliable car for you to drive home with, and great prices even with a 3 year warranty, so I really have no worries. I will buy from here again with no doubt in my mind. Thanks for the amazing experience, everywhere else I went, people were rude, rushed me, And if I didn’t seem interested they seem like they were uninterested in helping me. All the staff who helped is so friendly! Thanks again!< /Text>

So 4 days ago i went to own a car .. the service was horrible. The dealer kept trying to push a car on me that i didn’t like. I wanted a sporty car. He was pushing a hybrid. He told me he couldn’t help me . My credit was to bad. I left there telling him I’ll  be back with a Car within a week .
Well here iam. Sitting at Nissan of Clovis with Vincent while they Detail my 2019 Nissan Altima. Let me tell you i will never buy a car from Anyone else . He was amazing. He made the entire process smooth! He was so helpful and hit every angel with 100%. Vincent we’ll be back for our truck! Thank you for being so amazing !! Nissan you Rock!!!< /text>

Thank you Nissan of Clovis for the help in getting into my new 2020 Nissan Sentra SR. I leased my new car and got an amazing deal. Vincent, Julian, and Jorge answered all the questions I had, and there were a lot of them. Being my age, it's hard to understand the technology in todays cars.

<Review>It's a good place to have a service done. Reliable. Friendly people who make you feel comfortable. I enjoy sitting and reading while i wait. Just be careful if they are having a team meeting. They come out pumped up and try to sell you a new car. This one guy wouldn't leave me alone. Even after I moved to a different area!</Review><userid>107723827417629695083<//userid>< pics>

The first day I came in, the sales rep seemed like he truly cared.  I actually thought he did.  I brought my kids in because I had to and they weren’t behaving well and he was kind about it.  They “secured” me financially on a car listed at 13.9k for $405/month for 82 or so months and my husband doing the math said it would be $30k over the course of time.  We turned down the offer, they tried to keep negotiating, but wouldn’t really lower the cost at all.  That was also with $500 down.  That day, I walked away.

Over the next few days, we kept in contact and they tried to keep negotiating.  I was interested in the car.  Multiple times, they kept giving me terrible deals that weren’t any different than the first terms.  I then offered $1200 down and asked about terms.  They said “$395 for 75 months”.  That was also near one of our previous negotiations that I turned down and that was with $200-$500 down.  The sales rep kept blaming “my credit” for the terrible 15% interest terms. And said they were doing their best and perhaps I should take the high payments and “refinance” in the future because I “need a vehicle to build my credit”, sorry... but I have one vehicle already that I’ve paid on time for 3 years.  I don’t need that reason to “build” my credit.

Over the course of the week, the KBB value for that vehicle had dropped $1k and I noticed it.  When he kept saying the terrible terms were my “credit”, and that he’s doing “everything he can to help, but his hands are tied.”  With that response that his “hands are tied” I asked one day what the terms would be like if they dropped the price of the vehicle $1k?  Since, that truly is in their control and could help me terms and situation.  His response?  “I could drop the price of the car $2k and it wouldn’t make a difference!”  I told him to prove it.  He sent me a quote for $365/month and I told him we could do it!  His response? “I’m not going to the price of my vehicle $2k!!  I hope you find what you’re looking for.”   First of all, I didn’t ask for $2k, I asked for $1k.  You exaggerated the price and then pinned it on me?  He truly made it all seem like I was in a “hopeless situation without him” and he was doing “everything in his power to help”, until we discussed money and I asked him to give a little if I was willing to substantially increase my down payment.

I spoke with his supervisor, Sandy.  She told me she’d have a manager follow up.  She sounded concerned.  Zero managers followed up.  Two weeks later?  Text from Sandy: “Hey, we haven’t heard from you in a while!  Are you still in the market for a vehicle?”

Yes, I am, but I’m pretty sure you’ve all lost my business unless you can seriously be a better, less MANIPULATIVE company.  You guys completely play your customers and make them out to be a victim in a “bad situation”, that you are going to “save”.  It is manipulating their emotions to make a sale.  It’s corrupt and I’m not stupid enough to fall for it when I sense something feels wrong.

Customers, beware.  When you sit at their desks and they’re negotiating terms, blaming your credit, not budging on pricing, when playing the good and caring guy, do the math and look at what they’re trying to sell you over time.  You feel pressured?  Don’t fall for it.  Unless it’s your terms and they’re LISTENING to you, walk away and don’t even lose sleep about it.  There are other, better dealerships!<//review>

On top of that their customer service was very good throughout the entire process and gave great advice when needed.

<text>Terrible service. They told me that I needed a new mass airflow sensor, new air filter, new connecting to to the airflow sensor and an update. I took it to a local mechanic and he fixed the tube going into my mass airflow sensor and now everything is fine. The engine light has not come on since. They were trying to charge me 1100 and something dollars for a $40 tube. What a rip off.

We also bought our van at Lithia in Fresno in 2014 and purchased the extended warranty and oil changes for life. They told us we could take our van to any Lithia and get the oil changes done for free. Every time I took my car to Lithia Nissan in Clovis, they said I didn't have the free oil change plan. Then I would tell them to go pull the original contract and have to sit around for an hour while they figured out what the hell was going on. The same thing happened with any repair work regarding the warranty. This went on occurring on and off for the entire......6.......years. They are extremely unorganized and apparently are incapable of notating the account in anyway so the same error continued to occur over and over.

In short they charged an inordinate amount for the repair and getting them to honor their own warranty and oil change plan, that I paid over a thousand dollars for over the term of the loan, was a nightmare. Take your business elsewhere and save yourself the headache.

Also, The last time my wife took the car in to get it serviced I told them to not run a diagnostic unless they knew our warranty was still valid. You see I had already taken the shop in and found out that it needed a new hose to the mass airflow sensor. I even called the dealership and told them not to charge her or look at it if our warranty wasn't still in effect. So of course they booked her in and charged her $160 for a diagnostic that I didn't need. When I called in to complain they refused to refund the charge. They are an absolute cluster. I feel like someone has robbed me today.<//text>< name>

I just purchased a vehicle today and it was a smooth experience. Personally, I dread making large purchases that lock you into a contract for years. Thanks to Omar he was able to explain everything clearly and gave me what asked for. He didn't push any extras on me, just gave me what I asked for. Yes, their vehicles come with Lo Jack and Glass Coat but they were transparent with me about those included fees. We negotiated a deal that I found to be more than reasonable. These guys WILL meet you in middle.

Vincent posses exceptional politeness and was great to work with as well when it came time to sign the paperwork. New or used vehicle, I highly recommend these two dudes.<//review>

<Review>Suspicious 5 star reviews... I strongly suggest you do your research and get pre approved prior to coming here. They played the game added all these hidden unnecessary fees and our payment for the same term kept fluctuating for no particular reason. Be very cautious and if it’s your first time buying a vehicle go with someone who knows the game. On a side note, Omar is a terrible salesman. It felt like working with a 13 year old. He has such an arrogant attitude. He was acting nice until we decided to sleep on it and his character turned a 180.< /Review><Name>MC<//Name>< rate>

We worked with Juan we explained we had been approved for financing with EECU.  Juan continued to gather information, several times I explained we had been approved and we did not want an additional credit report. Having additional credit reports can lower your credit score which can cost you money. Enter Jordan we explained the same to Jordan we had been approved with EECU and NO ONE HAS BETTER Rates.  We when to lunch and were going to return, but guess what we learned we had a new credit report request....would you do business with people who do this??????<//Text>

I recently purchased a vehicle from Lithia and I couldn't be happier.  The customer service I experienced couldn't have been better.  The first guy (I forgot his name, Mexican guy) was awesome.  The other guy was Vincent.  He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  I felt very comfortable with him and felt like he would take care of me.  I'm overall very satisfied and would buy from here again!<//Text>

So there i was going dealership to dealership trying to find the perfect car. No luck. Then i decided to come here. Man am i glad i did. First thing is first, this handsome gentleman name Omar greeted me right away. Such a firm man handshake and beautiful smile. Never seen such white teeth before. Anyways after that he went ahead and actually listened to wat i was looking for. He made me feel special and wanted. He made me feel important. Even more than my own girl. Incredible man. Chivalry is not dead ladies. And that man is prove of that. Anyways i suggest coming here and doing business with Omar. One of the greatest experiences i have ever had. Thanks Omar😊<//text>

Bought a car in June 2019, engine blew without warning March 2020. I got an oil change from them in December and the oil dried out, no warning lights or anything. Called the dealership to see what they could do and they say it's out of their hands. Really disappointed in what is supposed to be a reputable dealership. I will never do business here again and I will always tell people looking for a dependable car to look elsewhere.<//Review>

Hi! Gary and I both thought that the salesman, Luis , was very knowledgeable and helpful in finding us a car that was  perfect for us. I liked it that he didn’t make us feel that he was impatient with us....it was a very hot day and he was busy bringing us cars to look at and try. Luis was friendly which put me at ease when asking car questions. We’ve had a Nissan several years ago and really liked it. Luis made our car searching and buying experience good one. Which means that we’ll be back! A thanks also to the fine and professional Financial Manager , Jorge. He helped make the paper signing process an enjoyable one. Everyone we met there were trying their best and we appreciated that!< /Review>

< Review>
Fred rocked it again. All pricing was given to me up front for the assumed service that was to be performed. I was already aware of what my total bill was estimated to be prior to anything being done. Even better, some of the services actually didn’t need to be done, and therefore lowered the bill. This was surprising for me to hear instead of the department doing the services anyway (with no notice to me) to get the extra money. Puts a lot of faith and trust back into Clovis Nissan.</Review>

Staff gave me different stories. Very confusing and felt very suspicious about prices. When questioned, they got defensive and accused me of calling them liars. The car is great but the staff is questionable.</text>

Amazing experience! Went to the dealership not confident in finding something within my budget and left with a brand new car!

I have been looking for the right car for me for  quite some time now. I recently stopped by to check out some cars and right when I thought there wasn’t anything for me here Joshua Medina approached me and man did he sure know his stuff! I was so glad he approached me because I think I found the car that I have been looking for all because of him. He is probably one of the best car salesman I have encountered so far and I have been going around looking for a car for a while but I believe he is the best! I guarantee you this, I will be back to get my car.< /Review>

<Review>I recently had the pleasure of assisting my niece purchase her first vehicle, Nissan of Clovis gave us the best assistance possible. We were extremely pleased and happy because all of their employees assisted us in the best way they could. They were polite, professional, and down to earth. They also made sure any vehicle we were interested in was the best fit and at the lowest possible rate. The entire time we were there they made sure we were comfortable and did not need anything. They even have an area for the kids to wait which is very comfortable for them with their WiFi and expresso machine. The person who assisted us was named Gabriel, and he was the perfect person to assist us. He made sure to let us view and test drive all vehicles we were interested in. He made us feel very happy and totally satisfied with our great  purchase. Thank you Nissan of Clovis for making this first time buyer very satisfied and extremely happy purchasing a vehicle from you. Thank u so much!!!!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

< Review>
Bought a 2020 Rogue from Nissan of Clovis on 3-8-20. I had high expectations considering that I've purchased 4 other new vehicles from this location. Needless to say, my previous loyalty netted me nothing.

I was nickel and dimed by finance. Paperwork for my trade in wasn't completed properly because the staff wanted to go home. I now have to take time out of my day to go back in to sign additional paperwork.

My purchasing experience felt rushed and awful. After this experience I will never purchase from Lithia Nissan again.</Review>

I had a great experience buying a used Rogue here a couple of weeks ago.

We were very happy that Lithia Nissan of Clovis was willing to negotiate with us on the car we wanted whereas another dealership in the area was not. What first impressed me though was the knowledge the sales associate, Gabriel, had of the line of cars of which we were interested. At the other dealership when I asked questions about the car the answers given were guesses or assumptions by the sales associate not the facts. Few sales associates in any industry rarely know the products they sell so I greatly appreciated that Gabriel did. He was also very polite and pleasant and didn't pressure us with hard core sales tactics which turns us off and will cause us to walk away. The manager, Vincent, who negotiated the contract, was very professional, friendly and easy with which to work. The much appreciated hospitality he showed us was unexpected and "above and beyond" type customer service. Once a price was agreed upon we then met with the finance specialist, Bobby. Despite it being very late at night Bobby was very friendly and pleasurable making doing unpleasant paperwork actually a nice experience. You could tell everyone there worked together as team which made our experience easier as I didn't want to be buying a new car in the 1st place but had to because I'd wrecked my car that I'd loved driving and was still in pain from the accident< /review>

Never had an issue with the service at Clovis Nissan. Until someone stole an ITEM from my car. We call they first say they didn’t see, then had to wait until the next day to see if the technician seen it. Then the story changes saying they never seen it. I would recommend that you take pictures of your inside of your vehicle as they take pictures of your car.<//Review>

<Review>We were looking for a vehicle and we went to look at their selection and their salesman, Gabriel Vasquez, helped us out and that night we drove off with our vehicle!  The Clovis Nissan team was great and they were able to get us into a vehicle that was exactly in the price range we had in mind.  Definitely recommend them!< /Review>< username>

I am from out of town. I had car troubles on the way here. I took the car to get the transmission serviced while I was here. When I dropped the car off they told me that I had to leave the car overnight which I understand that it might be busy time of the season. With no way of getting back to hotel, we asked for a shuttle. we waited about 30 minutes a no shuttle showed up. I called my son to pick us up which he lives completely across town. After he picked us up and got to hotel, I received a call from you that my car was ready! Why did service writer lie to me about the length of time my car was going to be there? I could have waited there are not have gone through all the hassle of finding a ride.  I don't like being lied to.</Text>

< Review>
I have a problem with my transmission - a problem that Nissan is well aware of because the issue is in the courts.  However  they still want me to pay $1300 to get it fixed ( even though they will reimburse me if the court case clears)  but I can not afford the $1300 so here I am stuck with a car that is starting to fail that any other make of car this problem would not even be an issue. Then they charged me $160 to tell me the problem that I had  but that I already knew and told them what I thought it was.<//Review>

<Review>This review is a success story of an initially not-as-great experience selling my used car that was totally turned around by some really great customer service from the folks at Lithia Nissan, especially Gurdeep Randhawa. Five star service all around.

My old car was on its last legs, and so I used Kelley Blue Book's "Instant Cash Offer" option to see what I might get. Almost immediately after completing that process Sandy Her got in touch with me. She informed me of a price range that I could expect to receive for my car and instructed me to bring the car in to be viewed in person before I would get a final quote for the vehicle. The communication from Sandy was great. She even e-mailed me on a day she had off work. Great service!

When I first brought the car in be looked it, I was quoted the lowest end of the range that I had initially received based on nothing that was actually seen on the car. For a few other reasons, I had some concerns about this interaction and left an initial review that was not very flattering. It was at this point, that I was especially impressed with how my concerns were addressed. Within hours of posting the review, I received a phone call from Gurdeep to follow up with the review. The responsiveness that he demonstrated was incredibly impressive. I reiterated some of my concerns, and I was pleased that rather than try to minimize those concerns, Gurdeep acknowledged some areas for improvement (even indicating changes that were already being made at the dealership to address my concerns). He also expressed a strong commitment to ensuring that my experience could be turned into a positive one. He remained communicative with me, even texting me on a weekend day that he had off work to make sure that I was comfortable with a revised offer for my car.

When I returned to the dealership to try again, the team was actually able to give me an offer 20% above even the highest end of the range I had initially been told without me even requesting it. I was treated with courtesy, respect, and compassion.

I want to reiterate that this interaction had to do with ME selling THEM a used car. They really had just about nothing to gain from this interaction. Nonetheless, the level of care and high quality customer service that they provided in this interaction assured me that if the roles were reversed and I was buying a car, they would be a fantastic team with whom to work. Many thanks to Sandy, Gurdeep, Vincent, and Earl for the great work here!< /Review>< gmap_id>

This was the best customer service I have ever received , I was treated so well the 3 hours I was here and everyone was very patient with me. They were very attentive and tried to make the best deals for me. They even bought us some pizza while we were waiting. Jordan and Julian are the best ! They attended me throughout the whole process , I am now leaving with an amazing brand new car and a great experience! I can’t wait to come back !</review>

I came here as a first time car buyer with a good down payment and was clearly taken advantage of. Now I’m stuck with an overpriced car for over half a decade. I wouldn’t come here again and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. They swindled me at every turn, especially Jesus Rodriguez. I’ve warned everyone I know to stay away from this business.</text>

Please read my review of Lithia on Yelp. In a nutshell, as you will see when reading yelp reviews, this place is shady in what appears to be all areas of the process of buying a car. My experience was with Eric the sales person and Jordan the sales manager/assistant manager- not sure what he does other than lie and misrepresent information. My advice, shadiest place I have ever attempted to purchase a car. Just do yourself a favor and look around. Unless you are trained on all of the ins and outs of how they hide and manipulate numbers and hide things in the contracts that cost you extra- do not attempt to outsmart them- they seem to be professional scammers.<//Text>

Better service area would be great. Went in for an oil change and wasn't "scheduled for appointment had to show email confirmation. Was charged for tire rotation although it wasn't completed. Was given all green on inspection, although windshield wipers need to be replaced. Makes me question the quality of service be given all the way around. I will only return due to the fact I have lifetime oil change program.</Text>

Not happy with this place. The staff was very friendly, but this is a Bait & Switch dealer. I came to view a car 3 times, discussed the price multiple times, and finally ready to sign. Except then they tell you that the LoJack that is "included" on all their cars, is actually a required mark up - $1300, ON ALL CARS. So whatever the good deal is that you work out, is instantly gone, and after a cumulative 4 hours here, discussing the car and pricing, and then to only tell me that its required right at the end, Nope.< /review>

So I went to lithia of Clovis to find a car and I met Erik P. He was so kind, and understanding and eventhough I didnt get the car I wanted, he kept me posted on other cars. He called me today with a car that came in the lot and it was barely 9am, i went in to look at and I ended purchasing it. So if you need to purchase a car stop by lithia of Clovis first and ask for Erik P, and I promise you wont be disappointed.<//Text>

Great prompt oil change. However, many mechanical issues AFTER being serviced that never existed on previous Altima. Rough starts, NO STARTS, within a week of service, car won't even turn over. Follow up: they overtightened the battery straps and cracked the battery. Took back and replaced.<//review>

We purchased our first Nissan from Gabriel Vazquez - what a great guy!  I forgot to pickup my cars manual for ever and he saved it for me until I went in for service - many months later. Everyone there's super friendly, big thanks to Latoya and whomever washed my car today after service!</Review>

Everyone here was extremely nice and even more helpful. We were able to get what we wanted and what we were looking for. The process was quick and easy. This was my first time here and our salesman Felipe helped us out a lot. I asked a lot of questions and he had answers for all of them. Felipe was very polite and professional. Definitely would recommend anyone looking for a new car go to Lithia Nissan of Clovis and ask for Felipe. I love my new car.< /review>

We found online "starter car" for our 18 year old and went in the business. The car was advertised by the seller as having the price dropped from almost $7000 to $4995, and that is sold "As Is". Same was specified clear on the car, along with the car specifications. After the test drive we went it to buy it, intending to pay cash. Jordan Creamer, the Assistant Sales Manager, started the process when we found that we have to pay for LoJack and for Glasscoat, all for almost $1000 extra. We told Mr. Creamer that we did not need these improvements, nor we asked for them. Also, they were nowhere advertised, so the business is now in violation of the "false advertisement" policy. Mr. Creamer said that he will try to see what he can do about it and left us to wait for about 30 minutes. He came back and said that he is sorry but the car was sold to a different customer that "beat our price". Useless to say that no new customers entered the business while we sat inside waiting for him. He offered to show us a different car in our price range, and after waiting another 20 minutes he showed us a "clunker", a car with all chipped paint and a big sticker on the windshield saying "Not for sale".
We will report the dealership to Lithia company, while they are carrying the name while being involved and very shady business.
Please avoid at all costs this dealership, an also please read other recent reviews. Several are relating similar experiences with the same employee.
Hopefully the management will do something about it.<//review>

We went there to get a used 2008 Chevy Tahoe with 175,000 miles We went in there with the expectation of getting this vehicle for my wife and kids I was told over the phone by Jordan that it was 99% sure that I will get the truck granted my wife’s credit wasn’t perfect and had two small flaws on there and it took them literally about one minute to run her credit and come back and tell us no to our faces it was not a pleasant experience after they had told us they were 99% sure that we would walk away with that truck we were also told that their specialty was financing really the only specialty I feltWas embarrassment because Hoping somebody doesn’t take a matter of minutes it takes a long time I was deeply ashamed to have wasted my time here thank you for your help and embarrassment you caused me Nissan Lithia of Clovis< /Review>

Super friendly staff Johnny Muoa was very nice and friendly and so was the rest of the staff that helped me with the process. After going to different dealerships and dealing with very pushy staff who offered me what THEY thought I should buy, I was over the whole car shopping experience. I am glad I car to this dealership and encountered such wonderful friendly people. I finally got the car that not only I needed but wanted but got a good experience out of it.</Review>

<review>I was shopping for a good used SUV through my BofA app as the condition of my loan through BofA was that I purchase from a partner car dealer. I found the SUV I wanted and contacted the dealership to confirm it was available. They said it was available but the price was $10,999 and not $9,999 as listed online. Rigo, the professed online sales manager said it was listed at $9,999 prior to shop work. But Brenda from online sales indicated the car hadn't been worked on yet. I asked them to honor their online price but refused. This is the kind of predatory activities that undermine the credibility of the auto sales. I've purchased from Lithia before and never had such a shady experience. Good luck guys. I'm not buying from you anymore.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1578331037580, 'text': 'Your feedback is vital to us so that we may review and optimize the processes we have in place.

Wish I could write a good review but the people at Clovis Nissan are dishonest. Buyer be warned, the lojack $999 and Glasscoat $999 are NOT included in your cars total but you WILL be charged for them. Wasted 2 days at the dealership trying to figure out their backwards system of telling you one price only to learn that its always $2000 more at checkout.<//Review>

<text>The service advisor T Bowden was extremely rude when I asked why do I need to email him the coupon that was Presently on their dealership’s website And was told “this is how it is” and he won’t give me the special price on oil change if he does not receive it in his email. I don’t know if he is like this to everybody or he is just frustrated to work.

Poor integrity. Wasted several hours and multiple visits for same vehicle only to find out they use the “bait and switch” tactic. After discussing the price in multiple discussions, when finally at the desk, they insist on a mandatory additional $1300 mark up for the “lo-jack” anti-theft device they add to the vehicle. Nowhere on the advertised price, details of the ad, or in the discussion on price do they tell you that you must add another $1300 to their advertised price. Won’t return, won’t recommend. BEWARE of this auto sales establishment!!</Text>

Had to down grade my original rating.

Today we took the Leaf in for a recall & annual charging system test & the service adviser was completely rude & unhelpful.

Then I spent the most of the morning trying to get the information the adviser was rude &  unhelpful with, which proved unsuccessful because the people who were available to answer the question gave us incorrect information & the people who were supposed to know wouldn't answer the phone.  I left one VM & was transferred to THREE different managers who I was told were actually at their desk but didn't answer the phone.

God willing this will be the last time I need to interact with this place because this is the last year of our lease.  Obviously, I won't be looking to lease or buy again from this or any other Lithia dealership.< /Review>

<username>Allison Silipigni</username><date>1565307934910</date><Rating>5<//Rating><text>My boyfriend and I came in just to look but still had a budget in mind. Nou was fantastic at giving us information as far as if a new or used car would be best. The first car he put us in my boyfriend fell in love with. We came with the expectation of just grabbing a number and coming back. Nou and his manager Edgar ended up working late with us to really find something that worked with the budget we had. We really appreciate all of the patience and hard work that was put in to help us get into this car. The customer service was really amazing. And everyone worked together as well which was a major plus.

And of course we are just really excited to take home a new car. Clovis Nissan gave us a great experience so if you're out and about looking for something, here would be great place to come.</text>< pictures>

Warning: They will try to pull every dirty trick in the book.  Count on it.  We negotiated a price we thought was fair.  When doing the final paperwork, my wonderful, sharp-eyed wife caught a hidden fee for some shady anti-theft insurance we hadn't agreed to.  $1500!  The manager was NOT happy we discovered his trick.

I don't know the drivers name, but he was amazing. I don't know if it's a strange thing to comment on, but the entire drive was so smooth. They also got the car out before the next working day which meant a lot to me because I work out of town a lot. Definitely a lot better service than the last dealership we dealt with. Also, Latoya is super friendly and such an upbeat person. All around a friendly environment.<//Text>

I'm used to the pressure and cons but this place was next level...  Tons of extra "options" that they add to every vehicle, lowjack and glasscoat are added by default and you have to pay thousands more.  The finance department wouldn't let me leave until I added gap coverage even though I kept denying it.  The final hook was that they could drop the interest rate 2 points.  Not sure if they had that leverage why they didn't offer it up front....

Felipe and Andrew were really fantastic human beings to intersect with. Felipe was particularly relatable and good-spirited while we negotiated a car and sale and so many changes I made in my decisions during that process. I enjoyed the really human side of him that he shared at several moments in our exchange. Andrew lightened the load of the paperwork-signing process by being approachable and communicative and just all over fun as a person. I put Andrew through a lot of work during the paperwork process and he never once complained or protested or indicated that he was inconvenienced. Retrospectively I look at the process and realize that I was especially fortunate to have those two specific people assist me in this car-purchasing process.</text>

<Text>I initially started with Carlos, who did a great job in showing my cars and answering questions, when on a whim stopped by one evening. I went back later but due to my schedule and timing I ended up finalizing the deal with Filipe, who made the process as easy as possible, and we talked about all sorts of things while we waited for the car to be ready. Lee who was the last person I spoke with helped me with the final steps and was equally easy to get along with. Over all everyone here that I have come in contact  with has been great so far and been helpful. I look forward to continuing here.< /Text>< pics>

I am more and more dissatisfied with this dealership every time I am in contact with them. I took my car in for a diagnostic in March and received the worst service possible from Latoya in the service department. The customer service was absolutely horrible. When asking simple questions I was rudely interrupted every time. I don't think that I was even able to complete a sentence. After asking to speak to a manager several times and leaving voice messages, I never received a call back. I then had to call back the Clovis Nissan today to get a copy of paperwork from March. ((I did not have the service needed done at this Nissan simply because of how disappointed I was by Latoya)). When asking if I could obtain the paperwork from that service, I was told that she did not have time to it and that I would have to wait. I would have been fine with this, if she weren't so rude and inconsiderate about it. I then asked Latoya if there was anything else that I needed to write down to make it easier for her to pull up my information, in case the email didn't go through. She proceeded to laugh at me. This was so degrading to hear from a customer service representative. Simply because of this young lady, I will not be returning to this Nissan & will make sure that all of my friends/family & anyone looking to buy/sale etc. will not go to this dealership. I have never been treated with so much disrespect.<//Text>

<Review>The entire staff at Lithia Nissan if Clovis was very professional through the entire process. Our sales representative Ron was refreshingly non-pressure. He was patient, informative, thorough and courteous. The finance manager Ger was detailed, professional and friendly. I highly recommend to anyone considering a new vehicle to make sure and give these folks a visit. It will be well worth your time.< /Review>< gmapID>

He and the staff went above and beyond to try to make me happy and find the SUV that was right for me. I know i might have been a pain but i am amazed at how nice and patient they were with me it really made me feel good and relaxed. Brad was so so nice and always looking out for my best interest.

Have the service tech not keep the customer waiting in the waiting room for an 1.5 hrs when the car was ready and parked.  Don't tell the customer after the vehicle is done that they need an air filter and to come back for that.  Show the customer where the waiting lobby is .  Tell the customer that the sensor light will turn off after you drive the vehicle for a few minutes instead of saying you will have to bring the car in for service to diagnose the problem.  When you schedule an appointment with the appraiser at the same time,  the appraiser should be coming to meet you in the lobby and not blow you off and not even call you to let you know and just not show to your appointment.< /review>

Went in unsure of what I wanted because I've been looking for a car for about 6 months maybe more. Vincent is a product specialist at this location and he helped me with all the questions and concerns that I had regarding the vehicles that I looked at and test drove (there was quite a few). He is very knowledgeable and did an awesome job to make sure I felt comfortable with my car buying experience and I left with a car that I totally love!< /review>

The overall experience was pleasant and quick. The manager and salesperson were attentive and  direct. I have worked with Clovis Nissan for the past three years and returned again to purchase my latest vehicle. Traveled five hours to Nissan Clovis and worth the time. My only concern was that I was offered a 500.00 incentive to purchase my lease via letter correspondence. However, the company did not honor the incentive. They, did, however, work with my situation with some flexibility.</text>

Clovis Nissan: outstanding customer service, honest and friendly environment. My wife and I was referred to the this dealer from a close friend we live three hours from Clovis but took the chance and drove there to look at vehicles. We left home with a new suv which my wife loves and left with great feelings towards Clovis Nissan and there staff . We were treated very well and the staff made car shopping enjoyable. Overall highly recommend Clovis Nissan great people great deals</Text>

I’ve recently only owned Toyota’s so when I went into Nissan of Clovis I was only going to look around and see what was being offered. I had the pleasure of meeting a young man named Vincent Thao who definitely made my experience great. I told him what I was looking for and was able to find something I would consider. The moment I seen the car I was in awe. Got in to test drive and Vincent explained all the features as we drove. I thought to myself this is the one. So that was it we started the process and every person that I encountered at the dealership I had a great experience with. I would definitely refer family and friends in the future 💜<//Review>

<text>The dealership did not have my second keys. Instead of admitting that. They had my husband check off the keys even though he was not on the car owner documents. He had just got of transplant surgery and shouldn’t be signing anything. Order my keys and don’t lie about me having them. I only saw 1 pair on the sales desk.

This was my first visit for service after moving to this city. The scheduling staff is the first person to give good service. She is very friendly and helpful. Service could use a little more professional curiosity. When system are down, not to dispute customers understanding of their own contract.< /text>

Very happy with my 2017 Rogue! Jose, Andrew, and Gerry took great care of me. They actually made buying a new car fun and exciting, which is how it should be!

We bought my son a car here last weekend and I just needed to stop in and give our salesman Erik a review. From the moment we walked on the lot he was there to greet us and help us from start to finish! We had just come from Honda North down the street and couldn’t get anyone to help us which was extremely disappointing. Erik was a breath of fresh air as far as sales guys go, we really enjoyed working with him! There were a few things about the transaction that I found frustrating but Erik wasn’t one of them! He really went above and beyond for us. I was pleasantly surprised to get a call from him the following week day to check in and just make sure we were happy with our purchase and ask if there was anything he could do for us. Thanks again, Erik!</Text>

Very family friendly oriented dealership. Shout out to Gabriel for introducing me to the dealership. He is the reason I felt the most comfortable to come back to make my final decision. Jose was also very friendly as well with great management to work around my needs on a preowned vehicle. "As long as the wife is happy, everyone is happy." Thank you guys< /Review>

Bought a 2019 sentra sepecial edition. When we bought the car we had a great experience. Went above and beyond to help it was great. Then not even a month in began having issues with the car. We took it in to service and nothing but problem after problem. The service center so ridiculous and unaware on what is going on around them. I would never recommend this place to even my worse enemy.< /Text>

NV200 Van. Nissan tries harder to get a larger presence in this corner of the market. The 5 yr, 50k mile warranty is compelling. The bonus partition and shelving is a plus. Like all others, I wish my trade in was worth more,  but its OK. Mike Ohrin in fleet sales is a real asset to the company. Recommended!< /Review>

I had been in search of a slightly used vehicle for my mother in law for a few months ,so i live in Bakersfield but travel between san diego and Sacramento for work, during the time i was looking i must have went to a total 10 different dealership between both cities and never did i encounter such awesome sales representative as Omar he took the time to ask me questions on the needs/use of the vehicle i was looking for, as well as to even have knowledge of the vehicles he showed me (which is something i noticed at dealers isnt common which is odd lol)..well i test drove 3 different cars and was stuck between 2 choices with a 3000 dollar difference. He helped me settle on the cheaper of the 2. Which goes to show you it isnt just about money. After a couple weeks of my purchase   he even followed up with me asking how we were emjoying the new car and to feel free to call him if anything ever arised..with that said thanks again Omar< /Text>

<text>Had an amazing experience this last weekend with Vincent. Some close friends of mine wanted to just go look at cars for some options, not expecting to buy, and then Vincent came over. He was not only patient and very informative, but he answered all of our questions and concerns explaining in ways we would understand. He was extremely thorough and tried to show us exactly what we were looking for concerning not only the car but the payment plans as well.

We ended up leaving the lot with a new Nissan Rogue, which if anything, just shows how great he was. If you are looking for someone who actually cares about the customer, and is not the stereotypical "Sleazy car sales man" we would 100% recommend to search out for him there!< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

I just recently purchased my first car here! Anthony approached my family and I when we stopped on by. He was very polite and didn’t push me to buy anything that I didn’t want. The only issue that I had was with my SWAT security that came with my car. I never received an email with my username and password. LUCKILY, Anthony was very helpful and helped me figure everything out.

If you’re looking for a great experience when purchasing your car, I would definitely give Lithia Nissan a chance.< /text>

I interacted with many people to purchase one car; streamlining the process and eliminating at least three of those people would easily lower the cost of their vehicles. I don't need to shake random peoples hands so they feel their job is satisfied. Speaking of price, expect to spend $2k more than sticker automatically as "all Lithia vehicles have glasscoat and lowjack installed" at a premium of $1000 each that cannot be waived. If I could write three reviews for the three main people I encountered, I would, but I'll attempt to do it in one. I will start with the best employee I had, Gabriel. He met me at the door, knew exactly which car I came to look at and was very personable. He was not pushy, was informative and generally a nice guy. If I said no to an option, he didnt try to push. He gets 5+stars. Next is the guy that did paperwork, I believe his name was Robert. Again, personable and was knowledgeable. He presented some options in a way that financially made sense to me. He gets 4stars as he seemed a little unprepared. Lastly is Vincent. He tried to act personable but one could tell he has no clue; he will insult anyone's intelligence first chance he gets. Does he know I have a MBA? Probably not. Should he? Not necessarily but he should treat people like they are not stupid; he tried to tell me that buying a car (liability) at x price and after all the payments would equal x+premiums+fees+finance charges is the same as buying a house (asset). I had to stop him there. If he has a degree, he needs to take econ again to learn the difference between an asset and a liability. If he doesnt have a business related degree, then why is he a finance manager. I am 100% sure a private use vehicles interest is not tax deductible as are mortgage interest payments. He gets -0stars.

As far as Lithia is concerned, this rating is null because I still bought a vehicle. I hope, though,  they can fix the one major issue I had explained above to meet the professionalism as the rest of the team I ran into and earn more overall stars. This rating is more of a "buyer beware" as you have to buy two premium options whether you want them or not. I bought the vehicle solely because of the low miles (18k) and fair price according to cargurus that essentially negated the two mandatory premiums.<//text>

Great people (Ron, Gerry, Andrew and one more guy make this place the spot to get a brand new or used car an experience to remember and never regret. This is my second new car I’ve purchased from them in the past 2 years and I’ll keep going back as long as they’re there.

Obviously this place isn’t perfect, but that’s 99% on your part (your credit score, income, down payment or not Etc). Otherwise these guys will do whatever it takes to help you into a car, not get you into one; help you get into one. So you don’t leave with a massive payment that pays more into the interest than the car itself.<//review>

They engage in deceptive and fraudulent pricing practices. They added on thousands in additions that the customer explicitly declined, and said customer didn't even receive the additions, despite being charged for them. A $15,000 vehicle ended up costing nearly $21,000, and the additional fees were not itemized or listed in the paperwork. Stay away from this dealership. Legal action is currently being pursued against them.< /Text>

Everyone from  (Nissan of Clovis) were amazing. As a single mother, and going back to school I needed a reliable, and affordable vehicle. They were supported and worked with my situation. Thank you, for your service:))<//review>

I came into Lithia with a lot of hesitation. I was greeted by Vincent Thao and he helped me through the whole process. Low pressure, great conversation, amazing product knowledge. He was able to get me a price that met my needs in a car much nicer than what I came in for.  The whole process was seamless and negotiations were minimal. They clearly put my happiness over profit. Vincent even called the next day to make sure I understood all the buttons on my Rogue SV. There are a lot! I came in for a base model and left with the showroom model!<//Text>

First off my battery was defective, so not super impressed that a 2 year old car had to be brought in on warranty. This caused me to be late for work and cost me pay and transportation to and from work for three days. Which to me defeats the purpose of buying something brand new as it is supposed to be dependable. Also the employee I dealt with upon dropping off my vehicle  I was not impressed with. He ordered me a Lyft and told me to stand out front and provided no other information other than they will arrive in 4 minutes and they booked the ride. A Lyft driver pulled up and picked me up. Enroute to my residence the driver realized he picked up the wrong person. I then paid the driver cash for what should have been a free ride. When I returned the same man was rude, gave me an attitude, and a lecture on how it was my fault that I got into the wrong car. What should have occured was the employee should have told me that I was sent a text message with the name of the driver and the car make and model so I would have known what to look for. You should apprise your customers off this information when the service is booked. As my phone was on silent I had no idea until I arrived home. Also considering it is the company's warranty and their defective battery they should be offering a free return ride, shuttle pick up, or drop off of vehicle. I am not pleased with the customer service and I now wish I would have stuck to buying Toyota's. I won't be back to your dealership for anything that I have to pay for out of pocket.< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Would have given them a ZERO star. Got a 2018 used Honda Civic for my 19 yr old. Salesperson Carlos did not reveal the fact that LoJack and oil plans were add-ons and did not go over the cost. He kept saying financial manager will go over it. When we got to Ger the financial manager he was like Carlos didn’t explian the numbers? They acted like it was the other person’s job to go over the numbers with us. Luckily my husband noticed our loan amount didn’t add up and requested to see where the other 2k came from. Ger told us that all their cars comes with LoJack already installed so we will have to pay for it and that the oil plan is also mandatory. Few days after I took my loan papers into my bank I noticed there was an option to opt out of both LoJack and oil plan. Had to call Ger to cancel the add-ons but was only able to cancel the oil plan couldn’t take out the cost of LoJack. Don’t get trap like us, go elsewhere! I usually go easy on ratings but this time this place really crossed the line. Don’t know how these people live with their jobs. Have always shopped at Toyota with no problem, this will be our first and last time with Lithia Nissan of Clovis!<//Review>< Pics>

Update: 2/25

I spoke with Rigo. Response I received was even more upsetting. Was told they won’t honor their online pricing or the E-price of used vehicle I was looking to purchase. Was told they will give me a free tank of gas for hours of inconvenience. That’s a nice way of sending me on my way. As a company you should stand behind your advertisements and not use that as a way to deceive customers into coming into your business.

I went into dealership yesterday ready to buy a used vehicle. I found the vehicle I liked on the website and requested to see and test drive. I went through the paperwork to get purchase order for vehicle after spending an hour at dealership assistant manager Mitch gill tells me that he cannot sell me the vehicle at the price listed online. Told me that there marketing team made a mistake and that they would not honor online price. He suggested the higher asking price would not make a big difference in my monthly payment. I told him I made the drive to Clovis expecting to pay price of vehicle listed online plus associated fees and sales tax. He told me they would not do anything to honor there online price. Very disappointed by service I received. They lured me in with online price and wouldn’t honor for purchase. I did snap photos of listed price online and plan to file complaints with better business bureau for bait and switch practices.<//text>

We went there, got the run around with the payment price. Finally signed paperwork and droves home with the car. Had a call back from the dealer saying they had good news and bad. They wanted us back in at the dealer to sign the last paper. Me and my husband went in and was told only BAD NEWS!!! They jack up the payment price so high and still expect us to be okay with it.

We just bought our passenger van from lithia of Clovis. Vincent Thao was the sales guy who helped us. He was such a great help, very knowledgeable, didn’t pressure us at all. Super nice and friendly. We were greeted right away when we first arrived. Every one was so kind there. If you are shopping around for your next car, make sure to ask for Vincent, you won’t be disappointed.< /review>

Everything was wonderful! Andrew was helping me out majority of the time, but I also had a few others who were always willing to help out or answer any questions I had (Robert, Jordan, Jesus)
I truly feel I got the best deal I could possibly get, with the best service! A++++
Highly recommend to others!
I already referred a friend who just bought a new car there as well!
Thank you Nissan of Clovis!< /review>

<Time>1551212666151< /Time><text>This company is engaged in a scam. They contacted me after i provided information into the KBB system about selling my truck. They made me an offer of 10,200 to 13,000+ depending on confirmation of information I placed on KBB. The purchasing agent viewed the truck and then said her manager would drive it to confirm it drives ok. He did not drive but instead began to talk me into that my truck is not work what i am asking for it. I informed him of the offer. He wanted to argue about whether there was an offer or not. I then talked to his supervisor and after he eventually admitted that in fact I was made an offer. He was unwilling to do anything about it. I bet i am not the first person to come across this issue with them. Hopefully nobody was taken advantage of with promise to buy at one price and the considerably drop the price when you show up. I drove 45 miles to get the dealership and spent over three hours of my time. I would have given them no stars but it would not let me. For some reason my name is not coming up, it is Michael Noland,< /text>< response>

We had a wonderful experience purchasing my third new vehicle.. we were so happy at the end of our experience that we chose to stop at Lithia Nissan of Clovis. We were greeted by a very friendly, knowledgeable, driven sales person by the name of Medi Jiroudi. He greeted us with a  smile and a great personality. We asked about the 2019 Rouge and Medi immediately told us of all the great features and asked if we wanted to take it out for a test drive. We had our first experience on a self driving car! Medi helped us feel at ease and we enjoyed the ride.. not only did he take us out on a Rouge he also took us out in a 2019 Kicks! Both rides were great but my heart was stolen by the Kicks. Once we got down to numbers, that's where the "fun" began. I was firm on what I wanted to see as a car payment and Medi along with Edgar did EVERYTHING in their power to get me where I wanted to be, they worked diligently for us and we appreciated every bit of it. After the paperwork Medi took time to familiarize us with the cars technology step by step and was not in a rush despite the fact the closing time was minutes away.. Since my purchase Medi has checked on us several times.. he has made sure to remind us to contact him with any questions and let's us know that he is always available to us. Medi.. my husband and I thank you for your hard work and patience. We will refer family and friends to Lithia Nissan of Clovis and make sure that they ask for you.<//Text>

He made me feel comfortable and asked to leave everything on him. He did the job best to my satisfaction.

Will visit again Nissan Clovis and Erick specially.

<Review>Very poor experience purchasing a new car here. Would not recommend this place to anyone as the people are not forthcoming in setting expectations and mislead you the whole way. Too many people try to get involved and the left hand does not know what the right is doing, one person says one thing and the other does not honor it. Apparently everyone here is a manager of some sort, as they give away titles like participation ribbons. Will never shop here again and would not refer anyone to them ever.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The oil change was done professionally and quickly.  The complimentary car wash left alot to be desired with bugs all over the front fender and grill with residual water spots I tried to polish out that are not coming out even with the protective coat we had you put on when we purchased our car.  I will be taking our car to a detail place to remedy that problem.  Everything else was satisfactory in service knowledge and work.</Review>< pics>

When two other nissan dealerships told me I would be without a car because they were backed up I called this dealership that is farther away. Al Pacheco did not hesitate to get me taken care of right away and the entire staff was so friendly. Everyone helped me get my car back in shape and minimize any inconvenience it may have had on me. Thanks<//Text>

He actually made me feel comfortable. Thanks to Jorge for handling the paperwork process and making the unthinkable happen. I would recommend them to whoever is looking for a car.

<Review>I must say that I got a great service and deal at Lithia Nissan of Clovis. I am glad that I got serviced by a great sales team including John Pepper and Andrew Siegers. They patiently worked with me and went all routes to get my business and work with me with all options open that could help me get the best deal. I want to thank both these gentlemen for such great service and Jerry for getting me a reasonable APR through his bank.<//Review><rate>5<//rate><UserId.>111306648151131989560</UserId.></record>

He did not use high pressure tactics (a much appreciated and recognized facet), but was very forthcoming with information.  He said he was relatively new to the job and if he didn't have an answer he would find out for us.  I have no complaints with the service at all.  I would definitely recommend Steve again since he was the main contact along the way.</review>< Pics>

<Date>1432957981034< /Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I have been looking for a 2015 white pearl Murano with black leather interior. I was offered a great deal at Clovis Nissan for a potential purchase. I was told that the dealership will have to bring the car from another place. I was told a few times that the car was on the way. After three days nothing. Every time I would go to the dealer, the same people that were excited to sell me a car would not even look at me to either say hi, apologize, or try to work something out. After a few weeks, two ladies kept calling me, Ann and Pretty. They were desperate to get me back into the dealership to look at the car. They swore they now had the car and that they wanted to make things right. I was even told "I am touching the car right now. It is gorgeous!". I asked these ladies if they truly had the car and they kept saying it was in front of their eyes. I called in today to let them know I was going to come to look at the car. When I got there, guess what? as usual, there is no car. These people have deliberately lied to me several times. When they were caught in the lies, they walked pass by me without even making eye contact or offering an apology. This dealership already has several complaints in the way the do business. The people are untruthful, deceiving, misleading, and most of all, unprofessional. They lost my business. A business that openly operates based on lies does not deserve any monetary deals. On top of everything, the ladies constantly steal business by contacting clients from their own hard working sales people. If you absolutely need to buy a car at this dealer, talk to Johnny. Hard working salesman.

Went in to look at their used vehicle close to closing time. Was greeted by brother Brenda and Vincent and shown the vehicle and took it out for a test drive. It is a used 2016 vehicle that had some dents and dings and stains in the car. We were going to walk off and was approached by the owner? Or manager? Can't recall  and was told that it could be taken care of, they would take care of it. The sales man tried making me sign for the car before we even saw it. Needless to say we left with the car that night.

I went back the next day to have it taken care of. An hour later, the rude man came to inform me my vehicle was done handed me the key. I tossed out my coffee, he had already approached the door and asked someone where the car was. Then as I'm walking towards him, he points in a direction and tells me my car is there and walked away. Didn't even walk me to my car or ask if everything was satisfactory.

The car was washed, but in no way were the stains removed from the seat. It seemed like the car was just ran through a wash and wiped down. I understand that this is a used/leased vehicle that they are "taking a loss" on. However I am still paying 14K for it. This is a representation of the dealership itself. If you're going to buy used, don't buy from Nissan of Clovis. Oh, and the vehicle came with less than a quarter tank of gas. At this point, I feel that I have taken a much bigger "loss" than Nissan of Clovis.

Vincent Thao, the salesman, was very considerate and patient with us, very understanding and gave us the time and privacy that we asked for to discuss the purchase of the vehicle. A great salesman in my opinion. Has great customer service/bedside manner. Even had the service department replace the dead battery to the key. Called to follow up on the car the next day.

Bobby was also great! Nice guy, very polite, had all the papers completed in a timely manner.

There was another man involved with the sale, a man with an accent, who came off very rude and was telling me to initial a hand written note that I would purchase the car if he could get me the monthly payment that I was asking for. Not only was he RUDE, he was AGGRESSIVE, and INPATIENT. Made no sense to use the form or "technique" and made me want to leave Nissan just for that, and maybe I should have. If not for Vincent we would have just walked out. This is the same man who handed me my key after the service department "took care" of the stains.<//review>

<Review>Everyone is very friendly and helpful. I am waiting for my car to be serviced and they have a nice waiting area where you can get complimentary coffee or hot chocolate and free Wi-Fi. They are also looking for cars to buy and will give you a free appraisal of your car. They showed me a 2018 Nissan Rogue. I love it. It is $26,000 I believe and has the latest technology.< /Review>< Pics>

Get your business elsewhere. I was told my car will be ready in two days and here it is, 2 weeks, almost 3, and I'm still waiting. Getting impatient!

They've told me that they are fixing our car due to a recall and waiting on a part from Hyundai, saying it's Hyundai's fault for delaying the parts. But guess what? You've lost our trust because NISSAN, you are a big LIAR and FRAUD because Hyundai stated you've never called them! And there is no recall on anything, as of what we Know! Very shady company!

No one picks up your call or returns a call back unless they want MONEY from you. Lost my trust and business!!</Text>

<review>If you need to have your car serviced go somewhere else
All I got was a lot of waiting for a part... something that should have been simple became a 5 month waste of time. Funny how the only reason I know anything is because I called them and checked on it. I was never called back and I'm sure they were hoping I'd go away. Well I will give my business to someone who actually wants it.</review>< Pics>

Wow I hate to judge a book by the cover but it is hard to take someone seriously when the guy they sent out to us looked like a teenager from highschool he desperately attempted to sell us a truck that they didn't have on the lot. Never again such BS!!!
We bought a truck completely on the other side of California went there and got it ourselves. Which was worth dealing with them than dealing with our own dealership in our own back yard.</text>

Sales Reps at this Nissan do not care about you they only care about the money the sales manager George Lopez made it very clear he sat there and told us "We post cheaper prices online to get customers to come in and look if they knew the real price they wouldn't even come and look"

Great to know this dealership only cares about their money and making it and not your satisfaction. Sales Manager George Lopez said it's a common "marketing tactic" to post a false price online to get you to come in and that all businesses post a fake price to make customers come in and look. To translate he basically said we lie to waste your time and make money and it's no surprise he's ONLY BEEN WORKING THERE SINCE FEBRUARY 😂😂 what an experienced salesmen. To put the icing on the cake he tried to explain his reasoning by saying "Well if we put the car for 13k online and it's 16k in person and you don't see the online ad we just made an extra 3k "

I can't believe a sales person would EVER say something like that. I was shocked in my chair I immediately canceled our negotiation as I can't do business with a place who clearly only cares about profit and nothing  else you never win a customer over by talking about how much money is going in your pocket from the sale and how you don't care about honesty</Text>

Sales Reps at this Nissan do not care about you they only care about the money the sales manager George Lopez made it very clear he sat there and told us "We post cheaper prices online to get customers to come in and look if they knew the real price they wouldn't even come and look"

Great to know this dealership only cares about their money and making it and not your satisfaction. Sales Manager George Lopez said it's a common "marketing tactic" to post a false price online to get you to come in and that all businesses post a fake price to make customers come in and look. To translate he basically said we lie to waste your time and make money and it's no surprise he's ONLY BEEN WORKING THERE SINCE FEBRUARY 😂😂 what an experienced salesmen. To put the icing on the cake he tried to explain his reasoning by saying "Well if we put the car for 13k online and it's 16k in person and you don't see the online ad we just made an extra 3k "

I can't believe a sales person would EVER say something like that. I was shocked in my chair I immediately canceled our negotiation as I can't do business with a place who clearly only cares about profit and nothing  else you never win a customer over by talking about how much money is going in your pocket from the sale and how you don't care about honesty<//Text>

I was looking all day in the HOT sun for a car "104°", just ready to give up. Then a wonderful man named Kyle Rice approach me and my sister when we were looking at a car. He was very kind and answered all my questions. He went out of his way to make me happy 💕..  He was so AWESOME, I purchased my first car.... on top of that Kyle also talked to Angle the detail guy to clean up my car to my liking, I have an appointment scheduled whim in a week.  Angel was also awesome too.. he just wants me to leave Happy.. thank you guys very much you guys did make me very happy</text>

<text>I came in hoping to buy a pre-owned Nissan Sentra SV, Jorge, one of the sales Managers, I believe, had recommended a newer car. I was hesitant because I thought I would have to pay a whole lot more each month but he informed me that my interest rate would be a lot less if I were to go that route, so I did and i bought a Nissan Sentra Model S and I absolutely love it! Everyone was very nice and assertive. I'd like to thank Omar, Jorge, and Gerry for all their patience and willingness to understand what was being asked, I would highly recommend this place for a new or pre-owned vehicle. At Lithia Nissan of Clovis, they put their customers first before themselves and it was easy to see that! I'm very glad I had awesome people who were willing to help every step of the way. My payment is what I wanted and the car is immaculate and drives beautifully. I'm very thankful for this team! Thank you guys very much for everything! If you're looking to purchase a vehicle, I would recommend this location!You so<//text><date>1551556582859< /date><rating>5< /rating>< Resp>

Friendly customer service but when I got my car back the ac was blowing hot air. They wanted me to come in and charge me for a diagnosis and probably to fix it when it was their fault smh. My husband figured out what was wrong and isn’t need to go in and pay for Nissan to fix it.</Review>

<review>Had a good maintenance experience with my Infiniti G35 (this Nissan is closer than the Infiniti dealer).  I've been taking my car here for over a year and Mike has always been very helpful for me.  Service is sometimes slow, but they have a shuttle to take me to/from local locations.  It's always nice to get  a cleanly washed car at the end as well.  Email and web coupons are also very nice and can save lots of $$$.  Thanks Mike!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I hate car shopping. Salesman told me they NEVER haggle prices because lithia sets all prices and they cant deviate  from that, lol. Truecar shows average of $3,000 less than sticker price paid for most.  Assume salesman thinks I'm an idiot because I'm a female shopping for a car alone. Happens frequently compared to taking a male along. This place was the typical annoying salesman following you around telling you things they think you want to hear.. never give your real phone number unless you want a million follow up calls. Did not buy from them.<//Review>

<Review>I haven't dealt with the sales department, but be careful with the service department.   They tried telling my wife her Murano needed a new head gasket, engine would blow soon, "it was a mess under the engine", yadda yadda.  I got on the phone and told them we were coming down and to leave it on the lift.  We get there, vehicle was parked on the ground and they wanted to talk to us about trading it in.  I made them put it on the lift and show me "the mess"; I saw nothing out of the ordinary.

They went back to trying to get us to trade it in for a new vehicle, saying the service department wouldn't mention it to the sales department so we would get a good value for the vehicle.  We had 60k miles on it at the time, ended up driving it for another 45k with no issues. Needless to say we never went back there for service or a new vehicle.< /Review>< Resp>

Customer service is terrible. Was only provided 1 key with 1/4 of a tank of gas when I left. Nissan would not fill tank nor provide 2nd key. Only able to give a "phone number." Wouldn't even be willing to provide financial help on a key I looked up that cost $50 after I spent more than $20K on a car that day. If you're looking for a car lot to take all they can get from you Lithia Nissan of Clovis is your place.</Text>< Pics>

< review>
Been here 2 times now in the past couple of months. Once for a fix that was promised same day and wasn't given back until the following day without a rental...cost came out over $400 by the way. I was also promised a detail and health check of my car for the wait, which I never received. Now today my girlfriend is finally signing papers for her car she started 5 days prior! They gave her the run around and constantly tried to up the price of payments and down payment. If you're closer to another Nissan dealer or have other places in mind... GO THERE!!

P.S. They got another star because my girlfriend loves her car.. but you can get it at any other Nissan dealer.< /review>

Shocked and disappointed.  I leased my first vehicle from Nissan at their Fresno location.  Just prior to that lease expiring, I received a ton of advertising from both the Fresno and Clovis locations to buy a new vehicle.  I went to the Clovis store.  Tried to give the leased vehicle back, but they didn't want it.  Instead, they signed me into a new contract to buy (not lease) a new Nissan Altima and never told me that had I waited a couple of months to do this, I would have avoided an early termination fee.  As part of the deal, they told me they would pay off my remaining balance for the leased vehicle.  The check never arrived.  Finally, after months of calling and complaining, I was told that their sales manager had since been fired, and I wasn't the first victim.   Meanwhile, my credit took a dive because the financing arm of Nissan hadn't received the monies owed that the sales arm of Nissan promised me they would send to pay the financing arm.  Total and utter disconnect.  Next thing I know, I'm receiving aggressive calls from some collection company Nissan sends accounts to, asking me for $1,200.  I tried to call Nissan, but got passed back to the collection agency.  Trying to resolve this matter has been near impossible and involved many wasted hours of my time.  I have excellent credit that I've worked very hard to establish over the years.  Nissan were the friendliest people in the world when they wanted my money, but all but vanished when problems arose.  I would have been a customer for life.  I wouldn't recommend buying a vehicle from this company to my worst enemy.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I came into the dealership to test drive the 370z. I currently own Infinity FX 35 and had great luck with it so I considered the Z a prospect. I had test drove three comparable vehicles already, some way more expensive then the 370z $35000 internet asking price. My intention was to purchase a vehicle that day.  The Z was the deciding factor.  When I asked to take it on a test drive, I was told that test drives for “premium” cars required a credit check?? They said the GTR and the 370z were considered premium?? I understand the GTR would be, it’s a 100k car. ...but the Z??  Sluggish sales and all. Guys it’s a $ 35000 car??? So no test drive and I did buy a car that day. Guess what, it wasn’t the Z because I couldn’t even see if I liked it or not.  Running credit checks for a test drive of  a vehicle that’s been sitting in you dealership for over a year is poor business. They may have lost a sale but they and I will never know.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Everything was good, except at the very end of the deal, they refused to fix a broken lisence plate light that they promised to fix if I made the deal. Very low brow of them. I guarantee I won't bring my business back to them if they don't rectify this.<//Text>

Service department was friendly and helpful. I've had my car 3 months and lithia nissian continues to give great quality and experience, even after purchase.

Edit: Repeat customer. Because of my excellent buying experience with Clovis Nissian, took my husband to look for a new car. JD Graham was our product specialist and did not disappoint. Answered any questions we had and between him and finance Gerry, we were able to drive off in a brand new Nissian Sentra. Clovis Nissian continues to be the only place I will buy a vehicle. Not only do they make buying a vehicle a great experience, but they help maintain that vehicle after purchase and continue to provide great quality service.< /review>

<Text>Lithia Nissan obviously puts a lot of time and energy into ensuring their customer service team is top notch and it shows. Better customer experience than BMW or Mercedes by leaps and bounds, in my personal experience.<//Text>< Pics>

Never have been to a more disorganized, unprofessional dealership. I had an appointment to purchase a specific vehicle they had on their lot and when I arrived exactly on time, they told me someone else was signing the paperwork to purchase the car. They had no other equivalent car. I was lied to, I was told my appointment was the earliest the car would be available. The manager on duty lied to me and told me the other customer had an earlier appointment, while my sales manager told me the other customer was a walk-in. This place is a disaster and needless to say, I will never purchase a vehicle there.< /Text>

Look at another brand entirely. Both Nissan and Lithia should be your last choice based on my experience. I'm now dealing with recall work and nothing has changed since I stopped coming in a while ago. Unfortunately I have no choice on recall work.</text>

<Review>Was promised 2 free oil changes verbally for the new car I purchased (My 1st dealership car) and as we were filing and signing the paperwork the sales rep. Was distracting me with stories while they had me quiclly sign the forms. Amungst those forms was a form that said that all verbal agreements are void so now they don't want to grant me my oil changes. On top of that the sales rep. Got visible frustrated when I refused to get the GAP insurance package for my vehicle. Over I think this is very immoral and unethical of them and hence why I rate this place 1 star. Never buying vehicles from them again.</Review>< user>

I am happy with it because we don't have to shop and deal with shady sales people anymore. but I would work with lee all day. he is funny and not pushy at all. they have a really nice coffee machine to, which is a plus. we will be back when the lease is over on my accord. the Altima sr looks like a good replacement for it.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>We had a great experience purchasing a new 2015 Nissan Rogue SL. The entire staff was so friendly and willing to negotiate. Bobby, Sr. showed us around the lot and walked us through the numbers, JR helped with all the financing, and Bobby, Jr. showed us al the features of the car so we knew how to operate everything.

Since purchasing the car, they have followed up to ensure everything is going smoothly, and even filled up our gas tank and detailed the car. I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new car.<//review>< username>

<text>This is what car buying should be like.   I made a $1400.00 below MSRP offer for a 2016 Nissan Frontier SV 4x4.   Lithia accepted the offer.  We quickly completed the paperwork.  NO PRESSURE TO BUY ADDITIONAL WARRANTY  OR ACCESSORIES.  I highly recommend LITHIA NISSAN OF CLOVIS.  Go see Alfredo or Harvey.< /text>< user_id>

They dont tell you whats going i waited for the truck i was going to buy they said i was getting it and i signed the papers, the thing was i didnt personally see it nor test drove it they told us they were just waiting for the title and its not on the lot. A week went by and no update i went in and checked how it was going and still no update. So i went online saw the truck they showed us from just pictures and it was still on sale! I even called the dealer and asked if that specific truck was on sale they said yes! I canceled the "process" the next day. I just felt weird the whole situation i went with my gut and back out.< /Text>

<username>anna covarrubias<//username><text>I had an oil change scheduled today at 9am. I took my little ones thinking it wouldn't take more then 45 minutes...I was wrong... I sat there for 45 minutes and when I asked how much longer it would be my service advisor came to tell me my car was "up next" and had not even been serviced yet. When asking why I had made an appt at 9am he said this is normal and that it usually takes 1.5 hrs to have an oil change. I asked for my keys and left. Horrible customer service. Would not recommend to anyone.

Don't waste your time here, just schedule an appt with the Fresno one and they are very helpful and do not waste your time.< /text>< user>

The sales man was very helpful but not very knowledgeable about the car he was showing me.  They were too high pressure, especially on the vehicle I was looking at because I think they had it in their inventory quite awhile.</Review>

Had the worst experience with Clovis Nissan first I buy a vehicle 2 months ago 2014 Nissan Sentra take it back a week later Transmissions feeling bad they soaked all get the best top of the notch mechanic to check it he only takes 20 minutes and says everything's good normal I take it to a dealership they checked it they told me Transmissions out I take it back another mechanic took 8 hours to check it they finally say Transmissions bad only had 26,000 miles on it put a new transmission it starts acting up again brought it back they say it's normal for the transmission to be jerky going high speed RPMs all the way to 6 when you're barely going 20 miles 20 miles per hour then they try to push you out fast the movie cars around giving your paperwork opening the door forget it leave quick don't even give you a printout of what they did worst dealer ever sales and service<//text>

One day I was having problems with my car a 2014 Nissan altima and had taken it originally to the dealership I had bought it from which they couldn't figure out what was wrong with my car. Then when that happened I made an appointment with Nissan of clovis and rite away they found out the problem with my car. The workers there are professional and friendly with their customers I'll be taking my car there from now on.<//text>

Had a great experience at Lithia Nissan of Clovis thanks to Timothy Bowden and his team of gentlemen. Timothey and his team was curteous and helpful every step of the way.  Thanks..They found and fix the problem for which the Lithia Nissan of Fresno, CA could not.  The techinician couldn't find or hear the noise the car made. Even when I drove and could hear it make and I wear earing aids.  Oh did I say that I didn't even have them in at the time of the test drive..< /Text>

<Text>Let me preface my complaint with this: I have been a  very loyal customer of Nissan, and this dealer specifically, for almost 10 years.  Both my husband and I have bought multiple vehicles (costing over 200K) from them, and I would only have our cars serviced here because of their customer service and the trust I had in the mechanics.   Now, sadly, I will never go to this dealership again ! Ever since Lithia took over this dealership the customer service is terrible (except for one gentleman that has worked there since before the management changed)!  I have been dealing with simple manufacture warrentee issues for over fives months with little to no resolve.  My husband and I have been getting the run around, and when we actualy go in for these simple repairs Mike (the service rep) bad mouths everyone but himself and we recieve no follow thru, or follow up.  We have been lied too multiple times, and no one ever calls us back when we are told they will.  As I said before, we were very loyal customers but this kind of  disreguard for doing your job, whats right ,and what should be expected is just too much to overlook.  Honestly, I don't trust that my vehicle is being taken care of to the best of its abilities, and I don't trust the people working there.  Don't be fooled by their kindness and smiles, behind the scene they don't get anything done with pride , professionalism or respect.  I am really dissapointed and I am now lost because I don't know where to go to have my car serviced, and I don't know where to go to buy my next vehicle< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
On 2/7/15, I went to Lithia Nissan of Clovis and the customer service exceeded my expectations.   Prior to arriving I had received a phone call from the General Manager, Adam Marazzo and he was the most pleasant General Manager that I ever spoke to.   He engaged with me as if I was already one of his customers by the way he spoke to me and when I went  to Lithia he treated my husband and I like family.   He definitely earned our trust and because of the way he treated us he made customers for life.   Anytime you go to a dealership it can be intimidating and it is something that most people dread.   I can honestly say that we had a fun experience, yes a fun and enjoyable experience and by that we all had positive results.   I wasn't intending on buying a vehicle that day but because of the way we were treated and listened to us we felt confident in the General Manager that he was doing everything to meet our needs.   We were also assisted by Internet Sales, Ken Herzog and he had so much enthusiasm about his job and made a very enjoyable experience for us and he provided a lot of knowledge about the vehicle.   We purchased the vehicle without even doing a test drive.  The Lithia Nissan of Clovis is by far the best dealership that I had contact with and I will continue to do business with them.   You don't usually get much or any interaction with the General Manager but Adam was so on it and made sure that we were happy the entire experience.  I cannot say enough about him he did everything he could to make it such a enjoyable experience.   The list goes on, I enjoyed working with Kevin Cavin, Preddy and Jessica.  Kuddos to your staff they know how to have fun and make you laugh and buy a car.  That usually doesn't happen all in one experience usually you love the car but not so much the experience or deal.  Your staff was extremely passionate about their jobs.  I am loving my new 2015 Nissan Altima and I will be back and will continue to extend my experience with my family and friends.

<review>Luis and Bobby were very knowledgeable and friendly. We did not feel pressured at any time to make a decision we weren't comfortable with. They had plenty of options in stock for what we were looking for. Ultimately, we found a car we love for a price we could afford. Thanks everyone, we will be back again!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Today I purchased a new truck from Lithia Nissan of Clovis, the staff there went above and beyond, to help us get into the perfect vehicle they were thoughtful and considerate and very very patient with my wife and myself, Brenda Vang is our new go to for purchasing vehicles she answered our phone call and immediately provided exemplary customer service the amount of energy she provided was enough to pull us through finding our new vehicle, Julian Perez also took the time to sit down and listen to all of our concerns and wants he was patient and encouraging on us getting exactly what we wanted and not just trying to push us into a larger purchase, Bobby Lopez than helped us get approved for the vehicle we wanted at the rate and payment we wanted and believe me this was no easy task as we DO NOT HAVE PERFECT CREDIT! Thank you for all your hard work and helping us make a dream come true.</Text>< Gmap_id>
