I had gas leak inside my stove. After bad experience with another company i called Appliance repair master. They were pretty quick at identifying the problem. It was small tiny leak. Tech fixed it and put new fittings. Great Job!</review>

<text>My LG fridge died on me and was skeptical of having it fixed and was contemplating of buying a used one.  My wife suggested to have it serviced first since buying was not in our budget.  Greg,  of APPLIANCE REPAIR MASTER,  came promptly the next day and started assessing the problem.  He us kind and courteous and showed where the problem started.  I am giving these shop a five star since not only did he fixed and replaced the needed part but also gave us pointers on how to care for my old 2002 LG refrigerator<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM77cdb-lDL0qxb1rxgJ6ODVtcf8lYX3qB0pv-8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><user_id>117954362131870481758</user_id><gmap_id>0x808fcbf3229f492d:0xe8383231f91ea667< /gmap_id><Rate>5< /Rate><resp>None< /resp>< user_name>

Our 7 year old Wall heater was repaired by Max of Appliance Repair Master San Jose. He was prompt and arrived as promised, early on Monday morning. Quickly diagnosed the problem which was in the control board. The part was ordered and replaced when it came in few days later. Max as a person was prompt, knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with. The cost for parts and labor seemed reasonable, chipper than new one. Thank you Max< /review>

<text>This is our first time to have ARM repair our fridge and we are so happy. Their booking agents were polite and courteous, they tried to find the fastest appointment for us as our fridge stopped working. When the technician came he did a thorough checked and found the problems right away and placed order for parts. We are very please with the technician, not only professional but he was also very courteous and polite. He took his time to explained thing for us. Thank you  and especially Max for a great experience.<//text>< Name>

"I'm happy with the same day service. I called them on Monday evening, because I had problems with my dryer machine, Max and Bill came to my home on Tuesday morning. They are acted very professionally. Without any questions they fixed dryer, and that's didn't take long. I would definitely recommend this company!

My refrigerator had a problem that it was not cooling enough in both freezer and refrigerator area. I called Joe for the refrigerator repair today. He was quick to identify the problem that the timer had gone bad and there was some drain pipe issue as well. He repaired these quickly. Joe is quite professional and I will recommend him for the refrigerator repair<//review>

My less than 1 years old fridge unexpectedly broke down so I called these guys at 11pm, and left a voicemail to call back. I got a call from Scott first thing the next morning (around 7:30AM). He came the same day and had my fridge fixed by noon. Super efficient! Pleasure to deal with this company.<//Review>

(the best part!) The mechanic was very nice and explained thoroughly of what is wrong and what needs to be done.

Turns out the heating element was not defrosting the ice on the evaporator coil. Joe also got  a spare part in his van. He did a very neat job and even cleaned the freezer after his job was done. I'm very impressed  with their service. No need to mention an affordable price for that repair . Thank you Joe!< /review>< Pictures>

I wouldn't recommend this company. I even moved my work schedule to accommodate the available schedule. The technician didn't show up at the scheduled time without any further communication. I called the operator and operator contacted the technician to give me the changed ETA time. I even gave the technician extra time in case the technician was stuck in the traffic. However, the technician still no show. I  have to cancel the appointment and call another company. It wasted my time. I give one star because google review doesn't take zero star.< /Text>

The tech Greg came within the allocated time limit of 2 hours. The appointment was scheduled a day before. This was the fastest service repair I have seen.

Technician took time to diagnose and explained me every question I had. The price quoted for the entire part was decent enough. The Technician also added a 6-month warranty for the repair he did. Will definitely recommend him for any issues for Refrigerator.</text>

My close family always gets in touch with Appliance Repair Master for all of our appliance repairs. We know Tom, Bill and Max. They service all major makes and models of refrigerators, stoves, laundry appliances and much more. Their techs waste no time responding and get right to work on the task at hand. I can’t thank them enough for the outstanding service they have provided over the years.< /review>

First time here. Great wine flight options. Happy hour ends at 645. Not bad.

Had the burger and fries. Was pretty good but I wish they gave me more sides than lettuce, ketchup and pickles. Tomatoes, mustard, aioli, and onions would be better.

Service can be very slow. So just be patient.</Review>

I really liked this place.
Simple, impeccable service, and great fresh food. The chicken liver plate and the soup of the day were super tasty. And I loved the frisee salad. The egg on top had this incredible breading on it.
Was happy we finally tried Garcon. Neighborhood french spot.</text>

We ordered the escargots as appetizer, hanger steak frites for dinner and then of course we couldn’t miss dessert so we ordered the chocolate lava cake, YUMM! Everything was amazing, it makes me happy when we decide to experiment a new restaurant and find a hidden gem.

But for the price I wasn't feeling it. I had the French Onion soup and the steak fritz. I felt that the soup was good but not great. The steak was so-so and the french fries were probably the best part of the meal. In my perspective I compare it to Blue Plate which I love - and it just doesn't come close to being that good.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Rude manager! There was a sign outside their door that said happy hour was from 5-630pm. Upon entering the building I was screamed at by a tall, balding old looking French man, telling me they weren't open until 5:30. I informed him of the sign outside that indicates happy hour at 5-630. He screamed again telling me it said 5:30pm not 5:00pm. I immediately left and watched him carry the sign inside. Please don't waste your time here, go some place else where they care about their customers and service.</review>< Gmap_id>

The mussels were huge and flavored very nicely in the broth. The duck was cooked to perfection with well balanced sides! We got a pamplemoose cocktail and it had the perfect amount of gin in it, it was deliciously sweet and tart with grapefruit and the lemon olive oil finished it off perfectly. The waiters and waitresses were very pleasant!< /Review>< pictures>

Went here for dinner on a Thursday.  We walked in without a reservation at ~7:30 and got a cosy table for two in the back room within a few minutes.

The server was gracious with the wine recommendations.

We split the sea bass and arugula salad.  The salad's dressing was sweet and the toppings--pistachios, crumbled cheese, and pomegranate seeds--balanced each other perfectly both in flavor and texture. The sometimes bitter flavor of the arugula itself was pleasantly subdued by all that.

The sea bass was perfectly golden, moist, and delicious.<//Review>

Great food and wine. A little loud. We had a delicious cheese and duck prosciutto to start followed by the snapper and pork tenderloin. Both mains were also fabulous.</Text>

<text>Really quality food and service.  It gets pretty busy so you'll want reservations.  Portions on some plates are small but others large.  The salmon for example isn't a ton but if you get the burger which is half the price you get a s- ton of frites</text>< resp>

<review>I have been going here for many many years. The last time unfortunately will be the last time I step foot foot in this place. The staff was well aware that there were extremely loud screaming women who had had too much to drink and refused to intervene and make then quiet down, forcing me to do so. Talk about a great way to ruin an evening .... having to yell at people in your dining room to shut up. This was the job of the staff not the patrons<//review><gmap_id>0x808f7e3efc3d18d1:0xa68e89fedd10b446<//gmap_id>< response>

<Text>The filet mignon, potato leek soup w/pork renderings, along w/the foi gras & perfectly toasted slices w/a bit of buttery goodness.  My dining partner had the duck confit, shared the foi gras; all good choices before the theatre across the street.  Definitely would go again.</Text>< username>

The staff is super nice and really cares, and here is a true statement: the sweat breads, coq au vin and beyond everything the duck confit are the best in town! You simply can't miss this place.

Our food was quite late coming out but they were on top of it and brought us a complementary amuse-bouche, (some delicious fish croquettes!) so I'm not even mad!<//Text><resp>None</resp>< time>

Boy oh boy. Where do I start... Why can't I leave negative stars google?

First off, THIS IS NOT A FRENCH CUISINE RESTAURANT. The bartender spoke with a fake accent and had to look at a bartenders app on his phone to make our drinks. Which took him about 10 minutes a drink to make.  A grey goose straight up martini which I am 100% sure was not grey goose. I drink them often...

On to the fabulous food,
Started with a french onion soup. Had better french onion soup from the frozen isle of Safeway. It had zero flavor. Seriously, how can you mess up a french onion soup at a "French Restaurant"

Next up was the Coq Au Vin entree. Yuck!!!!
Picture a burned tiny little chicken quarter sitting in a bowl of red wine with a few chunks of potatoes and baby carrots. Dead serious...

Then came the bill....
A party of 10 of us with a few bottles of wine was well over 1000 dollars.
If this is French food then Mexico is the new France! One trip to the bathroom, which is in the kitchen will make you realize there is zero French chefs inside cooking your food.</review>

Great food but service definitely operates at a European pace. Try the steak frites.< /Review>

Some of the best French food in San Francisco, and one of my favorite restaurants. Try the Black & Basil cocktail.</review>

I absolutely love this place, it's my go to French restaurant - granted I live about 3 blocks from it ;-) I love their drinks - great cocktails, good wine and amazing cognac (get a glass of Prunier and ask them to heat up the glass a little) - and I really like their food (my favorites: the sweetbread, truffle cheese, coq au vin, bone marrow). I also just meet up with my friends here quite often, because it's a relaxed place to get a drink and some appetizers at the bar before you continue your night elsewhere.
Definitely try it if you are in the neighborhood!<//Text>

From the moment I came in garçons door I was captivated by the warm lighting, and the Parisian decor. Garçons staff was knowledgable, and friendly.  I ordered the Roasted cauliflower soup with truffle creme it was superb! Next came garçons signature duck pâté it was creamy, and the fresh herbs in it made it so flavorful. The entree was garçons Swordfish...Wow it was perfect! Served on a bed of spinach with fresh olives, succulent white beans, and roasted red peppers, it was perfect! I finished the experience with creme brûlée, and garçon did it beautifully. I can't wait to try the whole menu!</text>

I never thought much of Garcon because I've been to many of the highly acclaimed French restaurants in San Francisco, and didn't think a little place on the corner in the Mission would ever be able to compete. Plus, reviews were mixed and many people complained about the price. I was pleasantly surprised that Garcon delivered great food and even better cocktails. It was pricier than I expected, but it was good and I would definitely return for cocktails and appetizers!

* Complimentary Bread - Could not stop eating this.

* Black and Basil - 5 STARS: Black Pepper, Basil, lime, Vodka, and Gin. Wow, amazing cocktails. The cocktails here are serious contenders to my other Mission favorites, including Locanda, Range, Hog and Rocks, and Lolinda.

* Wine: Tuesdays = no corkage. Keep in mind you can't stack a 30% off Savored Discount on top of this deal. Thought the wines were pricey and overrated.

* Duck Liver Pate - 3.5 STARS: Very tasty pate, but not mind blowing.

* Mussels - 4 STARS: Fennel, shallot, lavender, lemon, pastis-chardonnay broth. I wanted to drink the broth. So light and tasty, and perfectly complemented with the bread.

* Duck - 4 STARS: Duck confit, twice cooked potatoes, frisee, arugula,  sunflower seed, vermouth vinaigrette. Amazing flavor, so delicious.

* Steak Frites - 4 STARS: Would have been a solid 5 stars except it was a little chewy, and I wasn't a huge fan of the short overly oily fries. The execution and sauces were incredible though!

* Creme Brulee - 4.5 STARS: Blood orange supremes, citrus vanilla syrup, lavender madeleine/ Everyone raves about this more than they should, but don't get me wrong, it was really good! Super creamy and rich but light at the same time. Not one of those super thick and chunky creme brulees.

* Panna Cotta - 1 STAR: Topped with melons. Very gelatinous and bouncy panna cotta, and the topping tasted a bit medicinal. Not my favorite dish of the night.</text>

Though I lowered my expectations after seeing the blue ("look at me") explamation point, there turned out to be no need. Garçon! delivered some of the best french food I have had in the city.  With the dine about town prix fix menu, every course was remarkable as was the wine.  The atmosphere is a lively mix of french staff and a young crowd.  In the end a blue explamation was in fact à propos.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is a French restaurant with typical dishes. The waiters were even French for their accent, and the food was pretty decent. Prices are not high for SF so I would say fine but not cheap either. A good place to have an intimate dinner or a place where you can have a long conversation while having dinner.

Los precios no son elevados para SF, así que diría que bien pero tampoco barato.

The bartender didnt even know how to make a lemon drop or a whiskey sour or a surfer on acid....well actually she stated that's what gave us but they tasted and looked nothing like they should. We paid, still tipped and took off. Looked like a lively crowd though.</Review>

<user_name>KillaSurge562</user_name><Date>1525552882983< /Date><Review>Went last night and was harrassed by multiple people while i was minding my own buisness. Even the bartender told me to get out. I was accused of tagging but I DONT TAG. They all pushed me out the bar and i was about to get jumped until someone else stepped in. Also the bartender (asain or filipino?) said i tried to "get over on her" when i drunk man spilled my drink and told her about it. Worst experience ive ever had there and ive been going for 2 years. That bartender is unprofessional anyways always on the phone during her shift. BRING BACK SUNNY!!!!<//Review>< user_id>

This place is awesome if you're bartender it's a blonde and doesn't ask for your ID EVEN if you've been there for 2 to 3 hours. My boyfriend and I come here all the time and there are only two bartenders who always ask for our ID after we've been here for a couple of hours. I came out of the restroom and the first thing she did was approach me and ask me for my ID. Don't know if we'll ever come back here. She's seen me at least 15-20 times and she keeps harassing me. All the other bartenders know us expect some blonde and some brunette who passes our IDs to other people at the bar?!?!?!? If this is customer service then I guess we'll take our business somewhere else. Sucks for them cause we usually spend $30 or more everytime. If this continues we'll never be back. But we'll miss the good bartenders Kelly and a few others.</Text>

This store is small.  But very clean.  You can order a sandwich and eat outside the patio, overlooking the ocean.<//Text>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>Got the Oven roasted chicken salad with spinach and melted provolone cheese on top of my chicken breast, with Subway vinaigrette dressing—and it was delicious!

Not that many calories, so I hope it was a healthy lunch.  But not too filling either, so now I kind of regret not getting a sandwich and enjoy one of their tasty fresh-baked breads at a lower price, lol.

Gorgeous views of the Pacific Ocean from the outdoor seating at this location.< /review>< pictures>

Reasons to avoid this place nowadays include:
1) About 30% of the menu is covered up - not available, so not many choices;
2) Environment/atmosphere is not warm/welcoming;
3) They do NOT take printed official Subway coupon;
......

I would go to other Subway, not this one any more.< /Review>

This Subway store features outside seating with amazing vista. You can see Catalina on a clear day.

Service and food are average.

Parking is free at Golden Cove Mall. The views of the ocean are amazing.< /text>

Prompt service. can get very busy. Pretty much the same as any subway. you know what you're gonna get, just be patient. outside seating area is nice. Eat there or plenty of other spots nearby that are even more tranquil, quiet, peaceful.<//Review>

Yummy as always! This Subway's has a bathroom!
Edit: I returned on a different visit and ordered a steak and cheese but I did not want it heated, I wasn't going to eat the sandwich until the following day. The sandwich artist wouldn't serve it to me cold they said they couldn't do it. To heat up a sandwich and then place fresh spinach and other vegetables on it and wrap it up hot a wrapper the next day it would have been mush. I ended up leaving without him making my sandwich.
None of this makes any sense because all of their meat is already cooked.</text>

<Text>This is by far one of the worst subways I have been to. The guy who makes the sandwiches is some kid who puts like one onion or a few pieces of lettuce. Bread is always dry and service is slow.</Text>< Pics>

There system works on wifi and if your debit/credit transaction won't work, they have been told not to provide any compensation and you'll leave without a sandwich.... Friend stood there for a good 15 min and was basically told sh*t out of luck.

They have great food here and most of the employees are nice. I like coming here during the morning. I came on Friday to get my usual footlong,  Teresa greeted me with a big smile and a warm hello. Except for one of the employees, I think her name tag said Lupe, she’s terrible. I loathe coming here when she’s working. She has such bad attitude and always makes me feel like I’m asking her for something when she’s the one working for the customer. She needs some training on customer service. I will just go to a different subway if I keep being mistreated.</text>

<Review>This is the 2nd time the same young lady over charges me by separating the meal order. I don't care it's just $1.5 but its annoying!

Lady asked me if I’m ready to make an order. I said I need sometime. She said: “Ok. Let me when you are ready.” She left and never showed up. Other 3 employees didn’t pay attention to me. Waited for 10 mins and left. Awesome service.</text>

I have celiac disease, and have always brought my own gluten-free bread. After several times, the manager was there, and he specifically told the staff to not accept my bread due to nonexistent "health issues", even though if I ate it I would have "health issues".< /Text>

< review>
everytime i come to this subway i am always stuck with the same rude and nasty woman making my sandwich. I have never met someone with such a bad attitude in my life. everytime i get a sandwich from here i am very disapointed with how badly it was made. Today i got 2 sandwiches which i specificly asked to go light on the sauce but she still proceeded to overload the sandwiches with sauce. by the time i got home the sandwiches were all soggy and ruined. i would highly recomend going to the subway in rolling hills at the peninsula shopping center if u want a quality sandwich.< /review>

Really cool place to take kids. We were all surprised that the aquarium was our favorite part because they advertise the rainforest a lot on their website. They have some awesome seahorse displays that you won't want to miss! Make sure you pack your own lunch, and good luck finding parking.< /Text>

Best Damm show ive ever seen. Kimbra was amazing. This place is Kool. I just want to know what those big rocks out side are from. I came early and waited for hours. No one showed up till about 530 and Kimbra passed right in front of me. I didn't have my glasses so I didn't see it was her till she was right in front. Missed opportunity to say hello. :(</Text>

My experience here was fun. I enjoyed the ambiance. It's located walking distance from a few bars, so once you park you can have a few drinks and watch a movie. I'll definitely be going back soon.< /Text>

<review>This venue hosts the United States Weight Category Kyokushin Karate Championships every year the last Sunday in January.  It is located in the Little Tokyo area and is a wonderful venue to watch knockdown Karate action live.  There are nice places to eat nearby and within walking distance of Union Station if you dont mind walking a little.</review>< pictures>

Venue is good. But never park in the next door garage.  Took half hour to get out as paying when you leave and slow exit cause much delay.  Theater is comfortable.<//review>

Saw Allegiance with George Takei.   Enjoyed it immensely.   The theater is very nice, not too big, and the acoustics were fine.  Highly recommend it.</text>

<text>Needs more restrooms, and the seats themselves were a bit of a tight fit (and I'll not a large person), but the aisles were wide enough that people could pass by without everyone having to stand up.   Which is important because in the balcony, there was no center aisle, so all 50 ppl had to get in one side or the other.  Nice size venue to watch a live performance.  Full orchestra pit to boot!</text><Rating>4<//Rating><name>Cami Kidder< /name>< date>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>The theater's located next to the Japanese Buddhist Temple (exact name escapes me at the moment), and the entrance of the theater faces the quad.

People collecting tickets are right at the door (one entrance), this is pretty much a 1 show/screen large theater of a semi-sphere. There are multiple doors into the theater based on where your seats are located.

Overall, comfy seats, good audio, large stage and screen. To my knowledge, a lot of independent films are shown here, especially during the film festival, and the cast/crew will come up on stage afterwards for Q&A. I also understand that there are live performances as well.</Text>< Pics>

This is a nice theatre. Pretty comfortable. Not enough bathrooms though. The line at intermission is ginormous! I tried using the assisted listening device and it didn't seem to be working. Luckily, I didn't really need it for this musical.</Text>

Great venue, adjacent parking $10 cheap for LA, and by adjacent I mean exit onto the plaza across which is the theater. Great accoustics, comfortable seats. Friendly staff. We saw Allegiance. Very powerful, very timely, very thought provoking.<//Review>

Wonderful programming! Comfortable space that feels intimate. The acoustics are ok - better than Pantages, not as great as the Disney lol so you may want to take that into consideration when you select seats. Views are consistently good.<//Text>

The seating was miserable.  There is no middle aisle, so to get to the middle seats you have to scoot past umpteen people.</Review>

<Review>The Theater: Mid-size theater. I was sitting on the mezzanine, still good view. They do sell drinks (including alcohol but can't bring into the theater)

The Show: "Allegiance" is AWESOME!! George Takei is fantastic. He is really in the show from the beginning to the end. The story is amazing... I got really emotional at the last scene. Highly recommended!!!

The Parking: Parking structure with theater validation pre-paid $9. Street metered parking (some side streets, free after 6pm)< /Review>< pics>

The location is great and the acoustics is half decent for a community theatre. Unfortunately, the parking is horrible. It took us over 50 minutes to get out of the lot after our concert.<//text>

This is the home to many great live shows in Little Tokyo. From the New Years' Kotohajime to Traditional Noh, Kabuki Dance, and Taiko Shows. Check with the theater or the JACCC for events.</text>

This place was the bomb!!! really good spicy southern chicken sandwichs and friendly service. Kluckin is pretty great. Their chicken is very juicy and is seasoned well. I really enjoyed their fries too. Nothing super special but kept it simple with just salt and that's all that was needed. Sauce was amazing and I could eat it alone. Overall, the whole meal was pretty good. Got a combo 1 and a combo 2. Sandwiches are relatively large and tasted great all around. Got the mild and hot heat level. The mild is standard mild, but the hot was pretty nice for me personally. It wasn't spicy but it had a small kick to it which is how I like my spice. Personally, I'm good with spicy, so I definitely wouldn't recommend the hot heat level for someone with low heat tolerance. Big thank you to Edgar for making the meal and service an A+!< /Review>

<Review>Went out looking for a chicken sandwich place that was open late and could not find one close to me so I drove out pretty far. To be completely honest this chicken sandwich was completely worth it. The chicken was thick, just the right amount of crispy and the meat was still juicy. The spice level was pretty spot on too and it had such a great flavor. Gigi, the guy manning the cash register said that I’d be back, and he’s definitely right. This place is FANTASTIC. Definitely a 5/5

Anyone who wants to buy from here please be careful. Food taste so bad, you can taste how cheap it is but overpriced. GO TO DAVE’S HOT CHICKEN instead. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE TOO. JENIFER WAS SO RUDE AND WAS SPEAKING TO ME IN A VERY UNPROFESSIONAL WAY. PLEASE STAY AWAY. THEY GAVE ME THE WRONG ORDER. IS A SANDWICH A HOT DOG NOW??< /Text>

Sushi roll bar! You can order the rolls individually or in a set!
When you buy it in a set, the chef will deliver them to you in order that best suits the flavors. The chef is mindful to give the people in your group the orders with the same timing.
It's a great light lunch spot! Expect a wait!</Text>

<Date>1598305557182<//Date><rating>4<//rating><Text>Just came in yesterday. I've been to almost every Nashville style hot chicken place around Los Angeles and have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing this place is. Everything from the moistness of their chicken to the seasoning on the fries tastes incredible. You can tell they put a lot of thought to what they're selling. They definitely aren't stingy with their portions and have an incredible sauce on the side with all their meals.
Please give them a shot! It'll be the best independently ran hot chicken restaurant you'll run into. And who doesn't love being the first to know about a new great place? :)< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>The Kluckin Chicken has blown away all competition and still has thousands of people lining up for hours for a chance to try their famous chicken. I must say the both times that I've tried it - I had it hours later and it was still delicious. Pop it in a toaster oven or an air fryer and you're good to go.< /text>< pictures>

You know the chickens are good when you eat it cold and the skin is still crunchy. Love the sides and how efficient the place is during this covid to go every meal times. The pro tip is to get the mac and cheese.<//review>

I'm a broke college student and I just spend 20 dollars on food that wasn't even good. I rather eat the chicken at my old high school< /Review>

<Text>My absolute fave place to order from every time I crave a spicy AF chicken sandwich! The reason I love it is, first if all, they do NOT lie about it being hot LOL most places add the teeniest amount of spice. Second of all, the chicken is so crispy and the coleslaw always hits the spot with a hint of freshness to cleanse the palate from the heat.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>Omg!!! The chicken sandwich was amazing.  I ordered the mild, it had a nice little kick to it.  The special sauce along with the coleslaw added the best taste to the pallets. Oh, I almost forgot about dipping my fries in the special sauce that I received on the side try it.  This was the best tasting chicken sandwich I have had.  The food was hot and fresh, too.  I will definitely be back.<//review><Name>Carla Miller</Name><UserId.>117420246692838884990<//UserId.>< resp>

I stumbled upon this place while looking for another restaurant and the food here taste exactly how you would expect it to taste! AMAZING! I came here at midnight and my food was fresh and I received my order super quick in under 7minutes I’m shocked this place doesn’t have a line around the block it’s so good! This is my new Friday night spot! If you’re in the area make sure to give Kluckin Chicken a shot! I guarantee you they won’t let you down!</Review>

Came in on a late after a shift. Too a chance on a new place and I'm glad I did. I had the wrap and was so satisfied that I came back a few weeks later. The owner remembered me and helped me pick new menu items to try. The food is tasty and the service is awesome.  I'll be back again.< /Review>

The only thing that I really enjoyed was the sauce. The mild chicken sandwich was ok; it didn't bring any shazam to my tastebuds. Pickles were ight and the chicken didn't sell it for me. The bread bun wasn't toasty, so it wasn't my favorite either. The fries on the other hand were very potatoe-y. They weren't fried/prepared all the way; I didn't like how ripe they tasted. It was also flavorless, the seasoning was very close to non-existent. The orange sauce was the only thing that made the meal pop. Great, great taste!

Overall, the presentation of the food was good along with the price. The mild chicken sandwich and fries came to a total of $10.94 which is great for the quantity. Even though the meal wasn't memorable, service was great and the wait time for order-takeout was 6 to 10 minutes.</text>

I was walking with my son and puppy and we came across the Kluckin Chicken with it's original menu that makes your mouth water. We met the owner of the restaurant a really nice man, he was so sweet to my son and humble he gave my son a sandwich after he heard me tell my son that I had left my wallet at home...thank you so much that was really a kind gesture and the sandwich and fries it was delicious my son really liked it...I will definitely tell people to go and eat here the food is delicous and the environment is great...thank you once again and I'll be back soon...< /Text>

I cannot wait to see what they have coming to this station. The cashiers and management are super friendly and absolutely professional in their customer service and customer care. I'll be stopping by here more than anywhere else.< /text>< pics>

So all I can say is that while there may be other gas stations in there area, this Mobil is contemporary, and filled with so many goodies, snacks, drinks, and other delicious and delectably enjoyable and enticing desires to make anyone feel happy and positive. Even the atmosphere and environment here are positively accommodating and peacefully engaging. The other stations just don't make me feel welcome and positive like this place, no matter the day or time of my visits.</Text>

< Review>
This Mobil station is a convenient neighborhood store, they have everything you can think of, from one's favorite energy drinks, to one's favorite candy and chips. The employees and staff are always smiling, and courteous. This is an uplifting place to stop by, and very professional. They always help me fill my gasoline, no matter how busy they may be.< /Review>

I gave this score because i really enjoyed my experience with Joe. Not only was he at the front area waiting for us, he greeted us like we were old friends. He also had our taxes from the previous year and had notes from them. He was on top of it. I was really impressed with him and how efficient and thorough he was. He doubled checked things and did everything he could to get us the most that he could. He had us out of there in a reasonable amount of time and i most definitely will recommend him to others and will be coming back just to see Joe.  I really enjoyed my experience with him and so did my husband.< /Review>

Joe Carona is a life saver.  Literally.  Helped me find that I had erroneously set up something on my w-4, and helped me correct it during the same visit.  He is hands down the best tax expert I know.  Very knowledgeable, and the friendliest guy you'll ever meet.

< review>
If I could I wouldn’t even give them a star. When I made my appointment last year it was to be with a woman named Melissa. I went in on my scheduled day and because of my last name, being of Hispanic they changed me to a woman named Lupe. Now I did feel a little discriminated against because they specifically said “oh, we think Lupe will be a better match for you”.When she walked up to me she made the assumption I spoke Spanish and immediately spoke in Spanish. Now I’m a firm believer in not labeling anyone because of their race, sex, age or anything else and get very upset when people make assumptions of me because of my race or last name and that was the second thing that set me off. When we sat down to file my taxes she misspelled two simple words. I believe they were “here and support” I sat there and waited to see if she would correct them as we went over it and she didn’t, I had to point out the misspelled words. It was frustrating nonetheless, then after all that she was entering her friend’s name as someone who referred her to me so they could make the 20$ extra. I couldn’t believe it, I was very disappointed with their services. They charged way too much on top of all that! They tried emailing me to resolve the problem last year and I called them and left a voicemail as well as email, I got no response. I went to The Tax and Accounting Group in Oceanside off Mission ave and they were great! They made small talk and got me the most I’ve had in a long time! Price was fair and I will be going back to them from here on out!

Some advice to all who read these, don’t waste your time or money here.<//review>

I do not recommend using this location to file your taxes for this year. The location has not kept up with technological advances with printing and the internet, and their customer service was absolutely horrible.

Upon coming to H&R block the first time, I was told that I had to have everything printed. I asked to use their computer, of which the first one was extremely slow and unusable. When presented with a usable computer, all file sharing sites and email are block per H&R security standards, making it impossible to access all the paper work for them to use. I was then told that the only way to print my documents was to go to staples. I paid 45 dollars to print all my documents.

I left my documents for them to start working on for my previous statements. I returned 4 days later for another appointment to find that they did not enter any of the information or started it.

The woman that I spoke with was extremely rude and condescending. As I explained my position as a new business owner, she proceed to do everything short of lecturing me on extremely obvious business starting knowledge, none of which I asked for from her. She continued and was not clear in explaining the forms to me or providing reasonable explanations to the questions I had.

For the amount of work she did, I was able to file on Turbo tax just the same this evening and in less time that she took to punch in my own information.

I was very displeased at my experience and I do not plan on using H&R block at any location ever again.< /review>

<review>The line is very short. We order 2 drinks and wait 15 MINUTES for our drinks, then the barista accidentally spills one of the drinks and has to make it again, which took another 5 minutes. We wasted 25 minutes when it should have been 10.<//review>< pictures>

I didnt say anything else so I wouldn't hold up other people's drink. This is the first time I get such rude service at Starbucks. Definitely not going there again.

Most of the baristas really just want to get customers their drinks as quickly as possible but there are so many drinks that it can be stressful. So I understand if they might come off as a little rude from time to time.< /review>

<review>This is a great place to watch movies. They have comfortable seats and a cozy ambiance. The food is great and customer service was outstanding. I've been to another movie house like this in the area, but there is no comparison. This is exceptional and one of a kind. Everything you get here was so affordable. Highly recommended!< /review>< Pictures>

<Time>1520315463561</Time><Text>A historic little cinema, Little Tokyo adjacent.  Historic because this was the Linda Lea, one of the first LA theatres to show classic Japanese movies when they were current. It was dead for the longest time, then first became the Imaginasian Theatre, them the Downtown Independent. I believe they still have 35 and 16mm film projection capabilities as well as modern digital projection. A little theater with heart and soul. Keep it alive.< /Text><user_name>Michelle Klein-Hass</user_name><rate>5</rate><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3MyQHw1J6mwXRzxPla7V8vJVv9EzOnpLHh_N4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOE5ZUdKnT5g_G4HTZhhBriQqqUUtxLvEK22Jdl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

My sister and I were huge movie buffs. We went to see our favorite movie at this cinema. The audio was clearly audible, and the setting was ideal. You should relax in a comfortable seat and concentrate on what you're seeing. I will undoubtedly return to this place.</Review>

Fantastic movie theatre! Visiting this movie theater for the first time was a fun experience for me. Their employees have been extremely welcoming, helpful, and honest. Please believe me! You will never be unhappy with your purchase. I'm not going to look for another movie theater ever again. I'm going to come back here again and again.< /review>

It's 0.7 miles away from the red and purple line station called Civic Center/Grand Park. It's a matter of one block down and three blocks over.

A clear screen, excellent sound, and an ideal location for a movie theater. I was astounded by how much this place might have cost me if I hadn't been honest. It was a perfect fit for my budget. We had a great time at the venue and watching the films that day. To be honest, I'll tell all of my friends about this fantastic place. It's a pleasure to work with such a lovely party.< /text>

Their projection and audio equipment are excellent, and they are big supporters of Independent films, always advertised exciting trailers, types of films you would not know about otherwise. Super comfy seats, friendly and polite staff. We will come back again!< /review>

I personally liked how everything was organized inside the booth and how it gave me the feeling of being inside a tiny movie theater. The sound quality was really entertaining, and we loved the idea that every room was sound-proofed. We really had fun, and we are pretty sure that it won't be the last time! Thanks!< /Text>

My girlfriend and I were planning to go to a movie house, and one of my friends recommended this movie house for us. The staff was nice, very professional, and accommodating. Besides, the seats were organized, the whole area was cleaned, and the screen was too large and clear. Honestly, we have quality time with each other with your movie house.</Review>

They had an organ player playing classic tunes before the movie started. There also was a costume parade for the kids to show off their various Elsa, Anna and Olaf outfits (plus the one adult in costume, he got free 2 tickets for participating!). Then the movie started, singing a long was easy with the subtitles and bouncing ball over the words.< /text>

<Text>Very well-maintained theater than anywhere else in the city! This theater has a reclining and heated on their seats. There is enough parking right next to the theater during weekends and evenings. Has nice little lobby in the front and concession stand that offers every movie-goers love to have, popcorn and fries!<//Text>< Date>

There’s nothing like a private, air-conditioned room with comfy sofas to keep you compensated. They also have a private room perfect for housing your group of loud friends.</Text>< Pics>

Last Monday, my family and I came here to watch cinemas. We greatly loved how clean and comfortable their chairs are. Even the screen was big and loud to our ears. Also, the foods and the drinks that we bought tasted delicious and OK. Overall, we greatly enjoyed spending time here. Thank you. Till next time!<//text>

I've always preferred watching movies at the movie house, it's just way better here. However, we were blown away by the service. My boyfriend and I had to leave the movie due to an emergency, and the manager gave us two movie tickets to come back for free. He didn't have to do that, but he just did! I will recommend this place to my friends and family. Thank you!< /Text>

Went for a film festival.  very cool layout gets a bit stuffy and hot when the place is packed which was the night I went. But we're gladly go back to see more movies there lot of bars close by too for cool after parties.</review>

I love this place so much. One of the first LA theatres to show classic Japanese movies when they were current. Seating was comfortable as well. Great facility.< /review>

Best and freshest popcorn EVER! Not sure if it's some kind of special oil or kernel they use, but it is bomb! Reasonable drink prices as well. Great time at the theater.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><date>1508951233399< /date><Name>Melissa Morch<//Name><text>This old movie house in downtown Los Angeles has a modern lobby with features suggestive of the Art Deco period, such as a large handrail leading up the staircase to the projection booth. The small concession stand and tables provide a clean and relaxing environment to wait for the next feature.  The theatre is older and smells of popcorn but this somehow lends to the experience.  There are new, plush, seats in a center row in the theatre for the VIP and director.  This is a great theatre for movie screenings or? Date night?<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Popped in for a Friday night date- the building is very interesting in itself. The lobby is very concrete-and-glass-modern, with a small snack stand and some tables for hanging out pre-show. The theater itself is surprisingly large- chairs are comfy and the sound quality is excellent. I'd come again- price is comparable to the giant chains so might as well support something different!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The Madang mall is rising from the ashes of dead-mall-syndrome, with Downtown Independent at the helm.  A great place to see a movie , Korean or Western, with the added benefit of Korean subtitles so you know exactly what the Pacific Rim monsters are saying.  Definitely join their Downtown Independent rewards "club" -- points accumulate quickly and I'm always getting a free popcorn, pretzel or drink.  Korean movie snacks?  Check!  Select your own seat in fancy-pants stadium seating?  Check!  Daiso downstairs?  Check.  Free validated parking?  Check.  Move over, Arclight.  If the movie you want to see is at Downtown Independent, it is a hit!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Came here a couple of weeks ago for a screening of "Shotgun Wedding" and can say that this venue is fun. It caters to the independent film scene and judging by their event board, there is always something going down at the Downtown Independent and its neighboring venues. They did have alcohol available for purchase, but I wasn't sure if that was just for special events or not. The theater itself is of decent size and capacity and the sound system is good as well.</Review>< time>

A great hub for indie films and festivals. I enjoyed a drink-a-long double feature, and the crowd was as into it as I was. Bring your friends or make new ones, but most importantly, come for the films and enjoy the big screen the way the locals do: with a beer in your hand.< /review>

Projectionist forgot to switch the reel halfway through, but that only added to the experience. I will be going back for sure. $10 for a medium popcorn, water, and a Lagunitas IPA? Forget AMC.< /Review>< Pics>

I wouldn't recommend renting their theater for your next screening. The managing director (Alex) and staff are very rude, insensitive, and extremely unprofessional. The Downtown Independent decided to disrupt our partnership and cancel the event less than a month before we were suppose to screen. There reason which was cited as "arriving at the theater unannounced, with no appointment" which wasn't the case. My team had a scheduled meeting to go over logistics and planning for the event on Dec 9th. We were already downtown and I thought it would be a good idea to stop by the location so everyone could familiarize themselves with the venue.

We did not know there was an event going on, but seeing as how the venue is a public theater and the event was also public (film festival), I figured an impromptu visit would be okay. The moment we walked in the managing director greeted us with a smug look and a quick comment that we could stay in the lobby. She then made certain comments to her staff, which prompted them to give us unwarranted looks as though we were criminals.

My team and I had a brief talk in the lobby. I then spoke to Mike (staff member) and asked him if there was any way I could show my team inside the theater to take a quick look, and he told me no. I then went to speak to the host of the event,who told me it wouldn't be a problem. I then paid for a ticket to their festival as a courtesy for allowing me to go in.

As we're making our way inside, the staff member comes running and yelling from the concession stand, shouting that he already told me no and was going to ask me to leave. He ran over to the door of the theater and tried to close the door on my team. I let Mike know I had already spoken to the host of the event and paid for a ticket, and took my team inside the theater.

Then their staff went running and yelling up the stairs. One of the host of the event saw the whole thing unfold, and offered my team and I a seat due to Mike's erratic response. When we exited, no more than two minutes later, The managing director was speaking to one of the members of my team, and I explained to the managing director that I cleared things with the host and paid for a ticket. She then started telling me that I couldn't just come to the venue space without an appointment. I asked her if it is indeed a public space, hosting a public festival, why I couldn't buy a ticket and enter the theater like any other patron since they are making it such a big deal and she didn't have an answer.

By the end of the ordeal, we both agreed there had been a huge misunderstanding and that it was blown out of portion due to their staff and the way they handled everything. My team left the venue and continued our meeting down the street. I had every intention of sending a follow-up email to Alex the next morning, but instead received the news that my event was cancelled. After I requested the owners email "Jim" to make him aware of everything.

Again, I'm an indie filmmaker that wanted to host an event in hopes of raising awareness about other local artist and the homeless community. Sad and disappointed how this entire situation was handled due to the uncalled for behavior of the venue director and staff. Please whatever you do. Don't rent here.<//text>

The theater is very tiny so if you are watching a show here I recommend coming as early as possible so you can get a good seat. They have a tiny concession stand that sells popcorn, pretzels, soda and beer. They have a pretty decent selection of craft beers including Angel City & Golden Road. Surprisingly every time I've been to the theater I've been able to find a meter spot so keep your eyes peeled.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c6496dd0e54d:0x1d1a2bbdd600ca5d< /gmap_id></record>

<review>For indie movie lovers, this location is great. There are selective plush seats where you can put your feet up and enjoy films in all your glory...even better when you're the only person in the theater!

Special events are held at the rooftop, which make this a multi-functional space. Very awesome!

This is a really great place.  When most theatres are trying to show only the biggest and most overwhelmingly high budget movies and not making any room for independent film and new ideas this place is setting a mark.

The owner is a big lover of independent film, independent music and trying to smash different things together to make for really fun events.  Events like double-feature drink alongs, comedy nights and live music with visuals.

If something is on their calendar and you don't know about it.  Just go!  Chances are you will have a great time.

Oh and they just got BEER ON TAP!!!!  If the movie isn't for you then just get hammered!</text>

<Text>This is one of my favorite theatres. Besides presenting amazing films, there is a great and FREE comedy show every week, Sleepaway Camp, where top comedians and underground, upcomers share their craft! The staff is also very friendly and well informed.

Bonus: The concessions include an array of the standards plus for those interested, there are alcoholic beverages a' plenty!

Tip: The first few rows of stadium seating have extra-comfy reclining chairs.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Great theatre. I only go up here to see smaller movies that are not shown in regular theatres. Definitely a great thing to be able to watch movies that aren't available in other theatres here. Their seats are comfortable and they have decent arm rests.

They also have "VibeLights" or something along those lines that provide mood lighting to the theatre. I thought it was a neat feature though the films I have seen there have not completely utilized it.

I will definitely be coming back here as long as they keep offering the show obscure or foreign films that you cannot fild elsewhere.</Review>

<review>I bought a stove. They said they would deliver & install. He couldn't figure it out. Supposed to return, he didn't. Another guy came out & he couldn't do it either. I ended up a WEEK LATER paying my gas guy $250 to hook it up. Took him less than 5 minutes. Extremely unhappy.<//review><Resp>None<//Resp><Rating>1</Rating>< time>

Service representative "Kim" was excellent!  She went above and beyond to help me with my gardening needs.  She truly is an asset to Lowes!< /Text>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>Most Lowes are very clean and filled with knowledgeable people, plenty of carts, and a good selection of easy to find inventory. This place was a dump. Inventory scattered all over, left in piles on the floor, not faced or organized properly, and no one "available" to help, though there were plenty of staff wandering the store floor, which by the way was filthy. I'll never go back to this one. Wow.</text>< Pictures>

Tracy was super helpful.
I needed a gas dryer which wasn’t in stock, but she worked her magic and made it happen. I got it delivered the very next day.< /Text>

DELIVERY Zero Stars (Beware)
After three days of waiting and the delivery people driving around with our $4k LG fridge they came to finally deliver it. The only problems:

1) They are not very careful and slammed the wrong fridge into the pavement repeatedly trying to get the dolly adjusted—scratching and denting the bottom of the fridge. This also isn’t good for the compressor, lines, or any of the circuit boards in the fridge. They also did not cover the stainless steel doors before attempting to put the straps around the fridge.
2) When I started to walk towards them to try to talk to them about being careful with how they handle the fridge I noticed it was the wrong fridge. As it turns out they delivered our fridge to someone else and tried to deliver this one to our home.
3) They wanted to pick up the fridge that they delivered to the wrong home (probably also damaged by their level of incompetence) and deliver it to our home after I told them that I was going to return the purchase. I told them that while the constant delays and getting the wrong fridge is annoying it really is how they handle appliances that I could not accept. They did not seem to care, did not apologize, and said that they drove all this way for nothing.

We just bought it through another competitor and will never consider buying another major applied from Lowe’s until they stop using DSI for appliance deliveries.

STORE ASSOCIATE EXPERIENCE (5 Stars for Tracy)
Tracy did an amazing job helping us with our new LG Fridge purchase. The fridge was on back order due to LG shutting their factory down as a result of the pandemic with an ETA of April. Tracy took the time to make sure we understood all the features to make sure it was the right fridge for us. When she determined it was the right fridge for us she then proceeded to go over current promotions, the installation process, the benefits of their extended warranty versus some of their competitors, and even promised to make sure that she followed up with us as soon as Lowe’s received their shipment from LG. A month later Tracy took the time to personally call us, as promised, to let us know that she has our fridge 2 months ahead of schedule. I can’t say enough about the level of service my wife and I received from Tracy and only hope this reaches her since we missed the window for the survey.<//text>< Pictures>

Lowes had a tough time finding an item for me today. This isn't always the case. They are severely understaffed. The shelves are in disarray, and one of their customer service reps complained that they don't have time to straighten the shelf out. I didn't complain about it but they did! I just had a hard time looking through the stuff to find the one item we needed. I have to give them some credit for looking up in their inventory only to find they were out of that item. Thank God for cell phones!</review>

Lowe’s has been great throughout this COVID experience. They are one of the few places that haven’t had to completely change the way they work.

We were helped by Edward who was very knowledgeable of drill batteries.

They have veteran parking and a vets discount. I don’t use the parking (personal preference) and, I haven’t set up my account for the discount yet, but I appreciate their efforts.<//Review>

<Review>Layout is a little off from when you try to find something here. However, I do not to home depo everyday so as a armature to this place of course it would be hard to find something. But the staff is always willing to help and that a big plus for me since I would just be wandering the store aimlessly. Education of their stores layout and products is a big plus.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808522d27fadda01:0x776af788f7090e96</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Generally, shopping at Lowe's is fine. But I have to call them out for this. We requested to have our front door measured as we wanted to get a sturdy screen door. After 3 weeks nobody had showed up. When I called, they said the people that do that work didn't want to come so far (27 miles) so they just threw away our request. I asked why they didn't at least let us know and got the phone equivalent of a blank stare. No good answer. That's just wrong.</Text>

Placed an order for an important project and it never made it on the delivery truck. Someone canceled the order mysteriously but no notifications went out. I didn’t find out until I called after the truck didn’t show up. They apologized and said they’d get it on a AM delivery to avoid delays on our project. It’s now setup for an end of day delivery...I’ve been to other Lowe’s where everyone helpful and tried to find solutions. Here I’m only finding the word sorry without any actions being taken.</review>

<Review>Like so many others, wish I could give them a negative but that option is not available. Ben, was, by far, the worst.
He stood by watching another employee assist another customer, I politely asked if he could tell me if they had an item in stock, so he helped me. Apparently they didn't have the item, I asked if I could purchase the floor model, they don't sell the floor model. He said we could call another store, he actually looked on line, the other store had it in stock, but while I was waiting I saw the same item on the shelf already assembled, I asked if they had two floor models could they still not sell one, Ben took a deep breath as if I was bothering him. I told him not to bother I would talk to his manager. The manager wasn't in. Perhaps the color of my skin bothered him, or perhaps because I don't look like him, my parents don't look like they are first cousins. The other store he said had the item did not, I called before I drive to the next city.
If this store has 50 employees, 3 of them are pleasant and helpful.
I just purchased my house so, I will be doing a lot of shopping.

<time>1605925380888</time><rate>1< /rate><text>On November 19th, I brought a defective Kobalt hand tool to customer service for a one for one exchange.  Kobalt is their brand name and it has a lifetime hassle free warranty.  They weren’t going to exchange it because I didn’t have a receipt.  I own hundreds of hand tools which all have lifetime warranties.  By this logic, I would have to keep every receipt for every tool I own until the day I die in order to exchange one that fails sometime in the future.  In other words, if I bought one of their hand tools with a lifetime warranty and 25 years from now it breaks, they won’t exchange it without a receipt.  Who on earth keeps a receipt for the rest of their life?  This policy was explained to me by Kyle, the assistant store manager, after waiting half an hour for him to show up to customer service.  He also said I would have to call their 1-800 number to get an authorization.  He finally conceded and exchanged the tool, but firmly stated “never again”.  A “Lifetime Hassle Free Warranty”?  Not even close.</text>< Pics>

<text>On the Lowes website it said they have 14 beach umbrellas. I got to the store the associate looked and didn't find them and he looked where the seasonal items were and they weren't their either. Either they're not putting out the inventory, they have high theft or someone is not checking inventory in correctly.< /text><gmap_id>0x808522d27fadda01:0x776af788f7090e96< /gmap_id>< date>

Garbage! We ordered our roofing for our house. Supposed to be black. They sent 4 different colors. What a mess.
Took 2 weeks to get the right materials.
My house was sitting torn off roof! Just think if it would have rained. They are inept.</Text>

The staff was friendly and helpful however the washer we wanted that was on sale was back ordered and said the order was a total guess if it would even go through. We then went online and ordered it from best buy. Same model and sale price with no issue. Sounds like the ordering process needs updating.</Text>

Matt the sales floor supervisor was extremely helpful in ordering an outdoor security camera. I had a unique situation where I wanted to use a lowes gift card and a visa gift card. I was unable to process both types of transactions online. Trying to get a hold of anyone at the Vallejo location was impossible. Whenever I called Vallejo the phone would ring endlessly until someone finally picked up and placed the phone on the table. Thank you Matt!!!<//Text>

Was out shopping for refrigerators today. Went to a few places and found things we looked but nobody actually had the product in stock. Finally Went to Lowe's and found a reasonably priced unit i could have delivered in a couple days instead of weeks.</Review>

<review>I ordered two very expensive appliance items and wanted to check on the status of my order because it was supposed to arrive in a weeks time. I call their customer service line and was put on hold many times in the course of 6 attempts and transferred to many departments that didn’t ever answer (apparently they were closed) ? Only one associate was nice and polite, her name was Cece. The other woman would talk over you and seemed agitated probably from something that was going on with her prior to our phone call? So I decided to ask for her name so that I would know if I got her on the phone I could request another associate and to not interact with her any longer. I couldn’t believe how blatantly rude she was (I said nothing to her about her attitude) she just sighed and hung up on me. I was polite the entire time just trying to get to the bottom of my order and I felt completely disrespected. After being put on hold and disconnected with for the past hour and a half I just gave up! Extremely dissatisfied with the phone etiquette. I expected more polite service and decency from the Lowe’s staff. 😕</review>< response>

I came to the store to purchase an item /shed that was advertised in stock  and was told they don't have it, blame it on Covic.   I insisted and one other supervisor (Chris) came to the rescue,  he made the suggestion to check the stock and what do u know there was one more sheed available.    In my opinion Lowe's  needs to be more up to date and work more in proper customer service.</text>

<Text>The customer service gals need a little customer relations class... The one lady tried to take my cart of merchandise and restock it. I informed her that that was my items I already had purchased.  She and another co worker were extremely rude. So Back to Home Depot I go. I always try but they always let me down.

If I could give zero stars, I would. This store has abysmal customer service. Failed to deliver product 4 separate times. After the second time I called corporate and waited on hold for an hour before I was helped. After the third time I went to the store to speak to them in person (because their phone routing system sends you in endless circles). They promised they were pulling the product from their inventory and preparing it for delivery as I waited and it would be delivered two days later. I had to stand there for 1.5 hours while no one, including the employees, was wearing a mask or social distancing. The manager helping me was yawning and sneezing, mouth uncovered.<//review>

Visited the garden section with my daughter who was on a search looking for ideas for her backyard redo.  I’ve never seems a Lowe’s nursery look so bad. Dead, wilted plants everywhere... even succulents. Takes a lot to kill succulents. Waited around for someone to answer a couple questions, asked a second time, no help. Daughter finally googled a couple of things and we decided against what she was looking at. Might of been nice to have someone share some option. I’m going to chalk it up to this Covid thing, but  when going to Home Depot ( who didn’t have what we wanted either) they referred us to EL Rancho, a family nursery who was very helpful. My daughter dropped some dough there and will definitely be going back while she designs her yard.<//Text>

As soon as I walked inside I was greeted at the door, and shortly after another employee asked if I needed to help finding anything. So you can say that the customer service here is top flight.

<review>While I know this store carries almost everything, the customers service is atrocious. When I asked where an item can be located, the sales person shrugged their shoulders mumbling they didn't know.
In another trip I purchased an expensive generator and after paying was told to go back to the aisle and wait with my receipt so someone could get it off the shelf. After 30 mins of waiting and five sales members walking by chatting with other employees, i went back to customers service, demanded a refund and stated I would take my business elsewhere.  The young woman there shrugged her shoulders, said ok and I left.
Disgusted. HOME DEPOT HAS MUCH BETTER SERVICE</review></record></dataset><record>

Nice store, friendly staff and good phone app for finding items in the store. Kind of hit and miss on stocked items and it's often worth the drive across the freeway overpass to Home Depot for a lower price on the same item.</review>

Nobody likes to assist customers with finding g anything, it's like your putting them out to do their job. Not just not wanting to help but the eye rolling and deep breaths like omg really you need to know that!!!! Then they send you to a place where that item is no where to he found.  Happen to me and seen it happen to others. Then getting checked out can be another rigorous process. I really don't understand why work in an environment where people are going to ask questions and be offended when they do???. Getting worse.< /review>

Usually just fine here.  However, pick up for special orders is brutal.  You have to wait in the return line, then if your item is in the back...good luck. They took their sweet time.</Review>

No associates available for help. If you see one they go the other way. We saw three in the Garden dept and when they saw us heading that way, they scurried away like mice. Very bad. I was almost tempted to go to Home Depot but I don't support Trump lovers.</Review>

It seems being a contractor  sales person for so long led me to places just like this Lowe's. They have things you cannot get anywhere else and they are very CS oriented.  Customer service at Lowe's in Vacaville can't be beat especially at Christmas time.

Keep up the great job...</review>

<review>Great dealing with Josh and Damon in a appliances. Knowledgeable, friendly and straight up. Everything from there however, HORRIBLE!! Purchased a fridge with next day delivery and even got confirmation that it was loaded on the delivery truck. Next day got a call for 3-5pm delivery. Next call 6-8pm delivery. Next call 7-9pm delivery. At 8:45pm i decide to call them at which time I'm informed it's not coming at all. They did however ask what time I'd like it delivered in 2 days. All that and now, having talked to 4 other people that can't explain why if was on the truck it couldn't be delivered today, I'm just going to get my money back.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

<review>Lowes takes back detective merchandise and re-stocks it back on their shelfs as knew🤬  For the love of God before you put back return items in stock (please make sure all the pieces are in the package and the product ins't broken!)  This has happened to me numerous times at Lowes Vacaville. I brought it to the managers attention they don't care. I check to see if packages have been open but, most packages can close back up and look brand new. Outside of taking everything out of the package and preforming a inventory of said package and a full visual inspection of the product you will probably get broken or incomplete items.. Lowes management is lazy i shouldn't have to keep stopping a job to come back and get a replacement item.<//review>< userid>

A very nice location. Good prices, huge selection, giant parking lot, and friendly and knowledgeable staff.

Super easy to pop in and grab one thing or spend the day planning out the garden.

I've never had a bad experience at a Lowe's but this place is one of the nicer locations I've seen.<//review>

The Vacaville Lowe's is a pleasant and professional environment  The management staff and members have always been very helpful and friendly. John, AL, Dainel, and Eric are just a few names who go beyond the call of customer service. Their professionalism is a rare craft!! I shall return!

Install update: Every screw, board, and tool were purchased at Lowe's! I am a home owner, not a general contractor. This store is all about the community!</text>

<review>Bought our dishwasher from a lady that worked in the department and she was very helpful with helping us decide which dishwasher to go with and what brands were good. The prices were also good due to starting black Friday sales. The delivery and pick of old unit were fast as well and the guys were very polite.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< date>

Lowe's people here were very friendly. I called them from the road. I asked if I could stay in their parking lot in my RV overnight. They were very welcoming and told me where to park. It was the perfect parking lot since Denny's is right around the corner within walking distance. I just needed a quick place to spend the night. It's nice to know that there are other alternatives to a Walmart parking lot. I was not the only RV in the parking lot.<//text>

So glad we went here to get a Christmas tree! The employee on duty Matthew went above and beyond to help us out and was very knowledgeable and genuinely helpful to us and all the other customers. They have a good variety of other products around the store and I love checking out their garden section.< /Review>

Bought a BBQ for delivery, Vacaville store.
They missed 3 delivery dates, and delivery rarely answers the phone.
I had to drive to the store twice to set up new delivery times.
Then after I got the BBQ pellet stove, It didn't work, that happens, but then they were going to pick it up and missed the pick up date!< /Review>

<Text>At the nursery section outside, they definitely had poor customer service. I needed help locating a tree that the Vacaville Lowe's was suppose to have on hand according to their online website, but was told to look at the last three tables in back.  Wth!!!  I understand they were busy, but they could've said " if you don't mind waiting I'll be right with you or let me get someone to help you." So, I tried inside the store at the pick up counter and was told there should be three in stock.  When I explained to the pick up desk clerk that there was really no one to help/they were busy outside, she didn't even offer to get someone to help.  Last resort....I went back outside and flagged someone.  This worker didn't even work in that dept, but she at least tried to help.  She ended up asking someone else in that dept and was told they didn't have that tree in stock.   The worker from the other dept is the only reason why this Lowe's is getting one star.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<text>I like this store because it has a different selection from Home Depot. The store is large, very well lit and the sales staff are very helpful.

TYPICAL big box store ---but better than Home Depot !  Plenty of parking, good garden and patio department -- usually a good variety of flowers (though El Rancho Nursery has them beat hands down). Some employees will go the "extra mile" to provide good service --- but many are lazy and don't care if they waste your time! Be prepared to have to push for product information,  and ask for a supervisor when necessary.<//Review>

<Review>NEVER EVER let Lowes do any type of installation on or around your home. They to hire shady workers and take the money then run. Getting ready to start court paperwork or arbitration. I'm done with that place, funny thing is...Home Depot told me that they are on stand by if I need them to clean up after Lowes poor work.

UPDATE: Finally was able to work out a deal with Lowes. They came up with half of the payment...I can live with that. Still won't do any contractual agreements with them in the future.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<review>Expect to devote hours to your shopping trip. You really can't trust availability as listed online, or in their own system. This is not an issue isolated to this store -- I have had the same thing happen at stores in three different cities.

Calling in to confirm availability is no more reliable than looking online. I had to go to three of the closest stores to get the quantity of an item I needed for a project, when online  AND in their records it showed my closest store as having more than enough.
This most recent time, I was told there were a dozen of the wrenches I wanted "in the back". I waited an hour for the person looking for them to come back with one, before giving up. I left my number with the customer service rep so they could call if/when they found the wrench, but no one ever did.

A few weeks ago, three different employees and  I searched the store for a different item, again absorbing an hour more of my time than budgeted, and again resulting in me walking out without the item.

If you order online, the website lets you add the quantity you need, and go through all the motions of entering shipping and payment info, before it reduces your order to the quantity available, which frankly pisses me off. I don't want to order online from 3 or 4 different places and lose any chance of bundled shipping. Even online it wastes my time.

It's gotten so I dread needing to buy anything from them.

Employees are generally nice people.< /review>< UserId.>

Decent prices, often hard to find help. Some of the staff are more interested in avoiding customers than helping. Great selection tho, so if you're willing to find stuff yourself it's a good place to go.</Text>

It is Memorial day weekend and as a veteran (with official government issued id) I was denied a military discount... since I have not registered online with their new military tracking/ verification service. I am not interested in online shopping and when I am I will register. Government issued id should be more than adequate for in store purchase.
The Home Depot (which has all the same products/ pricing) does not play this game and honors US veterans.
I spent over $130 and should have saved $13...
If you are a veteran... Thanks for your service... and go to The Home Depot...< /Review>

I went to purchase 200' of various color 12 AWG wire and walk into the store, went to contractors desk and ask if they can send someone over to cut some wire for me... 10 minutes later I called the store from my phone and let them know I was standing there at the wire and have been waiting for, now, 15 minutes... The customer assistance said they would send someone right over... another 10 minutes later I noticed a call station at the wire location and pushed the button. Over the next 15 min the called station announced 3 times over the store intercom system
"help need in the wire cutting area" .. 6 minutes later I call Ace Hardware ask about the pricing which was 1/2 the price  and ordered my wire from Ace then left the store without ever receiving any help...<//text>

Hard to find someone to help, the cashiers have no clue as to where anything is.  Once I found someone they were very helpful and I was able to purchase what I needed.  Would be great if they had an app that would tell you where to find what you were looking for.< /Review>

Never ever again! Jeff, Daniel, Chris and Robert are absolutely useless! They are uneducated and have the worst customer service skills. How can a store be so unkind and unhelpful? I’ve never ever had such an awful experience with a store like this. Daniel, Chris and Robert are so condescending and rude. Clearance does not mean broken! This store needs to be revamped completely. I can say that Tyler was the ONLY nice person I encountered at this store. Fairfield is much better. Don’t shop here.< /text>

<Text>Picked up my online order at the store. When I got home realized the box had been opened and that there was possibly parts missing. Since it was a gas hose connection figured rather be safe than sorry. Turned around, went to the store to return it. When I got back the sales associate told me that she had seen the box has been opened, but she gave it to me anyways. Seems Lowes doesn't value their customers too much.< /Text><rating>1<//rating><user_id>111023938517567561002<//user_id><time>1532059665231<//time><gmapID>0x808522d27fadda01:0x776af788f7090e96<//gmapID>< user_name>

Your standard big box hardware/home improvement store. It's good to have an alternative to home depot in case you object to them on political grounds (their founder said he doesn't want members of a particular political party to shop there). One weird thing about this place was that the lights seemed unusually harsh and unpleasant.<//Review>

Found what we needed but they didn't have any self check put lanes open and there was one cashier open. We were in line for over 10 minutes. When it was our turn I asked if she could call another cashier because we had been waiting for so long and there were still multiple people behind us. She said their staff was limited and that she was it. I said I thought it was strange that they wouldn't value helping their customers over bringing in lawn mowers from outside and she said the guy doing that doesn't know how to cashier. She looked down and didn't speak anymore. So I didn't bother mentioning that I had seen at least 5 employees bringing in things from outside. Not to mention the sign saying they'd call more cashiers of more then 3 customers were in line. We were the 5th when we arrived, when we left there were at least 7 behind us. We left frustrated and very unimpressed.<//text>

Approxmently one week ago today I phoned my local store (Vacaville) to try to obtain a copy of my sales order for a dishwasher I purchased some time last year. You see I needed warranty repairs performed on the dishwasher and the repair person requested proof of purchase however I misplaced my original invoice thus the reason for my phone call.
On my first call a girl named Tracy (later found out to be the head cashier) answered and I requested if she would be able to get a copy of my sales order. Without hesitation she said in a negative tone  " in order for me to look that information up I need to know the exact date you ordered the dishwasher".
I told her I did not have this information that it was sometime around September or October of last year. She then said that without that information she would not be able to help me but maybe someone in appliances could  and she transferred me before I was able to say anything else.
Nobody answered in appliances and it rang back to Tracy, when she answered I mentioned that it makes no sense that you need the exact date I purchased the item to look it up. Couldn't you just look it up by my name or phone number. She responded no so I asked to talk with a supervisor. She put me on hold for two seconds and conveniently hung up on me.
I attempted to call the store back for the next 5 or so minutes with nobody answering the phone. At this point I figured that Tracy had looked at the caller ID and was not answering my phone calls. So I had my wife call at the same time and her call was answered by Tracy. I got on the phone and was hung up on again.
I was beyond furious at this point but waited 10 minutes to cool down and called again where someone else answered and I requested to talk with the store manager on duty and was transferred to Stan. I explained to Stan the situation that happened with Tracy and he assured me that he would speak with her about it and correct the issues.
Stan then asked me for my name and phone number and was able to pull up my order information right then and there (he did not even need the exact date of purchase ....shocker). He told me that since the order was over 6 months ago he would have to request it from the home office and then he could e mail me the information and it should take 2 to 3 days.  Satisfied with Stan's response I gave him my e mail address and phone number.
That brings us to today 07/19/2015. I still did not hear back from Stan so I thought I might stop in to the store to see if there was any news or if they were able to obtain a copy of the sales order.
Went to the customer service counter and "Tracy Head Cashier" was who greeted me. Instead of trying to explain the entire story to her. I simply asked if I could get a copy of the sales order from my dishwasher.
Tracy then started to ask me even more ridiculous questions (keep in mind she never once asked my name ... not over the phone nor on the in store visit)
At this point I stopped her and asked if she could pull up my information in the computer and she said that there was no way to do that. I already knew this was a lie so I again asked to talk with a manager again as I told Tracy that she was no help.
Chris the assistant manager came over and was able to pull up the information again in the computer by asking me my name and phone number. I asked if the corporate office was able to obtain a copy of my invoice and he looked at me as if he was clueless because he was. there has been no communications or notations about my previous request from a week ago.
So Chris was able to print me out something but not the actual sales order. I asked him how I can obtain a copy of this order and he said from corporate. I requested that he contact corporate as I need a copy of my invoiced for a warranty related concern. He took my information  and told me the same thing Stan told me that he would have a copy for me in 2 to 3 days.
Tracy works harder at not trying to help a customer. How difficult is it to ask for a customer's name to see if there is any information in the computer</Review>

< review>
The employes seem nice at first but its absolute putrid service. The first employe I asked help from was extremly rude and should be fired immidietly. He sent me to the absolute wrong spot and had to ask another employe who knew just as little as the first. The stores name and products have been ruined by the employes. I will never shop at that store and do not recomend the headacke' dissrespect and trouble of this lowes location.< /review>

<Text>Unbelievably bad customer service. I asked for help at the cashier because I can never find help. I needed two 2 x 4's. They were 30 feet away, I am disabled and need help, the cashier called for help 4 times, the forth time Josh, an employee came around the corner and yeld; as loud as he could, NO! The place went quite, cashier turned red. Cane and all I walked over to do I myself Josh forcefully tried to stop me with his hand....I look stright in his eye and said "If you lay one hand on me I'll have you arested" Managers tried to excuse Josh's behavior, poor managing skills. I felt bad for the cashier for being yelled at. The service is as bad as it gets. I'll never walk, or wheel chair in that store agian.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

A horrible experience at one of the worst Lowe's I have ever associated myself with. As a loyal Lowe's customer, I was offended by the lack of apathy and ambivalence to this store's dedication to customer service. I had bought a Fridgaire refrigerator from the Vacaville store, which came with a free ice maker. Once the Lowe's delivery arrived at my house, the installation tech informed me that the store had provided me the WRONG ice maker as well as the wrong connector switch. I had to go back to the store for the return which took over two hours of talking to at least 5 different sales rep to resolve this problem.

When the same installation team came back the SAME installation tech informed me that he can't install the water line system since I did not have the valve installed in the water line protruding out of the wall! To make matters worse, he denied ever coming to my house, much less giving the advice in purchasing the same connector!!!

Despite having proof of his team coming to my house twice, I decided to report this issue to the delivery team at the Vacaville store. After spending 30 minutes of hearing endless ringing, Travis, one of the sales rep working the front desk told me a representative from the delivery team would give me a call back in 15 minutes regarding my complaint. To pour salt over my wound, Travis, nor did any representative from delivery team give me a call back.

This is a perfect indicative of how much Lowe's cares about me as customer as well as their "customer" service outreach program. Congratulations Lowe's - you just lost a loyal customer. I'll be shopping at Home Depot here on out.</Text>

Went to Fairfied Lowe's to see if I could get a shower pan the size I needed. The associate that took care of me said the size I wanted was not available and that it could take a month to get. Frustrated I went home to further explore my options. I found the one I wanted at our Vacaville location. Sorry the the girl didn't  take the time to find out if there was one somewhere else.</Review>

Understaffed is the norm, and as a result I watched more than a couple people leave the store because only one poor girl working in appliances.  She did her best, but just not enough personnel.  That also equates to problems when the customer gets home with the new appliance they finally could get after waiting, and waiting, and waiting - and it needs a special adapter from a 3/4" hose to 3/8" fitting that is 'oh, not included of course.
A call back to Lowes and they actually don't carry the adapter specifically called out, they want you to instead by a whole new assembly kit for three times what you need to simply replace an existing dishwasher.  That's just a racket.
So my overall review - poor staffing, not servicing their customers and then trying to bilk you with add ons because they don't carry what you actually need to install the major appliance you bought from them.

The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because a lovely woman who worked there and helped me out in the end. I went into the store looking for a Tri Wing screwdriver. I asked an associate if they were any available and he had no clue what I was talking about. I have no problem with that as long as you can get me someone who does. He takes me over another associate who also had no idea. So instead of researching what I was looking for he flat out lies and says "we don't carry that item." I leave then go onto Lowes website and find tri wings right away. When I go back into the store I run into a woman who did everything correctly. I believe her name was MichaelAnne. She takes the model number from the website and looks up the part. There were none in Stock but she confirmed that Lowes did have the item. She also asked if I wanted to order it online. Thank you so much for helping me out instead of lying flat out in my face just to get me away.</Text>

I leave then go onto Lowes website and find tri wings right away. When I go back into the store I run into a woman who did everything correctly. I believe her name was MichaelAnne. She takes the model number from the website and looks up the part. There were none in Stock but she confirmed that Lowes did have the item. She also asked if I wanted to order it online. Thank you so much for helping me out instead of lying flat out in my face just to get me away.<//text>

The people were very scattered and took their time before helping us. We were waiting for at least 30-45 minutes for inquiring about washer machine and another 20-25 minutes looking for someone to help us load the machine.</review>

<gmap_id>0x808522d27fadda01:0x776af788f7090e96< /gmap_id><Text>Experience of ordering flooring very very frustrating.

Cons: nobody knows whats going on at that store.  Trying to turn around a rental in a month working with Lowes is not a good idea.

Went online to order with the use of chat, they could only get me four boxes.  Nobody can do a floor with 4 boxes.  They said to call the store and order.  I called the store they said no you have to come it.  I drive to the city with Lowes and the flooring the is labeled 7 days delivery on line and at the store is 10 working days when talking to the sales clerk.  Ordered it anyway a week ago.  Called to check on it today and we are looking at 3 weeks for delivery.  The only way I would have know is by calling.  My contractor in the mean time is waiting.

I was working with someone for a complete kitchen install working.  I'm not going with Lowes for that.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Terrible selection, poor customer service, stock on website is usually wrong. Went in for something that, according to the website, there were 199 in stock.  After searching the entire aisle there was no stock to be found, not even a shelf tag. You will leave this store disappointed, frustrated and without everything you wanted.<//review>

Poor customer service. All the employees were just standing around talking to each other. I needed help, but felt uncomfortable interrupting there conversations. No one greeted me or asked if I needed any assistance.</Review>

<text>Why is it when you need the plethora of employees at Lowe's, they all of a sudden disappear??? Weren't there 11 employees asking you "Can I help you find what you're looking for?" as you entered the store a few minutes ago.< /text>< Time>

I drove for 25 minutes each way because they claimed to be the only hardware store that was open according to their website and I even called on the phone to verify. The recorded message says open until 10 p.m. Monday to Saturday.  I got there at 9:06 and they were closed they need to change their hours on the phone message and on the website I wasted about an hour and a half of my time by the time I drove there and back and got gas. Very unprofessional</Text>

(Translated by Google) The employees here are very friendly and will ask if they need help. Goods partition management is very easy to find the desired items. The garden plant hall has abundant flowers and green plants, and the price is very cheap. Recommend this
