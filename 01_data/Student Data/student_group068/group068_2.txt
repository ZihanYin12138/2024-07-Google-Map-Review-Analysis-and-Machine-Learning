I’ve been ordering the same drink since I was 7 years old. I’m 21 now and I still get it, I know when something taste off since it’s the only drink I get here at jamba. They made the drink wrong, my husband went back and asked them to remake it and they did which was nice but it tasted just as bad the second time. I just left annoyed. First time just tasted like orange juice blended. Tasted like they didn’t add the vanilla yogurt or soy milk. It tasted very sour. The second time it tasted slightly better but still gross. Disappointed but not surprised. It’s just really annoying. For 8 dollars a drink you’d think the drink would at least taste like it’s made well. This is my first bad experience at jamba. Which should say a lot. So be careful ordering an orange dream machine.<//text>

After hearing about this place for years I decided to pay a visit to my first local Jamba Juice. I tried the Strawberry one and it was okay. The drink is pretty expensive even though it doesn't taste any different than blending your own strawberries with milk.

The service did seem kinda weird and unpleasant. The guy just kept staring at us when we were choosing what to get. Maybe it was just this Jamba Juice that didn't impress me but I ain't coming back to this one that's for sure.< /Text>

WORST EMPLOYEE EVER (30 yrs old, white male, blonde, "5,10" about, OVERweight, with a nose pierce) .

I received the worst service I ever received in my life. The employee didnt even have a name tag! The employee taking my order was RUDE and UNCARING. I go into Jamba Juice once a week to this location and this isn’t the first time this employee acted in a impolite manner. This employee scornfully took my order and gave obnoxious nutrition criticism on my drink choice.

After I received my order, I confronted him with my concerns. He snubs my comments and attempted justify himself by saying that this his “Personality”. He didn’t apologize or even consider his rude service. I wont be coming to this location anymore because of this employee. If you live in the area, I recommend not going to this Jamba Juice or avoiding this employee at all cost.< /Review>

Worst customer service ever!!! I tried ordering a smoothie that i get every time i go to any jamba juice and the guy that was in charge started giving me a really bad attitude saying that “they didn’t have it” When i know for-sure they do, it’s even on the website. However, his approach was rude and disrespectful. I have never experienced this bad of customer service. He kept trying to talk over me as well. Never going here again.<//text>

Seriously the worst customer service. I ordered  about $30 dollars worth of juices but they gave me a hard time over breaking a $50. If get it if I ordered one drink but are you telling me you don't have one $20 in your register? Towards the end of the day? & then they charge .25 cents for some dang water. The absolute worst Jamba Juice ever. They probably survive based on location alone, but this is one i will definitely not be returning to.< /text>

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I came a half an hour before closing and they served the man in front of me juice. Right when I walked up and started to order the cashier said the juicer was broken! I will never come here again. Don't waste your money on something you can do at home.</Review>

<review>Delicious.  They must have been out of plum sauce when we visited, but everything was amazing and served with a smile.  Currently no dine-in options available, but worth the visit!<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None</Response><text>We are vegetarians, and to just keep it simple. We went here two times continuously both for lunch and dinner.  Definitely one of the best Thai food we had.

Try any of their curries , like red, green etc. We had basil fired rice which was awesome. We took drunken noodle but it was good but not to level of other dishes. We took roti n curry , definitely very tasty but it's oily. I still give five because it's worth it.< /text>< user>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>We are vegetarians. We had lunch while visiting fort Bragg.

We ordered basil fried rice , Panang curry with a side of rice. Mango sticky rice for dessert.

We were very happy with the food that was served. Usually we are a bit picky about not having the scent of fish sauce or other broth, this restaurant honored our request.

The people who served the food were very courteous. And the owner was very helpful in suggesting few places to visit while we were around.

The restaurant is located inside a mall and has a nice ambience too.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808035f740c2d28f:0x238de921dc8d3cfc<//gmapID></record>

I love this little place! It's within the Country Store, a big old white building in the middle of downtown. Love the atmosphere, the service is great, SO MUCH FOOD, so worth a trip! It's all indoor seating but they have a "patio" that rolls over into the rest of the indoor mall. Absolutely delicious and great visit.</review>

This little gem in nestled at the heart of the Mendocino Company Store. Fragrant, delicious southeast asian cuisine is served, using fresh local ingredients. The staff is fun and friendly and the prices keep customers coming back almost as much as the delicious fare. Their Thai Iced Tea is a must try item, especially during some of the warmer months ahead. You will not be disappointed!<//review>

Service is very pleasant and personable, very prompt service and food got to me fast.  The peanut and sweet sauce was wonderful 😍.  The wonton soup was heavenly on a cold day when I wasn't feeling very well.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I don' really review any restaurants but my experience was so bad I had to vent out.

Got here today for a quick bite, it was late evening and there were only a few people sitting. I ordered pad thai at 8:10pm and got it on my table at 8:39. You got it, service was lousy, did not even ask for water.

I am a great fan of asian food, thai specially. Been all over asia and tried their cuisines so I know what a pad thai should taste like. Anyways, this dish literally killed my apetite that night, noodles were mushy over-steamed, no egg in it, no aroma of fish sauce(that is what I long for in a pad thai, at least) and to top it all, they put POTATOES in it. Yup, potatoes in a pad thai...... sorry not my thingy.

Paid for the other dish and zoomed out as fast as i could.</Review>< name>

<text>Service is ok. Food is not authentic but ok. 18% mandatory service charge is included in the bill which is NOT ok. I have never seen this in any restaurants in U.S.A. I will never come back again. The quality of the food and the service is definitely not worth 18% for tip.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808035f740c2d28f:0x238de921dc8d3cfc< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I arrived late in the day, ordered a meal and waited quite a while. Thought we made a mistake until we tasted the food. Turns out the premade stuff had run out, so the grandma made the food from scratch!!! WOW!!! And what flavor! So delicious. Thank you.</Text>

(Translated by Google) We ordered many small dishes. Everything tasted very good and we were well served. In fact, we were a bit surprised to have dinner so well in Fort Bragg.

(Original)
Wir haben viele kleine Gerichte bestellt. Alles hat sehr gut geschmeckt und wir wurden gut bedient. Waren tatsächlich ein bißchen überrascht, auf der Durchreise in Fort Bragg so gut zu Abend zu essen.< /review>

They then said i would have to wait for 10 minutes when i arrived obviously indicating that they DID NOT MAKE THE FOOD. When i got there they charged me for both burritos and i saw one of them give my order in spanish to the cook She told her the correct order too! The cook then came out later and RE TOOK MY ORDER AGAIN. THIS IS THE 3rd TIME. SHE THEN PROCEEDED TO THE TILL AND RECHARGED MY CARD FOR ANOTHER TIME.<//Text><GmapID>0x80945e365a18198f:0x4f0053f5cca309d4</GmapID>< user>

This place is my preferable site.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to that place. Whenever  I I need a good lunchon, this restaurant comes straightaway to my head. best and many types of  food and a large list of dishes.well mannered staff members, and great atmosphere. Also important, the charge is modest. I tell about this place with no hesitation.< /text>

the food is good, service is Ok. The bad thing about the restaurant is they charge the price different from the menu. what u see (price) is not what it is. when asked about it.
they say that is the old price or old menu, this is call robbing the customers . In addition they refuse to give receipts when asked. Always look at dish u order and  calculate the amount so u don't pay extras.< /review>

The staff are incredibly kind and loving, I have recommended Matilija veterinary hospital to so many people. I am so thankful for them, and the compassion they have shown towards my dogs and family. When it was time for my baby to cross the rainbow bridge Dr. Bailey and his staff made it comfortable for us, even during Covid. If Molly could give you all kisses for what you have done for her she would!</Text>

The staff are very friendly and will do whatever they have too for your companion health. They will work with any type of animal from cats, dogs, even pigs and horses.<//Review>

<Text>Being new in town, when my pup Sam had an ooen wound on his back, I needed a Vet quick. Did a little online check and decided on a local Vet with great ratings. Hours of operation showed they opened at 8am. I called several times until 8:45am with no answer. I finally decided to speak to the call service who then informed me that the office was not scheduled to open until 9am that morning. They took my number and said someone would be calling me back. When 10am rolled around and still no call, although a bit apprehensive, I called back only to be told that all of their Vets were at a conference and they could not see Sam.
They did refer me to another Vet that was Matillija Veterinary Hospital and I'm so happy they did. Not only did they chose to keep a Vet working while others went to the conference, they scheduled Sam immediately. Dr.Matt was very pleasant and patient with us and all of our questions and concerns were answered. He explained everything to us with possible options and never tried to sale us any unnecessary procedures or products! Sam had a superficial wound from scratching his sensitive skin due to allergies and the medication I was already using was enough. So with that, a quick nail trim, the bill was by far the cheapest Vet visit I've ever had and Sam was a happy boy....so were we!
Very happy the other Vets were at a conference and we ended up at Matillija Veterinary Hospital....I highly recommend them for sure.</Text>< pictures>

This place DOES NOT CARE about lost or stolen pets... If you are not a client then you are no one...my family member's dog is missing and they said if you're not a client then we dont help.. dog was not chipped and all they did was check and then tell the person to go deal with it by taking it to a shelter, took no info. Didn't make sure that the pet wasn't stolen or hurt.Ventura county animal services will come pick up pets that are lost, but these ppl couldn't be bothered to make sure a lost and scared pet would be reunited with its owner... they claim they have no space to 'store' animals but are a clinic to care for animals? that's nonsense.. since you can call someone to come pick it up day of... but you dont have room for a few dogs that'll leave that day? RIGHT. I wish zero stars was possible.</Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Dr. Bailey is so attuned to animals, a gifted dog whisperer, as they say. He is so gentle that even my unusually skittish chihuahua let him stroke and hold her on first sight - which is impossible for anyone but me. My German Shepherd seemed to understand Dr. Bailey would help him and submitted without question. A great veterinarian.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Was not able to actually see a veterinarian at this poorly run facility as the inept individual at the reception counter failed to actually check me in even after i approached the counter signed in with my and pets name and was acknowledged as checked in.  She should find a less challenging position to better suit her limited needs.  The only reason for the one star is because to post you cannot give a zero.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I took my cat who was poisoned in to see Dr. Bailey. I requested testing for poison but instead he sent for routine blood tests which I didn't even get results for until days later after my cat had passed away..I felt helpless and It was SO heartbreaking. When I asked what had poisoned my cat they said he never ran ANY tests for poison despite me ASKING for that specifically! Not to mention during the appointment with my dying furbaby, Dr bailey was cold, heartless and flippant about his condition. Dr. Bailey showed absolutely no urgency whatsoever in regards to the situation. He didn't seem to care when I informed him my cat was dead either and I chalk this up to negligence and irresponsibility. I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO DR.BAILEY. Never ever.  If I could give this negative stars I would but most of all I would like to warn others against seeing Dr. Bailey.< /Text>< Pictures>

I was about to give up on Western Dental.  Moved cities and found the best dentist ever.  She did things I didn’t think were possible.  Other dentists never even tried.  Thought I would of had to pay thousands.  My experience at this Western Dental was wonderful.</Text>

The wait times here are just so ridiculous. Even when you come to your appointment on time or even early you still have to wait 2 hours or more to get attended. This has happened every single time I have a appointment.<//review>

Hope they will be treated same way  always and everywhere<//Review>

I had a excellent appointment today with my 1st time visiting this office. I went for my six month check up,  Everyone in office was professional, engaging, detailed and friendly. They walked me through step-by-step what the process would be, how long I would be there and what services I would be receiving. The environment was very friendly, comfortable, spacious and inviting. The Dr. was clear in communication, of what to expect & very patient. Great experience  & they earned their 5 stars.</review>

<text>WASTE OF TIME. THEY DO NOTHING. The first and the last time I visit this clinic. I scheduled a cleaning with them and only got a look at my xrays and was told I had to reschedule for my cleaning. I waited 2 hours for them to tell me i had to come back because they had other patients waiting. I am also a patient who is waiting and to be turned away is a complete disrespect of my time. The dentist was just sitting in the hallway on his phone for an HOUR. In that time I could have had my cleaning done. When they asked him if he’d be able to do my cleaning today he told them to reschedule me. Save yourself the time.</text>< pics>

DO NOT GO HERE. I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I waited 3 hours for NOTHING. I made an appointment to see if I would be a good candidate for Invisalign. After waiting for an hour, the orthodontist spent literally only 1 minute with me- she checked my teeth for a second and said my teeth were healthy. After telling her I was interested in Invisalign, she said I would have to go somewhere else for that. They could have just told me that when I called to make the appointment. I also made an appointment for same day teeth cleaning after seeing the orthodontist. After waiting another two hours after my scheduled appointment, they finally called me in. They took SO MANY x-rays and pictures of my teeth and then took me to a room where I sat for half an hour before someone came to talk to me. Then, another person came to poke my gums. Then, they said I need $1000+ trays to prevent gum disease. After all of this, they didn't even clean my teeth. After making me WAIT for so long, the only dentist that was there to clean my teeth was asked to DO HER JOB but she refused to clean my teeth because she wanted to leave for the day. My parents also went around the same time as me and they had to wait 3 hours to get NOTHING done. We wasted our Saturday spending 3+ hours at the dentist that did nothing for us. They just spoke to us and tried to get us to spend a total of $10,000 (after insurance!!!). The staff is so unprofessional. They asked me to choose a primary insurance and when I did, they said I can't use that one as the primary and then they chose for me. Umm..what??? One of their friends walked in and they took her in right away, even when she said that she didn't even make an appointment ahead of time! Many people were complaining about the wait time and some even left and canceled their appointment! (Something I should have done.) Their office is also small and very dirty/dusty. Save yourself the time and headache and go somewhere else! Please warn others also!! Such a waste of time.</Review>

My wife went in and asked if they could see her for an emergency,  was told yes, after 5 hours waiting with an emergency was told “doctor can no longer take you. Come back in 4 days...”

Had taken my daughter to her appointment for 3pm it has taken until 5:30p.m. They over book the doctor then make you pay the price waiting

My wife had also scheduled a cleaning and had to wait 1 1/2 hours for her appointment after checking in. Why not book later? Terrible.

Billing personnel had no idea what the proper charges were, completely confused, even listing procedures that weren’t needed, confusing patients files. Charges changed 3 times for the same procedure. What a chronic pathetic service plaguing their business, with leadership so bad, nothing gets corrected, or even worse the negligence even noticed.

Doctors reply to the problem, “Sorry, I don’t book patients.”

Let me also mention that the xrays we came in to take two weeks ago weren’t good enough so we had to do the entire thing again

Not only THAT believe it or not the diagnosis changed completely.

As an Insurance broker I do NOT recommend this place for ANYONE. What a waste of time.<//Text>

<Text>Do not go to these people. You will be dealing with the most unprofessional, insufferable staff in your life. They rescheduled my wisdom teeth removal once after messing up the paperwork for sedation, failed to give me an appointment card for my next appointment, let alone a time or date to show up, and wouldn't even print our records when we asked for them. Go somewhere else and see people that actually care about you, not these insufferable fools that only exist to waste your time.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1567624146689, 'text': 'Flann Schmidt, we apologize for the service you received, we assure you we only aim for all of our patients to receive the best experience possible.

And if you are considering braces, keep in mind the orthodontist only works on Saturdays. They say she is there on Fridays as well but when you try to schedule a Friday appointment she is never there.

Do NOT use this practice!!!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80e82ece23056449:0xd9bac3ce7cc19482</Gmap_id></record>

Not very often where you walk into an establishment and instantly feel welcomed and treated with the utmost respect.
That is excacly what I have experienced each visit with Weatwrn Dental & Orthodonics.
Aaron, Alma,  and especially Ana all did there very best In enduring the best possible visit.  If you have Dentical don’t risk going anywhere else.
I’m getting all my fillings done at once rather than going multiple times to nearby dentical offices!  Can’t get any better than that!
Run don’t walk to your nearest Western Dental & Orthodonics location today! 💯/💯</text>

Let me just start by saying, before I went to western dental, I went to bright now in Simi valley. Never have I EVER been treated so badly in my whole life by a dentist. He was rude, and pretty much made me feel like a horrible person for crying, and by the way he cracked my top tooth, while pulling my bottom. And there was Ana, she was like a angel. I was honestly so thankful for her. She helped me through that traumatizing experience. So a few weeks later, I went to western dental (I'm in the process of getting dentures, so I've needed a lot of work done) and there she was Ana was there. and I got this butterfly feeling. I knew I was going to be okay with her there. Its been 5 months since I've been there and ana has treated me not only like a friend, but she has helped me through this whole process. I was so scared coming to western. But ana made everything better and easy.  I thank god for putting her in my life everyday. Im not scared of the dentist anymore, because of her. Thank you Ana for being the best ever! ❤< /Review>

They are always friendly and this firm more affordable than some other dental offices. I don't usually have to wait long and the dentist is always thorough in explaining what needs to be done.
Maybe the issue begins with the customer... afterall you get what you give and if you're rude, well, all they have to guarantee is that they will do their job and provide customer service. They don't have to stand abuse from rude, demanding, late patients, or clients that don't keep their kids in-check.
My only wish is that their periodontist be available more than once a month.</Text><rating>5< /rating><username>JA B</username>< pictures>

Omg its such a hassle trying to communicate with anyone for anything from rescheduling an appt or understanding bill charges. My calls are usually 10 mins long before i decide to hang up and that alone is so annoying.  This call center needs individuals who actually understand the customers' requests, who know how to listen and comprehend or just get rid of it, its never been helpful anyway.

I went in last Tuesday because of a chipped tooth. I hadn't been to the dentist in 5+ years so wasn't surprised to find out I needed some major work. I was able to get all the work done in an easy payment plan. From receptionist to Endodontist and everything in between, the staff was extremely helpful and kind. Amy, Amir, Carlos, Bianca, and Dr. Dio are just some of the people I've encountered. I'm only halfway done with all the work but looking forward to going to them for the rest.<//review>

If I can only rate this as a NEGATIVE 5 star I would! I had a toothache last year and they had the next appt avail.  After getting an assessment completed they scheduled a follow-up appointment to see what my insurance will cover.  Once they let me know how much I had to pay out-of-pocket I decided to decline their service. I then got another dentist take care of my tooth ache in the meantime.  Not even a month later I received a bill from Western dental.  I immediately called the office to dispute the invoice and they confirmed that the appt was canceled and closed the account.  Two weeks later I received a letter from the collections department notifying me that they were going to hit my credit if I do not pay my bill!!! I then immediately called the department and notified them that this is all incorrect. They called the office and everything was confirmed that it was an error and supposedly cleared my account.  Here we are almost a year later by next month to learn that my credit has been affected by their incompetence and is now reflecting as bad credit!  Trying to get this all cleared has been a nightmare and worse than a toothache since every time they state it's taken care of and it's FALSE.  I'll be reporting this to the FTC and make everyone aware of their fraudulent act!!!</Text>

I had the worst kind of experience in western dental. I went to filling and they told me that they have to do the filling for $ 270 for something.Mde me paid 90 and I supposed to go for the next two appointment. I cancelled the appointment and they still charged me.I refused to pay of course.This is the worst service. And due to the first filling it hurt me very bad. And still they asked me for $270 🙄🤦‍♂️<//Review>

I went to the office in Simi Valley they are liers they told me they got all the work approved with my insurance so I did the work come to find out from my insurance company they didn’t get the work approved. Had a conference call with my insurance company and the corporate office of western dental and they  lied to my insurance company and  she called them out and told me not to pay them don’t go to this dental office they will tell you that you need work that you don’t need< /Review>

< Review>
Nice park! Just spent an hour cleaning up after someone's kids birthday party. How unfortunate. Shame on you!</Review>
<response>None</response></record>
</dataset><record>
<text>This park has a great play structure my kids really enjoyed and a shady bench I could sit and watch them. Along with that it also have a covered bbq area, horse shoe area, volleyball net, drinking fountain, and ample grass area. I only gave 4 stars because unfortunately there are no restrooms so having a bbq and staying for an hour or two is unrealistic. Also there is a field/ally with garbage littering it. Thank goodness my boys didn’t notice it because I’m sure they would have attempted to go exploring it. It seems to go far past the next street maybe? Does not look safe.</text><user_name>Dijana Marina< /user_name><date>1538509983204<//date>< response>

It shows open 24hrs on Google. But when i arrived there was no lights on @ around 7pm... Would be great if they put some light pole with a switch timer like back in the days...< /review>

I really feel Welcomed there & relaxed,  Which makes me feel that God's Presence is there and He's Happy watching Everyone there Worshipping him from Our Hearts. I Always come out of the Worship with a Smile on my face & a weight that has been lifted OFF my shoulders.  A Peaceful Feeling is one Way to describe it!  PRAISE GOD!</text>

Good place for fried chicken.  The chicken wing meal comes with plenty of chicken wings and side dishes.  Asks for separate sauces (2 kinds) to keep the wings crispy.< /review>

The food here is meant to be shared, and the portions are generous.  The setting is very casual with K-pop playing on the television.  The service is quick.  There aren't really any vegetarian options outside of french fries and sweet potato fries.  We went with a party of 5.  We split an octopus dish with a side order of sweet potato fries.  It was enough food for the table, but the prices were higher than what I would've expected for a casual spot.<//Review>

Good portions for groups. Cozy ambiance. Chicken was marinated and cooked well. We've been back three times. However, they do not check IDs, as I saw a group of young Koreans being served soju. Not sure about the ages, but the law applies to all.</Text>

They serves decent Korean fried chicken.  The sauce is a bit too sweet in my opinion, but the chicken is nicely marinated.

One thing to watch out for is that their menu is not really for folks who eat alone (the portions are too big for one guy).<//text>

Really enjoyed the BBQ cheese with chicken. It was nice and spicy. We got it to go and they didn't melt the cheese for us (intending us to do it at home), but we just ate it that way. It was great.< /review>

Really good Korean chicken place. The chicken with cheese (even though it looked weird) was actually really good. It was cheesy and spicy and two of us devoured the whole thing.
The fried chicken was also good although it was a little too bony and not enough meat.

They have an alright soju selection and the service can be a little improved. The servers are not educated about the menu/restaurant but hopefully that can improve over time.<//Text>

I haven't had the friend chicken here, but the Bibimbap and Tofu Soups are really, really good. Standard pricing at around $12-13 per dish. The service staff are really responsive and fast and friendly. My favorite part is the TV that loops K-pop music videos haha. A trendy looking place.</text>

<review>Korean Fried Chicken FTW! I'm a big fan of korean fried chicken(being korean) and was intrigued when I found this spot. I always get an order of wings for $20 and you are allowed to choose 2 different flavors. Chicken comes out crispy and juicy and the pieces are quite big. Their "spicy" isn't really spicy, tastes similar to their regular sauce. Garlic Soy is also a good choice.< /review>< Date>

The chicken here is delicious! We had the fried chicken and grilled octopus. The chicken was perfectly cooked, super tender and crunchy. The octopus was just a little tough. Don't think I would get the octopus again. We also got some cocktails which included their "Screw-ju" which consists of a small glass pitcher filled with  Soju and a flavored popsicle to stir into it.  Added benefit is the k-pop videos playing on every TV in the place.<//text>

Quality of chicken has been steadily declining over the past year. However still one of the best places for Korean chicken and beer.< /Review>

In A Nutshell:

-Hoolala Chicken was a great find, during late night out hanging in downtown Sunnyvale.
-The $30 ramen was the perfect drunk food, enough to feed (4-6 people).
-The ramen is a Korean concoction made with all the unhealthy items you can find at home and tossed together.
-The ingredients found here were:  ramen noodles (had to order a 2nd b/c one packet was not enough), kimchi, Spam, chopped hot dogs, won tons and garaetteok (cylinder-shaped rice cakes).
-Very spicy, but accomplished the task of getting full.

Overall, I guess I'd stumble back here again if I found myself in the area, but it's not a place I would plan to eat at.  So just A-OK.< /Text>

Seriously the best service you can get in Vallejo. The guy is totally transparent. He threw in a free screen protector and he literally showed me the problem and how to fix it. Great price. I would definitely go there again and 10/10 recommend this shop over any in Vallejo and trust me I’ve been to a few I’m not very good to my phones</Review>

We had a great experience getting a iPhone screen fixed. The owner was extremely efficient, friendly, speaks perfect Spanish, and fixed the phone so quickly. Will definitely be coming back for our phone needs.</Review>

< Review>
Highly recommend, extremely professional and knows exactly what he is doing for the lowest price in Vallejo . I came in needing my camera on my iPhone replaced to continue to record videos and memories of a dog I have that’s getting older, got it fixed the day I needed it no problem. 100% will return . Thanks again, also, as far as I know,, this is the only place I’ve found that replaced a busted back of an iPhone .< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>If we could give more than 5 stars, we would!  We were immediately impressed with Dr. Lanzon when we had our virtual consultation with him for our son’s wisdom teeth extraction procedure.  He was so kind and calming and legitimately seemed to care.  Then came the day of surgery.  Dr Lanzon was still so calm and kind and professional and he walked us through every detail and made sure that we were very comfortable with everything that was going to be going on.  He was very thorough, both before and after the procedure.  Our son’s recovery has gone incredibly smoothly and it was evident that Dr. Lanzon did an amazing job.  His skills are clearly unmatched.  His bedside manner is an unbelievable bonus.  We would recommend him (we HAVE recommended him) to everyone we know. 😊 It’s so rare to find such amazing care.  We are very grateful for Dr. Lanzon.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Dr. Lanzon and Staff are the Most compassionate and sympathetic people that I have ever encountered.
I would like to Thank them for making me feel like I matter.
They don’t just listen they actually hear what it is you’re saying and do their best to bring you comfort and ease your skepticism. I would highly recommend anyone that is in need of Oral Surgery, look no further than this office.
Thank You Dr.Lanzon and Staff Thank You so Very Much.</text>< name>

I have had four implants done by Dr. Lanzon and he is the very best! From the moment you step into his office you are treated with kindness and professionalism. His staff is very competent and helpful. Dr. Lanzon is always so wonderful. He goes over every detail of your procedure so you understand completely. He makes the implant procedure just about pain free! Outside of the initial numbing injection, you really don’t feel any other pain. He continues to ask how you are feeling throughout. He personally calls to check on you in the evening after your procedure. I would recommend Dr.Lanzon to anyone! He and his staff are stellar professionals and I wouldn’t go anywhere else!!</Text>

<Review>I’m terrified of going to the dentist but Dr. Jesse Lanzon made me feeling comfortable with my visit. He explained what was going to be done to me and is very knowledgeable. He helped me understand the procedure as well with showing me pictures to get a visual on what he was describing. I would 100% recommend people to go to him he is awesome.!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Best experience I have had with a family member getting their wisdom teeth pulled.
I have gone through other Dr's with 3 other family members. Dr. Lanzon is professional and has a wonderful staff. He is very thoughtful and caring of his patients. Will be bringing other family members.< /review>

< Review>
I hadn't been to a dentist in a very long time.  My extreme fear kept me away.  Over time I knew I needed major dental work done. I was scared,  embarrassed,  and petrified.
I can't say enough about Dr. Lanzon and his wonderful staff. I went in for a consultation,  and I walked out with a plan for my dental work,  and complete confidence. I had to have dental surgery,  I was so impressed,  staff was patient, friendly and so compassionate.
Dr. Lanzon did such a wonderful job,  and I had minimal pain. For someone who had complete fear, I am now following my specific plan to keep my smile healthy and happy!<//Review>

<Review>Dr. Lanzon has provided the best care in installing three separate implants and extractions. He takes great care to make sure your are as comfortable as possible. He will adjust his work and go at your pace.

I highly recommend Dr. Lanzon for any implant work. I can be contacted if anyone wants more details.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I actually saw Dr. McAninch in Lompoc. Throughout the process of removing a tooth and posting it, he's been wonderful. Great chair-side manner, and great aftercare, though I had virtually no pain or swelling. Wonderful and responsive office staff. I'd highly recommend the Lompoc office.</Review><gmapID>0x80e83713553007d9:0x98d0d251c29707a8<//gmapID>< Pics>

When it comes to the emotional & physical well-being of our child we found the best! Dental procedures (especially when sedated) are stressful for the parents & child.

Dr. Lanzon is honestly the best there is. He shows his patients genuine kindness and has the best bedside manner. He is always super responsive and makes it a point to address all of my questions and concerns. He is also charismatic, funny, and compassionate. One thing I’ve learned about Dr. Lanzon is that he truly cares about his patients. For example, any time I have a problem he goes out of his way to meet with me as soon as possible. Dr. Lanzon carefully listens to his patients and makes it his priority to fulfill their wants and needs. Every time I see him it is an absolute pleasure. I seriously wouldn’t trust anyone else to do as amazing of a job as he did. There is a reason this man has all five star reviews! I wholeheartedly trust Dr. Lanzon, and that is saying something if you know me. (:

Itzel has been absolutely wonderful, too!<//Review>

<review>Had two implants put in.    From start to finish was treated with excellent care and Dr. Lanzon was always sensitive to my well being.    I must say he was one of the politest dentist I’ve ever met.     They all worked hard  making you feel comfortable and did there jobs with true professionalism.  Regarding financial they worked with me so I could afford the procedure.     You won’t be disappointed if you have to visit his office.

The staff is exemplary. The entire process, scheduling, and in my case rescheduling was done very kindly and with much patience. Prior to our meeting, Dr. Lanzon discussed my case with my oncologist in reference to dental procedures after radiation. After examining that evidence and a new X-Ray, he took his time and very carefully explained in detail what he felt were the best options.  I truly appreciate his expertise and counsel. We have another appointment in about 6 weeks and I am looking forward to it.
With much respect,

Dr Lanzon is a great doctor - I don’t think you could find a kinder more compassionate and competent individual.  His office staff is great also!  Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting and being treated by Dr Wong, another great doctor.  Having ones teeth worked on is not at the top of my list of fun things - but they all made the experience as good as it gets.  My sincere appreciation to all at their office!< /Text>

I first went in for wisdom teeth removal. It was my first time doing any type of surgery and I must say Dr. Lanzon did an amazing job!! Before I knew it the surgery was over and I didn’t feel a thing. Would definitely recommend going here. The staff make you feel welcomed and relaxed and don’t hesitate to give you a call to check up on you. 5 stars all around for this dental office!< /review>

Dr. Lanzon is AMAZING! He is thorough in explanation of treatment, gentle, soft spoken and very kind. When he’s in surgery he’s only focused on the patient and their comfort. He explains post surgery instructions before surgery and to the person taking you home. He calls a couple times to check on you at home too. If anyone needs an oral surgeon for yourself or a family member I highly suggest Dr. Lanzon you won’t be disappointed.< /text>

Dr Jesse and his staff are the best! He has gone way beyond the call of duty to take care of me. He made himself available 24/7 when I suffered a debilitating tooth infection while traveling in Europe. He is kind, compassionate, easy to talk to and above all; a great doctor. I know that I wouldn’t have gotten through all the complications so well without his care.  I trust him implicitly and consider myself very fortunate to have him as my doctor.< /Text>

Dr. Lanzon has an amazing bed side manner, kind personality, professional prowess and truly cares about his patients. This was my first surgery and although it be dental, it was scary. Dr. Lanzon and his team were extremely professional and helpful for my wife and I through pre and post operation. If I ever need an oral surgeon again, I will definitely only go to Jesse.</text>

< Review>
Dr. Lanzon and his staff are excellent - knowledgeable, trustworthy and caring are the three words I would use to describe their services. I would highly recommend Dr. Lanzon for any dental work that you may need.

To give you and idea of what I experienced for my procedure, here is a summary:

My teeth, mostly due to genetics and a love of sugar, were starting to get past the point where they could be saved and rather than keep fixing them one at time for the rest of my life, I made the decision to remove them and replace them with upper and lower implants. This decision was not an easy one but one that was necessary.

With the help of Dr. Lanzon and Dr. Oquist (my dentist), we worked out a treatment and replacement plan that would have the most chance of success. Nothing is guaranteed with this type of major dental work but, after several consultations with Dr. Lanzon, I was confident that he could provide the expertise needed for this "upgrade". And I already knew and trusted that my dentist, who would be coordinating the final appliances (teeth) that would be attached to the implants, was well versed in the process as well. So even though I had no idea what to expect, they did - and their confidence helped to prepare me for what was to come.

First step in the process was to remove my lower teeth, but because I was unsure of how I would react to the removal of my teeth, I decided to just remove half and let the necessary bone grafts become established. In looking back, I should have taken their recommendation to have them all removed at once but to their credit they worked with my two-step plan so that I would feel more comfortable. It turned out that they were right, and that my decision resulted in having to endure one extra healing process (about two months) that could have been avoided had I taken their advice. So the lesson learned here was to accept their advice!!

A few months after this first removal of teeth, I had the remaining lower teeth removed. After pulling the teeth, five implant posts were added. Then a temporary fixed denture was fabricated to fit the posts and attached. All of this was done in a one day session and I was under anesthesia for the entire time so I had no idea what was happening and no pain. When I left his office that day I had new bottom teeth, temporary but impossible to tell that they were not real.

The healing process was brutal for the first few days with lots of rest and enough pain pills to survive. I could not eat normally so it was milk shakes, smoothies, applesauce and mashed potatoes for about a week, and then small sliced up food that could be soft chewed for the next two weeks. After that it was back to normal for food but still staying on the less chewy side of foods so that the healing and strengthening process could continue. Six months later, I had the upper teeth removed, five implant posts were added and then a temporary denture fabricated and attached. Same healing process although the upper implant procedure caused much more swelling than the lower but recovery time was about the same.

Six months after this, we started the process of fabricating the permanent teeth to fit the now sturdy posts. It took a few tweaks to get the teeth just right but once completed they were attached to the posts and have been attached ever since.

Now almost two years after starting the process, I have a perfect set of teeth and a beautiful smile :-)

I am happier, definitely healthier, and all thanks to Dr. Lanzon and Dr. Oquist. I highly recommend them whether you are just doing a small procedure or going for a complete dental replacement. They are well qualified, but more importantly they care about you and your smile. If I had to do it over again, I would choose them and am happy to recommend their services to anyone who is in need of excellent dental care.

I had the greatest experience getting my wisdom teeth removal with Dr. Lanzon and his team. They were all so nice , talked me through eveything, and made sure I was comfortable. The first time going under anethisia can be really nervewracking but they did eveything they could to ease my nerves. Thank you Dr. Lanzon and team, you were great!</review>

I was a bit nervous thinking about getting an implant. But all that went away immediately upon meeting Dr. Lanzon and his All Star staff. First off Dr. Lanzon is amazing. He is friendly and knowledgeable and has a great smile. He really listens to your concerns and does a fantastic job of answering all of your questions. His confidence in what he does and the manner in which he speaks to you makes you feel safe and right at home. I really trust him.
The office is beautiful and to be honest, I love everyone that works there. They are Friendly, greet you by name as you walk in, extremely Helpful, and Caring. Thats what His office is all about!! Go and see him, You will be glad that you did. They really did a great job with me. I recommend going and seeing him!! 😊</Review>

I had to see Dr. Lanzon for a cracked back molar. I had alot of anxiety going into the office. I can not say enough  how amazing Dr. Lamzon and his staff is. They took so much time with me to explain everything  that was happening.  They answered  every dumb question  that I had  and  did not rush the consult. We did the  extraction  right after the consult. I can not thank Dr. Lanzon enough  for there was no pain. I had alot of shots and did not even flinch.  My tooth fractured during the procedure,  but because  of Dr.Lanzom incredible expertise  he got the tooth out with no pain. Thank you Dr. Lanzon for your kindness and patience  with me. You and your staff are the best.< /Review>

<review>Dr. Lanzon and his staff are the dream team and a huge blessing to have in the community. I was in a lot of pain & came in for an emergency dental procedure. Thankfully, they were able to squeeze me in the same day I called. I ended up having complications afterward that landed me in the ER (complications that were out of the dentist's control), but Dr. Lanzon and his staff were extremely helpful, comforting, & present during the whole process. Dr. Lanzon went out of his way to perform a surgery on me at the hospital and also showed up each day to check on me and how I was healing. It's also important to note that I am TERRIFIED of dentists because of previous traumatic & painful experiences getting dental work done but Dr. Lanzon is the first to give me hope that not every dental experience has to be painful or traumatic. I would recommend him to anyone but especially to those who are particularly anxious & afraid about getting the tougher dental work done.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>2 teeth pulled and 2 bone implants done. Never felt a thing, possibly nodded off for a few Zzzs near the end, with the help of his magic gas!
I will recommend Dr. LANZON for oral surgery to everyone!
Thank you for making my visits a fantastic experience!

Dr. Lanzon is great! I was very nervous about getting a dental implant. They did a great job and I wish I had done it sooner.<//Review>

He was efficient and fast, making an unpleasant visit more than bearable. While I still dread dental visits, it will not be because of Dr. Lanzon.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I’ve always received great service from this storage facility. It is clean and the manager lives on site which is reassuring to me. There are not people hanging around and living out of their units like there are at some places I’ve checked out. I recommend this place if you’re looking for a place to keep your stuff.</Review>

Extra Space Storage is a great place to store your precious items. It is clean, well protected and the people there are friendly and efficient. They were informative when we needed to remember to but a little insurance in case something happened. They went through everything step by step and got us a unit size we wanted and didn’t try to upsell. I will highly recommend this place to my neighbors and friends who find themselves needing a place for their “stuff”.</text>

This place is a hidden gem. Very clean and easy to get to and from any directions.
Tammie helped me to get this storage from start to finish in 5 minutes. Yes, 5 minutes took me to sign everything over the phone.
I’m so happy I found this place. Headache free storage and all kind of supplies also available right there in the office for purchase. Very safe and quiet place.
Thank you very much guys.
You made everything so easy and I do appreciate you a lot.<//text>

I want you all to know I just experienced one of the Best Customer Service experiences I’ve ever had.

We are relocating to another state and needed to clear out our storage unit. Tammie was so sweet and caring taking care of us on a Sunday afternoon. They even sell all the moving supplies you need at a competitive price.

I highly recommend this location for your storage needs and ask for Tammie.

Thank you Tammie.<//text>

<Review>Thank God for Tammie! I can’t say enough great things about the level of customer service she provided me today. I was harried, panicked, with movers and all my earthly belongings in a rental truck...pulled up to my new unit at 6:00 (when the office closes) - only to find my unit was locked!  Tammie stayed after to make sure I was taken care of. If I could give her ten stars, I would. As a working professional, I’d recommend Extra Space put Tammie Geter on the fast track to leading the corporate QUALITY training program.< /Review>< pics>

Tammmie was a great experience for my boyfriend and I. We enjoyed the customer service we received from Tammie. She was very kind and new what she was doing. She showed us two unuts and made the first unit just perfect. Thank you Extra Space Storage bringing Tammie to Rancho Cordova.</text>

Initially, the staff was super helpful and gave us a good deal. HOWEVER. About 10 months into our contract, our storage unit was broken into TWICE in a single day. The entire process has been a nightmare. The employees were disinterested and unhelpful in every way, even though at least 3 other units were robbed on the same day. They did not respond to police requests for security camera footage. Footage was requested multiple times and they NEVER handed it over. They weren't apologetic in the least. My partner and I are low-income and EVERY VALUABLE THING WE OWNED was taken from us. Extra Space didn't bat an eye. They couldn't have cared less. The break-in happened almost 6 months ago and we have yet to receive any compensation (granted this is the fault of the insurance company, but it was delayed because Extra Space was uncooperative). We cancelled our lease as soon as the contract was up. NOT TO MENTION they raised our rates only WEEKS after the break-in happened after being assured they would not go up. Also the gate is broken half the time and security is a joke. LOOK ELSWARE. If they give you a deal it's because they're desperate. Don't take it.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1563036580720, 'text': "Hi Abbey, we're glad Kristina was able to help!

Was ok in beginning but they have continued to raise prices every quarter, we are now paying twice what we started at in the last 3-4 years. Actively looking for a new storage place now. Plus at one point the interior units had a bat problem. Yes, the flying kind.< /Review>

I was lost on the web when I clicked something else that took me to Extra Space.  I hung up & tried again because I thought it was my fault.  She was friendly so I decided to check it out anyway.   What a happy glitch!  A few phone calls and, between Kristina & Johnny, all my storage needs were met.  Professional & efficient but fun & funny at the same time!  Sold!!!  Space reserved & held a few days til i could get there.  In their follow-up calls I felt no pressure.  When I went to do the paperwork the laughter continued.  Another reviewer mentioned feeling like family.  I felt like an old friend & I know this will be a great experience for me.  Thanks for making it easy and very welcoming!< /Text>

Great experience getting checked in and set up with Kristina. We looked at a couple sizes to determine the right layout for storing my sectional. They were both clean. I went with the 10'x10' as it was an internal unit and was much cooler than the exterior. I bought my own lock, moving carpet & plastic sheeting to cover the sectional. When it sold & it was time to be removed, Kristina was also helpful in offering a dolly & made sure the buyers/visitors had an easy exit (she kept the gate open and stayed since my gate code became void after checking out). I would use this facility again.<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I have never needed a storage facility untill recently and Extra Space Storage was recommended by several people  local to the area. I was completely unsure of what to expect, however, their employeeJohnny made the process easier then I could have hoped . My belongings were comming in a semi truck,  so I needed a unit that I could drive up to to empty the trailer. Extra Space Storage was one of the only facilities able to accommodate this. They have a code controlled entry exit point, as well as 24 hr on-site staff. There are many size units available, and many opportunities for discounts and reduced cost among those choices. Johnny was versed in his inventory and simplified my needs to the few units and cost I was in search of. My  unit is a larger, three door unit, accessible from both isles. One large rolling door on one side, two regular doors on the other. You need to bring or purchase locks for all doors. The unit was clean and well kept. I feel safe and secure that my belongings will be will be kept Safe, dry, clean, and accessible for the duration of my storage. I highly recommend and rate Extra Space Storage in Rancho Cordova for your storage needs.</review>< Pics>

<Review>I'm moving to the area and needed a storage facility. I called this facility and Johnny answered the phone. What a great employee and help he was! He took the time to understand what I needed, make sure my reservation was set, and go over the next steps with me. I was able to do a remote contract and he even followed up with a phone call to let me know all had gone through.
I'm hoping the rest of my time with Extra Space Storage is the same.
Thank you Johnny!!</Review>< pictures>

Johnny and Kristina saved our lives! We were in a bind as the escrow of our new home did not close on time. We still had to move out of the sold  house. We walked into Extra Space Storage, one hour before closing, and these 2 could not have been nicer. They figured out the most economical way we could store our whole houseful of stuff, short term. This was a huge relief! Thanks guys! I wholeheartedly recommend Extra Space Storage.< /Review>

Stopped in today to rent a storage unit. We were unsure what size would be best. Johnny was great and asked us questions to narrow it down. Then he took us to view a few and find the right one for our needs. He took care of us and answered any questions we had. Thanks Johnny!<//Review>

Gate constantly does not open. Code is accepted and displays "access granted" but gate does not budge. Have to wait until office opens in order for them to manually open gate. This issue probably won't impact someone that doesn't need access past 9 am but for someone like myself that keeps equipment and materials here that are used to make a living it has been incredibly impactful and has caused a loss of income.< /Text>

The facility seems very clean and well managed. Kristina was the person who helped us and was very nice when showing us the various storage unit options. Professional and friendly. We still need to see how the service holds up with the test of time. Will update.</Review>

I was moving to the area recently and I hate the process of moving, particularly deciding where I feel like I can keep my items secure for a fair price. Kristina is the manager here made it an obvious choice for me, I can tell she genuinely cares about the safety and cleanliness of her facility and I know I can sleep at night knowing my items are secure. The place is well lit at night and Kristina lives on the property! It's clear to me that when it comes to storing, it doesn't get much better than this. Thank you Kristina!!< /text>

<text>So fast and so easy, I totally regret putting this off as long as I did. Signing up online sped up the process a ton, and everything was ready when I arrived!

I didn't know what to expect, but Johnny answered all of my questions before I could even ask them! He showed me where everything was and explained the process during the tour. Super helpful, went above and beyond!

The rates are better than anywhere else in the area, I can't wait to finally finish my spring cleaning!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I was looking for a place to store some items at a good price. I called around to a few storage companies and they were too pricy or not in a safe area. At last, I called the very last the last number in my search and found this place. Rubin was such a delight and professional. He quickly answered all my questions, reviewed the paperwork and was very informative about the storage units. Adrian was very pleasant and extremely helpful. She provided some guidance and tips on making storage work best to suit my needs. She is also very familiar with the area which is a relief. The place smelled wonderful. Very clean and most of the people that came in and out of that place were so friendly. I truly feel I got my money's worth as I'm getting great service, amazing attitudes and much needed storage place. Thank y'all so much!👐😁😄</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I am on crunch time to move to a beautiful new city in Oregon from Rancho Cordova Ca and needed to get a storage unit for my entire house. Stress to the max I reached out to this company because not only did they have the cheapest rates but they also offer first month free. I spoke to a man named Johnny Forge’t and he is an absolute angel! He helped us like he was driven to put our needs first. Thank you so much for making this chaotic time that much easier. You are the best! I Will definitely be spreading the word of how great you make this company!!!< /Text>

<Text>Reuben was absolutely awesome. We just moved to CA from TN and ended up having to put our things in storage for a short time. Reuben was awesome trying to help us find the exact right size of storage unit, very fast with everything and possibly the friendliest person we have encountered in CA so far. The unit was exactly what we wanted/needed. It was great to have an option of a very large unit. The facilities were clean and the gate has not had any issues. Also had no problem getting our 26' truck around the grounds.

Reuben and Jessica were truly amazing! It was a such great service experience from start to finish!

I set up the reservation online and was immediately contacted by a representative that was super helpful and nice. Not too long after that I received a call from Reuben to set up a time to come look at the unit and pay. When I got there they were super friendly! I was a little unsure of how much space I was going to need, but Rueben really worked with me to decide what size would be best. I ended up choosing one unit size larger and am so glad that I did!

The facility was very clean and has nice wide driveways. I've had storage units in the past and this is the best experience I've had!< /text>

These guys have the best customer service out of any place I've ever done business with. They have been great with all the people I've recommended since day one. Call me crazy but there is such a good thing as a good fair salesmen. And it appears they work at extra space storage< /Text>

So professional and friendly.
Ruben and Adrienne always go out of their way to welcome me by name and to handle any issues that arise which is not often.
The property is always maintained and in excellent condition. I truly Love them..
I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE NEEDING A STORAGE UNIT.< /Review>

I had a great experience at Extra Space Storage. My son attends Sac State and needed a place to park a large SUV over the summer. The rent to store it was very reasonable. Other storage place wanted two or threes times more just to park this vehicle in a outdoor lot. The process to rent the space was quick and easy. Making payments online was easy too. I can not say enough good thing about the staff. They were so helpful and friendly from the time we dropped off the car to the time I picked it up. When I went to pick it up after two months it would not start. The staff working on July 29th really went above and beyond to help me. Before I could call roadside service, they were out there with jumper cables to give me a jump start. Thank guys!< /Text>

This location is great right next to the freeway and easy access. We can come to our storage room anytime because its so easily accessible. The rooms are great we got a 10 x 30. They just repaved the road which is really nice and the staff especially Andres who was such a great help during our moving process they also let you use the their truck for move in. Wouldn't think of using a different location this place is perfect< /text>

Christina helped me sign up for a storage unit today. She was great. She is a kind, calm, trusting and gracious woman. Extra Space Storage had the best price in the Sacramento area PLUS they had a 14 foot truck I got to use for free, gas not included.< /Text>

< Review>
Had an excellent experience here and all my questions were answered.  The associate Andres Knowlton made me feel welcome and was extremely personable.  Having a bad experience in the past I was skeptical but Andres took good care of me and made me feel very comfortable through the whole process.  I found the location to be the most competitive in pricing as well.  I would definitely recommend Extra Space Storage and will continue to do business with them in the future.<//Review>

This is the best place to rent storage space from.  Very friendly and accommodating staff, they went out of their way to help me out multiple times. Also have very long gate hours (7am to 10pm) and a truck you can use once to help you move.< /Review>

Rueben and Jessica offered top notch customer service!  I was in a hurry to rent a unit last month and they were super friendly and accommodating to me; this being my first storage rental, I was surprised at the level of service they offered.  I am very thankful to them for the very pleasant experience :)<//Review>

<Text>This was the best priced units in Rancho. The employees were more than helpful. They took care of everything I needed. I already know two people that are going to Extra instead of the other guys. The grounds and units were kept very neat and clean.
Thanks again,

This Extra Space Storage in Rancho Cordova, CA is conveniently located, well kept, and has great customer service.  The manager, Andres, is friendly, willing to help and accommodating to your needs.  When I moved in, they were patient, willing to answer my questions, and helped me set up my account.  If you are looking for a storage place that is professional with great customer service, this is the facility to choose.</text>

I'm have the storage unit since July 2nd 1986. I have gone through approximately 10 different companies or more at this site. Extra space has by far the most helpful and courteous and efficient that I have deaKilt with in all of that time and that's a long time. I can say unequivocally that extra space is the best storage company I have ever dealt with. And as far as Ruben is concerned the management this particular office he is the bomb. He is Johnny on the spot when you need something always there to prevent something from happening always thinking ahead and by far professional and courteous a great face for the company. I could go on and on but why just use this facility and you will be happy!</Review>

<username>Hyoma Kouga<//username><Date>1389489240072<//Date><rating>5</rating><text>One would think that like most storage places, customer service would be non-existent here, but  surprisingly the two individuals who work here go above and beyond to make sure that not only are you satisfied with their storage facility but also understand what you're signing up for.

The two guys I worked with were named either Andreas or Andre, and Brian, I can't recall the spelling of their names.    The way they greeted me was fairly refreshing, as I was treated more like a friend than just another customer.  They went over all the details with me, and helped make my move with them as smooth as possible.

I would 100% recommend this facility over any,  if only other businesses would go out of their way to look after their customer base, looking at you Wal-Mart!.

We had such an amazing time working with extra space storage

Rueben and Jessica were two of the most amazing people to ever work with!!

They actually brought us cold waters to our storage knowing would be there all day

Gravis a great deal to move into a new size unit

This is by far the best experience I've ever had with any storage place and believe me at there have been some nightmare situations in the past but not here at extra space storage they're the best!!

Thanks

Awesome. Awesome service.  The place is in immaculate condition. In a safe and secure environment.  The customer service makes you feel like family. They are warm and polite, but most importantly professional. I would recommend this storage facility to anyone. Hats off to them. We need more andres and marcels in customer service.< /text>

One would think that like most storage places, customer service would be non-existent here, but  surprisingly the two individuals who work here go above and beyond to make sure that not only are you satisfied with their storage facility but also understand what you're signing up for.

The two guys I worked with were named either Andreas or Andre, and Brian, I can't recall the spelling of their names.    The way they greeted me was fairly refreshing, as I was treated more like a friend than just another customer.  They went over all the details with me, and helped make my move with them as smooth as possible.

I would 100% recommend this facility over any,  if only other businesses would go out of their way to look after their customer base, looking at you Wal-Mart!.

<rating>4< /rating><review>Service was as expected. Moved in back in Feb '12 and out in Aug '13 They had a free truck to use for move in and I ran over the allotted free time limit but since no one was scheduled to use it after me they didn't charge me for it. It's great to know a business can be accommodating and friendly. The move out was as easy as picking up my stuff and leaving. During their AM lock-check they noticed mine was locked anymore and called me. Just let them know I didn't need it anymore and they took me off autobill and closed me out. With moving and all other things to do, the added level of service was refreshing. I'll use them again if the need arises.</review>< Pics>

We emptied our storage unit to move out of state. Had our storage unit for 3 years. Started out at $75/month for a 10' x 10' unit. By the time we moved the price had gone up by $64. Clerk wasn't available for check out. The company has had about 4 different managers in 3 years.< /text>

< review>
Andreas went so far beyond customer service tonight it made my head spin! His place did not have the size unit I needed ( he is very near capacity), but he truely wanted to help us. He searched for a nieghboring facility without us even mentioning it. We also needed a truck. Again he personally did not have his available, but (without the slightest hesitation) searched for a local truck. He even had a code that gave us a discount on the truck. We discused extended stay motel lodging and he had that answer as well. We thanked him for being so generous with his knowledge and connections and parted company. As we were leaving wegot a call and pulled back in the parking space to take it. As we were on the phone he came out and handed me a piece of paper with more notes about extended stay motels inthe area. ANDREAS , YOU SIR  HAVE THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!

Thank you,
Robert Peters</review>
