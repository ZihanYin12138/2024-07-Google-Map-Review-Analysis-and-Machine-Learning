Phoned them twice with queries regarding one of their products. Good explanation and very patient when I phoned a second time to resolve a minor detail. Thank you Robert! It would be most helpful if their catalogue were updated as it is 10 years adrift which resulted in a degree of confusion. However, ABS are there to help.< /Review>

Staff was nice & professional about my Master cylinder rebuild. Fair price, fast turn around time. Brakes working great now! 👍
Keep in mind: You bring the part, not the car to this location.</text>

Absolutely not. I will never bring them anything ever again. They tried 3 times to rebuild my master cylinder and had the nerve to charge me to repair their mistake. No, no, no. If you like stopping, don't shop here. The customer service is just terrible.<//Review>

When we arrived it was already pre packed and ready for us. Eddie was super friendly and helpful with all the questions we had.

<review>They need a better policy on answering questions on problems that you have with there electric power brake systems. I have sent two emails to them with no results. I have talk to them on the phone twice & can't get an answer. I wish I knew this when I purchased this product. I just have simple question about the wiring , It must be some highly guarded secret or there teck dept. is lost .The problem is the pressure switch!</review><Time>1524946137938< /Time>< Resp>

<text>We put an ABS electric brake system with the remote accumulator in a street rod.  the pump and accumulator  failed after only about  1200 miles which IMO was related to design issues.   ABS offered a replacement (updated) pump and accumulator at a significantly reduced price to replace the original units.  So far the updated system has performed flawlessly.  Regarding servicing this system there is an "O" ring that is placed between the accumulator and the pump body.  Care must be taken not to damage that "O" ring and insure it is evenly compressed when tightening the accumulator.   When operating correctly this system is a good solution for a frame mounted M/C.   Both Pedro and Memo were very helpful in correcting the problem and offering a reasonable settlement for the failure.< /text>< Pictures>

I have talked to these clowns two times, Memo said he would email me the info but never has. I am going back with my old system & anybody that gives them any business in the future is waiting there money & time. I really feel let down & hope this not the way they do business. For a usa company it sure is ashamed that people do stuff like this.<//Text>

The absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced from this company.  The product, although used in many vehicles has failed 3 times completely, with the last failure being a pressure switch.  I figured it would be simple enough to get a new one, so, I took a picture, e-mailed it to them, and followed up with a call.  This was on 7/14/17.  During our call, I spoke with Memo, and he transferred me to someone to place the order.  I gave them my CC number and expected it to arrive 5 - 7 days later.  8/6 I hadn't received my part yet, so, I called and I finally received it today 8/14, and, of course, it's the wrong switch as well as they over charged me (they told me $45, I was charged $80) and I requested they ship it FedEx on their dime, it arrived UPS on my dime.  Done with this system, good riddance ABS!<//Text>

<review>Basically they make there own brackets and then just take other rotors and calipers from other cars and sell it as a kit. While this is smart for them, should you need break pads or seals or whatever you can't go to the auto parts store and get them, because you don't know what year make and model car they are from. The break booster hit a support on my car and they told me "just remove the support". I had to end up removing the proportioning valve, mount it elsewhere and make new break lines to connect the two. Either that or "remove a SUPPORT off my classic car. So the direct bolt on kit isn't quite so direct bolt on. The calipers need painting or they will rust like mine did (didn't say to do that anywhere) The instructions are horrible, the picture isn't clear enough to show how the stuff bolts together, the how to steps are not even close to complete. So if you are a figure it out kind of person you are good cause you're going to have to just figure it out,  if not you're SOL.There are no torque specs....remember this is a drum to disk conversion I can't just look in my OEM book for torque specks. My break lines leak at the caliper, afraid to tighten them any more and break the bolt because there are no torque specs...the old guy that answers the phone is rude and it took way longer to get in than I was quoted (didn't tell me they were back ordered) I wouldn't use there services again. I forget why I chose them over Wilwod to start with. The truck I'm building now and every future build will not have a ABS part on them.</review>< Pics>

They Changed the design of the product does not match photos or directions staff unwilling to rectify problems. DOES NOT COME WITH REMOTE ACCUMULATER as pictured.
Makes unit larger than with remote accumulater greatly limiting the mounting options.
Will be missing the charity car show at Texas Childrens Hospital due to their incompetence. Truck on Cover for the event ! Really Happy about that! Not only do they lie they turned me into a liar DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY..</review>

I have two, ABS Electric Brake systems 57 Tbird, and a 56 Fairlane both of them are having the same issue (pressure switch). Working with these people is horrible, it takes them forever to ship. When Memo tells you they had a bad batch of pressure switches, and charges you for the replacement is bad business . If I had it to do over again I would not use them.<//Text>

<Review>Looks like maybe new management over what used to be La Fortuna Market? They spiffed it up with nicer grocery shelves and look like they have so much more ethnic food. The Mediterranean/Middle Eastern sections has so many options! I am pleasantly surprised!

They pretty much have all the basics you need without having to go to a Safeway which is nice 👍<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObhoji3H006QvdjnkEiB10gWU7nORVTjKstOiA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsKITjha6Pz_WgVEcVandf13RB6FC5peZVS-Eq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMs0lI9OPInoKIRZOw3t4lcPfZ66e3ZLyuH3d0O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF-loLbFj70i0qrau1-EW2akJkO0BIY_hIBhWu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1592354371214, 'text': 'Thank you Jamie!

<Review>One of my favorite spots to get some quick mexican food and groceries when visiting the area. It's tucked in near some Hotels and in a residential neighborhood. If you are near here, swing in. Their deli is GOOD!< /Review>< Pictures>

Great market! Taqueria is excellent! Fresh meats, produce, dairy, all available!
The only place in our neighborhood...if you need it, they have it... plus the owners are very kind! Also, they have lots of ice cream, American and Mexican!!
Not to mention lots of delicious Middle Eastern foods! Just curious why one of the ownero suv license plate says “hero”? Must be a good story behind that😉< /Review>

BEWARE, bad practice. I placed an uber eats order with them for 2 meals and 2 sodas cost $20. They canceled my food order but delivered 2 sodas causing me to pay $9 for 2 cans of soda. What they should have done was contact me as other restaurants have or canceled the order completely. Disappointed to say the least, will not give this establishment my money or recommendation EVER!< /review>

<Time>1603035141328< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I walked into their store in Santa Maria not ever hearing of them before. I was pleasantly surprised by the selection that they had in their store. I was looking for a sectional or just a couple couches to complete my living room. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The delivery process was amazing. They were supposed to get there from 3-5pm and they got there early and actually called when they were almost there. I thought that was really nice of them to call. They were extremely friendly upon arrival and set the couches up. This company really impressed me with their prices and excellent customer service. I definitely will recommend them from now on.< /Review>< Pictures>

We peeked in and met Peter, great, kind, and super patient with us, he instantly won over my 82 yr old mom and so thoroughly impressed my husband, that I started seriously shopping for our livingroom. Well now here we are, lounging on our lovely sofa and really appreciating the incredible delivery men, Issac and Johnny. They were on time, strong, happy to help, and all together making our shopping experience AMAZING!!!! We even have money left over for the rest of the house, seriously, the prices were unbelievable!!! Thank you from VERY happy newcomers!!!<//Text>< Pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Nice staff, terrible business.  Bought a couch in November, said it would be delivered in January. Called every month after January and always said it would be delivered next month, after 6 months of waiting finally cancelled order because they did not know when it would be delivered. Went to a retailer near by and we are having our new couch delivered under a week.

Update- 2 days after I cancelled my order, they called and said they made lots of phone calls and yelled at alot of people and said my couch would be delivered in 3 days...why didn't this happen in the first 4 months of us waiting?</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

We were able to hold our delivery until our new house was ready and everything arrived exactly when we expected. Everything looks great!

<review>I purchased a recliner from the salesman Jorge Mares.   He is a great salesman and I would recommend working with him.   I was concerned that after the first night I had it that I received quite a few bites on my body.  The manager convinced me that it wasn't because of the recliner and that there weren't any bed bugs.  I returned the recliner and they gave me a store credit.</review>< Resp>

We bought a couch and 5 piece dining set from R&R, and we couldn’t be happier! The furniture is great quality at a great value, and the service we received from their staff was fantastic. The person who helped us the most, Peter, went above and beyond in helping us, and never made us feel pressured to buy. I would recommend them to anyone looking for furniture at all price ranges.<//text>

<Review>I am giving them only 1⭐because they were friendly. But they are cheats.Bait and switch! Why you ask. I have been in the market for furniture nd have been shopping around. I was in there store closer to 4 weeks ago and had my eye on a chair. I got  the yellow flier in the mail and see it says name brands at salvage prices. So I think great the chair will be on sale.
I get there and the prices are full retail price 1200 for a recliner that was marked only 599 a few weeks ago.
I ask if the price is set or is there a price drop. They offer me 200 off that particular chair because it's the last one.
Such BS. I told the young man  of being there a few weeks back and I get a well that's the best I can do. I will never step foot in that store again. Bait and switch.< /Review><username>Just Mee<//username><pictures>None<//pictures>< date>

Absolutely received the best customer service here.  AJ was extremely helpful and followed through on everything that was promised.  Sale prices were great and the furniture is of great quality.  After buying a sofa set, coffee table and side table, I went back a couple of weeks later to buy a dining room set.  Will definitely recommend R&R to friends and will be purchasing more furniture, etc. in the future.< /Text>

Erik was very knowledgeable and helpful with his suggestions and good taste. No high pressure sales here. You won’t be sorry shopping this store.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Sales staff are friendly & informative.  They showed me & guided me to the area of what I was looking for.  Provided several options for me to choose from.  They did not push me to purchase the highest price product.
Delivery staff were efficient & productive.  Patient w/ placement of my merchandise even after several minor adjustments &  being indecisive.
High quality merchandise w/o the extremely high price tag.<//review>

<text>Just moved back to California. Have a house being built and needed ALL new furniture to fill a 3 bed, 3 bath house with an additional office room. Jorge at R & R Furniture in Santa Maria made this a pleasant experience for me. Actually it was fun! I exhausted myself by shopping around at every store in town and was not satisfied. I decided that R & R has the best customer service and knowledge of merchandise, affordable quaity items and many to choose from. I looked no further. Honeslty, I could not have been able to furnish this entire  new home without Jorge's expertise and excellent design choices according to my taste and expectations. Thank you Jorge and R & R for making me feel at home these past 2 months.  I was able to complete the journey of furnishing all the rooms in my new home.......did it ALL with R & R.<//text><userid>105295057217269203736<//userid>< Pics>

<Review>We are very, very pleased with our purchases from R&R Furniture + Mattress Outlet and their excellent delivery!  The sofa & loveseat are exactly what we had been looking for.  We are so thankful we decided to stop in at the store to see what was available.  Our salesperson, Sima, was very knowledgeable and helpful in assisting us find exactly what we wanted at a reasonable price!  The two delivery men, Victor & Johnny, were helpful, courteous and prompt.  They set up the furniture and conscientiously checked each of the pieces to make sure everything worked properly.  The gentlemen were careful to make sure door jambs were covered so that the furniture would be protected getting it through our narrow doorways.  Thank you R&R for the excellent service & delivery!<//Review><user_id>115793385313485242745< /user_id>< gmapID>

<Review>I shopped for new couches at every furniture store from San Luis Obispo to Santa Maria and I was constantly bombarded by pushy sales people who didn't give me a chance to look around without them following me everywhere. Then I went into R&R where i was greeted by Jorge! He was super friendly and told me to let him know if I had any questions or assistance & I was able to look around with out being bothered at all! when I was ready for help Jorge was extremely helpful, honest and patient! I will definitely be back for future purchases, especially with helpful friendly employees like Jorge!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>They had promised me the furniture would be delivered in two weeks, it's been about two months and I still have not received it.  Also, they promise they will call with updates but that doesn't happen either.  Basically they will say anything just to make a sell.....<//Review></record>

I was blown away how expensive the furniture was. The sign in the front window said something about lowest prices in town. This was by FAR the most expensive!! At least have a more affordable selection.<//Text>

My sunglasses mysteriously disappeared while I was there for 30 minutes. The lady who helped me to look for those,said kids might have took those away but I did not see any kids ( may be two elderly customers) any during my visit. Erick Mayorga who sold me the mattresses did not even bother asking his colleagues if they had seen my sunglasses when he was the one who was showing me mattresses around in the store. Besides they encourage you to buy local brands like black diamond for higher profit margins. Emailed the owner about this unpleasant experience and I never heard back from him. Apparently he wants to them to make their commission this way by making cistomers belongings disappear.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>I agree with all those negative comments. They messed up our first order and said they would deliver free of charge for messing up. Well never got calls for  updates till I personally went in the store and they said it had just arrived after 2.5 months  I picked it up myself since I was in town, not buying from here again<//text><username>Amir Velazquez<//username>< Date>

They made many mistakes on my order from wrong mattress to making a financial mistake.  After 2 months of getting my bed they forget to bring the box base.  Uggg...lots of frustration with the Santa Maria store.  Prices are at least 50-60% over priced and is crewed up by kids who don’t care.  Stay away!<//review>

If you park on the target side you don't have to walk through the mall that's nice if you are handicapped or need assistance to enter the store. Everything was fairly well stocked and the customer service was friendly and helpful even though my only issue was that when I had questions regarding things from other departments the employees did not seem to know exactly where they were in the store. That would have been helpful so I did not need to walk back and forth across the entire store three times to find the thing I needed and to find that they did not carry it even lol. Anyhow they still tried...
E for effort right?  Anyhow, like I said standard Target environment with a food court upstairs in case you get a hankering for something while shopping and you cannot find it in the store. I have to go back this week I will swing through again to see what it's like. Always something pops out that you might need.  I guess the other thing would be maybe why is the target at the mall? Not near the mall. Usually malls are pretty crazy around the holidays aside from this whole covid deal and I would hate to be running to Target just to get one little gallon of milk the day before Christmas at the mall if you know what I'm saying! Peace out all and good luck shopping 👍

So happy we have a beautiful neighborhood Target here. Yes is small but don’t under estimate because they carry a lot. I was honestly amazed. And so organized in a compact space. The parking lot in the back is simply perfect since is a little hard to find a spot in this area. Also check the second floor. So convenient and spotless.< /Review>

Very convenient location and easy to park in the back. Especially when a couple of spots are made for target customers only. Friendly and helpful employees.</Text>

<Date>1553736049374<//Date><Text>I already did one post regarding my visit to target last week. It is a lot smaller than I though it would be considering that it has 2 floors. All the paypoinr areas 6 are ( do it yourself) and only 1 counter where there is a human taking care of you. A want to be trendy side of target with very expensive nuts and fruit and a complete aisle dedicated to granola bars will make you want to leave rather than stay. Good luck with your shopping experience<//Text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Standing in line for far too long while the one cashier was not manning the customer service desk, when he finally came over informed me I had to go stand in the back of the line, though I had been standing there for probably 10 minutes. At which point, he asks accusatorily the customer behind me if I had been there, or if I had cut my way into line. Absolutely unacceptable! Customer service here is completely garbage, I will not be returning to the store!</Review>

<review>Marketing Flub! This is Target location has tons of potential. The store is a good size and located in a great neighborhood. Other than that, this Target store completely misses the mark.

Why is the majority of the store groceries? Why can’t I order online and have it shipped to this location? Why can’t the staff ever find my orders once they arrive in-store? If customers hit obstacles just trying to purchase and receive orders and the staff is somewhat clueless then, what’s the point of a neighborhood Target?

Get rid of the grocery store elemental; this neighborhood doesn’t need another one of those. That space is better used for essential items like toilet paper, paper towels, toothpaste, etc. You’ll sell more and get more customers through the door. If nothing else, expand your in-store inventory. It’s inconvenient to go all the way upstairs just to realize whatever you’re looking for is out-of-stock, available but at a different, larger Target location, or simply doesn’t ring up at the self-service checkout...ugh! Lastly, expand your online shopping to allow for more items to be shipped to this store for FREE instead of forcing shoppers to visit several locations just to complete one online order.< /review>< time>

<review>This Target is very good and convenient. They definitely have more than liquor and processed food downstairs, with fresh produce, dairy, and milk included. Perfect for quick trips. Staff, especially those stocking the shelves, is incredibly friendly and helpful, even more than Mission Valley. Parking lot available, which is a must in the area. Extremely happy Target is in NP.</review></record>

<Text>I love this Target! It's super convenient to have in this neighborhood and very walkable. The staff are always super helpful too! They price match the Target website as well as a bunch of others (including Walmart) so it pays to pay attention and do a quick search on your phone. I personally like that there are so many self checkouts and there is rarely a wait as a result.</Text>< pics>

<Review>I loved my experience at this target extremely accommodating mangers staff goes out of their way to help you even its not in store. Quick to fix pricing errors on the shelf. My only issue was electronics was lacking for my needs. I don’t care to order online. I like to see what I buy. I don’t want to have to hassle with returning items that are over hyped in the comments.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This location has the best customer service of any big chain store I've been to. A lady by the name of Arecelli ( I hope I spelled it correctly) went out of her way to make sure I found what I needed and helped me with other questions I had. Great experience and glad I stopped at target that day<//review>

My daughter and I shopped here a couple of days ago and we found the people who work here to be so friendly and helpful! We needed a cardboard box to check on the plane and they went to a lot of trouble to find us a sturdy one. We then filled it with protient drinks which made it super heavy. When our Lyft came another super nice guy carried the box out to the car for us. I can't say enough good things about this store! The people who work there are wonderful!< /text>

As someone who lives almost directly across the street from this Pseudo Target I was quite excited for it's arrival! Unfortunately, it is definitely not even as good as having a minimart there. The makeup I can only buy at Target, NO.7, is not carried at this location. And the shampoo and conditioner I can only get at Target, Hairfood, is a $1 more at this one. And when I accidentally bought the shampoo instead of the conditioner at a different location I couldn't do the even exchange at this location...because of the price difference of locations! Definitely, make the trip to a REAL TARGET! NOT CONVENIENT!< /Text>

To the people that are hating on Target or corporations in general in North Park. I'm a native North Parker. This building has sucked for a long time. Wangs was weird. Big Lots was wack, and then before that it was REI and that was actually cool. If you want a two story store like Pigment go to Pangeaa in Pacific Beach. This Target is practical and nice.</Text>< rate>

It is very strange the wave of the parking lot and there is no men's bathroom (there is only the family bathroom and the women's bathroom) and that is something strange.

Este es un Target reciente. Esta muy chica (aun con los 2 pisos) pero aqui puedes encontrar un poco de todo.

By far the best consulting company I know of, entire HR and recruiting team is so helpful. Specially I would like to add kudos and appreciation to Susan, Sara and junaid for helping me in my hiring process, they are so helpful and easy to work. Susan is my go to person always right from the interview process to on-boarding me in client place, she is always there is answer my texts anytime.
I would highly recommend any one who is looking for a new opportunity through Triune.</text>

I am working with Triune from Past one year. I am very thankful to Rahul, Susan & Sara for giving me this opportunity to be a part of Triune. Triune truly care of the Employees, clients & vendors and do their best to support them. We always received our salary on Time and even in this pandemic situation where the companies in the world are cutting 50% of the salary and even some companies are not paying salary to their Employees. But Triune has never delayed our Salary or even payments to Vendors.  I really have a wonderful experience in Triune and would love to work many more years. Anand my Manager in Triune is very supportive and always available to help. Maria is also very professional & helpful. I would highly recommend Triune 😊.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Triune is a great company to work with. It is an employee friendly company that supports them with all their needs. Unlike most of the recruiting companies Triune pays better incentives apart from the salary offered and that too on time.  I am working with Triune from past two and half years and I would like to work with them for many more years. Even during the time of this pandemic Triune successfully managed to sail through, without affecting the clients or the employees. The management provided us enough requirements to work on. I would like to thank my colleagues and manager Gagan, director Susan, vice president Sara and the President of the company Rahul for guiding us through the right track.<//review>< Response>

Thanks to the Rahul, Sara, Susan and Gagan for making me part of Triune Team.
I joined Triune Infomatics as a Fresher, the management made sure that i get all the trainings and guided me thoroughly to catch up the processes. The management is very helpful and supportive. Even during the pandemic, there were good amount of requirements to work with and there wasn't any reduction or delay in salary. The incentive structure provided by Triune is by far the best in market.

Highly recommend Triune :)< /Text>

<Review>TriUne Infomatucs isn’t your typical staffing agency that treats you like a number. The staff there is friendly and personable; they have a great culture and it shows in their work.
I recommend Triune to my friends and colleagues because they genuinely care about you and your career goals. Susan, Sara and Gagan  are excellent. Triune stands out from other staffing agencies by their unique approach to understanding my needs and pairing me with the right company.  Thank you!!< /Review>< GmapID>

<Review>My job campaign was several months long until Triune contacted me about an opening.  They had me working almost immediately after that first contact.  They care about their hires and take the time to know about them.  They succeeded at matching me up with work when so many others failed because of this.  I am glad to have found them as they strive to advocate for both their clients and their hires.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>From my first contact with Triune, I was impressed with the professionalism of the recruitment staff. My opinion only grew as I had more contact with the firm regarding an opportunity in which I was interested. Not only did I feel those working at Triune knew their market and clients, but they were also very sensitive to my needs as an employee and potential contractor. Though this opportunity didn't work out in the end (I hope another comes along soon!), I have no doubt I would have been very happy working with Triune.</Text>< Pics>

Customer satisfaction is paramount. As a consultant, I was very impressed with their very thorough and comprehensive methodology for vetting  consultants. They really go the extra mile to ensure the consultant is a good fit for the client. The management team is very professional and highly skilled. They take a genuine interest in their consultants and really get to know you. Once assigned to a project the management team works hard to support you and help ensure you are successful. It became very apparent to me that they really care and treat their team like family. I highly recommend Triune Informatics, Inc. to both clients and consultants.

Triune was great to work with. They were involved, responsive and professional. From the start the interviews were personal, not mechanical. They went the extra step to get to know me to know if I was a fit for the position they were looking for, and periodically checked in to see how things were going. The whole staff, including accounting and administrative, were helpful and responsive.  Couldn't recommend them more!<//Text>

I have been working for Triune Infomatics for the past 6 months and my experience so far has been excellent. The whole team is very professional, helpful and approachable. Susan went above and beyond helping me with numerous documents that were required for my H1B. She ensured that there were no gaps in the documentation and patiently addressed all my concerns.
They truly care for their employees.  I would highly recommend Triune to anyone who is looking for IT opportunities in SF bay area.< /Review>

I contract with them and they always pay me on time and are always on the look out for more contracts that I'd be suited for even when I'm not actively looking.  They also listen to feed back from clients that I worked with, clients that have good things to say about me, and Triune adjusts accordingly - honestly, that recognition of jobs well done is hard to get from a lot of contract companies.  I can't recommend working with them enough.</Review>

I would highly recommend them as a business partner. Rahul and his team were always available if needed and I would rank them as once of the best firms I have worked with. I value them as a company to do business with and I hope to do so again in the future. Thanks Rahul and all the Triune staff!</Review><Date>1564779306549<//Date>< user>

Everyone at Triune was very responsive if I had questions. Sara worked hard to find me a position quickly, & to get me the rate I required.
She also checked in with me regularly to see how things were going.
Triune cares about their clients.</Text>

I started a contract with Triune Infomatics in March. I really enjoy the work I am doing and appreciate the opportunity. All of the Triune staff that I have worked with have been extremely nice and responsive. It is apparent that they value their customers.</Text>

I have had the privilege to be associated with Sara over the past 10 years. Her rapport with clients has been a real differentiator.

I dedicate my breakthroughs at Wells Fargo and GEICO to sara and her team.

Really admire her work ethics. She is definitely an eptiome of professionalism and is a tremendous asset to clients. Her concern and regard over her employees is definitely standout.

I look forward to working with Triune  again and will be happy to recommend Triune to any clients and candidates<//Text>

<Text>This La Bou near Target in Folsom has been here a long time. The quality and service never wavers..always on their game. Coffee and pastries are delicious. Sandwiches are quite varied. From standard roast beef to pesto..all really good. Husband loves the Chinese chicken salad. The soups are just wonderful. Tomato bisque and Thai soup are favs. All portions are generous.</Text>< Pictures>

Disappointing Chicken Caesar. Chicken was unexpectedly completely cold.  Would be a good option for the cashier to ask and provide guests an option to have it heated.  Poor ventilation in the restaurant means you will walk out smelling like a grill.</Review>< Pics>

It's nice having a place like this close to home. Prices are pretty reasonable, and so far, everything my wife and I have tried has been tasty. I wish the Chai was a bit more on the spicy side, but it is still good, and I would order it again.</Review>

<review>I love their Hot Turkey and Cheese Croissants! Only one Star less because there is a man working the counter and I feel like he is being a bit condescending. I have been helped by him twice now and his attitude has been the same both times. I prefer to have the cute little black girl wait on me. She is so sweet! A much better attitude would have had 5 Stars.< /review>< username>

Sandwiches and salads are always good.  But, the Spartan decor rather dampens the experience.  We often buy spinach or noodle salads to go as sides for home dinners.</text>

The one star is because the food is good. Unfortunately the service is terrible. The supervisors   are very rude. They never have a smile and if you get your order wrong they will get really upset and make you feel uncomfortable. If they don't like the job they should let others take care of the customer.  They don't value returning customers. I eat almost every lunch here and yet they stare with anger when they see the customer walk in.<//review>

<Text>Most of the staff is friendly, though they can occasionally be a little short during lunch time. The food is good, although a little over priced for what it is. Coffee is decent. Overall a nice little spot to grab some lunch or pastries. Lunch hour is typically pretty busy though, as there are many offices nearby.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I will not return to this la boy.
The girl behind the counter was curt and did not say good morning or thank you. I noticed she was pleasant enough to the customers that walked in after me.

I called that number to speak to the supervisor and that same person answered. Not one to give up I told her I would find out who her boss is. I am posting a negative review!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This Folsom Blvd la Bou not customer oriented.  Won't bake baguettes early enough for morning customers like the downtown 11th street store does.  Will not serve hot tea in regular cup for here,  only paper cups,  but the downtown store does.  The guy in morning appears to be lazy and has been late opening<//Review>

I was early in the morning. They did not have the item I was wanting to get. I had no cash on me and of course their credit/debit machine was down. No fault to them but I left hungry and empty handed</text>

< Review>
We miss you so much!!!!!
Finally we come back here .
After all this time!!
I love this plates so yummy!🤗
Please keep the hard work..
Customer service is very important..
Just one thing .. the last time I came here my plate was more "dedicated"
The portion was way better.. you can see the pictures and decided for yourself guys..
But still I will come back soon with good expectations..
Thank you again</Review>

Chicken Meat was great - right after the grill. Wrap itself is hard to eat cause its all falling apart. Overall taste is questionable. And sides are weird. Service was decent. Average spot. Not my cup of tea</text>

Maria F is super rude and it’s not a good trait to have given now if people are giving you business. I asked her for two red and two green salsa and I was told I had to pay for the second one. I’m buying your food you should give me the salsa for my food I just paid you.
Retrain your staff for better service and less attitude to the consumer who’s trying to keep you in business.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Always put me on hold every time I call and never take my order have me wait and never get back to me while I hear them taking other orders on the counter then taking mine quick since I have my order ready won’t even take that much time. I like the food but the service is horrible this a reoccurring problem all the time I call I just end up choosing another place to eat and they don’t even understand what am saying sometimes.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Lack in customer service!
I paid for extra pita bread, when I went to pick up my food they didn’t put it in I just told the young lady they forgot my extra pita she told the guy in the kitchen to get the extra pita bread as he looks at me I asked if he could please warm up the pita bread he absolutely ignores me and goes in and gives the girl the pita bread (there was no doubt he heard me)
She gives it to me and I ask her if they could please warm it up, se goes to him and asks if he could warm it up and he just nods and says no
I’m paying extra for it at least serve it warm I just felt like they didn’t care
I am a frequent customer and I already wait a VERY LONG time for my food at least serve it right</Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Decided to randomly try this place without reading the reviews first. I ordered a simple chicken breast salad to go. Took 15 minutes for that to be made. When my order was ready, it was made to eat there vs to-go. The cashier's fix for that was to dump my salad into a to-go container in front of me. Also the amount of chicken you get with the salad is just sad. Do yourself a favor and get Kabobs/Mediterranean food elsewhere.</Review><time>1568663461139<//time><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>Phil Corona< /user_name><gmap_id>0x80c29c1878b9d283:0x963a6d8b2ed60c78< /gmap_id>< Rate>

You may want to order your food 30 to 45 minutes before you actually want to eat. A food court where families go to different restaurants doesnt work when Massis takes 3 or 4 times as long as the other restaurants.<//review>

Massis Kabob offers Middle Eastern cuisine in the food court of the Westfield Topanga Mall. They have a few beef kabob dishes, a couple with fish: trout and tilapia, as well as a lamb dish. Most all come with basmati rice and a side of what is often referred to as Israeli salad (cucumbers and tomatoes). So, the rice is generally good, the meats however can be dry and often have charring from the grill. Some don't like that, but it is at least properly grilled. Prices are moderate, certainly higher than what you'd pay for cheaper fast food options. Service is okay.<//review>

If I could put no stars I would!!  They had TERRIBLE customer service!!! We went there and waited 10 min, then asked if either of the ready plates were mine. The woman said no, and I waited another 10 min. A few people had ordered after me, and received their food. I brought my receipt and asked about my order. She looked at the receipt, then rushed around looking for a copy of it, asking her coworkers about it. They were discussing it in another language, then the cook said “this is same as your order”, referring to another plate that was someone else’s order. They didn’t apologize for being late, forgetting my order, or not communicating with me. They did not own up to it or apologize for it.<//review>

<review>Worst service ever! Every one was completely unfriendly and rude from the second you approach the cashiers in the Topanga Mall location. Not one employee bothered to raise their head and greet any of the customers much less ask if we’d like our receipt or thank you your food should be ready in a few, for example, like a good establishment should. A girl with black glasses was standing there for five minutes staring at my food before she made the grand gesture of handing me my food and when i asked her if she could cut it in half her and coworker too obviously started criticizing me and the rest of the customers that were standing right in front of them. Not to mention how disgustingly awful they had their condiment section where trash was all over it and not one employee cared enough to wipe down even when people who didn’t even order from this terrible location came to tarsh their garbage right in front of them! If I could rate this location and their employees 0 stars I would. You have been warned never come here!!<//review>< pics>

< Review>
The staff needs a major improvement in their customer service.  I waited for 25 minutes, watching people who placed their orders after me get their food.  They had clearly skipped my order.  When I asked about, it, they were frantic about trying to find a copy of the receipt I had shown them.  Someone after me had ordered the same thing, so they offered me theirs.  Completely unapologetic, no offers to satisfy me as a customer.  I was too hungry to care at the time.  After I ate, I asked for the manager, who was not present.  I told the staff member (no name tag, said she was the assistant manager), and she said "I'm sorry" in the a tone and with a look that said "I don't care, go away".</Review>

Around 6:30, my family ordered food here.The rice was too damp and served with cucumbers and tomato salad sides, the sauce tasted nothing.It's time to wrap up and make a rough meal.I will never think of food here again.The food was really serious.< /text>

I am so grateful for the team at Lush Balloons.  I put my order in at the very last minute but they made it happen with no sweat.  I was more than pleased with the arrangement and everyone commented on how great it looked.  The price was right and the customer service was amazing.  I am so happy to be able to support our woman and minority owned businesses.  This company exceeded my expectations.  I will definitely use them again!<//text>

<Review>Called the afternoon before balloon bouquet was needed, Michelle was so helpful and understanding! She gladly accommodated my last minute request.. thankfully!

Ordered again!! Thank you Michelle! People please understand when I say customer satisfaction is one of Lush Balloons main priorities.. that is no lie! Once again I procrastinated in submitting my order, Lush came through with a next day order and delivery with no problem. I had no idea the bouquet was going to be as tall as my boss 😆 she was in awww! Thank you Lush Balloons! I tried to leave an additional review, google would not allow, so I edited my 1st review.<//Review>< pics>

A few friends surprised a girlfriend for her B I G 40, wanted to get her a fun balloon bouquet to set the mood for the weekend. This bouquet did the job, the colors, the size of the bouquet were all perfect. I was texting with Michelle about delivery and she was great very quick to respond, and had the great recommendation of delivering to the restaurant, I even got a courtesy text once delivered. Great product, and the best customer service! Thank you Lush x<//Text>

<text>I’ve seen Lush’s displays all over local social media and they look amazing. I finally had the opportunity to order, via online, a bouquet to surprise my wife for her birthday. Communication and delivery was spot on! Wife was in awe! Everyone loved the bouquet! Big thanks Lush! Looking forward to our next order!</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The staff is friendly and informative. Lush offered to come back with our outside arch order because they knew the direct sunlight would pop the balloons. They came back and did the set up after the shade set in, perfect timing for the party. Thank you Lush staff for giving my niece exactly what she envisioned and making her special day!< /Review></record>

<Review>I would recommend Lush! They did a fantastic job on my husbands birthday balloons. He loved them! The display looked just like the photo on the website if not better. Online ordering was easy and they offer convenient pickup or delivery options. Plus, who doesn't like to support local family-owned businesses?<//Review>< Pics>

I have ordered from Lush Balloons for different occasions and they have delivered amazing work every time. From birthdays to even proposals, Lush Balloons has made some of my life events even more memorable with their beautiful long lasting, high quality balloons. They are very experienced in making your visions a reality. Their online ordering process is easy, and the contact-less delivery is perfect, especially given the time. For any upcoming special occasion, please do not hesitate to contact Lush Balloons.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrwMQfsb8rFeNAv7eNx6ymWnTQbmxSOIvX0Bsq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuYtm4jlBCHGE2qaSaWpdv1qFE6INL5nVXgILo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1608101540347, 'text': 'Hi Jose!

Fantastic customer service and an ever better product.  We had Lush Balloons decorate a venue for a 21st birthday party and everything was top notch.  They showed up on time and made the room more festive then I could have imagined. This company is the BEST!!!  I will use them again and again.<//text>

Lush Balloons has a customer for life and I will make sure everyone uses their services as well. I was originally going to go to Party City, because who do you usually think of when you need balloons??? I'm so glad I looked for someone local to me. I was really nervous because of my poor planning, but Lush Balloons came through for me!!! I was so thankful and my grandmother loved her balloons. They were exactly as pictured and absolutely gorgeous!!! Oh and did I mention the delivery??? Superb service!! I love this company!!</Text>

I didn't get to see the balloons, but considering that I called at 1:30p to have something delivered to a hospital for the child of an employee the same day was exceptional. Sean was super helpful over the phone, even sent me texts with pictures of the options they had available as I was not in person. I would recommend whether or not you're in a pinch!</review>

I live across the country and have recently sent two balloon bouquets and other goodies to our grandkids. Not only have the orders exceeded expectations, but the customer service at Lush was fantastic. They are a delight to work with and it gives us pleasure to support a small local business. They let the customer  know when the order has been successfully delivered, too.  I couldn’t be more pleased and would not use another balloon vendor in the Sac area other than Lush!</Text>

Lush had amazing service and contacted me right away when they were delivering so I could give a heads up to my family to surprise my uncle! I am very happy I was able to send my uncle a sweet surprise admist a pandemic as I was unable to travel to USA for his 50th birthday. He was thrilled and pleasantly surprised.

I was thinking twice about purchasing balloons for my son's first birthday and I am so glad that I pulled the trigger as it added so much to the ambiance of the party. The team at Lush Balloons were responsive and very reliable and most importantly they were creative. Don't be like me and think twice, just order your balloons!<//text>

sloppy workmanship on repairs. I had a new ph that fell out my pocket and cracked the glass.  Celine damaged my phone prying the glass off without the proper tools, then tried to tell me she didn't damage it. Even though I'm looking at it. In my face she tried to say it wasn't damaged. She argued to defend herself instead of apologizing. It was like pissing on me and telling me it was rain water. I don't recommend this place.< /text>

Not the greatest repair but at least it was done. I brought in my Samsung Galaxy s8 to have a stuck sim tray fixed but I guess I wasn't sure how it was supposed to look like after. They made me sign a paper that if anything breaks I cant blame them for the damage they caused. They took the back glass out so they can take the tray out, after that the sim card was mangled but still working. After the job was done they didnt have the sim card tray so I had to buy a new one at Amazon for $4.50. Also the back glass is slightly bulging out. I would only use this place as a 2nd choice after best buy from now on.< /review>

Amazing store, Amazing Service, Amazing experience!!!

Today it is almost impossible to get by without a smart phone. My phone broke not to long ago and a friend referred me to "The Fix". I have never really trusted smart phone fix it stores until I came here. I walked in and couldn't help but notice how organized, clean, and professional the store was. As I talked to who I believe was the owner, I could tell he knew what he was doing. He was so polite and extremely helpful. He had the parts on hand and instantly got to work on my phone. I was absolutely amazed on how fast my phone was fixed. I couldn't even tell it had been taken apart, and it has ran perfectly since then. I would highly recommend "The Fix" to anyone with smart phone issues. Nice Job Fix, you can count me as one of your loyal customers.<//text>

<review>PLEASE READ!!

I had a terrible experience.  I got my screen fixed here, and my phone stopped charging 2 weeks after.  I brought it in and they said they would fix it.  They put in a new battery, but after they were done there was a dark spot on the screen.  They took off the screen to clean it because when they put in the new batter, they were careless and let everything move around on the inside.  Then, after the finally fixed the screen, the home button stopped working.  After waiting ANOTHER 30 minutes, and after they broke my phone even more and told me to come back another day because they wanted to go home, they finally fixed it.  I thought everything was fine until 5 minutes later when I got to my car.  When I plugged it in, it didn't charge.  So I was right back where I started, except now I lost $50 for the new battery.  Fast forward to the next day, I brought in my phone at around 12 and they said everything would be working when I returned.  I got back at around 2:30, and it wasn't fixed.  I asked for a refund and put my receipt on the counter.  The person working there said yes.  He got out his Android and told me he was calling his boss. He ended up calling mall security, and said I was being violent.  The mall security officer had common sense, so he arrived he immediately took my side.  He pulled me to the side and told me to get my receipt and go to the mall offices to speak with the GM.  He asked the person working there to see my receipt, so I could get a refund.  However, the receipt was no where to be found.  The person working there had thrown it away when the officer was talking to me and expected to get away with it.  I spoke with the GM of the mall, and she told me this isn't the first complaint they've gotten.  Big surprise.  I'm still working on being refunded, I've had an awful experience there, the customer service is the worst, and they don't do a good job replacing your screen, and worst of all, my phone is completely broken now, solely due to the fact that they cannot fix a screen, much less operate a business.</review>< gmapID>

< review>
I was debating to buying a screen protector replacement because my current one was obviously damaged, but instead i called a few repair shop to inquire about screen protector because i had a spare. Chris offered to service my note 8 for free.. i just saved myself 60 bucks because i only trust 1 screen protector brand(whitestone dome note 8). Chris manages the shop and he REALLY does put the customer first for his reputation. This is what i look for as a customer. I gotta say i rarely go to repair shops because i take good care of my phone, this is the first repair shop and will be the only place i will go to from now on. Thanks for the excellent service and for hooking it up for free man.< /review>

Horrible customer service! I called asking for pricing and information for screen repairs needed for My iPhone10S. They're open until9pm, I made the call @ 7:15pm Thursday evening. The gentleman who answered the phone was obviously trying to get me in the door rather than answering questions over the phone. The quoted prices were ridiculously high compared to other repair shops in the area.  I was asking why the prices varied and which screen does what and the cost of that particular screen and the man was short, and had an attitude. He was trying to get off the phone and was pushy that I should "just come into the store and we'll help"< /review>

READ!!
The man running this place scams people and does not care about customers. I went to return a case and the man took the receipt, threw it away and refused to give refund. There are so many better places to go to other than this one. What happened is against the law and is not the first time this store has done this.</Text>

<text>I've had to take my phone back 4 times, because it's glitching. I got really upset because I can’t afford a new phone, but the man who was working (he has light brown hair) was very patient with me, & fixed the issue.<//text>< Date>

<Time>1620314461320<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Great price, and quick quality service. I brought my van and checked out the tire I thought had a nail on it but they tested it by dunking it on water and was fine. I requested that they do that to the rest of the tires and they found 2 nails in one of them. They patched up both holes and also dunked them in water. I spent only $35. Thanks J&J Tires!<//review>< pics>

<Text>I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a place that is friendly and helpful. I was having trouble with other dealerships being a first time buyer, but thanks to the guys here they tried their best to help me out and I was able to leave with the car I wanted! The crew at this shop definitely goes out of their way to make everyone happy. Check it out if you’re looking for good deals and a very nice staff.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x8091425eb225235d:0x2fce566c6af7a355< /Gmap_id></record>

Had a great experience with Efren. Was in doubt, he made it so easy and honest with the whole process.  Junior helped with the finance. Of course the wash and detail done by Juan. These guys are amazing.  Thank you for helping me with my purchase of a 2021 Chevy Silverado LT. I love it! Highly recommend anyone looking for a great deal...come here!<//text>

They were honest and sincere and went above and beyond by running numbers that got us a lower payment with an amazing warranty. I would highly recommend Merced Chevrolet to anyone.

I was helped by Ruben and Christian today! I have been searching for a car for so long and initially I went in looking for a used Toyota that they had on the lot. They ended up getting me a great deal exactly at my budget (probably even better!) for a brand new 2020 Chevrolet Malibu instead! Customer service there is amazing and it felt like I was part of the family. I’m so glad I made this decision and I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase and the process that went with it! A HUGE Thank you to Ruben and Christian for keeping it at my budget. P.S (sorry for accidentally breaking the congratulatory bell! Lol)</Text>

I needed an oil change, tire rotation, a repair on my cooling system and a new switch to be able to roll down the right rear window of my car.  Getting the parts required I leave it overnight.  Merced Chevrolet gave me a loaner car so I could get around until the next day.  My car was ready the next day before 11:00 am and the cost was reasonable given the parts and time needed to make all of repairs.  Nice job and  thank you Merced Chevrolet!<//review>

<review>The parts and service departments at Merced Chevrolet are truly 5 star. The parts department always has what you need in stock, and when they don't they usually get it next day. Gio in service always makes sure his customers are taken care of, and does not hesitate to go above and beyond.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><UserId.>113459712074180619697<//UserId.><Date>1619846476555< /Date>< rate>

My wife and I enjoyed our car buying experience at Merced Chevrolet! We had the pleasure of working with Gilbert, our salesman, who was knowledgeable and very helpful to point out all of the features of the beautiful Trail Boss pick up that we purchased. He made our car buying experience a breeze. All of the people that make up the sales team were very respectful from our first phone call to Latricia, to our final paper signing with Junior and especially Gilbert and all of his help, thank you MERCED CHEVROLET!</text>

I accompanied my son in hopes that we could get him a car. We were met by Yulisa as we got out of our car. She was very sweet and welcoming. She listened to my concerns about credit scores and she made suggestions. Car buying is a long process, but Yulisa was attentive and made sure we were taken care of. Not only was she able to get us the car my son wanted, but we were able to get a decent interest rate and price as well. When it was time to sign papers, she made sure we were helped in a timely manner. Junior was the next person to help us complete our paperwork. He made sure we had all the necessary insurance that a new car owner needs which was a surprise, but very appreciated. Over all it was an awesome experience. I would highly recommend Merced Chevrolet.< /review>

Robert or uncle Bob was so awesome as he walked us through the the whole process. He was so honest and straight forward and treated us with respect. Everybody including the gentleman in the finance dept was kind and accommodating, My son is so happy and excited to drive his Chevy Cruze 2019 for his work...thank you Chevrolet Merced!!!</Review>< pics>

I had a great experience when I purchased my car the sales men were great. The service depart was good too but I was disappointed when I got my car back. I assumed that they would vacuum and wash my car before returning it to me nor did they rotate the tires like it should have been done when the oil was changed.</Text>

< review>
I made an appointment with the Merced Chevrolet service department online which went smoothly.

When I dropped off my 2019 Chevy Tahoe LT, I told the service writer the problem I was having. The problem was my auto insurance company text me stating that I had (3) error codes on my Tahoe. The service writer asks me if the service warning light was on, and I told him it wasn't on. He said if the light wasn't on that there are no code errors probably are none existing.

After testing for error codes, the service writer was correct. There were no existing error codes. The past error code data was not cleared which the insurance company was receiving on there end.

So, my experience with Merced Chevrolet was great. The service writer was very friendly, knowledgeable, and experienced.

Thank Merced Chevrolet, job well done.< /review>

The staff is very friendly and and is open to negotiations. I got a killer dealer on a 2021 Silverado. They don’t accept checks, so the transaction process was undesirable. Other than I had a great experience.<//Review>

Mark got me in for a timing belt change on my Cruze and the team got the thermostat and water pump done as well and was still quoted cheaper than other Chevy dealerships I called.
I recommend you give them a call and compare quotes when you need a complicated repair done.</Text>

<Review>I’ve bought a few vehicles in my time. The whole perception of “time to dance the dance” of auto haggling, but let me tell you, i was shocked to find i didn’t need to even try with these guys. The made it a no brainer from the get-go. Honest, friendly and fast. Made purchasing my dream truck easier than ever imagined. These folks just locked in a lifetime return customer. Thanks Uncle Bob! 6 out of 5 stars would purchase from here again.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1592244996873, 'text': 'Brandon, we are pleased to know that Uncle Bob and the team made your decision a "no-brainer" from the get-go!

Very easy to work with staff is very well trained. They are not persistent, they will ask you what your budget is and they will show vehicles that in your budget range.  Very easy process in choosing the right vehicle for you. Merced Chevrolet will work with if you challenging credit. I think i might return in the future for a truck.  Service department is very fast and efficient with getting your vehicle serviced and back to you within the time frame they had promised you.<//text>

<name>Alireza Mahmoudieh<//name><Review>In October, I put down a 1000 dollar deposit for a new corvette. I didn’t receive the car and requested my deposit back. I contacted them continuously from January - June to get my money back. I called and went there in person many many many times. Not only were they difficult and unforthcoming, I was astounded by their lack of organization and professionalism. Although they promised to return my money on multiple occasions, I never received it. Would give zero stars if I could. I have to file a lawsuit now to get my money back.< /Review>< UserId.>

The sales staff was good almost great, which is why I wanted to leave them a 4 star rating but the truck I have been driving doesnt feel like a new truck feels slow weak sluggish especially compared to my other 2020 silverado LT that has 19,801 miles on and it feels stronger and just has more get up and go and ever since I have expressed my concerns seems like the sales staff has forgot about me and has not taken any extra steps to make sure I'm happy with my purchase. Just seems like they dont have the same energy they did when they wanted to make the sale. I'm going to visit the dealer soon, if they have a better way of handling these types of situations that 2 star rating will be a 5 star real quick lol. And having said that Chevrolet will always be my number one choice for a truck!< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>This place tried to scam me .I was looking at the 2017 buick encore premium for 3 days on their website listed at 15893 . This listing was on multiple sites including carfax and their own official site. So I arrived to the dealership and got to the car , the car had STICKERS saying the price was 15893. All was good so we test drove the car and decided to buy the vehicle . I drove 2 hours one way just to get to this place because of the price on this vehicle which I had been researching for countless hours. We brought out own pre-approved financing through navy Federal credit union.  This is a military branch bank that is accepted EVERYWHERE. They stated that they don't work with this bank and would try to find us a better interest rate. After doing paperwork and waiting for an hour the finance guy comes back and gives us our loan . Price is now 17490. That is a 1600 dollar markup. Also the loan raised our interest rate 3 percent worse and added 12 extra months.  I pointed out the price and they all pretended like I was imagining it.  I walked outside and they removed the price stickers from the vehicle while I was waiting inside ! Fortunately they printed a carfax out before the finance guy started scamming to prove the price was indeed 15893. Everyone there was obviously in on this bait and switch scam saying all these pathetic excuses and lies and trying to gaslight us into thinking we magically came up with the original number. Illegal business practice bait and switch . I hope they go out of business.  Do not trust these guys it is a shady scummy business ! I wouldn't expect an official chevrolet dealership to operate like some 3rd rate scummy auto dealership .

In response to your reply :

False advertisement is illegal i have no idea how you do not know simple business laws.
Thank you for clearing up some of the confusion. We were unaware of who was changing the price of the vehicle the day we were there. Now we know it was indeed the General Manager, which is you.
Regarding the financing, we had a check issued from our bank which was declined by your employees. Even though it should have been treated like cash. Our bank verified this with us and let us know that dealerships ,when they have any questions or issues, they call the bank which is open 24/7. They both saw that we had a letter and check and refused it.
As far as the price of the vehicle, it is not the customers duty to care about profit, nor a requirement on doing research of car values. Dealerships price their cars at what they are willing to sell at. We did not negotiate the price down at all, we simply wanted the advertised price that was posted all over your Website, Facebook, Carfax, Autos.com, Carguru.com and physically posted on the vehicle since 6/18/2020. According to the Carfax report the price of the vehicle has been decreasing since April 5th. So, you have been aware of your profit since April.
I want to know where we are required to call before going to the dealership. No other dealership we have gone to seem to have a problem with walk in customers. So us not calling ahead is irrelevant.
And since you are unaware of the laws in your line of work, here is some insight on the illegal practices of false advertisement.
Section 11713.1. Unlawful acts by holder of dealer’s license
(e) Fail to sell a vehicle to a person at the advertised total price, exclusive of taxes, vehicle registration fees, the California tire fee, the fee charged by the state for the issuance of a certificate of compliance or noncompliance pursuant to a statute, finance charges, mobilehome escrow fees, the amount of a city, county, or city and county imposed fee or tax for a mobilehome, a dealer document processing charge, an electronic registration or transfer charge, and a charge for emission testing not to exceed fifty dollars ($50) plus the actual fees charged for certificates pursuant to Section 44060 of the Health and Safety Code, while the vehicle remains unsold, unless the advertisement states the advertised total price is good only for a specified time<//review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1593993325035, 'text': 'Hello Mr & Mrs Brewster.\n\nI appreciate your feed back on my employees but the two individuals you are speaking so badly of are some of the most honest people I have ever met in my life, and I don\'t agree with what you are accusing them of.\n\nThere is no law against adjusting prices to reflect market values.\n\nWith that said, I\'d imagine you drove two hours to our dealership because the price was in fact low compared to competitors. After reviewing this, I, myself adjusted the price back to market value, which was still a good deal compared to competitors on like vehicles.\n\nNo, we do not work directly with your Military Bank, and I\'m sure if you asked your lender if they work directly with us for funding car loans they would advise you that they do not. They are not connected within our system which would allow us to communicate directly with them regarding your auto purchase and or reviewing your pre-approval. Banks such as yours and a few others will give their clients a loan and in a lot of cases a check for their loan amount to make a lump sum purchase at a dealership of their choosing and that customer would handle the loan with their said bank.\n\nMy employees and our dealership are NOT liars, very far from it. We would not be as successful as we are if we treated customers the way you are accusing us to be.\n\nWhen I received the call from Christian regarding your concerns on the pricing difference I advised him that I did adjust the price back to market value. He advised me that you wanted to purchase the vehicle for the price you, as I\'m sure saw as a "Steal". I advised him that I was ok with that, even though selling it at said price was not profitable to as at all. In fact, selling the vehicle to you for said price would have lost the dealership money, but to earn your business from 2 hours away and to correct any confusion I would allow it.\n\nHe stated you had outside funding for your loan with a bank we don\'t work directly with. Looks like that was in fact the case based off your response.\n\nI do not appreciate the way you are attacking my employees online regarding a pricing matter that was out of their control, and as I said reflected actual market value. They continued to try and assist you by requesting a discount that I did not have to agree too, yet we did. Most people who travel from hours away for a used car purchase price shop the market real well before selecting the dealership. They usually call the dealership to ensure the vehicle is still available so they don\'t waste time traveling. They usually confirm pricing while they check availability as well.\n\nWe are very sorry you feel so badly about us.\n\nI\'m sorry they didn\'t review the price change with you so you understood why it was adjusted. I\'m sorry that you weren\'t satisfied with the action taken to discount our online price once again for you so that you would feel you were getting a deal worth driving hours away for.\n\nBut I know how good and honest my staff is. I doubt they treated you with anything but respect when you were there at the store, and there are PLENTY of customers that appreciate them and our store for doing whatever possible within our means to satisfy their automobile needs.\n\nI am a phone call away if you would like to discuss this matter further.'}<//Response>

I took my 2018 Camaro to Merced Chevrolet to inquire about a new set of tires, not only did they beat the price of a local competitor the quote included a 4 wheel alignment. Gio was extremely helpful in getting the tires ordered and setting up an appointment. Thank you Gio for your excellent customer service.</review>

<Text>Found my pre-owned Late model year 2017 Honda CRV EXL At Merced Chevrolet, during an online search. Spoke with Efron who went out of his way to send me a detailed description of the car and the features, photos, and a link to the Car fax report. Once I knew it was a solid contender, I called Efron to schedule an appointment, al la COVID-19 social distance and masks. As I arrived the car was out front with a “reserved” sign and my name. Efron greeted us and we worked with Craig to test drive and do the deal. Cannot express just how happy we were with Efron and Craig’s professionalism and honesty. This is a down-to-earth team here. I must sincere gratitude to all of them.we would make the drive from El Dorado Hills to Merced to buy another car from Merced Chevrolet in a New York minute. Highly recommend them. Thanks Efron and Craig for having my dream car and being such awesome pros!!  N. Goldberg< /Text></record>

Merced Chevrolet made me feel so welcomed and took plenty of time with me on testing several new trucks. There was also no pressure at all during the whole buying process. Gilbert Garcia was extremely helpful and considerate of my various options and needs I required. I would highly recommend anyone to come and purchase a new vehicle at Merced Chevrolet.<//text>

I had just been in a car accident the week before and as soon as I got the money we went over, Craig was waiting for us and got me into another Trax which is what I wanted.

I knew the car I wanted.  The people Who helped me were professional,
but had a sense of humor.  A minor part was needed and it was ordered
before I left and will be shipped to me.  My only negative is the low fuel
light came on before I got 1/2 way home.<//Review>

<review>I when in to Merced Chevrolet to test drive a 2019 Chevy Silverado RST ..Gilbert a great salesman they have, took his time showing me the truck and the feature it has ..They really do provide a great sales experience at this Chevy dealership, I even did all the paper work online or over the phone. I would completely recommend this dealership to anyone trying to buy a new or used car or truck..The finance department do a great job finding the best rate and payment for any type credit ..so I truly want to thank everyone who helped me at Merced Chevrolet..Thank you guys<//review>< Response>

I had a great experience at Merced Chevrolet I looked at all the other dealers in the area for a specific Chevy 2016 spark EV and Merced Chevrolet had the best price, the best mileage, and the best staff that was easy to deal with.  it was definitely the easiest car buying experience I’ve ever had and I would highly recommend them to anybody in the central valley looking for a great deal.</text>

Outstanding - this is how service should be!  Had my Truck towed to the shop.  Geo called me within two hours of it's arrival and told me what was wrong.  He had the parts and the truck would be repaired the following day.  Geo called me the next morning and told me it was ready.
What great service and fixed the FIRST time!!</text>

I special ordered what I thought was my dream car, which turned out to b a nightmare. Its 3rd time being in the shop it was there a month, during this time i was given a cheap loaner car.
The loaner car tire popped, while i was working out of town, the loaner comes w/no roadside. Which is important for a woman, I had a complete stranger help me put spare on.
Then the dealership had me buy a replacement tire. The service manager is the rudest, uncompassionate person I have ever seen in management. There is way more to this story just worse management ever Rude<//Text>

Christian greeted me as we were walking to the front door. I had a idea of what i already wanted and he walked me through all the options for what i was looking for. He was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything in detail. I was very pleased with my experience the only thing why i didnt give it 5 stars is because my entire day was spent purchasing my new vehicle and i understand its not the dealerships fault just wish the process was a little faster.</review>

This was the worst auto purchase  experience by far! The whole staff is rude and full of it. They were extremely disrespectful towards my dad who is elderly. We went in late afternoon and knew exactly what we wanted and the sales lady Haley just went on and on with her sad life story. They treated us like we were first time buyers and despite our efforts to work with them we were forced to go in the next day to finish. Only reason we ended up buying the vehicle is because it was a used car we were looking for. Avoid this place!

<Review>From the get go i was told by an advisor on the phone, prior to taking my truck in, that more than likely the issue with my truck had to do with pedal control (driver's fault). My truck was making a louder than normal (not the injectors) noise and was having a shifting problem.  Long story short, they found nothing but a bulletin that read the issue my truck was having. I drove it to Turlock Chevrolet and was immediately put in a loaner vehicle. A week later, problem (vent rods) was fixed.< /Review>< Pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I was greatly disappointed about the service of Merced Chevrolet and felt as if my car's problem was not properly diagnosed and fixed. The passenger taillight of my Corvette rattled so badly and made so loud squeaky noise. I examined it and knew that there was a misalignment between the taillight and the bezel trim. The bezel rubs against the taillight and it makes so much noise as it moves. The rubbing was so bad that it already ruined a part of the surface of the taillight. The driver's taillight was fine though. This Coevette still has bumper to bumper warranty on it, so I didn't want to fix it. I called the Merced Chevrolet and Geo answered it. I asked for an appointment, but he said I had to leave the car for the entire day because they might not get to it. That means I was not their priority and could not set an appointment with them. With this adjustment issue, I had to spend the whole day to have it looked at. I dropped off my car the night before and left it over night, so they could get to it the next day. Sadly, the next day Geo called me and told me that they could not get behind it and could not do do anything about it. He also said they called GM and GM didn't want them to make any changes to it. Please stop lying! I know quite alot about Corvette as well and I know they can pop the bezel out and adjust the taillight behind it easily. They assumed I didn't know anything about Corvette and could be lied to. When I picked up my car, Geo took me to the new Corvettes in the Merced Chevrolet and showed me that the taillights of the brand new Corvettes also rattled. Mine was so bad that I can't even compare to theirs in the dealership a bit. I was thinking they didn't seriously inspected it. They thought creating excuses to lie to me was much easier. I might have to drive out of town to get this issue fixed and get other regular services done out of town. It is so bad that you live in that town but can't get your regular services done at that dealership in your own town.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1552589073027, 'text': 'Travis, we are sorry to hear that you were not happy with your experience at Merced Chevrolet!

Excellent service with a clean complimentary waiting lounge. I also noticed that the service writers kept customers informed on their vehicles status. Both service writers would periodically check on waiting customers only to see if they required any assistance.  Great customer relations. Thank you<//Review>

Have a 2018  Heavy duty 2500 2nd time taking it in  For differential seals leaking and still making a windy noise. Asked them to do an oil change and they returned it with out doing it. And the one thing that irritates me the most is that it is a brand new truck and I  Have gear oil and they didn't even attempt to wash it off</Text>

Merced Chevrolet Service department customer service is exceptional with caring individuals who do what it takes to get the job done. From the moment we walked into Service in till we were brought our keys the knowledge and attention to detail has kept us to want to continue to come back. I travel to have my car serviced there I pass 9 other dealerships doing that I like the extra mile they take to make sure I am taken care of.</review>

Biggest liars. Told me they were picking up the smoke gray 2019 Tahoe in Oakdale. After I spoke to Paul in Oakdale to enquire about the vehichle, I was told Merced never made contact for any such vehichle. I was then told by MC I made a mistake calling Oakdale and they wont give up the Tahoe but there was one at the Cheverolet dealershio in Ripon. Long story short I did a vin report and learned they picked the vehichle up in Salinas. It had been sitting for ten months. I wear glasses and should have had them on before signing the contract. Dings, dirt and debris in the paint, scratches on brake light covers, cracked roof racks.  Also documented the wrong mileage on the contract. Tried covering up with more lies. Worse Cheverolet dealer in the valley.<//Review>

I brought a coupon for the first time and Mr.Cowie took notice and flipped through the coupons to find me the best deal. As a matter of fact he was able to find an additional  coupon on his end that I did not have on me physically. He was able to discount my services for more than originally quoted which was a pleasant surprise. My suggestion would to train all your associates to adapt Mr.Cowies kindness and consideration in regards to coupons. I feel like this is something that should be done for customers who have registered accounts with your facility and have continuously brought their vehicle to be serviced at your establishment. This was the first time anyone recommended a better coupon or even mentioned coupons at all. Normally I never get told about coupons, let alone have someone look for a better coupon for me.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x8091425eb225235d:0x2fce566c6af7a355</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I had problems trying to set an appointment online, I called the Service Dept. asked the Service Rep. if he could schedule an oil change.
He was very polite, courteous and made the appointment for me.</Review>

<Text>My wife and I were looking to buy a new SUV, we were on our way back from Modesto looking at another dealership and we stopped in here to take a look at an SUV they had listed online. Immediately upon getting out of our vehicle we were meet buy a sales lady who greeted us and offered us some cold bottled water it was well over 100 degrees that day. She had a short skirt and a low-cut top which might work well for me but not for my wife. She couldn't tell us a difference between two vehicles that were parked next to each other and other hand have been researching vehicles for a few days and knew more about what she had on her a lot then she did. We are very interested in a certain vehicle but it did have some minor scratching scuff damage on the front of the vehicle. One of the finance managers checked it out saw the scratches and then brought back a piece of paper saying that within 100 miles there were only 88 of these vehicles and they had the cheapest one. And they were not going to fix it or lower their price. He he hada rude tone about it and was not attempting to make any sell whatsoever. One of the other things I had a problem with it's well over a hundred degrees and you don't have the AC on in your showroom. I'm coming to drop some serious money on a vehicle you better start treating your customer as if they're royalty in my opinion. Just from my short visit to this dealership I won't be coming back again.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>Towing my 36 ft RV down 99 and suddenly had no power steering or power brakes.  Not knowing the area my wife checked her iPad and found we were close to Merced Chevrolet.  Pulled up to the dealership opened the hood to find my serpentine belt destroyed.  It was Sunday so service was closed.  Members of the Sales Dept helped me park on their lot to wait overnight for the Service Dept to open Monday.  Service Dept opened at 7:30am got my disabled truck in, diagnosed, fixed the problem and had me back on the road by 11:30am at a fair price. This included helping me back my truck and RV out of their lot in busy traffic.  If I lived in the area they would get my business. Thank you Sales and Service!< /Review>< date>

Having noise coming from rear of truck. Took 2017 truck with less than 6000 miles on it. They looked at the tire but never took it off or put the spare on to make sure it was the tire. They said that it's just a noisy Tire. Going to call Goodyear directly. Guess that is how they deal with people that don't buy from them.<//Text>

Overall not a good experience at all. Just not honest and upfront.. Ended up selling the clunker, ex rent a car they didnt tell me about before they sold it to me and got a new car with a real warranty, not a warrant where you have to pay a deductible for..and when you take it in and ask why am i having so much trouble so soon? serviceman says "well it is a used car you bought" Not cool...Service man who i would talk to everytime i would bring it in for service is just plain and simply rude, wont say no names ..</review>

Bad customer service. I was supposed to get my HUD looked at because it had turned off and wasn't working. It started working again before my appointment and they said they couldn't do anything. I would've don't trouble shooting or something. I was going to start using them for my services but I won't be using them nor will I purchase my next vehicle from here.</Review>

I will give it 2 stars only because the staff was friendly especially the maintenance guy who had to drive me home an extra time since the manager in the mechanic shop did not mention anything to me when I left my car there about charging me $115 for a diagnostic that to my understanding would be free since my car had to be fixed for free due to a recall. I would not mind paying those $115 for the diagnostic if it would've been explained to me when he later called me that my car was ready & that the diagnostic did not pick up anything else wrong with my 2013 chevy cruze. I was not at ease with that outcome since my car continued to accelerate on its own while driving. Maybe if they took it for a test drive they would've picked something up as people who "specialize" on what they do. 2 days later I took it to an outside mechanic who within minutes found out the problem, which just happened to be worn out spark plugs & charged me half of what they did at chevy & actually fixed the problem. I am very unsatisfied with their service & will not be taking it there to get fixed any longer. I am a mother who needs a safe vehicle for my daughter and a reliable mechanic. Not someone who just charges & doesn't try to get down to the actual problem. Other than that I'm glad they at least fixed the recall issue as they should.< /Review>

<text>I had a headlight which I thought had burnt out.  So I took it in during lunchtime hours.  All of the mechanics were out to lunch and only the head service tech was available.  He quickly went to work and saw that the connection/plug had overheated and was scorched.  He took his handy pocket knife and cleaned the connection and put everything back together.  The headlight now works perfectly.  Now he could have told me to wait until the mechanics got back from lunch, but he didn't.  Even though he was busy with a pile of paperwork he went out of his way to help.  Because of this they have now a loyal customer who won't go anyplace else.<//text>< pics>

I went to go check out a with my dad. We seen one I liked and  told them we were approved thru a local credit union. They were being polite at first but then changed thier mood. We drove an hour to check out thier cars because a family member had recommended us. I had my bank call the sales rep to advise him that we were good to go so they wouldn't  sell the car my dad just had to stop by the bank and sign the loan papers. With in 24 hours. We get a call from my bank this morning that they sold the car. To someone else.. I kind of got the vibe they didnt believe we were approved already. Not cool. Why would we drive an hour just to waste a dealership time..

Thanks Merced Chevrolet..</Text>

Salesmen and managent practice poor business skills. I was pre approved to purchase vehicle, was on my way to meet with them to negotiate terms and they raised the price from the listed price. Place was a total waste of time and effort. Could not recommend them to anyone.</text>

We are constantly adjusting our pre-owned prices based upon market conditions. Sometimes prices go up, sometimes prices come down based upon market conditions. When you looked at the vehicle on October 24th, the price was lower. However, on October 27th, we adjusted the price of the vehicle to reflect market conditions. Sometimes prices are adjusted down to reflect market conditions. It depends upon market conditions, but we typically price our vehicles aggressively with respect to the market. So usually our prices are better than what the market demands. We hope this explanation helps and please know that our entire team is committed to delivering honest and quality customer service to everyone who visits our store. This desire for honesty and quality customer service explains why you received a call from the salesman letting you know about the price increase before you drove in from Tulare.

<text>I first went in and was basically turned down, then when we finally did purchase the vehicle they did paper work all wrong. I refinanced the vehicle and have yet to see a refund on my GAP insurance that I purchased from them, it's been months I don't get a return call and I'm sure when they final do call they will sat it's been too long. Do t go here buy you vehicle else where they do all they can make the sale but when it comes time to do paper work they are horrible.</text>< pictures>

<Text>Overall my experience at Merced Cheverlot was PHENOMENAL!! My salesman Lee was extremely knowledgeable with all the vehicles I had questions on there on the lot. He had a great approach with the sale, which gave me a piece of mind and not overwhemled. You can tell he brought a lot of experience to the table. I test drove 3 vehicles that day, and got familiarized with 8 other cars we went over and had questions on. Thank you Lee! Thank you Steve for finalizing the paper and for being awesome!

Found the car we were looking for even though it was two hours from Sacramento in Merced. Drove the two hours, got there and was 'helped" (not a good choice of words by Steve or Big Steve) The car was filthy dirty like I was buying a beater. It was a 2016 top of the line Impala. (Guy knew i was coming coulda washed the car right?) There was only one set of keys, he fumbled around for awhile and said he couldn't find the key. He said no problem he will mail it to me the next day. Well it's been a month we've called him 4 times posted a complaint on your website and even called the Sales Manager, no luck. I'm not going away Merced Chevrolet I don't care who or where i have to go, you owe me a key and I'm not going to stop until I get what I paid for. Already building up some support from local citizens to get this done. It would be real easy to rectify the issue just send me my key</text>

Becareful with Mark Borrego in the service department he is one of the worse people I ever encounter. He always overcharge you for the same service others provide. He has the worse attitude. Please if you can avoid this dealer ship.< /Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Took van in to fix with marc. He charged $2,300 to fix it. The van wouldnt pick up speed. Also makeing loud noise. Well when my wife pick it up and drove it home did the same thing. So called marc and told him what was happening he was rude since the begging. Dont know why the owner wil dean would have him even working with the public. Marc said that the van started so therefore they fix it.  What kind of response is that from a so called servise advisor.  Its sad that an american well know company like chevrolet would do buisness in this manner.  So if you want to get ripped off go see marc at merced chevrolet. Ps also spoke to tom so called manager he also wasent helpful pretty much marc told him what to say because i got the same answer. Car turned on that means we fix it. Could never find the email of owner no wher or a number. Hes not even on ther website page.  He must not want to get associated with his own company that take peoples money with out fixing the vehicle. ********* Update**** A week ago i received this response from so called owner of merced chevrolet. First of all this response is a lie. No one ever contacted me and also price of oil and tire rotation what are they talking about.   Quit being liars and do whats right. I believe this response was computer generated or just a flat out lie created by Will Dean.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1513975888614, 'text': 'Alex, thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us.

< Review>
Just got off the phone with some comedian by the name of "John Knight". He explained that he was the manager and that he'd be able to help me with my situation. It didn't take long for me to find out that this was not the case. After explaining to him that the car that I bought FROM THEM was in the shop for neumerous repairs  and that it had been in the shop EVERY MONTH for the past 6 months, he enthusiastically explained that he could do nothing for me other than to sell me another car.He was nice enough to share a clever methaphor with me while I was on the phone with him: " a car is like your child... sometimes they go haywire.... but you still assume responsibility for them". Ha-ha!  WHY THIS MAN IS IN THE FIELD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS BEYOND ME. Teach that man how to do an oil change and put him in the shop where he won't have to deal with customers and continue tarnishing your, already blemished, reputation. Lost my business.< /Review>

{'time': 1476383848579, 'text': 'Holly, we’re disappointed to hear that you were unhappy with your experience at Merced Chevrolet. When you came into our dealership, you already had a great rate from your credit union that our team could not beat and we made sure to let you know that upfront. We strive to maintain a relationship of transparency with all of our customers as we value honesty. There was also at least a 30 minute wait to get your car cleaned that day, which we made you aware of as well. We would be happy to have someone waiting to clean your vehicle which will minimize your wait if you tell us when you would like to come in. Lastly, we do not fill up pre-owned vehicle. Unfortunately, this is reserved for new vehicles only. However, when you come in to have your vehicle cleaned, we will fill up your pre-owned vehicle. We regret that we couldn’t come to a resolution, but we wish you all the best in your car endeavors.'}<//resp>
< Review>
We purchased a car from this dealership yesterday, and it was without a doubt the WORST CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE EVER.  I want to say that I have bought a few cars but never left so disappointed as I did yesterday.  Rick was the sales associate, and my husband and I had already done some searching before we reached the lot and had two cars specifically in mind, we let Rick know this and he took us to the two cars we had inquired about.  After test driving and briefly discussing the two cars we decided that we wanted to purchase a car from this dealer.  Rick took us into the lobby to have a seat and talk financing.  We started off by letting Rick know that we were already pre-approved by our own bank with a bankruptcy on our history at a rate of 3.99% so we asked him to start by running our information and seeing if they could beat the rate with a different bank since we knew they were part of the CUDL system.  Rick proceeded to inform us that "We like to see some kind of down payment with this kind of purchase, so what were you thinking? They like to see something like $4,000." We let him know that was not a problem if that was the route we took but again said that we would like him to just start by trying to beat the rate we had been pre-approved for.  He then goes into the office of a gentleman in charge of getting us pre-approved and after a few seconds comes back out with a print out with the break down of what we would be paying, how much our payment would be and so on.  I noticed at the top it had the same rate of 3.99% so I asked Rick, "Does that mean you guys couldn't beat the rate?" and he replies nonchalantly "We didn't even try..." so we review the print out and we ask him to make some adjustments, he takes the paperwork back and comes out with a new print out and we review it one more time at this point Rick asks, "Do we have a deal?" and I say "fill up the tank, wash the car and you have a deal."  Anyone who has bought a car before would think this is a reasonable offer BUT NO he comes back with, "We don't do that for used cars, only new ones because we can get reimbursed, and the car wash will be about thirty minutes."  We proceed with purchasing the car because we knew regardless of the service we were receiving this was still a good deal for the car we bought.  Mayra B. was great she was friendly, prompt and efficient.  She was the only good part of the whole experience. After we finished we were walked out to the car by Rick who at this point was extremely friendly (unlike before) and once we got to the car he did offer to go over some things about the car but we declined, and he once again asked us to take the time to at least activate our 3 month free trial of OnStar because if we don't he would hear it from GM, but we had already told him we were not interested.  Today I called Ray Tarelli who is the Sales Manager hoping that Ray would try to make it right but he did not express an ounce of empathy towards our experience yesterday.  He actually went so far as to say that it was our fault because we didn't let Rick do his job, when I asked what he meant he said, "Rick was trying to set up your OnStar and you wouldn't let him because you were in such a hurry."HE EVEN HUNG UP ON ME!!! We had already expressed that we were not interested in signing up for something we were never intending to use/purchase.  I then called back and asked if there was someone else that I could speak to a few minutes later I got a call from the owner Will.  Will was nice, I felt at some points he was trying to defend his employees and their actions BUT he tried to make it right by offering to set up an appointment to wash the car and fill our tank but I had to decline, after everything was said and done it came down to the principle, the way Will handled my complaint should have been the way Ray and Rick tried to handle it.  This is not how you treat customers and I will never recommend this dealership to anyone.  Seek a car elsewhere!!!< /Review>
