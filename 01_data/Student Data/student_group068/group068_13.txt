<rate>1</rate><review>I have been coming to this store for years since they were at the other location still off Mission. Yesterday I had gone into the store to purchase extensions which I paid almost $100 for. Not to mention the old man who works there is NOT knowledgeable at all and was no help when it came to deciding what extensions to go with. After purchasing the extensions I walked out into my car and when I opened the extensions I realized they were way too short and NOT real hair like he initially claimed. Hair was STILL intact. Only thing I did was remove the clear plastic wrap which is what allowed me to get a better view of the hair. I walked back inside the store literally within 2 MINUTES of purchase and the old man immediately became defensive when I asked to exchange the hair. He kept telling me “no! You opened package I can’t accept it back.” I tried to explain to him I did not want a refund I simply wanted to exchange and get my moneys worth. He proceeded to YELL “you can’t understand I said no you can buy more if they’re not the right size and that is real hair so no refund and no reimbursement I don’t care! Not my problem!” I asked him to show me a sign that tells me I can’t “exchange” and he pointed at a sign that said “NO REFUND IF OVER $45.” I explained how that sign saids nothing about no exchanges and he proceeded to get loud and kicked me out of the store even though the only person who was loud, rude and completely disrespectful was him. Not once did I raise my voice. I was really hoping that since I’ve been a customer with them for soooo long he would TRY to work with me. That wasn’t the case at all. I felt so violated and belittled I could not believe what was happening and how this person could be so rude. There was two other ladies in the store who realized what was going on and also go upset with the old man with how he was acting. We all three ended up leaving the store after he kicked me out. I didn’t know these women but it was nice to see how they stood with me after I was treated so wrongly. I will NEVER go back to this location because businesses like these with these that are represented by people like this old man, should not be open.</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

There are not many beauty supply stores in Oceanside. When I stumbled across Sunny's, I was impressed with how clean the store was, how the owner stepped from behind the counter to show where the products i was looking for were, instead of pointing in a direction. What made me stop going to another beauty supply store and spend my money here were the FAIR PRICES. To my knowledge, nothing was over priced. I appreciated that so much, as natural hair care products are not cheap. Overall if your in the area, I would definitely recommend shopping here! They've got you covered from braiding hair, natural hair care products, to everything you need in between!</Review>

Sunny's is always my store of choice! Wide variety to choose from and you're not coerced onto buying anything you didn't go there for. The owner is very helpful and the store is organized!!!!

<text>DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR HARD EARNED $$$!!!
The owners of this establishment are extremely RUDE and uneducated about business and the law. I tried to make a purchase using my CC, and they said if I was using a CC they would need to take a photo copy of my drivers license. I explained that I believe it to be illegal to take a copy of someone's ID for this purpose. They said they have incurred fraud and this is the ONLY way they would process my purchase if I use a CC. I told them that I would be happy to SHOW my ID to them, but would not allow them to take a copy. They insisted and when I refused, he (the owner man) basically kicked me out of the store!<//text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp></record>

You can't bring large purses or be on your phone in the store. This guy will eventually go OUT of business very fast. The owner is VERY rude especially to women of color. My daughter was on her phone inside his store and he took her  picture and banned her because she would not get off her phone. Before that she was a frequent customer. He may be nice the first couple times you come but he will ban you at some point. If he asks you to give him four or five stars tell him he has to earn it by improving his customer service.< /Review><Time>1536343475882<//Time><username>Calvin Hill</username>< resp>

If I could give zero stars I would! This place is despicable. I would not recommend ANY person visit Sunny Beauty Supply. They are rude, rude, rude here! I visited this location with my mother in hopes of finding a wig. After perusing their selection of wigs, I found a couple that I thought could work for me. Since this would have been my first time ever purchasing a wig, I wanted to go home and do some research on how to best make a wig look natural. Like any wise shopper, I grabbed my phone to snap a few pictures of the wigs that I was considering. Keep in mind that the wigs I was considering were among the most expensive in the store. What followed was incredibly shocking and incredibly rude. The man working in the store came up and told me not to take any photos. Weird, but, if that's the store policy, then whatever. I'm not an unreasonable person. So, I asked if they had any information cards or something that could give me the information about the wig, or if I could write down the wig's information so that I could remember which ones I wanted. This incredibly rude man ignored what I was saying and proceeded to show me that they had the right to refuse service and kick me and my mom out of the store as I am trying to explain that I wanted to purchase from them! I've never been treated so poorly in my life! I am SO glad that I did not give these crooks any of my money! Take your money elsewhere. Ugh.< /review>

Same ol' following you around in the store routine;  no thank you, no have a nice day.  I feel that the proprietors are extremely racist, certainly, they are rude. I was kinda desperate, so I purchased a wig (overpriced) If you can wait, order from Blackhairspray. Same wig selection. For half the price
Order usually arrives within 5-7 business days. I'll never shop @ Sunnys again.</text>

<Review>I've been passing this place for awhile an wanted to just come and check out the selection. I was just looking around and seeing what I might want to get after paying bills and the guy tells me am I taking pictures because they don't accept that and I was so appauled by his accusations when all I was doing was looking and texting a friend. Now I won't be giving this place any business period.  That was just so rude.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I was a loyal shopper at Sunny's for four years. I went in this shop to purchase a wig for my sister and the man working in there told her that she couldn't try on a wig because her hair was not appropriate. in other words because she has an Afro she couldn't try a wig on. he was disrespectful and i will never spend my money in his store! I recommend all people going to Astou's because she is very nice and warm. Never spend your hard earned money with people who treat you as if you are not a person!

Also I wanted to make this clear, I am not associated with any porn star my comments are real and based on a real experience in the store. I never had a problem with Sunnys and I actually liked shopping there until he did this. You are right he does have the right to refuse service but not because of someones hair texture. It would be the same thing if I was to refuse glasses because his eyes are too squinty! Its profiling and its wrong! That's how you loose good customers. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but that bad day lost him customers!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dc73e220051b25:0xc0f669e59b476c98< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>Sunny and, I think, husband Steven are the most gracious store owners I've met in a while. I'm always wanting to go even if I need nothing just to look. Excellent make-up and prices!<//Text>< pics>

The products in stock were great but the employees followed my family around like we were stealing. I am African American and once my mother decided to speak up to the cashier, others came up to her saying that the same employee was also following them around. They were also African American. The customer service has caused my family to come to the conclusion of never coming back to this supplier after being a paying customer for 5 years. I do not tolerate racial stereotyping anywhere, so I refuse to tolerate it here.</text>

So... As for all of those 1 star ratings? A relatively unknown adult film extra named Mayleena Smith / Skyla Novea was asked to leave this store for making a scene (and possibly stealing). She refused, started screaming at the store employees and had the police called on her. She took to Snapchat with some incredibly racist words for the Asian workers in the shop. She asked her followers to rate the business 1 star / troll it. That's why you're seeing a lot of negative reviews for this business.</text>

I find it crazy how much hate this store is getting. More than half of the negative comments don't even know anything about the store and is only here bc an angry porn star told them to write a bad review so like little puppets here they come. Grow up!! This is his store he makes the rules if you don't like it or don't agree peace leave but to stand there and make a scene what is that going to accomplish? That's right nothing. This porn star should be the one getting a bad rating for acting like a fool being racist then justifying that she's allowed to be racist and say certain words bc of her background. People like her is what's wrong with the world.<//text>

I visited to get an eye exam due to blurry vision when reading. I did a pre check in on their website, which was easy and fast. The staff and doctor Chow got me in and out quickly. They accepted my vision insurance and the total cost for frames and lenses was about $25 after insurance. I recommend to anyone.< /text>

I highly recommend Dr. Schneider and his whole team at Camarillo Vision Center! They are kind and knowledgeable and make the entire process easy from start to finish. They sent text message reminders before my appointment so I wouldn’t forget and I was able to fill out patient paperwork online so once I got to the office I was able to go right back and start getting my eyes checked out. The office was nice, clean, and high tech with the option to do eye mapping where they could take pictures of my eyes to catch any issues that may be going on. I felt they were so thorough and double checked everything to make sure they got my prescription just right. They were patient and I never felt rushed. They helped me pick out awesome frames and lenses and checked my insurance for me and were very transparent about the pricing of everything. Also they had all kinds of sanitizing procedures to make sure everything was Covid safe, but I was still able to try on as many frames as I needed. These guys are awesome!</Review>

Dr. Schneider has been helping me and my family with our eye examinations and optical needs for over 15 years.  We greatly value the service and occasional emergency requirement being prioritized when there is a problem requiring emergency care.

Camarillo Vision Center is equipped with the latest diagnostic devices and the staff is well trained in using this leading edge technology to diagnose problems with our vision related health.

If we need customized eyewear we have always had a wide variety of eyewear to choose from that we can try on and have new glasses made within a week.  Same for prescription sunglasses, and ski googles with prescription inserts.

Thanks to Dr Schneider and his exceptional team of eyewear specialist and technicians!

I have been going to Camarillo Vision Center for a few years now. I have only had good experiences there and today was no exception. The front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. It was my first time seeing Dr. Chow, and she was great! Morgan was also very helpful with helping me pick out the perfect pair of frames, tightening my old glasses, and setting me up with all the payment information. I would definitely recommend Camarillo Vision Center to anyone in need of routine eye care services.<//Review>

The receptionist took my temperature at the front before I entered the office. It was all taken care of very promptly and efficiently.  I was just there to get my frames tightened but they could not be tightened enough because they were warped. The technician gave me new, identical frames and fit my old lenses into them. It was a very pleasant, successful visit.<//Text>

Camarillo Vision Center is awesome. I really do not leave reviews, so this tells you A LOT about the experience I had w/ them.

First, everyone in the office from the front desk to the assistants are very friendly, can't stress that anymore. The whole atmosphere is nothing but bright.

Dr. Chow is very professional, quick, detail-oriented, and efficient at what she does. My whole hour there went by so smooth. No hiccups w/ anything.

I recommend everyone needing any vision work done to go here. If you don't and go elsewhere, you are missing out on the best customer service and optometrists.

Thank you to everyone @Camarillo Vision Center. You guys are the best!</Text>

Unfortunately, due to HIPAA laws, we're unable to discuss the depths of a visit online. However, if you have concerns you'd like to address, please don't hesitate to give our office a call.  -Dr. Marty S."}<//response><Text>As a Marine Corps family, we have been away from our home town for over 25 years.
As a mother, my job is to find the best of the best when it comes to the providers that I entrust to examine my children.
With all the positive reviews, I thought I had done just that!
The staff was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  They were very kind and receptive.
We waited for Dr. Schneider for over 25 minutes past our appointment time.  Why?  Because he was busy going out of his way for an older "upper class" woman who was being overly repetitive about her concerns towards contact lenses.
Dr. Schneider finally walks in our room.  He, unlike his staff, came off as rude and dismissive when I was trying to explain my daughter's medical history with him.  Afterall, this was our new patient visit.  During my explanation, he kept interrupting me by asking how my daughter's unexplained seizures were of any relevance to him.  I was furious to say the least!
I expected the same courtesy that he had given to the woman before us.  He did not extend the same politeness or patience that he had with his previous
client.  He actually rushed through our whole exam!  Why?  Because the lady prior to us made him late for all his other clients.  We may not look wealthy, but I can assure you, we are a wealthy and highly educated family.  We do not go out of our way to flaunt it like most people In order to recieve "special" treatment.
I will NEVER visit your store again!
Oh, and that $39 out of pocket exam you offer with your fancy machine, is not so special AT ALL!  Our Texas optometrist, DR. VIRDEN, included that exam and so much more to ALL her patients at no additional out of pocket cost.  It was all submitted to our insurance and paid for, by them, with ease!</Text>< UserId.>

But his patience and expertise changed that. The front office and back office are always helpful and on top of their game, when it comes to your insurance or any other questions you have.

Thank you Dr. Marty Schneider & staff for taking good care of me. Professional, caring & friendly. Dr. Marty took all the time to explain to me the issues I have with my vision and the problem behind the entirety of my eyes. I highly recommend Camarillo Vision Center to people looking for vision services. Going back for an annual check up!!!🤩</Review>

<text>Marty always goes above and beyond to help me with my crazy demands. I wear bifocal contacts and want to see perfectly both near and far which is close to impossible, but Marty takes the time to work with me to fine tune my contacts or glasses to get me the best vision possible.<//text>< pics>

We arrived early because we're new patients and wanted to allot some extra time for paperwork.  Well, we were RUDELY greeted by the bleach bottle blonde in the front to wait.  Nowhere to sit, me and my three kids stood in the middle of this store waiting for the receptionist to finish typing on the computer.  In and out of the back of the store THREE TIMES, our appointment was finally over an hour and a half later.  BUT NO, someone, whom we hadn't dealt with the entire time there told us that we had to wait ten more minutes.  TWENTY MINUTES LATER and we're told she made an error and we could have left twenty minutes ago.

Service was questionable when came in with a check engine light but car running fine. Told replace fuel manifold but when did research found most common issues are sensors, took to another place and even sensor found good just dirty reset light and never came back on. Before this service here was good just think they was trying to take advantage.  Either way unacceptable.</text>

I purchased a certified preowned and have had nothing but problems with the vehicle and most importantly the dealership. Multiple issues I have taken the car in for and they said they fixed but immediately did not work or I knew they didn't actually perform the job correctly if at all. Do not buy from them and do not have servicing done from this location. I have talked to numerous VW owners in the antelope valley and they, who are die hard VW enthusiasts said they would never go here.< /Review>

Being military we purchased our Atlas from overseas via the Military Auto Sales. Our pick up location was Antelope Valley VW. My husband made an appointment for our pick-up on November 26th. We arrived and they were not ready for us because whom ever took his appointment forgot to pass the paperwork forward, we had to wait two hours before it I was ready, mind you we had already driving two and a half hours to get there. We did not mind too much since we had planed errands, but this is the first of a comedy of errors and mistakes. Once we received our vehicle and temporary plates we were told to be on the lookout for our permanent plates.
Here we are into 6 months later and our temporary tags having expired and oh so many calls, left but neck we returned voicemails, and waiting we still do not have the plates. Why you may ask, because our consultant, Joe, we discovered after visiting the “local” DMV, another 45 minutes drive for us, we learned that our paperwork had never been submitted by the dealership. More calls later and many unanswered voicemails we finally get ahold of Joe and he realizes the paperwork was miss placed but found but would be turned into their DMV representative. This was in March. Many moons once again pass and we continue to check on the status and eventually are told the paperwork was submitted and we should receive the plates in about 10 business days. This was in April, but alas, they never arrived. We finally learned this week, May 10th after finally being forwarded to Jenny, the woman who handles the DMV paperwork that she has yet to receive our paperwork. Only today, May 14th was she able to call me back and inform me that she has the paperwork in hand, it will be submitted and expedited to us. This has been terribly inconvenient us and Joe was unprofessional as he did not complete the tasks of his job and even lied to us about the paperwork being submitted before now.<//text>

I just purchased a 2021 Atlas and have been having issues with it already. In typical sales fashion the car salesman just transferred me to service department without any care of the issue.</Review>

<Review>I came here with an open mind to see what I can get and I definitely got that and much more than I expected, I wanted to shout out Mr. Anthony Franco for doing everything he could to get me approved and for all the knowledge he had about my vehicle he went above and beyond my expectation I purposely asked difficult questions about the vehicle to see if he knew and his professionalism blew me away, I truly recommend working with him I know I’m sending anyone I can in his direction!! Not to mention I got a 200,000 mile warranty or 20 years that it’s self made the deal worth it, thank you guys for all the help!!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>I have taken my 2016 Jetta to the AV Volkswagen on 2 occasions in the last 4 weeks due to used vehicle issues. Each time the service department attendant, sorry cant remember her name, was more than courteous, professional and extremely helpful. She knew what the issues were with my car and how to correct them as I was standing there explaining them, even if the Cole machine was empty. :) That meant a lot to me as I knew she had knowledge of the vehicle. The technicians did a great job and I couldn't be more pleased with the service department.

Wow... SMH, I can't believe this is how they treat paying customers with car problems. Stay far away from this dealership. Oh boy, this one is a winner. The service manager was getting all animal kingdom posturing on me when I came in to have them check out a safety problem.

Didn't even give me a chance before he started trying to intimidate me with his big-chested bully bravado, claiming I was the bully. That was amazing, I thought it only happened in the wild.

Plus, oh, the Focker two-finger eyeball stare, it was truly meme worthy. Wow VW, is this what you call professional?

They will smile in your face, and then point you to the fine print after you've bought it. They sent two thugs to my door thinking I owed something because they couldn't keep their paperwork straight about contact information.

Update April 23rd, the dealership is failing to provide a loaner car, so that my vehicle can be serviced and repaired. This is a safety sensor issue, and they are refusing to provide a vehicle until it's convenient for them.

This dealership has cool maintenance/service staff, the phone staff is sub-par, and sales staff will return you call once in a while if it benefits them. They have very poor document chain control, and their phone system was done by amateurs.

I do not recommend buying a Volkswagen. NTSB Safety report has been filed. They are not currently quality vehicles. I am now stuck with this 2018 Passat. Many corners were cut, literally... They couldn't even spare an extra half inch of extra fabric so it would stay under the side moulding. Many safety feature issues, and sensor failures under barely icy conditions.<//Text>

Bought a car recently from AV Volkswagen and Matthew Mata made it a very enjoyable experience for me.  I'd say from pulling into the lot and leaving with a car was about 2-3 hrs, the longest wait being them washing and set detailing the car for me before I leave.  Came back the next day for final payment and they refilled my tank for me.  Matthew is very professional and made everything quick and easy.  Top seller in my book.<//review>< resp>

Great service and selection. I was able to test drive 3 used vehicles I had on my list and decided I preferred the Volkswagen Tiguan. Andrew was able to work to get me the price I needed for my budget without being too pushy. Jose and Joe especially were very knowledgeable and friendly.  This dealer went above my expectations to make sure I got a great car. 😁🚗<//review>

<Text>On the phone I asked for an out the door price with 100k warranty. I was very specific and clear. They gave me the price and also the amount I would be financing. I drove over an hour to get to the dealership. They were very nice when I got there but then the problems started. They started messing around and said that the out the door price was without tax, registration and warranty. After a couple of exchanges with the sales manager and the dealership manager I left. Didn’t appreciate being lied to.< /Text>< pictures>

When you were quoted an out the door price we quoted you a cash purchase price. We weren’t aware at that time that you were interested in financing the vehicle.

< review>
Car buying can be an intimidating process, so when I went in I didn't know what to expect from the various reviews I've read. I met with Stephanie and though she announced she was new she let me know that she either had the answers I was looking for or she would find them for me. She continued to demonstrate a very professional and personable demeanor throughout the process. Greatly appreciated! Would recommend you stop by!</review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>So I used their online shopper tool. Worked everything out through that. The car was priced at $16,577 online. They adjusted the deal online and they told me to look at the deal. When I opened the link to my deal the car was suddenly priced at $18995 and there was an extra charge of over $2300 for 'certification fees'. I told them that I would not be purchasing it because their pricing was deceiving. I was told that their General Sales Manager would like to talk to me because there was obviously a misunderstanding on my part. Not sure what that misunderstanding could be because I wanted to purchase the car at the advertised price not the price inflated by $5000. So at a minimum I would be careful dealing with these folks. Or better yet look at VWs at another dealership.<//review>< Pics>

I went in recently searching for a new family car and was greeted by Stephanie, she showed me the car that I wanted to see yet she had suggestions of her own. I must say I was very impressed by her patience, kindness & customer service. I am very pleased and would recommend her to my family & dear friends. Thank you Stephanie bless your heart!<//review>

<name>enosrevlah< /name><text>This is the best car buying experience I've ever had. Phillip was great at listening to what my wife and I wanted in a car and showed us several cars that had the features we were looking for, and Andrew was more than willing to work with us on the price of the car we wanted. We did have to return the next day to have a faulty headlight bulb changed since the Service Department was closed at the time, but we were in and out fairly quickly.

All in all, we ended up driving away with a car that we really love. We can't thank the guys at Antelope VW enough for their time and patience, and we'll definitely be returning in the future.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>came into the dealership not ready to make a final decision about a vehicle since i wasn’t sure which make felt right for me , but i was helped by Stephanie and she understood my situation and still took the time to show me around and made me feel like i wasn’t a waste of time since i wasn’t set on a certain car or buying right then and there . She was very helpful and even though i didn’t take home a car on that visit, she convinced me on choosing Volkswagen over other dealerships I’ve visited . I will definitely be coming back and have her help me when I’m ready to purchase my new car ! I am now excited to be one step closer to being an owner of a Volkswagen soon !< /review><resp>None<//resp></record>

I went in to go check out a vehicle at VW a few weeks ago, Jose Gonzalez attended me right away and answered every question I had about the vehicle. Jose was very knowledgeable and patient. He didn’t make me feel pressured into buying, which to me made it a very positive experience. I would highly recommend speaking to Jose if you’re looking to buy a car!< /review>

As many people can relate, buying a car is a difficult decision to make as you cannot simply say I didn’t like it after all let’s return it. I walked in just thinking I was going to look around to get some type of idea to what car I would like. As I approached, Stephanie came up to me and offered her assistance. She was great answering/finding answers to any question I could possibly have. She was very helpful and helped make a decision on what car I was going to take home. Stephanie made the decision process a lot easier than expected. I would definitely recommend her for your buying decisions.<//text>

Great all around experience.  Roger a very professional salesperson that will give you all the information you need and listens to the customer.

If I could give this no stars I would. Went in to trade in a car, MIKE was EXTREMELY RUDE. There is a way to talk to someone and then there is how he spoke to me. Terrible, you can see his body language when he speaks to his employees around him. Do not go here I never write reviews even with a bad experience but this felt personal.< /text>

Recently purchased a vehicle here and not only do I love the car, I love the service that I received from Roger La Prairie, Joe VW, and the finance team. Fun test-drive, great service, and an easy transaction. I highly recommend these guys.</Text>

I haven't bought a car here but I always get my VW serviced here. I have never experienced the level of customer service that I experience here at any type of establishment anywhere ever. Never had a bad experience.</Review>

Very pleased with the customer service I received here. Everybody was super friendly and helpful. Izzy and Sy, especially were great.
UPDATE:
Changed my rating due to promises made, then not kept, and they accused me of lying. Get everything in writing! My mistake sadly.</Text>

Last week stopped by to test drive a Jetta and was greeted by a saleswoman named Stephanie with a smile. I had done my research in the vehicle I wanted. Loved how she was able to tell me things I already knew and actually made me aware of a few things I didn't see in reviews about the vehicle. Just had to write this review because I've been to other dealers I own 3 cars and I've never felt so good leaving a dealer. When im ready to buy I will definitely see Stephanie. Highly recommend her if you want honesty and a true smile.<//review>

Very nice staff good service department. BUT! Do not let them wash your car. The car wash guys are doing something really wrong. It's as if they are not using soap and spearing dirt and water like sandpaper. Or they are using dirty rags with metal shavings in it. I've had my car cilajet and have had it detailed and waxed many times, and I have never seen as much damage come back from anywhere but they're free wash service. I have let them wash it 3 times and had nothing but regret. And there is no point of pointing anything out because the generic excuses it could be "Rock chips and scratches from the highways" or my favorite "people only notice things after work was done because that is the only time people look closely at their vehicle." I walk around my car every other day looking for damage.</text>

Go see Phillip at AV Volkswagen! Thank you Philip for helping me purchase my brand new Jetta. It was a way different experience then previous from other dealerships  I have been to.  He has great product knowledge and was able to choose me the perfect car that fit my needs and my budget. I didn't feel pressured into anything and he worked with me every step of the way! Phillip even helped me get more money for my trade-in and keeps in contact long after the delivery just to see how I am doing. It was a fun and exciting experienc< /text>

< review>
This isn’t the kind of car dealer you want to deal with please try a different VW lot. I’ve had two Volkswagens before which one was bought brand new from another dealer. The salesman here was awesome and I can’t say anything negative about him (sorry I’ve forgotten your name).
But the bad part is the lies here. In no particular order: paperwork ready to sign and finance clerk/manager tries to slip a two thousand dollar warranty in without a word then cannot tell me exactly what the warranty that comes standard is for. I thought VW had an outstanding warranty to start. But don’t ask these guys. They put three hard inquires on my credit report even though they promised they wouldn’t I have an over 800 credit score and work hard to maintain it. And then I was told I had to finance through VW by the finance manager which is fine but the interest rate was 8% (maybe a little lower but nothing I would consider financing at anyway) but could refinance before the first payment somewhere else just to get the deal. Turns out that was a lie when I mentioned the plan to the GM.
In short just a sleazy way to do business especially in a day when car shoppers have so many options. I went in for a cheap used Jetta and almost left with a brand new one. The salesman can really sell but the finance and management team ruin it for them.<//review>

I will let you decide whether to shop here or not.  Andrew the dealership finance manager and I agreed on a sale price.  I then allowed them to run my credit to see if they could beat my credit union interest rate.  When he came back with numbers they were way off.  I asked why he had added all the additional warranties and he stated that most people want them.  After this I was very weary of continuing our transaction.  He then came back and changed the agreed sale price by $970, which I asked him about and he said he could not change the price after all.  I told him we have a written and verbal agreement to which my wife, Jose (Salesman), and myself were witness too and he said it didn't matter.  I left very upset and decided to call Edgar the store manager and he accused me of lying based on what Andrew the finance manager had told him.  Edgar stated that Andrew was not authorized to discount cars so that would not have happened.  I was also upset about the hard inquiry affecting my credit but according to Edgar it has little to not effect, so I was not losing out on anything.  I spent four hours at this dealership! This was a horrible experience, so buyer beware. I will be filing a complaint with the FTC.< /Text>

<text>I have been a happy customer of AV Volkswagen for quite a while now, Daniel Serrano in Parts, Shamus in Service, and now Daniel Hendricks in Sales has taken care of me by selling and assisting me with a purchase of a pre-owned 2013 Jetta SportWagen TDI (to go along with our current 2013 Jetta TDI) and a flawless transition at that. Daniel Hendricks was with me the whole way through the purchase and made sure that every detail was taken care of, this had to be to date the best car buying experience that I have had. A++++ treatment and service. Daniel made sure that the car was fully fueled, cleaned, and from every light to every part he made sure that nothing was broken or missing. (I must also mention the manager Edgar and Carlos in finance for taking care of my needs with the extended warranty)
I was treated like a family member and that goes a long way - If you are looking to purchase either a new or pre-owned vehicle I recommend going to AV Volkswagen and seeing this group of individuals, and request Daniel Hendricks for your sales representative, you won't be disappointed!< /text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>
<resp>None<//resp><review>Bought a car here last month and it came with a faulty battery. The car just died and it won't hold charge. I took it into service at the dealership, and they said that they couldn't help me with it, but if I wanted to I could purchase one of their batteries for $200. I explained to them that I just had bought the car, and obviously they knew that already, but they didn't seem to care. All they seem to care about was selling me a new battery for $200. I trusted that the vehicle would be perfectly fine when i bought it. And even then, i bought an extended warranty for the vehicle, and even then,  they wouldn't issue me a new battery. Im really disappointed.</review>< time>

So I called Tuesday to make an appointment for an oil change and a tire rotation. The Service guy told me anytime is a good so I said great Thursday about 4:00 pm is that good, he said yes. So I showed for my appointment sorry we can't help because we don't have any technician that can help you right because they finishing up other cars. I wasn't mad I was just disappointed greatly, but before I left they told come tomorrow at 3:00 or 3:30 I was okay.

Today is Friday I decided to call first I was the phone 15 minutes and nobody answered the phone from service department. I still showed up to dealership to see if I can get help just only to do an oil change. The service guy was on the phone with a customer okay I give him that no problem! But he never acknowledged me or told good afternoon sir I'll be right with you in a minute just nothing! It's not Shamiis (great service from him) it's the bald head dude that looks he is always piss off and hates his job, also has that look that he thinks he better than everybody else(meathead). Stood there for maybe about 5 minutes and mind you he is also the one who told me come back tomorrow at 3:00 or 3:30 at the latest. It's was 3:30 when I left the dealership!

Just horrible!!!<//text>

Bunch of crooks, made a deal with me over the phone, I told them It would take me an hour to drive over there from LA. Once I arrived their story and price changed, I spent another hour fighting with the managers Sammy and some bearded guy. Finally I told them to match the same price of another dealer, when they saw the price they said no because they would be losing money. Well if another dealer can sell it and make a profit I’m sure AV Vw could too. You’ve been warned don’t bother wasting your time by these crooks.<//Text>

This Volkswagen dealership does not even deserve 1 star!! This place is not only deceitful, but they are incredibly disrespectful! I went in with a flyer that was mailed to me this afternoon. I was greeted by a lovely young lady named Brittney. I showed her my flyer and was excited to collect my winnings. She asked me if I was going to purchase a car. I told her I wasn't sure yet, the flyer states I do not have to purchase anything in order to collect my winnings. She had me follower inside and sit down. She asked me for some info and then asked if she could run my credit report. I was confused because I hadn't gotten my prize yet nor did I even look at a car.  When I asked again about my winnings she told me that, the flyer is misleading because the code on the flyer had to match the code on the board. Huh? Then takes me outside to the lot where the" board" was located. Which was inside a new car! So now I realized that I have been lied to three times!! So I said thank you to Brittney and was leaving, she said well would you like the $5.00 gift card from Walmart. So I figured sure why not, I go back inside with her and now I am approached by a man who askes me how I was. I told him, that I was annoyed and upset that the flyer is so misleading that it actually is lieing. He tried to tell me that if I read the flyer it clearly states I have to match the board. So I showed him the flyer, expressed total dissatisfaction, and that I was going to the BBB. He looked at me and said "we are not in the business to just give away money" put up his hand, walled away saying "I'm done talking to you"  I was mortified that he spoke to me that way with a showroom full of people. He might as well have said "look lady your an idiot if you thought you won anything, get out of my store if your not buying"  The younge lady Brittney, stood there in amazement as well and tried to apologize for the mans behavior.  I am shocked how I was treated today, never mind the deceitful flyer that's how some people do business ... there is always that running joke about car salesman lol... but he was not just rude he was down right demeaning to me.< /Review>

By far worst dealership.. Stay far away if you value customer service. The sales managers are the type that give car salesmen a bad name. This dealership should be ashamed for hiring such rude and unethical people to represent their dealership. Purely shamefull.< /Review>

So i came in today to get a oil change and i had other problems with my car and i get there and was told i had to pay a 150 diagnosis and may have to pay for parts and labor if my problems arent covered under my warranty. A couple months ago i bought a warranty for 100k milege bumper to bumper which meant if anything goes wrong with my car i wouldnt have to pay for it thats why i payed 6k for my extended warranty. So i then asked which items where and where not covered and they told me they dont know until i buy the diagnosis, so then i asked to speak to a manager in regards to my warranty and i was suppose to talk to a women named lisa but instead they brough out bret. Bret was absolutley no help he brought me a brochure and told me to read over it and i then told him i would like to sit down and go over my warranty because when i was sold the warranty the seller told me it would cover everything and i get here and they tell me otherwise. Then bret showed no type of concern and had me waiting for about two hours but kept comming back and fourth to me telling me one second. so then i go up to him explaining how i have patiently waited for an answer and he still showed no concern and lied about helping me. i then became very annoyed with the lies and back and fourth in regards to my warranty i payed 6k for, for absolutley no reason. then i went back up to him and asked for there booklet on there bumper to bumper then told me he didnt have one. Which again was a lie, if u guys sell then all the time how do u not have a brochure of it. so i then asked him for all the extended warrantys they had on preowned cars and he never came back with any. My car got finished and i ended up just leaving. these people show absolute no concern for any of there customers especially have buying two cars from them . im literally disgusted with them and theres service and thats absolutley unacceptable< /Text>

<review>Joshua Hulling  what can I say other than thanks. Thank you for helping us find the perfect car for us and really listening to what our concerns were. It was nice being able to wait with you rather than for you ( while the numbers were getting worked out) . I can honestly say my experience with VW Palmdale, CA was GREAT and will be seeing you again for our next car purchase!</review>< Pics>

We were in the market for a smaller car, and after testing the prius and the civic we went to look at a jetta. The staff here were great to us and not pushy like the other dealerships in town. The jetta felt like a overall better product for us than the previous cars. The guys here helped us get a great deal on a new jetta se and we love it so far. I would most certainly recommend this dealership to anyone. One of the best dealer experiences I've had to date.</Text>

VW Palmdale are the best. I came in to get  a car for my wife and Matthew really helped me out. He was really professional. He made this experience really easy. We walked away with 2014 Passat TSI and my wife loves her car. So a couple of weeks later I grabbed myself a 2014 Jetta TDI. Love this car. Those guys really hooked me up. Thanks again guys love my cars.<//Text>

I purchased my 2012 Volkswagen Jetta TDI today in Palmdale. I love the staff and salespeople. Everyone  is so thoughtful kind and courteous. Andrew is great and gets the job done while working with your budget, awesome and outstanding salesman in my book. And I also want to thank Joe, Jose and Sammy for their kind courtesy.
No long 5 or 6 hour wait, I'd say
3.5 hours max
Thank you AV Volkswagen for my
2012 Volkswagen Jetta TDI

My concern is that this guys sold me a car with a wrong handbook plus a broken button thats used to change the time . Im very dissapointed im not happy with the car at all when i seen it was bigger  now i feel like a sardine in a can. I can say they swicthed out my cars over nite because the bank was closed when i went n i had to return the next day for it. I took it for a service appt. They did not fix nothing completely unprofessionals i would say . Like really u dint notice the time was not correct when u gave hand me keys for it. Im over this car already n never gona purchase another car from here they just lie all they want is the money. The day of my service they took all day n when i went to get it they just handed me the key n dint even bother to show me where it was parked at.  I called them n they dont care they said it was a new car but already had 250 miles on it which they never said that. N now they tell me if i want to change it i need to pay down payment for another car do the process all over again. Yea rite i would rather go to av nissan even if they did sell me a truck that had a bad radiator defect n they knew about it n still sold them like that. Nope never again with this Volkswagen ppl. The service deparment is worser then sierra toyota n i tod they were bad they good compare to this ppl. No wonder is allways lonely.< /Text>

I heard a noise in the motor I didn't recognize, but I know any weird noise in the motor means something out of my league to diagnose so I took it to the vw dealer an sure enough they found out what it was and fix it for a reasonable price I got peace of mind.</Review>

wish I read the reviews before coming here for service. Big mistake.

My Passat had a check engine light come on and I should have known better than to have come in to a dealership considering that I work at one and the main function of them is to take every last dollar you have. Anyways brought my car in, they tell me it's gonna be $150 to check it out. I ask for a rental, they have them but non there. They send me to enterprise. I ask for a courtesy shuttle. The guy takes about 20 mins and he comes walking up in street clothes, looking high as can be .Whatever...says they are shorthanded and he's not even the shuttle driver. Really assuring.

Get to enterprise, Antelope valleyVolkswagen said nothing to them about me being sent there. I get their last car. The lamest KIA base model. I brought in a 2014 wolfburg tsi passat. And im in a really inexpensive car. Ugh whatever!

Get a call my car is going to be $1500 to fix!! Pissed I agree to the repairs. They end up calling me back later, telling me it's going to be $2400 now!! They had my car for a whole week and ended up charging me about $2300 for everything. Then I had to pay enterprise another $180 for my rental! They didnt cover anything or work out a cheaper deal for me! After i spent $2300!! This place is a joke. They told me they had courtesy loaner cars that's why I even came here I need a car to get to work. Then i get there, they have none. Come to find out the dealership only has 2! And they have been out on loan for a month each already. For a TDI recall they say. So theres your redflag there. A month long repair. I feel bad for those customers. My car had 2 recalls out for it. My repair cost ended up nearly doubling, and they could care less unless you're buying a car There.

The service manager Bret Hart is a very rude grumpy man and when I was asking him to explain the repairs a little better his response was a blank stare and "didn't the technician tell you?" Ummmm no man he didn't you are the MANAGER HERE. Said he wouldn't do anything for me and that "this is a business!" Hahah yeah clearly. One that doesn't care for customers. He seriously couldn't answer 1 question I asked. No joke. Just seriously stared at me with an empty soul. Not sure how someone thought he was a good fit for this position. He honestly said this to me, "well yeah we offer courtesy loaner vehicles, but the cost just gets added to you're repair bill." Ummmm what?! That's not courtesy anything that's just charging me anyways! Lol!!

Asked to speak to the general manager when I left and of course no reply or response. This has been about a week now. Apparently the general manager never is actually here?
Dodging my calls.

They are rude when they talk to you and some other customer satisfactory agent or whoever told me that the rentals were free and then this other lady service advisor Monica says that they are $35 a day! Seriously?! About 3 different excuses /stories from different employees about the rental policy.

There's about 10 dealerships within about 150 feet of you! I'm sure they all offer free loaner cars to customers considering they are spending a FEW GRAND THERE. This isn't an oil change, this was a couple thousand dollars I spent for repairs.

With all this TDI nonsense and this diesel issues surrounding Volkswagen and fraud, I wouldn't be surprised if they just price gouged me or took advantage of my situation. Between that and the recalls It's no wonder Volkswagen is losing customer backing and all around faith. Their customer relations are a joke.

Take your business elsewhere and avoid this place like the plague. If I could give 0 stars I would be doing so.< /review>

It is the best service I have seen. I have 335 BMW and the service I get at this dealership is less than Antelope valley VW dealer. I decide lease new Passat and the sales do not match the service department. I went in the dealership to get some prices on a lease. I ask for Joe Clunich  but to busy so I got Joshua in sales. Joshua did  a great job but Joe was to busy to sit down and talk with me on a lease. I decided to walk out. Told them to email lease deal. I received a call 7 days later that Joe found time to get to me. I didn't bother to call back. It is was of time if this is how they do business.
My advise is buy your car elsewhere and take it to the service at Anelope Valley VW.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c259c9d74fe5bb:0x8d509de5d76297ee<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Well, I really loved my experience buying my new 2016 Jetta at Antelope Valley Volkswagen. Everyone at AV Volkswagen were so helpful. Each process was completely enjoyable from the selection process, negotiation, financial, and signing. First there was Izzy. He just was fantastic. Ismael ("Izzy") Contreras walked me through, he helped me choose just exactly the right vehicle. He explained all my options. He absolutely did not rush me. It was a relaxed experience. Izzy really brought out the best in me while I took my journey through the car buying experience. I have to add too, he has been there for me when I had questions about the connectivity, the applications, everything about my car, he made it so easy, he's so knowledgeable about all the new features, just awesome. Eddie Sirriyea in finance was very flexible and I negotiated and great price and they were so fair with my trade-in. I mean, super super fair. I got a really really great deal. I got the upgrades I wanted, every single one, it was worked into my deal very nicely. After my final decision was made, we went over to Sy Khalili. He took me through the contract process, made me aware of everything, it just really flowed. You know how sometimes you feel like you're sitting and signing forever, well it wasn't like that it was a real pleasure he is such a great guy, everyone there is. I can't say enough about the vehicle. I'm completely happy with my new car, I love it. My 2016 Jetta has been just a joy to drive, it's incredible. It's been six weeks and I still have not come down off my new car cloud. I would recommend Antelope Valley Volkswagen to anyone looking to get into something new or pre-owned. I love my new car!!!!!< /Text>

<text>This place is the most dishonest dealership I've ever been to. The sales people such as Izzy and Andy Cortez the manager are extremely sleazy and are not honest about the whole process. Overall, save yourself a headache and avoid this place like the plague. It's rather sad how VW is going down the path of deception and dishonesty.</text>< Pictures>

A wide variety, really cool park with alot of diversity packed into a pretty small park. I really enjoyed the snake run, the bigger bowl, and the green curb bank. This park has 2 large bowls, snake run, great transitions, banks, rails, ledges, wall ride, and more.< /Text>

This place is Good.
Fun to Roll around. Well made. Smooth.
I think they recently did an acid wash there.

It has a big bowl near the entrance, with pool coping that still needs to be replaced. It's maybe 5 and a half feet deep in the shallow end. Almost goes to Vert. The deep end is maybe 12- 13 feet deep. Goes to Vert.

The middle section is Fun. All these spots to roll in, and out.

In the back is another smaller bowl.

Plenty of parking in the parking lot.
Bathrooms right outside the Skatepark. Not sure about lights.

Good, Fun Spot.
Worth checking out.< /review>

This skatepark is huge ! Not as In a ton of space, but the ramps are massive. The park itself is pretty spacious though. This is by far one of the best skateparks to learn and build up your confidence!< /Text>

There's something for everyone at this park. Tennis courts, basketball courts, baseball field, soccer field, swimming pool, playground, covered picnic tables with grills, bathrooms, and a sherrifs station. They also offer classes and sports for kids. And that is only one of two blocks of the park. The other block has a lake and my favorite a Los Angeles county library.</Text>

<review>Hated it. It's better to go to the beach or stay home even of its hot. Cops in training barking at your every move. Maybe because it's free they feel they can treat you badly. Had the feel of a concentration camp with no beatings & no guns to your head.< /review>< pics>

We love this park! We have been coming here for years. Its a great place to soak up some sun enjoy a bike ride or walk around the fishing pond. There is a farmers market every Saturday. Music events, fishing durbies and a community christmas toy drive. There is 2 age apropriate play grounds.< /Text>

Jeff was an excellent host. There was another guy there but he didn’t really seem interested in helping a noob like myself.

I walked in the store with my 6 year old son to do some browsing, this was after leaving empty handed at 3 other stores. I was looking for my first driver. I asked for the price of a used one and Jeff graciously showed me a few options. He immediately tried to sell me the pink set but after a short chat he reassured me there would be more options when shipment came in.

When I chose a used driver I asked for the price and he said he would go and ask his coworker. I’ve got to say 35 dollars for a dented and used driver seems a little pricey... I grabbed a couple of head covers (one for myself and one for my son’s driver at home) and I headed out.

Overall Jeff was polite, professional, and very gracious. I have read other reviews and I could definitely relate to the staring. I did like the space in the beginning but mostly I felt like I was being monitored. Once I initiated conversation Jeff started answering all my questions. Thank you, Jeff!< /Review>

<review>I left a review on Google for the first time. Worst golf shop. Terrible. When they sell the product, it's over, and they don't care about the customer at all. In particular, one of the high-pressure and unkind employees is questioning how he continues to do the job.  I wasted a lot of time and effort because of this strange golf shop. It was an experience that I would never want to experience again. When I told my friend this shop, my friend recommended 'The Golf Mart' by saying, "it is notorious place." I went to  'The Golf Mart' in Camino del
Rio to repair my club and it was so kind and fantastic. In the future, I will use Golf mart. Remember that you may regret later if you buy something at Fairway Golf.</review>< pictures>

<Text>I showed up looking to upgrade my irons and immediately after walking in, Jeff was there and ready to help. I told him the irons I was looking into and he was great in allowing me to use their ultra cool swing simulator. He even gave me a few swing tips that will help me in the future. I will definitely be back! Keep up the great work gentlemen!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1603128700988, 'text': 'Thank you for your support Brandon !

This is my first review on google maps because of how horrendous we were treated at this store. Warning to all WOMEN considering shopping here. My wife needed her grips changed and the man assisting us continued to snicker and scoff at every question she asked. He embodied disrespect that is unacceptable for customer service regardless of experience level. My wife has played golf for 20 years and he treated her as if she knew nothing. There was an obvious contrast when the same sales clerk treated the next customer, a middle aged Caucasian male, as if he was a king answering similar questions about golf grips. To make things worse, the prices were almost double for the same grips from a nearby store. Once we gave them our clubs they didn’t clarify pricing and had a very poorly marked selection. Dishonest and terrible service, please reconsider before coming here.<//text>

Recently I needed a couple putters bent more upright and some new grips put on, but apparently the machine that GolfMart had that does that, was out of commission, so I decided to try Fairway Golf, and am very glad I did. The place is not as big as GolfMart, but the space they have is packed with a good selection of clubs and clothing. The staff is a few good guys that know the game and are easy to talk to and very helpful. Thank you Dale and Pete.

<Text>I went in to get my clubs regripped and told it would be overnight and I could pick them up tomorrow. Since it was my first time there, the guy showed me around and asked if I'd like to try out some high end clubs. Of course I did. I was impressed with the Moira clubs and compared them to some of the other brands they carry. When I was done and told them I'll be back tomorrow, the club builder told me I may as well wait 5 minutes while he finishes the last two grips. Very stoked in this place and the service. I'll be back.<//Text>< Pictures>

Friday morning I got a fitting with dale for a fairway wood. The guy is a solid dude and a badass fitter. I highly recommend getting fit with him.He talked me thru every step of the way. I feel he even went above and beyond my expectations. But this not a surprise from the guys at fairway golf. I have purchased a wedge, 2 sets of irons ap2 and titliest 620 mb, and a tsi 2-3 wood. each visit was met with quality customer service and personable experience.Will definitely be going back for my future golf purchases.< /text>

I wrote a review a year ago and I promised I would never come back. I thought they had changed, shame on me. I go into the store, I am the only other customer and the clerk comes running towards me with his mask half on to check my temperature. This is two minutes after I have been looking through stuff already. They asked if I needed any help, I politely said I am just looking. I found a headcover in the 10 dollar bin, I go to pay and the guy working on the shafts yells, "hey that is not supposed to be 10 dollars. That is a 140 dollar headcover. He rips it out of my hand as if I am trying to steal it.". It was something like a Rose & Fire headcover. The clerk checking me out is on the phone dealing with another customer who just called in right when I was checking out. Then the other guy who ripped out the headcover doesn't even apologize and goes on to help another customer with a shaft problem. No attention, no apology. As I finish my check out I asked the clerk what is up with that headcover and again the other clerk gets involved. Now apologies comes up with this story that it belongs to a customer. This store is very unorganized, not helpful and they stare at you as if you are going to steal something. That is how I felt the only two times I have been there. I don't know if it's because of the color of my skin, but I never get treated right in that store. Do yourself a favor. Go to golf mart. They will go the extra mile to get you what you need. You may say, I am overreacting but this is my second time going to this store after a year and I had the same bad experience. Why does this keep happening? Can't I just be treated like a regular customer?</text>

<text>I have been coming to this store for years to get my irons re-shafted and I have also ordered from their online store, unreal deal on TM 2i,.. Here is the real deal for Convoy: Smaller shop of great fitters and great selection on clubs big name brands and boutique manufacturers. They are going to give you space to check stuff out, probably ask you once if you need help so if you do, let them know. Great sale prices on clothes from time to time youll find a real gem. Only downside is their hours but as long as you know what they are, you are good to go.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Make sure to ask their cancellation policy before placing purchase order of any iron sets from this store. Without any explanation,  they may charge you the club fitting fee ($150) if you hit few balls on the mat and the restocking fee ($67.50). Also, it will take approx. 2 weeks for them to refund.<//Review>< userid>

Best golf shop in San Diego! It looks like a small place from the outside, but inside is everything and more you could ever want from a golf shop. They stock things the other places don't. Repairs are done quick. Oh, and they sell products like Miura and Tour Scotty Camerons. Best shop in town.<//review>

Very disappointed today 10/9/16 On 10/7/16
Made a call to inquire about some Titleist grips and Vokey grips as I told the sales person I need 9 grips and one Vokey grip
I was quoted  $4 a grip and $2 to install
Great, I drove out to the store on the 9th
When I arrived, I ask the young saleman
About the Titleist grips he wasn't sure they
had any, after while he asked the other (Caucasian) sales person "not metion any names" they eventually found the grips
Now this guy is looking up the price of the grip
I told him I was quoted  $4 a grip on the phone
He quoted me $10 a grip and proceeded
to tell me ebay prices, at this point his attitude  was noncaring! Terrible customer service, pertty much both sale people walked away
I was considering purchasing the Titleist MB or the AP2s irons but they weren't interested.
I been coming to Fairway golf since the beginning when you guy were located the othe end of Convoy st.
Like I said the beginning very disappointed!!!!!
Know where your products in the store and your prices before customers make a trip,
P.S.....you do have Ping putter covers!

<review>I fell off my bicycle and spent 5 weeks in the hospital so with what's left of my brain I thought maybe I will give up cycling and go back to golf.

Dr told me that I lost about 30% of my memories but I remembered (falsely?) I was a 4 handicap and I thought I just pick up where I left off with golf.  WRONG. With a busted left shoulder I was not able to swing my old clubs and I needed a new set of...everything.  As it turned out, the busted left shoulder slowed my swing down considerably and my old S-flex clubs felt as harsh as my ex-wife's face in divorce court (too bad I remembered that one, brrr...).  But I am keeping my 21 year old putter. I did retain some great memories with the old Scotty Cameron.

I tried every brand ranging from R-felx, R2-flex even lady's flex but while I lost a lot of my flexibility I still do remember the basic mechanics of a golf swing and that made me an "advanced-beginner" which is very difficult place to be in terms of finding correct clubs. My requirements for my clubs became a bit of an anomaly. I remember how to swing a club properly but just slower and the timing was still correct. I needed a soft flex shaft that can still have the proper torque to handle a good follow-thru.

My friend, Frank, came back from a trip to Japan and brought back a Japan spec XXIO9 with Japan specific shaft in red.  I tried it and they were just right!  But how do I get a set like that? Going to Japan is out of the question then I found Fairway Golf USA.

Are you kidding me?  There is a golf store like this?!?!?!

I must admit that in the beginning I was a bit hesitant.  I mean, c'mon, give them my money up front and wait and see if my clubs show up??? I may have brain injury but I am still...ok, I gave them my money then sat down and wait for my clubs.

It was a nerve racking 1.5 weeks (not that long if we take out the weekend days) and I received email update as to where the package was; in Japan store, In Japan post office, arrived USA, cleared custom, in LA post office (sat in LA post office for a few days doing lor'-knows-what). I came home one day and saw the post office we-tried-to-deliver-but no1-was-home slip. I ripped it off the front door and drove around in my neighborhood trying to track down the post lady.  Against all odds, I found her and the box was in my hands in minutes.  Went home, opened it and there they were my brand new XXIO9 Japan-spec SIFF-REGULAR flex in gorgeous red.  They were like tailor-made (sry) for me and I am now able to hit shots like I used to.

My trust in Fairway Golf is now all good and I decided to order XXIO9 grips with red caps also only from Japan.  The grips came within a week and they are beautiful. Now I am eyeing a few Japan spec fairway woods and hybrids. Now I have Fairway Golf Japan is just a few computer clicks away.

I have good faith in Fairway Golf and if the need arises I will not hesitate to order what I need from it.  I wonder if Japan makes golf helmets.</review><Resp>None</Resp>< date>

< Review>
The fitting experience could be tightened up.  In fact, I left a bad review over the process and then regretted it.  It seems that the store is going to allow me to make an exchange.  This is outstanding customer service.  Not everything or anybody is perfect, but these guys are going out of their way to make me happy.  Thanks, that goes a long way and I look forward to telling my friends that I had a good experience.<//Review>

<date>1592008021036< /date><Text>(Translated by Google) There's a manager who isn't very friendly and shows a little detail. The service for the purchased product is insufficient when returning after purchasing.
I picked the right club for an hour and a half of personal fitting, but I was not satisfied, so I decided to just play in Korea. It was customer management that gave a lot of regret. The expression and tone that are unfortunate are still good for my head. Anyway

<review>The hamburger arrived late with bun and meat, nothing else! $9.00! For a dollar more my friend's cheesburger came with lettuce, tomato, special sauce. So what's up ;with that? In many restaurants the burger tastes really special. Here, it's like dead cow! I did not like the taste.
I asked for water. "We really don't serve water except for bottled." Thanks!
But the ambiance was nice.</review>< rate>

Stopped by here after walking around the La Brea Tar Pits and needed to rest. The giant copper balloon animal statue (outside of the nearby art museum ) attracted us here. Lots of different selections of gourmet pastries, and I love that they use a tamp and tap esspresso machine. It tastes so much better that way. I was also very impressed with how strong their espresso was!< /Text>

<text>Dropped by the LACMA today, and grabbed a quick bite at Coffee and Milk. I had a prepackaged Fiesta Taco Salad from the company GROW • EEN. It had taco walnut meat in it. This was my first time trying that, and it was really good. I enjoyed the latte C&M made. It wasn’t too sweet. It was pretty perfect. The staff was ok. Not very talkative but they made a good latte. The pumpkin spice chocolate chip cookies were really good, too. There’s a nice seating area inside, and outside by the museum.

Tip: They didn’t provide a lid or straw for their drinks, and I couldn’t see napkins anywhere. You may need to ask them for them.

Tip 2: They accept Apple Pay.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b93c95ef336d:0xeefec388dca90b93< /Gmap_id><user>105243627149104621551< /user>< pictures>

The wait staff are perfectly snobby. The coffee is legit, they have oat milk! Make sure to read what's up with the digital numbers on the wall, fun artwork. Sit outside if it's not too chilly right around sunset and the area between the buildings south of the cafe lights up with pinks and oranges.< /Text>

<review>This place could do much better with a little improvement. The coffee selection is decent but they could add more new season flavors. The sandwiches aren't heated, the bread on mine was saggy and didn't taste fresh. Sadly for the price I paid. The brunette barista would do better with a "fresh up" in customer service. I was meeting a friend there and she grumped to us for "blocking the area" (there was no one there) , it felt more like TSA than a cafeteria. You would expect a more warming welcoming at such a charming place like Lacma. Overall we are regular customers and will still visit and order our favorite coffee as usual. But wanted to share this feedback to see if improvement is achieved soon.

<Review>This is a pretty cool coffee place at LACMA. It has the basic coffee options that you'd find at most coffee houses. They also have pastries and a selection of two types of prepackaged sandwiches. The food and coffee was good, but since it's at LACMA, it was definitely overpriced. The staff here are really courteous. This place is great for a quick coffee, latte, or americano during your museum visit.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Really a shame there are so many terrible reviews. After visiting 3 coffee shops this was hands down the best one in walking distance of any of the museums. People who gave this a bad review are those that think the Coffee Bean is gourmet coffee. Don't come of Coffee Bean your benchmark for good coffee.<//Review>

Staff is shockingly oblivious to customers and inept at fulfilling orders correctly and in a timely manner. Don't waste your time, money or energy stopping here. Out of three orders only 2 items were correct and delivered "quickly" and that's because one item was pulled from a self serve basket. Took 15 minutes for a puny vanilla bean shake that was runny, bland and sucked $6.50 from me.< /Review>

<Text>C+M coffee is dark & bitter............................like my callous heart.

Visiting LACMA, mainly for picture taking at Urban Light & Levitated Mass, we needed a late afternoon caffeine boost. Being LACMA's café, convenience trumped cost, as we chose C+M to fulfill our need.

Drip coffee (under $4)-
Man, it's like drinking paint! Bitter, chock full of caffeine, my head began to throb & my tummy started to ache. I actually had a hard time downing this cup of mud. As I've grown older, my tolerance for caffeine has diminished. So, when my the caffeine from my coffee kicked in, I started feeling a little nauseous. For coffee aficionados, this may be your thing, but I'll stick to the less stronger stuff. Especially when considering the cost of a small cup. Jeez!

Hot chocolate (artisanal, under $5)-
A choice of artisanal or Mexican, my brother chose artisanal for he & his wife. Their comments after tasting it were less than exemplary. "Hot water with some chocolate flavor" was the critical analysis. They had to add sugar & half and half to make their small cups palatable. For almost $5, I'd avoid C+M's hot chocolate.

On the bright side, C+M's pastries looked very legit. We saw quite a few customers helping themselves to a sweet treat to go with their coffee. Just needing some caffeine to drink, we opted out of any pastries that evening, despite being asked.

Service was good. The guy working the register was friendly, and our drinks came out in a timely manner. Inside, seating is minimal, with more tables al fresco between exhibit buildings at LACMA.

Sometimes convenience isn't the way to go. I would've much rather gone to a nearby Starbucks, or even better a McDonald's, as their drink choices are more to my liking, not to mention prices. Coffee connoisseurs may get their kicks at C+M, but as for me, I'll pass.< /Text><time>1511547735431<//time>< rating>

(Translated by Google) The coffee and staff were badly received, but the freshly squeezed orange juice, mozzarella sandwiches and chocolate croissants were the best.

(Original)
珈琲とスタッフは酷評ですが、絞りたてのオレンジジュースとモッツァレラサンドイッチ、チョコクロワッサンは最高でした。</text>

<text>They open at 7 AM which is the earliest in the area. They have pretty typical prices and are pretty good about getting people in and out even during busy times. The two things that I could complain about, the owner has zero control over. The business is in the corner of the parking lot in the back from the main street (Hammer) and the ATM machine is always faulty. It seems like the thing should be replaced.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Horrible 😩😩 The cashier made us wait while he had an entire conversation..then took forever to bag our items and raised his voice with an attitude when we asked if he could.. He was moving so slow the guy behind us got irritated as well. Super unprofessional and hostile attitude.< /review>< pictures>

Friendly atmosphere, the employees are great here. Might not be in the ideal neighborhood if you're not into urban areas. It's fine for me though.< /Text>

<review>Great customer service.  Better service than other gun shops in the area.  Other shops treat you like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to purchase from them.  Not these guys.  The owner and staff treat you like a valued customer.  Highly recommend.</review>< Pics>

They helped me with a transfer and my experience was very transparent and easy, also the customer service is very good, shout out to Trisha for the fast email responses and answering all my questions to the best of her ability. I highly Recommend BCFA for your transfer needs.</Review>

<review>As a new firearm owner, I had some trouble finding ammunition due to the whole COVID issue. This place has, hands down, the coolest staff and clientele around. I found ammo, mags, and more. They even made the annoying California background check garbage for ammo painless and quick. I’ll be coming here for all my firearm needs.</review>< gmapID>

Nice mom and pop gun store. Fair prices. Extensive selection on their website and great customer service unlike Highland or Turners. Plus gives the "Teamster Advantage discount for Teamster members. Customer for life..< /text>

People there are very knowledgeable and very nice to everyone whether you're a seasoned gun enthusiast or a Noob. These guys (and gals) make it seem like you have known them awhile. This is my favorite gun shop and I would recommend it to anyone anytime! Can't wait for classes to open up again.</review>

<review>I looked high and low for a .357 mag. Blue Collar had, by far, the best price I could find. Not only do they have amazing prices, they have unmatched customer service, knowledgeable staff, and a great selection of firearms. Also, my favorite thing, they keep the .45 GAP ammo stocked, which is incredibly hard to find. They are now my go-to gun and ammo store. 10/5 stars.
Many thanks.< /review>< GmapID>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I bought a 1911 back around March. I had to wait a bit due to the order being shipped. It was worth the wait to be honest. They are very, very knowledgeable on their guns that they have on sale. I’ve been going to turners for a bit and some of the turners staff is cool .. some just want a sale others are pretty salty if you’re just browsing. These guys at BCF are down to earth they answer your questions without looking down on you. It’s a great place for first time buyers just word your questions right haha.

They do transfers pretty quick and easy. I transferred a lower to a friend of mine at turners we waited about 40 minutes for our number to get called after that we spent about an hour with an employee that didn’t know how to transfer a lower. After that I am not going back. Turners may be a bit cheaper since their a state wide company but I’d rather pay a bit more to a mom and pop shop than wasting hours just to get attended. Blue collar FTW!< /Review>< Pics>

The experience in purchasing this firearm, despite all of the silly hoops that you have to jump through thanks to California, was the most smooth purchase I have ever made. I hope to have the funds to purchase many more firearms here in the future!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I found this place the day after Thanksgiving on my way to the store. I was already in the market for a bipod for my AR, so I decided on stop by. I was immediately greeted and welcomed before I had both feet through the door. I asked to see their bipod selection and was Impressed. I didn't feel like I was being over sold and I was even given suggestions as to which one could be a better choice.
I realized I was going to need a picatinny adapter in order for it to work so man helping me went back there and made sure he didn't come out empty handed. I will definitely be returning to this shop. Amazing customer service.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1484807989389, 'text': 'Thanks for taking the time to write this review, Brian!

<Review>Here's the short version: one of the employees admitted he's not an AR guy and assembled uppers with shoddy parts to sell stating it was a used upper he personally owned so no warranty, and lied saying it as a Rainier arms upper and won't own up to it when a customer has problems... Keep reading for the long version.

They sold my friend an upper a few months ago, 250 rounds in, the bolt broke.. ok... odd... then the gas block fell off.... huh... strange... then the gas key broke off the carrier... My friend and I go to the store trying to get the matter resolved and we talk to the lady behind the counter, She said she doesn't know what's wrong with the upper that it only had 100 rounds through it (I call BS) She said we had to talk to a guy named Chad since it was his personal upper sold used, and he wont show up until 5, (it was around 2:45 pm) So we ask her if she could call him. She says ok, dials on her phone, immediately turns away from us, and then turns back around to tell us it went straight to voicemail.

OK... So My friend and I leave and come back around 5:45pm Chad and one of his buddies is behind the counter, we show him the upper and the bolt carrier, My friend says he doesn't feel confident in the entire rig since it had several catastrophic failures (broken bolt, Gasblock slipping off, Soft carrier, sheared gas key), and would like his money back or to have the store buy the upper back. Chad proceeds to say that there was nothing wrong with the upper, that he only put a hundred rounds through it when he was in Utah, that pistols weren't his thing, so he's selling it. He feels bad for my friend and my friend could buy another BCG from him at cost. I step in and explain that even selling used, that he should try to make things right especially when the gun was having catastrophic failures (bolt broke about 250 rounds in after my friend purchased it) Chad stated there is no warranty when buying a used car, and I stepped in explaining that under CA law there is a warranty requirement for used cars, One of them argued back that we probably abused the upper that we stuck the upper on an 80% and that's why the BCG failed. I explained that an even if it was an 80%, it would not cause failures of that magnitude. That the BCG was made from soft steel, that the contact surface with the hammer should not be getting gouged by the hammer. Chad's friend stated well, he's not a metallurgist and I explained that BCG's are surface hardened to the point where HSS can't cut it that if it wears like that something is seriously wrong with the carrier. Chad's friend then stated He built the rifle that upper came off of. So I sated, well If you built the rifle, how did you make sure the upper was assembled correctly? and then he stated he built the rifle but purchased the upper as a complete assembly. "so you didn't build the rifle then?" "no I built the rifle"... Sigh... ok then you should know better? Chad's friend then stated well, "I'm not an AR guy"... , so if you purchased the complete upper, where did the upper come from? Chad stated he doesn't think any MFG would offer a second hand warranty, that we should just buy a new BCG from them, Eventually, Chad said that Rainier arms made the upper. I replied, that Rainer arms is one of the most highly regarded companies, it sounds odd that they would put out a BCG that would fail that catastrophically, that Rainier arms would sell an upper with none of their markings, They wouldn't budge and my BS meter was off the charts as I was thinking that upper in no way looked like a factory upper much less a Rainier arms upper, since there was tool marks on the handguard and The handguard looked uncharacteristically cheap.... My friend and I leave the store, and then I explain that they were lying,</Review>< pics>

Since in his possession parts were broken, and the upper was brought back to the store damaged. He had the opportunity to  replace the broken parts at cost and refused.\n\nMy apologies we were not able to come to an agreement that was to Brandon's satisfaction.

My experience with this company was not good. I tried to go in here and see some reviews that would have seemed like the issue I was dealing with. But I didn’t see anything. Makes me think things about these reviews. All I’m saying is. My issue was too long to type up. But my experience was completely dissatisfaction and disappointing. I would not hire them. The inspections was something I could have done.< /text>

Have been using f e n n pest control for about 42 years now. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good job done. They even swipe all of the spider webs around the house windows and doors.<//Text>

<Text>Thanks to Bernardo my house is free or termites.  It is so nice to  deal with honest people.  I was so afraid he would tell me I had to have my house tented, but since he found termites in the garage only, he gave me the alternative of treating only the infested places.  He was very thorough and took about 3 hours to take care of my termite problem.

Sincerely

Fidel was fantastic to work with! He informed me of what they were doing, the status of the situation, and how they were treating it. Fidel was very present, grounded, and down to earth; highly appreciated him and the job those with him did!</review>

I tried to go in here and see some reviews that would have seemed like the issue I was dealing with. But I didn’t see anything. Makes me think things about these reviews. All I’m saying is. My issue was too long to type up. But my experience was completely dissatisfaction and disappointing. I would not hire them. The inspections was something I could have done.</text>< pics>

Have been using f e n n pest control for about 42 years now. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good job done. They even swipe all of the spider webs around the house windows and doors.< /text>

I was so afraid he would tell me I had to have my house tented, but since he found termites in the garage only, he gave me the alternative of treating only the infested places.  He was very thorough and took about 3 hours to take care of my termite problem.

< review>
I passed by once and noticed the extra large lawn chairs and as a person who enjoys art and maintains appreciation for creativity and nature alike, i have told several friends and family members about the huge lawn chairs. These chairs got bigger and bigger each time i told another person until they were 100 feet tall. (They’re not that big) lol but for the first time I took a walk in the park with a good friend who I hadn’t seen in a while. We enjoyed a sunny day at the park, took many photos and I have an amazing experience admiring the art and various birds in the park.  This park is near police station, fire station, school and library. I would consider this a safe location for anyone who doesn’t intend to break the law. Lol add me on IG I wanna get my follows up<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is a pleasant park, it has free parking, and a library, the park is not very big, it has a lake with several species of birds, they have chairs to share with family or friends, there is no nearby trade so come prepared, there is no playground area so it is not recommended for children to entertain themselves.

Es un parque agradable,  tiene parqueadero gratuito, y una biblioteca,  el parque no es muy grande, tiene un lago con varias especies de aves, tienen sillas para compartir en familia o con amigos, no hay comercio cercano asi que ven preparado,  no hay zona de parque infantil así que no es recomendable para que los niños se entretengan.<//Text>< Pictures>

Delicious as always. I did squeeze hot chilli juice in my eye and that sucked. Still worth the meal though.</Text>

In n out is one of my fave fast food burgers, however, I always go to the one in Pleasanton. It was only until yesterday I went to this one and I sadly experienced not one, but two strands of long hair in my burger! I was really hungry last night and I wasn’t able to enjoy my dinner because of this. So please be careful in the back. The fries weren’t that bad tho.< /Text>

I had to place a big order and they were very helpful and clarified with me multiple times to make sure my order was correct. Conner was very helpful and I appreciated them helping me carry everything to my car as well. Food is delicious and their customer service went above and beyond for me.</Review>

Some of my favorite french fries, which can be made even better by adding melted cheese or having them made "Animal Style". A wonderful selection of soft drinks and classic tasting milkshakes, In-N-Out makes shame of the old fashioned rule that things cant be quick, cheap, and good tasting all at the same time. For Californians and people who have frequented the West Coast, this should feel nostalgic. For anyone who hasn't had the chance to taste it, In-N-Out will undoubtedly remain the one of the highlights of their trip to the Bay Area.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGd1X5ZVxnGL49uBDaVmJeDDt_lwX7Ey5lk6Ul=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQbH6r5gM9xUEZXLnIHvRT3eowwfPS5GHQIEAM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMU2vNxgYDcmT72YUNxRguBuOe03LJ0cQuoJ8PX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSkRnI46lhB9XorxJ_GgYJiHwm4EHuYFed78Si=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>We waited over 20 minutes for our order, even though the line at the cashier wasn't long before us, just one or two customers.

When we got our food, it was already cool and not hot at all.

They didn't offer ketchup and were very slow to refill our drinks.

Food itself was normal, hence the 3 stars.

Overall a subpar In-N-Out experience. We'll try to avoid it next time we're in the area.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

< Review>
This is definitely one of the better in-n-out out there!! Compared to other locations I’ve been to, the burgers here are all fresh and supppper delicious! The fries were not too dry and the burgers were pretty juicy. Everything about this location was fantastic! I bet you’ll also enjoy eating here as well.

They’re also hiring right now. Starting from $17.00 to $19.50< /Review>

Normally I am pretty happy with In-N-Out Burger. But this time, at the Livermore store, the hamburger was overcooked.  The employees are normally great. This time, the drive-through cashier was not of their caliber.< /text>

A tremendous nightmare starting with the parking and lack of empathy for covid-19. This particular location does not care about covid-19 cases or if you get sick or not. With a rush to open their doors so quickly, it's no wonder people are flocking to this place like the plague. I've seen people go in (only once & final time) without a mask and come out coughing and panting. If that's the case, they might as well let the whole city of Tracy in and avoid the rules altogether, making it impossible for you to get into the hospital if you need to. Although they have signs on the doors, people are still being let in maskless, crowded lines and less cleaning. The parking lot intrudes on the smaller businesses around it, meaning you can't park anywhere to get to those small shops, you have to park across the street. It was also closed briefly during the pandemic to sanitize the entire store in which didn't help but only for a few days. But like all places, if someone has tested positive for covid-19, that person may or may not wish to disclose that information with the company, in great fear of losing their job. Not much they can do about it, but if you're worried about contracting the virus, you may want to opt out of fast food for awhile and this place is no exception. The lines are ridiculously long and the customers are impatient, rude and negligent. Good luck waiting an hour in the drive thru. No thanks.<//Text>

<Text>The fries here are different and delicious. The employees were friendly, cheerful, and looked like they enjoy working here. I ordered a hamburger with nothing on it except extra pickles and they put just the right amount of pickles. The place was very busy with an almost full parking lot and a long drive thru line but we did not have to wait long for our food. Even in such a busy time, the restaurant was clean.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKsDo1MeT9lo3lXqupFvEGm2UQVUo6CDwPn--B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Fast service, bit of wait during rush hour, burgers looked and tasted great. Friendly employees. Everything was overall a great experience that I have come to expect when visiting any In n Out. Drive thru only at the moment only because of social distancing but the wait wasn't too bad.<//Text>< time>

<Review>I honestly can't tell what the hype if all about. Yes, the service is great, everyone smiles, the food comes out on time and overall it's just a solid experience. But, the food is just average fast food type. I prefer shake shack and five guys over this in-n-out burger and the fries were disappointing. I like crispy fries and these were not that. A decent late night snack option, but I wouldn't go out of my way.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp>< name>

<user_name>Sue Whitacre<//user_name><Text>I moved to Central OR from CA 15 years ago. Today I was in Livermore CA visiting a relative. One of the first things I did was Google In-N-Out Burger. Nothing compares to it! It's in a class of its own from the personnel staff to the hand cut fries. Top of the line. My meal was fabulous-double double cheeseburger and fries. I wish this franchise would come to Central OR! But for now, just nostalgia.<//Text><userid>104742683815389506959<//userid>< response>

I had a custom order and Nalini did a great job! What moved me to make this review was the following. I was happy already when withi received my order, as I was grabbing some condiments, Kelsey stopped me and said to return my fries 🍟. She was not satisfied with the quality of that batch I was given. She grabbed them and gave me a new batch. This act reminded me of Chef Ramsey doing a quality control. I was very happy and felt great. Thank you guys.</text>< pics>

4th time in 6+ days, super consistent, why does fountain Coke taste so good from all In N Out locations? Maybe they just follow instructions, who knows, hot chilis, just like every OG burger stand in LA used to have.</Review>

<review>Good place for burgers, fries and shakes. I really don't care for the thousand island dressing or whatever that sauce is they put on burgers but leave that stuff out and you have a better tasting burger. Tip. Keep the dining room clean.

Finally not a huge line of people anymore. Lots of parking in plaza. Easy access from Rt580. Can accommodate RVs. Unlimited fountain drinks with real Coke products. Paper towels are set outside of cashier. Outdoor seating available. Drive through have lines typically. Restroom available. Service is quick relative to othe In n Out.</Review>

Quick, friendly service with a smile. Burger was great (do it Animal Style!). Fries could be better. Chocolate shake was very light, tasted ok but could use more chocolate.</Text>

Best service in town. Rarely do the make a mistake and the only time they did, they were so good about it. They also have no problem making a keto compatible burger. I can't remember what the burger is called, but they'll know.< /Review>

Super busy with loud, rowdy high schoolers when we went on a recent Friday night around 11pm. Many tables not cleaned due to crowds. Veggie burger & fries were good as always. Counter staff is very attentive & helpful.< /text>

The protein style double double is pretty much the best gluten free burger option I've come across at a drive-thru - nice crisp lettuce in place of the bun but held together well and tasted amazing. Great friendly service as always, plus the shakes are delicious!</text>

Ever since this place has opened up (it's been around for a decade) it has given exceptional service. Its fast food the doesn't disappoint but for once the service and people don't either.</Text>

Delicious food as always. The oddest part was the incredibly long wait in the drive thru, especially as it was only 11:15 am and not on a weekend. Second oddest was that the "dine-in" tray they served the two of us had about 2/3rds the fries in one fry container and 1/3 in the other. The size discrepancy was shocking.</Text>

The king of fast food burgers, period! I quantify fast food as something you don't have to exit your vehicle for. Are there better burgers to be had? Yes, but there is nothing that compares for the price and availability. Oh yeah BTW, the burgers are off the hook no matter what.</Text>

Oh How I Miss You In-N-Out. On my recent trip back to California I made sure that one of my first stops as soon as the plane landed was to visit my long lost animal style fries. They taste as great as I remember. The service was great.  I hear that we might be getting a location here in Denver.  Hope spings eternal!< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>What more is there to say about this California institution? Probably one of the best burgers you can get on the West coast. Always consistent always fresh and always good tasting. I usually go for a protein style Double-Double hamburger.the only not I have is at this place always has constantly long lines either inside the store or outside in the drive through. But hey, that is the price you pay for a great-tasting, affordable, and classic hamburger.<//Text><UserId.>102338226077530057723<//UserId.>< Time>

I love in an out, so good. Always fast friendly and clean. Best place for a fast food Burger. You can order it however you like raw onions cooked onions more meat extra cheese I also like that the french fries are cooked fresh they don't have a cheap fast food taste. Every time I try a new place that is supposed to be better than in and out I disagree</text>

We frequent this In N Out a lot... The staff are always super kind and attentive to customized orders. The food is always great but if there's something you dont like, they make it again for you. The dining room and restrooms are well kept and stocked everytime we've gone. During peak hours, they can handle the rush and still are just as attentive to the specific customer. A++ service, attitude, and facilities.<//Text>

In n out is always delicious and always fast even when they're busy. We ordered 2 animals fries and some burgers and they were sooooo good. Animal fries always take longer but they had our order out super fast. Will definitely go to this location again. Especially since I work down the street.</Text>

Stopped by for a quick bite to eat with a friend. We were in the mood for fries so we decided to head inside instead of the drive through line thinking it would be quicker. It was around 2:30pm and we waited 15 minutes for 2 orders of french fries only.  Overall was disappointed in the wait time, but enjoyed my food. I would probably recommend to go thru the drive thru window at this location. It's really packed on the inside every time I go and the drive thru line seems to move quicker.</Text>

I've been to quite a few In-N-Outs and this one was particularly good. It's easy and right off the highway. Plus the staff was super friendly. It was almost table service. One worker came and picked up our trays without us even asking. Highly recommend<//Text>

<Text>The best fast food burgers.
If the burger is the bit you care most about, go here.
They have some weird management practices, like the bible verse citations on the bottoms of the cups and trays, but it is mostly fine. The verse cited on the milkshake cups is anathemic to all intellectualism though; maybe don't buy a milkshake.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I gotta say I've never seen a friendlier fast food place. The cashier, Michelle, helped a customer in front of me change their order way after they ordered and make sure they were satisfied. Was very friendly while taking my order. Then I saw a lady ask for a bag and what was both funny and very customer service, she was asked if she needed help by 3 to 4 employees in about 30 seconds. Food was good as usual. My only gripe is that my animal fries were put in the steamer about 5 times and were soggy. Not crispy like normal.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Hard to say much about an In-N-Out. I find them much more consistent than any other burger chain. This one is typical. The burgers and everything else is prepared exactly as a customer would expect. Dinner was delicious and quickly served. If you like In-N-Out, you will like this one. If you like a well made basic burger, you will like this one. If you want a fancy, gourmet burger, this may nonot be what you want.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< rate>

In n out and Habit Burger are the two best fast-food burgers available anywhere.  When ordering at in and out, ask for your burger "animal style." It has extra sauce sauteed onions and other goodies. Ask for your fries to be "extra crispy."<//text>

They use fresh cut potatoes for your French fries and all fresh food for your burgers!
Hint: when you go to order, look up their secret menu online....
I always order a....
DOUBLE DOUBLE ANIMAL STYLE!
What's your favorite?<//Text>< Pictures>

Great food and very fast service! My wife and I stopped in Pleasanton's In N' Out and left due to the excessive line, and parking lot traffic.

Lo' N' Behold 7 miles away lies this golden opportunity for the restaurant. Food fast fast, line was short and faster, and food is how you would expect from this organization.

We also learned that In N Out can cut the burger in quarters for our Toddler, which we greatly appreciated!</text>

Who can't say no to in n out. The juicy patties with melting cheese on top along with a animal fries and a cold coke.  Love in n out. It's a must have at least once a month. Once I had in n out 20 times in a month and still tasted good each time. The drive thru here can get long during lunch and dinner but they send someone out to take the orders for a fast service. The shakes aren't bad. I like the strawberry shake. Soon I have to try a 4x4 cheeseburger. But I'm saving it for when I'm starving and craving in n out. So pretty soon..< /Text>

I like this place. Don't let the long line fool you.  They move fast and the food is hot. Double double with a shake. Ask for your fries light well for an extra crisp!< /text>

This In-N-Out-burger location is always busy with drive trough, I love the burger 🍔 and fries 🍟. I mostly use the drive trough service. My only problem is the wait time, it’s mostly a long line but other than that everything is perfect 👌< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>This is the best in-n-out I have ever come across. The burgers were well seasoned. Fries were crispy and actually salted. They got the order correct. I didn't have to repeat myself. If I am ever up here again, I will definitely come back here.  live in southern California and they always mess up on my order and give raw meat and soggy fries.

This particular location is great and worth a review. Most In N Out's can be chaotic and difficult to deal with. This one is busy too but they are very efficient and keep the place clean. I rarely have a hard time getting a table. And the food is delicious as usual. Great staff, well ran.< /Text>

Same great quality food each and every time that I go and eat at this restaurant. Quality, freshness, and cleanliness are the names of their games.< /text>

<Review>I hadn't eaten here in years. It didn't taste the way I remembered. I don't eat fast food very often so the problem may be with me.

The service was excellent as usual.</Review>< gmap_id>

I thought In And Out was still the best after 8 years, but my most recent trip here in December made me sad. My order took about 20 minutes during a lunch rush and it was only 2 burgers with fries. What I hoped to be superb in every way turned ended up where the buns were burnt and the fries devoid of salt or oil. I honestly believe I would have a better time at wendys close by.< /text>

Wait wasn't very long and all the employees seemed really nice. There was one guy that smiled the ENTIRE time I was there. Literally every time I looked at him he was smiling as he walked around cleaning and giving people their food. He's pretty cool and seemed incredibly nice. He threw away our trash for us too.< /review>

<Time>1513044019693</Time><Review>This food chain is highly overrated. There are no options, there is always a wait. This chain features food that is fresh to death, but thats all. Fresh isn’t always enough to be tasty. The fries could really use a tastier oil and the burgers need some seasoning. A good side sauce could do the small menu some justice.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><gmap_id>0x808fe7ace7d15f17:0xe6db0a27818c9505<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>Todays dine-in experience just somehow was even more pleasant then my drive thru one a couple of days ago -
Best part of both visits =
During peak weekday lunch hours, employees were calm & collective without making you feel rushed unlike certain other so called burger joints within that surrounding area with in the same daily timeframe.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Had a tight schedule Monday morning around 11am, but wanted my children from Chicago who had already eaten to have a taste of what was suppose to be In-N-Out.
Order 2 fries, 2 milkshakes and one plain cheese burger. After watching the drive in be served for about 12 minutes I asked how long it should take for 2 fries, 2 milkshakes and 1 cheeseburger. After another 5 minutes we finally got our to go order 18 minutes later.
For any walkins expect a In-N-Wait experience.
Don't really need to go back when you've got Val's Burgers as an option...

I thought in n out motto was “quality you can taste” except where’s the quality at? The past couple of months my food has been burnt and fries aren’t cooked all the way. The woman working at the window giving the food is so rude and disrespectful, she completely ignored me while she was standing right in front of me, thank god some other woman behind her took it upon herself to do the other woman’s job.

I think this place needs some new employees because obviously this location is going downhill with the attitude of the employees and employees just not cooking the food properly. I’d recommend to just drive down to the Pleasanton location.< /Text>

Even with a long line of people, they hustle there and the wait is never more than 5-10 minutes. The food is always good.</text>

Very good service. Food is always tasty here. The restaurant itself is loud, a little messy and rather uncomfortable. Not a Dine-In experience Otherwise a great place<//Text>

I don't understand why California people are obsessed with In N Out saying it is the best burger place in the state. I have tried it twice and the burger is not terrible, but nothing special. If anything, it is a bit too greasy for me. Not even any plastic forks were provided. The fries are really bad though, not even warm and no taste to them, barely even yellow when they should be golden. And the menu is so limited, in the USA it seems crazy that there is such a place with basically nothing except fries and beefburgers to eat, not even chicken burgers or bacon burgers.<//Review>

Half our drive time was spent just getting to Livermore from the South Bay. Luckily we all had a craving for burgers and this is right off the freeway. I was hoping to wait for the Tracy one but we were just going too slow. Lucky to because when we drove by the Tracy one the car line was into the street and the parking lot was packed.
I tried out a double double animal style with green chilies off the not so secret menu and it was good but still not enough chilies. I didn't want to risk getting them chili cheese fries on a long road trip. Will have to save that adventure for a closer potty.< /Review>< Pics>

I tried 2 times in n out burgers. And both times were disgusting. Not going there anymore once. The fries are 100% blend, they taste like flour and the burger steak+ bun have a very cheap taste. I guess I could have expected it.</Review>

Food was cold when we got it.  Waited 30 minutes to get it and had to ask why they took 5 orders in front of ours. They made my 86 year old father wait needlessly. We won't go back there.<//Text>

One of my stops every time I go home to California.< /Review>< gmapID>

The food is great. The price is better any other fast food. The food is also healthier.< /Text>

You can never go wrong with In-N-Out Burger. The staff is always pleasant and my order is always right.  The wait may be a little long at time but it's In-N-Out so it's worth it.</Review>

Loves it. I would recommend a milkshake . they are very delicious. Very popular.Drive thru is very full most of the time I go there. The fries there are very fresh. I would recomend a using a milkshake as a dip for frys. That is a very good combination.</review>

Quick, accurate, friendly service just as I have seen at every other In-N-Out.  The place was clean and well stocked. The parking lot is sizeable which is nice considering how busy this place seems to be so parking was easy.<//review>

This store was very crowded when we were there. That being said, they did a nice job getting our food quickly. It was loud at the outside tables due to freeway noise. Had my standard Gluten Free Flying Dutchman with fries, with an iced tea. I think the total was about $6.00 for my meal.< /review>

They have a hidden menu and if you know how to order you will have a great experience. Never found one of these stores dirty or without a very friendly helpful staff.< /review>< date>

< Review>
i think only californian natives like these place. the french fries are not good at all and the burger is decent but the line is so so so long and why do they make the workers wear those weird clothes? also when i come with my friends (which i have a lot of) we don’t fit at one table but the tables and chairs are attached to the ground so we have to sit separate. wow</Review>

Went there one night and saw a huge rats cross the drive thru lane on multiple locations. Very gross!

However, the food was good. Just didn't like seeing all the rats when trying to eat a hamburger.< /Text>

What else can I say, it's In-N-Out Burger! If you are visiting CA this is a must do -- This particular location is very typical of In-N-Outs, the food is consistent, the staff is friendly, and the wait can be long (especially drive thru).  I recommend the double-double with grilled onions (always order the grilled onions with any In-N-Out burger).<//text>

Usually a long line in the drive through during lunch and dinner rush, but they move you through daily quickly. They're very friendly and have never messed up an order for me.</Text>

Fries are not great, but burgers/shakes are alright. Haven't been here in a couple years, but it's not as great as I thought it'd be.</Text>

Very good food, service is exceptional, even though the line at the drive-thru appeared to be very long. I still got in and out within a few minutes.< /Text>

double burger, fries, and shake for less than $10 how do you go wrong. Not a big fan of the fries though, they cook them a lil too long, theyre basically potato chips. 4 stars nonetheless</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) A decent hamburger at an inexpensive price. Because it is a famous chain, it is worth visiting. But if you need to find a restaurant because it is close to a good fast food restaurant, it is not too bad to look for other alternatives. Patty likes to add.

(Original)
비싸지 않은 가격에 괜찮은 맛의 햄버거. 원체 유명한 체인이라 한 번 가볼만은 한데 가성비 좋은 패스트푸드점에 가까워서 맛집을 찾아야겠다면 꼭 여기 말고 다른 대안을 찾아보는 것도 나쁘진 않음. 패티는 추가하는 게 좋아요.< /text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The hamburger was double wrapped and only half inside (feeling like a crescent) was tight, so it was hard to break down to the end and it was easy to eat. Lettuce, tomato and onion were fresh and delicious. Potato is delicious in McDonald's in Japan.

(Original)
ハンバーガーは二重に包んであって、内側は半分だけ（三日月のような感じ）きつめにつつんであるので、最後まで崩れにくくて食べやすかったです。レタス、トマト、玉ねぎは新鮮で美味しかったです。ポテトは日本のマクドナルドの方が美味しいかな。</Text>

The clerk is bright and friendly and the work is fast.
Hamburgers are devised to make it easier to eat, and the taste is also good!
French fries are crisp and tasty even when time goes on. Salt is a separate attachment so you can adjust the taste yourself.
Ice tea was impressive that cut lemon was put. Everything is Good.

(Original)
チェーン店と思えないおいしさ！
店員さんは明るくて愛想がよくて、仕事が早い。
ハンバーガーは食べやすいように工夫されており、味もGood！
フレンチフライはカリッとしていて時間が立ってもおいしいです。塩は別添えなので自分で味の調整ができますよ。
アイスティーはカットレモンが置いてあるのが印象的でした。すべてがGoodです。</Review>< GmapID>

<text>(Translated by Google) Always a good option to take away. Attentive, at a good price, they take sometimes, but it's worth it.
