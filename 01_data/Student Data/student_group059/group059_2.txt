It was my first time at West Dermatology, and the whole experience was very positive. Also, I didn't have to wait long at all. Everybody was friendly, the waiting room felt warm and bright. Gary was also very nice and thorough. I felt like I was in good hands. Thank you!< /Text>

Gary is very thorough and cautious and I always feel confident that he's making the right decisions. He is very gentle and doesn't cause me undue pain. He is available in a timely manner and I'm able to make an appointment with him within a few days of my call. Very appreciated when I'm concerned about a suspicious spot.</Text>

I have been seeing Gary Vanesky for I think about 10 years. He is the best at what he does both in his ability and knowledge and as important his bed side manner. He always takes time to answer my questions and calm any concerns that I have. I feel truly cared for as a person not just another patient.  I refer family, friends and clients and everyone feels the same. The staff are also wonderful and always take care of my needs. I would give 10 stars if I could!</Text>

<review>Gary is amazing!! I previously had a horrible experience with a different doctor from a different office. I was hastily "diagnosed", given no reason for the prescriptions she had prescribed, nor did she answer my questions or take into account my concerns. However, after seeing Gary I was so beyond HAPPY and excited to get started on the treatment plan. He prescribed medication that would allow me to continue my life (enjoying the sun) without harsh effects on my skin. He genuinely seemed concerned with all of my questions and thoroughly explained the whole process and what to expect. He did everything I had hoped for and I cannot wait to see the results!!! Thank you so much!<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Gary is wonderful and thorough.  Something you do not find with all dermatology practices.  Since we have a strong family history of skin cancer I appreciated the time he spent on my appointment.<//review>

Gary was excellent and so was all the staff.  The only negative thing was that I took the time to register on line prior to the appointment and they said it didn't come through, even though I got a message thanking me for registering.  I started to fill out the paperwork by hand and then one of the receptionists discovered that my registration had come thorough after all.</text>

I was on the East Coast and had a Shingles outbreak and I had my Valcyclovir tablets with me. My daughter is a doctor and had me take the correct dosage to treat my Shingles. She wanted me to see a dermatologist when I returned home to Carlsbad because I was still  having pain and itching after the blisters healed.< /review>

<review>Dr Vanetzky and Staff were fabulous. Would recommend them to anyone. Dr V is easy to communicate with and does the perfect job of both listening to, and educating, his patients while addressing their concerns promptly. He spends as much time as the patient needs. The doctor is a gem in his field, but never brusque or dismissive. His staff is friendly, attentive and helpful; all rarities in today’s medical environment. A real find!   As an avid kayaker an outdoors woman, I spend a good amount of time in the sun.  Dr V also sent me home with a variety of samples of good quality sunblock so I  could sample which product worked best for me, and knew how to remain preventative of skin cancer as I age.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Text>Dr. Vanetsky is amazing and was very attentive towards my aggressive cystic acne.  He actually took the time to inject every pimple and comped the cortisone for first visit as it was not covered for a first visit under my insurance..  overall, compared to other dermatologists that I’ve seen in the past, Dr Vanetsky is empathetic and actually cares for his patients vs running it as a mill of getting people in and out as quickly as possible and only focusing on the business end of things.  Thank Dr. Vanetsky for taking good care of me!<//Text>< Pics>

Gary Vanetsky is very compassionate, understanding and friendly.  The rest of the staff I have come in contact with have been aloof, sometimes seems like I'm an inconvenience.  They never smile and never make me feel welcome. I really hate walking in the office because I feel uncomfortable there.  We're it not for Gary's attentiveness, I would have stopped going a long time ago.<//Review>

<Time>1513122424360</Time><Rating>5</Rating><Review>Under Vanetsky Gary’s care your in good hands! I had got bitten not sure if it was a spider or what. This was recent and I went to urgent care after the side of my foot was swelling I ended up receiving steroids so as to make sure I don’t get cellulitis or it spreading to my blood, I also received antibiotics. This only worked so much I stil had burning blisters like bumps that would keep coming and spreading to my other toes. I went to the er again for them to tell me they can’t help they don’t know what it is and gave me a foot doctor I was so depressed because it was becoming painful and unsightly. I reached out to other places but no help. My Mom mom took me here I am so grateful! Dr. Vanetsky is so sweet and actually listens! Him and his nurse took note and knew a lot about my medical history and multiple sclerosis too. They mentioned integrative ways, healthy lifestyle that show positive results with ms. It just shows they care. I appreciate that so much. The nurse even became emotional after finding how young I am to have it and connected that her loved one also was affected. I felt so much better leaving and will be a long time patient. My foot recovered in 3-4 weeks finally got help and resolution.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My doctor is so friendly and detailed about the information he is providing during my visits at the facility. The staff are so friendly and helpful in all aspect of my needs. If ever I would get a work related injury or medical visits, I would go back to their facility. Good job and keep it up!< /Review>< pictures>

I had my initial visit with Physical Therapy. It was a very positive experience. Everyone was friendly and professional. I was very happy with the one on one experience. My therapist put together a strategy that will help me rehab my injuries. I have hope that I'll make a complete recovery!<//Review>

The staff was kind, professional and very helpful. They were even accommodating to patients that needed extra attention while I was there. I was there to see Dr. Katz and was so thankful that he was kind, professional and a good listener 😃 It was my first time there and hope all my experiences will be like this. Also, Had X-rays done by Martin that was Very kind, professional and patient. Thank you again for the good experience.</Review>

For the purpose of what I have been sent to them for. They have exceeded my expectations, and are quite friendly and helpful. Like any clinic that's open you do need to follow protocol, which includes a wait time.<//Review>

Dr. Blake Berman is very thorough and takes the time to listen. He explains everything in depth and shows MRI films and explains them in layman’s terms. He is very professional and respectful. I highly recommend him for back issues.<//Text>

The staff at Healthpointe Ontario are all great. However, the wait to see the doctor is ridiculously long. It shouldn't take 2 hours from check-in to exam room, then you still have to wait for the doctor. 🤔🤔</review>

My appointments are always at 2:30 pm and I still have to wait an hour and a half it’s ridiculous. Only one time, a fluke,  I waited a half hour. Today I had my 2 granddaughters and gave them a heads up and asked if I was going to have to wait 1 1/2 hrs like last time. Not sure what she babbled about but it’s very unprofessional and I had to walk out as my back was killing me from sitting and standing so long. Never again will I allow a two-bit clinic to waste my time like that again.<//Review>< Pics>

Front counter girls are so very helpful and friendly, they will assist you with a smile. And then you have Dianna, she is the greatest, she does the work of three girls, she is always busy, but she will always take the time to say hi how you doing, how do you feel, and she will take time out of her busy day to help you, with a smile. She's great.< /text>

<Name>Joy__Division_is_cool</Name><text>Fairly poor especially from doctor mcmurrary. I came in after a fall at work with migraine nausea and vertigo. He diagnosed me as migraine. Saw him for a solid two minutes. It wasn’t until I saw doctor Anthony that realized I had fluid in my ear and possible broken bones. He was good. He immediately set out for me to see an ent. But mcmurray would ask what’s wrong and I’d ask when will I see this ent. He didn’t know what I was talking about even though as this point we’ve been discussing it for two weeks. My final diagnosis by the ent was ear infection eustation tube blockage and hearing loss which caused my concussion like symptoms. Mcmurray put ringing in ear as my diagnosis in my official insurance claim papers. NEVER EVER said that I ringing in my ears. He kept asking how work was even though he sent me back notes saying I couldn’t work. He needs to retire because this is pure medical negligence.< /text>< Time>

Overall, the staff are friendly.Lots of paperwork to fill out when you are a new patient. For my first time there I didn’t have many complaints except for the feeling of being rushed to clear a room for the next person. I will follow up after my next visit.
Second time around the day appeared to be double booked. I was waiting an hour after my appointment time, but wasn't the only one. The staff is courteous and work to get you what you need. The doctor I was seen by was very helpful and friendly. So far, my experience with this medical office is good.< /text>

This doctors office is pretty good. Text and phone reminders for appointments. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They follow Covid protocol correctly, so you feel safe. Since changing doctors, I have had to wait a little on a few occasions, but she is a great doctor, always answers any questions and doesn’t make you feel rushed.</Text>

Healthpointe has always had impeccable service. The reminder phone calls for appointments, ease of scheduling appointments, and the service provided during my office visits have been stellar, five star service. Now that my time with them has come to an end, I would like to recommend their services to potential patients by proving my review. I wish that my PCP offered the same excellent services!<//Review>

<text>The staff is great, but my concern is why does everything from chairs to tables to equipment look so bad? They need to be replaced for the patients..torn or worn out seats in waiting rooms and definitely in the physical therapy area... Safety for the patients is definitely a concern...old stuff support your clinics</text></record>

When changing an appointment due to bad weather/ travel, the Rep checked all calendars although it took time - he finally re-scheduled an appointment. And for that I appreciate the time he took on my behalf.
Refreshing to see that kind of commitment and compassion.</review>

<text>Great Dr! Very knowledgeable, kind and caring, and his staff are really helpful too and make you feel comfortable. You feel like a person rather than a number here and wait times are not bad at all.

Well where to start...
Look can be deceiving it very clean & well keep inside. the lobby is a good size. plenty of room for people to set there!
If your employer make you take a drug test Healthpointe is a nice & welcoming place. Especially the staff they are very polite & not rude at all! (Unlike US Health Works the staff over there are very rude!) But Healthpointe very friendly & polite! I highly recommend this place if your employer sends you here or for any other needs!</review>

< review>
I’m writing regarding my Physical Therapy experience.  I have been doing PT off and on for the past two years for a neck and shoulder injury.  I just started therapy last week at Healthpointe.  I am extremely excited and completely overjoyed because in just two sessions thus far,  I have better results.  The therapists are very attentive with providing one on one individual therapy.  They are very encouraging and supportive and explain in detail how to do each excercise and the rationale.  They truly focus on my areas of pain and immediately work to provide relief or more comfort even during an exercise.  For the first time in two years, I truly feel that I am on an excellent path to recovery because I am working with Therapists who CARE and are competent in their delivery and guidance with treatment.  I actually look forward to each session!  Thank you Healthpointe Therapists!<//review>

One of the worst clinic I've been to , the staff in charge of the front desk are very unprofessional!!! They ask you if you have any questions even though they never have an answer. We waited to be seen four hours in the heat with no a/c. Only to wait another hour in a room for the dr. Very disappointing how some people think they own the place just 'cause they work there.< /Review>

If the TV were to be on it should be appropriate for kids as well.... Volume to loud... Almost left the appointment.
Doctors & staff great!
Now a different day. I showed up 40 minutes early and they are 1 hour late.  In my last year and a half of appointments, this establishment is not good with being on time.</review>

I spoke with them for a very short amount of time  which was spent answering 1 or 2 questions.  I didn’t have enough time one on one too get into any of the issues I’ve been having. Nobody had considered  whether I should be taking my cast off or not until I asked the woman setting up my next appointments at which point I had to wait longer do you see the physician again who is currently with another patient only to find out they can’t remove it I have to go to another location two weeks later.< /review><GmapID>0x80c333c3b48582dd:0xddb5b2107fc4d057< /GmapID><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

I was very impressed w/ this clinic. The staff was awesome...especially the X-ray Technician Armando & the young men that assisted him!! I spent 5 hrs there because it was my initial visit and Dr Katz gave me the option of having the xrays done then rather than return for another appt. An option for which I was very grateful!! I was led, literally by hand, from one room to the next & was offered those cute (ha ha) blue “clown” shorts & booties for my feet that were freezing cold. I would happily recommend Healthpointe to everyone!! Thank you 😊 so much for your tender, loving care!!</Text>

I lost work time, lost an appointment with a client that was scheduled to happen at this moment and have yet to be seen. The Office wass scheduled to close an hour ago but the wait room still holds 15 people... everyone complained about their 2+ hr wait. Been to other Healthpoint offices but this one has the worst. Id compare this to my last DMV visit buy at least DMV sticks to their scheduled appointments.< /Text>< Pictures>

I wrote a positive review on Dr Etemad a while back. This is an update on this doctor. I’ve been under his care for months now. On my last visit, We were told by him, that he will be sending me out to see another provider. He hasn’t done anything for me and insurance hasn’t approved my MRI. He stated, he does surgery and cuts. And the other doctor can give me different meds that will work for me. He only knows a few and will see me an a year. Prior to making his decision to referring me out to another doctor. He asked me if I wanted surgery. When I responded, we noticed he wasn’t happy with my response and that’s when he decided to send me out and discharge me. My fam and I were a bit confused because he wasn’t making any sense. We tried to ask for more info but doctor doesn’t give you the opportunity to ask any questions because he’s always walking out the room and ignoring you. He doesn’t care when you want clarification and only spends less then 10 mins on each visit. In the past, We noticed that he lies on his reports to what he tells his patients. I am in the medical field too, so, I document every detail when I leave so I could remember our conversation. Basically, to sum it up! I’ve been seeing him for months and he basically discharged me to another pain management doctor. Doctor Etemad, original plan of care with me was to give me epidural injections, repeat in two months, then again in another two months if it doesn’t work then I would need surgery. This came out of his month and this was his recommendation. It’s not my fault the MRI hasn’t been approved and the insurance denied the injection because they requested a MRI first! He should of given it more time because a week later, my MRI was scheduled. From the result of his decision, I just found out. The insurance cut off my monthly income. Now, I have no ability to pay my rent and other financial obligations. I am very stressed out and depressed Because I most likely will be evicted. Because of his decision to discharge me, It put me in a very difficult situation financially. The only positive thing is, I was finally seen by the provider he referred me to at another Healthpoint facility. The new doctor was confused and couldn’t believe he discharged me without doing anything for me. You can tell he was in shock and couldn’t understand why he would discharge me because he hasn’t done any treatment on me. Thank god this new doctor was very understanding and good bed side manners. He will be doing my injections. And he said, when I need surgery. He will send me out to have the surgery with another provider because he doesn’t do surgery. He was a great doctor and the entire staff were awesome!  A huge difference to Healthpointe in Ontario!! As for management at the Ontario facility, your administration dept should seriously read all the negative reviews that has been written about Dr Etemad on other review sites. I read them when I first begin seeing him but gave him the benefit of the doubt. Now, I know what ppl have said about him on these reviews are correct! Please re-evaluate your doctor and send him to classes how to interact with his patients and not treat them like if they’re just a number and to not do falsification on his reports. I work for a well known medical facility for the last 18 years and they take things like this serious.There priority is patient care. It’s a shame that you can tell he’s here just to receive his paycheck and has no compassion for his patients or bed side manners.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Good staff
For the moment I was well worked ... I hope and continue like this.
I recommend it, especially with Dr.Alupay, Pedro. He is my doctor who specializes in hand and arm pain, with too much experience. Take your time to listen and the time you need to explain your incident. They also have translators so that the understanding between the two is possible.
5 ☆☆☆☆☆ and if you could up to 10 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ it would put you.
Oh, and they have clinics in different places, and they look for the clinic closest to your home. Just ask and they will kindly provide you with the closest ati.
I am grabbing wing that is located in Ontario, down Mountain Avenue.
Their medical staff, they all do their best so that patients feel safe to be there, if they sometimes take a long time to be treated, but they are always looked after by someone, they may make one or the other exception but the complaint is always respected oh no displeasure, just have to have peace of mind when he expresses his bad treatment, and with all kindness apologize the manager of the place and take action on the matter. Obviously, your appointment will be resumed with another Dr-oh specialist, different from the one who attended you. I'm telling you, because it was an experience that I had, and I'm still your patient there. And I'm comfortable, not for one or two misunderstandings I'm going to change if I've seen my doctor in pain more than 2 times, one especially not going to change my opinion in continuing to go to Healthpointe, Ontario 754 N. for 2 mistakes he had that person.
Atte .: Eduardo.I.San ...

Buen personal
Por el momento me an travado bien... espero y continuen asi.
Lo recomiendo,en especial con el Dr.Alupay,Pedro. El es mi doctor especialista en dolor de mano y brazo, con demasiada experiencia. Toma su tiempo en escuchar y el tiempo que necesites para poder explicarle tu incidente. Además cuentan con traductores para que sea posible el entendimiento entre los dos.
5 ☆☆☆☆☆ y si se pudiera hasta 10☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆  le ponía.
Oh y tienen clínicas en diferentes lugares,y buscan la clínica más cercana a tu hogar. Solo pregunta y ellos con toda amabilidad te facilitaran la más cercana ati.
Yo estoy asiendo ala que está situada en Ontario, por la avenida Mountain Avenue.
Su personal médico, todos hacen lo mejor para que los pacientes se sientan seguros de estar allí,si hay aveces tardan mucho tiempo para poder ser atendido, pero siempre es atendido por alguien, puede que haga una que otra excepción pero siempre es respetada la queja oh disgusto alguno,solo tiene que tener tranquilidad en cuando exprese su mal trato, y con toda la amabilidad se disculpara la mánager del lugar y tomara cartas en el asunto. Obviamente se le repondrá su cita con otro Dr- oh especialista diferente a el que la atendió.  Se los digo,porque fue una experiencia que tuve yo,y aún sigo siendo su paciente de allí. Y estoy agusto,no por uno oh dos mal entendidos voy a cambiar si llevo viendo a mi doctor en dolor más de 2 veses,un especialmente no va a cambiar mi opinión  en seguir yendo a Healthpointe, Ontario 754 N. por 2 errores que tuvo esa persona.

So sad to hear they are permanently closing. Three Twins has been a local staple and favorite of my family and friends for years. Their ice cream is the absolute best, unbeatable. Thanks for the great memories.</text>

My friends and I were trying samples before we decided to pick a flavor and the lady behind the counter said "this is your last sample" after our 2nd sample!! We thought this was a little rude and also a surprise (I have never encountered anything like this before).

I think the flavors are decent (nothing super exciting) and the prices are fair. Not the best ice cream but it will satisfy any cravings. Not a big fan of the service though.< /Text>< pics>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>My husband and I had a disastrous lunch and decided to find a treat to try and erase the terrible memory of that meal from our minds. That's how we found 3 Twins!
Lemon ice cream is not an easy flavor to master. Most ice cream producers do not. You end up tasting like you accidentally sprayed your grandmother's lemon pledge in your mouth but... Not here!!
The Lemon Cookie ice cream was excellent!!! Thoughts of lemon coolers (cookies) from my childhood came rushing back. Yum!!  The strawberry ice cream tasted more like a frozen yogurt. It was much too tart and not a strawberry piece to be found, though it did pair well with the Lemon cookie ice cream. My husband had a root beer float- the ice cream was great but the root beer was Hanson's- straight from the can. That was rather disappointing. It didn't pair well with the ice cream at all. We'd rather pay a bit more for a premium root beer that would compliment the ice cream better. Perhaps you'll offer a choice of root beers in the future?
We're definitely going back for the ice cream.. But we'll skip the root beer float.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<name>Sawyer Morton<//name><Text>The product was great! Service was AWFUL. Lost a customer unfortunately.  I came in wanting some delicious ice cream but the server, a young thin, tall girl with long brown hair in a ponytail  and hat seemed WAY less than thrilled to help. She did not seem happy to be working at all. She rolled her eyes, had a negative demeanor and I swear I could hear her and her coworkers talking about me behind their backs. The server forgot to ask if I wanted the ice cream in a cup or cone and when I saw her put it into a cup I asked if she could put the same scooped ice cream in a cone. Instead, she very wastefully threw out the ice cream in a cup and scooped me new ice cream. All around both employee’s demeanors were appalling. I work in retail and understand working with difficult customers but both these girls had an awful attitude. Me and my two friends that were there will not be coming back. Was happy to leave no tip.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1531968634075</Date>< Gmap_id>

The peanut butter chocolate flavor and lemon cookie flavor were really tasty. A little pricey ($3.50 for 2 flavors - 2 small scoops) but still delicious. Usually a line but it moves quickly. Inside the Oxbow market, so plenty of parking available in the area.</review>

< review>
Extremely disappointed. I knew it was close to their closing hours but my boyfriend and I walked up anyway because we saw another lady in front of us walk up and get waited on. We were really excited to try the ice cream. We waited our turn in line. After the lady in front of us walked away, we proceeded in line and walked up to the cash register. We stood their for a moment and the cashier then told us that they were closed. We were roughly a foot behind the other customer so it’s not like we were far away. I wish she would have said something when we got in line rather than pretend like it was a big surprise that they were closed. She talked to the girl in front of us like she knew her, which makes me think she waited on the girl because she knew her. The reviews make me feel like the ice cream was really good, which is why I’m giving it 2 stars, but I’m not sure if they deserve it after my experience.<//review>

<Review>My family had dessert here in August 2013 and absolutely loved the ice cream.  My 4 year hold inhaled his chocolate peanut butter scoop and came up asking for more.  My 2 year old liked his raspberry sorbet (one of two options they have with no egg).

But of course two young kids liked the ice cream.  The more discriminating palates belonged to my wife's parents, both of whom raved about the quality of the ice cream.  So, we'll go back.

One interesting thing they have posted on the wall is an invitation to purchase "the world's most expensive cup of ice cream."  For $60,000 the founder will hand make you all the ice cream you can eat from one of the disappearing glaciers on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro.  The idea is to call attention to global warming and the impact it is having on these glaciers.  Is it too wonky and ornery of me to point out that the shrinkage of those particular glaciers has nothing to do with CO2, but is rather due to changes in weather patters resulting from deforestation in the areas surrounding the mountain?  In any case, kudos to these guys for the clever idea.< /Review>< resp>

<Review>Three Twins Ice Cream is my favorite ice cream available in mass at grocery stores and so I was excited to get a scoop firsthand. I was surprised that the mint chocolate chip ice cream had more slivers of chocolate than chips. Nonetheless, I was stoked to get a kid's cup for $2.95. There are options to raise money with a $3K sundae...I'd love to see someone order that.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808506642df5542d:0xe8eb7f3ec39b93f<//gmap_id></record>

Not sure what the ice cream is like, because the kid behind the counter--while we were standing in line at 7:59pm--put up his closed sign and told us the people in front of us were the last customers of the night.  I explained that we had been waiting in line, and his response was "well, we close at 8 o'clock".  That kid needs a lesson in customer service.< /text>

The flavors are well done and the ice cream has a good creaminess to it. Try the sea salt caramel, chai cookie, and cardamon. DO get the burnt caramel sauce on top it's delish!< /review>

The cherry chocolate chip was awesome. The only problem was they ran out of some choices on a busy day.</Text>

<username>Merisa M< /username><review>If there was an Ice Cream King, Three Twins Ice Cream would be wearing the crown.  Omg, I've never had nor even heard of their ice cream before, but when a girlfriend of mine and I went on a little day trip to Napa, she told me that I had to give this place a try.

She and I had just eaten a huge lunch at a Taste of the Himalayas and were looking for a place to burn off some calories.  We mozied downtown and discovered the Oxbow Public Market (my new favorite food destination in Napa).  Instead of burning off calories we ended up taking more than our fair share in.  I sampled a few of their flavors and, quite honestly, my review would not be able to do their ice cream any justice, whatsoever, at all.  I had their Earl Grey Tea and Horchata ice cream and I seriously cannot believe I've never had them before.  Their ice cream is so light and sweet and true to flavor, I wish I could bathe in their ridiculously miraculous elixir known as Ice Cream batter.

My Reccomendations: try EVERYTHING!!! In fact, bring an ice chest with dry ice so you can even bring some ice cream home.  It's seriously, that amazing.<//review><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

After seeing the "Carl Van" in Fairfield, I decided that this is a Ice Cream I needed to try. So I headed to Vacaville and the Nugget Market: I knew they would have the Three Twins. And sure enough, I found the Twins. The selection was meager, with Vanilla, Mint Confeti and the cookie type. Digging into the back for the hardest, frozen container, I chose the Mint. That night after dinner we opened the container for the first time. We found the ice cream not creamy in appearance, but rather the consistency of ice milk, as if cream was not in it. Scooping into a cooled dish, the ice milk broke apart into liquid, chocolate chips, and crystals of a white mass. Tasting was not any better. It tasted milky, minty and ice chip crispy  We did not get the experience of  high quality ice cream that you get from Lourdes, Ben and Jerry's, Coldstone or  a commercial produced product.

I give Three Twin's Ice Cream a rating of 2 on a scale of 10. It is no better the ice milk.<//Text>

Quite delicious Ramen. Not really that spicy if you get the medium. If you want very spicy, I recommend ordering number 3 which is their spiciest level. The chasu slices are relatively thin. So if you're a meat lover you can go for more than 6 cuts of chasu.</review>

Excellent eggs and ChaSiu! It would have earned a five stars from me if the soup was served hot. Because the soup was barely warm, the fatty chasiu pork solidified and it looked like lard. The interior could use a makeover.<//text>

<review>Whether the regular tonkotsu or tsukemen, their ramen comes with delicious broth and flavorful slices of pork that disappear fast because I finish them so fast. The spot is a little hard to get to because it's not immediately obvious from the street, and not a lot of parking spots, but definitely worth it as one of the better ramen shops in the area. One of my favorites.</review><username>David Chien</username><Time>1542946034613< /Time><gmapID>0x80c2b5825de59d07:0xb65bcc9da10d1a9e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Not bad. Not amazing.

Had the spicy tonkotsu level 2 spice level. I added corn, butter, egg and 4 extra slices of chashu. I should have bumped up to spice level 3 or 4 as level 2 just had a spicy flavor and not actual heat. Still pretty good flavor with a bit too much sodium. The noodles were thin. The egg was cooked to a dry yolk consistency. The slices of chashu were thinly sliced. It melted in the broth and in your mouth.

Overall it's not bad, we didn't have to wait compared to a long line for some of the other ramen spots nearby. Service was quick and kind. Being as my friend lives close by, I'll be back to try some other offerings in hopes of finding something delicious.</review>

Decent noodles with a passable tonkotsu. Have tried a few bowls here but nothing stands out. Service has ranged from friendly to distracted. Tsukamen does not include soup wari at the end, which is a pretty standard part of the experience at most shops. Really can't recommend this when there are so many good shops in the area.<//Text>

<text>Expect a wait if you're coming at a popular time, but it's worth it! I love ordering the takoyaki and the spicy tsukemen (dipping ramen) here. While it's a bit on the pricey side, you can't really find a better ramen place in CA.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

The exterior is very unassuming but it actually serves pretty good quality ramen. The tonkotsu broth was flavorful, the teppan style gyoza was juicy and crispy. Deep fried gyoza was very good according to the friend that ordered it.</Review>

<Name>L A< /Name><review>This clinic is excellent.  I've been coming here for 5+ years and have trusted them with the well-being of three fur-kids - both canine and feline alike.  I love how they have a separate cat clinic! The care and service is high quality and I especially love that they always provide lots of options; I sense a great deal of concern and compassion for both myself as a customer and for my pets - this comes from everyone at each visit.  I'm so grateful for you Sunnyvale Vet!<//review><rating>5</rating>< Pictures>

Thank you Sunnyvale Veterinary crew, for being so proffesional and assertive! With your prompt reaction our dear puppies life was saved!
Also wanted to put it out there,
Zyrtec  = allergy medication for dog as well as humans
Zyrtec D = DEADLY for dogs , because it has sudoeffedrin.

For anyone who isn't informed, because I wasn't!</Text>

I took my puppy for her vaccines and 5 days later she had a fever and diarrhea and I had to take to them.  They told me she was dehydrated and that she need to spend the day at the clinic.  Just to make story short and after two days in the clinic and daily, X-Rays, a huge bill! the Vets still didn't know what was wrong with my puppy. The injected, sedated her causing her major pain on her limbs that she couldn't walk for days!
my poor puppy was suffering. When I asked them what happened to her why she was couldn't walk ? they didn't have an answer. They suggested more testing and x-rays.

She saw two Vets, and they contradict each other as far treatment goes.
It looks like they don't know what are they're doing!

I would definitively stay away from this Clinic, it's a money pit and not very helpful!!<//Text>

We recently had to euthanize our cat who we had brought to this vet clinic. The doctors and staff were very comforting and gave us as much time as we needed to prepare for the procedure. They also sent a thoughtful card following the procedure which we all appreciated.< /Text>

<text>My rabbit passed away in their care during a spay procedure. There was no way in telling how my baby would react to the anesthesia but unfortunately it took her life.

I chose this location because of their reviews and figured okay this must be a great place. I waited 3 months to get an appointment with a vet that "specialized" in rabbits. I dropped her off at 8:30am and was told she'd be ready for pick up after 3pm. I got a call around 10:30AM letting me know that she had stopped breathing and if I wanted them to continue to do CPR on her. I was upset they paused to call me to get permission even after the fact of me signing a contract that allowed for CPR.

They called me back at 11:05am informing me she had passed away and that there was nothing they could do. I felt so upset, depressed, and stressed out. It's been 3 weeks since her passing. One of the assistants informed me she had a spunky attitude and was grunting and giving attitude before she was put under. If they would've called me to inform me she was acting this was, I would've told them to not proceed with the spay because when she acts that was she's extremely upset and stressed out. I wish they would've called me so that I could've told them not to do it :( I will never ever bring any animal here again.

The saddest and worst part of it all was holding her deceased body and hearing the assistant on the line speaking to another patient about their guinea pig had trouble breathing after a procedure they've done and I just kept thinking there goes another dead animal under their care. They clearly don't have a good rep on small pets.

If you want your pet to live, please consider another location.<//text>< username>

I don't know what kind of magic this place is, but my cat isn't scared or mad or hiding like she usually is when she comes home from the vet.

I usually take my cats to their sister clinic, Oakridge.  But Oakridge was booked up for 6 weeks.  So we came here.  Obviously my cat is happy, and that's all I care about.  They were also excellent with the waiting in the car.  They responded quickly so you weren't wondering what was going on.<//Text>

<review>I'm concerned. Several people recommended this clinic but I have yet to see why. Each appointment we have had has been late by more than 30 minutes in getting the appointment started. This last one was due to several emergencies, so they say, which they could have let us know when we first checked in. I find a business that is disrespectful of my time is not one I want to continue doing business with. I'm not sure if this is because our entire relationship has been through Covid but in a time where appointments are being limited communications should be clearer and I'm not impressed so far. To their credit though they seem have a good bedside manner with  our pup.</review>< Pics>

<review>Pro: They are doing their best.
Con: They are doing their best.

Whew, where to even start with this one. Sweet staff, but very disorganized (think: Bless their hearts). Every time you interact with someone its like you are starting over from scratch and no one talks to each other. Perhaps we had such a hard time due to their strict COVID policies, as I'm sure its really hard for a vet to understand a pet owner's needs from the phone in the parking lot.

Our top priority for our 17 year old cat is to keep her happy for whatever remaining time she has. Sadly, seems like this message was never received. We brought her in for a check of thyroid so that we could continue getting refills of meds, and for eye drops/meds for itchy eyes. Somehow the vet talked us into checking for worms so that we could also buy her flea medicine b/c a flea jumped onto one of them during the visit (supposedly from my cat - who I hold, cuddle and am around 24 hours every day and this has never happened to me...?). During that first visit they 'couldn't get the blood' b/c she was too upset (probably by the two HUGE dogs that went in right after her...?), so there's another visit. Also she had "A LOT of plaque" build up (never heard about that again so I guess it got better...?).

If you are like me and choosing this vet b/c of the cat clinic, think again. They rarely use the cat clinic. 2 of the 3 visits we had were at the normal clinic. We had to beg to get into the cat clinic for the second visit so that we could make sure they would be able to get the blood (all this so that we can continue a medication we know the cat needs). We also had to beg to allow one of us to accompany her to help keep her calm for the blood draw. In general, it always felt like, we say "jump", you say "how high?"

The final straw was the eye drops. After checking her eyes at the first visit, they allowed one refill of the eye drops but then insisted that they needed to re-check (also had the audacity to again suggest fleas, perhaps forgetting we already did the stool sample so you could test for worms and prescribe flea meds that she didn't need?). Again, we are looking to keep this cat comfortable for whatever precious time we have left. Policies are policies but when it comes at the expense of my pet that is where I have to draw the line.<//review><GmapID>0x808fb6ed8a948807:0x6c84679e1fad032c</GmapID>< Date>

Overall we like this Vet they treat our dog very well. The only issues we have with them is that they tend to be on the expensive side for services and it can be hard to get your pet in sometimes as they are very busy. The level of care is very good though and that’s what’s most important.<//Text>

<Text>We've been taking our kitties to the Sunnyvale Vet for the last five years and the care they give is unlike any vet I've ever been to. I was so happy when they opened the cat clinic because my cats had never encountered a dog, and with the cat clinic, it's one less thing to stress them out. The vets and techs really treat your pets like their own which is a wonderful experience bit I have to give a shout out to Dr. Haney for her warm and loving touch with my babies. If you are looking for a vet, take your kitties here - you won't be sorry.</Text><Response>None<//Response><Rating>5</Rating><gmapID>0x808fb6ed8a948807:0x6c84679e1fad032c<//gmapID>< UserId.>

I've been bringing my cat here ever since I adopted her. She hates the vet. She doesn't like being touched in general, so the doctor who also sometimes gives her shots is her least favorite outing. Despite that, the staff here are fantastic with her. They know how to handle her for her safety and theirs. While she still hates the vet, I'm quite happy with their service. The staff really does care about animals and will make sure they are taken care of.< /text>

My dog is not good around other dogs and they were accommodating in letting me call and come in/out on the side to avoid the main lobby. However there is a note in my file saying that I would prefer my dog not see male vets. He is already fearful (and can be mildly aggressive) to strangers, especially in a strange environment like the vets' office. I was not told that Dr. Huang was not in during the requested date and therefore not told that he would be seeing a male vet instead. There was unnecessary stress for all of those involved which could have been easily avoided. I even told the assistant/tech at the desk to make sure that it was in his file to only see the female vet and they said the alert was already there....

I'm not sure I will be coming back. I don't usually take things this seriously but I put a lot of effort in setting my dog up for success but this surely has set him back quite a bit.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>They took good care of my kitty. I was able to get an appointment the day of, and did not have to wait.

<username>karen martinez</username><pics>None< /pics><Text>So I have a dog who is somewhat reactive around other dogs. The staff here are always very accommodating and helpful. They treat my dog like he is special (even though they see lots of dogs all day). I really can’t say enough about how friendly and nice the staff are. Surely the metric of any business is the happiness of its employees. I feel that the owners must treat the staff very well in order to have the workers so friendly, efficient and helpful.

Nice place. They love the animals and it shows. Two separate buildings, one for dogs, one for cats and other small animals. But the surgery is in the dog building. My cat was fine after his neuter though, even though he doesn't like dogs, they kept him separate enough, that he handled it.</Text>

They know vet visits can be expensive and did what they could to cut costs for our two dogs. They also don't push unnecessary supplies, diets, or medications like some places do. And it's soa thoughtful to have a cat clinic in a separate building from the main clinic.<//Review>< Rate>

<review>Updated review (11/2019):
When I took my dog in for a GI issue, I left with the recommendation for a teeth cleaning. I asked for a cost estimate from the desk before I left, who quoted me $400 for routine cleaning and up to $1200 if something came up, like an extraction. Today, one business hour before his surgery dropoff (they emailed me one hour before close on Saturday when I need to drop him off Monday morning, vet is closed Sunday), I get a written quote saying that the procedure will cost at a minimum $1700 and can range to $2400. That was 4x what I was quoted in person! The quadrupled cost from what they originally quoted me and the late notice were completely unprofessional. Additionally, this call one hour before close reminded me to give my dog his pre-procedure medication Sunday night. They had never given me any medication. When I called to ask, they said it was too late for me to come in to pick it up since they were about to close, which came off as super careless. Overall, the clinic was disorganized, unprofessional, and greedy. This horrendous experience has cost them a client.

Some vets are friendlier and more knowledgeable than others.  Overall, very friendly staff and integration with online health tool for your pet(s) is nice. And making appointments via email is convenient.  One ding for putting us in a room that just had a dog with fleas.</Review>

Only go here if you want the absolute "best" care and a price point to match.  Don't be fooled by the low(ish) base cleaning cost for dental, a single tooth extraction can cost an additional $500-800 (actual quote, not an exaggeration).  For one tooth.  Because of a special certificate.  Service did not feel personal, they couldn't keep my dog's gender straight even while talking to me on the phone while she was on the table under anesthesia.< /text>

<review>Jan 18(THUR): Everything seems good until I receive the doctor’s email about my cat’s lab test. Dr Smith is very nice, to me and my cat. We talked about one thing I’m concerned of, my cat’s alleviated ionized calcium level. I didn’t remember the exact term then, but when I said ionized something, she said she remember there was one indictor slightly high. She also rest assured me that some cats might just have a slightly high level, if it stays stable like that. She suggested to do a blood test and I happily agreed. However, the blood test result include everything except ionized calcium level!! She suggested in the email to do a blood test of that next time I visit! Immediately I wrote back on Monday, I didn’t hear back so I followed up an email on Wednesday to check, but today I still don’t hear anything back. I know I’m getting a bit impatient here, but I really want to know where goes wrong. How come the only thing I care about missing from the test result. The ratings are so high here, and also the bill, so I had very high expectations for this place, but I don’t even get a reply?

I’ll adjust this rating to 3 star if I hear back, adjustable based on how this situation is handled.

Jan 19 (FRI) update: After I sent a follow up email and posted my review on Thursday, I heard back from a staff this morning, asking me if she can schedule me with another doctor because my doctor is on leave and discuss my concerns, but I told her I want to know what happened. Not long after that, I got a missed call and received an email from the manager, she told me the test for cats under 7 years old doesn't include calcium level. To test calcium level is to run a specific test called i-Stat, and the test requires the cat be fasted for 12 hours. Surprise surprise surprise - none of these were communicated. She offered me to do that at no cost, but I feel I haven't figured out why this happened, so I'm not sure if I should do it here.
Anyway, I promised I will adjust the rating, so I bring it up to 3.</review>< pics>

<review>Fast and very efficient clinic. Brought my 12 yr old cat for a checkup, vaccines and blood work. They were not able to draw blood from her on first try. As my cat got too anxious.

Always helpful. Always fits us in. Always checks up on our animals. And I actually trust them. I was taking my cat to a dermatologist before and he was getting worse, I thought he was going to die and I was spending so much money. I took my cat here and he started getting better right away. He actually doesn't even mind going to the vet now and loves going to get groomed there. I am so grateful I found this vet😁<//text>

Our cat had check-up and had a health certificate issued for international travel.
All the stuff were nice and helpful and super kids+cat friendly. Oh and of course, the vet is USDA certified. The health records access is provided via internet (app).< /Review>

despite several decades of continued loyalty to this clinic our family was treated like garbage. They are rude and judgmental.  Vicky the "office manager" was unprofessional, argumentative and clueless.  Office managers typically work to help make a situation better, not worse.

There are so many other good clinics to choose from.  Despite the terrible customer service, the prices are ridiculously high.  Terrible service and high prices - not a good combination.<//review>

A good small local vet. Open weekends which is a huge plus. It can sometimes be hard to get an appointment for last minute needs because they're so busy.</Text>

The people at this clinic really care about your cat(s), which is the main thing when you're looking for a veteranarian. You certainly will get excellent treatment and your pet will be looked after in detail. On the flip side there are two negatives: it is expensive, and there are frequent mistakes in administration. As long as you make sure to call twice, and separately record what you heard and verify that it is indeed correct, your cats will as happy as they can be with a doctor.< /Review>

<Text>We have been coming to Sunnyvale Vet Clinic for nearly five years. We have become frequent visitors recently due to aging pets. We've seen several vets at this clinic, but I think Dr. Smith and Dr. Davison are our favorites.  In January, one of our dogs had a mass removal surgery and Dr. Smith did a fantastic job. She kept us updated throughout the day.  We also saw Dr. Davison recently, and I really appreciated how much time and care she took with my dog and with me in explaining what was wrong. It's great going to a vet that loves my dogs as much as I do.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

In an area (the greater South Bay region) that can be prone to pretense and frills, it's nice to find a veterinary group that provides good service for good value.

We have been taking our dog here for almost a year now, since we first got him as a puppy. We've had nothing but good service - and he's been through a lot! His ear was mauled by a husky and required surgical repair. He had his neuter here. He also had an umbilical hernia repair. He came to us with worms and fleas that they helped us rid. They've also provided guidance in avoiding spending too much of our money on ridiculously expensive dog foods. (He's spoiled enough as it is!)

This place is not a boutique-style veterinary office with fancy flat panel LED TVs. They don't particularly push you to buy any of the few products they sell there, except of course any prescription medications your pet might need. Even when prescribing medications, they try to go for the cheapest, most effective option. They've even passed forward manufacturer rebates for oral deworming medication.

Overall, I really can't recommend this place enough. We've a healthy, awesome puppy and don't feel like I'm being manipulated everytime I go to the vet.< /review>

<text>They were able to accomodate us on very short notice, and they were super friendly, open and welcoming to us.

Our dog is very shy since she comes from an abused background, and they were very patient and gentle with her which made the visit really easy.  I liked how open our vet was with us.  She also didn't make us feel rushed even though it was a short appointment and we had a lot of questions to ask.  She made us feel instantly comfortable, and she helped address both medical and emotional issues with our dog.

I absolutely recommend bringing your pet here for a visit.  I also thought that they were pretty reasonable compared to similar quality veterinary clinics in the area.<//text>< Response>

The first thing is that they will provide the best medical care that is available for your pet if you can pay for it.
Since however vet care is also getting expensive due to rising medical prices everywhere in the US, feel free to talk with the staff or Dr Singh if you are price sensitive, and ask for options.
Dr Singh, the owner, got back to me after I contacted his staff with some pricing concerns I had, did his very best to handle the concern, and honestly he was the most honest and person with integrity that I had dealt with in a while.< /Review>

< review>
The veternarians at Sunnyvale Veternary Clinic are all focused, up to date on the latest technologies and clearly love what they do.  We typically see Dr. Wright or Dr. Singh.  We've been with them for years and have come to love the respect, dedication to our dogs, and the time they give us answering any and all our questions.  The office is very clean and run efficiently.  The front desk staff, the technicians and the doctors have my highest recommendations.  We have rotties and they treat our dogs like family members.  We recently were treating our female rott for an auto immune issue, we were engaged and involved in her treatment and the doctors gave us options to weigh.  We received check in calls and updates on any test results as soon as possible.  They were wonderful with her.</review>

We had the same experience as #KimA. Rude staff, over priced, and play the guilt card to make a sale. Completely unethical behavior that does the opposite of establishing trust with their patients & their animals. We were members for a year, they were great with our puppy's first couple rounds of shots and vaccines, however when it came time for the one year booster we came in to find they could not locate the records on our pup until they searched around for 15min, they then continued to claim that he had not had his 3round and needed to re-vaccinate for everything previous as well as the one year booster. When I tried to double check them-politely saying I don't understand because I have records from this clinic stating that he has had these vaccines- they were very defensive and insisted that we do them anyway because "you just can't ever be to careful with your loved ones". The office manager slid a quote over to me for their claims, it was halfway to 4digits just for an additional exam and the vaccines. Needless to say we walked out never to return. - Customer Service & Pricing Catalog needs major improvement. Your customers are starting to put the story together.<//review>

Top of the line data center.  CoreSite Data Center are way up there.  Very good service and no down time so far.  Best choice I made as an IT executive.<//Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>I had another great experience with these guys.  My computer acted 2 weeks after I had it in for service.  It turned out that it was not a result of the previous occurance.  The guys took their time to figure out what the problem was and fixed them for me and gave me a break on the cost as well.  I am a devoted customer and fan.  Thanks guys!< /review>< pictures>

Fantastic acoustics and space, especially considering it’s on a high school campus.

Rental rates are more reasonable than other local theaters, but the fly system is only a half fly, which can make lighting and scenery harder to accommodate.< /Text>

I've been taking classes from this school for 10months. it was a long jorney and I'm relished that I could study at this school. Even though we have to take classes vitually, the teachers who taught me English did the best for us. I won't forget the memories with them and the class. Thank you Poly! (For Kenny, David, Jack, Arron and Jenny I could be more interested in English because of you guys!!)<//text>

<review>Poly is an awesome school! Teacher Sean Mahoney is always excited, takes the class to the subjects proposed in the book in a fun way.  My other teacher is Collern, very friendly and dedicated to taking us to class, teaching and correcting where we fail.
The whole communication team is doing very well.  Thanks for the support with administrative things and access to the school's education system.  It is good to have you. I'm satisfied.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The best school I’ve ever studied at, nice people, awesome, very patient and well prepared teachers who were able to help me at any time. I definitely recommend Poly Languages to who want to improve their English skills to an upper level and who desires to go to a college. Thanks Poly. Five stars.<//Review>

<Review>The staff at the Irvine campus are unethical, cheaters and rude. According to their own policy under Students Right to Cancel stating, The student has the right to cancel the enrollment agreement and obtain a refund of charges paid through attendance at the first class session, or the seventh day after enrollment, whichever is later. If the student cancels by the 1st class session, there is a full refund. Thereafter is a cancellation fee of $150.00. He canceled on the 1st day when he went to advise the front desk he would not be able to attend. They advised he would get a refund in full within 30 days. It didn't happen. We had to go in person twice to get a partial refund back then told to dispute the balance of $150.00 from corporate. The manager had the audacity to tell me that I was taking money away from their operations and ability to operate their phone system by requesting a refund, a refund due and promised. DUE not apply to or attend this school as they are unethical in their practices. I've never received worse customer service from any organization.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I highly recommend Poly Irvine to those who want to have much opportunity to speak up in classes. The teachers are all patient, supportive and respectful to all of the students from various backgrounds. Plus, the administrators are willing to hear from the students about any improvements no matter how trivial it is. I am so satisfied with the 3 months I spent in this school.< /Text>

GREAT TEACHERS, GREAT ADMINS! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED <3
I studied there at POLY Irvine for 2months. Even though it was short, I loved studying here. First of all, They have one of the greatest teacher. They are passionate about their job, teaching - e.g. I loved Ray's class<3, I usually got there early 30 minutes or so in the morning and could notice him drinking coffee in his classroom preparing for his class while entire school is still in peace and silence. In addition, the environment that teachers produce here is more like family/friends-oriented, teachers recognize each individuals' English weakness and would bring extra paper works for the students.
Secondly, Poly Irvine have friendly, helpful, and thoughtful staffs. They were always willing to help the students with patience, make you feel comfortable to ask for a help even though your English is not perfect so it takes time. Overall, I learned lots of knowledge and had great time studying here!!! Wish you all the best, Thank you Ray, Monique, Mechelle, Lawrence, Kristine!</Text>

I was grateful to learn in here.
Especially, teacher Kenny was the greatest guy I have ever met. He was enthusiastic and knew how to teach international students.
And Lawrance who is a manager of the school was friendly and could manage the school very well :)
I liked Kyungwon teacher as well. Her teaching style and skills were good enough to developing conversational skills.< /Text><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

I recommend POLY school of Irvine.
I wanted to go to a school which does not have many Japanese staff and students.That's why I choose the school.
It was hard for me to communicate with the staff, but They always care about student's learning envionment and what we want to do.
Teachers are also good because they have a lot of experience for our fun and understanding.
In addition, we can join a lot of event for communication with other students.
I had a good time in POLY and it's really good place to learn English.< /Text>

If you want to learn English quickly and efficiently, Poly Languages lnstitute is the best place. The teachers as well as the office staff are both excellent. I attended the school for only two months. It was a short while, but we had a good time.You can improve your English in a short amount of time.
I will be trying to this experience into something positive.</review>

Recommended this place to my 26-year-old cousin, who before attending Poly couldn't speak English. I saw her 6 months later and she's reading novels and watching American reality tv shows without captions. She's tried learning English several times before coming to Poly but none of those old methods ever really worked because she'd get bored or overwhelmed. However, the teachers at Poly know how to make learning English interesting and the right amount of challenging. The staff is really nice too not just to her, but to me when I visited the campus to hang out with her. It's great seeing how fluent she's become thanks to Poly.< /text>

< Review>
Poly languages is a great school. I joined the non intensive program in the afternoon. I was the only student. But I had a lot of fun. My teacher had a good style to teach the grammar and he was very patient. He always asked me what I need and what I am interested in. I was always very happy after my lesson, I learned a lot and I regret that I couldn't stay longer.  Also the contact with the office for the arrangement before I came here was very polite and uncomplicated. Tankyou so much !<//Review>

I transferred from UCI Extension to Poly Languages Insitute at Irvine due to prices, and it was one of the best decisions I made. The teachers are extremely helpful, and there is incredibly kind faculty, and a clean learning environment.

Help was given when I asked with warm regards.
I strongly recommend going to this school.</text>

I like POLY.
At first I was afraid to talk with teachers but they were very kind to me. So now, I like to talk with teachers every day. They are friendly and funny.
There is not only nice teachers and also nice students. I could meet best friends at POLY who are from other country.
I got good memories from POLY.</text>

<Review>I came from the UCI transfer to POLY, for me this school is better than UCI. I've been studying here for two months and I feel good and I can feel my progress. My teacher is Jason, this is the best English teacher I've ever met. He is very patient and experienced. I will recommend my friends and family to learn together～< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcde6069861909:0x24f846a201d1ace6<//GmapID></record>

<review>This school is a joke! We signed up my sister for Listening & speaking class. The couple of employees there that I spoke with over the phone don't speak very good English themselves! My sister says that the teacher never let the students talk. He would look up spellings on his cell and that you couldn't read his writing  on the board. When we brought it up to the director of school's attention he made no offers to resolve the issue and just kept making excuses. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!! These people are thieves and have VERY Poor customer Service!!!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The teachers taught me well so that all of them could be understood, and the staff were very kind and attentive. There was plenty of parking and the occasional events were very fun.

처음 미국에 와서 영어때문에 걱정이 많았는데 폴리에 다니면서 자신감을 얻고 영어도 많이 늘었습니다.
선생님들 모두 이해가 쉽도록 잘 가르쳐주셨고, 스텝분들도 친절하시고 세심한 부분까지 신경써 주셔서 감사했습니다. 주차장도 넉넉하고 가끔 하는 행사도 재밌어서 아주 즐거운 시간이었습니다.<//text><Rating>5<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

When I came here, I got a lot of English and I talked to people from other countries. There are so many parties and events that you can easily adapt at first.
Teachers are all fun and have a fair chance to speak so they can practice speaking English!
If you do not know what to do when you first come to the US and study English, I recommend Foley here!

처음 미국에 와서 엄청 긴장하고 힘들었을때 여기 Poly’s staff가 많이 도와줘서 여러가지 재미있는 경험을 했어요. 여기에 와서 영어 실력도 많이 올랐고 다른나라 사람들이랑 만나서 이야기를 하다보니까 보는 시야와 생각들이 많이 바뀌었어요. 많은 파티나 이벤트가 있어서 처음엔 힘들어도 쉽게 적응할수 있을거에요.
선생님들도 다들 재미있으시고 말할기회를 공평하게 주셔서 영어 말하는 연습을 충분히 할수있어요!
처음 미국에와서 영어 공부 할려고 할때 뭐해야할지 모르겠다면 여기 폴리를 추천합니다!!<//Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I am French and I came to this school to learn English for my studies. The classes are attractive thanks to fun activities. It allowed me to progress well in English. On the negative side, my last class was removed and I had to go back to the lower level to continue studying (a solution I had to find myself because the office did not anticipate this change and it is not always very conciliatory ...).

(Original)
Je suis française et je suis venue dans cette école pour apprendre l’anglais pour mes études. Les cours sont attractifs grâce à des activités ludiques. Cela m’a permis de bien progresser en anglais. Point négatif, ma dernière classe a été supprimée et j’ai dû revenir dans le niveau inférieur pour pouvoir continuer à étudier (solution que j’ai dû trouver toute seule car le bureau n’avait pas anticipé ce changement et il n’est pas toujours très conciliant...).<//Review>

<review>Got a pollo asado quesadilla. The chicken was not great. Some pieces still looked very light, and it didn't even seem like it was grilled. It kinda tasted like microwaved chicken. It was still edible, but I definitely would not order this or come here again...

Update: This food made me feel sick. No way was that chicken fresh. Overall low quality. Beware.</review>< pics>

This is my new favorite place!!!

We went for lunch and it wasn't crowded and we were promptly served.
The portions are generous for their low prices.

Bonus for having menudo every day and not just specific times.

The food was delicious and exceeded my expectations. This is authentic and fresh.

Friendly and accommodating for kids.<//Text>

On a weeknight this place is pretty dead. It's a large space, with seating spread out. The counter is in the back, staff is okay. The menu is well sized....the food was made rather quickly so I was surprised at that. If you eat in, it's served on real plates.

I got the cheese enchilada combo. Pretty good...fair amount of cheese, a lot of sauce, beans, and rice. I wish it was a tad bit warmer, but it was alright.<//Text>

Personally I think these other negative reviews are totally bogus. They were probably rude in the first place. I think that this place is amazing and is my favorite place to eat. They treat me like family there, they remember what I order and like to drink. The food is amazing, especially their breakfast burritos. If you do end up coming here, please do yourself a favor and buy one of those. 5/5 :)</Text>

I went there with my mother and she gave them a 50 dollar bill for a 20 dollar bill. They didn't give her back her change. It's sad that elderly people get taken advantage of. We wont go back.<//Text>

I Never Been here before but the very first time I come the GUY was plain Rude, We ordered food my Co-workers and I, simply the food was such less amount and expensive we had to order extra food our burrito was like a home made looking like taco bell burrito, and then he never offered us chips and salsa. only to the other customers right in front of us! Our burrito had a hair, he offered our money back, I said No i would just never come here again.</text>

Just went today.  I ordered a chili verde burrito.   It tasted ok but it actually was carnitas and beans.   My mouth was watering for a green chile, tomatillos, onions, possibly cheese burrito .  This was not a chili verde burrito.   I'm disapointed.  The staff was friendly.   But no chips and salsa.  I ordered water and paid for it.< /Review>

Great friendly family run restaurant!  Fresh, delicious food.  What you want when you want Mexican food, take out or large eat in seating area.  It's down the street from my studio, they see me a lot!  Excellent salsa, hot carrots, beef tacos, chili rellenos, enchiladas, tostadas, I've had them all and it's all good. Highly recommended.< /Text>

The male whom answer the phone doesn't even answer to clearly understand the language of USA.
As I mention of the small menu.
Next I mention of my searching of not much selection of burritos, as many other 'mexican restaurant's have  --- vs 'El Mariachi.'

But the male whom listen to me not really understand; nor really care.
My last asking of "How hot is your salsa?"
As he not even understand it, by him not making a sound.
Just another business of employee/s that don't care not understand of what they do. Nor communicate their behavior with their customers.< /text>

I think his rent is expensive that's why his food is a little higher than the other Mexican restaurants.</Review>

This place is much more than a taco shop. They have a wide variety of harder to find items such as: Caldo de Rez, Menudo, Shrimp plates, Enchiladas, etc.
You may have to wait a bit longer for food to be prepared, but it is worth your while!< /text>

We were there a week ago ,looking for some real Mexican food and we finally found it.This restaurant had good food,the prices were not bad at all .The staff was great,the place very clean and overall food was so great that we ate there twice.If anyone vacations in san Diego or lives around there and is looking for real Mexican authentic food this restaurant is it.If we ever go again well definitely stop to eat at this restaurant El Mariachi Mexican restaurant ..Thanks to the staff for there good food and service....<//review>

I called the tire shop today and Carlos looked for the tires I needed and rechecked on exact specifications I was looking for although I placed him on hold while I took another call. When I arrived he again assisted me courteously. The technician outside (didn't know his name) told me it'd be about 30 minutes and it was. Great service with a smile. And the Mgr. answered a question I had afterwards; very professional. Very pleased. Bravo!< /review>

< Review>
I was told by the guy who checked me in it would take 55 minutes, they would call me when ready. I checked on my car after not hearing anything for about an hour and a half. Had not even started it. Was told it would be another 3 hours. When asked why I was told 55 minutes I was told" dunno".  Got my keys and took my car across the road to jiffy lube where I was in and out in under 30 minutes for only 4 bucks more!! Such a joke!!</Review>

<review>We stopped in at dinner time on a Tuesday evening without a reservation and were promptly seated. The menu is quite varied with many interesting items. We had appetizers and a combination of seafood and chicken for our entrees. Everything was presented nicely and was delicious. Beers were also reasonably priced. I will definitely visit again.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Spouse had been there 2 times before we took the family. Kinda to try various dishes. They’re all Great, portions are generous, the seafood and ceviche done differently but very delicious. Nice cold beers and wine plus save room for desserts! Nice variety of them. Atmosphere is very Family friendly. Highly recommended.</Review>

Amazing Food! I’ve been going here for a couple of years. Food is always fresh, great tasting and the staff is always very pleasant. Looking forward to be able to dine outside there again! Take out is not the same as it is when it comes fresh from the kitchen.</Text>

This family owned business takes pride in preparing traditional Peruvian food with love.  The service is fantastic and I guarantee that you'll pay more for lower quality Peruvian cuisine in the greater LA area.  The attached pictures are from the $10 lunch special menu and the flavor was exceptional.  Do yourself a favor and check it out!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>The sangria!!!!! They put love into their dishes. You can really taste the authenticity in the meal. Plus the staff is always friendly and hospitable. Decor is adorable and in these pandemic times, they have lovely outside seating. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal from Misky Misky and am excited to return for more!<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate><UserId.>113223942901337655387< /UserId.>< user_name>

Because of the pandemic, I know things are different in many places. This is our first coming to Misky Misky. My husband and father in law had the Saltiado de Marisco they enjoyed it. My mother in law had the Pollo con Chimichurri, she said it didn't have flavor and it needed more Chimichurri. I had the Aguadito de Mariscos. It didn't have an actual flavor. The best way I can describe it is like green water with rice and seafood. I did like the amount of mariscos it had though. I did noticed it got pretty busy.</text>

<Review>Although this has been one of my favorite places , I have to rate service and food a 1 star. I initially ordered ceviche mixto, and fish just tasted watery almost like it has been de frozen not able to taste Lemon and miss flavors well . Only one server available , felt rushed . She was taking care of patio orders , 5 tables w clients . Patio didn’t seem cleaned , and organized . I exchange order for lomo saltado , which had good taste . In the other hand , I order milanesa with fries for my son, chicken was hard to chew .< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c32901696e0843:0x5d24d408a4b5323b< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Great place to eat. Come early enough because the parking lot fills up fast and the waiting room is small. We went on a Friday night and just made it before the crowd at 8pm hit. Food was really good. I highly recommend this place to anyone. The line and crowd showed how good and popular this place is.</text>< response>

<review>Great service, even better food! Lomo saltado for the win. The purple drink is pretty good too. I think it's made from Inca purple corn. ceviche mixta is also really good. Oh also instead of chips or bread they give you dried corn.<//review><user_id>104170323033777184562< /user_id><Rating>5<//Rating><user_name>Andrew Wong< /user_name></record>

<Review>Having been to Peru... the service was great. The food needs some work. The portions are a little cheap given the prices and the food is too salty. Instead of a juicy bite into some anticucho... it was dry and salty. the only balance I found was with the Camote but... again the portion was very small. Has potential to be better but not there yet.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGMK96-BMydQLhyoQxpdv0lklji7nfHxRm7q8Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtfjKjJsJLkCtpsRL-jLrBdLDS2RvjtoOYh2-g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

I like Peruvian food however this restaurant features seafood which, unfortunately, I am allergic to. Big Ceviche menu-$12-17. This casual restaurant is very clean and comfortable. Wait staff is very efficient & they all help one another which equals good service. Waitress brought two small plates with an appetizer of fried corn and Habanero-Jalapeno sauce. Very different. I had the Chimichurri chicken which was a thinly sliced chicken breast fried and Chimichurri on top. White rice and a nice salad. Only $9 on lunch menu.<//review>

The food was good. However I was not expecting the heads, tails, and all the legs on my shrimp in my shrimp and corn chowder. I had to fish them out of my soup. Clean then and then put them back in.< /Review>

Fresh and flavorful food, quick and tentative service, welcoming atmosphere. Location is a bit out of the way, in a hidden corner of West Covina, but close to the 10. If I'm ever in the neighborhood again, I'll be back!<//review>

My family is Peruvian and we love the ceviche and lomo saltado from Misky Misky! There are a few dishes that are definitely more on the “fusion” side and not necessarily bad, just not traditional Peruvian food. The service here is top-notch and the food is always delicious!< /Review>

Lomo saltado is the best I have had. A bit pricey but well worth it. Definitely planning in coming back again soon.< /text>

<Text>My family is Peruvian and we love the ceviche and lomo saltado from Misky Misky! There are a few dishes that are definitely more on the “fusion” side and not necessarily bad, just not traditional Peruvian food. The service here is top-notch and the food is always delicious!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I have been here twice, and ordered the chaufa with chicken both times. Its basically a fried rice dish and delicious. It is served with a spicy green sauce, and I asked what was in the sauce and was told it was a secret. The filet mignon empanadas were very good also. Try the purple corn beverage.  It reminds me of jamaica , but incorporates a cinnamon flavor. I've yet to travel to Peru but I feel based on the offerings here I wouldn't have to worry about the food when I got there! They have patio seating for dine in.< /Review>

<Text>I had the Linguine a la Huancaina w/lomo and it was delicious! The Lomo Saltado was also very good. As an appetizer we had the chicken and beef empanadas and they did not disappoint.

<Text>Considering the conditions that we are living in, I must say that most eateries have done a great job adapting to the circumstances. With this being said, I recommend we, as a community, continue supporting small businesses in this time of Covid. As for Misky, it's take out food was delicious, as it had been pre-Covid. The spices (flavoring) are in line with past meals in-house; the ceviche-just as fresh, lemony, tender morsels of yum; the lomo saltado with it's pungent onions and bell peppers & french fries sopping up all the juices released from the protein & veg--still delicioso. All these flavor profiles remeniscent of carefree months long ago. The chicken chaufa and green rice have been more flavorful in the past, but overall not too disappointing. I'm glad this family owned restaurant didn't go the way side and shutter it's doors for good (like other local places), and there is comfort  knowing that I can anticipate ordering more goodness and it won't be a disappointment. I would suggest ordering by phone ahead and tack on 15 minutes to their projected wait time, because this place is still as popular as ever. There is no delivery available (bummed, but ok) at this time (as of 7/31). The patio area is on the smallish side, but it is open for dining-al-fresco, and you'll have to order first, pay and then be seated. Please be patient with the staff there aren't many servers to keep pace, but that's out of the abundance to maximize their earnings & expenses. BE WELL, WEAR YOUR MASK, and I'll be seeing you on the gastronomic highway of life.< /Text>< resp>

Absolutely Loved this place! The food is fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. We were a party of 13 for a birthday celebration and everything was perfect! We each had different dishes and all were great! I’d go again and have what the other person had! A nice change, try it!</Review>

Today we went to Misky Misky  to celebrate Father's Day, so sad to see how the food and service is not up to were they used to be.  I understand that things have changed that we need to adhered to the changes but it was very disappointing.

First you have to decide as you enter what you are going to eat and drink, pay and then choose your table (awful).  It took over 20 minutes for someone to bring the drinks that were already prepared and in top of the counter.  No one brought silverware and napkins until we asked, usually they place on the table toasted salted corn with sauces as a courtesy, today they charged for it.  Then it took another 40 minutes and  they brought the food, the rice wasn't completely cooked, the appetizers came after the main dishes and the anticuchos were super thin, dry and over cooked, the potatoes a la huancahina was one potato cut in 5 slices with a little bit of a sauce that didn't have any flavor.  I couldn't believe the service, they never brought the water that we requested when we entered, the server "never" came to check if we needed refills on the coffee and drinks.  I have been going to this restaurant since they opened and never disappointed today was ridiculously bad and the place was not even close to be full, what a waist of $120 we won't be coming back.  We have gone to other restaurants and even though they have to maintain social distancing the food and service have improved because they want patrons to come back sorry to say Misky Misky is not trying to give their patrons a good dinning experience at this time.< /text>

<text>Came here a couple weeks ago with some friends and wasn't disappointed. First time having Peruvian food and I thought it was odd to have fries with the meal described, but it was delicious! The meat was juicy and the everything was well seasoned. Will definitely go back and try something else the next time I am in town.</text>< user>

We tried the Mixto and Leche de Tigre, ceviches and green rice. Nice presentation and the service was friendly; HOWEVER, four hours later two people in our party got stomach cramps and other issues.
We aren't sure if it was the green rice, the mussels, or the seaweed on the ceviche. Too bad  because we really wanted to like Misky Misky.< /text>

It was so delicious. It's the 2nd time trying Peruvian food.  It was much better this time around. There were about 3 families celebrating birthdays. So it was quite lively for a Tuesday night. But I can see why, the food was so delicious. I can't wait to go back.<//review>

I am part Peruvian and have to say yes it tastes authentic. Yes but most importantly yes! It's good. Had the ceviche nikkei shown in my picture with corn and ají. Never had a tuna ceviche but was very tasty especially with the ají sauce. They give you the choice to choose the spice level for the ceviche. Also had the chupe de camaron and was too deep into it I forgot to take a picture. It was extremely tasty and I don't see this type of dish at any Peruvian restaurant. I plan to go back and have more!</Review>< date>

<text>It's  a nice place.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and the food is great. I had the salmon and salad they were both delicious.  I was worried the salad would be plain, it wasn't. I noticed they also serve alcohol.

We went in in a Saturday about 5. There were only a few people.  The place suddenly filled up. There wasn't an empty table and I  can understand why. Someone next to us was celebrating a birthday, the staff made it special.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c32901696e0843:0x5d24d408a4b5323b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great place for Peruvian food. Came here to see how they compare to Mr. Pollo couple miles away. Turns out same owners. The ceviche was really fresh. We also got the Tallarin Verde con Bistek and the Lomo Saltado which were both really good. The steaks were really tender and flavorful. The fries in the Lomo Saltado was a bit over fried and was too hard. As far as service goes, there was only two servers and so service was a bit slow. We ended up having to flag down the server at the end of the meal to get the check.

Overall, I think I'd go to Mr. Pollo if I want a quick bite, especially since they have a really awesome chimchirri sauce that wasn't at Misky Misky. But if you have a large group, then definitely go to Misky Misky as they have a larger dining area.</review>

The food is very good and authentic Peruvian. The ceviche is was the highlight for me. I've also had the saltados and rice dishes, all very good. the service is great and the prices are reasonable for the quality of food. They also offer Peruvian beer and other drinks.< /review>

I had never had Peruvian food and decided to give this place a try after having passed it many times. Checked it out on TA, found very favorable reviews, and off I went on a Thursday evening. It was close to 7:00pm on a weekenight, but 3/4 filled with people enjoying themselves. It is not fancy inside, nor is it plain. The ambience is casual and very friendly. The menu has plenty of choices and many of the dishes come in your choice of fish, chicken or beef. I had a shredded chicken in a delicious sauce over wonderful potatoes...and big mound of very flavorful rice on the side. Yup, potatoes and rice. As many other TA reviewers have noted, it works! The portion was fine; some of the other dishes had very large portions. Bottom line, do not be afraid to try this cuisine if it is new to you. The dishes are like good comfort food, nothing that should in any way scare off a timid palate. You will like it. Everyone I talk to who has gone, does. And the prices are terrific.</Review>

This was the first time my friend and I had visited this restaurant. We both love Peruvian food and the Peruvian restaurant we used to frequent went out of business. So when we found out about this place, we decided to give it a try. We thought they had great service and the food was really good too. We will most definitely return!< /Text>

PERÚ 🇵🇪
Excerpt from Eat the World Los Angeles:
Two things are immediately apparent right when you open the door. The first is on the big board, a list of ceviches that are the pride and joy of the restaurant. The second is an enjoyable atmosphere and energy that can almost make your skin tingle in anticipation when walking in.

Much of the menu and dish descriptions here go out of the way to focus on and promote the products and culture of Perú. You will see "Peruvian" in front of many items you thought you already knew, like passion fruit and corn. One of those distinctly Peruvian corns comes before any meal in the form of cancha (above), a toasted snack that pairs well with just about any drink and really gets the taste buds ready.

The ceviche selected from the big board on this day was ceviche de mango ($18, below), which combines shrimp, mussels, scallops, and squid with the fish of the day in a marinade kissed by aji amarillo. Somehow the chunks of mango hid from the camera, but you can see both hominy and more cancha, as well as a big hunk of sweet potato that almost tastes of pumpkin pie. Those that have had Peruvian ceviches before will recognize the seaweed, which is also imported from Perú and very distinct.< /review>

Excellent authentic Peruvian food at reasonable prices.  The ceviche is ridiculous as well as the lomo saltado.  Convenient location with lots of parking.  Clean interior and bathroom.  Great service.  Family owned.  Must try<//Text>

The rice was absolutely perfect and very tasty 👌
The only 1 star that I deducted was because of portion size. It was a little small for the price I think.
But the quality was very good 👍<//Review>< rating>

Definitely have the ceviche here! It's delicious and is made of good-sized chunks, not tiny diced bits. The grilled octopus appetizer was also very tasty.</text>

Im not what you would call an expert on cuisine from Peru, but the food served at Misky Misky is amazing!  I cannot get enough of their spicy pasta dish and the yucca root appetizer.  In addition, this place has some tasty hot sauces which taste fresh and original.  Finally, their dessert with the Peruvian ice cream is a wonderful way to end a meal.

My respect goes out to the owners and staff of this establishment.  Also their 7 Vidas beer is worth a try.< /review>

Great food, friendly servers, never too busy or crowded.  one server even remembered how I ordered my dish after 1 visit 😮.  Price for lunch combos are reasonable although they recently raised it from $9 to $10. Parking is not an issue here.</review>

<review>The food here was absolutely amazing.

I only tried two dishes while I was here. I had the Seco Combinado, which was amazing. The beef was tender and the flavors were great. Best yet, the rice was absolutely phenomenal. I was in love with it and I would order the rice by itself.

The other dish I tried was the Chaufa de Pollo. I wasn't sold on it at first because I don't normally like fried rice, but I have to say that it exceeded expectations and it was probably the best fried rice I've had.

The interior was fresh, modern, and most importantly clean. The staff was friendly and helpful.

Overall, I definitely recommend this restaurant and I will be back!< /review>< date>

Unlike the Mexican ceviche that is finely minced and cooked in lemon, the Peruvian ceviche is a little like poke. I loved it and strongly recommend it. The other food is good, such as the Lomo Saltado, but you can get that to go for much less at their sister restaurant Mr. Pollo. The service was uneventful, neither great nor bad.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Best Peruvian food this side of town. A little wait, but we'll worth it. Food this good always takes an extra minute and you'll thank them for making it just right. I had the Lomo Saltado, and it was not just good, but it was the best Lomo Saltado I've had, hands down, and I've been to Peru.<//Review>< resp>

<Text>By all means. Don’t judge this great place by its  cover. From the outside it may use a coat of paint but what they are cookin in there is truly a delight with a recipe that shouldn’t change. The seafood soup was amazing alone and as a large family we ordered many different items to taste and it didn’t disappoint. Unique flavors and presentation. Give it a shot.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>There's a lot of great reviews, but I'm extremely skeptical, really doubt the filet mignon on the menu is actually filet mignon. Even it is, there was a lack of tenderness in the meat that it might as well been any other steak. The fries on it sucked as well, they had texture of day old microwaved McDonald's fries.

Besides that it has a good atmosphere, and the chicken on the menu is great.

Avoid the "star" dish lomo saltado.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

< review>
My first time here was a nice experience because I had ordered cheviche to go for my wife but when we got here my wife changed her mind so the host was nice enough to offer for us to sit at the bar. It was a nice gesture on his part.

Tonight my cousin who is visiting from VA wanted to eat Peruvian food so I thought of this place plus I wanted to try a dish I had seen which is a layer of potatoes, layer of avocado a layer of egg and a layer of chicken I think. Anyways I ordered also a glass of purple sangria.  We were left unattended for a really long time.  I think because there was two big party groups that more important to the workers.  So after a really long wait we get our drinks and I wondered since when did purple turn to orange colored.  I asked the lady what happened she oops we will get you the correct drink.  They bring the food except I have no plate in front of me so I waited to see if it was late or what.  I then started to feel they forgot about me... So I asked she goes back there and she come back and states that they messed up on the dish so they could not make it anymore.  I asked what they messed up, she then says if I want anything else.  I told her no.  I got up a little bit later and as I saw all a man that looked like he worked there.  I asked him to not charge us for any of the food I ordered as I didn't get nor did the workers get my drink right.  To please allow my cousin to enjoy her food and that was all.  The guy agreed.

So hit or miss what can I tell you.  Service might be there and it might not be there at all.  Food is great don't get me wrong just be ready to be ignored if they have big parties.< /review>

Came here once after my wife wouldn't stop bugging me to come here for lunch. IM SO GLAD I DID! Great food with explosions of flavor. Our waitress was really friendly and helpful. The service was great. I'm looking forward to my next visit. Hopefully it's soon.</Review>

Honestly, their other store, Mr. Pollo is ten times better. Their ceviche which used to be great tasted frozen, bland, and mushy. We spent $120 and WILL NOT return. I drove all the way from Murrieta, next time I'll drive two more exits to Mr. Pollo< /Text>

Food was great!!! We're never disappointed when it comes to the food. When we got there they were very attentative like always.
Yesterday, though are waitress was hardly around... a few of us needed water to continue our dinner, after about 20 minutes someone came, and thats after we flagged someone down. We weren't happy about the service yesterday but they were busy. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. We will go there again but we'll take a little brake from them for now.<//Text>

Small portion. Tiny little of Salmon Filet & over cooked. Too dried because the Salmon is too thin, not worth for the price. But good services.</text>

Food was great!!! We're never disappointed when it comes to the food. When we got there they were very attentative like always.
Yesterday, though are waitress was hardly around... a few of us needed water to continue our dinner, after about 20 minutes someone came, and thats after we flagged someone down. We weren't happy about the service yesterday but they were busy. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. We will go there again but we'll take a little brake from them for now.<//Text>

I ate here based upon the prior reviews and can verify that all are very “spot on”. The food was very good as was the service. The exterior is unassuming but the product and service inside is quite good. Well above the norm. I had a signature Peruvian dish, Pollo Saltado, and it was delicious and fresh. The most difficult part of the dinner was deciding what to select. The Ceviches looked amazing as did the Pechuga al Chimichurri and Seco Combinado. The desserts were terrific as well and the beer before and coffee after bookended a great meal. I recommend a visit and will return if in the area again.</text>

<Review>The food is ridiculously good here. I was told they're known for their ceviche but I didn't try any because I wasn't that hungry and wanted to pick an entree to eat. Maybe next time! Arroz con Mariscos - holy holy ...this is amazing. If you like seafood and that snugly sleepy feeling you get after eating good home comfort foods, this is for you. From what I could recognize, it had squid, mussels, and shrimp. It's really good. Lomo Saltado - another amazing dish. The taste is just so amazing and flavorful. If you like beef or it's your first time and you want to play it super safe, then pick this one.< /Review></record>

<Text>I've been to Peru before and I know how good Lomo Soltado taste like. So when my girlfriend took me here, I was a little doubtful that it may not measure up to the Lomo Soltado I ate in Peru. The waitress was nice and friendly and immediately show us our table. It wasn't busy when we got there but started to get busy right after we left. Our waitress took the time to explain the dishes and the ceviches. I ordered the Pollo Lomo Soltado and my girlfriend ordered the beef. The preparation of the dish looks different from the Lomo Soltado in Peru ( the French fries were mixed with the dish as opposed to putting it on the side). My first taste told me, Yum!!!! I liked it a lot and I am happy. It brought me back to Peru in my imagination. So, so good!! The tomato and onion was not over-cooked and was quite good. Our waitress was attentive and help us pack our left-over food (the dish was too much for me). The restaurant appeared clean. I will be back here.</Text>< pictures>

<review>The host of this Peruvian restaurant is seldom at the front to help guests. I ordered lomo Saltado worth $16.00. Presentation is good but right after I ate the beef from the surface, the next layer was just veggies, soy sauce and lots of fries.  For $16, there should be more meat than fries.<//review><username>Emma Castillo<//username>< time>

<response>None< /response><text>My wife ranted and raved about this place that they go for lunch sometimes. So I decided to try for dinner. Soon service is sub par is an understatement as it doesn't exist at all. My beverage glass was empty for about 15 minutes before I flagged down someone and asked for a refill. Dinner took almost 45 minutes from the order to serving. And got that wait I was miffed but expected some extraordinary food. All I got was a soupy version of paella with so much salt that makes you drink water all night long and it did not taste like anything. These people should pay attention to their serving staff and the speed of their kitchen first and foremost.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Food is really good, but slightly pricey! Had a ceviche and the beef/frites + 3 types of dessert (large party splitting). Even sampled the pesto pasta and the pollo con cilantro rice. Everything was delicious and seasoned well. Staff was pretty friendly as well. But yeah, almost $20 for what seems to be fajitas, rice and filet mignon seems kinda pricey. To be fair, each of those pieces were cooked very well - for instance onion no longer had bite, but was still crispy and tasty. Filet wasn't dried out and tender.<//text>

Love the food and great service. Price is decent. Maybe just add to the kids menu. I know we can always order from the regular menu but it's too much for a small child. maybe add like a small portion of aroz con pollo for kids. Other than that I love this place.< /text>

The service is poor, the waitress disappeared, the food took a long time to come out. I asked for Chaufa de Mariscos (plural) it tasted smoked, 2 shrimps, some squid, tons of bean sprouts. There are other choices, limited menu, not a place I'm coming back to!</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Misky Misky is a hidden Peruvian restaurant. They serve plenty of ceviche options as well as pastas. The all time favorite dish has to be the Lomo saltado. The Lomo saltado will not disappoint at all. Their portion is enough to leave you full. Don't forget to try the sangria. They also serve 4-5 different types of dessert, including ice cream and a churro swirl. They are all good options. Definitely my favorite Peruvian restaurant and the 40 minute drive will not stop me from coming.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c32901696e0843:0x5d24d408a4b5323b< /Gmap_id></record>

Get the green sauce. I don't know what it's called because I was too busy eating all the delicious food in front of me. And now I regret it because I want that green sauce again.</text>

The food was good but the owner was a dick
Bad attitude
I should of never left a tip

It was our first time there and we didn't know the lingo and asked the waitress what certain words meen and she stumbled like she didn't know wow
And when we got the bill we got charged for a refill or another cup we didn't know so I asked the owner that we didn't know and he said
" Did you read the menu it say in there
You should of read it"
he could of said it another manner but he said it in a dick  way
Then he "said can I have the money"
Another dick way of responding

The food was great but not the Customer service

To bad

I'm not going again sorry

To the owner

<Text>We came to this place because we were visiting friends and I wish the place was closer to San Diego. The food was delish! Lomo Saltado was on point. We also tried the chicken version. We tried tallarines with chicken. I would suggest the chef a mix of both white and dark meat to perfect the recipe. They also had leche asada! Or for us from Guadalajara, Mexico is Jericalla. It was THE BEST I ever had in the US! If you have not tried this is like the french creme brule version. Just to die for!. I didn't give 5 stars because we had to wait a bit for a second and third round of drinks but other than that, I highly recommend this place.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Omg I had a great meal and experience there today with my wife. The food was amazing. We had the Aji de Gallina, Tallarin Verde con Bisteck, Choros a la Chalaca, and Chicharron de Calamar. My wife and I are definitely going back A LOT.</Review><user_name>Anthony G<//user_name></record>

Friendly staff. The Service on weekends can be a little slow. My only complaint are the aluminum chairs. They're very uncomfortable.< /Review><resp>None</resp>< name>

<resp>None< /resp><name>Edward G< /name><Rating>3< /Rating><Text>While this may be one of the few Peruvian food places in the Covina Valley area, it doesn't make it the best , by default.
To be very sincere, if Peruvian is what you crave a drive to Mario's Peruvian on Melrose Blvd in Los Angeles may just be in order. Misky Misky must surely be aware that "saltados" come in different combinations and the seasoning is the key.  Make your own comparison and you will see.  Misky Misky has a lot of potential but they need to check out the competition (even if they are not close) and up their game.< /Text><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

I've been going here for years and they're always consistently delicious. I've practically tried every menu item.
Highly recommend the lomo saltado or their new linguini. The papa la huancaina or ceviche de mango as an appetizer, and any of their desserts.
The ice cream tastes like caramel, but it's actually a fruit!</Text>

<text>Very nice environment, excellent service and tastefully food. If you want to try something new this is the place to be. My favorites dishes are: ceviche mixto, chupe with shrimps, and lomo saltado. And finally, leche quemada is the dessert to order...</text>< Time>

Honestly, I was a little underwhelmed. As far as their Lomo saltado, and their sea food options go I was satisfied but when it came to their papá a la huancaina I had to draw the line, its taste reminded me of nacho cheese and did not taste like authentic peruvian cooking. I didn't get to explore too much of the menu but I would stick to ordering some kind of tallarin next time.</text>

<text>It's alright. The portions are big but very little meat. When I asked for the filet mignon dish that comes with white rice it looked like milanessa filet in tiny pieces. Lots of dishes look like ones you can make at home.< /text>< date>

DON'T GET ANTICUCHOS!
I got there at 9:45 pm, waited 2-3 mins to get seated, 5 mins to order, and another 10 to get my food. I ordered anticuchos, big mistake! They were so hard, I couldn't even chew them. I complaint and the waitress apologized but couldn't get me another plate because they close at 10pm, even though there were still 20 other customers, but offered me a discount. I thought she meant taking it off the bill, but instead she gave me a lousy 10%!< /Review>

Alot of classic peruvian dishes you would expect were not on the menu.  Peruvian food is my favorite  and I always feel satisfied, but not here. Save yourself a trip and find some better peruvian like Don Felix. Will never eat hereally again.</review>

Good flavor as a Peruvian. Love the Ceviche Crocante, my hubby loves the Lomo Saltado , Anticucho could be better cut( nerve tissue). Besides that the ambience and service very pleasant.</review>

<Text>Out of town on business for a week and so glad I tried this place.  So good I ate it at least once a day.  The Lomo Saltado is awesome!  Super friendly staff, great drinks, awesome service.  My co-worker said he will be coming back anytime he is in the LA area.  UPDATE.  Stayed in Covina on business again.  Ate here all week.  Tried the Cau Cau de Mariscos and it was so good I had it 3 nights in a row.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>First of all: not because a place has a big shinning, and the cooking staff wearing black chef outfits, makes for good eating. How many times, I, myself, have prepared a delicious meal at home, only to put forth a series of blunders in subsequent attempts? Too many to count, that is for sure, because excellent cooking is a rarity, not the norm.
Misky Misky presently enjoys 4 solid stars in Yelp, which for better or for worst, is the site many good people utilized to determine where they may want to go eat. They charged a pretty penny for their dishes, and even though there are many things to admire of their location, the food, I am here to tell, is definitely their strong suit. To be frank, is an affront to the truly wonderful Peruvian Cuisine, and I will go one step further by saying that Peruvian food in USA, is a series of missteps, and below part effort. Uneven, expensively disappointing, and a bad example of the real deal. How do I voice such a harsh opinion? I have spent hundreds, more like thousands of dollars, eating at countless so called Peruvian establishments, and if by luck I ate very well at one or the other, the next time the experience plummeted to mediocre. Misky Misky is not all that good. Plates:
Ají de Gallina, $9 (lunch time special): a creamy sauce made with yellow Peruvian Chili with shredded chicken, served with rice-the do give you a significant mound of decent white rice, if only white rice was the main dish, they would probably deserve their fake 4 stars rating-and potatoes, boil egg, and black seeded olive. In Peru, a masterpiece in every way, In West Covina average at best. 3 Stars.
Papa a la Huancaina, $8. Potatoes served with a velvety sauce, really delicious. Garnished with olives and boil egg. Misky version a disaster in texture, flavor, and value. 2 Stars.
Pollo a la Anticuchera, $10. A flat, thin piece of chicken, dried beyond redemption, like a shoe sole I would compare it to, with salad and the mound of rice. Good job, Chefs! Thanks for water to be able to swallow this concoction. 1 Star.
Cau Cau de Mariscos, $15. Let's just say that the seafood part was overshadowed by the overwhelming amount of potatoes. Sauce runny and devoid of any taste. Rice better than the rest. $15 frigging dollars?! 1 Star.
Fried Calamari, $12? Heavy on the oil, excessive breading. We are not in the right place for a delicate dish such as this one. 1.5 Star.
Ceviche Mixto, $16. The signature dish of Peru. This version very small, but must admit it was good. The mixed seafood tasted fine. 4 Stars.
Water with very little after taste, service indifferent and turtle like slow. Yes, we drove 50+ miles, weather the LA traffic for this? Peruvian food anyone? Planes will take you to the Mecca, but here a series of misfortunes by being at the mercy of incompetent talentless cooks. No Chefs worth their money to be found so far, I don't care how many glowing reviews, do not believe the hype! $80 plus for a meal better prepared at home, for a fraction of the cost. 2 Stars.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Awesome  arroz con pollo and drinks. didn't  like the Causa. They tried to americanise it and it was a waste  of money and horrible  taste. The rest of the  menu had a great Peruvian  taste. The ceviche was worth the trip.</Text>

El lomo saltado,sin sabor, prefiero el tamaño y precio de Mr Pollo, aunque sean los mismos dueños, obvio que no son los mismos cocineros. Buena suerte. Yo, no regreso ni refiero a alguien.</text><Date>1422757815186</Date><UserId.>116403674693608714788< /UserId.>< Name>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I like the food but it is necessary that in their dishes they also give the option of the banana, I do not mean the banana. And the place lacks televisions and Creole music.

<review>(Translated by Google) Very high prices for homemade food, I ordered rice with seafood and only had 3 shrimp and an octopus. I do not recommend it, they want to appear to be a great restaurant, but it is far from it.

(Translated by Google) Yesterday I had lunch with my wife, she asked for a Aguadito de Mariscos and when I started eating I found 2 hairs, I claim and the owner of name Julio, said that my wife put the hairs in the aguadito. Later he asked for fried fish with rice, the fish tasted very strange (it seemed bad) and the rice was badly cooked (masacote). Really a depeccion.

(Original)
Ayer fui almorzar con mi esposa, ella pidio un Aguadito de Mariscos y al empezar a comer encontro 2 pelos, reclamo y el dueño de nombre Julio, dijo que mi esposa puso los pelos en el aguadito. Posteriormente pidio pescado frito con arroz, el pescado tenia un sabor bien raro (parecia malogrado) y el arroz estaba mal cocido (masacote). Realmente una depeccion.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Very expensive and very poor service I was wrong in the tip I think, and they went to claim me the first time they do that to me, last time I go because they get angry if you forget the tip .....
