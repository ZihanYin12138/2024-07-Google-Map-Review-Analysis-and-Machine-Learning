<review>Sean provided an amazing customer service. He went above and beyond helping me with me with my new phone.  Not only did Sean provide an excellent customer experience but is also extremely knowledgeable with Sprints products. His partner Stephanie was also great!

If I could give this young man 10 stars, I would!< /review>< pictures>

San Fernando Sprint Store is the BOOM.  From the consultants  Sean and Jocelyn to the Manage Cynthia. They were all very helpful and friendly. Very HAPPY with the service they  provided.  The General Manager got there while they where helping me with my new line and he was very friendly with us(customers) employees.</text>

I needed my iPhone 6 battery, which was dead, and they replaced it for the fair price of $40. I did not need to make an appointment and they were able to replace it within the same day. It's been a few months since my battery was replaced and my phone is working just fine.<//text>

Walked into the Sprint store in San Fernando for an upgrade and was greated right away. Joe was very helpful and even made me aware of all the deals my account was eligible for. I walked away with an upgrade (galaxy s10) plus and iPad for the same price that I was already paying. Overall great experience.< /text>

I came to this sprint store due to my phone having had an accident and had the employees help me. They offered me a good deal on an upgrade and took care of me from beginning to end. I walked out very happy and grateful that they were patient even when I had 100 different questions. Will definitely come back!<//Text>

Sprint is by far the worst company to get a phone with. My iPhone has speaker issues. And when I call they send out a refurbished phone. I receive it and the same problem. When I ask for a new one , they say to go into the store. At the store they say sorry we can not help you. Call customer service again. And the same BS again. I should of stayed with T-Mobile. My brother recently got the iPhone 7 free with a replacement at no charge. NEVER USE SPRINT AS A PHONE CARRIER< /review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>My iPhone 6 met an untimely death after I left it on the hood of my car. Needless to say, Cynthia went above and beyond getting not only myself, but also my husband, new phones. Fortunately, both our phones were already due for an upgrade. She was patient with my nerves regarding such a large purchase, explaining each cost to me. She made sure there were no hidden fees, and made sure that we got a deal.
The only issue I had was actually with the regional manager who happened to be there at the time, Paul. He was rather rude to the store manager. We could overhear them in the back. He was also kinda rude to the customers, not bothering to say hello or anything. It was as if he didn't care that customers were in the store.< /Text>< pics>

Make sure you take your patience while I was there yesterday the customer before me was called to pick up his phone and they could not find it. They tell him are you sure we called you. Now to me after a while of waiting I wanted to see if they could update to jellybean for my s3 the girl gets my phone to the settings and does what I all ready had done and tells me there is no updates.  I tell her it did that but I read it could bring to store to do the update.  She answered what is jellybean another agent tells her is a update take it to the back they do it. She comes back 5 min later and tells me we don't have it. I have been there 4 times and only 1 time they have solved my problem I'm done with this place.</text>

< Review>
I bought an iPad mini 4 from Edwin Galicia and was told a lot of lies. He said I was going to pay less but found out he made a new account with my iPad only. Edwin moved to Granada Hills store and still couldn't fix my problem. Now his in San Fernando and he wouldn't fix it at all. I found Tony from Van Nuys and he helped me try to fix the issue. I went to find Tony at Sherman Oaks and he attempted to fix the issue in his store. Very bad service from Edwin.</Review>

My experience was the best customer service Ive had in a long time! Richard, Stephanie, Katia, Ilyas were amazing and were very knowledgable and nice.  If I were hiring for my compay. I would hire them on the spot!  They all deserve raises!!! I am recommending all my clients to shop at the San Fernando store.</review>

I pre-ordered the iPhone 7 plus here on Monday and they told me it will be here today ready for pick up. They called me this morning and told me the phone was ready, so I go in to pick it up and once I get there they tell me my phone won't be ready for another month and they claimed to never call me saying that the phone was ready and completely wasted my time. Very unprofessional. I will never do business here again.<//text>

My order was delivered in excellent packaging - colors bright and clearly great, solid quality box.  They were the perfect texture and not crumbly or dry.  The flavors popped and didn't taste synthetic or leave a coating in our mouths.  They lasted for several days and still tasted fresh. Worth it and will definitely order again.< /Text>

<Text>Whoops! Macaroons Ontario made my wedding even more special. I can’t express how happy I am with their product, customer service and overall experience. Lauren helped me design and create the perfect wedding party favor for our destination event. Not only were the macaroons delicious, but the presentation including the custom picture was simply Devine. They are great for everyday occasions like a birthday, thank you, or even when your husband messes up and needs to get back on your good graces. We totally recommend.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I discovered Woops about a year ago! They are literally my "go-to" spot for macaroons in the IE! The owner, Lauren, is so kind and her staff are always friendly and have great customer service every time I go. I've purchased many different flavors but my favorites so far have been the lavender, rose and pistachio flavors. (I'm getting happy just thinking about the taste!) Whenever you're at the Ontario Mills Mall, swing by their kiosk for a tasty snack to enjoy while you shop or to take home for later. I've even purchased some a gifts for colleagues who really enjoyed them. I also love that you buy different size boxes, based on your budget and craving!< /Text></record>

<Text>Absolute perfection! Woops Macarons at Ontario Mills were able to customize my Engagement Macarons! They were honestly breathtaking and the display was so elegant! The flavors are unique and amazing, each macaron is individually wrapped and in perfect condition upon arrival. The packaging and unique touch is a step above.  Such a great gift for a birthday or a special event. I think I have found my new addiction!<//Text>< pics>

Ive purchased macaroons and the marshmallow treats as gifts here and they are always amazing! The macaroons are my fave, the strawberry and raspberry! They are a bigger size than i've seen at other shops and the perfect macaroon texture! Would absolutely recommend and will be stopping by to pick some up as holiday gifts!< /Text>

<Review>Honestly these Macaroons are bomb. Com!!! I suck at giving gifts but bam! Who doesn’t love receiving desserts as a gift!? I do! They’re always a hit. I’m definitely picking up for the holidays, birthdays, and just for my comfort. 10/10 in everything. I need to stop writing before I dream about these macaroons.

All of their macaroons are also true to their flavors which is the best part. There are so many other locations where all the macaroons taste exactly the same.

Our family loves Sweet treats & all types of delicious Deserts!  To say the least we are ultra critical and have our favorites. These Macarons by woops are so delicious and tasty with every bite they
are moist and just the right amount of sweetness We highly recommend trying every flavor as they will not disappoint. My daughters love every flavor we have tried they don’t discriminate haha. Seriously my go to for special events or party gatherings.</Review>

<review>Woops is one of my favorite shops. It might sound dramatic for me to say that these macaroons are the greatest thing I’ve ever put into my mouth, but I am not kidding. I recommend also trying their pre-packaged waffles (they’re a personal favorite).

Simply the best macarons I’ve ever had ! These macs are so cute and tasty. They’ve made great gifts for family and provide for a nice photo op too. I’ve even ordered the Macaron pyramid for a special occasion and it was total hit ! Definitely recommend, might even consider their event cart for a future event. Overall, great customer service, tasty treats, and very photo friendly. Thanks Woops !<//text>

I am in love with the Woops Macarons. I recently got some and the staff was very friendly, helpful and all wearing wearing Masks.  They are fresh and the filling melts in your mouth.

Lauren was very helpful in the design process for my daughters birthday macaron pyramid (she was very patient with my indecisive 8 year old daughter lol). They delivered the pyramidA to our house the day of the birthday and even added beautiful flowers to the pyramids. My daughter felt so special that day.
In terms of flavor, they were all on point. Texture was soft and practically melts in your mouth. The colors were bright and vibrant which is hard to find with macarons. We choose: rose, honey lavender, strawberry, birthday cake, blueberry cheesecake, pistachio, coconut, vanilla & salted Carmel. Our guests loved every flavor chosen!
This is a must when visiting the Mills or looking for a unique catering company!< /review><Resp>{'time': 1602010632031, 'text': 'Same, we were honored that you chose Woops! for your daughters birthday celebration.

After I visited here for the first time, I thought to myself: “Woops! I should have bought 20 more.”

These macarons are just phenomenal!

Have not had the pleasure of tasting such a delightful macaron since I traveled to France 5 years ago. The people at Woops! seem to know something about making delicious Macarons that no-one else does. That is to say, the quality of these macaroons is top-tier.

The staff are simply wonderful people, I was greeted by a warm environment and felt totally comfortable throughout my time in the store.

Be sure to visit! I’ll certainly be back!</Review>

These are AMAZING! Ok so, macarons are my favorite cookie and my aunt only makes them once a year....so any opportunity I have to try a macaron at a bakery or restaurant, I always try at least one, but usually I'm disappointed. Not so with Woops! She has such a light hand and her flavor game is on point! My boyfriend surprised me with a box a couple of weeks ago and I have been obsessed with them ever since. Dark chocolate and strawberry are to DIE for!<//Text>

I always buy Macarons anytime I’m out and see them somewhere. I’m usually disappointed. These are the best I’ve found so far. The centers are so smooth and creamy. That’s what make the difference from others.<//text>

The best in the area! You will NOT find macarons this good anywhere close. I didn’t get to try any of their other deserts but if they’re half as good as the macarons, I highly recommend them.< /Review>

< Review>
The fence was almost great if only they had used one of there redwood 2x4's to connect my pool fence to the new fence instead of the painted one I had laying behind my shed (see picture).

I  also really enjoy picking up other peoples cigarette butts and having to fish rusty nails out of my swimming pool (thanks for the stains).

UPDATE:
After a phone call they came out and replaced the board to match the rest of the fence. Changing to 3 stars.</Review>

Ivan, Salvador and Jose were all great to work with. Salvador was always easy to contact during the estimate process and his proposal even included an aerial view and 3D models of the fences to be installed. Once the project began, Ivan did a great job coordinating, scheduling and informing me of the steps needed to proceed. The craftsmanship of Jose and his team was awesome and the project was completed within the estimated time.

The main thing I love about Ergeon is their constant communication and updates. You always get the sense that they are on top of things and you never feel neglected or ignored.

Ergeon's estimate came out close to another well reviewed competitor but in the end, the great communication was what sealed the deal.

I highly recommend Ergeon for a stress free experience and excellent and well built fences.< /Text>

<Text>We obtained several quotes for a new fence and not only was Ergeon a great value, it had one of the most aesthetically pleasing designs. The team has also been incredibly responsive and helpful with any issue identified. Many of our neighbors have asked who we used! Highly recommend.</Text>< rating>

Shortly after having my fence installed (by Ergeon) I went back to Ergeon for some follow-up work. I wanted my fence stained/sealed (and I didn’t want to do it myself). Andrea L. returned my call quickly and helped me pick out the color I was looking for and walked me through what to expect when it came to getting the job done. Best parts of this all – Did it from my phone, quickly and painlessly; and – the price was great! I really didn’t expect anything less than great service, and Andrea L. didn’t let me down. Thanks Andrea L!<//text>

<review>I knew this company was something special when they communicated so well with me throughout whole entire process. I was able to provide my ideas, they gave me a call and used Google Meets to provide a visual of the current fence that we needed to replace. I gave them my preference of the style of fencing I wanted and they built it exactly how I wanted it in exactly a day. They worked the entire day from 8am to 8pm to get the job done and the outcome was amazing!!<//review>< UserId.>

<Review>Ergeon Fences was very easy to work with, and I appreciated the “virtual estimate”.  Troy Downs was very responsive, friendly, and professional. He was also very knowledgeable and answered all of my questions. I can sum everything up with “outstanding customer service”! Thank you.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Nils lied about being good to go on the financing side. Dishonest salesman who just said what he needed to do he could get the job. No flexibility when they promised certain financing and said I was good to go. After they switched it up and said I wasn’t qualified but they finished the install. What a joke< /review>

This review is only for the free quoting process (thus far).  I submitted an online request for a quote and was responded to quickly.  My contact, Kelly, arranged for me to start off with her on a virtual visit using Google Meet to go over the work I was looking to do.  We walked around the property for a better understanding of what is currently there and any obstacles that might come up.  Kelly answered my questions, and arranged a 2nd call a couple of days later due to some poor reception we were having.

During the calls, I explained that I have some grand ideas of changing the whole look of the fence rather than a simple replacement.  Given that my surrounding neighbors may not be in favor of my unique design ideas, Kelly provided me several different quotes (broken down by line items of the tasks at hand) to give us options to consider.  The quotes included a few computer renderings of the proposed ideas to help visualize the concepts being discussed and to ensure that we were on the same page.

Once the preliminary quotes were provided, Kelly also sent text messages to ensure I got the email, and answered some more questions I had.  I asked a couple more questions and she was able to provide some example photos of other similar jobs for further clarity.

All in all, Kelly and Ergeon have been very professional, timely, and accommodating...and this is only for the preliminary quoting phase.  While I am waiting for some other quotes for comparison, the quotes provided all seem to be within reason, and Ergeon will be strongly considered for the job.</Text>

<text>I am working with Ergeon Fencing to replace a fence that touches
2  other properties. There are 3 Homeowners who have to agree,
that in itself  is stressful but Ergeon saved the day. The proposal and estimates that were provided were detailed  and gave options and suggestions. Working with Kelly made it very easy , quick responses
and excellent follow thru. Customer Service is excellent, I would highly
recommend this company< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Hired this company to replace a fence along the back of my property, the workers showed up on time and put in my beautiful fence in no time! The company is great at follow up and making the customer happy! I have already recommended Eregeon to friends and will continue to do so.< /review>

<Response>{'time': 1616193637024, 'text': 'Thank you Rod! I will be sure to pass along your feedback to Sergio!'}< /Response><Text>Worked with Sergio in getting a quote for my fence that blew down in January. It is March so I am in no hurry but would like to get it done the way I like it. Requested quotes from 2 other contractors but Sergio was the most patient. I went from changing heights to different lengths and Sergio was glad to change it for me. After he changed the quote about 3 times having to do the work of sending me new quotes time after time he was still gracious and was still willing to call after I told him I was going with another contractor.
Well after I did deeper research on the other guy I found that he was an unlicensed contractor which is obviously a deal breaker for me. So I called Sergio back and I will be going with Ergeon. The other contractor that I mentioned didn't have a guy available to quote me until April.<//Text>< Pics>

Mark and the team at Ergeon did an excellent job understanding my requirements for the gate and fence replacement. They assessed the job and provided me with a quote and design quickly. They were very professional and I am pleased with their services! Peter</Review>

I was very impressed with the quote process.  The computer generated renderings gave detailed measurements and prices for each section.  Their customer service is stellar from the sales rep to the project manager to the installer. Installation was slow to book but could it   be a sign of the times.  I would definitely use them again.  They did a terrific job with our fence and gate.<//Text>

<Review>Andrea was an absolute gem to deal with in planning my communal fence with my neighbor. She was so nice and helpful. I must have asked a million questions and there was a lot of back and forth emails but every communication I had with her was nothing but professional, patient, and informative. She helped me immensely in planning and coordinating a new fence build of which I had no prior knowledge or experience with. After our dealings I’m actually pretty educated on wood fencing! Thanks Andrea!< /Review><Time>1613504645879<//Time>< user_id>

<review>Our area experienced some vicious storms early last week, destroying multiple sections of fencing.  Ergeon was extremely quick to return our calls and put estimates together for us.  We look forward to working with them again, as they did an amazing job on a driveway expansions for us back in November.  Many thanks to Kelly for scheduling a video call with us to review the damage and for promptly answering our questions!

Ergeon, and the representative I've talked to Kelly, has been great to work with so far. They've been very easy set up a remote video appointment and go over in detail all concrete work I've liked to get done. They have been responsive to updates and revising quotes and have competitive prices. I would certainly recommend working with Ergeon.<//Text>

The rep was very professional. I did not use the company because my back yard neighbors brother-in-law is a landscaper and wanted the bid and went way under all the others. I would recommend them for your fence needs.< /text>

Our experience with Kelly at Ergeon has been very helpful and patient. We had a fence fall down in a recent storm, and decided to utilize their concrete work as well. She has helped us with a virtual quote, and has been available around our working hours to start the job. We are looking forward to the finished product.< /Text>

<review>My wife and I have been looking for a trusted company to help us with our landscaping.  What made us decide to go with Ergeon has been the service so far through their use of technology and clear detailed breakdowns of what the estimate is.  I would recommend them thus far.  And I’ll write a follow up review of the work and post before and after photos.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Our fence that Ergeon built on one side of our yard two years ago (spring 2019) is strong and looks great. It survived last week's hellacious windstorm and now that it is time to put up a new fence on the other side of the yard, we are going with Ergeon's solid construction. Kelly worked with us two years ago and was able to quickly get the job done. This time, she had us do a 5-minute video meeting to look at our yard and new fence needs and we will soon have our fence up and will be set fence-wise for the next 30 years.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1613408270472, 'text': 'Thank you Lyle!

<text>We had a great experience working with Nils.  We were able to do a video estimate, for a fence, which saved us a lot of time. We received back a comprehensive document including photos, and all the options we had talked about were written out separately with their prices, which was very helpful for us.  Nils answered our questions over txt within a few minutes and was always helpful.
The only reason we didn't choose Ergeon, in the end, was we decided to go with a friend of the family.< /text>< Pics>

The fence around my home was falling in several spots and needed to be completely replaced.  I went to home advisor to do some research and obtain 3 proposals. The Ergeon quote was extremely competitive, but what stood above the rest was the detailed specs on their quote.  They used satellite images to clearly illustrate the scope of work, and broke down the segments of the fence, so I could easily share the information (height, style, cost) with my neighbors.  Magdalena, our dedicated project manager, took the time to clearly explain to me the stages within the project.  She even worked with me on a few change orders (new gate and additional tree stump removal).  The professionalism and attention to detail was clearly evident from day one. Gonzalo, our lead contractor, was equally amazing.  His team showed up on-time everyday, stayed late, and even worked a weekend to ensure he met his deliverables. I would highly recommend Ergeon to my friends and family!<//Review>

Highly recommend Ergeon and their crew! From receiving a quote to the day the cement was installed they were phenomenal! They were in constant communications with me through phone calls, emails and text messages. They asked if I wanted anything specific with the installation and they fulfilled it. After they finished they answered all my questions on how to maintain it and they cleaned all around the work site. I was so impressed on how hard and fast they worked. They showed up on time and did what they said they were going to do. I will definitely use them again next year for another project.< /review>

Ergeon did a great job building a wood fence in my house. From the first contact with Andrea you can tell that they are customer service oriented. Never pushy, but always attentive.
Very knowledgeable, and accommodating, they are a great team, and very reasonable prices.</Review>

The entire process was very convenient and easy, especially given covid restrictions on travel.  I asked for a quote on my fence and a couple of gates and was immediately contacted by Kelly.  The process was very convenient and easy.  I am very happy with the great consistent communication throughout the process and I look forward to working with Ergeon during the rest of the process and during future projects!<//Review>

My experience with Ergeon was a mixed bag. They provided an excellent experience while providing a quote - explaining each item and answering all questions. I also had an excellent project manager who was extremely responsive. On the day of my installation, things were not the best - there were delays and an unexpectedly long execution time, and the final product was not to my satisfaction. However, Ergeon came and addressed each of the issues and completed the task to my satisfaction, apologizing repeatedly for the delays and inconvenience. The end result is great and I am happy with my new fence!</review>

<Text>Ergeon did an excellent job redoing my patio! Mike guided me through the paver choice in style and color, and really helped me make a choice that fit my small patio. Magdalena was a great project manager, she even helped me with the HOA approval process. The crew worked hard, was polite and I am very happy with the end result which was also ahead of schedule and on budget.

Photos attached are Before/After, pretty good eh?< /Text>< pics>

<review>The fence around my home was falling in several spots and needed to be completely replaced.  I went to home advisor to do some research and obtain 3 proposals. The Ergeon quote was extremely competitive, but what stood above the rest was the detailed specs on their quote.  They used satellite images to clearly illustrate the scope of work, and broke down the segments of the fence, so I could easily share the information (height, style, cost) with my neighbors.  Magdalena, our dedicated project manager, took the time to clearly explain to me the stages within the project.  She even worked with me on a few change orders (new gate and additional tree stump removal).  The professionalism and attention to detail was clearly evident from day one. Gonzalo, our lead contractor, was equally amazing.  His team showed up on-time everyday, stayed late, and even worked a weekend to ensure he met his deliverables. I would highly recommend Ergeon to my friends and family!<//review><Gmap_id>0x808fbbcd309c2f81:0x571605dc2e407b2e<//Gmap_id><Resp>{'time': 1603730232096, 'text': 'Thanks Gus!

It is always pleasing when a contractor responds truly professionally, is punctual, and shows flexibility that is so important while dealing with multi-neighbor projects.
Kelly from Ergeon was all that!  In addition she was very careful given the CV-19 restrictions.

Project has started well, thanks to Kelly!  Hope the execution exceeds the expectations!< /text>

Wow!! Ergeon has truly done a phenomenal job.if I could give more stars I would. Everyone was very professional, honest and helpful. Ken, Madeline and the crew were absolutely fantastic. My quote was prompt and extremely competitive. The job was done way ahead of schedule. I have 2 young children and two dogs. Our fence had been in horrible shape for way to long. Ergeon has transformed our backyard and I feel safe knowing my family has a beautiful and secure fence now. I would highly recommend Ergeon to anyone needed a new fence or custom project. Thank you so much Ergeon!!< /review>

I was in the market to replace an 18 yr old fence that had taken a couple falls over a couple winters and it was beyond time for a new one. After searching for about a week or so I got a couple quotes and out of three that I called,Ergeon was by far the best. The sales department was great and got a quote via a video chat, from there I received an emailed quote with everything outlined. Scheduling with the project manager was so easy and if I had any questions she was beyond willing to talk me through it. The crew that came out were professional, courteous, prompt and very skilled. A 61 linear foot fence only took a couple hours. I am amazed and so very happy. If you need a fence here Ergeon, you won’t be disappointed.<//review>

I hired Ergeon for a fairly large project. My job included five sections of fence, two medium gates, one large 10' gate and over 1000 sqft of concrete and another 1000 sqft of stamped concrete.

Overall I'm quite satisfied with their work. My initial phone conversations were informative and helped me to plan properly. They were quick to come up with a quote, and were willing to make changes as I changed my mind few times about designs and materials. Soon after I was assigned a project manager who worked with me til the very end. Right after we finalized the project, a foreman made an in-person visit and went over the details with me.

I liked how thorough they were while preparing the ground for concrete works. Not cutting any corners and several people worked long hours to make sure everything was done the right way. A big crew showed up on the day they were pouring concrete and the execution was pretty flawless. The gates were built from the scratch, not just slapping together some pieces of wood. They look good, feel sturdy and show good workmanship. They welded the 10' long gate hinges to the metal post (as opposed to drilling holes to screw them in), which I very much appreciated. While they were doing the job I had few smaller tasks such as running pipes from downspouts inside the property to the street under the concrete and they happily accommodated my needs. I'll highly recommend this company. Also my project manager Eduardo Barrera was very patient and helpful, he was the interface between me and the people doing the work and he did a great job to ensure that everything was done properly. I'll definitely hire them again for my future concrete or fence works.<//text>

<review>I'd give them 6 stars if I could. The different teams that I worked with were all 100% pro, called on time, followed up when needed and explained every step of the process along the way... my new fence looks great and thought that the price was more than fair. If you need a fence, these are the people that will get it done.</review>< Response>

<Text>I needed to replace a 50 foot section of fence and took my time receiving quotes from a few different companies.  Ergeon was the first company I contacted and ultimately won the job even though they were not the lowest bid.  I worked with a few different reps at Ergeon over the course of a few months while I did my research and each rep had amazing customer service.  Everyone from the reps to the crew who came out to replace the fence were extremely professional.  The entire process was a good one.  Ergeon was transparent and offered the best materials and warranty over any other quote we received.<//Text>< pics>

<userid>106361317385970102766< /userid><review>Great Job!  From Start to finish!

When I was getting quotes from Ergeon as well as other local fencing companies, I was impressed with Penelope's customer service and Ergeon's website that had much more details on the various options available.  Even how far the fence posts were put into the ground!  Penelope provided me with many quotes on the various options which was very helpful.  They had a price range from the very simple "Good Neighbor fence" (which is what I chose) all the way up to the fancy fences with a kick board on the bottom and lattice work on the top!  The prices were either comparable or less than the competitors.

Once I agreed to go with Ergeon, I completed an easy online agreement form (from my phone).  And was then contacted by Magdelena, who was also very responsive with great customer service.  She helped to schedule the work and confirm that everything was done to my satisfaction before payment was made after the work was completed.

When Roy and his team came out to do the fence replacement, they were very courteous.  It was raining that day and they were concerned about tracking mud on our backyard lawn, so they removed a few boards from another fence so they could bring in their tools and wood for the new fence through it without crossing the lawn.  They let me film them and take pictures as I wanted to learn from them as well.  It was a 45 foot section of fence that they replaced.  They started around 9am and were done before 1pm!

They were very professional at replacing the fence with no corrections that needed to be addressed when I inspected the work.  They also did a good job at removing the old fence and cleaning up as well.

I would highly recommend Ergeon to anyone else looking for some fence work.</review>< gmapID>

My driveway was crumbling! I found Ergeon on Angie's list and because they had excellent reviews I contacted them and they sent me quotes and were very professional. However, due  to unfortunate family circumstances I wasn't quite ready to start the project. Magdalena kept in touch with me over the next couple of years just to check in and see how I was doing on a personal level. No pressure! When I was ready to start the project this year I called her and she was so sweet. We got the ball rolling and within a couple of weeks from start to finish the driveway was done and done beautifully. I recommend this company as they were professional, organized, and very trustworthy.  My driveway is no longer a sink hole! Thanks to everyone at Ergeon.<//Review>

From our first contact, Ergeon was very professional. Magdalena gave us every confidence that we would be well taken care of. She worked with us on our quote and was very patient as we asked questions and changed our choices up to better fit the project into our budget.

Francisco was the lead on all the work. He gave great suggestions for texture and colors that wouldn't add too much to the price and would look great. His team worked incredibly hard, and the work is beautiful. At the end, we had a few issues that needed fixing. We contacted Magdalena, and Francisco was back out and fixed everything to our satisfaction. They are very conscientious about making the customer happy. We would absolutely contact them again for another project if we ever have need.</Review>

Ergeon did an amazing job.  They responded quickly to any inquiries, kept us  informed throughout the entire process, and did exactly what they said they would do.

The fence and the driveway gate were far above our expectations.  The neighbors wanted the contact information which we happily provided.

Thank you Ergeon for a Job Well Done!!</Text>

My whole process with Ergeon was nearly seamless. Deciding the details of what I wanted was a little bumpy but they persisted in getting clarification. We needed some tweaking at the end, but they did that cheerfully. It was a 70 foot long, 4 foot high fence with a 3 foot gate. They also built and installed an 8 foot wide double gate in another location. Initially, they put the latch on the wrong side but came back promptly to relocate the latch. Communication was excellent.< /Text>

Their worker promised to remove everything that my tenant used to hold the old fence together but they still leave many pieces of woods there. I confirmed with the worker 3 timed when I signed the acceptance before I left and point at them precisely but they still left these junk woods there.
I email the PM to ask them kindly remove those junk woods but they said they would charge more.
Fortunately the owner Mike reached out to solve the problem. I highly recommend to talk to Mike if you encountered issues.<//review>

<Text>We evaluated 3 bids for our backyard concrete, drainage pipe replacement, and front driveway. Ergeon's bid was very competitive and the most professional...detailing each portion of the job. Their estimator showed up when promised to walk down the job, and we got the bid within a couple days. Our questions were answered promptly. They assigned a professional, Magdalena in our case, to be our point of contact for any questions regarding scheduling, sequencing...anything. And she checked in with us regularly to ensure our satisfaction with the project. Their onsite guys were courteous, worked diligently, and left things in order at the end of each day. Their foreman, Omar, checked progress regularly and did the final inspection with us at the end. We are pleased with the final work product. And the cost came in less than they estimated due to some drain pipe not needing to be replace. Great job!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1575297213966, 'text': "We're happy to have helped you with your driveway project Gary!

< Review>
I have been working with Diana at Ergeon Fence & Driveways for the fence project for our place. She is INCREDIBLE - All along she has been very patiently working with me (especially since I had to change the quote a number of times to accommodate circumstances beyond my control - neighbors unwilling to share cost of the common fence !) - She worked with me very diligently throughout all of the changes answering all the different permutations/combinations I was trying out wrt the fences. She would promptly send over the revised quotes and review necessary changes not missing out on any details - In addition she would help out by sending me fence pictures to help with the various options I could use - she would work out the best pricing for our needs - Put simply she was very efficient, very professional, and thoroughly well equipped to handle all of our concerns and questions. Despite the changes (and I had quite a few) she maintained perfect customer service from her end. What impressed me most about Diana was her willingness to go beyond her call for duty to even check on the fence requirements in our neighborhood and give us advice on various options for us - she went out of her way to draft a letter for the city council for fence permission.

It has been a very long while since I have received such a high level of customer service ! If I ever had a company to run I would hire her in a heartbeat - she really is the best.

Thank you very much Diana and I look forward to working with you on this project. Your sincerity towards your work is truly remarkable.< /Review>

Fence install was crazy fast. One day! The fence looks good and pricing was reasonably. The billing department worked with me and my neighbor to make that part of it easier since we don't have the best working relationship.< /review>

I mentioned in my feedback to Magdalena that the standard latch they installed with the gate was somewhat lackluster and that I would've upgraded to something nicer if I had known there were latch/lock options, and she offered to send somewhat out this week to install a better latch.

The lost art of customer service has been found with Ergeon.  My fence fell down due to the recent storms, so obviously, they were busy.  They managed my expectations around timeframes, then beat those expectations.  Communication throughout was amazing.  Oh, and the fence looks great!  Done in one day.  I would recommend them, and would use them again, although I hope I won't have to soon...< /text>

< Review>
Our backyard fence was old and rickety, and radical tree-cutting by the neighbor suddenly replaced our green leafy private space into a full view of all neighbor's windows and a moonscape yard next door. We wanted to replace this wire fencing (and its deteriorated wooden posts) with a horizontal redwood fence to regain some privacy and put something nice in the back view.

We hired Ergeon to build a new fence, and while the project didn't go as planned, sometimes that's when you find out what a business is really like. Ultimately we found that Ergeon was great to work with and went above and beyond to make sure we got an excellent final product.

The initial communication with our project manager Carmen sold us on Ergeon. Carmen was very responsive, and really knew a lot about their products and fences in general. Our interaction with Carmen initially had us sold because there are a lot of fence companies but many didn’t call us back and one showed up a week late to give an estimate. Their pricing was competitive or slightly lower than all the bids we received.

Ergeon also uses technology to make the whole process easier. They used satellite technology to help get an accurate measurement for the fence. They used an app that allowed us to talk by phone and screen share the information, they had modern detailed estimates delivered via text and email making it easy to pay and initiate the work. But also we could just call or email with a question.

The subcontractor who came in to remove the old fence and build a new one was fantastic. He asked questions to verify what we wanted for the structure, and then calmly built a really solid redwood fence. This wasn't simple because we live on a fairly steep hill, so a lot of boards had to be custom cut for the bottom row.

The problems came with the subcontractor who stained the new fence. They rolled on multiple coats of the wrong stain, leaving a wet-looking, too-dark fence with sticky black globs of residue hanging underneath many of the slats.

We thought maybe it would look better "when it dries" but it stayed glossy and wet-looking.

This is where Ergeon stepped up and really impressed us. We sent pictures a few days later saying "yuck" and they took one look, and replied "This is not up to our standards, and we'll fix it."

Because you can't fix stain, and we didn't want a painted fence (losing the beautiful redwood grain that was a main point of choosing this fence in the first place) — ultimately they sent the builder back out to remove and replace all the slats, i.e. basically they replaced the whole fence.

Not only that, but they upgraded the cut of redwood from what we had chosen to a higher grade.

And last, they sent a different crew to spray on the correct type of stain. All of that went very smoothly.

The amazing thing is how positive to work with Ergeon was about all this. Nine times out of ten, as you know, getting mistakes fixed with any business is a big painful negotiation if they're willing to make it right at all. That was not the case here at all. Very, very professional and the final result after all of that is even better than what we originally imagined. Lots of compliments from the neighbors and visitors now and we've restored some attractiveness and value to our property.

We're planning to use Ergeon again for a side fence and wooden retaining wall next.</Review>

< Review>
Job foreman (Bernardo) scouted site & discussed project from customer's point of view, as well as from their service provisions.  My project coordinator (Magdalena) communicated job status, and answered any questions.  Met with the job supervisor (Luis) for 30 minutes (on day one of work) to review project, and any last minute concerns.  Magdalena informed me when the project was completed, and texted me pictures.  When I spotted a necessary correction that needed to be made, Magdalena was quick to contact the job (Luis) supervisor.  He oversaw the correction was made.  The only negative (minor) was that the employees tracked muddy footprints on our wood deck, but, did not attempt to clean off.< /Review>

<review>This is the only agency that I am aware of that can legally take child(ren) from their home and have little to no justification; by stating that it is in the interest of the child(ren). I haven't received an answer to a question asked quite a while ago. Question is: What is the procedure in handling child(ren) in order to comfort, console, calm child(ren) when "removing" them from their home? Is there a S.O.P manual that reflects the standard responses and techniques for said child(ren)?<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>While the first contact with cps however unpleasant the situation was that lead them to knock on my door was, the social worker who came treated me and the situation with dignity and respect. The subsequent contacts with the following older women were absolutely prejudicial and inappropriate at times. With one, I was literally harassed and bombarded with two separate workers to receive "services" and later bullied by one to sign a contract. As in, the worker sat on my couch and refused to leave my home until it was signed, despite the fact that the contract was supposedly "voluntary". Further an another contact by another older worker was met with near hostility and threats of their ability to remove my children.. (please note an initial contact was with a supervisor who clearly stated that despite the public opinion of cps they were not about removing children but rather keeping children safe in their home), upon receipt of the records of the last contact, (you have to petition the court at the juvenile hall fyi) the worker unethically misconstrued several statements and failed to report several contacts made via phone, and stated to the father of my child, that if cps were to remove my children by means of him making a complaint, its would be obvious that they would be placed with their father. She equally closed my case given the lack of evidence, "substantiated" the claim without sufficient evidence, and will hopefully hear from her supervisor after I make a formal complaint. Its never a positive thing dealing with child protective services, but the unethical, and abuse of power that was given makes them incapable in my opinion to remember what their job was in the first place. As one supervisor told me, workers are still people, some are good and some are bad. But maybe if I ever do come across any again, I'll be sure to remind them that unlike some of their other cases, I'm not only surrounded by mandated reporters myself, but am in the wait list for a county job that requires me to mandate report.</Text><rate>1<//rate>< userid>

Several members of my family, including myself, called to report abuse. However they did nothing about it. It had to come to the point that my sister was trying to kill her kid before CPS did anything.<//text>

A lot of you are complaining about abuse of power and I have yet to see that. If anything they don’t do their job. They will just believe whatever the crackhead parents tell them and that’s the end of it.</Review>

<Review>I've been coming to this church since i was young and it has been our go to church for years. It's a very beautiful building and the art is just breathtaking. Our priests are very friendly and like to crack some jokes during mass. Overall i just love this church and everything about it.< /Review>< GmapID>

The food was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. My wife and I were very pleased. I had the pork belly, she had the Kimchi stew and we shared the kimchi pancake. It was so good we brought our friends a couple of days later and we had a similar experience. Great service and a friendly staff.</text>

Banchan was OK - I liked the fish cake and quail eggs most.

5/5 Great service.

I had the japchae, seafood pancake, fried chicken (soy and garlic), and seafood tofu soup. Great portions and everything was delicious. 🤤< /text>

The outdoor seating is SO CUTE and spacious! The chicken wings with the hot and sweet sauce option. Wings are pretty juicy and tender. The Japchae which taste amazing with the bulgogi style sauce and finally the Budae Jjigae which came with its usual sides it also had spam, sausage and several other toppings. It was a bit spicy but no exaggerated but still enjoyable.
Everything we ordered can feed four to five people. Big potions too. I ended up taking the leftovers. We were here on a Saturday. They weren't busy. The servers were attentive and nice. Would definitely and will come back again. Parking sucks in this area.</review>

I really enjoyed this little Korean restaurant! Pretty good service. And quite authentic food with good flavors and fresh seaweed! I would definitely recommend this place if you want to have a taste of good Korean food! Admittedly, it’s not located in the safest part of town, but they are doing take-out only right now. It took them about 25 minutes to make 5 meals, just FYI.</text>

<rating>3</rating><Text>This review is based on my experiences with dine-in AYCE hot pot and ordering from them off of Doordash.

For hot pot, we came here on a Saturday so the price was $29.95. Got seated outside, and at first glance, there was a lot of accumulated dust on the table. Server didn't offer to wipe it down.

Hot pot itself was pretty good, high quality ingredients to choose from. Only complaint is that their menu and options are a bit limited compared to other AYCE hot pot places. They don't have the fancy seafood or meats that you'll find elsewhere. I just expect to get a whole lot out of my $30...

I've also ordered their Kimchi Stew and Hansang from here. Tbh, as a Kimchi Stew addict, not a fan of their version.
Couldn't care for their Hansang... Good value but food is mediocre. Daol Tofu House and other traditional Korean restaurants are nearby... so I would recommend those joints for solid Korean home-cooking.</Text>< Pics>

The biggest problem here is the service. The two guys that served us were cold and unwelcoming. When we sat down we weren’t given menus and had to ask for them, and upon asking we were met with a stiff scowl as if we were inconveniencing them. The cold service continued throughout the rest of the meal.

The service turned us off, and on top of that, the food just wasn't good. There is much better Korean food to be found at other restaurants in the Bay Area. Please don’t bother with this place.</Text>

<text>Amazing Korean food here! I came in Sunday night. Their kimchi must have been one of my favorite kimchis ever. Another highlight was the beef stew (I think). The servers were really polite and nice and when I showed them my Yelp review, they gave me a 10% discount or cash back. Interior decor was superb. They had very high quality speakers and their playlist was very nice. (Love to have it btw) everything in this restaurant was high quality and definitely on my revisit list. Very nas!< /text></record>

< Review>
Price $$$
Taste (1/5)
Service(1/5)
Interior(1/5)

IT WAS WORST KOREAN RESTAURANT IN OAKLAND.

FOOD - Ordered Kong Sam. It was not Kong Sam that I used to eat at other restaurants. I wondered how they made this simple food so bad. Soup was watery. Sauce was terrible. Ingredients was cheap and simple but too expensive. If it was delicious, it was okay. But not worth to pay.

Side dishes were also bad. I couldn’t eat them.

SERVICE - TERRIBLE. There were only two group(include mine) in the restaurant. But food came late. I also ordered two rice, but they didn’t give it. I tried to call staff but nobody cared us. So I went to the front desk to ask the rice.

Also after eating bad food, I tried to ask the bill. But staff ignored our table so I went to front desk to get my bill.

INTERIOR - BAD

I WILL NOT GO AGIAN. TERRIBEL FOODS AND SERVICE.</Review>

<review>I chose this place because I was under the impression that they had quite a bit of vegetarian and vegan dishes. The reason for this is because they have these little green leaves, which typically is a sign of vegetarian or vegan, but when I got there, I was disappointed to find out that they still put that next to some of their seafood items. For example, the seafood pancake has the green leaf next to it yet, the kimchi pancake doesn't? The green sign needs to be used properly or at the very least have a clear key on the menu that explains what that means.

I will say my parents, brother and sister in law are not vegan,  and the food was good to them. Not the best korean but they said it was good.

My husband, daughter and I ordered the veggie wraps - which was fine and simple, the soft tofu stew was okay, but the mushroom stew was not good - such a weird flavor.

I get they aren't a vegan restaurant, that is totally fine BUT my biggest problem is the misuse of the green leaf. If you are handling people's food, use the symbol properly and make it clear on the menu.<//review><user_name>Gjenes Belamide</user_name>< response>

<Text>Food is bland. Service wasn't too great.

I ordered the hotpot and it tastes like vegetable broth only.

Cost $30+ for this bowl of food. Large portion but not worth the price.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNC0Ue_7BHBnzFZVxh2zN7P_SUV-OnPCXLAkV_l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

i was hesitant to visit this place due to the negative reviews regarding poor service, but my friend and I were pleasantly surprised that the two servers were both very friendly and frequently checked up on us. bbq meats are so-so, but the hot pot was very good.<//review>

<Name>Sabrina Mah</Name><Date>1573341967925<//Date><Rate>2</Rate><Text>The atmosphere is nice and the design made me feel like I was back in Korea. Kimchi was very good.

I ordered kalbitang. It was a little bit bland and not a lot of glass noodles. The meat is supposed to fall off the bone, but it did not. I tried to take it apart in the bowl and i couldnt get ANYTHING. I had to eat it like an american rib...

Also all of our food came out individually one at a time... my friends had a rice bowl, the first one came out... the second one took another 10 minutes to come out... and then my soup took another 15 minutes to come out... we didnt really get to eat together because then our food would become cold.

Service was less than stellar. Its like they forgot about us. We were never checked on. My friend had to go to the back to ask for more tea, ask if they had forgotten my food, ask for the check...

Probably wouldnt go back.< /Text>< Pictures>

It's strange to hear your galbitang didn't fall off the bone because it's always really tender. If your meal is ever less than what you expect, don't hesitate to inform your server. We are happy to accommodate you with a different meal. Also, our meals do come out at different times so we can serve everything at it's freshest. While I understand that might seem strange, it's just how we do things around here. I will communicate this information to my staff to make sure we are providing only the best food and service, and I hope you'll consider giving us another chance. -Haguen, Owner"}< /Resp>

I have been searching for decent Korean food for last 2 years in this area. Hancook has become my favorite starting today. Tried beef bulgogi,  cold noodle and chicken with radish wrap. All perfectly cooked and served.</Text>

<Text>We had the dolsot bibimbap. Though the food was very good, portions are much smaller than a nearby establishment, and the sides provided are fewer.

Ambiance is great though, so if you wanted a bit more of an upscale feel, then I'd go here. If you're just looking for a less expensive and larger meal of similar quality, then check out neighboring restaurants.< /Text><userid>107254448142280399428< /userid><Rating>5</Rating><response>{'time': 1540487143655, 'text': "Jonathan, it's great that you were such a fan of the bibimbap!

Hancook replace Sahn Maru with identical interior just a few minor tweaks. You won't find wall of dining room fill with artwork anymore. Instead, a freshen up look with television tuned to K-Pop and warming coat of paint. While in soft opening mode, there are no special or discount given only hot same for $2.50 is all there is. Today I had business to conduct in area with Hancook listed as one of them. The staff are really honest and helpful to those never had Korean like the table next to me. No multiple pages of menu to deal with is a good indicator that they're doing what sells. With temperature nearing 80s soup or anything hot was on my mind. Rice bowl seems worthy and reasonable at a time like this. My finding of bowl which is flavorful with generous protein and good banchan. Side salad and soup compliment everything as whole meal. Of course, I can't leave without having a drink. Hot sake for $2.50 is consider best deal they have for any alcoholic beverage.<//text>

As it is industry standard,  we do ask that you return the products if requesting a full refund, as to ensure that you gave the product a fair trial. As an extra convenience, we offer a 40% refund to customers who do not decide to send back the product containers. I am so sorry for the confusion.  I will personally ensure you get a full refund; please email at sloane@dermalmedix.com and I will begin the refund process, no need to send anything back."}< /resp><Text>This product doesn't work and it's a terrible scam. It actually made my face drier. When I tried to return the product, based on their stated 60-day guarantee (I called in less than 30 days as the customer rep indicated) she tried to convince me to accept a 40% refund. Be careful of this company. It's a scam! (Update: The owner said he'd refund my purchase. I emailed him, at his request, and have heard no response. You can decide if these actions seem like ones you can trust.)<//Text>< username>

<Text>I have been on Prednisone for over 20 years and my skin was thinning and also I love the sun and use to tan year round in tanning bed. I have damaged me skin to the point I hate showing skin. I have been using your foot cream on my feet and legs i have been using the face cream on my face, neck, arms and chest. All of my skin looks so much better. It has reduce dark spots and the texture is firmer. I love your products. The products really work. Thank you!

<text>Although I ordered the product a while ago, it was delivered just recently. I have not had enough time to fully evaluate it, yet.
I have used it less than a week and have noticed that my skin does not feel particularly hydrated - it does feel a bit tighter. I have not yet noticed any positive results in texture. I will revisit my review after I have had more time.< /text><resp>{'time': 1591900443991, 'text': "Thank you for sharing, Kate!

I love, love, LOVE this product!!! I've tried pretty much everything on the market and for the first time EVER I'm seeing results! I'm 43 and I've always take care of my skin so I get a lot of compliments, but the other day someone thought I was 28!!! The wrinkles in my forehead and the lines around my mouth have reduced significantly. I will NOT be using anything else! Thank you for this AMAZING product!!!!</Review>

<user_name>Linda Sellers<//user_name><time>1601577690158</time><Rate>5</Rate><review>On June 20, 2020 I first used SculpMedix.  It has been a dream come true for me!  The first time I used it, it didn't burn or sting my face!  No one I know has more sensitive skin than I have.  It doesn't matter how much I've paid for products they have never made my face feel like a baby's bottom ALL DAY LONG!!!   This has taken away most of the redness and ALL of the flakes and some of the ugly skin growths and no more blackheads.  My pores are getting smaller and wrinkles are disappearing.  I'm 75 years young and am amazed by SculpMedix.  Thank you Dr. Watts for making this incredible product!  Your team is professional and helpful to answer my questions, too.

REVISED REVIEW: 10-01-2020     I just loved this product.  After about a month of using it, my skin broke out in a rash.  I have extremely dry, sensitive, red skin.  I have a reaction to most products.  It took awhile to cause this, but I had to return the product for a refund.  They were quick to return my money with no questions asked.  I only had to pay return shipping.  So sorry it didn't work for me as I loved how it made my skin so soft and hydrated.<//review>< Pics>

I am sure Dermalmedix will be great once I receive it. The tracking is showing the package is stuck in Chicago for more than 3 weeks now. Can not wait to receive it and comment on it.</review>

< Review>
Paul's Wife:  The DermalMedix face cream has worked very well in making my skin look and feel better.  I also used a small amount on the backs of my hands and they are definitely less crepey.</Review>

<Date>1594041010765<//Date><rate>5<//rate><Review>I have been using the cream for2 weeks now. At first only on the face,.i first realized that my face was starting to slowly change the 1st week. I used it. Times a day. In the morning and in the evening. I was amazed how the texture of my face was a softening and glowing. The2nd week , i decided to try iton my hands and arms and my chest. Tis is going into the 3rd week and my hands look so different. My arms are getting better. The chest is still not showing but maybe this week. Over all, i gave an excellent rating. Thanks for asking for my input. I'll keep you updated if you like.    Sammie Biar frim Pflugerville,Texa</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Let me begin by stating that I do not make it a practice to provide reviews. That is not to say that I never do. But that said, as a standard practice, I choose to not post negative comments. In truth I think it is a little premature to decide on the longterm results of any product that I have been using daily for less than 3 weeks. However, I would expect the makers of SculptMedix to know the timeline better than I would.

Here are my comments specific to my experience at this time:

For the first time, after using SculptMedix for about three weeks, last night I carefully scrutinized my face in the bathroom mirror and detected what I believe is a tighter complexion than I had before. When I apply the skin cream, I follow the directions carefully. Immediately after the cream touches my skin and for the first few minutes, or even up to an hour, my facial skin feels tacky. Then as the cream is absorbing there is a gentle physical sensation of my cheeks tightening as it dries. Once it is fully absorbed, I can unequivocally state that my skin is softer and more supple until the next application. I can definitely say that I like the way my face now feels to the touch. At age 73, I am not looking for an overnight miracle makeover, but none of the other facial creams I have tried resulted in the improvements I have already experienced with SculptMedix. By the way, I do not wash my face with soap nor do I use makeup.<//text>

When I use this product the wrinkles fade and my face is tight but it only lasts for a short time, a few hours. I was hoping this would be something that would improve my skin not just for a short period of time.</review>

I have only used this Sculpt Medix cream a few times per week for 2 weeks and have noticed that the wrinkles and sagging skin has reduced, or is less obvious. Thanks</Review>

<Review>I attend the Spanish masses and Father has the most clear explanation during the homily (sermon). Throughout the mass he includes comments and explanations 2 fully understand each part of the mass. I also see that everyone in the church and ministries are very friendly and helpful. I enjoy coming to mass every week!</Review><Date>1512888919908</Date><gmap_id>0x80dcb3b8e084c9cd:0x41724a88a0bbda40< /gmap_id>< Response>

< Review>
Saturday May 27 2017 the annual festival is up and at full speed. Well i know that this year is a smaller celebration but still glorious in his name.

👆
No need to be timid, were human also. stop to try the food you know you want to. Sunday last day for authentic delicious foods
👇

Been going there since I can remember.  Annual festival is going on, tomorrow is last day and the big 10k raffle. That's what's up!....

Update today June 12 2016 ... What a great turn out for the last day of the festival. And all the food from Mexican to philipino, and burgers made by the head usher, perfect day. Can't think of a better place to be right now.</Review>

Went to a service celebrating someone’s life. If the point is to bring people closer to god this man did the opposite of that. You want to save people but you’re turning them further away. You should be ashamed. I thought god is love but apparently it’s more important to push your conservative patriarchal agenda.< /review>

Enoteca Direct sponsors online, virtual wine tastings for which they sell tasting kits - four ounce samples of the wines to be discussed. Online, they have their own knowledgeable staff, often accompanied by principals of the wineries and PaulaL, their intrepid importer who knows the winemakers personally. It's an innovative and highly effective format, not only during pandemic isolation, but should endure into the new normal future. At the store, when I pick up a few bottles of the wines I enjoyed most at their tastings, the same friendly staff exchange observations and extra advice about the tasted wines and their other stock. It's like having a world of wine in your family!<//review>

Walking inside the store my eyes are drawn to the walls of wine...a bit overwhelming. BUT then I start to read the descriptions and the very affordable prices and the wines all seem to be making their way into my basket. The guys are easy to talk to and are able to offer some great suggestions!  I love how they have records all along the back wall...very hip!
I also participated in a zoom tasting with winemakers in Italy tasting 6 wines put on by Enoteca Direct! It was so worth it! I ended up buying all 6 we tasted!</Review>

<Review>Helpful staff -- they know their wines and can make recommendations based on your menu and event.  Wine in price "tiers" -- they have aisles of wines at the store that are "under $20" and "under $25" that are great for the price.  Tasting options -- they have quite a few wines each day that are available for tasting.  Unusual wines -- they find wines from grapes you haven't heard of, and wines from regions you haven't heard of (but next to famous ones you would pay twice as much for).    It is a carefully-curated wine shop, and it is easy just to go in and tell the staff what you are looking for and let them steer you and even teach you a bit while they offer different wines.    This is a place to enjoy!</Review>< pictures>

I've spent a lot of time in wine shops through studying for various wine credentials and this is the best I've found for selection, value, and service.

<review>Enoteca Direct is my go-to wine store! Ryan, Joe, and Mike always have great recommendations at a fair price. I love that they know me and my husband when we walk in and can help us decide on something we will love. In addition to the wine knowledge, this team is genuinely friendly and a great part of our community!  Thank you for over a decade of fantastic service in the Los Gatos area!</review>< pics>

I am in love with this wine shop!! It’s the perfect spot to stop in just before a dinner party for the perfect affordable small production wine you won’t see in the big box grocery stores. This shop is a neighborhood go to for “date night” wine especially when I’m board with the selection elsewhere. The shopkeepers are super knowledgeable about food pairings and if you are really nice, they might even pour you a sample!!!< /Text>

<review>Not your average wine store! Amazing wine selection from around the globe, accompanied by very friendly staff with a vast knowledge of their wine and recommendations on your personal taste. They have a great price range if you're looking for something more affordable (but still tasty) or looking to splash out. I'm always looking for Aussie wine and personally love that this place is not just focused on American wine and really has a global approach.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

These guys are the best.  Every person there is terrifically helpful, knowledgeable and ready to assist.  Wine selection is eclectic and very well thought out.  They have the ones you expect but many more from small producers.  This is the "go to" shop in the Bay Area.< /text>

Went in looking for a suggestion for a Champagne or sparkling wine for our anniversary.  The gentleman I spoke with gave me a couple of recommendations.  I bought two of them.  We had one for our anniversary and one the following week.  We loved both and in fact my wife thought they were two of the best she had ever had.  I have since gone back and purchased 6 more bottles.  Great service and great prices.< /text>

Val and I love this place.  Great wines, great people and great prices.  Their virtual tasting experiences are well done and have introduced us to some excellent wines.  Having access to small, family Italian wineries and their owners are a nice touch during the virtual tastings.  Most of the wines have been amazing.  It's fantastic to have options other than California wines for a change.</Review>

Enoteca is the best local spot to find a cultivated variety of domestic and international wines.  As a long time customer of their wine bar, I have always trusted their ability to help me find a wine that I would enjoy, and the wine shop takes that to a new level.  I love that I can go in and find a delicious wine for $15-25 (and they have a ton of options in that price range), but I can also find great champagne and other sparklings, as well as "fancier" wines if I want to splurge a bit.  They will be offering wine tastings soon too, and I cannot wait!< /Text>

Great addition to Los Gatos — especially for anyone who loves to explore wine! They have everything — from rare sparkling and reds to everyday sippers — this is an incredible little wine shop.< /review></record>

I’ve loved buying wine and enjoyed both store/wine bars! Their staff is so friendly and professional and love when they suggest wine.

My new favorite is going to their standalone store and listening to great tunes while shopping. My only problem is I don’t have enough space to store the wine I buy!

<text>For years I'd relied on a NYC wine merchant for a well curated and high quality selection of Italian wines. Then ELS opened shop in downtown SJ and I was able to say goodbye to cross country shipping forever. The ELS  wine selection will not steer you wrong and they procure unique wines one cannot find anywhere else.  Great pricing and friendly staff too.<//text>< Time>

This is a gem wine boutique shop hidden in Los Gatos.  I have been a customer at Enoteca La Storia for the past 7 years and their hospitality has been magnificent.  It is the Same when shopping at Enoteca Direct.  The knowledge and happy staff makes anyone feels at home.

A great place to visit!

<Name>Étienne Brown< /Name><Date>1621486853146< /Date><rate>5</rate><Text>This place is a pure gem. Ryan will go out of his way to ensure that you enjoy a good bottle (going as far as offering to deliver tasking kits to downtown SJ for free). Enoteca Direct offers interesting wines from all around the world, and the prices are more than reasonable. Cab, Pinot and Chard lovers will easily find something they like, and so will wine geeks (wine from Cyprus, anyone?). But I'll tell you what I like most about this place: the monthly wine tastings are such a good value that I don't understand how they even happen. For about 40 dollars, you get to taste five to six high-flying Italian wines, some of which sell for more than a hundred dollars a bottle (Brunello, Barolo, Barbaresco, Taurasi, etc.). And the tasting kits easily serve two people. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try! This independent wine store with passionate staff deserves your support.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The main reason for the score was because not only was the whole office caring and helpful but it was late before it was getting ready to close and I had made a last minute appointment added to her schedule and she accepted me with no hesitation and a great attitude and never rushed. She took her time and was very patient with me digging up my information.< /Text>

<Review>Edith did great work helping us prepare our documents to file taxes. There was an IT issue that was preventing her from submitting at the end for us which we had to set up a separate day just to come in to finish it. Then there's a billing issue where we weren't able to pay for the service and had to come in a third time to complete the transaction. We were really tired of the issues but otherwise, filing taxes was relatively painless for us.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Can't reach anyone on the phone, still haven't had my return uploaded to the portal after almost three months of engagement (and submitting all documents) with no explanation. I'm having to start all over again with another company. Glenda and Devra were supposed to be handling my case. Steer clear of this office!< /Text><resp>{'time': 1622818172172, 'text': 'Thank you for the valuable feedback.

Mrs. Vo, is very professional when preforming her job. I enjoy our conversation and concerns when preparing my taxes. She ask questions that will trigger my memory and offer suggestions as I inquire about tax issues.</text>

I was working under my F1 visa opt with a valid SSN which makes me a non tax resident according to the law, but the employee insisted I had to file as a tax resident. When I sent him the printscreens from both my school and IRS explicitly stating that I was non resident for tax purposes, his reply is that he has many years of work experience and I should not tell him what to do.
I took all my documents and filled with a real tax firm.< /text>

<text>I had a great experience with Dennis Lynch who made sense of our complicated situation (rental unit, self-employment, etc.) and was kind and smart and helped me navigate the labyrinth with good cheer. Taxes in general stress me out, and he was able to work around my imperfect record-keeping and find the documents we needed and I trusted him completely.<//text>< pics>

My wife and I have been coming here for 3 tax seasons so far and we've have had an amazing experience.  We've saved thousands of dollars every year with our tax preparer Loan.  She is really knowledgeable, especially for small business owners, and provides the best service.  Thanks so much!<//Text>

<review>Service charges are too high. Try to minimize that. I came from Hayward to Oakland, it's too far.  I disappoint with the charges. I could file my tax in Hayward in low rates.

<date>1382138195805<//date><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I had the exact same experience as the only other person to review this place (as of 10/17/13).  And I'm almost positive I had the exact same woman - the description of the previous reviewer fits her to a T.

She was unbelievably unhelpful. Refused to accept any documentation I gave her, insisting she needed it a different way.  When I had it on a thumb drive - she can't put that in her computer.  Can I email it? No.  I have a paper copy.  No, I need this electronically.  And so on.  She demanded I return multiple times with different forms, in obvious attempts to get me to give up.  Made different quotes in person than on the phone or by email.  She also took at least 5-7 days to answer any email, glared at me like I was death any time I came into the office, and ultimately made absolutely no progress in helping me with anything.  On purpose.  I was insulted, frustrated, and angry.  I had to demand that someone else help me - and even that took weeks.

Can't believe she still has a job there 3 years later.  No justice in the world.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<rating>1</rating><Text>In 2015, I had Fred Stevens prepare my taxes. Fred Stevens works in two offices, one at the City Center location, the other at Temescal (both in Oakland). It was the first time I’ve decided to use a professional service for my taxes. I’ve been doing my taxes via TurboTax for the past 10 years, never without a hiccup.

I decided to go to H&R block for my 2015 returns due to the complicated stock investments from my current employer. I figured, a professional will give me peace of mind. Boy was I wrong. It’s the exact opposite.

A few weeks ago, I received a letter from the IRS stating that my 2015 taxes were filed Incorrectly and that I now owe $8,885. I was completely shocked and appalled  given the fact that I knew that was the exact year I had Fred Stevens from H&R Block file my taxes.

I called back Fred Stevens with complete urgency. It took him a few days to call me back. I faxed over to him the necessary documents for him to “take a look at”. From there after 5 days of no response, I decided to track him down. He says “he was busy but needed more information”. So I faxed him again more documents… waited 5 more days of non response. Again I had to proactively track him down. This time he mentions, “It was his fault and he filed the taxes incorrectly but I would still have to pay the $8,885 to the IRS. Because I didn’t get the “Peace of Mind” Insurance Guarantee that H&R Block Offers”.

I don’t understand why I would have to spend extra money for “Peace of Mind” when these are professionals whom I initially went to for, Peace of Mind.

In the end, Fred Stevens said he will “try to make a claim” for me, but ultimately I don’t believe in his lies. Their website may say that Fred has 35+ Years of experience on there, but his professionalism is far from ideal. A true professional should be proactive in helping his clients. I feel that Fred is trying to avoid his mistakes. I have no faith in this company, nor would I ever have any faith in Fred.

Update.. it’s been day 3 since I last spoke to Fred and still no response or call back from him.

Please avoid this place at all costs.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<text>Leslie Lund is the worst tax preparere ever. I wont recommend this H & R Block. First, he did not read and look at my spreadsheet of costs send to him via email so he was unprepared. Second, my wait time was 20 minutes despite having an appointment. Third, he refused to explain why he was reclutant to do my long form tax filing and chose to do automatic deduction without my consent. Fourth, I was charged three times more than last year despite the fact I had filed long form and this time I did not.  Fifth, I have not received my refund for over two months and they have failed to do follow up. When I called H & R Block to find out why I have not received my refund, they were rude, insulted me and told me to go contact IRS when they advertise that they guarantee to make sure refund is sent or they pay it.<//text><Name>gingle kitty< /Name>< UserId.>

< Review>
Our hot water heater developed a leak early afternoon on a Saturday. I called several hot water heater installers and they stated the earliest they would be able to install a new hot water heater would be Tuesday but when I called 5 Star Plumbing the person who answered the phone stated they would be able to install a new hot water heater on 8:00am. Sunday. I then gave them my okay to that time to install the new unit. Then on Sunday morning @ 7:37am. I received a text that Ivan from 5 Star Plumbing was on route to install the new unit. Ivan arrived @ approx. 8:15am.. He finished the installation @ approx. 11:30am. I could not be happier with the installation and the professional work and manner of the installer Ivan. At this time I would recommend 5 Star Plumbing to anyone who might have a plumbing issue.<//Review>

I came home Saturday night to no hot water. I called a couple places and no one could come out on Sunday. This company came out within 2 hours and Khalil did a fabulous job. He was done I. Less than 3 hours replacing my very old water heater. I would recommend them and I will use them again!  Thank you for a stellar job!< /text>

These guys rock.  I had Bell Brothers out to quote a repair on a leaking pipe under my house, and they quoted $4,000.  Called 5 Star for a second opinion and they did it for a quarter of the cost, and had a technician out within an hour.  The tech was polite, answered questions, and did a great repair.  I’m a convert to 5 Star.</Review>

<text>Khalil came to fix a gate valve for the second time.  1st time water drip stopped just tightening the faucet.  It saved me money without replacing the valve.  Unfortunately later waterbeads slowly started to build.  Called 5-star plumbing to replace the faucet.  Khalil came on time and replaced the gate valve.  He’s very professional, skilled, and knowledgeable.  I recommend 5-star for their honest business and reasonable price<//text><time>1620662843016<//time>< gmapID>

Another company quoted us twice as much as five star to get the job done. We were encouraged to give up a 3-day right to cancel. But I maintained that I had a right to cancel before work was started the next day. That gave me time to look around. Thank goodness I did. 5 * came and did the job half the cost and it's a great job. They are professional and know what they're doing.</text>

<Review>We had a clog issue arise pretty quickly and was able to make an appointment for later that day. The technician arrived on the earlier side, and got straight to work. It seemed to be a difficult location for the clog, but when it was finally found, it got cleared instantly. We are happy we did decide to go with a professional, since this repair would of been way out of our league AND the technician informed us that our toilet has a slow leak. Thank you for all the help!

Update 3 weeks later:
Long story short. Do not contact them via their sales@ email regarding any post-visit inquiries or issues. Or respond to any emails from "Oleg" asking for a review are automated. I had waited three weeks for a response that I had no idea wasn't coming. I updated my review, and dropped the rating, and that alerted a response. 5 star called, having understood the issue from my detailed review update and sent a tech for a call back out to us later that afternoon. It was the same texh, and we had the same level of professional courtesy. As of now, we are informed that the issue is resolved and all should be well and unclogged.  Once they are actually aware of any plight, they are very quick to respond and handle.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We had scheduled an appointment with another plumbing company, but they canceled on us 2 days in a row, and the 3rd day did not show, nor did they call! I went online and filled out a quote after reading the great reviews Five Star Plumbing had on Yelp. Within 5 minutes I received a call and was told they could send a plumber out between 4:30pm-6:30pm the same day! I received a text confirming our appointment and a 2nd text a short time later stating the plumber was on his way. Our plumber, Victor, was awesome!  He was friendly, very courteous, and had our leak fixed within 30 minutes!

I would DEFINITELY recommend Five Star Plumbing if you are in need of a professional, prompt, friendly, experienced plumber.</text>

The technician checked the line to the city system but found no issues there.  He then told me that he needed to snake the system through one of the toilets.  He did that and we're good to go.  He spent a lot of time making sure everything was perfect before he left.  I would highly recommend 5 Star Plumbing.  Very responsive and professional!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

We were selling our house and needed fast service with high quality at a reasonable price. Adam came out and fixed the original leak then checked all house plumbing and identified a second leak. He fixed everything under the house in less than 2 hours and we are back in escrow.
He was extremely fast, very professional, explained everything and I couldn't be more pleased with his and 5 Star's performance. There's a reason its in the name!!!!
I will call on your company all the time for my plumbing needs.
Thank you

These guys were great, start to finish.  The phone call was smooth and easy - the person who answered the phone asked clear questions and got the info they needed. A plumber was here in less than two hours and cleared my line, gave me good advice about preventing further problems, had a good sense of humor and everything went smoothly!  Thanks 5 star and thanks Adam for a great service call experience on what was really not a good day 👍< /Text>

<review>We had a plumbing emergency. 5Star plumbing was able to come out the same morning. Peter determined that the do-it-yourself faucet we were trying to install in our shower was not compatible with the original plumbing resulting in a leak. Peter quoted us a price to change out the valve in the wall and install the new faucet for a reasonable price. Peter was professional and truly saved the day.<//review><Rating>5</Rating></record>

Victor was professional and courteous as well as knowledgeable.
Victor resolved the issue and explained how our sump system was working and what we might have to do in the future to prevent another incident.
The only downside to great service is cost ... it was not cheap but I would pay it again for such good service.</review>

< Review>
Water heater stopped working and I contacted multiple handymen and plumbers for estimates. Some were slow to response, overpriced, or appeared rude. 5 Star Plumbing was courteous and super responsive. They were able to send Ivan out to my home the same day and kept me updated when he is en route. As it turned out, my water heater parts are still under warranty. Ivan contacted the manufacturer for me and was able to get the parts shipped to me free of charge. Ivan ended up having to come back twice to my house because the manufacturer did not send all the parts the first time. Although frustrating, Ivan kept me updated throughout the process via text and came back to install the parts in between calls the next day. Really appreciate Ivan’s great customer service and professionalism!<//Review>

We've used 5 Star Plumbing twice: once to replace our pressure release valve and once to replace our water water heater. We were helped incredibly quickly (within 24 hours each time) and the price quoted was exactly what we paid each time. 5 Star is quick, reliable, helpful and always super clean and polite.<//Text>

This was the second time we used 5 Star Plumbing for their services. My boyfriend accidentally busted a sprinkler pipe while mowing the backyard. I contacted them and they scheduled the appointment for 0800 on a Saturday. Khalil was on time, had his mask and shoe covers on and fixed the problem right away. Also gave us a reasonable price for the job. Will not hesitate to use them again and will highly recommend them to our family and friends!<//Review>

This was our first time using 5 Star for plumbing services.  Adam and Amir did a great job with our valve replacement and faucet installation.  They explained in detail what they planned to do, and then explained again what they had done.  They were really fast workers; they completed our three jobs in about an hour, which included a trip to Home Depot for parts.  We will definitely use 5 Star again for larger plumbing jobs.< /text>

Very polite service man. I believe his name was Carlos. Unclogged the kitchen drain within minutes. But I was told by the receptionist that the $150.00 service fee would be applied towards my bill. If so then how did a 5 min job cost me $280.00?  Otherwise, I am happy with the job. I have a lot of plumming in need of repair but not at these prices. I'll have to look for another company</text>

I really appreciated that he got everything done in one visit. He had no problem running out to the store to get one more part because the plumbing in my house is kinda old. I had a slow draining sink, the toilet was acting up, and I had him replace the shower handle/mechanisms. Overall fantastic job. I appreciated his explanations, so I could understand what was going on while he was fixing it. I'm not versed in standard prices for plumbers, but it was in the range I was expecting. I definitely recommend them and will call again if I need more plumbing work done. Thank you so much for the wonderful work!! :)<//Text>< pics>

<text>I contacted 5-Star Plumbing after hours for a slow water heater leak coming from the top of the tank. I received a call back later that evening and scheduled an appointment for the following morning. Since our water heater is over 12 yrs old, I assumed it needed to be replaced so when the technician (Adam) recommended replacing the corroded pipe fittings rather than replacing the entire water heater, I was pleasantly surprised. After making the necessary repairs, Adam performed a thorough leak check and then proceeded to flush the water tank. Adam recommended performing this preventative maintenance annually and took the time to walk me through the entire procedure (step-by-step). I highly recommend 5-Star Plumbing and commend Adam for his honesty, professionalism and proficiency and for wearing a face mask at all times.< /text>< Pics>

We needed to check a leak in our front yard.  Ivan showed up on time and asked us questions.  He identified what the problem was in a very short time but also checked other things for us to insure we knew the issue so a permanent fix could be done.  It turned out to be an issue with water company and added comments to the email he sent us so we could show the water department.
Ivan was so detailed and knowledgeable we will definitely use 5 Star in the future.</Review>

<review>Called 5 Star in the Morning,  explained the toilet and bathtub was backed up in our only bathroom. Asked  if they had a same day appointment available, and they were here in 3 hours. Ivan was amazing, did the job quickly but efficiently. It was a bit more then quoted, however there was additional work required and that was explained during the call and in am email i received after the appointment was made. I will definitely use them in the future.<//review></record>

<review>5 Star came out to do an inspection on a house I am buying. They responded right away and were able to schedule the appointment very quickly, which was great. I had no issue with the job, except that the person on the phone told me the fees for service call and if they needed to scope the pipes (they didn’t), but did not say there was a separate cost for the inspection. When the guy finished the work on site, he told me it was $100 more than expected. On the phone I was told paying in cash meant a discount, so they should have told me all possible costs. Since an inspection was the expressed reason I called them, they should have told me what it cost when I scheduled the job.</review><Pics>None</Pics><date>1611157513051</date>< user_id>

<username>Jonathan Perez< /username><text>I had a gas leak in my backyard which made the fire pit unusable. PGE shut it off and recommended I get a plumber to fix said fire pit. I went with this company but it was $200 just to get a quote from them. The technician that came out told me he could repair the firepit no problem for $2000. I was happy with this estimate and went forward with them. The day of the job, I mentioned where the key valve was and the plumber said it shouldn't be an issue. The job I hired them for was the firepit, and that's the last thing they bothered to check even after I brought up my concern. After they tore up my yard, they finally looked at the firepit and told me that in fact the issue i brought up was an issue and they couldn't complete the job as promised and asked if I wanted to continue the work. At this point, a lot of damage had been done to my yard so I basically had to say yes otherwise it was all for nothing. And even though they weren't going to complete the job, they still were charging me the full $2000. Had I not complained to management, they would not have come back a few days later to connect the firepit and "fix" their damages. They couldn't even be bothered to put a stepping stone back and instead dropped it on a sprinkler. Management gave me a discount after my complaints but it should never have come to that. The plumber should've verified he could do the job before he ruined the lawn. Yelp doesn't let me post videos otherwise I would share here the interaction with the plumber. I regret hiring this company. You might have better experiences, but mine was terrible.</text>< Rate>

< Review>
5 Star and I agreed to a price to fix my sewer line.  They sent out a couple of guys out who thought the work was too hard and wanted 50% more money than the agreed upon price to finish the job.  I said no.  They left the job site only to find out later that they damaged my water line and tried to cover it up.  Now I have a huge leak that I had to pay another plumber to fix.  I explained what happened and sent them video and picture evidence.  They decided to ignore me...  They are very expensive and are only willing to help if you will pay their exorbitant prices.< /Review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Had 5-star install new toilet 2 years ago and they were great and inexpensive.  So when I had more plumbing work - including install of a toilet in a different bathroom - I called them back to schedule service.  Found out the toilet price had increased 35% in two years.  Oh well they did great work before so I hired them.  Everything was fine about the new service.

I am a return customer and this is the 3rd time that I have used "5 Star Plumbing".  I have used this company to replace bad missing plumbing and also for a bad shower faucet leak.  Each time I've called, a technician was at my home within and hour and the issued was fixed shortly after.

Great customer service and good work:)<//Text>

Super easy experience with 5 star. I contacted them and got a fair quote on Yelp and scheduled it for a few days later. Victor I think was his name came out and installed a replacement faucet in our sink. Because of how old our sink/house is, the new faucet wasn’t initially totally flush. Because this wasn’t the fault of the plumber and was because of the wonky sink, he could have left it as is or charged more to fix it. Instead he spent an extra 30 minutes making it perfect. I would use these guys again no question<//Text>

5 Star Plumbing replaced my toilet flange and installed a new toilet I provided. They had availability when I needed it, arrived when they said they would arrive, completed the work satisfactorily and timely, and all for a reasonable price.<//text>

My home had the original shower cartridge from back in the 80s when it was built. I was told very professionally that they might not be able to find a replacement, I appreciated being told upfront that information. However they ended up finding one, somewhere! I am so thankful for their help and expertise. I would highly recommend them to any and all of my family and friends.</text>

My hot water tank wasn’t working.  They were really easy to schedule an appt. with and came out right away on time but Peter was unprofessional. He walked in touched the side of the tank and said there was no problem. So tepid water is NOT hot water. He said it’s probably old you just need a new one. (It’s 4 year old). When asked what he thinks May have caused it, he didn’t know. He never looked at the thermostat or the heating elements. That was it. $145 for placing a hand on it and saying he would send some quotes for new ones. Won’t use them again.<//Text>

I called with an emergency and 5 Star had someone there in half an hour! This gentleman worked hard to solve my very clogged drains! Can thank them enough! I had to call them back because the house was still not drawing. They found the main line and put in 2 trap outs so that these problems wouldn’t repeat. Adam was very courteous and helpful. They left me feeling as though my chronic problem was repaired. They also cleaned the area when they were done.<//text>

Called and was immediately booked for same-day appointment. Khalil arrived within an hour, wore all the appropriate safety gear for these COVID times (mask, booties, gloves), and did a wonderful job fixing our clogged line! He also explained the source of the issue and recommended what we should do to avoid trouble down the road. Very happy I called this company! :)<//text>

Both bathrooms and kitchen sink were completely clogged after a few days of normalusage. I messaged these guys on Yelp late at night and they were able to send a tech in the morning! He tried to do the usual thing to clear the sewage but found some tree roots :( They sent another tech with more equipment for a camera inspection in just a few hours. They found the cleanout ( I didn't know the house had one) and were able to clear out the roots form this old leaky clean out. Gonna be using them again to replace the cleanout.

<Review>So I’ve been having issues with both of my toilets not flushing regularly. I went to Yelp and reached out to a few companies. 5 Star was the first to reach out, the first to schedule an apt and came quite quickly. The technician also was able to complete the job and save me money (apparently there was a rock lodged in the outdoor pipe and had they had to dig it would’ve cost me a fortune). Very friendly service and I would recommend them again.<//Review>< pics>

<rating>3< /rating><review>Originally I gave a 5 star review because the service was fast and very friendly and professional.  Unfortunately, it turns out that all three of the items I asked to be completed were either done incorrectly or had to be re-addressed.  It could have just been a bad day so it was hard for me to change my review, but I needed to.  The customer relations aspect was always excellent at least.< /review><Time>1612561350908< /Time></record></dataset><record>

5 Star was excellent! They responded to my email inquiry in a few minutes and set up an appointment for the next day someone to come out to give me a bid on replacing a metal toilet flange and wax ring.  The repairman arrived right on time.  He was pleasant and professional.  I agreed to let 5-Star do the work.  Adam, the repairman, got the repair done quickly and efficiently.  He also cleaned up after himself and left the bathroom in good shape.  I was positively impressed!< /Review>

<Text>I called the 5 Star Plumbing late afternoon on Oct 22 and explained the urgency for fixing the water line leak expeditiously.  The service dispatcher (Adam) promptly acted and arranged for a inspection the next day in the morning between 8 and 10 AM.  The plumbing technician (Khalil K) came to my place sharp at 8:00 AM and went to work and accurately diagnosed the leaking issue and took video clip of the pipe failure to document it well. The technician followed all safety procedures and did a neat job.  I couldn't be more happy.  In fact, I am willing to agree that this was probably the best plumbing job completed by any plumbing company that I had to use.  Strongly recommend this company to anyone who needs a prompt and good plumbing work.  However, this company is pricey and if they can lower their price, the are definitely going to dominate the Sacramento area.

< Review>
I was out of town when a pipe burst in the backyard and the wife had called to as they were the only company that had availability. They couldn't find the water main shutoff valve so they weren't able to fix the pipe. I had never had to shut the water main off so I couldn't direct them over the phone as I wasn't exactly sure were it was. You would think this would be pretty standard for a professional plumber. They walked around the property for about an hour, eventually said they couldn't do anything without shutting the water off and still charged us $149 for the visit. When I got home it took me about 2 minutes to find it in the front yard. What a waste of time and money.  I would not recommend using this service< /Review>

We thought we had a leak from our second floor bathroom into our first floor den ceiling. Called a couple of plumbers and 5 Star was able to schedule us quickly. We did actually schedule a 2nd service to come out as we thought we'd need bids, the soonest the could schedule us was a week out. Dimas at 5-Star came texted he was on his way, was actually early. He spent quite a bit of time investigating the issue and we knew we would need to cut into the ceiling to identify the issue as there was no outward appearance of any issues upstairs. After some time the issue was resolved. No major repair needed. Short of some dry wall and a very reasonable sevice charge that we were quoted up front we're good to go.

I'm typically a fairly handy person, and I enjoy doing my own repairs. Had a clog in the tub, and I couldn't quite get it through the cross bars of the drain, so I removed it. Wrong move! Turns out that when the previous owner renovated the bathroom, they used the wrong flange, and I couldn't get it to screw back into the pipe! After muddling about in the crawl space, I finally called 5 Star Plumbing, and they were able to come out about an hour later. They were able to replace the part and get everything connected back up in ~30 minutes. I was incredibly impressed with the staff - they were friendly, efficient, and mindful of Covid-19 precautions. But above all, I appreciate that they dealt directly with me, and not my husband (who was also home), because I'm the one who called in and knew what was going on. 5 stars for 5 Star Plumbing!<//text>

<review>I had a gas leak in my backyard which made the fire pit unusable. PGE shut it off and recommended I get a plumber to fix said fire pit. I went with this company but it was $200 just to get a quote from them. The technician that came out told me he could repair the firepit no problem for $2000. I was happy with this estimate and went forward with them. The day of the job, I mentioned where the key valve was and the plumber said it shouldn't be an issue. The job I hired them for was the firepit, and that's the last thing they bothered to check even after I brought up my concern. After they tore up my yard, they finally looked at the firepit and told me that in fact the issue i brought up was an issue and they couldn't complete the job as promised and asked if I wanted to continue the work. At this point, a lot of damage had been done to my yard so I basically had to say yes otherwise it was all for nothing. And even though they weren't going to complete the job, they still were charging me the full $2000. Had I not complained to management, they would not have come back a few days later to connect the firepit and "fix" their damages. They couldn't even be bothered to put a stepping stone back and instead dropped it on a sprinkler. Management gave me a discount after my complaints but it should never have come to that. The plumber should've verified he could do the job before he ruined the lawn. Yelp doesn't let me post videos otherwise I would share here the interaction with the plumber. I regret hiring this company. You might have better experiences, but mine was terrible.</review>< userid>

I received a call from Peter asking if he could come earlier than scheduled, which worked extremely well for me. He arrived on time, was very nice, personable, clean and very knowledgeable. He got right to work and was finished within a short while. It was well worth the money as I was not able to remove and old leaky faucet bc the nut underneath the sink was frozen in place. Peter had to cut the metal flange out of the sink. A job I could not have done on my own. Peter was very respectful and I appreciated his expertise in knowing the little tricks of the trade..I absolutely would recommend 5 Star Plumbing!!!</review>< Pics>

I got an initial quote from Roto Rooter for $4800. I had a shower cartridge issue and they tried telling me I needed a bunch of other things done. I was skeptical. I immediately called 5 star and Ivan showed up and fixed the actual problem for $280. 5 star was there to fix the problem and not to up charge me by creating new ones. 10/10 would recommend.< /Text>

<Review>We had an 'unidentified' water leak on our property that was sending our water bill through the roof!  5-Star came out on the same day we called, within hours, and throughly inspected our property to detect the source of the leak.  Once found, they capped the leak: was sprinkler main leading from the house to the valve controls.  Unfortunately, the primary repair will require a sprinkler repair company and the broken pipe is under our patio.  However, at least we don't need to worry about the exorbitant water bill in the interim until we are able to have the issue repaired.  Thank you to 5-Star for saving the day, and saving us continued uptick on our water meter!!!< /Review></record>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I am very impressed with 5 Star. Adam A. wore a mask the entire time and was professional and friendly. Not only did he quickly diagnose my kitchen sink problem, he even went the extra mile to fix and seal it for free. Throughout the service he would clearly communicate what needs to be done before he does it. Also he would gladly share his knowledge on what I should do to preserve the condition of my sink and all the attached tubes. Another thing: he is extremely honest in billing.

I will surely use them again in the future.<//Review>< pics>

Tech was on time and efficient. Very respectful of my situation to find the water leak. He found the leak from the dishwasher in minutes. He turned the valve to the water supply off and the valve was broken. He replaced the valve, a $20.00 part, and helped me turn the power off to the dishwasher for safety. Good service but very expensive. Total was $220.00 to replace that valve. All work was done with 45 minutes.</text>

< review>
Rarely have I been so impressed with a company. I found these guys on Yelp (just left a Yelp review too) and called them frantic on a Sunday when I found that my washer was causing gross black gunk to backup into my bathtubs and causing the toilet to leak. I was horrified and scared after reading online that it could be a sewer issue that might cost me some $6,000. The lady answering was super nice, professional and said someone would be here within the next three hours. On a Sunday! As soon as I hung up, I received a text confirming my request then within 20 minutes, a text saying someone was on their way. Mike arrived within one hour of my initial call. He wore a mask and shoe covers in the house (which none of the other contractors have done) and had me unclogged within 30 minutes. He explained the issue, made recommendations, did not try to up-sell me and the cost was far better than I’d imagined. I see they do electrical to so will plan to call this company again for all my future plumbing and electrical work. Mike saved my day! Super professional, knowledgable, honest, responsive...What an outstanding company!  10 stars!</review>

<Text>Great experience with them. Ivan was great and knowledgeable. He came out to install ceiling fans in the house when other companies said they couldn’t do it. Had him come back to trouble shoot some outlets I had problems with. Ivan had the job done correctly and fast. Would definitely recommend.< /Text>< Pics>

Hi D<//Name>
< Text>
I contacted 5 Star Plumbing yesterday and already have a new water heater today! Peter showed up well within the allotted 2-hr window, assessed the issue,  gave me a quote and had my new water heater installed before lunch. He was very friendly and professional too, even helping me identify why I was having a water pressure issue.

5 Star was also great at keeping in contact, letting me know Peter would be arriving and what time, and have already send follow up messages. It is not fun having to spend money on a hot water heater, but at least they made the process so much easier. Thank you Peter & 5 Star!</Text>

Great communication and very professional. I have used 5 Star Plumbing for other repairs and have always been impressed with their service. Today I had my old rusty water heater replaced. I would highly recommend this company for all your plumbing needs.< /Review>

The technician that came to my house was friendly professional and efficient. I was in need of a plumber ASAP on a Saturday. My appointment was at 12:30 and the technician called and arrived at 10:00 am. I am so appreciative of the service I received as I was going to have a house full of people by 3:00 pm<//text>

I called 5 Star in late afternoon with a leaky water heater. They arranged someone to come the same day. Adam came by and he already knew what the problem might be and came with all that is needed. Explained to me the problem and we replaced the heater in short order. He was professional and explained what he was doing. I highly recommend them and will use them fir any future help.< /text>

<Review>Had a water leak in the garage on a 2 years old house, 5 Star pluming showed up on time, found the leak and fixed the problem in a few hours.
(caused by driving 2 nails into the pipe by builder)

Very expensive! $325 for a 1/2 hour of work and left without checking to make sure all drains were running clear. When I called back to let them know, i was told it would be another charge. I will never use this company again.</Text>

He recommended that there was a bigger issue then just needing the toilet resealed as he thought there were roots. We rescheduled for the next morning, as we had to get a new toilet, and he was on time and very professional. Instantly he found the route of the problem (pun intended) and got to work. Peter was very kind and was very quick. Highly recommend 5 star plumbing to anyone that is looking for a honest, professional, and quick service.< /Text>< Pics>

Highly recommend 5 Star Plumbing. Responsive and were able to come out and complete job same day. I had a pipe burst on Veteran's Day and they replied to my request.  They had to cancel my appt the day before but came out next day at the time I requested. Their tech Adam came out and identied the leak. It was raining hard outside and the pipe was in my muddy crawl space from it flooding. He was real professional, gave me options, and got the job done in a couple hours. Fair enough price. Big relief headed into the weekend. Glad I only had to go 3 days without running water...< /Review>

Great experience!  I needed a new disposal and wanted a quick price before booking.  Out of numerous contacts they were 1 of 2 that responded.  Responded right away and with every message sent I got an immediate response.  They arrived earlier than scheduled, got in and out and wha-la .... my Mom has a working disposal again!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND !  Thanks so much!</text>

<userid>112917508606299565121< /userid><Review>Professional from start to finish. Peter arrived on time, got right to work, and explained his work along the way.

We had a significant leak in our sink drain pipe which required going into the crawlspace. I wasn't doing that. But Peter did! Turns out we had two leaks. He replaced the entire line plus junction. He was quick, explanatory, and took pictures so we could see what was happening.

We called yesterday afternoon, he arrived this morning, and finished the work within a couple of hours. Peter was very personable.

The job was reasonably priced but the lifetime warranty on the work made it a deal. The peace of mind has no price.

Joe quickly found the reason the unit was clogged. Raw zucchini was too spongy. He reset the unit and took a photo of the red reset button under the unit so I can reset if it clogs again. Very helpful!! My doggie Clyde so enjoyed Joe’s visit!!</review>

5 Star plumbing came and sealed a toilet that was leaking amd also unclogged a line in my sink that was sending water all over the counter top when my dishwasher ran. They were very efficient, on time, friendly and I was very happy with their work. I would definitely call them

My water heater went out yesterday and I called this company since they had a great rating on google.  Adam was the representative that came to my house and he was very knowledgeable about the water heater and was able to help me get the problem fixed.   Adam took his time to diagnose the issue quickly and was great at communicating the issue to me right away.  I will call them again. Thanks.< /text>

Communication was great. We had a problematic plug in our kitchen sink. On the first visit they could not clear the drain so they didn't charge me for the attempt. Scheduled a video inspection and they came out and found the clog and repaired it. I would definitely use them again<//review>

Long story short: we found ourselves in a bit of a jam with two kitchen projects. We were short on time but long on our list of concerns. We called 5 Star Plumbing to request a quote and assistance. Not only did they arrive that same afternoon, but they accomplished everything we needed assistance with and did so at a fair and affordable price.<//Review>

When all was said and done, they did a good job fixing my broken water main line. The price seemed pretty high considering the work involved, but that’s what you have to pay for an emergency service. I called and within 2 hours someone was here to fix the broken pipe. I would most likely use them again.<//text>

When it comes to plumbers in Sacramento I have had some horror stories. It wasn't until I called 5 Star Plumbing that the nightmare of constant back pressure issues in the upstairs bathroom ended. These guys at 5 Star Plumbing really know their stuff, and corrected the issue where so many others couldn't resolve the problems. We will always call them if we have a future emergency plumbing need. Very professional,and clearly experienced.  Highly recommended<//review>

Toilet was leaking oy vey
Looked at Yelp try this service  They gave me an estimate of the cost of $149 to come take a look see and then if there were any other costs that $149 will go into it.
I've dealt with toilet leaks before, but this one was new.
Their experts are very good I cannot say enough I found out that I had two small little itty bitty leeks causing the problem He took the time to fix it and got it done and over with he made sure that it wasn't leaking and he told me to keep an eye on it for at least 24 hours which is totally understandable. So far everything's drying up no more leaks I'll probably get back to this in the next week just to give you an update.
Best part I can say is that we both wore masks especially during these times.  Their experts are very kind courteous knowledgeable and they get the job done.< /text>< name>

I had water accumulating on the ceiling due to ac issue. They were prompt, arriving at the property a couple of hours after I called them. They were thorough in their assessment and in explaining what the issue was. They fixed the problem and the price was reasonable. Really happy with the experience and will use them again.<//review>

< Review>
I had 5 Star Plumbing come to my home to repair the water line going into our home. They came on time, but gave me a proposal way out of line. I had dug the hole so all that had to be done was cut the 1-1/2" pvc line and install a couple of 45 deg elbows and a short pipe between them. The plumber indicated it would take him just one hour and the price would be $840. I had another contractor do the job for much less.< /Review>

Had a great experience with 5-star.  They were timely...actually called to see if they could move me up in terms of time.  Explained the issue to me clearly...didn't try to up charge me, and did a quick and effective work.  REcommend them without hesitation.< /text>

<Text>Peter came to my address and did a fantastic job, the only reason it is not 5 stars is because price was $480 for a new faucet, which I thought could have been slightly cheaper, and my plumber took his mask off while inside.

If you need a plumber I would highly recommend. They responded within a couple of hours and fixed the issue pretty quickly. My drainage system in my bathroom broke and left a mini flood. The plumber had what I needed on hand and quickly fixed it. I also had a “jiggly” toilet handle issue for months that he quickly fixed for me! Highly recommend!</Review>

Everything about 5-star was amazing. We had a very uncomfortable experience with our main sewage line and 5-star held our hand throughout the entire process. The price was more than 50% less than other quotes we received. They were honest, reliable and excellent with communication from the moment I called the customer service number. I highly recommend this company and will definitely use them again when we need any plumbing work.< /Review>

The Repair Man, Ivan, showed up on time, diagnosed the problem well, and then HUSTLED across town to get the part before the supplier closed.  He then Hustled back to my home to finish the job in one day.  Fantastic service!< /Text>

Petter was great. . Ivan the other guy for this company, he’s pretty excellent also. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate your help. Yesterday my tech was Ivan. He installed  some bypass flow valves pieces and some little motherboards for them in my Tankless Water Heater. He did an excellent job. He’s very very knowledgeable and I have to say he’s probably my favorite plumbing guy. Of course I give  him & the company both five stars. More if I could.

< Review>
We called in the morning and they were able to get us in before 4pm! Adam was early, professional, and went above and beyond. He came out for a leaking water valve, which he fixed. As he was leaving, we flushed the toilet and it started leaking! We were able to catch him before he left, and he replaced our wax rings. We have had problems with our toilet leaking on the past, and he solved the problem by using two wax rings. We will never use any other plumbing company and we will tell you friends and family to use them for all their plumbing needs! Thanks again Adam and 5 Star Plumbing!</Review>

Again they did great job just as they have done ethical work that hard to find in california.
Other company was going to rip off of us by quoting $ thousand for last job but he solved hot water issue for $200.. Thank you keep it up and keep your reputation in tact so you don't need to spend big advertising as you have enough customer base.
Eventually your good work pays off as form of customers trust you and willing to pay top dollar for your service..</Text>

Joe was fantastic and did exactly what I expected of him to do on our bathroom fixtures. Easy to communicate and he was here when the customer service said that he'd be in our place within an hour! I'll definitely use him again and will going to share the companies number when someone needs a plumber. Thank you so much Joe for the awesome plumbing service you did on our bathroom. Kudos!</text>

I had the best experience with 5 Star Plumbing. A pipe broke over night and they came same day at the time they stated & dI'd a superb job fixing the issue.

I offered to pay cash for the service and misheard the amount on phone. They were gracious to accept the payment though it was few dollars short in light of  COVID..above and beyond the call of duty.

Highly recommend.< /Text>

I had a leaky toilet that was discovered in early Friday morning.  At 830 am I promptly called 5 Star Plumbing to schedule an appointment and was told the earliest time a repair man could arrive was 230 pm. I booked the appointment.  Although I had another engagement scheduled at 1pm, the leaky toilet was more important and so I
called to cancel my 1pm booking.  5 Star Plumbing called to let me know a repair man would be available to come earlier than 2:30 pm and if that was okay. I quickly said, "Absolutely!" At 10:30, Brandon arrived. After showing him the troubled toilet, he quickly went to work.  The work was completed in 1 to 1 1/2  hours.  I was able to attend my other appointment at 1pm!  Brandon was very knowledgeable and professional. Thank you 5 Star Plumbing!</review>

Peter was punctual and very knowledgeable about his work. Even though there was a miss understanding with the quoted price from the office he worked to rectify it. Would recommend him. I would recommend to go over the quoted pricing with the person doing the job before, to make sure it was understood well.</Text>

<Text>I had a leaky shower head. The technician that came out was Ivan. Ivan was super professional and detailed in what he was doing for the repair. He even showed me how I can repair the leaky shower head if it ever happened to any of my other showers. He swapped out the cartridge that controls the on/off for the water. He showed me where the rubber gasket went bad and how I can tell in the future if I will get a another leak. The repair is warranted for a year. He also does Heating and Air. He showed me some easy maintenance I can do yearly so my AC unit stays in top condition.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>I had a serious wiring problem between my electrical panel and pool equipment including pool filter, pool heater, and pool sweep installed in 1976.  Ivan V. Was the technician that serviced the problem, his expertise was outstanding and he far exceeded my expectations that let to totally new wiring, reviewing all wires replacing as needed or required as well as completion of everything needed to return my wiring to totally new standards!  Job well done, I’m totally satisfied and recommend 5 star for your electrical needs!!!!😎< /Text>< pictures>

So after finding a marshy muddy mess in my yard I realized my water line was leaking. I grabbed a shovel and dug up the line to find the pvc spraying a substantial amount of water, my yard was flooding slowly. I called several plumbing companies and none were available same day. 5 star wasn't available either but the woman who I spoke with promised to call if they got a cancellation. And they did!! Adam was not just on time but early! Professional, fast and did a fantastic job! I highly recommend them🤗<//Text>

Came out the same day I called. Arrived early within the 2 hour window time frame they gave me. Cleared sewer line in about half hour, showed me what the problem was, charged what I was quoted. Joe was very professional and efficient. Very happy!<//text>

I contacted 5-star plumbing via yelp in the evening and they responded promptly the next morning. They were able to get Adam to my house within 2 hours of contacting them.  Adam was able identify the source - being a leaky overflow drain. He was able to patch the drain within 1 hour. I would definitely use 5-Star Plumbing in the future for their quick response and quality service!<//text>

I found and contacted Alex of 5 Star Plumbing to help us out with a leaking water pipe. He was quick to respond to my request, friendly, clean, careful, courteous, and reasonably priced for the awesome services. From the time I contacted him to the time the job was done he was superb - and time really counts when it comes to plumbing problems just days before the Holiday Season comes! We'll definitely keep his contact info and recommend their company to others.< /Text>

There is so much to say about this company with relation to their professionalism and the hard work ethic that goes into this.
I would like to highlight the work that Nazar and Adam put in at our home to resolve the issue. They were both very professional and ensured that I understood what procedures are being done to the plumbing.
So many great things to say about this company and the work they have done. Will definitely hire again in the future.<//Text>

<Text>The people here are professional and friendly (both the appoint person and the two plumbers I’ve met in the past couple of years).  They are reasonably quick with the job, and obviously knowledgeable.  The first time was more than a year ago with a bathroom sink installation.  This second time was with emergency repair.  I would feel comfortable calling them again if I need anything done.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
After discovering a leak dripping from our ceiling directly below our master bath (shower), we contacted our landlord and they called 5 STAR PLUMBING. Our landlord said they would arrive between 8-9 am...

It was only minutes past 8 o’clock when we heard our door bell ring. The friendly face on the other side was nothing shy of polite and persistent. He got started immediately and informed us of everything going on along the way.

By 9 o’clock, only 1 hour later, he was done!

Our leaky drain was fixed and sealed!

Thank you for an outstanding job! We highly recommend this company to anyone who expects immediate results!!!!!<//Review>

<Review>Alex and Mark were AWESOME young men and found the problem and fixed it in the blink of an eye.... I was honestly amazed how quickly they completed the job!
Anna and another gentleman, I didn’t get his name but wished I had were extremely helpful on my first call to them, they went above and beyond getting Alex and Mark out to my home in less than an hour on a Friday evening (right after Christmas)....
I sure am happy and relieved to know that I can call
5 STAR PLUMBING and know that I will be in great hands!!!!
THANK YOU AGAIN 5 STAR!!!!< /Review>< time>

Customer service was very responsive and able to send plumbers to our home the following day. Plumbers came on the scheduled time and proceeded immediately to work. they were able to check the water system and found out the pipe with leaking. They were quick and fast and able to finish the work within the day. Reasonably priced for the quick service.</Review>

I had 5 star run a gas line to my kitchen so I could change from an electric range to a gas one.  They were very thorough, helped me get through the permit inspection etc.  Showed up on time and the technicians were very nice and professional.  Inspection passed with flying colors!  Would definitely use them again!< /text>

Mark came by, delivered excellent customer service and solved our issue. The job was tricky, but he did not give up and he took his time to complete the job. His determination gave me the impression that he actually cared. He even fixed the sink real quick, which was a whole separate job! This employee deserves recognition, and props to 5 Star Plumbing on giving me a great experience using your plumbing service for my first time.</review>

We needed someone out ASAP for a leak we detected while trying to sell our house. 5-Star got someone out right away, and the tech arrived on time. Our tech was very knowledgeable and professional and had the leak repaired in no time! Thanks 5-Star!<//Text>

My family recently moved to a new house and we had some major backups due to old leaking pipes and tree roots. I called around to get price comparison from a few companies.5 Star come and did camera inspection and shared the video with me. They provide a good estimate and finished the job using the latest technology. Thanks again,  for all your hard work, dedication and time !< /text>

<Review>When we ran into a construction problem with the way our house was built, I really felt that the plumber was very honest and gave me his professional opinion and didn't pressure me to make a decision right then. He told me to let them know when I was ready to get the work done. I will recommend 5 Star Plumbing to others.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>We were looking to get some advice on our HVAC system and called multiple companies. Oleg came out on time and was very professional. He provided good information about our particular system and what are options were. The suggestions he made were sound and appreciated. We ultimately decide to not do anything with our system, but when we do in the future I will definitely call Oleg again.</review><Name>Bryan Barrett<//Name><Resp>None</Resp><user>102015840885957430555</user>< time>

All of the people that I have interacted with (Joe, Brandon, Adam, and another man who came with Adam, sorry I didn’t catch his name) were very friendly. They replaced my bath tub drain and pipe in less than an hour. I appreciated the text messages to let me know a technician was on the way and that the technicians wore shoes covers in my house.  Highly recommend and will be using them again in the future!<//text>< pictures>

<review>Five stars for 5-stars!  Kudos to the guys who came to replace our bathtub and wall.  It took them all day, although they could have come back on a different day to complete the job, they didn't.  They chose to stay longer and finish the job, which we were very grateful for.

<Text>They were out at my house within an hour of my call. The shower diverter broke in my hand while I was cleaning the bathtub. It took the plumber less than 15 minutes to replace the faucet with new diverter. A bit expensive but convenient as it was fixed the same day. Ivan was very nice.</Text>< date>

It was a great pleasure having Paul as our plumber from 5 Star Plumbing. He was quick and fast in repairing our kitchen water pipe and checking the other pipes for leaking. Service was fast and reasonably priced. Will surely recommend them to our family and friends.</Review>

<Review>Mark from 5-Star Plumbing showed up at my mother's house. He listened to what we said regarding repairs.  I was impressed that he didn't immediately recommend replacing her water heater,  but instead a repair.

I will be calling 5-Star Plumbing to do repairs at my home.

<Review>I am very pleased with 5 Star Plumbing. I was able to get appointments quickly and easily. The plumber arrived promptly and I even got a text to let me know he was on his way to my home. The work was done efficiently and was better than expected. The plumber was quite helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. He was happy to answer my questions and give me advice on a somewhat complicated job. I thought the prices were quite reasonable for the work performed. Excellent experience.</Review>< Pictures>

My garbage disposal was not turning on and  I had a leak under the kitchen sink. I decided to reach out for assistance.
5 Star was the only available service that answered very fast and professionally. Vitali (I believe that was his name) arrived on time and was super pleasant. He quickly installed the new garbage disposal and fixed the leak. He left my kitchen spotlessly clean.
Excellent service.<//Text>

It was a great service they had for they were able to do a repair of our leaking water pipes in the kitchen that connects to the second’s floor bathroom. They were quick and fast in providing the solution to our problem. they were able to finish the work within the day and cleaned the area right after the work. they even went above and beyond our expectations in doing some extra work in checking the other pipes that may have some problems in the future without any extra charge. We do recommend their services to everyone.< /Text>

1/4th the price of Roto-Rooter.  Professional, prompt, and affordable.  Our kitchen sink and washing machine were backed up.  I rented a drain snake but couldn’t get through.  Should have just called these guys from the beginning.  Thank you!</Text>

I really like their service and the quality of work.
The technician was ver helpful with question and seemed very knowledgeable.

Only strange thing that took me off guard was when they charge 3% fee if you use credit card.
I don’t know if 3% service fee is a common practice.<//text>

Thankfully, Oleg was very diligent and made sure that there wasn’t anything stuck in the sewer area. He also capped off an extra p trap for us that we didn’t need. Every time he came in the house he made sure to wear protective booties so as not to track in dirt, which we also appreciated.

We had a big job (whole house repipe and replumb, with water heater replacement) and they were very accommodating throughout the process. It really seemed like they wanted to do quality work. Would use them again.< /review>< rating>

He was polite, friendly, and quick:). He took the time to explain the pricing and show me the part that needed replacing.  It was a very smooth experience.
Last time, we called the day before we were having 40 people over for a party and ALL of our toilets overflowed and flooded the bathrooms!! Peter came out THAT SAME DAY and took care of everything, including replacing a toilet AND helping us get rid of the water on the floors before the guests arrived!  These guys are really great and very knowledgeable!
They will always be my first plumbing call!< /review>< user>

<text>I got a lemon of house and have dealt with many service industry professionals. I’m always apprehensive when it comes to calling professionals to come out to my house and give me an estimate to repair what’s broken. They try and upsell bigger, better, new models, etc. and take up all my time for the day. I just want an honest, quality company to give me the facts. 5 star plumbing service is indeed 5 stars! Customer service is outstanding!

I’m so glad I found 5 star plumbing! Everything was so pleasant, from point of contact to scheduling. They text you when their Tech is en route. So organized, I love it!

The Tech, Nazar, arrived on time and fixed the problem.  My water heater was acting strangely, resulting in low hot water pressure. Awesome service, no BS, just troubleshooted and fixed it!   He even helped me close my garage door because it also needs to be fixed but that’s another story.  Thank you so much 5 star plumbing!
I definitely recommend them and will use them once my water heater will need to be replaced.</text>< GmapID>

I am utterly satisfied with this company and the employees! A young man named Peter was sent to do the work I requested. He did a quality job, in a timely manner and it was kept at a reasonable price (outbid 3 other companies). The employee I dealt with on the phone was also very knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend this company for all of your future plumbing jobs. Thank you 5-Star Plumbing and thank you Peter!<//review>

My water heater went out and it was about 20 years old so it was time for a new one. I had 3 companies come out and decided with 5 🌟. Peter came out and did the quote for us and was great to work with,They put us on the schedule for two days later. We decided to go for a heat pump to replace our old electric unit and SMUD gave us a $1000 cash rebate! Brandon came out for the install and he was professional and knew his stuff! Everything looks amazing! Thanks Brandon< /review>

5-Star is awesome. They did an excellent job of installing our new gas line and tankless water heater. This was a big job and done very professionally. It was also at about 50% of what others were quoting. Very single person I dealt with was responsive and knew about my project. Lastly one of our AC outlets was not working. I called and in less than 2 hours they had made the correction to reconnect the ducting that had been disconnected. All without fuss. Great customer support.< /review>

I would definitely recommend 5-Star Plumbing to anyone. We had clogged sink and disposal wasn't working the way it's supposed to, so i
called few companies including 5-Star Plumbing & i don't regret using this company.  They were here within an hour and got the job done fast. The guy that came was thorough with his job. After he fixed the problem, he called me and had me watch him test the sink n garbage disposal. He was very polite and very friendly too. He also cleaned up after his work was done.I couldn't pronounce the guy's name..all i know it starts with an N..and he said it's like Nazareth😀. Thank you Mr Naz and 5-Star Plumbing 👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏< /review>

The techs are very knowledgeable and friendly. My water main leaked during Christmas 2018 they had someone out in matter of hours. Work was completed professionally and on schedule. I was so happy with the work that I had them do other projects around the house.  Going forward these are my guys when it comes to plumbing needs.< /Review>

Brandon Flores was amazing and explained all the work, showed me where the problems were and why it needed to be done.  He also gave me options that fit my price range. This is after going with various other companies and I was given wrong information by one in particular.  I might add the other companies did not explain the problem to me and I was charged an exuberant price for just a drain inspection 3x of what I was charged by 5-star plumbing and nothing was fixed.  This made me apprehensive on even getting an estimate done, since I was worried about the price I was previously quoted. But all in all I could not be happier with the work done, after not having a working bathroom for over a month. The estimate I was given for the work was exactly what I was charged. They fixed and replaced the drains and in the tub, sink and toilet that were all leaking and put on badly by the previous owner of the home.  He was very kind and patient and even fixed the kitchen sink which only put out hot water for the last year. Any work that I need done in regards to plumbing I will definitely be going back to 5-star!  Thank you guys so much!</Review>

I had a clogged sink that did not respond to me using four different chemicals, cleaning out the trap, and using a 20-foot snake. Nazar came in, and was personable, diligent, persistent, and conscientious on the clean-up. It took over ninety minutes, but he would NOT give up until he solved the problem. I give my highest recommendation to Nazar and 5-Star. The flow is a go!</Text>

<review>If you have any type of plumbing issue, this is the place to call! I found them on Yelp with a full 5 stars out of 300+ reviews and knew I’d be taken care of. They scheduled my appointment at a time that was convenient for me and gave me a quote over the phone. The job ended up costing us a lot more than what we expected as we do not have a cleanout apparently. Brandon was our rep and he was extremely transparent about the process and pricing and went above and beyond to give us all options available to us, including his own recommendations that aligned with the other second opinions we got. They have to come back tomorrow to finish it but I am very happy thus far with the service provided by 5-Star. They were even nice enough to honor our 20% for checking in. Looking forward to getting this project finished with 5-Star!

Updated - Brandon came out today and finished the job, installed a cleanout and it took him half the time he initially quoted. We will definitely be using 5 Star for all of our future plumbing needs!! Thanks Brandon! Also, you left a stool here...<//review>< Pics>

< review>
We needed a full repipe done due to the old piping being notorious for leaking issues (Kitec). 5-star was the lowest bidder out of 4 plumbers we contacted. They got the job done in about 4 days, helped set up inspection, and did a rough patch (we did have to hire a painter for texture and paint). Plumbing works great. All the staff we were in contact with were courteous and friendly.

The inspector seemed to be impressed with their work. They also managed to do it with a minimum of dry wall removal. Other plumbers were talking about having to cut through the external stucco which would have been another thing needed to be redone aesthetically but the boys at 5-star managed to do the job without needing to do this. In fact, they ended up finishing under their original estimate! Overall, I am very satisfied with the experience. I would definitely call them again for any plumbing issues.</review>

<review>After having a very bad experience with another plumber I called this company because of the reviews. They did not disappoint! The first company came out 4 times and still left me with cold water. These guys sent two men out the same day and they had the problem fixed in less than two hours. They were polite, friendly, professional and knowledgeable. I really appreciate them coming out so quickly and fixing my water heater issues. In addition, they explained what the problem was and how to avoid it in the future. I highly recommend them.<//review><user_id>103232158394930606635</user_id><gmap_id>0x809b20ad1d0d65bf:0xa3f2214bbea28b92< /gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response></record>

One of our pipe lines going to the second floor was leaking, we called 5 Star Plumbing for a quote and they were very responsive to our calls. The next morning, they came to our house and repaired the leaking pipe. Plumbers they sent were professional and prompt with their work. Pricing was reasonable and we do recommend their services to everyone.<//text>

I've gone back to 5-Star for several emergencies and they've been amazingly fast, friendly, and for always less money than I fear. We recommend them to friends, and won't hesitate to call them again.<//Review>

<text>5-Star Plumbing was fantastic!

I had a clogged bathroom drain and I gave them a call. They answered the phone quickly and was able to schedule a same day fix

They sent over Vitally , who was very friendly and professional. He did the work in less than an hour.

I paid via credit card and the payment process was done on-site and was very simple.

I plan to call them again if I have any other problems in the future. I would highly recommend them To anyone else.<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I got a text alert in the morning, then the repairman Adam showed up exactly at 8, the service time.  I had a crack in my toilet, which needed replacing.   We hopped to a nearby Lowes, i bought a toilet and Adam had it installed by just past 9.  Seems very productive for an hour of work including shopping.

Adam was very polite and professional and answered all questions.  I would definitely use them again.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Worst plumber ever! Needed a drain fixed now I have two new leaks underneath my bathroom sink and the could not repair my shower and also have a new leaking shower. Tech spent over 6 hours and didn't do a good job 0/10 srtars and I even showed him half way through where it was leaking. Called them to come back out and they cancelled last min! Worst plumbers ever hands down do not use them and I'm a retired insurance agent from Farmers Insurance!!!!<//Review><Rate>1<//Rate><Gmap_id>0x809b20ad1d0d65bf:0xa3f2214bbea28b92</Gmap_id>< Name>

It was an excellent service they did. I called 5 Star Plumbing and Peter answered the call and he was also the one who did the plumbing works in our house. They came on time, and charge me, of what was quoted on the phone. Peter finished the plumbing works within half of the day.< /Text>

<Text>5 star came out to fix a puncture in a 1 inch Pex water pipe in the wall. The wall was open and all prepped and ready to just cut, add couplings and fitting. The two  workers were at my house for approximately 10 minutes. My bill was $290. This is ridiculous. However I needed it fixed so I paid the price.  I have had Armstrong plumbing come out to fix Pex lines in the past and they charged me $150 for the same exact job.  Unfortunately,  because Armstrong plumbing is so busy,  they couldn't get out to fix it until the following week. If you have time to wait,  which I did not,  call Armstrong Plumbing. SORRY 5-STAR. NO MORE BUSINESS FROM ME. This review is for price only. The work was done complete and professional.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>Our sink had a leak and I thought it was just a minor fix in which I can do on my own but it wasn’t. It was caused by two tubes not being properly connected. I called 5 Star Plumbing and their customer service was very responsive and they sent Joe. The fix took like less than an hour and the price was very reasonable. I'm glad the problem was resolved and I highly recommend this company to everyone.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I contacted 5 star plumbing after hours when I noticed a water leak in our front yard. Our water-heater started hissing and water was going all over the place. Paul came out and shut it off and drained it. He then scheduled an appointment to replace it the very next day. He and Oleg came out the next day and installed a new water-heater. They did a great job, it’s been a few days now and we’re very satisfied of their services. We would recommend them to anyone.< /Review>

Had a wonderful experience with 5 Star Plumbing. Oleg and Peter came out to install a new water heater in my house in Sac. Even though the process was long and tough as I live in an older home, they made it look very neat at the end. Very reasonable priced, would recommend.<//Text>

First i requested service to fix the simple water leak under the sink. After they fixed and left, tenant informed me that now there is a leak from the water heater. They insisted that it had nothing to do with what they fixed but they turned off the valve from the water heater to shut off the water. They requested additional $350 to fix the leak from waterheater which i regretly agreed to pay. Today they went back to fix the valve. Tenant informed me just now the waterheater is completly not working and service guys just left without even talking to her. I am shocked. I am filing complaints to the consumers affair and possibly make a lawsuit agsinst them.<//review>

This place will try to scam you the first phone call. Quotes are also double the price compared to surrounding competition. Avoid at all costs.</text>

<review>5 Star lives up to their name! After multiple estimates for a tankless installation, I am happy to chose 5 Star  Plumbing. They were not the cheapest but were very thorough from the first call till the end of the project. I am really happy with my new tankless and will be calling them in the future for other jobs. Highly recommend.</review>< Pics>

Tech Jack has one yr experience as he claimed that I needed a new thermostat, yet he was wrong. The actual diagnosis is that I need a TCouple assembly kit replaced. And, your co. wanted to charge me 156.00 for this visit which I was not forewarned of such at all. Thus, I refused to for pay for the tech's incorrect assessment.<//Text>

< Review>
So happy I chose these guys, they did a water heater tank to tankless water heater conversion for me, I felt like I can trust them from the beginning when Peter came out to provide me with an estimate, he did not try to up-sell me anything. Dimas and Max came out a few days later and performed the installation, all in one day! Passed inspection on first try. Really impressed with the honesty and quality work. Best plumbers I’ve ve had to deal with by far!<//Review>

I had a water heater leak, so I called 5-star plumbing. I talked to Peter and set up an appointment for the next day at 10 a.m. The next day a plumber by name Oleg shows up sharp at 9:00 a.m. This guy looked very neat, professional and was courteous. He took a look at my water heater and suggested to replace it. Thanks to him and his pleasant service now I have the tankless water system, I save energy. I am very pleased with 5-star plumbing services and hands down will do business again. I highly recommend them.</review>
