Great cycle shop. Small selection of bikes, but nice selection of accessories and awesome customer service. Service department is top notch. Picked up a pair of comfortable riding gloves without having to ride 25 miles to get them. Happy to support local San Clemente businesses.< /Text>

Very friendly staff, prices are a little high, but they have all the basics covered.  The mechanics are good but I would not trust them with technical repairs.  I bought my tires there and they said they would mount them for free, but charged 5 bucks to take the wheels off.  I thought that was a cheap shot.  Then they some how got air in my front brake line.  Took it back and the same thing.  That is why I would not trust them with technical work. I give them three stars because they are average.  Not bad but not great.</review>

One stop shop. They have everything and more. Super friendly and above all, reliable. There just aren't any other shops like this around. Bottom line, if you ride, they have what you need.
Dont forget the golden rule...Enjoy< /Text>

<review>I have been to many motorcycle shops all over the world, Finally I moved back to the area 2 years ago and found everything I need from SC Rider Supply when it comes to my two wheeled children. This places makes you feel right at home,   They Honor and  Love their Service Veterans, their Community and Customers. Rick and Roxanne are beyond what a motorcycle business owner Truly  Represents.  They take care of their customers,  They are straight forward and honest as well as all the staff there. I recommend this place to everyone needing anything MOTO.<//review>< pics>

My poor old bikes starter went out two weeks later( old bike problems) and I brought it to them to fix it and they tried but the old yeller was just done with 😭😭. They didn't charge me for the days of hour they must have put in to try and fix it. Like I said great honest guys. Would give 10 stars if I could.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I had a lot of issues and had to go back 3 times to get everything correct. It took a lot of extra messing around but everything was resolved in the long run.
The rushed the job so everything was loose and parts were missing and incorrect.
They ordered all the correct parts and are sending them to me now and I feel as though we reached an amicable solution.
I'm 50/50 now staff is nice but definitely shouldn't have been this difficult.<//review>

<Text>What sets this place apart from every other bike shop is the affable nature of each and every person you meet here. I know other riders out there know what I'm talking about when you go into a bike service shop and they make you feel like you are just lucky to be there.
Not here. You get a name and a handshake from each person you meet, the mechanics are knowledgable and dont give you grief if your a noob.

The prices are fair and the work is done without excess services being pushed. I cannot say how highly I reccomend these people and their business.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I dont usually write these bad type of reviews. But they ruined my zx10r by recommending me to do something for hundreds of dollars and letting the bike super shaky, wobbling all over the place very dangerous, I remember how the owner after I told him how the bike was going he literally said: "nah thats alright" and I thought, well thats alright for you cause you got the money but I got a very wobbly and dangerous bike (this was literally minutes after he worked on it). So disrespectful, he said: "pfff, give me the bike, I'll try it" and went to test it and instead of recognizing the issue he told me again: "its ok" I couldnt belive it!!!! Even the other guys who were working there notice the problem cause this other fella took it for a ride because i didnt want to keep his "its ok" and kill myself. And this kid told me what happened that they broke when doing what he recommended me and left the bike very bad that needed to be replace with a new one and of course that I did it in DreamsMotorcycle up north a couple of miles.

I will never forget this. That day I spent 673 dollars and I am not exaggerating (cause they suggest it) and brake fluids (that last was good). I'll never forget his manners. Cant remember his name. Owner. But Roxanna was very nice.

I just think they just want money and not really worry about you.

Worst experience I've had in a mechanic. I just had to write it somewhere. He should learn some manners and be nice with people, specially when you screw up a bike that you suggested working on.

Sorry but I had to write this. So hopefully next time you treat a client nicer and better than with me. Cause I do care of my life riding my motorcycle, not like you. Thats really what it made me feel.< /Review>

It was wonderful up until the young man who was helping me left and an older man came upstairs to "help" me. From the moment he walked in he was extremely rude and sexist observing me because obviously since I happen to be female I don't know what I'm doing. I was specifically looking at the mesh jackets looking and feeling the protectors and seeing if I could figure out what they are made of so I could possibly dye one in the future. He was looking down on me and when he noticed I kept looking over stuff more than once to be sure he acted very hostile. Obviously this is a man's store and only men are welcome. I loved the store up until that man came in. If you're trying to gather information and happen to be female I would try somewhere else. But if you  see a young man inside, I would definitely visit because though the  older man was horribly rude the young man was kind and answered my questions with a smile. Over all it was okay but I personally don't think I'll be coming back to this store anytime soon. But if you're a man this is probably the perfect store for you.</Text>

<review>Long time costomer here. No returns and no price matching, but I don't come here for bargains. Got valves adjusted on crf250x costed normal and they did good, got my tires changed on same and it costed &45 each cause I have tubbliss and they changed my intertubes without asking at $20 extra, bought a $150 oring chain and they said they'd crimp the master link once I installed it and I did then when I brought it back they over crimped it and crushed the O-ring and when I brought it back a week later they told me it was because I did not maintain the chain well and then they put another Link in there and overcurrent it again and then I asked for someone else to do it. Older mechanic is great he did it right the first time and I got it back no problem. I had my girlfriend pick it up< /review>< Date>

<Review>I've been using them for years and will continue. They are open everyday and with my schedule thats important. Great staff that are always ready to help and answer questions. Tire prices are excellent and free mounting if you take the tire off. I washed all my bikes yesterday and I haven't been riding the super moto much lately so I drained the gas. Rode it to the gas station and noticed the clip for the master link was missing, Scary. I putted it over to their shop(On A Sunday)(On Any Sunday!) and Rick hooked me up with a clip and popped it on for me. They had a guy there that was dropping his Cruiser off for service. Roxanne was going to give him a ride home! Now thats service and thats why I only go there!!!!!!!!! Thank you Rick and Roxanne.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcf46f2d049b5f:0x190d3495a02504e6<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>Absolutely horrible experience.  I wouldn't refer anyone to this company. Not only is the pricing extremely outrageous, the owner and employees are very un-professional.

I got in they did urine blood started IV and gave me medication and got my testing done. All the staff was great if I could remember my nurses name he was great and I definitely would accommodate him. I went to other ER’s before and this one was better than them and I just appreciate the fact that they didn’t leave me laying in a bed for hours they actually checked in d the doctor listened to me and I’m just very pleased.</review><user_id>116884524072023937804<//user_id><Rate>5</Rate>< Response>

From the minute the security guard screened me (took temp. and asked the COVID-19 questions) to the minute I left I feel like this ER has the greatest staff. When I got checked in the desk nurse was friendly and kind.  The Nurse Stephanie assigned to me was the same. The phlebotamist joked and worked as a team with the nurse. I felt cared for and respected. The doctor was just the same with her bedside manner.  I overheard conversions with social workers for an intoxicated man and she was engaging and kind to him as well. A toddler needed to be checked and they managed to ease her cries and fears.  I would highly recommend this hospital ER if heaven forbid you should need one!</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Dr. Prince,

You are a horrible, shaming doctor.

My daughter brought in her baby for an exam. She had the flu and Dr. Prince told my daughter that she was a “bad mom” and berated her for not giving her a flu shot. Short, nasty, mean man - a bully. Mockingly questioned her about immunisations (which she gives her child).

Chief of Staff is obviously ignoring the reviews around this doctor. Inappropriate, unprofessional and a liability. I’m going to follow up expecting action.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Brought in my daughter for an emergency visit to the hospital. we were seen by Dr. Prince, which in turn led to one of the worst hospital visits I have ever been to. Extremely apathetic, condescending, and rude.  The facility was super dirty, with blood stains on the floor, as well as bloody needle tubes. We waited for 3 hours before any tests were even initiated. Please avoid this hospital at all costs. If you have any emergency, check out an urgent care facility instead. One that is rated, and cares about public opinion.</review>

The hospital is under construction,  the emergency room which is makeshift, was a bit crowded with only one physician on a weekday morning 7 am. I think that Intake staff members need a course in how to receive and direct patients in a warm friendly manner. After all, healthcare is exorbitantly expensive and people have many choices. I would not recommend anyone going to the emergency room due to the disorder and indifference of the intake staff.

The only reason I would not give the hospital a ONE star is because of the wonderful care by Dr. Solomon who had the best bedside manner of anyone I have met in my 68 year life. He listened to everyone and was calm even though he was very busy. He is an outstanding care giver.<//Text>

< Review>
Horrifying almost deadly experience. I brought my 8 year old hear because he had a rash on his chest. They quickly said he had chickenpox and sent us away with Tylenol. He has had all his vaccinations. A few hours later his rash spread to cover his chest face and shoulders so back to Tarzana we went. At that point they then said they had no clue what it was. They admitted us and then spent the next 2 days testing my son for random things, taking X-rays, taking blood twice a day. They literally tried to start an iv 4 different times on my 8 year old. His sheets were covered in blood and he was horrified. His fever kept spiking up to 104, I asked them to put him on a schedule of Motrin or Tylenol so this doesn’t happen. Next time I checked my son he had a 105. At that point it had been 2 days and I saw the doctor twice and got ZERO answers. I asked to them be transferred to children’s hospital in la so my son could receive the care he needed because we still didn’t know what’s wrong. The DOCTOR TOLD ME NO, she said it would take FOREVER To transfer us IN FRONT OF MY 8 YEAR OLD CHILD and she also told me she wouldn’t sign my son out so we could take him to children’s hospital ourselves. I then asked her to immediately leave the room and I told her she was a horrible doctor. I demanded an AMA release against medical advice, we rushed my son to children’s la and had a diagnosis and had him started on medicine within 6 hours of arriving at children’s hospital. Long story short, THIS HOSPITAL IS A DEATH TRAP. THEY WILL KEEP YOUR CHILDREN THERE AND NOT GIVE THEM PROPER CARE SO THEY CAN COLLECT YOUR INSURANCE MONEY. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BRING YOUR CHILD TO PROVIDENCE TARZANA IF YOU WANT THEM TO SURVIVE THEIR ILLNESS.</Review>

The stuff were so helpful and considerate to me. It wasn't  a long wait comparing to other ER in Los Angeles.  They make sure every patient gets taken care of. And the doctors work as fast as they can.< /Text>

<Review>This is a hospital that we've been coming for the last 25 plus years as a family from emergency room to different floor and sections.
I'm admitred here for a surgery that I had. I was going to clear liquid diet and now I'm at full liquid diet. did you know they don't even use real beef or chicken broth not even the liquid one . They use  powder. It made me sick knowing how much  they charge daily to insurance companies, yes that's how they're saving money on the construction.

<review>The doctors here are the worst. Also, they don't quarantine MRSA or staph patients since my best friend shared a room with an elderly man being treated for multiple things including I giant staph wound on his leg. Now maybe this doesn't seem like a big deal to the average person or because my best friend is not high risk, but unfortunately, I am I risk and I've come down with a severe infection in the past 48 hours. Also, maybe the nurses should take a course in phlebotomy so his arms don't look like a heroin addict with tracks running down them. Absolutely appalled at the disregard for safety at this Hospital. Also it would be great if your staff didn't discuss their alcoholism in front of patients.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c299a7e92260d1:0x41aa39453cbf174b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I came in there with my mom last night 3/27. It wasn’t as busy but there was plenty going on . I think people really don’t appreciate  ER workers. We rush in , spent a lot of time waiting for our loved ones , then when we finally get to go home , we just want to get the hell out of there. So I just wanted to say that from the friendly security trying to get us in ASAP , the nurse that took my call and then later let me cut through line because my mom really looked bad , the nurse taking her vitals, the nurses that took her vitals the second time, everyone who helped her when she got a room ( I didn’t go in because of the 1 person time) thank you!!!< /Review>< pictures>

There's no patient privacy while checking in.
The curtains in the rooms have poop and blood stains on them. The worst part is that it's so dirty, and there are mosquitos. I got bit all over my ankles and legs and spent my time swatting mosquitos away. Run!!!< /Text>

My son had an emergency apendectomy performed at this hospital. After surgery he had a bad case of diarhea which led to frequent restroom trips, he didn't rest much nor did I as I was the one helping him to the restroom and tending to him. On the third night we were there, a nurse came in at 4:45am and told me that they would be moving us to a "bigger room" which we had never complained about the size of the current room. Five minutes later they came and took my son to a room that housed 2 patients. I asked why we had to be moved and another nurse said that they needed the room for another patient. It was clear tbat was the agenda from the beginning but chose to lie instead. They knew my son constantly gets up to use the RR, and thiis was not only an incoveniece to us but to the patient we now shared the new room with. This same group of nurses not once came to ask how my son was doing from the time their shift began. I only saw them a few times when they came to change his IV meds. I come from a patient care background at a hospital and know the importance of patient care and satisfaction, there was total disregard of either.<//Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>The emergency room was moved to a small 10x10 room. Patient examination beds are right next to each other. There is no privacy. Other patients can see your body and hear your private medical information. There is no way for a doctor or nurse to give proper medical care. It was loud, disorganized and wall to wall people in a small room. Parking is limited due to  construction. A few weeks after my surgery. I was pushed out before I felt well. I did not get discharge papers so I did not know what to do. Very inadequate uncaring employees. Very bad experience.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c299a7e92260d1:0x41aa39453cbf174b< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>Providence Tarzana Hospital has good ER doctors and equipment reviving my dad from bad pneumonia caused by substandard rehab facilities like West Valley Rehab and Tarzana Rehab but their regular discharge doctor, Dr. Robin Zakariaei, was very quick in discharging my dad back to the same rehabs facilities without proper medications.  My dad almost died twice due to their uncaring process!<//Review>< pictures>

Did not sufficiently relieve my severe pain that I had when I severely sprained my ankle. They gave me 600mg of ibuprofen which my stomach is sensitive to. I asked for tramadol which is a scheduled IV opioid pain medication. The doctor there quickly refused my offer and I left with ibuprofen pill that will eventually cause stomach bleeding and ulcers. Tramadol is a weak opioid and the addition is at a low compared to Vicodin which is a Scheduled II opioid medication.< /Review>

<rating>2<//rating><text>Susie Prasad is the worst worker in the medical records office, she was super rude! She was yelling from her office to where I was sitting outside as if I would answer her. Why would I want to yell back and not talk to her properly? I waited till she came to where she seated me and she kept saying Hello! Hello! She made me walk out of her office twice saying “ go sit outside” not even a please. She kept trying to correct what I was trying to tell her. She didn’t want to give me the records since I wasn’t the one asked for them, yet they were MY RECORDS. I explained to her and she finally listened and gave them to me. She has no type of customer service as I walked in she told me can’t you see I’m in break, the time said on the paper had already passed so she was lieing.<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
I came in on a very quiet easter sunday afternoon. i suffered  minor cuts while preparing a meal for my family. I could not get the bleeding to stop. I was brought in promptly. Unfortunately, my experience went downhill from there. The physician, Dr. Moy, was abrupt,  rude, short, and uncaring. He literally said "I don't have time for this"...I plan on calling the emergency supervisor to discuss this. I have plenty of choices for health care. This  jerk needs to recognize he is in the healthcare industry, not a plumber...< /review>

Horrible experience in the ER. My two month old was sick and they didn’t pay attention, it took then two hour to notice that we were just sitting in the hall way and they kept telling us the a bed was going to be ready and never happen. The staff is unorganized with a rush of people coming in. Unprofessional people working there and to make it even worse they wanted to discharge us with even going through protocal of check on the baby and give her medication. Then they told us to wait outside in the admitting room. For this being a hospital they don’t take childern as a priority. Seem they they are more of a business and money hungry. Will never come back to Provedance  Tarzana or recommend anyone to this unprofessional hospital.<//review>

I have been going to Don Roberto's in El Monte for over 10 years and the reason for that is not only the quality of products but the quality of service! They have truly treated me like family over the last 10 years with.

Lulu , Carlos and Laura have always gone above and beyond on how they have taken care of any request I may have. They have also come up with some of the best custom job ideas on jewelry I've gotten over the years. Laura pierced my daughters ears and now loves to see how she's grown over the years. Lulu always has the most patience with me as she knows how long it takes for me to decide on what I want, hours sometimes! Carlos is always willing to stop and talk with me on  how the family is doing and always seems to find a way work deals out with me when he sees me eyeing more than one item.

Anna and Lety are the best with my daughter! My daughter has gotten to know them when I  come by to pay my bill or just say hi. They sit with her to color if I am shopping for something new so I can focus on that or let her run to collect all the balloons

I can't say enough nice things about this team and will continue to be a customer at the El Monte location for years to come!<//text>

Had the best experience at Don Robertos, El Monte!  Joanna was super helpful in assisting me with picking out my anniversary band.  Everyone was super friendly!  I felt like I was shopping with family! Pricing was good and so was the selection. I will def be back for all my jewelry needs!</Text>

wow!! my husband went in to get hes watch repaired. The hinge got unlatched. He was hesitant because he thought they would charge him an arm and leg just to get it fixed. lol.. and he came in out in 5 minutes and it was FREE!!!. He forgot to get the lady's name.  She was going super nice.  But he was extremely happy with service.  Thank you Don Roberto!!< /Review>

< review>
My gf and I went in yesterday knowing we wanted to buy something but not exactly what. We had the pleasure of having Ana show us around the different chains they had. I had so many questions and Ana was very attentive to what I wanted/was looking for. She showed me everything that I asked to look at with no hesitation. She also switched up different pendants with different chains to see which one I liked better. She made my visit very comfortable and I left with some more knowledge in jewlery. I wanted to leave with 3 different options but I didn't know if I'd have enough to leave with 3 or 2 of the 3 options. Ana was kind enough to add up the totals for the two items I wanted or the 3 to see a price difference. As soon as I seen the price I was satisified and ended up leaving with 3 items. 😊 The lady who helped us with the application process (i have already purchased here before but because of some edits I had to make kn my account we had to redo an application whic wasn't long at all) Maggie was also very sweet and helpful. My girlfriend and I left vety satisfied and will definetly be reccomending Don Robertos to our friends and family as well as we will be going back very soon! 😊<//review>

<text>The ring my BF gave me which said to be 10k gold turned out to be less than 4K. I realized something was wrong when my finger started turning green. Went back to exchange because I thought it was probably a mistake. Chose a different 10k gold ring. Before even putting it on we went to a pond shop so they could check if it was 10k,  and once again it wasn't even close to 10k. My BF decided to go back to the store. Spoke to the manager.  She didn't want to void the contract but then later spoke to her "manager"  and ended up voiding the contract.  She wanted to give us store credit for the down payment My BF gave but i mean are you kidding me?!! What makes you think I wanna still buy from you. She then later said we were going to get all our money back.

We went to another small jewerly store and we told them about our experience. this man told us that Don Roberto's always takes their jewelry to them so they could fix it. He also said they they've tested their jewerly themselves and it's bad quality.

this company is committing fraud and charging triple the prize. Do not buy from them.</text>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1497886273084, 'text': "Hello Jasmine, It's unfortunate that you weren't happy with our product but we don't appreciate you lying and trying to defame our company. There is no way that our gold is turning your finger green or showing that low on the acid test. Pawn shops will always tell you that jewelry quality is lower than the actual quality, they are trying to pay you as little as possible so that they can resell it for more, this is not a viable source. All our jewelry is purchased by the most reliable vendors in the industry and all are stamped at 10k and 14k. If you need to speak with someone at corporate regarding this please email us at support@donrobertojewelers.com."}</response>< gmapID>

Awesome and helpful Butchers are on duty with the finest cuts of meat. Best Produce section with the freshest fruits and vegetables to choose from. The Deli will make you a delicious sandwich or help you by cutting your favorite lunch meats and cheeses to whatever thickness you prefer. The Bakery always has a fine selection of cakes, pies and pastries if your craving the sweets. There is even coffee (and I believe teas) if you need a little perking up ;)</Text>

Only 1 strange thing happened here one time: A Fish Tale.
I bought some salmon and it seemed a bit "fishy," tough, and a brighter color. I wonder if the meat department mis-labeled steelhead trout as salmon. I'm sure it was on accident if so.</Review>< Pics>

Waited 15 mins at the Peet’s to grab a ‘quick’ coffee.. asked for someone to come help me twice and had about 10 workers walk past me, look at me and keep going. I ended up leaving.. I had to settle and drove to the Starbucks across the street and literally got my coffee in 5 mins.< /Text>

I've been shopping here for 30 years and always liked this store, but now I love it! Today one of my bags didn't get in the cart with me, and I didn't discover it until I got home. I was hot and tired, and just didn't want to go back to the store. Lori from the office delivered it to me!!! Thank you so much Lori. Bel Air, you are lucky to have an employee like Lori.</text>

It was an enjoyable shopping trip.  I was picking something up for Valentine's.  I'll picked out a small potted rose bush.  I think it was a mini rose bush.  They had a great selection of cards.  I picked out a peanuts card.<//review>

This is my go to grocery store.  Great staff, decent selection, plenty of parking...the only reason I can't give it a 5 star is that the store is tiny and the rows are tight.  Shy of rebuilding it there is nothing they can do, but I think it adds some character.</Review>

This store needs a make over from top to bottom. Some of their sister stores showcase great pre-made meals, wide selection of fresh produce and a greater diversity of general goods. This store does not provide any of that and is limited across the board. The layout is odd and not inviting of a great experience like the sister stores. The staff are friendly though.</Text>

Very nice and always going out of their way to help or meet the needs of their customer. One particular incident I was short a quarter and the cashier pulled out her bill fold and said don't worry about a thing honey. I did give her a compliment in her tattoos and eyes before all this but still. Amazing staff<//Review>

<time>1504153063177</time><text>This is a very nice place to shop. Nearly every employee has been genuinely nice and helpful. They seem to do a great job in hiring the right kind of people to deal with the public.
The store is laid out nicely and the specialty departments (Meat, Deli, Produce, Bakery & more) have high quality foods.
Their pricing is about average compared to other markets like them. As I'm very cost conscious, I can't do the majority of my food shopping here. The fact that I do shop here is down to the convenience to where I live and the overall quality. They do a fantastic job!</text>< Name>

< Review>
Such a great neighborhood market!  May not be the biggest, newest or fanciest store in the chain but what they lack in that capacity they more than make up for by their friendly and professional service.
They have employees that have been in that one store for over 30 years.
While I’ve never had a bad experience at the store their are those employees that go out of their way to help....and over time develop a real relationship.
Biggest shoutout to Tami, Dolly, Lori, Su and Christopher (Sean 😊)!<//Review>

I bought coffee and doughnuts
The coffee was totally cold. When I asked the cashier about it she said “you want to wait for the fresh one”. I found her a white arrogant lady
She didn’t say I’m sorry or anything and this is wrong< /Review>

I wouldn't hear a couple of days before Thanksgiving and my credit card didn't work on account of their system was down so the manager had let me have my turkey for free! It was truly a blessing.< /Review>

The Bel Air staff are always friendly and pleasant to interact with. The store is kept clean, the parking lot is well maintained and the shelves are almost always stocked. Everyone is helpful - the employees know the store layout.<//review>

< Review>
A little to be desired first thing in the morning (7:30am). Some of the staff are unhelpful yet others make up for it, the deli counter is slow in the morning and takes a long time so if you're in a rush, either give it a miss and grab a bear claw (delicious from here) or get there 15 minutes earlier. Other than that, great Belair store</Review>

< Review>
Could these folks just get past the old Sacramento elites' objections and just update this place?  Yeah, they'll grumble, but seriously this place is so outdated it looks yellow inside, and every time their deli cooks chicken, the smell of burning oil fills the store.  They should knock the building down and start again.< /Review>

Although one of our closest neighborhood markets we usually go just a few blocks further for better pricing. When one store sells the same carton of milk for a full dollar more, which one would you go to?😎<//review>

<Review>For Thanksgiving, 2013, I ordered a complete turkey dinner from this Bel Air at a cost of about $60 for my friend and me.   The pictures in the brochure of it and the other choices, such as rack of lamb, looked wonderful.  The Bel Air staffer who took my order told me all that was necessary was to warm everything up for an hour and a half and dinner would be ready.  Therefore, my friend and I were shocked to find the stuffing, which was minimal and tasteless, had to be mixed with a bag of liquid and a bag of celery and also placed in the over.   The directions said we should put a meat thermometer in the turkey to watch for 325 degrees,   We wondered why this would be necessary, since we didn't have one and weren't told we needed one, but at the end of the "warm-up" period, when I tried to slice the turkey, it was tough and pink in the center!   There was a limp sack of plain mashed potatoes, a sack of plain gravy, a small sack of cranberry apple, and a pumpkin pie.  No vegetable, no salad, no yams.   It was an unpleasant surprise to both of us that the Raley's organization would do such a poor job!</Review>< Pictures>

Great little community / volunteer / co-op run shop, decent selection for a small book store these days. They seem to do a very good job featuring local and outstanding new publications.</review>

I've been buying books at this store since 1991, when I lived on Albion Street. In addition to selling great books, this book store is all about fostering a community.  Without a doubt, one of the reasons San Francisco is still a city worth living in.<//Review>

<Text>They have a wonderful selection of books and lots of art going on all the time. It’s all community center actually — for arts and music. There’s regular concerts and other events. It’s actually largely run by volunteers now which is a measure of how much of a strong community they have and how much people love it.

Great store, amazing selection and super helpful staff. I mean it. I'm used to walking into small bookstores just to be ignored by pretentious horn-rimmed intellectuals, but the staff here were not only extremely nice and knowledgeable, but worked very hard to help me find what I was looking for. I would have come in just for the conversation we had about the books I was buying.<//Text>

If you're looking for a classic or even if you're not, the selection is great, and the way the shop is set up makes it really easy to find what you're looking for. The staff is wonderful and friendly, and the space is really cozy. There are a couple of places to sit, too. Decent prices for not-too-worn secondhand books.</review>< Pictures>

I love that I found this real book store via an artists mural in the mission district. I love art, I love the city, and I especially love meaningful graffiti. 5 star's for being such a great place that an artist would want to recreate it and kudos to the artist for being so accurate with the details that I immediately found it</Text>

Pretty small. Knowledgeable staff. Mind widening selection.
Sometimes will be missing a specific book, but you'll always find something to interest you.< /text>

Very nice.  They had live music.  I bought a couple of sci-fi books I've been meaning to read.  Lots of bars and restaurants near by.<//text>

<text>Adobe Books is a longstanding SF hub for artists, vagabonds, and the curious. With over 25 years in the Mission, they've fostered a diverse community of collaborators and supporters who stood with the establishment when they were on the verge of being obliterated from map.

Though I miss their original spot on 16th Street, the new location is much easier to navigate. Lingering encouraged, so grab a seat and read, make new friends, and support!</text>< Pics>

Adobe Book Shop has moved to 24th Street, for your continued enjoyment. They may soon regain the musty clutter we knew and loved. Don't forget to wander to the art space in the rear.<//Review>

<Review>Found what we needed. Staff wasn't helpful. Two staff members saw that I kept searching and searching for a particular pant size and all they did was gossip. I tried asking for help, but the gossip was more important.< /Review><user_id>117057758951767807963<//user_id><gmap_id>0x80dd2d744d5c8335:0xf6831b308bdaa890</gmap_id><Time>1611025326373<//Time>< rate>

Women’s clearance section was a mess with multiple items on the floor.

Bad experience. Will be going to other express stores now.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dd2d744d5c8335:0xf6831b308bdaa890</Gmap_id><rate>1< /rate><response>None<//response></record>

Attended a celebration of life event in the area. In-house DJ was very responsive and alert during the whole event. The event accommodated at least a hundred people with no problems.

Bonus: They have a bar inside too and would allow non-members to purchase alcohol.< /text>

Easy parking, clear loudspeaker instructions for COVID protocol for the Chinese restaurant, easily accessible off the freeway, great views of the mountains and best of all, the best smoothie place around in the Juice It Up shop.

The employees here are hands down the nicest, sweetest people I've met in a very long time. They make excellent smoothies and send you out with a smile. There's a stuffed full community bulletin board by the entrance advertising pretty much anything you could need.  Definitely a must when you're in the area!<//review>

Excellent customer service. Got into a car accident back in January and my insurance gave me options for repair facilities. I chose caliber and I wasn't disappointed. They communicated with me the whole time, walked me through the process I had to go through and made sure everything was understood before I left everything in their capable hands.</review>

<user>111130083116916045049< /user><text>My vehicle wasn’t ready on time and they pushed it back multiple times part kept not fitting or they weren’t delivered on time. Then when I gave permission to inspect the whole vehicle not just the external damage, there was an increase in repairs from 2 thousand dollars to 7 thousand. When they returned the vehicle they didn’t even tighten up all the screws and didn’t bother placing my battery lock back on. The vehicle was a mile until empty in gas. It isn’t priority for them but for a service that expensive you would think they would at least help me out with that.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

My car trunk and bumper were replaced. Paint don't match. Scratches on the trunk in the new paint. Scratches on my doors that were not there when the car was checked in. Trunk out of adjustment. Not satisfied with the service I received from the shop. The guy who did the estimate was very professional and so was office staff. Will not recommend to others!< /text>

<text>We had an EXCELLENT experience at Caliber Collision. A beautiful job was done and in a timely manor by the body shop team. Their communication and overall customer service was something special, I have never experienced anywhere else. Rita, and Caliber Collision went above and beyond our expectations taking care of our needs and were so understanding to our cituation. Trey picked up and dropped off our vehicle and was very thorough, taking every precaution in keeping us all safe during this pandemic. Caliber Collision stands out above the rest. I highly recommend Caliber Collision, and plan on using them for my future automotive needs.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>My back passenger window stopped working on my 2011 Jeep and a friend recommended Caliber Collision. I had seen the sign many times but thought that they only specialized in bigger jobs. I spoke to the manager, Rita who assured me I would be happy with their work. I was scheduled in the next day and they fixed my window in record time. I received excellent customer service from the moment I contacted them. I was pleasantly surprised at how quick they took care of my window & even had my Jeep washed & vacuumed for me when I picked it up. Very professional and friendly staff so, Caliber will now be my go-to auto shop if the need should arise again!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

< review>
First came here a few days after I got rear ended on freeway. At first it was through my insurance triple as a. Got a estimate of 2500. For repairs. I said I was waiting for person who rear enede me insurance to get police report. So finally there insurance took full responsibility for accident. So I decided to put claim through her insurance which is state farm. So happens caliber does work for them too. So agreed on a date to bring in for repairs. New estimate for state farm was 2000. From what they could see. I was supposed to get emailed a detailed new esimate for my approval once broken apart but no revised estimate never came until 1 your before I picked up my truck. Estimate was 6,700.00 . if I knew it was that much I would be had a family friend do work. Also they were giving updates on the finish date but got a call 1 hpur before they closed saying it wouldn't be done till Monday and Monday came no call. So Tuesday I had insurance company call them finally got to pick up today. But after I had to cancels some jobs and lost waged for 3 days because truck I was having repaired is my business work truck. They need a little better communication with customers . I wouldn't recommend them<//review>

When my car got totaled, assessor said it could be fixed, but looking at it you can tell the unibody got hit hard. Weeks later insurance said they couldn't repair it as it would cost more than the value.

The staff were very friendly and helpful except for the fact that it took them almost a month to notify my insurance company that my minivan was totaled. They made promises about timelines they did not keep.</Review>

<Time>1498587692081<//Time><rate>1<//rate><text>I am very disappointed in the quality of workmanship that was done to my vehicle. My vehicle was in and out of this location for about 3 1/2 months and my car is now being sent to another body shop to have the repairs completed and redone.

In the beginning, I was getting phone calls as to when I was able to go pick up my vehicle because it was done. Once a time and date was scheduled, I would receive a phone call that the car was in fact not completed.

There was dirt in the paint as well as orange peel throughout the vehicle. The body was not aligned, shrinkage in the paint, headlight lenses where buffed and eventually had to be replaced. The gas door was not aligned, then was not able to be opened and then eventually replaced as well. The hood had to be replaced due to a spot of paint shrinkage. miscellaneous parts were lost and had to be replaced.

the last attempt to allow this company to correct their work was a big mistake! I was told that it would only be a couple of weeks in the shop. well almost 2 months later, my vehicle was rushed out of the shop because I asked the shop to rent me a vehicle for the remaining amount of time that they would have it due to no longer having my other vehicle available to me. I had the rental (3rd row at my request because of 4 kids under the age of 12) I was then told that my car was complete and needed to be picked up because the boss needed to return my car back to me because i was in a rental at their expense for a week already.

I was asked to go over the vehicle and get back to them if there was any problem. the following day I noticed that they chevy emblem on the grill had fallen off, the in side panel of the doors and truck were glued back together and now falling apart. some paint was chipped off.

I had emailed caliber asking how to move forward with have the paint addressed and I was told, "i got the pictures, thanks"

it has been beyond upsetting not being able to have my car fixed correctly. My insurance (STATE FARM) recommended this place the day my vehicle was vandalized and I had trusted a company that was this big to be able to handle this kind of job. This is their job to repair auto body work.

we have involved the regional manager as well with this situation early on. unfortunately this was not of any help.

I will never recommend this company to anyone ever.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Best asada tacos! The meat was tender and full of flavor (not too greasy) and the best part: the tortillas are made right before your eyes as you order! They offer a variety of salsas and you can get guacamole at no extra charge! The horchata was the perfect blend of sweetness and flavor.
Excellent customer service and welcoming, clean location. The owner and his employees are very friendly and attentive to your needs.
They have discounts for Cal Poly and Mt. SAC students.
I will definitely be going back!<//review>

This place is amazing. The refríes beans are great for the burrito and the black beans and white rice are perfect for the bowls. I definitely recommend coming here. It’s like chipotle but it’s real Mexican food< /Review>

We found this place by accident but love it.  The food is fresh.  Tortillas made fresh on the spot.  Beef is top notch.  Service reminds me of the "Soup Nazi" on Seinfeld.  After entering the door, make sure you promptly get in line,  decide how many tacos you want and let the lady know when asked (because she will only make the tortilla fresh and to order) then decide quickly what meat you want and clearly tell the lady/man when asked, then move along the counter to the condiments,  then again be clear and precise about what you want on your tacos, then move to the cashier to pay.  If they are really busy , you will probably won't see any smiles. But the owner, sometimes come around and say hi.  Overall, very efficient process.  So worth a visit, especially on Tuesdays.  Honest reviewer.<//Text>

< Review>
Absolutely amazing I was reluctant since it didn't look to authentic but to my surprise it is and a healthier alternative to greasier tacos with two tortillas. Meat is great quality and not too salty perfectly seasoned, tortillas are made fresh to order and they actually have a bigger salsa and almost salad bar since they have fine cabbage, lettuce and great guacamole that actually is real you can see and taste the avocados and not all the other stuff they typically add. Plenty of lemons and carrots in escabeche. Tuesday tacos are on sale or a taco plate for $5.99 with your choice of beans and rice. I suggest the black beans and white rice. And plenty of cold plain water!</Review>

This place was great! Very friendly staff and delicious food. They also have VEGAN options!! Will definitely return. Their habanero salsa was so good, super spicey, would recommend getting it on the side. Their refried beans are also super good, they add spices to them.< /review>

Everything is fresh. Handmade tortillas. Great delicious food, great service, best fish tacos in town. Wet burritos. Tacos. And you must try the habanero sauce. Too spicy? Their horchata is the best. I drive all over LA. This place is by far the best.</text>

Vegan taco is a nice option to have, but this one has no actual vegetables. They fill the taco with a super salty meat substitute. Its main flavor is salt.  Otherwise friendly fast service.</review>

Today, I had a Beyond Beef Burrito and it was AWESOME! I've eaten there before and will continue. I'm glad they have a meat alternative for those of us that are trying to make the switch from meat to no meat. Give them a try. You won't regret it.<//text>

Chiles rellenos are not made with queso fresco. I was told they were.  Very nice attitude from servers. Very friendly and engaging.</text>

Good tacos at a decent price.  Come here on Tuesdays for taco tuesday deal ($1.49 ea)!  Staff is friendly.  Weird hours for Fridays as they close when it gets dark.  Wish they were open on the weekends too.</text>

I usually get the wet burrito with both sauces. But you can even order off menu. If you can think it, he'll try to make it. For the spicy lovers, his habanero sauce will kick you in the a.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I've eaten here about eight-or-nine times now on my lunch breaks and every meal has been superb, as well as the customer service. Each meal has tasted amazing. They really do have fresh and quality ingredients. It can seem a bit on the pricier end (around $8.00 for a burrito), but it is money well spent. It's great portions without being excessive (like a Chipotle burrito), so you don't feel stuffed and gorged afterward. Also, they have great veggie options - the substitute beef and chicken are just as flavorful as the meat counterparts. I highly recommend giving this place a try.</Text>

My new favorite taco spot. They are a Chipotle style restaurant but with authentic Mexican style. Except for the the pastor, it is made with beef instead of pork but is so good. their refried beans are delicious. And the habenero salsa is super good but super spicy. Try at your own risk. So much flavor in their meats. Fish tacos are awesome. Nothing bad yo day about this place except that I wish it was closer to my house and they were open on weekends.< /review>

I tried the al pastor, carne asada and the chicken for my taco plate and they were great. My favorite meat would have to be the carne asada. I wanted to have a kick with my tacos, so I chose the habanero sauce for all three. The sauce is super hot, but it's so good!< /Text>< date>

< review>
It was a very good Mexican restaurant, a long ways better than say Chipotle or Qdoba.

The man working at the taco bar was extremely friendly and good customer service never goes unnoticed by me. I had a fish taco plate which, while on a slightly pricier side, used fresh tilapia, justifying the bump in price. It was fresh, well seasoned, and hot from the grill as I could see it being made, and generally all of it was very fresh. Great quality. Go to this place of Chipotle's lack of consistency and quality bums you out.< /review>

<Review>Every time I go they say they are either out of pretzels or that they are frozen or out of cheese. I go almost every week and get the same answer every time. I asked for onions on my super sonic cheese burger because they didn't put any on the last 2 times I got it. They only put 5 chopped onions on it. They are all rude except the man in the green shirt but he still allows the other employees to be rude to customers. The sonic in Bakersfield is WAY better.
UPDATE  went on may 19 and no pretzels or cheese.< /Review>< date>

The only reason they are getting that high of a rating,  is because the young man who I dealt with was very nice. The food was so greasy, the bag was DRENCHED in oil. My chicken slider was made from an old patty, and the bun was burnt.  I was delivering to my friend and his wife at KDH (she was in labor), so I didn't have time to wait to have it remade or replaced. Very disappointing<//text>

Got refunded the twenty bucks we spent on dinner. It was my boyfriends birthday. He ordered a coney hot dog and was disgusted by the way it looked and tried it and it was nasty. I ordered a cheeseburger with no pickles and of course there was pickles. Took them longer to give us a refund than to make our food. Never again. But i like the one on Goshen ave.< /text>

My wife and I were there today to try the new cheese steak coney, for the price the coney was dry to say the least. The staff was rude when we asked what was in the cheese steak when we didn't understand what was happening the staff wasn't too ashamed of being rude when asked any questions about details of food. Thats when another team member had to step in and still rude. Definitely will not be going back! Rated 1 star but -1 would be sufficient. New cheese steak coney not worth the price. Too dry not moist or tasty.< /Text>

<Text>The owner of this location turned off the ability to use the mobile app here a while ago, must have been costing him a couple bucks a day.

The outside of this place is nasty I should have known not to eat here my food was cold and hard. Very disappointed and wasted $25 dollars. Take your money somewhere else. Who ever owns this location needs to be fired. The signs were broken, the drive thur has holes in it and over all gross.<//Text>

So I ordered from Postmates who was doing a sale for Sonic and a little while later our driver called us and said that "Sonic doesn't do Postmates" Well that didn't sound right to us so I called them and the lady on the phone said that the owner of the two Visalia Sonics is refusing Postmates-- not Sonic itself-- just these two stores. My call was ignored for quite a while before the woman picked up to tell me this, being kida rude and short about it.
Although the staff here confirmed our order, and let it sit in limbo for an hour rather than cancelling it --which Postmates phone customer service had to do for us after this store refused their call.<//text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>Late at night long drive through. Very slow to get food or to get cars through line. Waited at order station for very long time. No one would speak. Kept asking. All the cars in line but one gone. So I moved forward. Told them speaker broken and no response. So had to wait longer for order. Several cars behind get food. So they have to wait for me to leave. The burger was horrible. Stale bun. I like the idea of Sonic but service is questionable at each restaurant and the food is 50/50 if it's edible or not.
First x your service and get quality food and it will be good place. Not just for this restaurant but for all.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809528ce3fc035b1:0xc069c827d3ef2963</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Went there a few weeks ago and no one had gloves on and were touching limes they put in drinks.
Went there today and got a Strawberry lime aide and it is  spoiled or the soda lines have mold in them it was absolutely nasty.  Have to dump my drink.
This is terrible.
I have gotten lots of strawberry lime aide's at this Sonic since they opened on Demaree.   I won't go back there for a very long time, if ever.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1590048845913, 'text': "We're sorry to hear you had a negative experience with one of our locations.

< Review>
This location is VERY VERY slow. I ordered two drinks and I sat in the drive through for a good 10 minutes if not longer. I asked for a unsweetened tea with extra lemon. I get home to take a drink and squeeze my lemons because they never do and I have NO lemons. I also had a ocean water which is blue obviously and it was all over the outside of the cup. I find that very rude</Review>

Great shakes, slushes, and fountain drinks. They even have great ice. Prices are half off on drinks from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. everyday and shakes are half off after 8 p.m. all summer long.< /Text>

<Review>I decided to try Sonic again only because it’s 1 mile away from my house and wanted something different. I order two corn dogs and the pretzel twist. Saw no need to check my bag considering those are pretty easy to cook. I get home, open my bag and start with the pretzel which was greasy but expected. I then proceeded to pull out the first corn dog and find it to be burned and not Palatable. The second corn dog wasn’t as bad but unpresentable. How hard is it to cook corn dogs? And if I may add, the service here SUCKS!!!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Great for large drinks and happy hour has half off drinks which is great. Food isn't the best and customer service can use alot of improvement. To get drinks though it is well worth it but I wouldn't expect much friendly service from some of the servers.<//Text>

A chain I can trust to serve consistent food across the country. I know I can find the same yummy shakes for the same low prices at any location.<//review>

Good fast food, kind of slow but I'm hoping that's because everything is fresh. I usually stop at the drive-in to order but I don't get the point when there's a drive thru option.</Review>

The food here is always tasty and hot.
Always friendly service.
Drive thru or Service at your car.
Love all the many many drink flavors and options like regular fountain or slushy.
Milkshakes in big variety of flavors and combinations.

Happy Hour 1/2 price drinks & slushies every day from 2:00-4:00 pm.

Going to miss the 1/2 price shakes after 8:00 pm.

A lot.</review>

<Review>I really used to love this place, but honestly every time i try to park in a stall.. they're closed! And when I've gone through the drive thru, 14 minutes waiting for a cherry limeaid!!!! The last 3 times i attempted to go and was in the drive thru, I ended up leaving before ordering, because yet again, 10 minute wait to make the order, and even longer if I wait!< /Review>< rating>

The food is decent, however they always seem to be out of stuff. I know what I want to order, but can't order it because they are always out of the item I want. This is the last time I will be forced to order something else. I won't be back.<//Review>

They have decent food and drinks at great prices. They messed up our order though and had to wait 15 minutes in line for them to fix it. So make sure you double check your order before leaving. Customer service was ok.</review>

< review>
The staff is mostly young adults who lack urgency and seem like they don;t take their job seriously. I am a huge sonic fan and I know when I order cheese sticks and popcorn chicken that they are making it to order and its going to be a minute so the wait times don't bother me, its the "I-don't-care" attitude and the complete lack or customer service skills that bugs me. All Sonic locations have that terrible drive thru intercom so I understand that some times its hard to communicate with them, but when I can see the order taker through the window and I can see that they are not focused on taking my order because they are laughing  with a co-worker and then asking me to repeat every item I order two or three times, it gets really frustrating. the food is usually up to par so if you want sonic make sure you have time and patients before coming to this one.< /review>

<review>Our experience was a pure waste of 20 mins all we ordered were 2 small shakes and 1 large soda. I tired to get employees attention by 1st by pushing red order button no response then went to window in which I was ignored. I gave them a 1st chance which became the last I will NOT encourage anyone to go here< /review><Gmap_id>0x809528ce3fc035b1:0xc069c827d3ef2963< /Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Customer service is unacceptable.  Food quality and freshness are fair.  Disrespectful, rude, and inattentive service will not only continue to hurt your business, but shows lack of class in the types of employees you hire.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Very good food, it is healthy and the variety of dishes is excellent, there is outdoor seating, as well as the option to eat in the shade in your own car. You can pay the bill without having to leave the car.
I highly recommend it

(Original)
Muy buena comida, es saludable y la variedad de platillos es excelente, hay asientos al aire libre, así como la opción de comer bajo la sombra en tu propio automóvil. Puedes pagar la cuenta sin tener que abandonar el automóvil.
Lo recomiendo ampliamente<//Text>
