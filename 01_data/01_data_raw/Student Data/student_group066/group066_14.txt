<text>Wow so quick and easy. Called to check availability and they had exactly what I was looking for. Arrived at Cube Smart and the whole process was done in less than 20 minutes. And what’s also awesome is that they have an app where i can pay monthly and also have all my account info. Thanks great customer service on phone and at rental location.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<review>3 Break ins , thefts from vehicles, fences being broken into, and the District Manager Andrew Olea will not respond!!!   The ladies/managers who work this storage facility have requested cameras multiple times and Andrew is no where to be found. I have called and left multiple messages offering to pay for the camera system myself. I get no returned calls.
How many vehicles have to be broken into before you put up cameras Andrew??
If you value your goods and don't want your vehicle broken into I advise stay away
11/28/2 update: there have been multiple break in attempts last night, my trailer included, damaging the trailer all over as they tried to pry their way in.
Update 12/1/20.  My RV and another Rv were both attempted to be stolen, they crashed the rvs and didn’t make it out . Now I have a totally damaged RV. Thanks cube smart for having no patrol, security, or security cameras . You guys are the best.
12/3/20 whole RV was stolen from this location. Over 50k gone before i could get enough time off work to put in a different storage facility. $50,000 cubesmart let walk away from this facility. No cameras, no security, manager nowhere to be found when I call in to ask questions.  They did advise me they will not be renting to me anymore since I dont have a trailer to store there. Thanks again cubesmart</review>< pics>

RENTERS BEWARE 70 UNITS BROKEN INTO RECENTLY!!! Mine was one of them. I sent management an email and still have received no response. Bad vibes from older office lady. I feel these recent break ins were an inside job. I don't believe they do things by the book here. And God forbid you happen to be late on ur bill due to a hardship. This spot is money hungry. They demand their payments and are real quick to take ur stuff if you don't pay breaching ur contract. But aren't quick to do sh*t when ur contract saying that they will keep ur belongings safe and on their property ur items are stolen!</review>

I wish I could not give them no stars at all such a bad location my valuable stuff got stolen from this area, Not just that horrible staff that lady Alejandra didn’t have the curiosity to say sorry to what happen to us when we went to close our units out! I truthfully don’t recommend it here at all! Even the police officer recommend me to move my little stuff that was left over out from there it’s not safe area!</Review>

DO NOT RENT HERE!!! Alejandra doesn't do this company any justice. She has been so prejudice towards me from the day I got here. Kicking me out with no type of warnings or anything. Then wants to tell me to be out in ten days when I'm paid up until the 10th of June. And refuses to give me my money or my days ive paid for. Then will only let me in during daytime hours when I'm only Available late afternoon. And I've been here over two years. Never caused any problems what so ever. Its all just racial Profiling at it's very best. Really really sad actual. How this woman keeps her job I will never know.</review>

The people were pleasant and helpful, and the WOW moment was when they explained the 15% discount was for 6 months, but the price increase would be only 2-5% after that. Not 15% plus 2-5%, just 2-5% from initial rate. That is cool!!!!</Review>

<Review>Not only did they raise the monthly storage charges we found rat droppings on all our stuff. When we reported this issue they said another costumer brought the rats in and they are now kicked out, but as far as our stuff they didn't want to do anything about reimbursing us. We had to get clothes cleaned and some of our sports memorabilia got chewed threw. We're taking a loss and they can't even discount the bill. What am I paying for every month? Rodents control should fall directly on them. I thought I was paying for a clean storage space. Not a rat infested box. I'm not happy with the service they're providing.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcb2047fa31f1d:0x4375dd6c7a5d6f12<//Gmap_id>< resp>

My mom and step dads storage as well as a few others had gotten broken into and had stuff stolen. All that was done about this was staff placing a phone call to police when we noticed the brake in. A report was filled but never had any word as to our property or if an arrest ever was made....</Text>

Had my unit broken into, lost thousands of dollars of belongings, many other units had been broken into by the same people, apparently the people had been caught once, police released them and they returned time and time again, obviously no one did anything to prevent them from jumping the fence and taking what they could and walking back out the gate, last I heard they were caught and arrested again, but did not get my belonging back, insurance paid $2000 but still wasn't enough to replace unreplaceable items or the value of them. I'm so sorry I stored here</review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Hello, my name is Javier Juarez, I am dissatisfied with the service provided in this cubesmart, the manager is very unprofessional, I rented a space to put my truck because I don't have space where I live. One of the things when renting a parking space is the comfort of being able to park a vehicle if not how many with enough space at the time that best suits you with a schedule offered by the company and accommodates your needs which due to my case but I did not think that there was a disorder in this cubesmart and little professionalism for part of the manager, the day after paying for my first parking space, they were occupied by another vehicle and the day after, also Saturday and Sunday, Monday, I commented to the manager that in this case, what could Acer do because it was due during out-of-office hours and Who could help me? She answered that the vehicle belonged to another tenant who was looking for it. I was always there. I was really confused with her answer. I told her that I was not going to look for Nobody at nine o'clock at night was not my job and I have been in another rented place and this one in specific and it is nothing personal but there is no good service or professionalism, the company should take attention and correct the bad service of this cubesmart Storage. .

(Original)
Hola mi nombre es Javier juarez estoy en desconforme con el servicio que prestan en este cubesmart la manager es muy poco profecional yo rente un espacio para poner mi troca por que no tengo espacio en donde vivo una de las cosas al rentar un parking space es la comodidad de poder estacionar un vehiculo si no cuantas con espacio suficiente a la hora que mas te convnga con un horario que ofresca la compañia y se acomode atus necesidades el cual due mi caso pero no pense que existia un desorden en este cubesmart y poco profecionalismo por parte de la manager al dia siguiente de pagar mi primer parking space estaban ocupado por otro vehiculo y al dia posterior tambien sabado y domingo el lunes le commente a la manager que en esta casos que podria Acer pues debido que due en horarios fuera de oficina y que quien podria ayudarme Ella contests que el vehiculo era de otro inquilino que lo buscara que siempres estaba ahi yo la verdad confundido con su respuesta le dije que yo no iba a buscar a nadie a Las nueve de la noche no era mi trabajo eh estado en otro lugares rentado y este en especifico y no es nada personal pero no hay bien servicio ni profecionalismo la empresa deberia de tomara atencion y corregir el mal servicio de este cubesmart Storage...< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Clean location where everyone is good at masking up and social distancing.  The cashier is either new or doesn't know how to take custom orders.  Drink turned out ok though and I appreciate the safety precautions here.</text>< Pics>

I went into Starbucks on March 22 and I asked for a strawberry refresher and the lady working there told me that she didn’t know how to make strawberry refreshers but she told me that she knew how to make mango dragon fruit refresher but it won’t come out perfect I thought it would  probably come out a little messy but then she gave me watered down sugar with no color or fruit. I wold give this place a zero if I could. We are never going back.</Text>

Drink was fine, it’s the staff that wasn’t friendly. Maybe I’m just use to the other Starbucks that they are always super friendly, but here at least pretend you want to be there, employee taking my order with her long face looking mad.<//Text>

Didn’t wait too long for my drink, even considering I couldn’t order ahead of time.

More importantly, my drink was made correctly! 😆🙌🏻< /Text>

Came in with a friend and was happily greeted by David the barista. He was so kind and got out drinks outs fast; we really appreciate his attentiveness and suggestions on drinks. Thanks David! :)<//Text>

One female worker is very rude. Unwelcoming facial expressions and doesn’t like to assist with your order if she does it the wrong way. My coffee tasted horrible and she was mad that I handed her coins when she charged me extra for caramel drizzle that she didn’t put in the first place. They need to hire friendly hard working individuals. She also pretended that she didn’t speak Spanish and then once I spoke it to a friend she started specking it. So rude. She also said something bad as a side conversation with her co-worker. Go to another place.</Text>

Went there last night and after helping the guy in front of me the clerk starts to prep the store for the next day for about five minutes.  Then she takes my order, and once again starts preping the store with people standing behind me.  Not to mention, one clerk was already cleaning up, so she could have prep the items.  I understand that you want to get off on time but that's just how it is when you perform certain jobs.  Customers should be the first priority, but someone forgot to give that Starbucks the memo.< /text>

< Review>
Keep in mind that this Starbucks is operated by Target and not Starbucks, so the issues are with Target, not Starbucks. This location is inside the store, so you must walk in. They are always short staffed, so it takes forever to get your order. There has been numerous times when there was only one person there, you place an order, that person makes it, then they help the next customer. If there is more than two or three people in line forget it. The food selection is okay, but they lack many items due to the small size of the location. I go there if I have the extra time and shipping at Target, but there is not my goto location. On the bright side, the staff is amazing, never got an order wrong, and are always friendly. That alone is the only reason I'm willing to go here.</Review>

< Review>
Friday, 5/13/16; stood in line at 3:03 p.m. and there were ten customers ahead.  There seem to be only one barista making and taking drink orders.  Magically, another barista appeared to take orders and run the cash register.  Finally, ordered my green tea Frappuccino at 3:22 p.m.  Received drink at 3:39 p.m.  When I inquired where the manager was, Luz seem annoyed and in others words, like saying "go F yourself."  The things we put up for half price Frappuccinos during not so Happy Hours.< /Review>

We knew in advance there would be a bit of a wait (around 40 min) Seems standard for this location.  No reservations accepted. We were seated in the patio area. The indoor seating was also available. The overall ambiance is relaxed. It was a Sat. morning (11am) and there were families as well as couples and small groups. The drink menu offers specialty drinks from giant mimosa and baby Moscow mules(serve 2-4 people) to specialty lemonades and coffees.  The menu offered something for everyone - Breakfast, lunch and appetizers with a heavy focus on breakfast type dishes. Vegan dishes were available as well as a kids.  The menu was quite diverse Breakfast skillets, crepes, tamale plates, burgers, sandwiches and salads. The average price for a dish is about 17.00 but the portions are good sized. The restroom was clean and well stocked.  The service was fast and friendly without being overbearing.<//Review>

The carnitas were almost uneatable. Other plates were just plane or average. Drinks are good. Service also good. For the money I expected better.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

This place doesn't disappoint!! I had the Sailor's Benedict and Berry Berry mimosa both delicious. I had a salad instead of potatoes which was very pretty with a carrot rose in the middle of it. Their coffee is rich and dark, my favorite. The service was great; people were attentive and our food was hot when it came out of the kitchen. I will gladly drive from Roseville to eat here.<//Review>

My favorite brunch spot, manager Eric is always willing to help out, staff is friendly, food is good and my favorite mimosa is the sangria with a splash of pineapple juice. Bring a friend and share a giant one!<//Review>

Ordered Aloha French Toast and it was very nice to look at, but that was about it. The slices of bread seemed to not be soaked in their special sweet cream at all-- as they state on the menu description. It was very stale and dry, not flavorful at all. This was with all the extra toppings, bananas, pineapple, syrup, white chocolate, whipped cream. The bread should be the focus and it was really bad. Unicorn Mimosa was alright. I was excited to try this place but, was a bit disappointed. May try again eventually.</Text>

Food is great, only problem is they allow customers to camp for additional 2 hours after their meals are complete, there shouldn’t be a 3 hour wait that’s just ridiculous. Especially If you have 20 additional parties outside waiting for seating. Table time needs to be implemented. Just ridiculous.< /Review>

HOT or NOT. Being charged for salsa, well that's a first! I ordered an omelette and asked for hot sauce as a condiment, was given the choice of red, green, or hot salsa. I chose red AND hot. Little did I know that there would be an additional charge for BOTH??? Yeah, I would have gladly taken the tobasco or chulula's for free like the table had next to us.  On a positive note, the Mimosa choices are amazing and the Crossfit omelette was delicious. My husband enjoyed his Diablo Skillet (no hot sauce necessary). We will be back but next time I will be sure to clarify which hot sauce I want in advance.<//text>

Good quality of food and ambiance. And it worth the wait for 42mins after we ordered. We stayed total of 1hr and 16mins.

We only have a problem when we feel like they are in a hurry and interrupting us for 7 times (not exaggerating) our nice breakfast after work. But overall, we might come back because of the food not because of the customer service. Thanks 😉<//Text>

<name>Chloe Martins<//name><date>1535338445229<//date><Rate>3<//Rate><Review>This was a long anticipated trip to this restaurant. I've been wanting to go for awhile. We arrived I guess before the rush, a lot of waiters seemed bored. The restaurant was clean, full of light, and a tad bit freezing. We were served right away. Definitely had good service due to not being busy. We ordered a Mimosa, fresh juice, and two Benedicts. When our food came, I was a tad disappointed with the color of the hollandaise sauce, instead of a light yellow it was a bright yellow. The plate wasn't warm and the food was more on the cold side/lukewarm. I didn't order a salad... so I expect hot fresh food. They did listen about the extra crispy potatoes but had burnt pieces in it. Will I be going be going back, probably not unless a friend wants to go.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Sooo many mimosas to choose from,  and an extensive menu ranging from 5 to 18 dollars. A single pancake at the low end , classic breakfast items about 11 including delicious variations of Eggs Benedict.  Broiled NYsteak topping the list at $18. The entrees we tried were delicious,  service was good considering the crowd.  They have televised sports on every wall which I found detracting from the breakfast experience and most of the reason for the wait.</Text>< Pictures>

I had the corned beef hash, eggs and potatoes.  I like my eggs over-medium and had to send mine back as the whites were runny.  The waitress brought them back in a few minutes and they were perfect!  The service was very good.  The place was half full and pleasantly quiet.  I’d recommend giving it a try.  I plan to go back next time I’m in the area.<//Text><Rating>4</Rating></record>

I came here with my boyfriend and we both ordered the egg benedict. This meal was not the best I have ever had. The English muffin was cold, the ham was very thick and hard to cut through, and the entire dish was hardly warm. They have a huge selection of mimosas, kind of hard to choose from! Each mimosa was delicious. I did return with my mom, and oh my gosh! The crunchy french toast was delicious; Probably the best french toast I've had. My mom ordered the stuffed french toast and absolutely loved it. Great place for brunch. (The earlier you come, the less crowded it is)< /Text>

You know this place has amazing food but not the best wait staff. It was only my second time coming here but got terrible service both times. First time I came in it took the server about 15 minutes to place our drink order. The food was delicious but came out cold, I ate it anyway. The second time was much worse because I got ignored pretty much the whole time by my server who is a manager! Waited for 20 minutes after I completely finished my food to receive my bill. Server/manager was nowhere to be found and I had to ask another employee to bring me my check. Overall, food was good, staff not so much.< /Review>

Amazing place. Delicious food and awesome drinks. Everything is pun-worthy and hilarious. Definitely recommend. If you go after 930-1000, use the wait list platform online before heading over.</Review>

<user_name>Laurel Raleigh-Klimowicz</user_name><response>None</response><review>I love eggs Benedict so I was really excited to try this place. My friend and I came to celebrate my birthday. I ordered the Smokey Ben and my friend ordered the Sope Benedict. Both of us were pleased with portion size and appearance but that's where our pleasure ended. This place is new but I think they bit off more than they can chew.

Food was mediocre and service was terrible. The place needs to rework their recipes and tighten up the line cooks. Servers need to acknowledge customers sooner, check on them more frequently,especially if food is going to take an hour to come out, and make sure they know the menu enough to help customers order. The only thing this place seems to have going is the novelty of giant mimosa glasses meant to be shared.

Overall complaints:
Time for being treated once seated about 16 minutes from when we started watching

Time from ordering to receiving food: 58 minutes
Received wrong side and only came to check on us once and that was before we tried anything and could send back the eggs for being partially raw.

Taste of the food: poor - the sope had no real flavor.  The Smokey Ben salmon was possibly poached and over salted texture and taste was significantly off

Preparation of the food:  poor - eggs under cooked (both orders) bacon considerably over cooked and meat in both dishes was questionable.< /review>< time>

<Review>So many mimosas!! Come hungry their serving size is big and be prepared  to try at 2 different kinds of mimosas while u are there. Food selection is big so definitely need to visit again and try something else! I had the 🦄 Mimosa and the fit omelet!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPAcfzDBxQ4pirhKZxBdpr8lYciCCS6Oma8Dma=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpx0dhi-OiiQiMEIu3kFHPLI7_ujhUN0ATD3J7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809ae35159fa47fb:0x96c1f771188d4454< /gmap_id></record>

Super clean, super terrific service and wait staff, super friendly, super menu selections. Love this place. If you haven't been you need to try. The only reason i don't give it a 5 star review is because the coffee is on the bitter side, especially the decaf and it's $3. Brittany is a super wonderful waitress with wonderful smile and very helpful.</text>

<username>Richard Floyd</username><review>Went 10\4.  Called ahead to request a table outside for 8 because the restaurant is seating over the allotted number of people insde based on covid guidelines.  They said no problem it would be ready in a couple minutes.  Arrived 10 minutes later and were told that they would have an 8 too ready inside for us.  We explained that we were looking for outside because if our older grandma and covid concerns. When they went to seat us they cleared plates off of the table and didn't wipe it until it we requested it.  Overall the food was ok at best and very under seasoned.  My wife's food was sent to the wrong table and had to be remade.  No manager came by to check on us.  Many people walking around with no masks on.  Rolling silverware  at check in infront of people without masks on.  Overall the experience was pretty poor.  The saving grace was our server who did a great job even in a busy restaurant.< /review><GmapID>0x809ae35159fa47fb:0x96c1f771188d4454< /GmapID>< Resp>

Unfortunately the staff were not taking the face mask requirement seriously; about half the employees we could see were wearing their masks below their nose or even their chin :( do not eat here for the next few months if you or any of your household have compromised immune systems/are high risk for contracting covid19.< /Review>< Pics>

If you like Bloody Mary’s repeatedly filled to the top with ice even after you respectfully asked them to remake it 2 times because they were so watered down. And on the 3rd attempt I honestly said oh well and proceeded to drink it anyways. And I wanted to share this with everyone. Mimosas are great though!<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>This was my first visit. The place was busy, but they moved through the wait list quickly. Once seated, the service was quick, friendly and attentive. I ordered the Hangover Benedict. Biscuits, sausage patty, gravy and topped with poached eggs. And a side of hash-browns. The portions were huge. The food quality was very good and everything tasted fresh.

The place is loaded with tables and looks cramped, but it doesn’t feel that way once you’re seated.

We will be coming back for sure<//review><Rate>4< /Rate><username>Robert French</username>< pics>

Very large portions of excellent breakfasts.  Attractive, friendly wait staff.  A la carte items are probably expensive, my bacon was.  Order big and take home half.  Large variety of mimosas.  The largest size supposedly uses an entire bottle of champagne, but IMO they'd be better off selling a pitcher and pouring into flutes.<//Text>

< Review>
This was one of the best omelettes that I've had. I worked as a breakfast chef for four years in a 4 star restaurant which means that I tend to be a bit critical of an omelette and they really did it justice. The egg was cooked perfectly and each ingredient complemented the next. There was just the right amount of cheese and the ratio on each ingredient was spot on. As a chef you understand that an omelette can be a very difficult task to perfect and the chef that made mine has it figured out!
I will definitely be back to try more of the menu!<//Review>

Excellent spot for mimosas and good food.  Love the giant goblet mimosa! Great to share with someone, and the food is excellent!  Gets busy mid morning on the w/e and holidays but if you get there by 8:30, you should be in good shape.< /text>

This is the 1st time we had been to Friends with Benedicts. The place was packed, had to wait almost an hour before our group of 5 was seated. Mimosas weren't cold had to have them remade with cold champagne. Food was very good, maybe not good enough for an hour wait tho. Servers were so busy they barely had time to answer our menu questions. Feeling very rushed to select out food. Took food 30 minutes to get to our table. Will give them 5 stars tho for clean restrooms. I will have to think about  giving them another try because the food was actually pretty good! 1st impressions are everything.<//review>

<username>Craig Beck</username><date>1582645165261< /date><rating>2<//rating><Text>After learning about this place via the news, I was excited to try this place with a close friend who is an Egg's Benedict connoisseur of sorts.  When we finally got a chance to go (there were 4 of us), we were extremely disappointed.  Admittedly, give the number of high reviews, this could have just been a bad day for the chef, but we won't be going back.

Out of the 4 of us, 3 ordered a benedict menu item.  While two of us are traditionalists and enjoy a perfectly runny yoke, one likes theirs cooked to about medium (solid, but with a little ooze).  When we received our orders, all three eggs were hard-hard boiled (completely solid yoke).  We had to send two plates back to get proper poached eggs, while the third just ate it despite being dissatisfied.  When the plates were returned one had decently poached while the other was nearly completely raw (shouldn't have runny whites of the egg).

I had the Border Benedict, which comes with an english muffin, tomato slice, chorizo, avocado, salsa and the poached egg.  Unfortunately, my entire plate was completely saturated in salsa "juice".  The muffins were just soggy former relics and the country potatoes were bathing in water.

Another had the Irish Benedict which had Corned Beef for the meat.  The meat was perfectly on point (I even tried it), however, he had the nearly raw egg and the hollandaise was plain awful.  It was clear they use some sort of powdered hollandaise or perhaps powdered eggs to make it - very disappointing.

While the food was a completely let down, I will say the wait staff was great, the restaurant was clean and inviting, plus the drinks were good.  Had the food been on point, this place would easily get 5 starts.  Sadly, despite purporting itself as specializing in benedicts, our experience was a complete letdown.  Two stars as the wait staff was good and the interior was pleasant, food unfortunately brings down the rating.</Text>< pics>

I loved it, only reason it's a four-star is because I'm not a TV Watcher and found it unnecessary to have a football game on every single wall of the place. One or two behind the bar is okay. There was no where to land your eyes without viewing TV. The food was wonderful we split a spinach egg Benedict, that was great. Bloody Mary's off-the-charts loved them.<//Review>

We had requested first available, in or out,  when we arrived.  After being seated outside we waited 30 min with nobody bring us water or visiting our table. I went back to the hostess and asked if they might send a waitress over,  10 minutes later some body arrives at our table.  The food was great, the country potatoes best around. The mimosas were good but not a good value compared to others eatery's in area.  Bottomless should be available everyday of the week.  Stars given for the food, not the service or value.  - Mark</Review>< Pics>

<review>This was a fun place. We eent when they were pretty brand new for my daughters 21st birthday and we all had a blast. The food was all good. We had everything from salads to burgers to chicken and waffles. The mimosas were definitely the best part. Especially the huge one. We almost needed a step stool to drink it.< /review>< Pics>

If you like drink early and have breakfast with your kids, this is the place, it's loud and the servers are somewhat engaged, the food is good, but it is very expensive, probably the most expensive place for breakfast, except for a hotel or country club. So if you like really expensive food, super loud place, with lots and lots of kids and 100 different ways to drink alcohol before 10am and okay service, then this is your place.<//text>

Unless you're looking to get tanked on cheap bubbles, there's no reason to go here.

There is no ambiance.  You're basically sitting in plain, square cafeteria style room.  It's loud, and on top of that, on our visit they were playing country music way too loud, which forces everyone to talk even louder.

Service was non existent.  We sat at the bar, but the half dozen bartenders were too busy slinging drinks to pay us any mind.

It took over an hour to get our food.  One order was cold, the hollandaise had solidified into a weirdly gelatinous texture.  The other order was okay, but nothing worth returning for.

If you want to be surrounded by loud annoying drunk people, mediocre food and bad service, just go to any dive bar and you'll do better.< /text>

The food and the quality of food is good.  Service was absolutely terrible.  My husband did not get his toast with his meal. I did not get my bagel with my lox and bagel.  Then they never served me my fruit at all. The decaf American coffee is not good...even by their own admission.  When I told them they had forgotten my fruit and that the toast/bagel didn't arrive with the meal, they gave me a $2.62 discount. Weird. I won't be back.</review>

<review>I had a big serving of the Sriracha Benedict (Sriracha on the side) and it was delicious! Will take my family to try the other kinds of Benedicts and mimosas. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Place got busy quick on a Friday morning. Lots of free parking and is wheelchair accessible.<//review>< Pictures>

Went to the Friends with Benedicts Mimosa House for the first time on New Years Eve morning.  Had a great experience with a highly efficient waiter and terrific food.  As some have noted the food doesn't just come out a minute after one has placed an order and there is a reason for that.  Unlike, other places they actually cook the food as it is ordered.  Not ahead of time like way to many places do and it keep it warming.  I prefer to have fresh cooked food and if I have to  wait a little longer so be it. I want fresh..  Maybe I'm old fashioned but to me the restaurant experience was great from A to Z.<//Text>

We had the host seat us outside and then had to wait almost 10 minutes before I went inside to ask if someone was coming to serve us. Then we waited another 5 minutes for someone to come. Finally we got some drinks and the the food came out fairly quick. Had to go grab myself salt, pepper and condiments since no one brought them. Our server never checked on us so I had to go inside again to ask for some extra sauce. My eggs on my Benedict were poached hard and not runny at all. It was also missing my avocado. Our drinks never got filled either. I wasn't able to get any of it fixed since our server, Alexa L, never checked on us until we were almost done. She wasn't very friendly either. I would like to come back and give it a second shot but definitly would not want the same server.< /Review>< gmap_id>

I had the worst experience here on Sunday (Mothers Day). I have been dying to eat here, so my husband took my mom and I here on Mothers Day.  I tried so hard to give them the benefit of the doubt because it was busy.  So this review will not talk about the wait time or how crowded it was or anything like that. I can forgive that, however I can not forgive the rest of the experience.
Once we finally got our food the waitress was in such a hurry to pass out the plates, that she neglected to tell my husband that his skillet was hot! So he grabbed it and burned his thumb. He immediately put his thumb into his ice water for relief.  The waitress said nothing! So I went up to the hostess, because all of the wait staff were busy.  I went to her to ask if we could get some ice in a bag or something of that effect for his finger.  Right next to the hostess was a man and he just ignored the whole convo, but heard it and acknowledged that I was there. Within minutes his finger was blistered and still burning. Our waiter brought out the ice with a packet of ointment for a burn and asked my husband to please put it on his thumb. Time went by and no one came out to talk to us or even ask if he was okay.  I was shocked! I would have thought that at least the manager would have come and said something! ANYTHING!!! So I asked the waiter when we were leaving if the man at the front with the hostess was the manager and he said no, he was the owner!!! I was shocked..
Secondly I ordered one of the benedicts the food was cold and the English muffin was so hard that I could barley cut it with a knife, let alone my teeth.
Needless to say, I am sad. I wanted to like this place and like I said I let a lot of stuff go that day, that I am not even writing about because they were so busy with Mothers day, but this I can't see past! I am so disappointed!< /Text>

Our favorite spot for brunch dates. The benedicts are scrumptious smothered in decadent hollandaise sauce and a large variety of other toppings. The service is generally quick and friendly. I have not tried any mimosas yet but the orange juice is super fresh and not too sweet. They don't take reservations but you can call ahead to put your name in line.<//Text>

Great local place!  Food was fresh, nice presentation and delicious.  Only tiny comment is that we were charged $1.50 for a little more sour cream for the burrito.  Not so at most restaurants...<//review>

Everything was so delicious,  omlets, mimosas. Service was wonderful too. My only issue was that I'm not a coffee drinker. I ordered an ice tea.  The worst ice tea I've ever had.  I don't know if it was a horrible mix or it was brewed and was brewed badly, or left in the container for days but it was not fit to drink. Otherwise everything was great.<//Text>

With such a large menu it’s really disappointing there is not a single vegan option! Even Purple Place has several now. You’re missing out on a huge opportunity with the thousands of locals that are vegan!</Review>

No seasoning on my veggie omelette and it had way too much cheese inside versus veggies, and the Hollandaise sauce on our Eggs Benedict was bland. The omelette was hot but the Benedict was cold. I ordered a mango mimosa and it was fairly tasteless as well. The server was very kind but it took forever to be served. I thought they were understaffed, but when my husband went inside to use the facilities, he said they were standing around talking. Meanwhile, a family out on the patio where we were got up and left because no one came to take their order, and the staff never even noticed. We're not going back, and that's too bad because we live nearby.< /Review><Name>Bernadette Cranmer</Name></record></dataset><record>

Quality and taste of food was mediocre at best.  Chicken and waffles was pretty awful, tasted like frozen Tyson chicken strips.
Mimosas were great though!
Also issues with bill, dont think I will come back< /Review>

Trace was the best server I have had in a long while. 5 stars for service. 3 stars for Bloddy Mary & Brunch faire. Noting special to be said on the food and drink front. Full coffee bar was a added benifit.< /text>

Food was ok.   I ordered the Folsom Dam and the ham was paper thin. Service was slow and I was almost half done with my meal before my nephew actually got his meal. Also my son-in-law ordered a meat omelette and when he was all done with his meal then they brought his toast.</text>

Really good food. We waited a while but it was worth it. I can't remember our waiters name but he checked on us often but not too often (you know what I'm talking about).

I'm picky about never having my water go empty and he passed the test. Will come back here soon.< /Review>

The food was wonderful, sadly the service was not.  15 minutes after being seated with no one having come by to check on us or take our order, my husband was ready to leave. I was hungry and I really wanted to try the place so I recommended we wait another 3-5 minutes. About 5 minutes later our waiter finally came by, this was a Thursday morning and the place was not busy. No apology for the delay.

I ordered the sailor benedict, but asked first how long it would take as I was hungry, and a waterfall mimosa. The mimosa was ok, the benedict, with crab, salmon and shrimp was delicious. My husband had the linguica scramble (?) which he said was very good. I might be willing to give it another try although with so many good breakfast choices around probably not. I definitely would not go on a weekend, if service is bad when it’s slow it must be terrible on the weekends when I’ve heard the place is crazy busy.</review>

I haven't received my food yet and it doesn't matter how good it is, it won't change my review. We were quoted 20 minutes and it took 45 minutes to get sat. The food took well over 45 minutes to arrive. Not coming back and no I'm not sorry.</text>

I'm writing this on May 15th, 2021, and the current COVID-safe setup they have with reserving a lane for family swim or lap swim or reserving a time slot in a class works very well and feels very safe! Each time slot gives you 45 minutes of time in the pool, with 15 minutes in between so it never feels crowded and there's time for them to clean surfaces between groups. The pool and facility are very clean and while the water is a tad chilly if you're just standing still, it's actually plenty warm once you get swimming.<//review>

I love swimming at this pool. Great programs for beginner lessons, swim teams for adults and kids as well as open swim on the weekends. The pool is clean and clear. They keep the water pretty warm all year round. Staff is helpful and skillful.< /Text>

Great outdoor pool! Well kept and friendly staff. I go to this pool for lap swimming about twice a week and is so much better than gym pools. The best times is when lap swimming is opened up to 50m! They use a sodium based chlorine that cuts down on the over chlorinated feeling. At the time of writing, open during Covid, and kept safe and managed well.</review>

< Review>
I typically swim at a city swim complex near USC, but it remains closed due to COVID-19. I have wanted to try the Culver City Plunge for years, but it always seemed too busy for my liking. I am a decent swimmer, but definitely not a *confident* one so I prefer having a lane to myself. Now that the plunge has reopened and they only allow one person per lane I figured it was a great time to try it out. Firstly I am quite impressed with the measures they are taking to ensure the safety of patrons. It's well-organized and well-executed. I docked one star because there has been more than on occasion in which one of the staff members checking us in has had his mask over his mouth, but not his nose. It defeats the purpose of wearing a mask if you have your nose exposed. A few patrons in line are sometimes guilty of this as well which is somewhat vexing. All that said, the pool is lovely and the staff is as well. Overall, a great place to come for a swim.< /Review>

Awesome place to have a private party!!!
Earnesha is the lady that handles all party planning she was very thorough in handling all the plans and she made it very easy. The day of the party the life guards were very tentative to the kids party. The facility was very clean and intact.  Thank you the kids had a wonderful time!!!< /Text>

Clean place, friendly staff, plenty of lifeguards on duty. Was there today for the first time, babysitting 4 boys ages 5-13 (a Saturday) in the middle of the afternoon, and the place was empty.  No concern of who was where at any point.  Nice separation btwn the regular (young ones) area, diving area, and lap areas.  Plenty of shade and seating/lounging.  Will be back for sure!<//Text>

<Text>The pool may not be "state of the art", but the restrooms and showers are reasonably clean and the weekday 11-2 long course lap swim session is the best stress reliever!  Not crowded. Low entry fee even for a non-resident.<//Text>< pictures>

I’ve recently started attending swim workouts at the Culver City Municipal Plunge with an adult club swim team.  From my first time in this pool, I was hooked!  The Culver City coaches give great workouts, and the pool is the perfect temperature for swimming laps.  This pool also offers Swim 101 workouts for beginners.  Beautiful facility, and it’s easy to find parking in the area.  You can swim here morning, noon, and night. I would recommend to everybody!<//review>

Culver City plunge is ONLY open to children to swim in the summer time. The CCUSD school don’t have a pool. There is no public place to swim for Culver City children. I can’t say I am not disappointed. Isn’t the plunge supposed to serve the community?<//Text>

over priced, i remember growing up there as a kid it cost 1$ to get in and swim mon-sat from 12pm to 5pm. we used to have a blast! i dont know why cc changed so much and when the yuppie douchery took over but its sad, after that all of us would either head to the teen center then go have a slice of pizza at backstop. what a change from 16 years ago.< /text>

Whomever hired the unprofessional girl behind the counter probably should slap themselves...That girl needs to GO, i mean she was so rude when I went to swap a battery out covered thru warranty. She refused to believe i don't have to pay, and by the time she caught onto the transaction, wisdom led me out the door and to ANY other place that didn't provoke me to such rage! STAY  AWAY<//Text>

<review>I called AAA and they contracted the job out to S&J Services. I am very happy that they did. Rafael came out quickly to handle our situation. He was very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. He diagnosed our battery, replaced it, and answered all the questions and concerns I had. These are the moments that make you appreciate your AAA membership.< /review><userid>106045166530295454572<//userid><gmap_id>0x80c32dd9dd92c30d:0xe81590e0a6900481< /gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures>< Name>

We had our first office visit our our little dog Rasty.  First impression?  The place was spotless and utterly immaculate...we were greeted by two gracious and efficient persons at the counter (I regret the I failed to get their names).

We were escorted to an examination room, also spotless, and greeted by a very kind and pleasant vet tech, Jovani (sp) who efficiently filled out paperwork and prepared our pet for the examination to follow.

Within minutes, Dr. Chen appeared and gave Rasty a thorough checkup and her required vaccine booster shot.  He also was the epitome of caring professionalism, and our crazy little dog responded to him with affection...a true test, eh?

We are delighted with the care, the cleanliness, and the compassion of the entire team...our gratitude is boundless...We feel very fortunate to have found them.</review>

The folks at El Camino Vet Hospital are awesome! Our pets are always greeted by name when we arrive, the staff is very professional, caring, and considerate. The doctors consider all options when suggesting treatments and make me feel like I'm making an informed decision. I highly recommend El Camino Vet Hospital.< /review>

The staff here is fantastic. They take care the 3 pups I have and that's not easy. They are kind, loving, knowledgeable and easy on the wallet. I would recommend them to anyone who asks.<//Text>

They offered animal heath insurance which helped with our cost towards Brandy's treatment.  I felt cared for as they cared for Brandy.  She is on the mend now and walking around the house looking for someone to play with her. :) Much Thanks to the staff! RLM< /review>< Rating>

I found a cat (not my cat) in very bad shape in my backyard today and I took it here. They took the cat immediately and had me fill out a paper and that was it. Very great pet emergency hospital<//review>

The staff are always nice and the vet techs are always very caring.  I have taken my fur babies here since 2011. They loving cared for my sick fur baby that unfortunately had an untreatable illness and passed away. They not only took care of him but also us.
On our recent visit our little girl was having problems and did not want the Tech to come near. She had a low soft growl, the Tech got on the floor and patiently waited for her to come to him.  She then was at ease.  They helped us to ease her pain, now she is running around like she was a puppy again!

Everyone who works here from the front desk to the techs and doctor are super awesome, sweet, and truly compassionate people. I always sadly have a budget to crunch when I go in there and with my cat getting up in years I've gotten fairly familiar with all the folks at this clinic. They are always willing to work with what I have in whatever way is possible, while helping my critters feel better. I absolutely love and appreciate every single person that works here and always leave feeling incredibly grateful. Thank you all for all that you do. These people make a huge difference in our lives and I'm so grateful.< /text>

Love this vet hospital.  They are open 7 days a week which is great as our 17 year old fur babies don't always follow regular work day rules!  Staff and doctors are great.  Explanations are always thorough and they are very patient in helping us understand.   Gloria and Mike<//Text>

<Text>I could not have a better group take care of my pets. I have been bringing my cats here for decades now (3 generations). I have nothing negative to say. The entire staff is knowledgeable, professional, compassionate, warm and friendly. They have helped me keep my cats healthy and happy. I have recommended them to others who are also completely happy with their service, and I will continue to recommend them to any pet owners.</Text>< userid>

<username>Diane Slusher</username><Date>1482508015444<//Date><Review>Loved finding a vet with evening hours and was amazed to get a same day appointment. From the person who I spoke with on the phone...to being checked in...to the vet assistant who took our dog's vital signs...to the doctor....everyone was very professional and very caring.  They immediately were able to diagnose what was wrong with our pet, prescribed the proper medicine and put her on the road to health quickly.  Our dog is once again happy and healthy.  Thank you, El Camino Vet!</Review></record>

Last week, our Black Lab of almost 13 years old was in really bad shape. I tried to call her regular veterinarian, but he wouldn't be in in that afternoon. I searched the web and read some reviews and called El Camino Veterinary Hospital, made the appointment for 2 hours later. The front desk person was really nice and explained all the options and prices for us. The veterinarian made a examination and explain all our questions in a very sincere way. Since we didn't want our dog to suffer anymore, we made the option for euthanasia. : (  He also told us that we could say our goodbyes to our sweet Lucy and after the process was done we could stay a little longer in the room with her. The place is clean, the staff is really nice and very accommodating and yesterday we receive a "Thinking of You" card from the staff of El Camino Vet. Hospital. I thought that it was a good reason besides the well care that was given to Lucy to write a review. Thank you very much for your kindness.</Review>

<Text>This hospital has a very welcoming staff, they are always polite and helpful. I can always call them and ask a question whenever I have any concerns without actually coming in.
Dr. Morgan is very experienced and he has on many occasions saved me money because I happen to be an overreacting person. He recommends the necessary treatment without pushing the extra expenses by telling me about the options I can do myself at home.
I also happened to get Dr. Perry once, who listened to my rambling with no complaints, was very caring and professional. Dr. Perry also had helpful suggestion for dental care, which is never an issue until it's too late, so the advice was definitely a big plus.
The vet techs are supportive, enjoy the company of your pet and love what they do, they always handle my cats with love and care. People tend to overlook the techs but trust me they do a lot of work and spend the most time with your pets!
My cats have been here for over a year and so far so good! I've asked a ton of questions every time I came in about shots, type/brand of food, litter, deworming, spaying etc. I've also visited them when they used to do emergency visits, back in the day.
I'm not going to lie, there are cheaper vet offices out there, but really not by that much. They also offer a free follow up appointment, which is definitely worth mentioning. You can schedule an appointment for free up to 10 days or so later as long as it is for the same issue, to re-examine and check the progress.< /Text><Time>1446254870949</Time></record></dataset><record>

Went here in Jan 2020 to get my dog's annual shots of taken care of. She is very friendly with people and she shrank into me and my spouse as soon as the Dr. came in dressed in extra protective arm and hand gear and stated she had experience with aggressive dogs and was clearly acting nervous despite her copious explanations of experience. We were both taken aback at this comment and asked why she assumed our Staffordshire Terrier was aggressive.  She could not give us an answer. Our dog became more and more nervous as she explained they'd need to concoct a substitute for one of the shots since it was not in stock and it would be administered to the mouth via a needleless shot. We explained our dog became frightened when foreign objects were brought near her face. We tried to help administer the drug (laying on the floor at one point) with no success until finally one of the assistants suggested putting it with food which worked well. This of course was after our dog was traumatized (and only worked after the Dr. left the room). We will not be returning.</text>

We have been seeing Dr. Morgan at El Camino Vet Hospital for almost 20 years now.  I love the way the staff treats my animals and me too!  We have moved about 20 miles away from El Camino Vet but never complain about the drive because we know our pet will be cared for.  I highly recommend El Camino for the health of your animal and your peace of mind<//text>

We have been taking our Scottie, Lucy, to El Camino Veterinary for about 10 years. The staff at El Camino is always very courteous and helpful with our needs. Dr. Morgan and all the other resident DVM’s are very professional and always provide the best care and options when discussing our Pet’s needs. I highly recommend El Camino to anyone looking for a new Veterinary.</Review>

Today our beloved Boris woke up sick, much sicker than we imagined before Dr Smarty and the staff did some diagnostics. It turned out he had severe abdominal bleeding and probable liver cancer. We decided to do the merciful thing. The staff couldn't have been more sensitive to us and our pet. Thanks< /Review>

This is the first time I have ever taken a pet of mine to a Vet. I didn't know what to expect but I'm so glad I found this place. I was a bit late to my appointment but they seen my pet almost as soon as we got there. The staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and inviting. My dog had an allergic reaction from what we think could've been a bee sting or spider bite of some sort, and her face was swollen. The exam and a shot she needed (which helped her get better!!) totaled to $71 something. The prices were lower than what I expected and I am so impressed with the fact that I can bring my dog back a few days after she's been seen to make sure shes okay, free of charge! Plus, Zoey got a treat on our way out. I will recommend this clinic to anyone and everyone and will be returning if and whenever needed. Thank you for the great first time experience!<//Text>

Great care from the doctor and technician and follow-up questions I made post-visit -- the doctors spent a lot of time making sure my questions were answered.</review>

<Text>After finding EC Vet Hospital during a scary weekend emergency last Spring, I decided to make my dog's regular wellness checkup and vaccine appointment with them this month. Once again my interactions with Drs  Smartt and Morgan were pleasant, professional and informative. Their manner of handling my large but often nervous dog was very compassionate and patient. Prices are quite reasonable for the high degree of care and the range of available appointment hours surpasses most private practices I've found. We have definitely found a new vet and I could not be happier with or not confident in my choice.< /Text><gmap_id>0x809adbef2dff0b55:0x81db853865f5c783< /gmap_id><name>Pamela Quinn</name>< UserId.>

My visit was competely unexpected. I had accompanied a friend with her sick pup. He had eaten rat poison. I know this is second hand info but if I owned a pet i can assure you this is where i would bring it for any of my pets needs. They were friendly fast and informative. My friend came a hott mess and left happy and quite confident she would return the next day for her precious Howie just as he was before. And as you would know it she did! Thanks to all those great vets.</text>

El Camino Verinary Hospital has cared for my dog since we found her in 2008.  They really care about her and they show it in her care.  When we found her she was in heat, covered in fleas, matted and extremely traumatized. They were very gentle and understanding of her fears.< /Text>

Exvellant. Very professional. And they care about your pet. Wouldn't go anywhere but ECV. Love my dogs Vet DR Chen. He's a good Doc and of course my GIRL LIZ!. ALL of the staff is wonderful but I always have a had a great relationship with Liz. 5 star I'd be more likely to say 10 star.
Love you guys.

When I got there with my injured dog they told me it was $120 for an exam, just an exam with no x-rays or anything involved. So they kept making everything more expensive after they found out we only had 120 on us. Are they stupid or something, if we say we only have 120 on us then you don't raise the price to 450+ & then 2,100. They were nice to us when we first went in there but when they found out we only so much money on us they were treating us very rudely. They don't care about you or your pets, they just care about money and are a money hungry business. Later I found a vet clinic that only cost $25 dollars for an exam, the same exact exam I paid $120 for. SHAME ON THEM!! NEVER AGAIN WILL I COME BACK TO THIS TERRIBLE VETERINARY CLINIC!!!!!<//Review>< pics>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>They are trying to say I 'owe them money' for examinations that never happened. I brought my cats in and they brought them directly to the back (It was suppose to be an emergency visit.) I was referred to go there because I had just gotten fired and was waiting for my EDD to come through, I told them this, because I believe honesty is best. They put my application through to see if I qualified for the payment plan (Care Credit, I believe?) and kept telling me there was nothing they could do until It could be verified. They told me how scared my cats were adn that they were looking for me. When I was denied care credit, they told me there was nothing they could do but send me home with my cats and that the night would be the deciding factor if they would make it. I asked the vet if there was anything at home I could do, he suggested a few things. and that was it. So when did they examinations happen? Was it when my cats were in the back and they were telling me there wasn't anything they could do until approved for Care Credit? Do NOT go here. Not worth it, and they charge you for absolutely nothing. I will be fighting this charge because there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DONE for my cats. No exam, nothing. I didn't even know what was wrong until the next day when a nice vet (with a coupon for free exams, thank god) saw them.

I took my puppy there on 11/12/15 and they charged me 100 for the emergency visit and then they charged me another 73 to take the parvo test on him and they said it was negative at that point my baby was already extremely weak and then the girl in the front desk came to say they would refund me some money and only charge me for a normal app after that they took about half an hour if not more to figure out what they can do to help him when they came back they charge was so high that I knew it wasn't so I decided to leave and take him else where he was only getting wors.. I took him to a vet place a few blocks down and they said just by the symptoms and the way the puppy looked they knew it was parvo and that it was too late to try and safe him but they would do the best the plans they gave me were half of what they said here and it was a more extensive plan but unfortunately before I signed my puppy had already passed away....!!!!!!! NEVER TAKE YOUR PETS HERE ALL THEY DO IS TAKE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!</Review>

< Review>
The emergency vet Dr. Chen failed to notice a mass in my 2 year old cat's abdomen when I brought him in due to lack of appetite, and prescribed my cat suffering from a liver failure antibiotics for a mouth infection (which I suspected was the cause but I took him to a veterinarian because I am not one.) He essentially prescribed my cat poison that killed him. Granted he was 2 and not obese, so lipidosis was a fluke. I did express concern over his lethargy and failure to eat as well as vomiting and called when he continued to vomit, they said his appetite should come back after the antibiotics and I trusted them. Having a feeling that El Camino may not be a very good vet, I took him to Midtown animal hospital a few days later (as soon as I could get an appointment) when the antibiotics were making him vomit worse. Midtown noticed a massive liver immediately and then confirmed this on an X-ray then referred me to VCA referral emergency hospital in Rancho Cordova, because they don't do intensive care there, and told me about CARE credit because their services are very expensive (but worth it.) So I am struggling to get my cat seen by the real emergency veterinary service now to find out if it is in any way treatable. My cat is now yellow with jaundice and in hospital. Meanwhile, it is force feeding to keep him from going downhill too painfully and pain meds and many costly diagnostics. Don't waste your money here on subpar veterinary services - go somewhere that the vets are not negligent and just trying to sell you something that may or may not help then get you out the door instead of this horrible place. Dr. Chen is negligent and does not care about your pet.

Update: My beloved cat died, $5000 in debt later of what would have been a very treatable disease if caught earlier by a competent vet. I wasted $150 on incompetent diagnosis and would consider suing them in small claims court if I were not moving out of state next week. They did not offer to reimburse me for their misdiagnosis and negligence. They are the one vet that did not send a sympathy card of the 3 we went to in this ordeal too. Not that any amount of money can ever replace my Vlad cat. I cry myself to sleep at night and kick myself every day for going there because it had good reviews, was close and was the only emergency vet I knew about at the time. We lost precious days that might have made a difference by being steered wrong here and believing that he "would be fine after antibiotics." and that the throwing up was "no big deal" and would soon stop. That would probably work most of the time, but if you are a veterinarian, you should rule out anything catastrophic with a simple blood test and not prescribe an antibiotic with a side effect of nausea without anti-emetics and appetite stimulants to a cat that won't eat, from what other vets I took my cat to subsequently when trying to save him have said. Of course I wanted to believe that he didn't need any of that. That cat meant a lot to me, and laid by my side every day when I was recovering from a miscarriage and found out I can never have children. Don't lose your beloved pet by trusting incompetent vets who do not know what to feel for in the abdomen and tell you 'blood tests aren't necessary' when your pet is sick. Of course you want to believe that your pet is okay and to trust a vet, but I'd rather pay for real diagnostics than go somewhere that will guess and lie, pretending to know what they are doing. Go to a real emergency vet! (VCA or Davis.) I will definitely be filing a complaint.</Review>

Absolutely incredible. My husband and I get a massage every week and figured we would try a new spot. So happy we did! They are very meticulous!! We also had a wonderful experience with the host matt. He was so welcoming and full of kindness. He made the experience even better. Can't wait to go back.</review>

<review>I suggest taking a uber or lyft to location since there is only three parking spots on site. Street parking free on sunday. Highly recommend the sports deep tissue massage. They do not off the milk looking bath any more but there is a 20 min hot tub bath offer that preps your body perfectly before getting a massage. There are multiple bathrooms on campus. Small but cute quaint spa. Its better to shower at home as the shower stalls here are quite small. Very clean place. I have sensitive skin so if i broke out i would tell you not to go but its very clean while i was showering this cleaning woman came in multiple times to clean up after previous guests. Friendly staff.< /review>< userid>

It was a great experience! I went with my mom while she was visiting me, and she is quite the massage connoisseur. We both felt so relaxed and enjoyed every minute. The only reason I do not give another star was because people that worked there would walk by our room talking a little loud, as well as being able to hear honking from outside. Other than that, the stones, the reflexology, the sauna were probably THE BEST WE HAVE EVER HAD!<//text>

Went here with my boyfriend on a friday night. I really appreciated the atmosphere and the staffs are very comforting. They went all out on the service and they really cared for us. I would definitely come back if we ever had another spare time at Larchmont Sanctuary.<//text>

I've been coming here for maybe 10 years - actually ever since they had their original location.  I've gotten four out of five of my family members to frequent here as well.  We usually don't have a favorite masseuse, as we always say whoever you get is great. I've also made regular customers out of friends and clients alike, and they also thank me for recommending them to this hidden gem.<//review>

This was my first time here and personally I thought it was great! However because it was my first time I wished I got to use their sauna. Which is why I only gave them 4 stars because I'm not sure how much of a better experience it would be.< /review>

<rating>4</rating><Date>1605641828444<//Date><Review>Still a huge fan of Larchmont Sanctuary Spa even if it's a little spendy. So clean and well run, it's quite blissful...Boo treated me and Mumsy to a massage for Xmas, which is the perfect gift for both of us.
I had a Swedish massage with Maria Lapid - I have to say that this was the *best* massage I've had in a while. She was just the right pressure - combo of deep pressure on the shoulder knots and cautious around my super ticklish glutes - she's very intuitive (and threw in some energy work too). I'm going to get a longer session with her next time I go!</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b8c794686ed9:0xb89dfd1f97140d88<//gmap_id><user_id>105914228017957648492< /user_id></record>

<review>Have heard wonderful things about this spa. I had a one time awkward experience the only one time I stopped by to purchase a giftcard, but I am definitely in to give them a try again. I believe it's worth it, and I am thrilled, since my friends say nothing but praise about this Spa.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Loved my facial. Platza was awesome .. I got my bikini waxed and did a massage with Jose. Wow!!!! I feel better than ever :) Love going to the cafe for snacks. I love the body scrubs too!  My banya pass was free because I got a facial - loved the products... Bought a home routine :) I didn't make it to the roof with the pretty view.. Next time :)<//Text>

This spa is incredible!
By far the best Spa experience I have had in Los Angeles. Larchmont Sanctuary Spa has raised the bar.
Tabitha was amazing.
You won't want to try any other spa in Houston after Larchmont Sanctuary Spa!<//review>

I visited Larchmont Sanctuary the other day for the first time and must say, I can't wait to go back! From the moment I walked in the door I was greeted with warm smiles.<//Review>

<Text>From the waiting area to the service– everything at Larchmont was warm and cozy. The waiting room was inviting and the front desk staff was attentive.
All in all, the spa session at Larchmont was a much needed retreat for us and the whole experience was simply rejuvenating. We also enjoyed snacks and the company of friendly and amazing therapists. The facials and massages by expert masseuses took all our stress and fatigue away and left us physically as well as mentally renewed.
The experience at Larchmont left us mesmerised and wanting for more and so, we'll definitely be going back!< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b8c794686ed9:0xb89dfd1f97140d88<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They gave us a candle as a gift, and gave me a dozen red roses for my birthday as an add on to our package! Could not be more impressed and ready to return soon.

Massage by man( can't remember name) was just ok. Kept rubbing in one spot making my whole body jump around on the already wobbly table. Loved the copper tub though. Wish I could just go for that and skip the guy masseuse.<//review>

I spent a glorious afternoon at Larchmont Sanctuary and loved the intimate relaxing environment. Mimosas were served in a cozy room by the fireplace while waiting for my facial. I am loving my husband for giving me this spa day!  I felt so special and taken care of by everyone at this wonderful spa. I had the Illuminating Detox treatment, stone massage and an Anti-aging facial. I left feeling so relaxed, energized and glowing! The therapists were skilled and had wonderful healing hands.< /Text>

My wife and I were given a spa day at the Larchmont Sanctuary spa as a wedding gift and we went to enjoy a well-pampered day at the spa.

It's a warm and intimate location that has all the trappings of a great spa that I enjoy. Cozy waiting room with a fireplace, attentive front-desk staff, snacks/water and amazing therapists. We thought it was perfect for us.

My wife and I enjoyed a massage from Victor and Vivian, which my wife said her's was "life changing". I had Victor for mine and he did some moves I had never even experienced before. He did this thing with my neck/skull area that made my body go limp. I even tried to have my wife do it at home the next day.

My favorite part was the facial with Liz. As a guy, I have very little experience with facials and she immediately made me feel comfortable and was able to get me to open up and explain what I wanted out of the treatment. I told Liz I wanted to relax and "make my skin look fresh". We decided on the Vitamin C facial for me and I laid down and she went to do her thing. The whole process was enjoyable and she even did this amazing arm massage that was perfect. I left completely relaxed and my wife said my face was glowing.

I live in the general area and I'll be coming back whenever I need to unwind.</text>

The place is clean,  the staff is nice, the Caffè food was good.  Overall however,  it was way too over priced.  The place becomes pretty crowded in the afternoon.  The ambiance is more reminiscent of a loud, chaotic  gym than a peaceful spa at that point.< /review>

<text>My husband gifted me a Pregnancy Retreat Package here. I am a little over 34 weeks pregnant and work on my feet full time, so my body was definitely in need of some TLC. My spa day here was a dreammmmm.

The foot soak at the beginning was underwhelming, but everything after that was pure MAGIC! Heather did my prenatal massage and she was so attentive, kind and dedicated to my comfort. Her energy is awesome and she relieved so much tension in my hips, legs and feet! Yumie did my facial and she was also a joy to work with. She was so warm and kind, and provided a lot of insight about my skin. My face was glowing when I left! Also, the hot stone massage on my neck and shoulders was incredible!

Thank you so much for the wonderful day! It was such a treat!<//text>< pics>

I would have loved to experience what everyone else is saying but instead I haven't even been able to get to the spa. I made my appointment on Jan 12 for January 24th. During the phone call, they took my credit card information, but never told me about their policy of taking payment for services at time of booking which didn't even happened. The payment was trying to process today. I've been to many spas, even a 4 diamond resort, and have never had to pay during booking. I wouldn't recommend thieving practices such as those.<//Text>

I would recommend this place to anyone. I always make sure to stop by whenever I am in the LA area. The spa is so relaxing and they use my favorite skin care line Environ. You must try an environ facial and a massage with Victor!!</review>

<Text>EXPECT TO WAIT OVER AN HOUR!!!!!!!!

I have an appointment at 3:00 and it's already 4:15 I happen to come early to the appointment and they received me before 3:00.
Yet I am still waiting here for the doc. Crazy thing is that I am the only person here! I have never in my life had to wait oh so long for them just to have a check up done it's RIDICULOUS.

Don't wast your time on seeing the doctor here. They honestly need to work on reaciving people faster.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-8EwQQ-K6uGjhZCJgpOZBR9xTyua6Iltw4Ger=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

My aunt was coming to this place and sometimes she forgets to bring her money. However, one day there was a noncompassionate front desk worker. My aunt only had 20 bucks on her that day. She asked if she could pay the rest when she came back. The front desk worker would not have it. She was rude to her and told her that if she didn't pay the 25 dollars that she was going to put her down as that she missed her appointment so that they would charge my aunt the late appointment fee. My aunt proceeded to tell the woman that the male had let her pay like that before. Then the front desk worker began to ignore my aunt, she was typing on her computer and writing things down. My aunt thought this was absolutely childish behavior. Very non professional to help work out solutions with loyal costumers. Like i get it's low income but it is not an excuse to treat the customers like trash. Anyway my aunt got tired of being ignored so she pretty much said fine do whatever you want and walked out. When my aunt tried to schedule another appointment they had written a note in her file that she refused to pay. After that they did not allow my aunt to make any more appointments. We need compassionate healthcare workers at this site. Like isn't that why they went into the field? To help their community? Hopefully they change behavior around and hire professional personnel. TL;DR: front desk worker was rude to my aunt.</Text>

The people are not welcoming at all no experience I have tried getting my prescription filled for over a month now and they keep giving me the wrong information on the prescription.

I’m now out of my medicine and have no idea when it’ll be filled because of these people. I have never in my life experienced such uneducated “doctors” before.

Who ever is at the front desk should be fired. I've been forced to come here and appear to have ZERO options about it if I want mental help.

My 'psychologist' just quit on me because I asked him to be professional. Anyone gonna follow up? Hell no.<//Review>

Covid vaccines are ONLY to be administered to individuals that are in their respective phases. Some of the staff in this clinic administered them to their own family members, therefore limiting the already limited amount of vaccines to the individuals in phase 1. Personally, I would not want my health in the hands of a healthcare worker who prioritizes their own selfishness over the health of their community as a whole. Having an average rating of less than 2 stars is not surprising.<//Review>

Every one at the Foundation is professional and courteous.  Sometimes there is a wait because multiple services are being provided to the patients.  It saves the patient several trips so to combine Medical, dental and EyeCare on the same day is actually of benefit to the patients.
The place is cleaner than any other Clinic you will visit - private or Community Clinics. This is strictly enforced throughout the departments
Case Management and Nutritional education is excellent, which has helped the physicians and specialists to better control chronic conditions like Diabetes and Hypertension.
Patients are given an option of evening and weekend appointments and many come from as far away as Green Field  and King City, Los Banos and Turlock.
Don’t take my word for it- make an appointment and experience for yourself the services provided at the Health Foundation.
All are welcome!<//text>

I went to this place a year ago to become a new patient and I haven't heard from them...my health provider sent what they needed and I'm still waiting for the call... they are unprofessional, they don't know how to welcome new patients... at that time I was not feeling good and I needed a doctor but they didn't take me because they wanted my medical record.... They need to focus more on costumer attentiveness and welcoming.< /Text>

<rate>2</rate><text>Cheap. Wait times are long but the price makes for compromise. Request any dentist besides the Indian lady when you pay. She's just there to make a buck, doesn't care to explain anything. Literally just came and started drilling in my mouth. I wasn't giving any sort of numbing cream or "laughing gas", so I was pretty shocked she just went in there and starting drilling into my tooth. I literally pulled away believing they had missed a step in my cavity removal process. I'm no punk but the pain caught me by surprise, she could have at least told me something. I would have given more stars but that lady pissed me off. I hear Dr. Phan is better mannered and overall a better dentist to be around, will request him on my next visit.<//text><user_name>Steve Rogers< /user_name>< response>

Highly unorganized, unprefessional, discourteous, and inconsiderate staff. Appointments are invaild. Clinic has you waiting for hours with or without appointment. Staff seems lost, unaware of their own procedures. Staff also seems disgruntled with one another, are uncooperative and unwilling to help with any question you may have. New staff needs to be hired immediately and trained properly. Consider other clinics before coming to this one. I know San Jose is a drive from Hollister but if you can spare the drive, Clinics in San Jose are better.</text>

<review>Unprofessional place!!

📍NO doctors
📍schedule  is always full
📍They wont give you a Rx refill, even though their appointment  schedule is full.
📍They'll  charge you $20, if you choose  to leave, because you've been waiting for 2 hours and haft to go to work.
📍staff will yell at you, and give you attitude, gaby is the worst.
📍they will schedule you  appointments, without your knowledge, then charge you $20
📍you'll always see new faces, new doc, MA's nobody last.
📍CEO is rude, doesn't care about the pt, just the $.

📍They are always hiring people with no expiriance, one day I saw a MA help me in the MA side. Then for my a dental appointment, she was assisting my doctor. in the dental side, then when I had my vision appointment the same girl, was taking my measurements in the vision side and assisting the vision doctor,
📍but the reason I left, was because, one girl DREW MY BLOOD and couldn't find my VEIN! they stiked me 5 times, then anorher girl came to help and she couldn't  find it eather. They ended up drawing blood on my hand, it left me with a HUGE BRUISE, both in my arms, and my hand! I was in so much  pain, and felt a numness sensation.
📍when I requested my medical records it took them 4 months, to give them to me, and they still had the nerve to charge me $25.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Terrible. It's not just terrible, but the people ... SO IGNORANT. The doctor...idk. I guess she wish she worked else where. Everything about this place... disturbing. They call you at least four times a month to try to get you to come in for something you don't need. They will bill you and penalize you when you don't even NEED the insurance. Then when you go and actually USE THE INSURANCE, You go to a hole in the wall that tells you to go to another hole in the wall ALL THE WAY in San Francisco, yet you have had that illness for over 13 years, and YOU LIVE IN HOLLISTER. I too had the Indian lady seen in that pic. Lord have mercy on her sole.<//Review>

Stay away from this place.  There is criminal activity going on.  When you call they never inform you of anything concerning cancelations or standard procedures--there are financial crimes happening and it seems like no one is doing anything about it---please call any watchdog group to begin an investigation---I urge you to investigate since most people who go there that are being preyed upon are poor and sick who need the help---most probably have no way of defending themselves.< /text>

This is very important - if you can avoid this place please due. It is unsanitary, unfriendly, the wait is super long, and get this if you call to talk to billing there is no one to tal to you have to make an appointment to come in in person. It is really the absolute worst ive ever been to.

I took my two kids to the dentist and was told they had several cavities. I decided to get a second opinion and was told my daughter only had one which didn't even need to be filled since the tooth was falling out soon and my son had none. NOT A ONE. This place is a scam.<//Text>

I have been here several times and it is horrible. I have had to wait over an hour to be seen three times. I had fillings done and at the site of one my gum got infected and I might need to have my tooth extracted because of it. I was there today for a cleaning and waited almost an hour while two people who came in after me were helped before me. I asked to speak to the manager and he was useless. He never introduced himself and was on the defensive the whole time. Four times I have called to find out about obtaining my dental records and never got a call back. They say I owe them $20 for a cancelled appointment even though I was there but left when it was 20 minutes past my appointment time because I could not wait any longer and there was two year old in the lobby having a tantrum. Not one staff member had the sense or the caring to ask one of the child's parents to take her outside while the other one dealt with reception.</review>

<date>1434227667529< /date><text>The absolute worst place you can go to. No real medical professional ever on staff and the accounting department is incompetent unprofessional and ignorant.  My child was turned away with a high fever  when we showed up for an urgent appointment due to an alleged outstanding balance and though we argued that it had to be a mistake because we've had coverage through my husband's employer they were completely inept and simply said we needed to take our child somewhere else.  A few weeks after that horrible experience I contacted their accounting department requesting an account statement which was at that point corrected and adjusted proving it was a processing error. But after many attempts to reach someone in management regarding the incident I got nowhere and it is very clear that nobody else cared.
If you are thinking about going here for any reason my recommendation is you keep looking for some place else.  This place is a nightmare to deal with!</text><UserId.>102976158534059523193</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

I could not believe what poor customer service I received from most of the health clerks. I needed a referral and the staff were completely incapable. They referred me to a Doctor who didn't accept my insurance and when I brought it to their attention they referred me to another Doctor who also didn't take my insurance.They avoided my calls and when I went in to ask for the clerk who was helping me they all lied and said she wasn't in day after day. I finally had to call my Blue Cross provider myself to be referred. They never apologized. Also, my children and I have arrived for appts and we've been told,"Sorry the Dr./Dentist won't be in today", and the few times I missed an appt. we were charged $20. I've asked to speak to someone in charge repeatedly and some clerk, 'Irma' tells me she's in charge and is completely rude and GHETTO!!!! I just found a new health care provider and dentist for my children and I.<//Text>

I would have been nice if they told me before I drove there to tell me they didn't take my insurance making it very difficult to find another doctor to see after wasting half my day for the appointment there< /review>

(Translated by Google) Horrible service, they quote you one hour and attend you two hours later or if they do not say that the system was gone and they do not have adequate control of the arrival of people. There are almost no people to take so long it is really desperate.

(Translated by Google) Terrible service!!!! They believe they have the right to dispose of my time when they call you at 2 in the afternoon and spend 40 minutes without even appointing any person or doctor or dental ... I just go and they will charge me because I "cancel the appointment" when One shows up but they are the ones who do not feel like not attending to you ... I wonder why I quote many people if they are going to be in a lunch or doing I don't know what ... lousy attention ... hopefully the 20 Dollars that they charge serve them for more training or something

(Original)
Pesimo servicio!!!! Se creen con el derecho de disponer de mi tiempo cuando te citan a las 2 de la tarde y pasan 40 min sin siquiera nombrar a ninguna persona ni medico ni dental.. simplemente me voy y me van a cobrar porque "cancele la cita" cuando uno se presenta pero ellos son a los que no les da la gana de no atenderte... me pregunto yo porque citar a muchas personas si van a estar en lonche o haciendo no se que... pésima atencion... ojala los 20 dolares que cobran les sirvan para mas entrenamiento o algo asi<//Text>

Bad service. Tried to call to see if an order had arrived for testing. Was on hold for 30min before I got disconnected automatically. Tried calling two more times. First one was disconnected before hitting the nurse, then the second call went to their voice mail. These people can’t even look up a single order.<//Review>

Patients need to be more patient with everybody because of pandemic--theres a wait no matter where u go.  People need to be nicer to others--look yourself in the mirror.  There was a large number of people waiting. I had an appointment at 1:45 and had to wait about 40 minutes. I didn't mind because of covid 19, the tech's most go thru more clean up between patients. If yr in a hurry, don't go till u have more time. Kindness to others make u feel better.</review><user_name>Wanda Stroup<//user_name><user_id>100376324715104816176<//user_id><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Be Prepared to Wait for Hrs. 15mins becomes an 1hr. And so forth .REALLY slowwww! Feel bad for old people and people with a walker. Be prepared to wait outside in a longgg line too. MAKE AN APPOINTMENT, if you can. And be prepared to be here all day; so come here with enough time.</Review>

The staff in the front is exceptionally polite, professional, and great at their jobs. Today, they were in a rush while the office was packed, early in the morning under stress from having to socially distancing every patient, but they managed to be extremely respectful and professional. Special thanks to Natty, who took my blood, in the back for staying positive and upbeat under these super stressful circumstances.</Text>

On LabCorp website, it is posted that this foothill Boulevard office is closed at 4 PM when it’s not! Change and update your website accordingly!
So many people went up to the door including myself to get blood work done for nothing! Waste of time! If you close at 3 PM, putting a piece of paper on the door is not professional. You need to have it on your website!< /text>

If I could give this place less than 1 Star I would, even with an appointment there’s still a 30-60 minute wait, if you walk in you can expect to be outside for over an hour, the bald guy with glasses at the front desk is very rude to everyone without an appointment and that’s just an observation because I wasn’t one of the unfortunate people waiting outside, save yourself some time and go to a different location</text>

<Review>Terrible place. No explanation. Not welcoming. So slow process. I would not want to come in again if I have a chance to select the place. I came a few minutes before 1pm and it is 1:54pm and I am still waiting for my turn. CRAZY and TERRIBLE. If you are sick and need a blood work, DO NOT COME HERE BECAUSE YOU WILL BECOME MORE ILL DUE TO ENDLESS WAITING HERE!!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Folks if you want to come here because is closer to your house don’t do it, it’s not worth of your time.
They keep you waiting for minimum of good 20 min
Staff are rude to people and they don’t have professional manners.
Skip the headache by not coming here<//Text>

<text>Two stars because once in awhile I do run into a competent employee. There is one specific nurse (if I ever get her name I will update this review to include it) that ALWAYS leaves me a bruise that last at least a week after she draws blood for me. This last time I went, I have no idea what they did with my blood and paperwork, but they say they don't have it, and yes, guess which nurse took my blood that day. I really wish the doctors would start sending me to a lab that's at least mediocre when it comes to competence, as opposed to this one where mediocrity is too much to ask for.

Edit: she was not wearing a name tag, but she grabbed a lab coat from a hanger that said: "Mitchi." If you could please post her schedule so that I make my future appointments on days/hours that she's not there, I'll raise you one star.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I suggest making an appointment but they were booked up until 2 weeks later so I decided to walk-in. I arrived at 7am without an appointment and left about 45 min later which is very reasonable in my opinion considering how many people were there. I suffer from "white coat syndrom" and was having some anxiety but Gina was so comforting and reassured me everything would be just fine. She gave me water, let me relax in the chair before getting up and was just really great all around. Thanks for making this visit so easy and stressfree.</Text>

Short wait, go early morning and you won't have a problem.  Clean space and friendly phlebotomists. They get a 4star because the front staff aren't the sweetest, but no harm comes out of it.<//Text>

Went to get my blood drawn this morning. These people don't care about patient confidentiality at all. One lady gave my patient paperwork to someone else because they walked up to her counter. She didn't verify any of the information to make sure it was the right patient. Luckily, I knew the order of the patients to know it was my name. I was super disappointed. And when I was getting my lab work drawn from my hand, the guy drawing my blood started dripping sweat all down my hand that he was drawing blood from. Service today was not up to par.</review>

This place is awful I came here about a month ago to have blood work done for my pregnancy  the guy pulls out like 8 tubes and when I ask what they for he just said becuz  ur Doctor  ordered it... well I start feeling woozy after he is done and he tells me I can't wait for a little because  they close at 4pm and it's now 4:01... I decided  to  go again today I get out of work early cuz they close at 4 I get there at 3:57 and they won't let me in or let me talk to a supervisor... this place is very unprofessional and the people there are beyond rude....</review>

I'm rating this a 2, because I'm here for a urinalysis test and that's it. Why???? Do I have to wait so long??? There's a list of people that have to sign in and I'm wondering if we are called by where we are on the chart instead of what we are here for. All I want to do is pee in a cup and bounce, which should only take 1 to 2 minutes. I don't want to have to wait with people who have to do everything. I'm trying to not use the restroom on myself, and I don't want to use the restroom because last time my urine was diluted from drinking so much water. :( the staff is nice that's why I added an extra star.</Text>

Worst lab I have been too. I told the front desk that my lab order was placed electronically and he still kept on looking for a faxed order. Personnel  are rude, and  does not treat their customers right. Very long wait.Really  bad service, too many to describe.</text>

< Review>
I have a 30 year old disabled daughter, her veins are difficult to get blood from. The male phlebotomist said they have a max of 3 attempts at drawing blood. I have been there when they tried 6 times. I wish that he understood how difficult it is to keep coming back, it would be better if they kept trying to draw her blood. Instead I have to rearrange my schedule to go back again tomorrow. The guy was not friendly or apologetic, just said come back tomorrow. The women at least were nicer than he was.</Review>

Not enough chairs,  slow, rude and now in addition to ask their terribleness they are requiring a  credit card on file to bill for co-pays automatically even if you're not supposed to have a co-pay. This place is terrible. I wish my doctors office would let me use Quest :*(< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I've been here several times. The front desk customer service is unprofessional. Mostly due to the flamboyant Mexican guy at the front desk. He can always be heard expressing his opinion's to his coworkers. Once, he was talking to me and another employee at the same time while I was checking in, and he wasnt making eye contact with anyone.
Tip:
For bloodwork, you need to sign in at the clipboard, have your labwork order form and your insurance card ready so they can make copies. Wait at the front desk for your forms back, instead of sitting down and being called back to the desk after you've found a seat. I have a physical disability and didnt appreciate their lack of check in explanation procedures.He also does "little things", like tells people have a good day when they are leaving, and have already walked past the front desk, and are halfway out the door...expecting people to turn back. I ignored his words because he could have wished me a nice day while I was inside the building, instead of waiting until I was wrestling with the door.  If this job is these people's bread and butter, they need to treat people with more respect. Patients like me see these people month after month and recognize that they are not genuinely nice people, and haven't changed for the better. It's dissapointing. I suspect these people do not love their jobs, and only show up for the paycheck. Almost makes me wish a machine would take my blood sample, instead of a human with an attitude. These people are not mature enough and simply too selfish to be working in the medical field. Wrong, wrong, wrong.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>I've only been to this location a handful times for myself and my children. The first couple of times I was very hesitant because of all the bad reviews, but it was the closest to me.
Each time I've been in an out in less than 45 min. I've gone on a Saturday. I've gone during the week in the mornings.
And today I went right after work and I was literally in and out in like 15 min tops.
I give it 5 stars because of the phlebotomist that drew my blood today. I forgot his name, but he looked new and I have to say he was very kind and professional. In all my years for as far back as I can remember I've always been a tough draw. I've had phlebotomists poke and dig a few times before giving up and calling the next person. I've had phlebotomists at hospitals and doctors offices ( that staff would refer to as "the vein rangler" or the "vein expert" even the "vein whisperer") poke around. The good ones would only poke twice, but the rest were pretty bad. So I've accepted that I'm just a hard stick. I even got over the multiple pokes, but today the nice guy with the dreads (I really wish I could remember his name) got my vein on the first try! And he didn't have to dig the needle around either. Had the boss not been on the phone I would've stopped to have a chat with her.
Very EXTREMELY happy with my service today!!</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

These people are terrible! Every time I come the wait is almost an hour, sometimes even longer than that! They are horribly understaffed and the patients are the ones that suffer! Prepare to spend a good chunk of your time standing because they don't have enough chairs for all the people they make wait FOREVER!<//Text>

The front desk was to busy on his personal cell phone when I was asking about my sick daughters  lab orders. It’s so sad to have to deal with this. They have no idea how sick people are and want to give no care in the world or offer to help with contacting the doctors after they notice you been sitting in here for a few hours with a sick kid.< /Text>

Wonderful burgers! Yorker was awesome. Not a whole lot of wait for the order. The burger was huge and very tasty. Lots of choices but couldn't try anything else. Would certainly recommend.<//Text>

<text>You go to a Halal place bc you expect to be treated the halal way. My order was missing an item. The kitchen staff did not even mention that it was missing. I had to return and tell them. They said they ran out of it. In the future, you have to tell me that something is missing. Just common sense.

Staff is friendly. Here is what I suggest to make this place better.
1- Make the sizes bigger. Why tiny, baby-sized coleslaw containers? Also, it is not good at all. You're charging prime prices so I expect prime sizes and sides.
2- Why are fries not a side? Everywhere in the US it is a side. So, make it a regular side.
3- Why only three small sauces with a bucket of chicken? Make them at least 6, two of each sauce.
I hope things change. Food was a little above average. Sauces are excellent.</text><name>Homs Chess< /name><rating>2<//rating><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

<resp>None<//resp><text>Delicious! This place had been on my radar since last year, just hadn’t made the time. Went there Sunday morning when they first opened and ordered a five piece bucket. (My first mistake was not ordering more!) he suggested a side of mashed potatoes. Took it home while my wife and I nibbled it in the car, definitely fresh and screaming hot. My second mistake is that I neglected to take a pic before digging in. Once I started I could hardly stop.

I tried bouncer burger and howzat fried chicken here. It is really worth for very penny you pay. Burger was very appetizing and amazing. I upgraded it to a meal so they added small size fries and gave me an option to choose one can soda. Howzat fried chicken bucket is also sold in 3 and 5 piece combinations you can request for it while you are ordering. The person at the counter was very humble and friendly. You should try their menu at least once, you will definitely love it 😍🍔🍟🥤🍗🤩</Review>

<text>Always been very pleasantly welcomed here and the host is very polite.  Current menu is limited but more limiting is their Facebook approach to the place.  Restaurant website is only on Facebook, updates for the place are also only on Facebook like addition to the menu.  Food is really good, for the burgers their week point is the buns which can be a hit or a miss depending on the day.  They are using Door dash for delivery but found the menu either limited or outdated to what they have to offer (again they seem to be focused on Facebook only).  They accept all credit cards and have NFC payment system for no contact payment.< /text>< date>

Friendly nice Employee, but when it comes to the sandwiches, the cheese does not melt. Literally ate the food 5 minutes after it was handed to us and it was already getting cold. Besides that it was good!</review>

<text>We were parked at the plaza where Halal Fried Chicken is and saw a bunch of people getting food from them so we tried it. First, I don't really write reviews but our experience was so amazing I decided to make one. We ordered the bouncer and yorker, both chicken sandwich but it taste uniquely from each other. Perfect bun to chicken ratio and spices. The owner was so nice, friendly and attentive to all customers. We ended up buying to-go to bring home to the fam. Definitely will be back again.

Its a HALAL Fast Food Pakistani restaurant located in Sunnyvale. They serve Burgers, Fried Chicken, Wraps and Fries. They name their menu after Cricket which is interesting for cricket lovers. We had Yorker Burger, Fried Chicken and Loaded Fries. Food was finger licking good and reminds me of KFC :) back im my country (as here in US KFC doesn't serve Halal). Restaurant owner was amiable & also concerned about their customers. We had our food at their dinning out tables. As far as talk about dinning area, it didn't inspire me at all but in Covid situations it doesn't matter as much. I will definitely have food from there again.< /Review>

The BEST fried chicken in the area!! After I tried the fried chicken here, there’s no going back to Popeyes or KFC. I love their wings, thighs and drumsticks. I didn’t care about the chicken bread. Wraps are also very good. I highly recommend the food here.<//Review>

4.5 stars. Ordered from doordash. I love the crispy chicken. The meat was tender and juicy. I especially love the tiny bit of gingers bursting in my mouth. It was very refreshing. I opted out for ketchup. I'm not entirely sure but it seems that they still might have used thousand islands source or some other pre-made commercially available sauce/paste. That artificial flavor really threw me off. It probably works for most people, but not for me. I'll definitely try again.</Review>

< Review>
Place is new but the food is mediocre. Family owner run restaurant, but there are alot of discrepancies when it comes to what is considered a side item and what comes with your meal. You cannot substitute anything and there are certain things that are not on the menu like fries, which they do offer but you cant get it in your meal or substitute for it. Chicken itself is bland with alot of "shakenbake" used. If you want spicy they just put crushed red peppers to the mix on top of it. Not worth the hype or the price.<//Review>

As friendly as the owner seemed, and as helpful as he tries to be he doesn't listen. Confused the order 3 times and in the end, then disagreed. As for food average but didn't get what I ordered, doesn't listen to instructions and strange service unfortunately.  Wish him the best but if he keeps this up then it will go downhill from here.</Review>

<review>Tried the Bouncer with thigh meat. Very close to the Zingers from Pakistan but still missing something, can't put my finger on it. I'd still recommend it highly though! The crispiness is spot on!
They didn't have fries at the time and the person at the restaurant couldn't work the checkout counter so I had to go to Taj Mahal and get exact change for my order but I understand these things happen with a new business.
The staff was very nice albeit had a little trouble with English. She was part of the kitchen staff (not the checkout) and the only one there so we had figure out a way to communicate. Worked out in the end. Good food.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Good food alhamdulillah, side note: Speaking of other restaurants, sometimes I lose respect for Halal places when I see them giving into selling alcohol or have music blasting.. or even inappropriate things on TV playing. I've experienced this many times at many different halal food* restaurants. Alhamdulillah none of that was the case with this restaurant. It was pleasant to hear Qur'an being played from a distance of 10ft from the restaurant door. The owner was friendly, said Salaam and gave good service. Much respect. The chicken in the sandwich was also good alhamdulillah. I felt the pricing was a little bit expensive, but maybe that's just how it is with getting halal chicken and all. I haven't been to that many fried chicken places to know competitive pricing.</text>

The chicken is crispy and the bun is huge. Good serving size and sauce is delicious but hoping they have more sauce for the burger.<//review>

Went in for an ink cartridge this evening and had a hard time finding staff to help. There were many gaps on the display shelves where products used to be, a lot of shortages. The staff I finally interacted with were very friendly and helpful, though.< /Review>

Arlo security cameras are pricey but worth every cent for the peace of mind it gave me. However the batteries don't last for 6 months if you have a lot of camera activating movements but they recharge within 3 hours and you put them right back up.< /text>

I'm 2 for 2 so far, I know they good products there. I've yet to one that works for my purpose.
Purchased the Go Pro 7 didn't work so took it back within the 14 days return policy.
And yeah, no problems
Got a full refund for everything I purchased.<//Review>

If you live close by, then this is a good selection. Otherwise,  go to their Pasadena location with better inventory.  Customer service is top notch at both locations.< /Text>

<Review>Seems there could be more associates to help customers. Very high ceilings. 1 hour wait for computer assistance and 20 minute wait for mobile phone assistance. But when you do get help, they are really good.< /Review>< time>

Weird business model.  You are roped into a corral upon entry and a sales person insists on knowing your phone # and what you will be buying so he can "assign you a salesman.".

After a minute of arguing I was allowed into the store unattended.  Free to explore on my own, I bought a TV.< /Review>

I needed assistance and I couldn’t get anyone to help me with a question on a gift card I was buying . I kept getting oh sorry let me find someone who can help you I don’t work this department. It would have been ok if they actually did what they said they were going to do . Employees to busy taking to each other sounded personal .</review>

< Review>
I placed an order online and directed me to pick up at the stores. At store they surprised me saying my order not available and suggested to buy the similar product at the present stores price. Which is ~40% higher than earlier online sale price. They defend it saying physical store and online (•com) are entirely independent companies!. Customer service on phone said today is the last chance to pick up the product and will be refunded if not picked up.<//Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>This review is of the geek squad supervisor. I've been a BB customer for many years and they have a record of this. I've spent thousands of dollars there. I couldn't get through to them on the phone so I went in on Monday to transfer data to an external HD. I was told sorry: appt. Only. No problem, say I and I come back on appointment day. Now it turns out you don't pay when your job is done but in advance, and you "get to" sign up for an annual membership. I had not brought a cc with me. I asked if there was any was I could bring my cc with my when I picked the digital media up. The nice young lady kept returning with a " no sorry, those are the rules". You'd think in these
challeging times businesses would work with customers. I am in the process of finding a #smallbusiness that will take my money and not be so rigid.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d908d8426e4f:0x73be050fc7c64ee0</gmap_id></record>

The store is clean and has an open layout. It is easy to navigate. The employees are helpful and don't hover while you are shopping. I deducted 1 star because there are many items that need to be reordered.< /review>

< Review>
Drove an hour out of the way to buy an open box AV receiver that we labelled on the Web site as having all it's accessories with no cosmetic damage. Arrive and it has no cosmetic damage and also no accessories. We ended up spending more money on a less quality receiver because Best Buy can't be bothered to pick up their phones to answer a simple question OR get the information on the web site correct. You barely have anybody inside your stores. You can do better and stop with the excuses.< /Review>

I don't mind that they didn't have what I was looking for, but I was appalled that I was ignored by several workers who were standing around or sitting while I asked for help at two different locations *and* waited at the Customer Service desk. I don't expect reliable service at any Best Buy, but my experience at this location was abysmal compared to all other visits to other stores.</text>

<pics>None</pics><text>I went to purchased 2 Galaxy 20 cell phones I i at Best Buy, The reason I went to best buy to purchase these cell phones as I had purchased 2 Galaxy 9+ and 8+ cells phones i was out within an hour. This time it was a fiscal it took over 2 1/2 hrs. The rep did not know her job she continually had to ask another rep what do do, also all the info she explained as far as the total I would be paying was wrong i had to go to Verizon to straighten out the mess, what really got us upset was she left just prior to finishing the contract she asked another rep to finish up for her. You need to train your reps also courtesy doing business much needed.
Unfortunately I will not be doing business with Best Buy.</text></record>

A little disappointed 😞. Not stocked very well ( I know, covid times). We looked for air purifiers(not much) and at computers. Beside being greeted at the door. No one else asked if we needed assistance. I saw plenty of employees talking and assisting others. Not mad, just disappointed 😕.< /review>

I really thought,  when I scheduled a site survey, this was a great Idea so I could get the best advice for the security of my home and family. This is what was advised by a Geek Squad agent for best outcomes of a great security system.
To my surprise,.....the day came, mind you I waited at least 2-3 weeks for this appointment, and  I continued to wait. It wasn't until I called twice on the day of the appointment and spoke with a representative of geek squad and found out that my appointment had been canceled 2 or 3 days prior without any explanation to me. At that time the representative named Garrett Gray stated he would get a hold of the supervisor in charge of site surveys to see if they can schedule me in today. After waiting four more hours and now 3 in the afternoon with no call back from either representative, I can only say that this is a great disappointment and,... unfortunate that they manage their customer service this way. They have lost a customer that initially honored their service.<//text>

<Text>Slightly slower store compared to some other best buys so you always have someone available to help you out with any questions you may have. I've been helped out my Manny several times who works in the mobile department but he knows a lot about other products! Always look forward to being helped by him.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I waited for help to purchase a lap top for 30 minutes in a mostly empty store. There is no system  in place to ask for help - like a service button. There's no way to make sure I get help before someone who came in after me, like a help ticket. When entering, you are told "someone will find you". Very discouraging.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Customer service needs improvement. I ordered something online on 12/24/19 and to my surprise, the iPhone charger I purchased was a used charger. I discovered this on 01/14/2020 when I decided to use my charger while on the train. Charger was not charging . Today I went back to the store to exchange it, and to my surprise, they said I couldn’t return nor exchange it. I don’t really shop at Best Buy and wasn’t familiar with their 14day return or exchange policy. The cashier gave me a nasty look like if I was trying to steal something. I then asked to speak to the manager, which she called, he was kind enough to override and do an exchange but they charged me the difference in price. Originally I paid 14.99 for the charger online with a free four month subscription to Apple Music  , and in the store it’s 19.99 with no subscription. I then told him to please refund the money back to my card  because it was unfair that I received something used and now I have to pay the difference, it was either that or nothing as he explained and I was forced to pay the almost five dollar difference . Their employees should check items that are returned instead of just reselling these items to the public. If I choose to buy something again I will inspect it there in the spot. I’m very dissatisfied with the way the manager handled the situation.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1579194576393, 'text': "Hello Betsy, thank you for telling us about your recent visit to our Duarte location.

<Rating>1< /Rating><time>1575942664243< /time><Text>Today 12/9 early morning I took my grandson to have the battery replace in his iPhone 6s, the employee at the front was very helpful and directed me to the Greek squad counter. There was no custom in the area in the morning, the Tech there said he was sure he had a battery, but he was to busy with repairs, so I would have to make an appointment to have a consultation and then they would schedule to replace the battery, but that would take another 24 hours before we would get it back. Needless to say we walked out as I was trying to have the iPhone battery replace as a gift for my 11 year old grandson. I still like shopping at Best buy so I am not going to let this stop. But since they have this rating tool I thought I would use it.<//Text>< username>

<text>I don't know it's just poor Management or training , but almost every time I have interacted with this location's geek squad  it's always misinformation or poor service. The first time my brother and I went to purchase the last screen protector. We had a geek squad member assist us. The first time he messed up and I understood that, but what I got annoyed by is how he tried to be sneaky about it.  I watched him go to the screen protector aisle and grab another which turned out to be the wrong size because he went to get another one. He then asked my brother and I if we knew the correct model of our phone, he insisted that our phone was a different model which that took 10 minutes. ( Which could have easily be figured out if he had just looked on the back of the phone) 😂😂😂 Fine, not everyone can do everything correctly. But, if you can't do it just find help. This whole ordeal took a solid 2-3 hours, just to get a screen protector on. The other time is today, I attempt to call this location on multiple extensions only to find out that the geek squad is the only department there that actually picks up their phones. I don't normally complain , but being sneaky with my money and refusing to check your information before arguing with a client . Then today, I spent a solid 20 mins calling extension after extension. Waiting on hold for around 3  mins with each call , just in case if they are actually busy, but no one answered. Finally, decided to call the geek squad since they have to be next to phones to schedule appointments. Maybe it's due to the virus that there are less staff. But I think calling 3 extensions with one only picking up? Maybe the location needs to edit their voicemail extensions.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2d908d8426e4f:0x73be050fc7c64ee0</gmapID></record>

I tried to purchase a printer for my office. I got next day delivery. They tried to deliver it after we were closed. They called me on Sunday saying they had my package at their store and asked me if I still wanted it. I arranged for them to deliver it on Monday between my business hours. The package did not come. I called on Tuesday after receiving an email saying there was a delay in my order and when it is available they will ship it to me. I called the store. Got to talk to someone and she said she had to transfer me. Well she put me back to the automated telephone service and it would have been at least a 15 min wait to talk to someone. Since she didn't tell me why I was being transferred or to whom, I hung up and called back. It took me 7 min to talk to an actual person. After she looked up my account, she put me on hold to see if they had my package back from the carrier. I have been on hold now for 16 min with silence. Horrible customer service! I have had bad service from other Best Buys before, this is the last straw. I will not be purchasing anything from them again. They are not the cheapest. I chose them this time because I needed my package on Saturday, Monday at the latest. Now my business is suffering because they can not get their act together.<//text>

<Review>I had a new radio put in by Spencer and he was THE BEST!!! Great customer service, very quick and efficient! Can't say enough about the great service I received! He was even willing to take me before my appointment if the 6pm person didn't show. Above and beyond! Thanks again Spencer and Best Buy!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>Never buy open item appliances here. Their return / exchange policy is now only 15 days. By the time you hook it up and test anything, in this case dishwasher, customer service won't tell you if your policy has expired until you bring the item back. Once you've loaded up the dishwasher, bring it back as instructed, the same customer representative will only then realize the item is over the return policy and only then will inform you that you have to go through manufacturer warranty. This is after you bring them the receipt and paperwork on a previous visit on the same day to verify whether it's even worth your time unhooking, loading and attempting the return. Even when they tell you "yes, bring it  back and we'll exchange it", don't believe them. Or else, be prepared to make a roundtrip with with an appliance that you couldn't even return / exchange to begin with.</Text><GmapID>0x80c2d908d8426e4f:0x73be050fc7c64ee0<//GmapID>< UserId.>

My mother went to Best Buy to buy an iPhone , she is an older women. She asked for help to find the iPhones. They didn’t take her purchase seriously. She didn’t get to purchase an iPhone due to the lack of help she was given. I guess they thought she couldn’t afford one . She will be looking else where for an iPhone .<//review>

<text>Good location, not overly big but easy to get to, and with very friendly and helpful staff. Prices are good, in line with other stores of the chain, but the staff seems to be a bit more helpful and knowledgeable in this store. Cashier is weirdly hard to find, and probably the less friendly of the team, but overall a pleasant shopping experience.</text>< pics>

<text>Store refused to return a watch that i purchased a few days before from another best buy. They told me i need to go back to the original store, which is totally false. Ask to speak to manager and now was told system was down. BS<//text><username>trade Wars< /username><UserId.>101674058514438452064<//UserId.><Time>1547225727717< /Time><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I went for 3 things: a Solo brand backpack/briefcase, a Boogie board LCD writing tablet, and a new phone case for my LG Stylo 4.
Got the Solo backpack. Even though it was on sale, I paid more than I would have if I had it shipped in one day via Amazon.
Also, they didn't carry the LCD writing tablet they used to carry. They didn't carry any LCD writing tablets at all.
My phone has been out 7 months - I got it the week it was released for sale to the public from cell phone carriers - and they didn't have any cases for it.
Overall, 2 stars because I felt like 1 of 3 items made it a wasted trip, and the 2 separate  guys that "tried" to help weren't knowledgeable even about where my phone case would be located or about the phones on display.
The pic I added is of a phone on display that the guy who was in that section had no clue what it was and came over to "check it out", too.
Really disappointed in a store I used to really like.< /text>

Daniel helped my husband and I regarding the purchase of a laptop. He was very knowledgeable, courteous, and patient with us as we asked various questions. He also was very courteous while he would leave to assist other people while we tested various laptops. Excellent salesperson!< /Review>

Nice electronic store. Going through some remodeling when I was there. Helpful and friendly staff. I was looking for blue tooth speakers for my garage radio. They had quite a variety but were a bit pricey. Walked across the parking lot and picked up a pair of blue tooth speakers for my garage for 40.00 bucks at Staples . Best Buy had nothing for under 75.00< /text>

The good thing about best buy  is they will price match, the bad thing is it's really spread out and I always find myself at the wrong end of the store.  the last time I was there  I needed to buy an inexpensive keyboard and mouse I found exactly what I was looking for and the man that helped me was very knowledgeable. It's that kind of service that keeps  me going to stores rather than purchasing online<//Review>

10:05 am on Thursday April 29, 2021 and only 1 person working at Geek Squad. Why? Such poor management. 3 people waiting….Ryan refused to try for 1 minute to answer a question or 2 because he didn’t want to. Sucks!<//text>

I don't give 5 stars freely and this particular store earned every one of them. In the course of roughly 13 months I made a major purchase from just about every department in the store as well as repair work from the Geek squad. I'm not exactly easy when it comes to trying to sell me something. Doesn't matter what it is I do my homework and I want what I want. I'm armed with tech data, accessories available, price differences between brands and models, when I hit the store. I usually have whatever it is I'm shopping for down to a couple of choices. I then go to the store to see them in person and then make my final decision. The great thing about Best Buy's sales people is they don't work off commission so they're not pushing the most expensive items at you. They are very knowledgeable about the items you're shopping for and can point out the model that will best service your needs not their paycheck. In those 13 months I purchased 4 flat panel TV's, a washer and dryer, a fridge, 2 home computers, and a home theater sound system. There may have been a stove on that list but I won't swear to it. I received the same assistance from a highly trained sales person on every purchase. No pressure, no rush, no problems. It probably took 5 hours or more to finally make up my mind over what surround sound to. The sales person was informative with the answers to all of my questions and deserves a medal for putting up with me for so long. In case you're wondering I went with the Bose and love it. Each department has similar stories but the same happy ending. 5 stars, absolutely!< /Text>

I mean...it's Best Buy. You know what you're going to get when you walk in. Nothing out of the ordinary which is kinda what I'm looking for in a place like this.< /Text>

<text>I'm adding to my review as I recently purchased 2 Samsung  Note 9's.  The process for purchasing , transferring data, and setting up the phones was easy especially with Melissa's assistance.   All staff were very helpful.   I got the best discount going at this time for the phone better than the one Verizon was offering me a long time customer.   Great job folks.

Have bought several items here.  Staff are very helpful.  Literally got me a chair while showing me a product because I couldn't stand for long.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Staff was nice but as usual the printer ink I needed was out of stock entire shelf was empty, I have never been able to get separate packs or black & color inks, ALWAYS forced to buy multipacks of ink. Printer paper was down to one package of multi purpose paper. Looking for another source to buy supplies.<//text>

I always love shopping here because I walk around and check out all the latest items.  Most tje time i only buy ink and movies but i like seeing everything in person.

I hope brick and mortar stores like this will continue (very convenient pick up of items you order online ).< /Review>

<Text>The staff was helpful.  They only had one item left that I was trying to buy but I had wanted two. They located another store that had more and I bought both at this location and they held the remaining one at the other location.

The customer service representative (Alex) and the supervisor (Mr. Mejia) were superb. They were courteous, knowledgeable and responsive. They fully answered all my questions and offered additional pertinent information. I am excited about the TV items I purchased based on the the thoroughness of the staff's presentations, material provided  and the options provided.

No service wait time!<//Text>

<review>I frequent this store regularly and I am almost always disappointed in the service I receive. Employees will only offer help on occasion and the few times they've tried to help they were very unknowledgeable Scott any topic I've had questions about regarding there product line. Fortunately they don't have to be in order to take advantage of there awesome warranties! :-P</review>< pictures>

The store  managers were all off when we walked in at 8:45pm on 7/5/2017. We asked to confirm PC recycle program. The Geek Squad superior Gregg was impatient and  intend to be rude. Beware this  store.... Prefer Pasadena Best buy store.</Review>

I will be filing a complaint with the corporate office. After many years of great service, my husband and I were completely dissatisfied with our customer experience today. Team lead Beronica and customer service representative Maritza would really benefit from some customer service classes.  Bamboo principles,  Customer First Thinking,  etc. should definitely be on the top of Best Buys corporate training to do list. I have been  in the customer service industry going on 20 years and have trained, lead and supervised large groups of employees, so take my word when I say this was poor service.</text>

Purchased 3 new laptops for the start of our business.. I was so Greatful  because with the laptops.. Everyone was getting a new laptop to conquered different tasks. And we were able to find laptops to fit each person's needs. At affordable prices. The Salesperson was super helpful didn't try to just upsell us. Just listened. And made great suggestions. And after our purchase took it to Geek Squad. For them to have all updates down as well as different programs put on there. Just grateful thank you so much</Review>

Nice store to go to and close to home. Very nice people there who have always gone out of their way to be helpful they are knowledgeable as well. Even when i've returned things there... which isn't often... they have always been very courteous and professional and gave me quick refunds without any trouble. I'll always shop there!!!!! Just bought a HP laptop there for 329.00 and it's a great laptop.. very fast and works great.</text>

Good enough appliance selection to choose from. Service unquestionably attentive and the sales associate knows his stuff. Free delivery and take away the old. I could not ask for more.< /Text>

Some of the products they have on shelf I could find at other closest stores a few dollars cheaper, but I guess that's how best buy is still making money.

Update 2/3/2019
It was a three star review, but I am dropping it down to 1. Due to the miss information I was told today 2/3/2019. I had bought a dryer, told me that all hoses should connect to the dryer and all houses. Which that is false because my home is a old home. I will not purchase anything from Best Buy for quite some time now. I'll go to their competitor now.</text>< userid>

Super rude manager and return desk lady who first wouldn't let me return a defective phone bought 5 days ago because it had a scratch on the corner casing, saying that it was "no longer in new condition", but then was told "peace out"  afterward by the return clerk  with the manager right next to her like people say condescendingly after I became flustered at what just happened and decided to leave. Both seemed to know their excuse was a lie, but decided to hold their ground and stuck with it anyway like they had a beef with me, yet I was kind and decent with them the whole time. I'm shocked and feel compelled to go back and get their names to file a formal complaint.<//text>

<Text>One of my favorite places to go and spend money. I have been shopping at the Duarte Best Buy for more than 10yrs. I recently moved to IE and I will pass up every Best Buy to go to Duarte. The customer service is impeccable. That is a direct reflection of how that store is managed</Text><Date>1511216071381<//Date>< Pics>

<Review>Returns - you will be lied to.

When attempting to return anything that's more than $100 that you purchased at another store or online, you will receive any number of lies about how they cannot do it in store.  "Too high value", "There's a lock on your order", "You didn't buy it here".

These are all incorrect statements (lies) - BestBuy as a corporation will take back anything that they sell, at any location, at any time.  The location has their own local financials to deal with, and if they push you to a different location or returning online, then it doesn't count against their balance books.

When returning something and are denied, just stand there and quote this review and make them prove their statements, with a request for the GMs card.  Your return will likely be processed.

A suggestion: Since it hurts your centers financials, clearly communicate that and offer customers that come in an expedited way to return online - have boxes and printers ready to ship out.  Many of us are happy to do something like that.  Don't bald-faced lie.  That's just bad form.<//Review>< rating>

I feel like the employees are being brothered when I ask them basic questions (For example, "Can you tell me a little about this computer?") They rarely ever smile, and seem to avoid initiating interactions with the customer. A "Hi, sir, what can I do for you?" with a smile would be nice occasionally, but I can only recall getting that once or twice out of the many times I've come to this store. Disliked.</review>< time>

The quality of service Jennifer and her team delivers is consistent and wows me every time.  Although I live closer to a different Best Buy, Duarte is my preferred location and I always make an effort to drive here instead.  The team here really makes a difference and always keeps a friendly smile and attitude.< /text><response>None< /response></record>

Good store, only problem is that some of their items are way over priced compared to other local places. Also had a very limited computer parts selection for a Best Buy.< /Review>

I've called the geek squad so many times and they never answer.....same with the main line.  I have to go in to get my questions answered and the staff is friendly once I finally get to someone.  It's unfortunate.</Review>

<text>Nice knowledgeable staff.  Ready and willing to answer ALL my questions about Drones. Thank God they are real caring people. Love shopping at brick and mortar stores while the are still some left
Amazon wants to close the competition THEN watch the prices

I Ended up buying a drone and several components  .... and they found me extra battery at another store and had it waiting for me.  Even beat a competitive price I had found.  Will be coming back. Happy  Friendly people.
We all better keep shopping at the local stores. Before all that remains are coffee drive thrus. Fast food pickups or delivered food.   Speciality vegan Grocery markets, vet clinics, 7Elevens, 'Vape' shops,  pawn shops and bars<//text><resp>None< /resp><rate>4<//rate><Pics>None</Pics>< user_id>

< Review>
Went to buy an open box subwoofer after waiting over 30 minutes to get a sales person to help us. He called the manager to see if they could give us a better price and told me a cheap price was approved. Carry up to the the front cashier to be told a higher price by the manager with a bad attitude. Total waste of time. Better to shop on Amazon free shipping no hassle and better customer service if needed. I think the manager didn't care about customer service because it was like 5 minutes after closing very short impatient and rude. Can't believe how hard it is to find honest people these days. My experience was on 11/21/2017.< /Review>

<text>Horrible customer service.  My interactions with Geek Squad were very unsatisfactory. They don’t answer their phone, they don’t do what they say they’re going to do, they’re rude and inconsiderate, and they’re slow to complete minor repairs.   After I picked up my computer, I had to take it elsewhere to complete the repair I brought it in for.</text></record>

<text>The worst service of bestbuy I have ever experienced ! ! ! I went to buy my Fifa 18 with my gift card, but the employee scratched out my gift card pin number. They just keep typing the blurry number and let me wait for almost 30 minutes. Finally, they said I need to make a call to get my e-gift card and nothing they can help me ! ! ! I didn't feel any sincere apology from those employees at this incident.</text>< Response>

Best customer service from a retail store, or any store for that matter. I had an issue with a tv I was exchanging due to hardware problems having the delivery date pushed back twice so finally I decided to go in-store to do the exchange myself. The assistant manager Ignacio and Jennifer were a huge help! They had to do extra work because technically the tv was “in transit” although the delivery date was 7 days away. They spent ~30 mins to figure out ways around it because they knew I was a dissatisfied customer from the delivery experience but they find a way to make me a satisfied customer. Thank you to Ignacio and Jennifer!</Text>

<Review>A set of car speakers, one in the rear became defective after a few weeks. I bring it back and they replaced for free. After a long drive from Desert I thought of stopping off at BB in Duarte. Just to get a new LP, because I recall they have a clean restroom also.</Review>< Time>

It took to long to discover they didn't have what I'd came for.  The employees don't help you by giving suggestions of other products that will do what you need. You ask they answer walk away or you see them talking and laughing amongst themselves.<//text>

<Review>Stay away from West Covina car installation the guy there doesn't know what he's doing. Took two weeks and couldn't get the job done. I went to Duarte and the guy there got it done the same day in less time then he estimated. So if you want things done right the first time stay away from West Covina Best Buy and got to Duarte. City of industry helped me get an appointment on the same day with Duarte while West Covina didn't even bother with trying and instead got me scheduled for another week and a half but after to talking to city of industry they hooked me up with same day install. Thanks again city of industry and Duarte Best Buy and avoid the West Covina bs!<//Review>< Pics>

Worst customer service. Return policy is a joke, UNLESS you purchase their warranty, they can’t help! But why do I purchase these products from you. Ugggh so disappointing and now I have to deal with the manufacturer myself</text>

Poor management won't honor price matches that other Best Buys will! So if you're wanting to save a bit, make sure to do it at a different Best Buy.<//review>

I have been having a horrible experience with Best Buy.  I have made multiple attempts to do business here and take advantage of their price match guarantee and each time I have been given excuse after excuse why they will not price match.  First time  they claim that the advertised sale was for a single day when it sales it is good for 7 days, and I didn't arrive on the day the advertisement was issued, the second time I was denied because the competitor's website didn't show price in cart (because it was an in-store price according to the advertisement that was shown as proof) so they said it must reflect the price in the cart for them to match. Last time I showed them online the sale price for a couple of video games, the prices were clearly visible and still remained the same price when added to the cart.  All prior criteria was met, but I was denied because it said items available for pick-up only and can not ship to home.  Now they said the items have to show they are available for shipping, despite that I could drive and pick up from store that evening if I wanted.  Was trying to shop here and collect reward points and just use to really like the store.  But unfortunately their conduct has discourage me from buying anything here and have been shopping elsewhere.  Like always when you upset a customer bad testimonials follow to warn other customer of their bad faith conduct.<//Text>

<review>Poor customer service, tried to use Samsung pay and they asked for way to much information to buy a $30.00 Bluetooth earpiece. That's the reason for Samsung pay, Android pay and apple pay, one tap and go. Get with guys, this is the reason you are going out of business.<//review>< pictures>

Poor management won't honor price matches that other Best Buys will! So if you're wanting to save a bit, make sure to do it at a different Best Buy.</Text>

I understand how frustrating it can be not leaving a store with the item you need. Supplying the latest and greatest technology can me somethings aren\'t available in the store. To work around the limited capacity of our store, we offer Ship to Home and free Store Pickup. These options allow us to ship the item directly to your home or send it to our store and have it waiting for you. I encourage you to visit BestBuy.com and search for "Shipping" or "pickup" for more information on these options. If you have questions, concerns, or have more feedback to share, I invite you to email me at ReviewSupport@bestbuy.com. We appreciate you telling us about your experience, and I hope these options help you get what you need.\n\nBest Regards,\nMiller\nBest Buy Support'}<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2d908d8426e4f:0x73be050fc7c64ee0< /gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) The boys who serve at the cash register are spoiled, they serve reluctantly.
Neither is educated. They only speak English and with the mask they are not understood.

(Translated by Google) I bought a new iPhone at the end of last year and bought the katespade phone case at bestbuy. But it cracked naturally in a few months, and the quality was too bad to withstand the sun. A whole piece has to be dropped recently.

Down, go to the bestbuy to see if you can change, bestbuy said to find katespade, so I found katespade, then katespde actually kicked the ball and asked me to find incipio company. Believe

Many people bought a lot of katespade products like me, but they didn't think they had a problem. They handled it like this. The poor quality products didn't want to solve or even recall, but also deliberately

Pushing away and embarrassing. I suggest you not trust the katespade brand in the future.

The quality was too bad to withstand the sun. Recently, the whole back piece near to fall, go to bestbuy to see if they can change, bestbuy said

That I had to find katespade, so I contact katespade, then katespde actually kicked the ball and asked me to deal the problem to incipio

Company.
I believe that many people have bought a lot of katespade products like me, and I can not believe they treat the quality problems in this way.

They are not willing to solve or even recall the bad products. I suggest you not to trust the katespade brand.

去年年底我买了新的iphone,之后在bestbuy买了katespade的手机壳。但是没几个月就自然开裂，是质量太差无法承受阳光照射。最近一整片都要掉

下来了，就去bestbuy看看能不能换，bestbuy说得找katespade,所以就找了katespade，之后katespde竟然再踢皮球，叫我找什么incipio公司。相信

很多人和我一样买了很多katespade的产品，但是想不到竟然碰到问题，他们是这么处理的，质量低劣的产品不想办法解决甚至召回，还要故意各种

推脱和为难。建议各位以后还是不要再信任katespade的品牌了。

(Translated by Google) It has a lot of selection but they do not serve as they should be looking at you as if you were going to steal. But a worker never comes to ask if you are looking for something you have to look for someone who takes care of you always is the guard looking you from top to bottom but not He sends you someone to take care of you. Very bad service I do not recommend it

(Original)
Tiene mucha selección pero no atienden como deve de ser te miran como si fueras a robar .pero nunca se acerca un trabajador a preguntar si buscas algo tienes que buscar a alguien el que te cuida siempre es el guardia te mira de arriba a abajo pero no te manda a alguien que te atienda . Muy mal servicio no lo recomiendo<//Review>
