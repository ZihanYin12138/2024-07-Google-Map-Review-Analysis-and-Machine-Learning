This church is so amazing! I have been coming here since before the name change. My life was saved here on Dec 24th 2014 I have since joined the Worship Team, and now assist with coordinating the team. I as well help with the website. I pray that God guides you to your new home.</Text>

I’ve been attending this church for almost 9 years. When I came to Oxnard I came only with a duffle bag and luggage bag. They have loved from the moment I walked into the doors. I’ve developed not only friendships in this church but also a family. The pastors have been there for me, loved me, helped me, and encouraged in some of the hardest & darkest times of life walking with God. The worship is filled with God’s presence, the messages are encouraging, challenging & relevant. I’m grateful for this amazing church.< /review>

<review>I love my Church CityView Worship Church of Oxnard! Where we are encouraged to grow not only in Spirit, but in Education. Where we are encouraged to love, not to judge others and forgive anyone that might have hurt us in anyway. To give and have Faith that as we help our Church Grow our Family and loved ones are being taken care of by God Himself. (Seeing evidence of this recently)......Faithfulness is key NOT perfection,  because No one is perfect No not One</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1577761264294, 'text': 'Thank you Margaret for your review and rating!'}< /Response><gmapID>0x80e84e83e5955555:0x3aec5ddd635c3091</gmapID></record>

< Review>
God's presence has always been priority in this church. This church has helped me fall in love with Jesus at 18yrs old now I'm 31. I love the freedom I felt to lift my hands and worship God. I love that agendas and schedules and religiousness and routine could be throw away so that the spirit of God could move in the hearts of his people. I don't remember many messages or preachings, not that we don't have some of the best pastor's in the world!! What i alwasy remember about my church that I had an experience with God. Come and check it out for yourself!!</Review>

CityView Worship Church of Oxnard is an amazing church that always makes you feel welcoming and has tremendous sermons every Sundays at 10am. I have had the privilege to start with this church from the beginning and grow with it. If you are searching for growth this is the church to grow with. I highly recommend to walk into this welcoming glorious church when you have the chance.</text>

< review>
Christians are not to blend in with the world’s crowd but we should stand out in a crowd. God’s plan once we are saved is to change us to look, act, and think like Jesus. Our destiny and what He has predestined for us is to be fashioned and formed into the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29). His main process to accomplish this transformation is called the renewing of the mind (Rm. 12:2) (and saving of the soul James 1:21).</review>

<Review>This is a God ordained church with the focus on Jesus and His people. 2 hrs away from my house but worth the drive.
Want to really thank God for this church for being here for us during this pandemic.
Very safe and considerate.</Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< name>

<review>It's a wonderful place to praise the Lord. However, I do question one very important step of salvation that I have not witnessed being practiced here at City View. "Water Babtism" why do you not practice it? And if you do, how often is it practised? And why? Why is it not preached about either? It's biblical, therefore it should be preached about and it should be practised!!.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>Love this place. Highly recommend this smoke shop to everyone I know.  They have heat prices. Thick glass. And the workers are very polite and provide amaizing customer service. This is definitely a place you should check out if your ever in the city of whittier.</review>< Pics>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>good for picking up screens, papers other inexpensive brand name accessories but go elsewhere for anything more expensive, all inventory missing original packaging, branding (despite how forcefully the employees suggest they're the real thing) look and feel like chinese knock-offs, much of the ($20+) water pipes are named deceptively similar to actual glass manufactures to fool the uninformed, staff have difficulty speaking English, very "slimy" and predatory sales strategy (they would sell you a q-tip off the ground and swear to you with was a new Apple stylus if they could).

I had an issue with a purchase and tried to reach a resolution with the manager but he wouldn't have it, proceeded to scream at me, get in my face, threaten me.

they would rather make $30 and have a customer leave feeling highly unsatisfied and robbed, then cultivate a relationship and having a returning customer.

Just your traditional swindlers, the manager is unstable, i genuinely hope this establishment is shut down, but this business is probably the only thing keeping these people from breaking into cars and robbing people.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1449278347658, 'text': 'this is really made me laugh lol.......and i really dont know who you are and what  you are  talking about and we dont have employees i work for myself and by myself and i would like who see this review to stop by and see our customer service and our water pipes and our price and brands too and we have instagram page and yelp page too you can go and check us there this guy really he is a joke even he dont have a name and a pic i dont know if you are human even lol'}</response><gmap_id>0x80c2d3512fff9a71:0x842bdb74c75db230<//gmap_id></record>

Typical Chinese restaurant, similar to what may be found in Shanghai's old town gourmet districts. Mostly (but not exclusively!) spicy meals are served but the spicy level can be adjusted to taste. Generous quantities makes it very affordable. Plus, there are "order 4 get 1 free" types of offers which is perfect for family or friends dinners.< /review>

<review>This Place is great. I would highly recommend if you are interested in exploring diverse Chinese cuisine. It has both popular Americanized dishes like Kung Pao chicken and general Tso but also a large selection of more traditional dishes. All which are perfectly prepared. I have been here several times myself but most recently a took a Chinese friend and she loved it.

The peppercorn chicken is like an addiction. I can't wait for it to be served every time I order it. At first, I didn't know what the flavor description on the menu meant. Because, it said it has a numbing flavor. I thought it was a typo but you will be pleasantly surprised to find that it does have a nice mild numbing sensation after eating the Sichuan pepper oil that coats the zucchini and chicken. I truly think I'm addicted because I literally begin salivating when I see it knowing that I'll be getting that nice numbing effect.

This time, we also ordered the pork spam hot pot and it was delicious. And it's a huge bowl filled with a wide assortment of goodies and on the bottom was perfectly cooked glass noodles. It was altogether a real masterpiece.

These smaller places get so little attention but they blow away mainstream big name restaurants. I would like to keep it a secret but I really hope that it gets the recognition it deserves.< /review>< Time>

<review>Nice ambience and clean restaurant.  My colleagues and I ordered toothpick lamb and black pepper lamb. The meat that spicy moment used are white and greasy. It doesn't look like real lamb.
I would recommend that try nearby restaurant such as na jia café or taste of chanduge and compare. They use real lamb meat.</review>< pictures>

Food is great, but not service.  Waiters can't wait for you to leave so he just rolled the  leaning cart to your table as a sign to ask you to leave...  so I just paid less than 10% tips as a sign of disatisfaction; and I heard the waiter murmuring to one another: "Hey, their tips were not even 10%!" I giggled, that's exactly what I wanted!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) We are always in the mood for spicy Szechuan food.
We decided to try a new place – Spicy Moment.
This restaurant’s specialty is Szechuan dry pot.

We often want to eat Sichuan food very much, it is really spicy.
I want to try this new restaurant this day – outside the pot,
I heard that their signature dish is a dry pot.

* Special sour plum soup House Special Plum Juice | $2.95/Glass

Yelp check-in got us free plum juice.
The waiter brought us a big jar instead of two glasses.

We used the Yelp card to send two cups of sour plum soup.
The waiter sent us a pot directly, and the people are very good.

* Signature Chicken Silk Cold Noodle with Shredded Chicken | $6.95

We started the meal with cold noodle with shredded chicken.
The sauce was very tasty. We love the thin cold noodle.

Appetizers come first with a signature chicken silk noodles.
The cold noodles are delicious, fragrant and spicy.
Thin cold-faced teeth, like the Italian angel face, are delicious.

* Dry pot large intestine Dry Pot Pork Intestine | $14.95

There are a lot of choices for dry pot. We got the pork intestine one.
You can pick either soft intestine or crispy intestine. We got the crispy.
Then for flavor, there are hot and spicy, numbing spicy, and sour spicy.
For spiciness, there are mild, medium, spicy, and stupid spicy.
We opted for numbing spicy and medium.
We love the flavor of the dry pot. Lots of vegetables.
I especially like the soft potatoes. Dr. P loves the crunchy celery.
The intestine was cooked perfectly. Crispy and still have that chewy texture.
We would definitely come back for more dry pot.

There are many different choices in the dry pot, we chose the dry pot large intestine,
The large intestine is soft or brittle, we chose crisp,
Spicy, spicy and sour taste
Spicy, spicy, spicy, and spicy
We ordered spicy and spicy,
Their dry pans are really delicious and have a taste.
There are a lot of vegetables in it, I like potatoes most, and Mr. Park likes celery.
The large intestine is also very good, crisp and soft with a bit of chewy.
I really like this dry pot.

* Spicy Fish Fillet Numbing Spicy Fish | $12.95

Numbing Spicy Fish was truly numbing and spicy.
It was good, but very very spicy.
The fish was soft and very fresh.
There were some bean sprouts underneath the fish.
Very good with rice.

Spicy fish fillets are really numb and spicy, very tasty but really spicy.
The fish fillets are tender and fresh, with some soy sprouts underneath.
Very dinner.

We love the food at Spicy Moment, especially their dry pot.
Which dry pot should we try next time?

We really like the dishes outside the pot, especially the dry pot.
Which kind of dry pot do you want to try next time?

This restaurant’s specialty is Szechuan dry pot.

我們常常都會很想吃四川菜，真的很嗜辣，
這天想來試試這家新餐廳 – 鍋里鍋外，
聽說他們的招牌菜是乾鍋。

* 特製酸梅湯 House Special Plum Juice | $2.95/Glass

Yelp check-in got us free plum juice.
The waiter brought us a big jar instead of two glasses.

我們用Yelp打卡有送兩杯酸梅湯，
服務生直接送上一壺給我們，人真好。

* 招牌雞絲涼麵 Cold Noodle with Shredded Chicken | $6.95

We started the meal with cold noodle with shredded chicken.
The sauce was very tasty. We love the thin cold noodle.

開胃菜先來個招牌雞絲涼麵，
涼麵的醬很好吃，又香又辣，
細細的涼麵彈牙，蠻像義大利天使麵，很好吃。

* 乾鍋大腸 Dry Pot Pork Intestine | $14.95

There are a lot of choices for dry pot. We got the pork intestine one.
You can pick either soft intestine or crispy intestine. We got the crispy.
Then for flavor, there are hot and spicy, numbing spicy, and sour spicy.
For spiciness, there are mild, medium, spicy, and stupid spicy.
We opted for numbing spicy and medium.
We love the flavor of the dry pot. Lots of vegetables.
I especially like the soft potatoes. Dr. P loves the crunchy celery.
The intestine was cooked perfectly. Crispy and still have that chewy texture.
We would definitely come back for more dry pot.

乾鍋有好多不同的選擇，我們選了乾鍋大腸，
大腸又有分軟的還是脆的，我們選了脆的，
口味方面有香辣，麻辣和酸辣，
辣度有小辣，中辣，大辣，和變態辣，
我們點了麻辣中辣，
他們的乾鍋真的真的很好吃，味道有層次，
裡面還有好多蔬菜，我最喜歡馬鈴薯，公園先生喜歡芹菜，
大腸也炒的很棒，脆脆的又還帶點軟軟的嚼勁，
真的好喜歡這份乾鍋。

* 麻辣魚片 Numbing Spicy Fish | $12.95

Numbing Spicy Fish was truly numbing and spicy.
It was good, but very very spicy.
The fish was soft and very fresh.
There were some bean sprouts underneath the fish.
Very good with rice.

麻辣魚片真的是又麻又辣，很好吃但是真的很辣，
魚片很嫩很新鮮，下頭有些大豆芽，
非常下飯。

We love the food at Spicy Moment, especially their dry pot.
Which dry pot should we try next time?

我們很喜歡鍋里鍋外的菜，尤其是乾鍋，
下次來要試試哪種乾鍋呢？</Review>

No waiting. The Physical Therapist is well-educated, knowledgeable and listens to all my feedback. Highly recommended as a place to receive your physical therapist needs.<//Review>< Response>

I recently was released from having therapy here after months of appointments and I couldn't be happier with the outcome of it all. Every appointment started and ended with positivity. It didn't matter if I came in depressed, happy, crying or in pain. I always left feeling better, physically and emotionally. The friendliness and professionalism you experience here will make you feel comfortable and confident in yourself. The staff here, every single person, are there for you. They call you by name, always taking the time to address your needs. I want to say that I will miss the staff, they are really fantastic people. Thank you so much for being a part of my recovery, I will miss seeing you and can't tell you enough how much I appreciate you all. Joseph, Janice, Heidi and Michael - you all played different parts in my recovery, Thank You so much.< /Text>

I had a hip replacement and other long term issues that weren’t improving so I went to Terrapin Physical Therapy. I worked with Tri Nguyen for several weeks and I was very pleased with his knowledge and skills. I felt he truly listened to me and patiently worked with every complaint, encouraging me along the way. I will gladly work with Tri again in the future. Plus, I felt very comfortable in the facility. During this period with the virus they are very conscientious about wearing masks, taking temperatures, washing hands and cleaning equipment between clients. I recommend them highly.</Text>

Couldn't have been more pleased with the staff, the numerous hygiene protocols in place, or the facility. Excellent hydrotherapy pool. Terrific exercise machines and equipment. The space feels like home -- very comfortable -- which I did not know was possible at a PT place (I'm an athlete so have been to lots). I loved that aspect. My therapist, Michael, was attentive, a good listener, and creative, and the exercises he gave me helped me a lot. Heidi and Janis (sp?) at the front desk were exceptionally helpful and good humored. And, from the hand washing station at the entrance to the swift wipe downs of equipment, the fresh clean towels and bathmats in the pool area, and lack of other folks using the gym area or pool area while I did, I felt extremely COVID-safe. If I could give these folks an extra star, I would. I highly recommend this place.</text>< Pictures>

I have had lower back problems for much of my adult life. In late 2018 I had lower back surgery at Monterey Spine and Joint and was taking a long time to recover. It was suggested that I try aquatic physical therapy, which I did for 18 sessions at Terrapin. The facility is clean. Everyone there, especially Tony, was qualified and comfortable to work with. I improved day by day and now feel that my recovery is almost realized. I continue my physical therapy exercises at home and continue to feel better. I give Terrapin Physical Therapy credit for helping me recover.< /text>

My experience at Terrapin Physical Therapy (post op knee replacement surgery) has been extraordinary!  I have been especially impressed by the care and expertise of my therapist Tri Nguyen.  He did a very thorough evaluation, helped me set goals that I am thrilled to say I have reached, and went "above and beyond" to help me progress to where I am today.  He obviously loves his work and successfully strives to make a positive impact on his patients' lives.  The facility has strict COVID protocol in place which they follow closely.  A shout-out also to the other staff at Terrapin!  Janice and Juliana at the front desk are friendly, efficient and very welcoming.  Joseph has also been very helpful.  The aquatic therapy has been wonderful and the treadmill in the water certainly added to my success.  I highly recommend that you visit Terrapin when you have physical therapy needs!< /Text>

<Time>1600552650941</Time><rating>5<//rating><review>I wanted to do pool therapy after my hip replacement so my orthopedic surgeon send me to Terrapin and I'm very glad that he did. I really enjoyed my time there and thought that they did a great job.

One of the things that I really liked was that I always worked with the same therapist, Tri. Tri was great and asked me lots of questions about what my desires were for post-operative life, and came up with a treatment plan designed specifically for me. He always listened to what I had to say and then would modify a day's treatment to address any problems I may have had since my last visit. The treatments never felt rushed and I really felt I got the most out of the regime.

They also seemed to have a strict COVID protocol which they followed closely, so I was never concerned with catching the virus during a visit.

I would highly recommend Terrapin to anyone who needs PT on the Monterey Peninsula.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I went in to see Tony for lower back pain that was preventing me from doing my normal routine.  He was so professional, and is highly educated as he has a Phd in Physical Therapy.  Tony laid out a plan, and explained how the process works.  I followed his directions, and with his expertise, I was amazed at how quickly my back healed.  He helped me recover, and I am now able to do my normal activities.  He also has a very professional staff.  Juliana is very patient, and assisted me with my complicated schedule.  They also have implemented strict COVID safety protocols to ensure you are safe while at the clinic.  I highly recommend Terrapin PT if you want results!< /review>

< Review>
After an extremely intense and long bout with sciatica (in bed for 2 months), I was too weak to have a scheduled full knee surgery. Michael and Tony at Terrapin helped me regain my strength with pool therapy. I worked with Michael for 4 1/2 months and was able to continue with the surgery. Returned for more pool therapy after surgery also. This was a lifesaver for me. Far more effective and less painful on joints than traditional “land” exercises. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. Many thanks!<//Review>

Absolutely the best physical therapy team!! I went to see Tony in 6/2018 following my left shoulder surgery.  His knowledge and expertise is the reason I am able to live a normal life.  Shoulder recovery is very difficult physically and emotionally.  I recently had a rotator cuff repair on the other shoulder.  Again, he is my go to for therapy.  Keep in mind I live in Las Vegas and he is located in Monterey, CA.  He is extremely effective in person and virtual.  If I have any in-person rehab needs, I am happy to go to Monterey to see him.  He is awesome!!<//Text>

<Date>1588284386273<//Date><rate>5</rate><Review>I have been working with Tony post surgery on my big toe joint to address stiffness.  My surgeon wasn't happy with my wimpy version of self-help and said I'd better start seeing a physical therapist or I might not have enough flexibility to ever wear many of my shoes again.  That got my attention and I knew just who to see.  Tony had helped me with shoulder pain years ago so he was the guy I'd be relying on to make sure I can wear pretty shoes again.  It has been about two months now and I'm thrilled with the progress.  Between the work Tony does on my foot, Terrapin's wonderful pool and work-outs, plus the exercises he has me doing at home, I am back to doing everything pre-surgery and am pain-free.  My surgeon said I'm very close to getting a high heel clearance!!
Also....I was seeing Tony during the COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place.  Their office has taken every possible precaution, and I never once felt at risk.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

To enable an even more efficient and flexible therapy schedule, I received physical therapy sessions at both the Terrapin and Ripple sites.  The consistency and follow-through from site to site and therapist to therapist was excellent and provided an uninterrupted positive continuum of service.  That level of staff communication, in itself, was greatly appreciated.  Clear goals, focused activities toward outcomes, and constant, consistent ongoing education about my personal therapy from the therapists and aides kept my progress at optimum levels.  The hydro-therapy sessions were a powerful asset to my recovery.  The emailed exercise routines for home use were yet another tool to support my success.  Both facilities provided a positive and encouraging environment which supported defraying the 'oft times high stress of real and perceived hurt and pain that the road to recovery can bring about.  Nothing but high kudos and great thanks to the Terrapin and Ripple teams.< /text>

<Text>Best place I have ever been to for PT--Top of the line facilities--underwater treadmill. I was a college volleyball athlete for 4 years and been to many PT places for various injuries. This last injury I had was the most severe resulting in a kindner procedure foot surgery and a scope done to my foot. Following surgery I developed Complex Regional Pain Syndrome which brought on a number of additional issues. I came to Tony at Terrapin/Ripple unable to stand with crutches  for longer than 5 seconds and 3 months later left running. This was the best PT treatment I have ever had. Tony is very knowledgeable, their underwater treadmill and new equipment was top of the line, and they had weekend hours. I recommend to everyone, and I'm so happy I went to Terrapin and Ripple.

I just can't express enough how extremely happy I am with the treatment I received at Ripple Physical Therapy.  Nathan was my physical therapist and I would recommend him to anyone needing treatment.   He was kind, compassionate and very knowledgeable.  He took the time to teach me proper techniques which will be very helpful for my continued healing.  He seemed to take a sincere interest in helping me overcome my physical limitations.  Which, I feel I have done with Nathan's help.  Even Tony who was not part of my therapy often asked me how things were going and encouraged me to continue on.  And Lexie at the front desk couldn't be more of an asset.  She is professional,  courteous and just down right sweet as honey.  Don't let her go!  Overall I am extremely satisfied and am actually a little sad my time with Ripple is done.  I wish everyone the best.  Thank you Terrapin and Ripple Physical Therapy.  MDGAMOTAN< /Text>

I am so glad that I was referred to Terrapin!  I love the environment and the people- always so positive and friendly.  I had nerve and joint issues and I dealt with headaches on a daily basis. Working with Paul and Steve, they were so patient and encouraging in treating my symptoms.  They not only treated the immediate need, but also incorporated strength training and a home program for long-term support.

I love the little nuggets of wisdom they shared to help give me perspective and understanding. They are such experts in their fields and operate with great wisdom and insight.  Bottom line, I received great care, excellent support, and much needed encouragement to work through my challenges.   It was my first experience with physical therapy, and I am so grateful it worked out as it did. I'm ready for the upcoming hula season! Many, many thanks!<//Review>

I was referred to PT for ulnar nerve problems. I came away much better. Tony, my therapist was able to mitigate my symptoms by manipulation and by providing a number of exercises that I can perform at home. My personalized exercise plan is available on line, a great feature. Tony, the other therapists, and the office staff (Heidi) were extremely helpful. If your doctor gives you a choice of physical therapists, I highly recommend Terrapin.</review>

<Text>I worked with Tri Nguyen on my plantar fasciitis and he was able to help me make a lot of progress on the road to recovery.  His knowledge, treatment, recommended routines away from Terrapin and positive energy helped me through a difficult & painful injury.  I'm grateful I went there and worked with him and all the entire Terrapin team.  Great people, very helpful.  I'd recommend them to all my friends.<//Text>< user_id>

This is long overdue, I have been going to Terrapin PT for many times, I love the place the people are friendly, especially the owners, Tony and Heidi.  I recommend it all my friends. They  have a pool and all the exercise equipments. I only know two therapists beside Tony,  Steve, (who is no longer there) and now Tri. Great jobs guys. R< /Review>

< Review>
Terrapin Physical Therapy has been a very positive experience for me.  Nathan Kadlecek has been supported and has presented a very helpful therapy plan for me that I have been able to implement at home. I appreciate his one-on-one attention throughout my sessions as he worked with me to make certain I was doing my exercises properly.  I have found relief from my hip discomfort and I'm certain I will improve with time.< /Review>

Nathan was wonderful, listening to my concerns and creating a plan for my recovery.  The entire office staff was extremely professional, positive and encouraging.  Thank you Nathan!<//Review>< Pics>

I had a sore shoulder from using the kick board wrong in swimming class and Tri helped me.  We started by talking about my injury and Tri asked me what my goals were for recovery.  He kept those goals in mind throughout our sessions, which I appreciated.  Tri follows a very caring process and has a calming presence. Once I finished my 13 sessions, the owners, Tony and Heidi, offered me a gym membership where I went through my sessions and Tri taught me how to use every machine!  Great business, nice, educated and supportive staff!< /review>

Terrapin is the place to go for physical therapy--the facility is clean and modern (my favorite part is the pool), the staff is knowledgeable and attentive, and the treatment is really effective. I originally came to physical therapy at my Mom's request for my lower back pain and saw it as something to dread, but now it's something that I look forward to during the week. I come back not only because it makes my back feel better, but because I have fun. It's an amazing environment.< /review>

I had surgery to repair a ruptured Achille's tendon nearly 6 months ago. I began PT somewhat against my surgeon's wishes and it the best decision I ever made. I made super quick progress and thanks to the combined efforts of Paul, Katy, and Steve, I am back on the treadmill and expect to be back on the pavement very soon. Not only are they professional and pushed me to a safe limit both on land and in water, the staff at Terrapin are very courteous, friendly, and truly care about your well being. This was my first experience with PT of any sort and I'm glad that I went with Terrapin.<//Review>

<Review>I've had 3 hip surgeries (same hip), two back surgeries and numerous physical therapy sessions, including acupuncture, and nothing has helped as much as the water therapy that I got at Terrapin Physical Therapy and Tony's guidance.

The entire staff was friendly, knowledgable and very helpful.

I recently suffered an injury that requires physical therapy. I was set up with Terrapin and didn't quite know what to expect. My first appointment was outstanding. I met with Heidi upon arriving and she quickly got me squared away with the paperwork. When I finished, I was quickly seen by my therapist. Tony explained what we would be doing and answered all my questions. He was extremely knowledgeable and built my confidence in the healing process. This injury has come with feeling a little depressed with not being able to live a normal life like before my injury. Tony, my therapist, listened to my concerns and set a plan to help me "get back on my feet."

I mentioned that I would like to come back for a second appointment the following day. They didn't have any times available, so Tony agreed to come in at 7:40am to see me. This was not his usual work time but he went out of his way to accommodate me. I was super impressed with his willingness to help me out. I really want to heal and conveyed this to Tony a few times. I am a motivated customer and he was willing to go overboard to help me achieve my goals.

The pool therapy is unique in California. I understand that there are only 5 locations that have pool based therapy in CA and Terrapin is one of those locations. I enjoyed my pool therapy and responded well to the process.

I am excited about my future sessions with Terrapin and getting back to my normal daily life without this injury!<//text>

<review>Brian started me with a few modified exercises, and light cardio, along with massage to get me started. I have improved with each session. To the point, my Primary Physician, my Husband, even my Neighbors have said "wow" what a difference in the way you are walking! Two people told me that they see the difference in my smile. My pain levels are down, my flexibility is up, and Brian keeps increasing my treatment. It really helps that I continue to work between appointments. Terrapin PT has taught me a lot and how to keep it going. They work with you and not force you beyond your ability.  All the staff are very helpful and kind.</review>< Name>

My right hip and back gave me terrible pain.  My therapist, Tri, and Steve provided me with pool therapy, exercises and deep tissue massage that helped put me on the path to recovery in just a few weeks.

Lisa will be so happy that you and your husband recovered so well with her care and your dedication to get better!'}< /response><Review>Where to begin?  My husband was involved in a motorcycle accident  due to some idiot running a stop sign, which resulted in a bad wrist break.

After having successful surgery with Dr. James Lin with Monterey Spine & Joint, Dr. Lin referred him to Certified Hand Therapist Lisa Livian with Terrapin Physical Therapy, also at Ryan Ranch.  Lisa had a great relationship with Dr. Lin and could email or call him directly if anything came up, which was great and showed a team approach in my husband's healing.  Lisa would tell him how he was progressing and Dr. Lin would confirm it.

Lisa was so AWESOME and explained every step of therapy and the function of each exercise and would address any questions or concerns my husband had.  She showed me how to massage the scar tissue in my husband's hand between PT sessions and I was grateful for being welcomed into the sessions to be a part of his healing process, versus asked to take a seat in the waiting room.

She and the staff were great, always smiling and warm and tolerant of our sense of humor.

Fast forward 6 months and am grateful to say my husband is healed.  Choosing Dr. Lin and working with Lisa Livian were the BEST decisions we could have made throughout my husband's road to recovery.

Lisa, you were so essential to B's healing and we are thankful beyond words for everything you did for us.  We may have started as patients but left as friends.

Great  Physical Therapy Treatment and Staff, worked with Nate and Tony primarily after a Car accident in March 2017.

They were welcoming, patient, and understanding of the stress that my body was going through as well as understanding the emotional and mental stress related to therapy and my accident. Lord forgive me if I need Physical Therapy again, I will only go back to Ripple (Terrapin's 2nd location) for care!< /review>

The environment was friendly and calm. I was with a knowledgeable therapist for the great majority of my time at my appointments. When I first went in, I was in pain and couldn't walk very well; I was unable to pinpoint what was causing this problem, and I was hoping that whatever the problem was, that it could be fixed without surgery and that I could once again be active and mobile.  Well, I am once again hiking and back at Zumba.  Thank-you Jennifer and Katie, and thank -you Terrapin Physical Therapy!!!!!</Text>

Tony and his team are amazing. It's like an episode of "Cheers," everyone knows your name. They are very accommodating and friendly.  My experience at Terrapin has been nothing short of spectacular.<//Review>

<Review>Heidi is Terrible owner who takes billing issues personally at the detriment of patient care. The therapist staff Jennifer and crew are great. The office could use a new office manager besides the owner for it to function better. Customers are last administratively. Find another therapist office.<//Review>< Response>
{'time': 1416338850399, 'text': "Dear Erik,\n\nI apologize for taking so long to respond to this review.  I recently became aware of this review and learned about your frustration during the initial authorization process that your insurance required to pay for Terrapin's services.  I understand it can be frustrating to navigate through insurance steps and please know that we really do care about your happiness and only want to take necessary steps to avoid having you become responsible for a bill that you thought insurance would pick up.  We have invested heavily into our business administrative department and are now well staffed to help you gain authorization more efficiently.\n\nI am happy that you were happy with Jennifer and our treating staff and that you chose to use our services after writing this review.  I hope that Terrapin helped you with your physical therapy needs.\n\nTony Pazzaglia, Doctor of Physical Therapy, CEO of Terrapin Physical Therapy, Inc."}< /Response>

The best thing about injuring my ankle was coming to Terrapin. Everyone is so nice and professional and the treadmill in the pool is amazing. Highly recommended.< /text>

<Gmap_id>0x808de54f6b52c10d:0x1fb742e8227dcbe7</Gmap_id><Text>I love this physical therapy office.  The staff is expert in their treatments and business practices.  I went here to rehab my right hip after replacement surgery.  I responded so much better than I have after other surgery rehabs because I used their pool.  They worked with me to find a safe and quick way to enter the building because my walking is compromised right now.  I finished this therapy about 1 month ago and now I need to exercise my left hip which needs a replacement also but surgery can't be done until July.  With pool therapy I can keep the muscles as strong as possible which will make recovery faster and hopefully keep me out of a nursing home afterwards.  I can wait to get started this time because I know it will make me stronger and reduce the pain I am currently having.<//Text>< Rating>

<Review>Terrapin Physical Therapy is an amazing place to be. Not only do they heal your body, but they heal the mind. Heidi, the office manager, does great at her job. She is very friendly and compassionate.Tony, the owner of Terrapin, is an extremely intelligent man. He has nothing but a warm heart.  All of the therapists are skilled, compassionate, honest and empathetic towards patients and staff.

I have worked at Terrapin for about 8 months as an aide. They treat all staff, including myself, like we are a team. I have never had a bad day at Terrapin. Come see what Terrapin has to offer!

While Tony was my main therapist, I also had weekly aqua therapy sessions with Steve, and also benefitted from other sessions with Paul and Jennefer and Katie. I had been suffering from a poor recovery from a total knee replacement, and frankly was despondent about ever recovering fully when I was referred to Terrapin by a physiatrist. I COULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED BETTER PHYSICAL THERAPY, and can hardly express my gratitude to the Terrapin team for the help, and the hope, which they gave me. They are knowledgeable, extremely courteous and respectful, and highly motivated to help people recover!</Review>

Over the 10 years since we began our practice in Monterey, we have always accepted new patients and continue to serve new patients everyday, six days a week.  While we aren't perfect, we work hard to make sure everyone has a 5-star experience with us.  I am looking into this immediately and addressing this issue with my staff.  Again, my apologies and thank you for bringing this issue to my attention.  I wish the very best to you."}<//resp>

Well it's definitely convenient to be able to buy a pair of vans locally I like the set up the clothes racks are always full making it easy to find your size customer service is great the Inland Center Mall Vans store get's two thumbs up from me and recommend to come down and see yourself

oH yeah hey right next door is wetzel pretzel man you gotta try the pretzel pepperoni pizza it's super bomb with a twist  Good! trust me

those with a sweet tooth try that churro pretzel with the Carmel dipping sauce mmm gets me all twisted up just thinking about it 😉</text>

<text>Never had an issue up until I had to do an exchange on a gift. Unprofessional to have a client wait 2 hrs just to be told that the vans can't be exchanged because they were probably not purchased originally at a vans store. Ridiculous.< /text>< response>

We were trying to return some things and she gave us attitude like as if we were trying to rip her off or something.

Had the guys at express put a system in my 2013 ram truck. They didn’t try and sell me extra stuff I didn’t need. And the work they did do was excellent,  everything looks and sounds great!
Thanks!!</review>

Amazing work! I absolutely love these guys they are very knowledgeable and always help me out by giving me the best bang for my buck. Just had some window tinting done on my car and it came out great. This is the second car I have had tinited here and it is absolutely amazing every time! Coming back soon for some new stereo and alarm work.<//Text>

The BEST audio✔, alarm✔, remote start✔ location anywhere! Over the years, when one of my vehicles has needed an upgrade, I have always been able to rely on the great prices, superb customer service, and knowledgeable staff to point me in the right direction for my needs. I recently purchased a new car and was worried about its safety. I decided to put an alarm on it. I knew immediately that I could count on the wonderful people at Express Car Audio 😃 to help me. Elias helped me choose what was best for what I wanted. He made me a deal to also add a remote start for not too much more. I couldn't imagine being happier with my decision to go to Express Car Audio!  Tina Turner's "Simply the Best" is what I am reminded of when I'm there. Now, I press a button and my car starts. is cool by the time I get in, which is freaking sweet, considering how hot it's been! Also, I'm looking forward to not having to waste time warming up my car 🚘this winter! 😁😁😁< /text>

These guys have never tried and pressure me into buying anything I didn't need. I even brought in some of my own equipment for them to install and they were more than willing to work with me on the price. I definitely got the most bang for my buck. After being ripped off and lied to by other audio places this is the only one I would recommend to my friends, enough said.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80900cfbf03592d7:0x4a582a4e6bc2b070<//GmapID></record>

Took my car in 2 months ago the owner and staff there took really good care of me. I gave them a 5 star rating because they are very knowledgeable with all car audio and security needs. I recommend Express car audio for all your mobile sound/security electronics.<//Review>

I absolutely love the service I get at Express Car Audio.
I walk into the store with just an idea of what I want and the techs
there bring it to light. I have been a customer at the Hammer Lane store
for a long, long time (long time) and the service has always been great. One thing that really impresses me is.....Express Car Audio stands by their work. Without hesitation, I refer this store to friends, family and anybody else who want a system installed.

Professional, great prices, excellent service and nice people make a
great place to take you vehicle (s) for what you want in audio & video.
If you want to accessorize.....these guys are wise.....and Good!
Don't take my word for it......Check it out!

And thank you Express Car Audio for your great service and "Great Deals"!!!< /text>< pics>

Love this place!! I recently brought my Civic in for a new stereo and speakers and was greeted by such a nice young man. Sean was so knowledgeable on what would look and sound best in my car. They were able to get it done same day too! I will for sure be bringing more cars here in the future!<//text>

<Text>When I came to this store at first they had great big reputable brands, like Jsvc, hertz, Phoenix gold, pioneer and much more! When I came here they made it easy for me to find what I was looking for. I was looking for a low bass and high vocals. He should me hertz and he installed it within a couple hours. It was easy and simple to get a great speaker system in my car<//Text>< pics>

These guys are the best! I've had several vehicles done with them, from audio systems to alarms. All work very nicely and in case they don't they take care of it. Overall I'm very satisfied with customer service and their technical abilities.</text>

Wow, it was a treat to have them install my car stereo,  and they were very fast, price was fair, and it looks so nice in my car. They are very professional and carving towards their customers.  They know what their doing,  and I'm glad I got my car music needs taken care of by them.

Updated: 9/23/20
I had Express car audio add a dashboard camera front and back, and add a small subwoofer to my SUV. They listen to my wants and delivered by doing another amazing job.  These guys know what they are doing.  I wanted a factory,  clean, and matching kinda job with these aftermarket items. They just far exceed my expectations and do a fantastic job every time. They all know what to suggest,  if you dont know what you want,  or have a set budget.  They deliver on a clean and neat job and its a white glove installation every time.  I just enjoy coming here. Amazing prices,  and careing staff.  Thats why I don't go anywhere else.</Review>

<Review>I have been going to Express Car Audio now going on 7 years. I have never been disappointed in the products or the quality of work they do. Elias and his team are very knowledgeable on the products and will tell you what will or will not work, or what will be the best bang for your buck. They are very honest and good people there, they get all of my recommendations for people asking where to go. They definitely have a life long customer with me.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>My speakers blew-out a couple miles into a long journey. Express Car Audio on Hammer Lane in Stockton took care of me! The staff were polite and professional. They carefully assessed my audio situation and completed the work in an hour and a half at a reasonable price. I could not be happier with the service.

I have done business with these guys regularly for a little over a year now and have nothing negative to say about them. Their service is always excellent, everybody is very friendly. The installs were seamless and everything went back in such a way that you would never know anything had been taken apart. Staff is very knowledgable as well and even went as far as showing me the stereo in their personal car to give me some ideas for my own. I have and would recommend doing business with these guys.< /review>

<Date>1450826970448< /Date><rating>5< /rating><Text>This was a really nice place to go! I bought a stereo, installation kit, and harness from walmart and was calling around for prices. I called this store and they told me it would be 50 bucks to install it into my 2001 ford ranger. I went next door to starbucks and waited 3 hours before walking back to check up on my truck. I then found out it had been done and ready to go. By my mistake I had written down the wrong number to contact which is why I didn't know sooner lol pretty funny moment actually...the installation kit I purchased from walmart wasn't the right one. So they used one of their kits that is usually 30 dollars for my truck...to my amazement they price matched the one I purchased through walmart with theirs....I was so happy with their customer service! I walked out of their very pleased and very happy! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! I didn't feel ripped off and now I can return the one I bought at walmart to get reimbursed for the cost that they charged me! Definitely go here if you want a stereo installation! They don't rip you off and they are very friendly. If I knew they were this awesome I woulda just purchased the stereo from them! Thanks again!!<//Text>< pics>

<text>I got here because I needed to make my sound system to sound better, I had an old radio and not clue of was new out there. I talk to the guys and agreed to take their advice.
I bought a AVIC-8100NEX radio with navigation and bluetooth, an amp for my speakers Phoenix Gold  SX800.4, also some speaker components ESK165.3  and ECX165.3 all these speaker are HERTZ thats an Italian made speaker, I never heard speakers to sound that clean in my life.
After all I'm very happy with the work they've done.
I will be back for a Bass system.

Update on August 30th 2018

I came back to get my bass System installation.
Great people, nice greeting, great laborship and reasonable pricing .
Since I like some bass I got their Phoenix Gold Elite series subwoofer on a custom box.
I sounds just the way I love it .
Also got a deal on my window tint .
I recomend this place to anyone with audio needs.
Talk to them. They're easy to talk to.
Great place .</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Who do I report the California Board of Nursing to? I want to file a complaint against them. I paid them for my application. It’s been MONTHS and they have not approved it. I sent them every single thing they asked for. They’ve stolen my money and have not rendered the service they said they would provide. I’m holding off on contacting an attorney for now. I need to know to who they report so I can file a complaint against them.

I keep calling. And every time the machine tells me they’re busy and hangs up!! I am so fed up!<//text>

< Review>
I originally applied by endorsement in 3/2020, but couldn't find anywhere to get my fingerprints completed due to Covid. I was finally able to get someone on the phone to see what else was needed in 1/27/2021 and was told to send in my fingerprints and transcripts for my prerequisites (they'd already had my main nursing school transcripts but needed a few course transcripts for additional classes). The person I talked to said I'd already paid, and they received everything else but transcripts and fingerprints. They had everything by 2/3/2021, I know this because I did tracking with USPS. I was told in 3/2021 via email that my fingerprints were processing and to give it 2 more weeks. The person who replied didn't know about the transcripts, but parchment showed them as delivered on 1/28/21. They never opened them til this day 5/10/21. At that time on 3/28/21,  my status was pending the two items above. Long story shortened as much as possible, I just checked today 5/10, and my status says expired. I'm filing a formal complaint against this board. All of these reviews makes an even stronger argument. They basically stole my $400 app fee and took months just to quietly change it to expired after making me send everything in. It's also not my fault COVID shut the world down and I couldn't get fingerprinted. I hold 4 other licenses and I have NEVER had this to happen. Most were approved and active within 1-2 weeks.<//Review>

<text>My experience with California Board of Registered Nurses was excellently great. Their service is satisfactory to me. I applied for Endorsement from Texas to California, the process was smooth which simply follow the instructions on the application. The normal processing times are 10 - 12 weeks but my application process was concluded at 8 weeks. I got my license 2 days ago. Thank you BRN</text>< UserId.>

Calling the office is next to impossible. I got my PMHNP and furnishing licenses enough time for me to renew it again. Trying to call them with no success, leaving a call back number as it was instructed but no call back received from them. Poor services and charging so much. Other state can release their licenses in just 2 weeks. I can only give 1 star but they don't deserve it even 1/2 of it. I hope they can do something in this.< /Review>

I’ve been putting off this review bc every person I’ve spoken with on the phone has been pleasant. However. Getting someone on the phone is IMPOSSIBLE. You have to call them right when they open, and even then, it takes hours for a call back. They are taking FOREVER to endorse my license. It’s been months, saying they are “missing transcripts” when I sent them in the same time I sent everything else. Also received an email that the transcripts were retrieved by the recipient. So someone isn’t doing their job correctly. I’m getting the run around from everyone who works here and I’m FED TF UP. How can you be so unorganized it’s embarrassing for your company. Get it together.<//Text>

From the management to the staff they are worst of the worst. These people doesn't have a shame. They don't pickup the call. They don't respond to your email. It's been 3 months and I am still waiting to clear my deficiencies documents. However, they are quick to take huge application fee of $750. If you are taking this much money for application, at least work on the application and hire more staff to get the things done in time.< /text>

<Text>Terribly run organization.  The representative that I finally got to talk to on the phone was horrible and did not even know what website I had to go to to complete my application.  I've heard that California is a poorly run state and the BON would fit as a good example of this.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Probably the most frustrating and inefficient organization that I've had to work with. I have the unfortunate pleasure of having my original license from California, which means that I need verification from them to get other nursing licenses. The CBRN, intent on providing the most irritating service, refuses to use the NURSYS system and charge three times the price, while taking weeks to complete the process. They give no regard for peoples' livelihoods and leave people in limbo, not knowing how long it will take to have them send verification and probably causing people to give up job offers due to delayed licensing secondary to the CRBN's sloth-like action.</Review>< Pics>

If I could rate this BON 0/5 stars I would. I can’t even believe how unorganized and flat out TERRIBLE this board is. I applied for licensure by endorsement. Cost me $400. Okay fine. I send my transcripts and fingerprints and am prepared to wait until my license has been approved. Wrong. They send me a deficiency notice about my transcripts and how they need essentially everything from nursing school. How? I sent it? And it was confirmed via email that they received it? They also sent me a deficiency about my fingerprints. How? They were sent? This BON has absolutely no idea what they are doing and no idea how to run a business. I’ve called and called and called. No one calls back. Or they call back at 4:50pm and hang up. How in the world am I waiting 9 hours for a call back? You cannot be that busy. This is a disgrace for a company and it’s honestly disgusting. Poor excuse for a BON. I hold licenses in 5 other states and this one is the WORST EXPERIENCE by a landslide. Figure it out.<//Review>

<text>Oh no, came here to check reviews, same experience I am getting.  Nobody answers the phone, then the phone cue is full so can’t leave call back number.  I remember about a month ago the wait list for call back was over 60 people, I submitted my name and then finally I got a call back from an automated machine, but since it was 5p and the office closed, the machine called me back just to hang up on me, and kick me out of the cue lol.  They seem overly busy and run down, how do we find these people and check on if they are okay?  They might need a morale boost... Cali BON, we need you!!

UPDATE: finally got my License by endorsement! Called one day and miraculously got through.. the lady checked my file but in the meantime we got disconnected, then I couldn’t connect again.  But later saw she submitted my application and it went through and my status was current on the Cali Board of Nursing website.   Took 7 months for license by endorsement... for anyone still waiting don’t give up! Just keep trying to call.. it will come..< /text><resp>None< /resp>< Pictures>

I called repeatedly to address this, but nothing. I waited on hold for over an hour just to get hung up on multiple times. I decided to send my transcript once more, and still have seen no change in my status on their website. How can a government agency be so horrible? It’s ridiculous.</text></record></dataset><record>
< text>
It’s been well over 5 months since they’ve looked at my application again to see that I’ve sent all the missing documents they said I needed. When you call and it’s busy, they have the option to leave your number for them to call back “by the end of the day”. I’ve done that in the past but now that I recently called, it says the call back queue is full! What am I suppose to do now!????</text>

I have been calling for days, walk around with headphones on, on hold never to pick up<//Review>

I applied in May, for my endorsement license. It is almost December. I hail from Florida. Minimal hopping around so the background check should’ve come back fairly quick. They lost my first set of fingerprints and they took 6 months to update the system once received. When I called they said it wasn't there, called back and said something with the background check. Following up is hopeless because they just sent an automated response, and if you email again, asking to speak to someone, they just send it again. Every time you call you wait 2 hours. If you get transferred, you go to a voice-mail that never calls back.< /Text>

My experience was pretty good all things considered. I went there and immediately had my issue addressed. I had to wait 30min but that was my choice to ensure everything was done before I left. I however was disappointed that they had all my information just sitting in there system for months without adding it in so I could have gotten my license 😒 however they resolved it right away so I'm atleast happy about that.< /review>

I truly cannot say enough bad things about this BON. They take MONTHS longer than what their “processing times” say on the website. And good luck trying to reach anyone if you have an issue, I have sent emails and letters, both go unanswered, and I have called them and spent hours (yes, hours) on hold only for the line to disconnect. It’s been 6 months of this. Terrible!</Text>

This is the worst government agency I have ever encountered, period.  I have been waiting more than 5 months for my license by endorsement.  I have an active license in another state.  I have provided all documents.  They have been "reviewing my transcripts" for more than two months.  Many phone calls and many hours sitting on hold to get no purposeful action.  What a disgrace to the nursing practice.< /text>

<Text>The absolute worst BoN. 1 star would be generous. Was on hold for almost 2 hours (and that’s short) and as soon as the guy picked up it was staticky and he immediately hung up. Beyond frustrated. Something needs to be done about this facility. Its efficiency is terrible and needs to be addressed. I need a license in my state and I cannot get it until they send a verification, which will take only God knows how long. I am very disappointed in this place and cannot even express how frustrated I am. Just look at the other reviews. I’m not the only one. This continues to happen over and over and over again with nurses around the country and it has got to be addressed.<//Text>< Pics>

I DON'T KNOW WHY AUTHORITIES DONT  TAKE ANY ACTION EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE MANY MANY BAD REVIEWS ABOUT CA BOARD ??? MANY NURSES ARE SUFFERING AND IN PAIN WHEN THEY TRY TO GET CALIFORNIA RN LICENSE OR TRY TO DO RN ENDORSEMENT. ITS A SHAME FOR THE ENTIRE NATION WHEN YOU GUYS BEHAVE SO BADLY. MANY NURSES ARE NEEDED FOR HOSPITALS DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND YOU GUYS SEEMS DON'T EVEN CARE FOR FRONT LINE WORKERS. VERY VERY BAD ATTITUDE !!!!</Text>

< Review>
can we put les then 1 star!! I have been trying to get a hold of them for weeks.  I have waited on hold for 1 hr and 33 minutes (took a screen shot even) then someone picked and hung up!! This is not okay,  we cannot do our jobs without our license.  How can we change this?</Review>

By far the worst experience I have ever had with a government agency. I have waited 14 weeks to get an RN license by endorsement and paid $500, only to find out that it will now be another 4+ weeks. You can’t get through on the phone, call hold times are 2+ hours and the operator named Michelle is very rude and unhelpful. People’s jobs (and ability to put food on the table) are depending on their license to work and this agency doesn’t seem to care. There is no reason that someone who already has an RN license should be waiting months to start working for the government to verify their license!!!!</text>

At this point I think I’ll have better luck driving to Sacramento and yelling at them through a window to update my address! 6 days of waiting on hold for 3+ hours and I’ve almost always been disconnected.

The one time they picked up I was hung up on before my question/address update was answered, so now I’m left calling back again and again.</text>

Would give zero stars if I could. Each employee you talk to tells you something different or that the previous employee directed you to do the wrong thing. Usually on hold for about 45 minutes before reaching someone and feel you have to call every other day to make any progress with your application. One female employee kept cutting me off in the middle of my questions and then hung up on me. Incredibly frustrating process. Avoid if you can.<//text>

That one five star review is clearly a shill! This place is a joke. They are uncaring, unprofessional, and absolutely unapologetic about their rude, robotic and sociopathic behavior towards, and treatment of nurses. This is by far the worst government agency I've ever encountered. They don't care one iota about helping RNs in ANY capacity. Not only that but they are incredibly disrespectful and treat RNs with an air of accusation and condescension all the time regardless of the issue. They are always on the defense and do not allow people to talk without cutting them off before even given a chance to fully explain their reason for being there. Absolutely horrible place and people that should be held accountable for their unwavering mean and dismissive behavior towards nurses. Disgusting!<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>1. they do not listen
2. they answer with scripted statements
3. the board is unreasonable for what they are requesting during a pandemic
4. they haven't joined a nursing compact which would benefit patient/families if nurses were able to move across states freely in disasters like wildfires, earthquakes, pandemics, etc.
5. I can practice in many states in the USA. Not California because they won't extend deadlines in a pandemic although they have $400.00 of mine
6. Patients and families are clearly not their top priority or they would want experienced nurses in the state. I'm not sure they know what their mission is...
7. I'd give below a zero if that were allowed. The board lacks leadership.<//Text>< pictures>

Still waiting after 10 weeks for my endorsement. They claimed they mailed it but it was “lost in the mail”... instead of resending another one, I waited on hold nearly 2 hours to be told I have to wait a full month before they will resend a new one. It’s “policy”.

Well, the month came up and, shocker, it still didn’t show up. So I spent 3 separate phone calls all over an hour for it to ring and DISCONNECT me! Every time! I spent 4 hours total of my day waiting to speak to someone only to be hung up on.

Idk what it takes for changes to happen here but it’s  necessary. This place is a complete joke!!< /review>< Pics>

Called at the last hour of the working day expecting that my chances of actually getting through to an actual person were slim to non...but only ended up waiting for about 40mins and the person who answered was kind and attentive when I explained my issue. They not only gave me the answer to my question, but also went a step further to contact the individual I needed to get ahold of personally to aid in expediting the whole process. Just wanted to give hope that not all experiences calling here are setting you up for failure and frustration! Good luck and good vibes to y’all!!<//text>

this is the absolute worst licensing agency I have ever worked with. They take forever, their website is outdated, and they charge so much more than other states for anything and everything involving a nursing license. This is only a small list of all the other things wrong with them. This organization should be ashamed of themselves.</text>

I would give the California BRN no stars if that was an option! California is in dire need for nurses and yet the California BRN makes it nearly impossible to get a new graduate a date for their BRN test. They have to jump through hoops and ridiculous requests in order to even speak to someone and then, no action. Typical government run around and red tape. We have an unprecedented health care crisis and need nurses, yet the BRN does nothing to improve efficiency. Shame on you!!!</Review>

This is the worst board of nursing l have ever encountered. The waiting time in the phone calls are usually at least 30mins and oftentimes they hang up the calls. It feels as if only 2 people work for this agency because everything is processed so slow. Plus some of the customer service people are rude and don’t know how to do their jobs.<//Text>

I have traveled to several states (including Texas, which is also a large state that employs many nurses) and I have never had the trouble that I have had with simply getting a verification that I had a license in this state. I pay $100, which is happily taken from my bank account long before the application is even processed! If everything takes SO LONG to process, then why not change your system to where everything is done online?! It just shows that the state of California does not care about their residents or nurses, only what profit that they get. Just terrible.<//Review>

<Text>Horrible online renewal process.  I spent several hours online(because of course there is no access to anyone by phone) trying to renew my RN, NP an furnishing number.  When a screen was completed it kept coming up again.  After I thought I had finally finished and paid the fees I just checked- only the RN went through .  The breeze rep said the furnishing number was paid but not sure why it did not go through.  No record of payment for NP.  Despite paying a total of about $500.00 the "service" was poor with rude and unhelpful reps and the website very difficult.  Perhaps they should privatize so that performance matters. The CA BRN is a mess!<//Text>< Pictures>

Its the worst experience ever,  rude and bad attitude,  you need to stay on hold for one hour and finally when somebody answer you won't get helpful information, you will be lucky if they don't hang up on you, needless to mention that there is a high percentage to submit your documents more than once because they lost yours.</text>

Freaking awesome! Definitely coming back! Fresh sandwiches,  friendly and fast service. Great prices for what you get. $8.99 combo with a dessert. Great dinner meals too. Jars of goodies like chutney and flavored condiments. You gotta try this place. I've driven by forever and everyone knows they have awesome ham and turkey but now this is my go to sandwich spot. 😁👍<//Text>

< review>
A Honeybaked Ham is both a primary food dish and a tradition for both if the 2 major year-end holidays -  ie, Thanksgiving & Christmas.  The Pasadena store is usually **JAM-PACKED** with patrons waiting in line to pick up their orders in the 2 or 3 days before the holiday.  However, the store managers _ employees do a great job with efficient use of multiple check-out lines to keep the clients moving through with their purchases.</review>

I was at Honeybaked in Pasadena, California on Sierra Madre Blvd. There was available parking in the store lot. The associate was friendly, personable and very helpful. There was not a long wait for service. The line had been out the door and around the corner for Thanksgiving, but today was a breeze! This was great when considering it is the Christmas season! People were coming and going. Honeybaked did it again!<//Text>

<review>The ham was delicious, but I waited an hour and a half in line to pick it up. The line stretched around the corner and down the sidewalk. It looked like a giant J. Luckily, there was a woman passing around samples to the line, which was nice. Cheesecake I believe. I sort of understand the line, since it was the day before Thanksgiving. Though I'd say it was worth it, an hour and a half seems a bit long to me.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<user_name>Thomas Malooly</user_name><review>This has been our go-to place for holiday ham and turkey for years. We have never been disappointed. Although parking in the small lot and the always required line of people, still totally worth it. Suggest you preorder your choices to the store. Then two of you go to pick it up. One who is dropped off while the other circles the block. This makes for a much more pleasant experience. Enjoy.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2db50a2cc259b:0x5460709c78e29635< /Gmap_id>< Pictures>

I visited the store in Pasadena on Sierra  Madre to reserve a Ham an Turkey breast for Easter Sunday. The young gentlemen at the counter assured me if I purchased it 5 days before I was actually going to be serving it, it would be fine. His exact words  I guarentee you. The ham had absolutely no glaze and the Turkey breast tasted old.ii spent 80+ dollars an our dinner wasn't at all what we had hoped. I won't be making any more purchases at honey baked ham again</review><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Love this store. I grab a Thanksgiving ham and bring it to extended family as a tradition. I make sure to get the online coupon and save the 7-10 dollars. I just recently took advantage of a SpotOn deal. Honeybaked smoked turkey. I was blown away at the size of the breast. He came with two free sides. Wow. It was Thanksgiving in June.</Review><UserId.>106746909711227215412< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

I ordered ham for myself as well as my two daughters, one in Martinez, ca and the other in Dublin, Ohio. All 3 orders arrived as promised and were a huge hit with all. Oh, I also sent a ham and all the fixings to a
Friend in Sun City, Arizona, and they RAVED about the whole meal. Will definitely order again. Caroline Anderson<//Review>

If you buy and pick up the day before Thanksgiving, give yourself about 40-60 minutes to wait in line.  Otherwise, pick it up 2 days before Thanksgiving because the ham will definitely be just as tasty (and smokey).  They also have turkey and a few other side items for sale, including Kings Hawaiian buns.  The parking lot isn't that big when it's crowded so you're better off parking across the street or in the nearby neighborhood and walking over.</review>

I was delighted to see how short the lines were here compared to the Glendale location, and also how fast the lines moved here. I was able to get ham and Hawaiian rolls in under 20 minutes. I remember standing in line at the Glendale location one thanksgiving for more than 2 hours. That was a nightmare!< /review>

<Review>By word of mouth from others, I went to pick up a 8 pounder today.  The store is clean and displays are well stacked and organized.  I like it.  But... the reception from the store clerk although courteous but kind of cold.  That may turn me away from future visit.  I tried the game and it is perfectly goooood.!</Review>< Rating>

I would have used a -5  I had the choice for -5 stars if I had the choice!. A week before Thanksgiving I order a 15 pound $109.00 ham to be delivered the day before the holiday. I waited until around 3 pm on that very day to find put when was I supposed to expect the delivery  only to be told there was a mistake and the ham was NOT going to arrive, I was sent to pick it up at the local store and instructed to speak directly with the store manager . I went to the store to find a line of people that wrap around the corner, 1 1/2 blocks,  tried to go to the front and was not allowed by other customers and they were right  who am I to cut throughout the line. So i had to get in line and wait for almost 2 hours to finally get my ham. I CHOOSE TO BUY ONLINE SO AS NOT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS, YOUR ONLINE SERVICE IS WORTHLESS!!!.< /review>

<text>1st time there today after my wonderful husband brought me a sandwich the other day, I loved it it was their Hawaiian with ham. He had the Tri tip sandwich with horseradish. I had to try it. I only have a half of an hour for lunch so I called in the order and got some of my coworkers to try it also. I asked for mine to be put on top so I could eat it there. When I got there everything was labled easy to pay, great customer service loved the seating and really loves the sandwich. Got back to work on time working only 5 minutes away. My coworkers were very pleased as well. We are now making this out Friday lunch spot. Cant wait to try all the sandwiches for 6.99 cant beat it. Thanks!< /text></record>

I can't believe I have passed Honey Baked Ham Company  5 days a week for a full year and never knew what it had to offer (Mind Blown)

As thanksgiving approaches I was talking to a co worker about my thoughts in purchasing a ham to only be told that they are open year round and also have lunch/dinner special.

On a lunch break I finally decided to stop by and see what they offer, it was about 12:30pm and as I waked in there was only one person in line so the wait time was very little which I was happy about only because I knew I had lots of questions. The staff was amazing and very helpful, they answered all my questions and suggested some of the popular items.

I ordered the Tavern Club with the Hawaiian Bread which cost $6.99 (What a Deal) and for $2.00 more you can make it a combo with a choice of a fresh made side and a side salad but right now they also have the $2.00 combo with a fresh made side and a slice of cake. This combo is a great buy and let me tell you it was sooo delicious. The ham is cooked to perfection and cut thick to make every bite worth your wild.

I am happy to announce that I work minutes away and will definitely be back during my lunch breaks to try everything on the menu.

FYI they have a good amount of parking out front and lots of staff to keep the flow moving inside.<//text>

<Review>HoneyBaked Ham Co. located in Pasadena has always been a pleasant shopping trip.  Their seasonal workers are attentive, pleasant and move pretty fast.  I love their samplings and I am grateful to live pretty close to Honeybaked Ham Co., not a far drive for me.  I have had their famous Honey Baked Ham, their smoked Turkey and those bbq ribs.  The sides aren't bad also.  Love their cheesy potatoes and cranberry sauce.  Umm, Umm good!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Everything is good but they need to address "No Ham Salad" mix until after holidays. It's not a seasonal item. Been there 3xs & was told after New Years.< /text>< Date>

We came in for a quick bit to eat and enjoy the company of each other. We were welcomed into the store by friendly staff. Our plan was to enjoy lunch there and found out that they just had 2 new bistro tables brought in. We were able to sample the sides & meat prior to our lunch purchase. Overall great experience and something we will enjoy coming back to.< /review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>We have been shopping at honeybaked since i was a kid. We moved to Pasadena and tried the near by location. What a letdown. First off they pulled the old "we don't have any smaller hams" up sell. Went from $30 to $80. Then they said they were too busy to show us the ham before we bought it which every other honeybaked does without asking. We were the only people there !!! We got it home and it had almost no crust on it. PATHETIC. We will never shop at this location again.< /text>< user>

Small little storefront. I always visit after the holidays for leftover specials. Then I stick up and use the ham or ham bones for winter soups.< /review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The best place in ham and turkey the most I have not tasted good this is a place for food for parties only a problem that if you put your order aside you have to pay because if you do not pay it they do not respect it you have to train with the whole long line of people waiting until the last day jjjj

El mejor lugar en  jamón y pavo lo de más no lo e probado bueno  este es un lugar para comida para fiestas solo all un problema que si apartas tu pedido lo tienes que pagar por que sino lo pagas no te lo respetan  te tienes que formar  con toda la larga fila de personas de las que esperan has ta el el último día  jjjj</Review>< pics>

<text>A joke seriously a joke . I went in with my kid's and had the worst service ever. This place needs management and to more clean eith their operations and letting people in the store . Also they are almost put of every game possible so I don't understand why they have stuff on the shelf if it isn't available?  Seems counterproductive to have it listed as available if ultimately you have to order it ! Hope they figure it out because its very unpleasant going in there!< /text>< Date>

Staff are cool they're very helpful with me. Made sure I understood everything going on and walked me through it. Cool people and lots to pick and choose merch wise. And of course there's a lot of games to choose from.</Text>

I bought a used game and when I got home it didn't work (scratched). I took it back a week later and they gave me a newer one that works great! Sometimes they appear to be a little understaffed so getting through the line can be a bit slow. Overall a good experience.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Friday almost 3pm. Three tellers in the counter. One is doing her own thing, and other one walking around do very little things. Only one person is serving customer. There is only 7 ppl when I came. It’s half hour pass, there is still three ahead of me. Don’t know why BOA still keep this branch.<//Review></record>

<review>Gets busy here especially during peak hours. I'd recommend to make an appointment instead of walk in if you need to do wires or talk to a specialist. The parking situation isn't bad as I've been able to park either next to the bank or a short walk across the next parking lot to the restaurant.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

It wouldn’t be as bad to be turned away if they weren’t rude, unhelpful, and act like they don’t even want to be there. At least act like you want to help the customer and don’t roll your eyes at us. We’ve been customers for 15 years and are looking at going elsewhere.
Do not use this location if you have any other option.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
Terrible customer service. Lady in the front clearly hates her life. Impolite to all the customers in front of me and brushes me off. People, seriously leave BoA and go to a Credit Union. I've had a BoA account for ten years and there's no benefit.</Review>

<Text>Wish I could give them 0 stars. The lines are horrible, the staff (outside of tellers) give you wrong information. They are rude and not informative at all. I will be closing all 4 accounts I have with them. They are losing a client of 27 years.

PLEASE! PLEASE don't bank with this branch or BoA in general. They were once a good place to bank with.</Text>< pics>

Wow six people behind the glass and only two helping customers.  14 people in line and its fun chat chat time behind the glass. The only time this bank is quick about anything is getting you out the door when they are about to close. P.s. they have two concierges......who are just talking to each other, not to customers.</text>

As if this place didn’t already have a problem servicing their customers, now they have changed the hours for their “merchant window” to 10am!?! They are located in a major business district and can’t service their business customers until 10:00? Unbelievable.</Review>

This place is very bad. Unprofessional staffs and the Manager Horacio is very rude. The line take forever. I will never go here if you want fast service with professional staffs. Customers should be important but to this place their breaks is more important.</review>

< review>
The woman Gaby claims she is the branch manager is very rude when I make a mortgage payment at this branch.  I am glad I don't have a bank account with BOA.  This woman shut the door on a poor person's foot when the guy was exiting the door at 5:58 pm .  She did not even apologized for her rude behavior.  She treats everyone rude, I wonder how did this woman becomes a branch manager?</review>

<text>Been with BofA since 1990, this by far is the worst branch I've ever been in. Simply not managed properly. Always long lines with errogant employees/managers standing in the back smirking at you while you stand behind 12-15 ahead of you. To BofA: perception is everything, so stop laughing and goofing around, at least pretend you're working...its awfully frustrating when you're standing in line for 30+ minutes and we see people goofing around. Needless to say, it's also very unprofessional.</text><username>Manuel Cabrera<//username>< Time>

An order of Jack in the Box tacos consists of two tacos. I ordered 2 orders of tacos. The young man kept questioning if I wanted 2 tacos. I said I wanted 2 orders of tacos. Get my order and there are only 2 tacos. I tell him that I needed another order of tacos. He again questioned if I wanted 2 tacos. I said well isn't one order of tacos 2 tacos? Then 2 orders of tacos would be 4 tacos. He still looked puzzled and said so you want another order of tacos? Yes! I asked for 2 orders and you only gave me one. He replied so you want 2 tacos?? Again I replied if one order is 2 tacos then yes I want 2 tacos. Exactly what I originally ordered the first time. Plus no hot sauce. They added the hot sauce and had to make 2 more tacos. The lady making the tacos looked at me & sang something in Spanish & spoke in Spanish. I don't speak Spanish but by the sound of it she wasn't happy. She mad the young man I ordered from make the tacos. He shoved them in front of me and said here's your tacos I s and I made them myself! Had been driving long and if I didn't have my 90 year old Mom with me I would of walked out. Simple math??<//Review>

It's currently 12:30am, Tuesday and despite the fact that it says 24 hours(as you can see here), the main area is closed. Even when there's no vehicle going through the drive through they chose to pretty much lounge around and doing nothing instead of honoring the supposed "24 hours" shown in their service schedule. Waiting for an hour and a half now and It's safe to assume I'm invisible to the staff.

It sucks since whenever you look for a 24 hour location, this place pops up. Turns out the whole thing is a huge lie< /Text>

Consistently over cooked fries, which are somehow cold by the time I get them. So, basically stale cold french fries like the ones I got last night. Attempting to reheat them turns them into cardboard. I wouldn't normally bother reviewing a fast food restaurant but you replied so here we are. You need better quality control, the employee who finishes the transaction needs to look at the food and ask themselves if the quality is acceptable. I was just going to stop going to your restaurant but since you have bothered to reply to my 2 star review I may give it another chance. If the fries are old and gross, throw them out and make a new batch. I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes, that should be obvious. You're a burger & fries place, your fries need to not be awful when there are plenty of businesses offering the exact same stuff in the immediate area. Do better.< /text>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>I love jack in the box! But this one on Milpas Street in Sta Barbara turned me off. My family opted to take out lunch to prepare for a long trip going home. It was an order of 4 burger meals and 4 extra items. There was a lot of missing items from our order, a lot of angry waiting people and the staff were just giggling about it. I love the camaraderie, but giggling in front of angry, hungry people specially when you're taking long to get their orders right doesn't make the situation better on our side of the counter.

Food is still good, everything was freshly cooked and the loaded fries are the best!</review>< pics>

I go to school near here and whenever I have extra money I go here. only complaint I have and  why this doesn’t get 5 stars is because any meal that has egg in it always have shells still in them and whenever I order tacos, 3/4 of the time they add sauce to the tacos when I specifically ask for none.< /text>

Has been my favorite breakfast spot, the brunch menu is pretty awesome. And of course the only spot for late-night munchies. However if you care about your body your health and specifically your weight. Eating here just once a week will make you fat I ate breakfast here once a week for 4 months as I traveled up and down California and I gained 30 lb it was the only thing I did different.

This is a cautionary tale......</Review>

No. Greasy, and with a ton of mayo. Tiny little puck of meat. And yet, it's a gut bomb. There are far better options nearby.<//Text>

If I could write a -0 review, I would. Asked for an egg and cheese burrito with NO meat and gave me a burrito with bacon. Asked for a Diet Coke and they gave me a coke. Can’t expect anything more with a fast food spot so only thing I will say is... DOUBLE CHECK your order when you receive it!</Text>

Been here many times. Would recommend their breakfast items. And they're served all day. Last time they messed up my order but it was wrong on the receipt so I wasn't charged extra. I still enjoyed everything I did get.< /Review>

Waited for 15 mins for order to be taken before we left. Keep in mind no one was in front of us. Associates did not acknowledge us or let us know they would be with us. The associates were focused on taking and serving  drive thru orders. they had 4 people that ordered inside unhappily waiting for orders. Place was also a mess! I regret not taking pictures<//text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Was buying lunch for myself and a coworker, 2 separate orders. When I explained this at the drive through I was told one order per car. I said fine I'll pull back through again (my car battery was going out). I was told rules are rules and now I needed to come inside to order. I come inside and the place is crawling with homeless people. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Want $15 an hour but can't do 2 separate orders in one car...< /Review>< rate>

<text>Employee at drive-thru really rude and she got annoyed when I changed my drink to another one. She said on the speaker "Humm" like it was too much I asked for... She should appreciate customers because of us she gets a paycheck. This is not the first time I have a bad experience at this Jack in the Box, they need better training at customer service.</text>< Time>

Most Jack in the boxes are a little dirty and depressing, and this one is no exception. Tables dirty with other people's food, and feces on the floor in the bathroom. Disgusting. The one star is for the wild cod, although hope I don't get e.coli from being here</Text>

This place grossed me out!!! The restroom was not working and the toilet water was all the way to  the lobby. I informed the cashier and he showed no interest in doing anything about it.  To top it off the lobby was not busy at all.
I walked away and did not purchase anything.
Never returning here!!</Text>

Exactly what you expect from jack in the box, warm food of questionable quality served fast.</Text>

Like many other Jack in the Box locations, this one also lacks in the consistency of acceptable customer service.  For the price you pay (almost always $10-$15 per meal), you should get what you ordered, portioned correctly, hot and fresh, and without the extra side of attitude.< /text>

Only person waiting.  Stood at the checkout for a couple of minutes while the staff (including a manager) chatted away, not working, and completely ignored me.  Gave up and left before they even acknowledged me.<//Review>
