< Review>
Rolls are good, fish was fresh, service was friendly. They've got a huge variety of rolls, many uniquely their own. Ordered the spider roll and the Iron monkey roll, both were great! Tempura was crunchy and fresh from the fryer. Great little local place for sushi.< /Review>

<Text>BEST SUSHI IN MV! Sushi on the lake used to be our go-to until we found Terra. It’s truly a hidden gem. Absolutely delicious rolls, a ton of variety in the menu, and great service. Always fresh ingredients. We haven’t been able to dine-in yet, but have done take out a few times and they do it right. All sauces for take out come on the side, and everything is packaged to keep your food presentable and tasting great. We love Terra Sushi!<//Text>< pics>

Decided to try this place out on Friday night and it was packed! The vibe was relaxed and fun. The service was very attentive and friendly. Our food came within a reasonable time and the presentation was gorgeous. I think most of their rolls have a spiciness or little kick to them. We will defintely be coming back.<//Text>

I don't know what took me so long to find this restaurant I live right up the hill and I'm so glad I found it......it is delicious!!!

customer service is OK I feel they take a while to come to your table to check up on you but other than that the fish is fresh and prices are affordable.....

I am definitely going to be coming back----but do they have happy hour???? does anybody know? We didn't see it on menu when we visited last and didn't bother to ask bc we were just so hungry we didn't care lol< /Review>

So very pleased with this place.  Truly a great find!  Fresh, well-prepared sushi.  I've tried them all, and this is definitely the best sushi on the eastern side of South OC.</Text>

Sushi: Golden Terra roll is phenomenal, Katsu dinner is great.. look out for Tuesday hand roll specials ($2.50) and salmon Wednesday specials. Take out looks pretty too (see pic)</Review>< pictures>

I love Terra sushi! Their sake selection is fantastic and reasonably priced for sake from Japan. The sushi (nigiri) is my favorite part and all of it is fresh and flavorful. The rice is always fresh and the fish is always fresh. The cut rolls are good too, not anything super special but still delicious and worth trying. I recommend the Caterpillar roll because the fish is fantastic!< /text>

Excellent food. Great variety. Good service. We went around 4:15pm for Happy Hour. Small menu for happy hour and we also ordered off the regular menu. We had the seaweed salad , Rock n Roll, and the Protein roll. I cannot eat a lot of rice and these were all rice free. Not only were they beautiful but very tasty! We will definitely be back.<//review>

<review>Really impressed with this place. Very nice and welcoming design and atmosphere inside. Upon walking in I was greeted by all staff in Japanese - love it! Server was very attentive and helpful. The sashimi was extremely fresh and delicious. Also the Oreo tempura desert is ridiculously good. New favorite sushi place. Will be back again soon! Thanks guys, keep up the good work.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>This is a great local place if you're looking for a traditional Japanese meal! The food is great, and the employees are very friendly and helpful. The only thing you should really worry about are their bento box portions. You might wanna take a box of that home. Othrr than that, I'd really recommended this place!< /Review><UserId.>102474557630408793495<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x80dce9a5d59800e3:0xb076a7d007693840< /gmap_id><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

<Text>Sushi is excellent, not so sure on the Teriyaki Chicken in the Bento box which I've had in the past. Although very moist, we found it to have little flavor.  Also, service is a disorganized, went with my husband during a not so busy workday.  He ordered sushi and received his meal a good 20 minutes before I received my bento box order.  Like most people, I want to eat at the same time as the other person I'm with.  Although the waitress kept apologizing, it spoiled the experience.  It will be a long time before we return, if ever again.< /Text>< UserId.>

Served quantity over quality, in my opinion.

Had bento box and yakisoba. Prices were a bit takai. Came with a lot of food with both orders. The meat in the bento box was OK, not wonderful quality, but you got a LOT.

Would have been nice to get higher quality food but less of it.< /Review>

Not a fan. The service and friendliness of the staff keeps this from 2 stars, but if you have experience of higher quality sushi, you probably won't enjoy.</text>

<Date>1547618731636<//Date><response>None<//response><Review>Terra Sushi is a great option for lunch or dinner sushi if the food quality is your primary concern. If possible I would rate 4.5 stars only deducting for the size of the in-restaurant dining compared to other sushi options in the area.

This next statement is entirely debatable and my own personal opinion. I put it here only to ensure that this review is only valued if read in a TIMELY manner. I am of the personal opinion that sushi places have the best quality fish at the beginning of their existence and tend to degrade over time as they make the trade off between cost and reputation. I will do my best to update this review if I notice a change in Terra's food or service as clearly from my rating I intend to be a repeat customer.

Because there are so many different preferences in "sushi" I think it is important to quickly describe my personal preferences. I am unquestionably "American" in my preferences in that I prefer "sushi" to have multiple layers of flavor, and evaluate it based on the quality of each ingredient included in the roll I ordered. While I can enjoy sashimi (although my preferred style is nigiri), if I order a roll with multiple ingredients I expect EVERY ingredient to be of similar quality. Many sushi places pay a lot of attention to one ingredient but seem to devalue others. Terra pretty clearly completely understands the construction of sushi "soup to nuts". I could very happily order a bowl of sushi (meaning only the vinegrated rice) take it home and construct my own rolls and be happy with the value.

They have a good offering of the carnival style rolls many Americans have come to expect, and everything else I would expect from another similar sushi joint with the exception of steak options. I don't mind this (and in fact respect the limited options similar to In-N-Out) as they seem to be just trying to stay in their lane. Teriyaki Chicken however was refreshing in that is was a little watery and soy-based rather than some of the sugary styles out there. As far as service, I have not actually dined IN the restaurant. If the wife and I actually get a night out without kids, I am looking for a little more ambiance and would likely be willing to gamble a bit on quality to get a more robust "dine in" experience. While picking up my orders however, this has struck me as a great place for an efficient dining experience when running behind for a movie rather than a place I could happily spend 1.5 hours.

Between Einstein's Bagels next door (for light breakfast), Baja Fish Tacos for lunch, and this....I could happily eat three meals in one day in this center.< /Review><UserId.>108731747713367167122< /UserId.>< user_name>

Brisa took our application over the phone and automatically qualified us for a 20% discount! On top of that I was at work and only had a 15 min break and couldn't meet at their office. Brisa sent her mobile agent Robert to meet me at my work and we signed the paperwork in less than 10 mins! From their Robert left to post the bond!

I am very happy that in my time of need I gave Santa Ana Bail Bonds a call. Their agent Robert was extremely professional and polite to deal with. He provided us with excellent customer service from start to finish. Robert updated us often on the status of the bond and was able to qualify the bail bond for a 20% discount! Great overall experience with this bail company.</review>

Santa Ana bail bonds was nothing short of great. This bail company was recommended to me by a friend and once I read some of the reviews they had I felt confident that they were the ones that could help me out. They seemed to really care about my case and made sure that I was properly taken care of throughout the entire process. I am so grateful that I reached out to them for assistance!<//text>

I got an unexpected phone call in the middle of the night that my son had been arrested on a warrant and was in shock. Santa Ana bail bonds was the perfect company to call for help. They couldn’t have been more respectful and understanding. They went above and beyond to help me out considering the time and eased any worries that I had about my son. We were in good hands with this company and I would call them again if need be.< /review>

I called here and received the best help I could’ve asked for. Not an ideal situation that my friend got himself into but luckily for him I called Santa Ana bail bonds and they saved him. I’m sure he wasn’t too thrilled about being arrested but they made everything better and were so nice during the entire time. Thank you guys for being so great to us, your service is excellent!<//text>

<Review>Obviously no one wants to need a bail bonds company, but this company hands down is your best option.

I reached out to a few other companies needing to schedule an RPM on a weekend (with an incredibly low bond) and none of those companies even bothered to call me back. Luckily when I called Santa Ana Bail Bonds they were more than willing to give me the time and help me out. They made the process easy and couldn’t have been more kind.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

A horrible situation got my wife caught up with the law and we were so fortunate that we called Santa Ana Bail Bonds to help us out. With a little one at home and no one to watch her, it made this incredibly stressful situation even worse. The agent I spoke with was understanding and more patient with me than I could have ever expected, I was blown away by her kindness. They were able to locate my wife and she was released before I knew it. Incredible agents working here, they really know how to take care of families, especially in scary times.<//review>

When I first knew I had to use a bail bondsman I was worried about how things would go, but Santa Ana bail bonds was on top of it. My son was arrested and as soon as I got in contact with someone here, they jumped right on his case. No one wants to hear that their child is in jail, but unfortunately they get themselves into bad situations. I am just glad that I had someone so caring to help me get him out quickly.</review>

<review>This was the first time I had to contact a bail bonds company and I was a bit nervous, but shortly realized I had nothing to worry about. Santa Ana Bail Bonds was the company I needed and I am so thankful I contacted them to help me out. The staff were very professional and informative and had the bond posted within minutes after all the paperwork was processed. I will definitely be calling this company again if I ever am in need of a bail bond company again.</review>< pictures>

Santa Ana Bail Bonds is by far the best bail bond company in the county. Some bad luck and unpaid traffic tickets ended with my brother getting arrested and I had no idea what to do after I got the call. After doing some quick research I found this company and saw that it had great reviews, and they weren’t wrong! I recommend giving them a call if you’re ever in a similar situation or just need help, they definitely know what they are doing.<//review>

I’ve been pretty busy lately but finally am getting the chance to thank these guys for making an experience that no one wants to deal with simple and painless. They were able to handle everything over the phone and even offer payment plan that worked best for me to ensure that I could afford bailing out my sister. I pray that I won’t ever have to deal with a situation like this again but if so I know who I will be contacting for help wherever I am.</review>

Save yourself from looking for the best bail bondsman, Santa Ana bail has the best deals and the nicest people working there to help you. I had 2 people checking around the area to help bail me out and they were the only ones that were fast to release me and went above and beyond.< /Text>

I had to bail out my aunt this weekend, for reasons I do not want to get into. Well I don't know the area so I googled Santa Ana Bail Bonds and this company seemed like the best bet. After speaking to the nicest agent I was convinced, let me point out that I didn't just go for the friendliness. They clearly know their business! Very informative! The site itself has so much info (I was on there for a while), things about DUI, Rights and others definitely worth looking into. Thanks Marco for making the bail experience much easier!</Text>

Thank you Santa Ana Bail Bonds for all the help! Where do i begin...when you get that call everything stops. You don't know what to do or how to react, because you have all these emotions running around your mind. Got myself togoether and searched companies, i decided to go with this company, not only because they have good ratings but their website had so much information! They even have information on current laws that affect the average person. Anyways the minute i called they were able to let me know what was going to happen, and what to expect step by step. The good thing is that they were able to do everything over the phone. Thanks for everything!</text>

<Review>The shock of finding someone you care about was arrested, is very real. Besides the fact that you start questioning, why it is scary to think what they are going through. You want to help as fast as you can. So we asked around and found thses guys Santa Ana Bail Bonds. Like i said it was a bit of a haze, being confused and what not. But what i do remember is the agent Marco treated us with compassion. I want to thank you guys for all the support. When they told us how much it was going to be to bail her out, we nearly fell out of our seats, like serioulsy who what that kind of money laying around! Thankfully they set us up with a payment plan, and a nice discount. Thanks agaian.< /Review>< pics>

I never thought that what happened would ever happen to me and my family.  My cousin started a relationship with this blatantly obvious gold digger and everyone told him that it would bite him in the ass but he didn't listen.  She convinced him to take in her and her two kids, a 16 yo girl and a 12 yo son, bacause she didn't have a place to live and he was stupid enough to not listen to any of our advice.  After a few months he then realized what was up and he told her to leave.  When he got back from work his house was cleaned out and she was nowhere to be found.  That same night he then gets arrested for lewd acts with a minor.  She had her daughter make everything up!

No one in my family ever got arrested for anything so none of us knew what to do.  Luckily, one of my cousins worked at a law firm but he didn't do criminal law but referred us to an attorney that did.  Atty. Mosqueda told us to bail him out immediately because people with this charge are in danger if they make it out to county jail.  He gave the number to these guys and a lady named Sherry really went out of her way to help us.

They got my cousin out as soon as the police knew he didn't have warrants and never got arrested before.  Thank God for the small graces even in such dark times.  Without Sherry, my aunt would have had a heart attack.

I hope you never need to go through what we have gone through but I can sincerely and confidently say that without their help we would have been so lost.</Review>

I always thought I would get a call from my brother to bail him out, turns out my sister took the price. All I could say on the way to bail her out was WOW. So we're driving down to OC and mind you my mind is all over the place, I'm calling a round, and I have no idea how to go about the situation. So I talk to Marco from Santa Ana Bail Bonds, and he calms me down. He explained what was going to happen, then he asked me if we had AARP or was a union member. Thank God my husband is part of the Union, cause we were able to get a discount! I don'tknow what I would have do e if Marco was not so helpful. Thank you so much!! Great experience, beside the fact that my sister was arrested, everything else went smoothly.<//text>

We had a great time here with family and friends.  The kids enjoyed riding the tubes and the sleds on the little slope.  There was a section of the park that was open where we had an awesome time playing in fresh snow.  The only thing that I didn't enjoy was bringing the tunes back up the hill after getting down.<//review>

Kids had fun playing. We had a large group and got a discount of $17 per person. More easy to swallow that price vs their standard $25. Expect long lines and medicore slopes for tubing. Trust me, your teenage kids won't enjoy this place and you will leave with a sour taste in your mouth.</text>

<review>I really enjoy the outdoor swimming year-round. The pool is usually between 78 and 82 degrees sometimes it feels like it's going to be cold when you're going to get in but it's usually just right no matter what the weather. I really enjoy the hot tubs there are three 2 outside by the lap pool 1 over by the steam room and sauna. My wife really enjoys running on the treadmill and using some of the equipment in the gym. I know some of the staff they're super nice I've heard the swim lessons are amazing in the summer. Not too many places I'd rather be on a hot summer day than outside on the pool deck enjoying a nice lunch. I believe if you want to drive golf balls you need to get your tokens inside Trout creek. They have a lot of parking if you have like a giant car you could totally park it in their parking lot. The snow play center in the winter is pretty sweet it's it's on the driving range there's also Summer Concert Series right there which is really really fun and everybody should try and get tickets and go. Tahoe Donner is awesome.< /review>< pics>

I've been to Trout Creek Rec Center many times while renting summer houses in Tahoe Donner. It's a giant disappointment & really misses the potential it could have to be the only resort / rec center in the North Tahoe area. Here are the reasons why: the price is astronomical & sets the guest up to expect great things when paying the (reduced) rate of $15 per person (kids over age 6 have to pay the adult rate). Then, Trout Creek fails to meet even modest expectations. 1) staff ranges from unhelpful to rude. Need a towel? They're part of the price of admission, but they won't tell you that. They are kept behind the counter at the front desk. 2) As of 2019, the place is under massive construction & half of it is closed. They do not tell you this when taking your payment. What's worse? The construction is happening while the place is open. Buzz saws, hard hat areas, and literally a guy painting the ceiling as we walked under it! 3) The new sauna room smells like MRSA lying in wait 4) The pool itself is "kind of" clean in certain areas. In one large corner, pollen and dead bugs gather and it has always been this way. 5) Exercise classes are subpar; don't waste your money. I saw an instructor  doing leg lifts on all fours with a sway back. 6) The pool is cold all summer long.  One good thing about the facility is when Marco Polo Grill is open -- they offer poolside food service. It's fun and pretty tasty. However, they keep limited hours and don't open until late June.</Text>

Great place to spend a half day with little ones.  Lots of snow playing area, sledding and tubing.  Lines can get long but the waits aren't too bad.<//Text>

If you don't have your own sleds this is a good choice...but if you do I'd go elsewhere.</Text>< pics>

<rate>1<//rate><Pics>None</Pics><Review>I paid $44!!! yes $44 to play with a 2 year old and a 6 year old in the snow. Of course you can't bring your own sled either - capitalism at its best...
Where are we going as a society where a movie trip for two adults and two children costs you $100 and where playing in the snow on a little hill cost you $44 - and that was just one adult and two little kids. NEVER again!!!

Driving up from Sacramento made this a $100 weekend just to play in the snow.<//Review>< UserId.>

Prices have gone up in 2016-2017 winter, and it getting pricey. $25 for Public Adult and $14 for Public Child. Sleds and tubes are provided bc no outside equipment is allowed. With the same price, Donner Ski Ranch ($25 per 2hrs of snow tubing) is better with carpet.

There is No carpet to go back up, so you can't play long. The sled slope is very short.

Outdoor restroom. Cold while waiting. Public is not allowed to access the club indoor restroom.

Snow play without soft snow is boring because snowman can't be built from ICE.</Review>

Great facilities, but tough on guests. Tahoe Donner provides excellent facilities such as this pool and gym, and I love the yoga offered. The policy toward guests is crazy though, $8 to use the hot tub.</Text>

Way over priced for what they offer.  The tubing was super short and safety seemed to be over fun.  They asked for my 3 year old to walk back up the hill rather than being pulled in the tube.  $25 per adult for 2 short tube rides and 1 super short sled hills. WAY over priced.< /text>

<Text>I originally rated this 5* but just came back a year later and had to fix my rating. I found that the prices for guests had been raised 50%. The hot tub was not hot, only half the jets in the lukewarm tub were working, the towels must have shrunk in the wash because they are half the size they used to be, and the waiting benches all had their cushions removed so you can't sit in them, no paper towels in women's restroom etc. I gave feedback when giving back the keys and was told the cushions got wet and were never replaced (at a water facility) and the fees went up in January so we should've been paying them since then, instead of a simple apology for the poor experience. We used to come at least 1x a week as guests from our seasonal rental and now are considering changing rental location because of the poor service we received while here. Super disappointed.<//Text>< Date>

And no reduction in price when they only have one tube run open (the only interesting thing there even for a 3 year old).

Go to a park and save 35-50 bucks.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>My nurse was super amazing!! I am the most sensitive person when it comes to any sort of feminine health- the pap and the UDI insertion was seriously so well done. I was informed step by step and it was seamless. I was so thankful to my nurse, I even wrote her a thank you note. It meant that much to me that the procedures went really well.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I like coming to this office. I like that it’s an all women staff, it makes me feel more comfortable. They are very informative and very friendly. My office visits usually are between 1 hour to 2 hours I guess it just varies on how busy they are so be prepared to be there for a bit. Overall 5 stars.< /Text>

Overall I got what I needed to be done . However , there is NO compassion from the staff when dealing with certain situations there . I won’t go into detail but don’t expect any sympathy or warmth . They do Not care ... but the process was fast and I’m
Thankful I was able to go
Through it quickly .<//text>

<Review>All the staff are helpful, friendly,  and attentive.

This is my go to clinic the only thing that I would say is a bad experience is that there isn’t much privacy in there . When you walk in a nurse has you explain what’s wrong and there isn’t a door it’s just dividers on a desk to separate you from another person . You can hear what they’re saying about you while you’re in the waiting room . It’s a bit embarrassing that you go into the clinic trusting them to help you and then you hear them shouting things outside the door about you. It’s unprofessional. I wish there was more privacy in this clinic<//review>

Wooohoo! I am so impressed how hardworking and friendly every individual in this office is. Scheduling an appointment online is EASY, they send and remind you of your appointment as well. I have been a patient here for maybe 5 years now and each time I am leaving happy and feel very confident in the services they provide. My Care coordinator Susan was able to explain everything to me clearly. My reason for this review is the exceptional Tierra! She is pure gold! She helped me with my IUD insertion and removal. Tierra is knowledgeable, personable, and very professional. Thank you FPA Women Health Mission Hills office!<//Text>

<Text>I was feeling nervous about going to a clinic during COVID, but I needed to see a provider about my birth control method. FPA Women's Health Clinic is amazing! It's located on the 2nd floor in a business building and there's a large parking lot behind the building. The chairs in the waiting room were spaced out, masks were required, and the clinic was clean. The medical assistant who helped me and the PA Tierra were so kind, patient, and quick! They answered all my questions. I was in and out after 1 hour. I will definitely be back for any of my reproductive needs!< /Text>< resp>

<Review>I had an horrible experience here. The ladies that help you get set up are wonderful. However, the ultrasound tech, Tierra and her assistant are the worst. I could hear them talking about me and saying MY PERSONAL stuff out loud and everyone else could who was waiting. All 3 of them weren’t at all considerate of my feelings. I’ve read good reviews about Tierra and I was expecting her to be nice to me as the other people have stated. But all 3 of them are the worst and should not at all be working there. I went to a different location in San Bernardino and it was amazing! There’s actually privacy and all the staff are considerate and make you feel comfortable. San Bernardino is worth the drive due to how great you’ll be treated there rather than here.</Review>< pictures>

<review>This is by far the best women’s clinic I have been to. Compared to similar places like planned parenthood and WIC and even other FPA locations, I have always received the quickest and most efficient care at Mission Hills. I know wait times can usually be a bit long so I try to schedule during the week in the morning and that seems to work out the best for me, I’m usually in and out in an hour. I get everything I need from birth control to annual exams and testing done here and the providers are always kind and knowledgeable. Also, the girls who do the blood draws are awesome. I don’t do well with having my blood drawn but they are super quick about it so I’ve been getting better every time I go in. Highly recommend!<//review><Name>Alyssa Dinson< /Name><GmapID>0x80c2908a46142dc5:0xc5085f183cfc08e8< /GmapID>< Rating>

This place is a joke. They are completely unorganized and don't go by what time you actually make your appointment. I sat in the waiting room watching people come and go while my girlfriend just sat in the back room waiting.......completely unprofessional.
Go anywhere else. Now to add to my review most people do same day testing......it's been 2 and a half weeks and still haven't got any results back. This place is an absolute joke I wish I could give negative stars.<//review>

The wait time and gotten 100% better. In and out with in 45 mins. The best staff! They make you feel so comfortable and Knowledgeable when you leave. Couldn't ask for more.

To a comment I saw this place isn't Sexist! In the name it says Women's health! If I went to a place that said men's health. I wouldn't expect them to see me.</Text>

Dr Mann is the best. I choose to go here just for her. She's worth the 2 hour wait!!! Most of the girls that work there are friendly but there's a few who could use some better training on how to work with patients. I used to go to facey but once I met dr Mann I changed over to their clinic< /text>

<date>1563297054592<//date><rate>5</rate><review>(Translated by Google) THE BEST CLINIC. !!!!!!!!!!!
The people who work there are very friendly, the place is clean and they have security cameras I felt calm because while I was in consultation my children were in the waiting room I thought it would take hours like other clinics but it was not like that We were in the place less than 1 hour.
Without a doubt, it is the best
I recommend it!!!!!!

(Original)
LA MEJOR CLÍNICA.!!!!!!!!!!!
Las personas que trabajan ahí son bien amables,el lugar está limpio y tienen cámaras de seguridad  me sentí tranquila por que mientras yo estaba en consulta mis hijos estaban en la sala de espera  pensé que tardaría horas como en otras clínicas  pero no fue así el tiempo que estuvimos en el lugar fue menos de 1hora.
Sin duda es la Mejor
La recomiendo!!!!!!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

When you go into Eye Q they treat you like old friends. From the moment you walk into the office until the time you leave, the experience you have with each person you encounter is wonderful. I will never go to another optometrist again!< /Text>

Local eye Optomogist and service members treat you like a VIP! I brought in my designer sunglasses then had my prescription lens. Also ordered the cool magnetic clip ins one for readers on sunglasses and dark tint over my readers. I have VSP towards one pair purchased four!! They are amazing and one on one service!! The only place to go is EYE-Q OPTOMETRY!</text>

<Text>Dr Q and the team are always great.  They are always friendly and really get involved with making sure that you get the new glasses you love.
2 weeks ago my currently glasses broke :(. I stopped in and they fixed then for me… not perfect because the ear thing was broken, but they pirates one from an old pair of glasses and made mine (although different colors!) functional.  And for free!  Now I’ve had my eyes checks and my new, beautiful glasses are on the way!< /Text><Name>caron russell< /Name>< Date>

Awesome staff, very helpful and patient.  Have a good selection of frames and Erica was very honest about which frames were good and not so good.  Tried other eye doctors but came back.  Dr. Melody is very compassionate about getting you the best care for your eyes. Love the new facility much better than previous building.</review>

My husband and I had a very good experience at Eye-Q Optometry. The staff is professional and welcoming. The office has high tech equipment juxtaposed with colorful, interesting art which created a fun and easy environment. Dr. Melody is super smart and down to earth and made us both feel very comfortable and taken care of. It all added up to a pleasant Doctor visit.

We would highly recommend!</text>

The staff at Eye Q are absolutely amazing. My family has optometry services covered through Kaiser, but we pay out of pocket for VSP insurance solely so we can go to Eye Q. They are attentive, caring, and devoted to their patients. They go above and beyond for us every single time. Thank you Eye Q!<//review>

<text>Eye-Q was great! They had a very good process in place to ensure client health and safety as you enter the office and begin the exam. The team works very well together and my comfort was always important to them. All phases of exam was explained and my questions were answered. Following the eye exam a technician helped me select new frames from a very good selection.  I will definitely be back for my next visit.</text>< pics>

Dr. Quenzer picked up on an eye problem that I didn't even know that I had.  Her information allowed me to get the help I needed to prevent much bigger problems later on.  I like these guys!</Review>

I had an emergency eye need, and after calling various recommended optometrists, Eye-Q was the one willing to work to get me in sooner rather than later so I could see. The employees were very friendly and the Dr was certainly knowledgeable. The location is kept very clean, and glasses presentation is certainly an added aesthetic.
Thank you for getting me in so quickly and dealing with my issue in a quick, professional, and positive manner. I would definitely recommend this place and go back myself.<//Text>

<Text>As always a very pleasant appointment. The doctor and her staff are professional, helpful and always soothing. I work for a health system and they have excellent eye care yet I choose to come to Eye-Q and will continue to in the future based on the treatment at Eye-Q. This is a great office in all ways.

This has been a great place for my family to our glasses. I called because I bent my glasses and can’t see without them. They got me in the same day, even with all the Covid craziness ...and fixed me right up.  We talked about concerns of kids being in front of screens all day and suggested blue light glasses to help. I had no idea they even existed before all of this! Thank you!!</text>

Fabulous doctor who cares about her patients.  Her staff is also wonderful and everyone clearly enjoys helping people get their vision to the best it can be.

The Dr. observed a broken blood vessel in my left eye and referred me to a retina  specialist. My exam was very thorough and in my opinion very professional.

The staff there treated me like I was a long time patient. They were very nice and knew exactly what needed to be done.
Dr. Q explained in very understandable terms exactly what she was doing and what I could expect with my follow up treatment. She took her time with me and I never felt she wanted to get on to the next patient.
I appreciated her willingness to answer all my questions and never making me feel rushed.

The selection of eye glasses is great. They have something for everyone.
I can only give Dr. Q the highest rating and would recommend her to anyone needing an eye exam and/or glasses.<//Text>< Time>

< Review>
I could go to an Optometrist for the company I work for as they are all fine and capable Optometrist and Professors.  I go to and will continue to go to Eye-Q Optometry because Dr. Quenzer is a great Optometrist and her staff is first rate.  They have always nailed mine and my families prescriptions. These are people who shine an excellent light on their profession and the city of Lincoln.< /Review>

All of the staff at this office treat each person with courtesy, professionalism, and friendly way, never seeming to be bothered any time of day I have stopped by. Dr. Melody is extremely thorough and I have visited many Optometry and Ophthamology Depts over my years, both in VSP and Kaiser Permanente systems. The frame selection is very good, and I even had the opinion of at least 4 staff persons in choosing my frames.<//Review>

Dr. Q is the best! I go to her for all of my family's eye needs. She's helped us many times and has even offered to work with my mother who has advanced Alzheimers, and isn't always the easiest patient by far. Everyone else who works here is great too! Love all the smiles every time.<//review>

My eye doc retired so I moved to Eye-Q. I felt welcomed and cared about right away. Dr. Q is very thorough and very professional. Front office is also great. I have a new eye doc.< /review>

<Review>I’ve been going to Eye-Q for years and they never fail to impress me with their professionalism, knowledge, array of products, and superior customer service! They are so very kind and abundantly so.
My sons who are now adults still go to Eye-Q as well! It’s a super place.<//Review>< Resp>

Dr. Quenzer is the very best Eye Doctor I have ever been to & I am 67 years young.  Dr. Quenzer is knowable, considerate, warm and she goes the extra mile to help each and every one of her patients.  The staff at Eye-Q Optometry welcomes each patient and treats them with warm and consideration. The VERY BEST!!</text>

I rated 4/5 and had a very good visit.

Pros - Nice environment with with a friendly staff. The office has a corky theme that dosent take itself too seriously. The staff and office were nice and very good with the kids. I never felt rushed, pressured or like "Just another patient".

Cons - The proccess was abit slow and some of the questions were abit personal. I felt like the staff was abit relaxed and the process was different than usual. I wasnt quite aware of some of the add-ons unitl I asked (Lenses) and my daughter loved kid frames but the size was wrong.

Summary - 5 stars would be VERY hard for me to give anyone. This place faced some obstacles with my visit but adapted at every turn. Even when my daughters frames didnt fit they dug into a shipment they just recieved. The lens person was very knowledgeable about any questions asked and even demonstrated differences. The eye doctor was equally knowledgeable and made the visit feel personally taylored to me. Thank you guys for finding a way to make my flex delay work and the outstanding visit.

Edit*
We were contacted Thursday or so. After paying a little over 1200.00 on monday I thought my glasses were in. I called nack Saturday only to be told that due to a misunderstanding my glasses were just being proccessed on Saturday. So even though the office got their money and messed up my 10 day wait started 6 days later.

No mention of anything to compensate or make things right. Appreantly once they have your money any burdens thereafter are all yours.

DISAPPOINTING.<//text>

Probably the worst Flame Broiler I've been to. Customer service cold and short, and speaking of cold my rice was not fully cooked and my chicken tasted a bit tangy. Lets hope I don't get sick 🙏.<//Review>

The magic sauce is loaded in added sugar, so the food is only healthy if you get it without the sauce. I wish they had a sauce option that wasn’t half its weight in sugar.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Guy at the register was really rude to us and couldn’t “understand” our order... I think he was the owner.  Learn how to communicate and not give attitude to your customers. I also gave it a one star because the food was completely cold and had no taste, looked old. Stay away from this place. There is a reason why they give you smaller portions than the other flame broilers because they are looking to make more profit at your expense especially around times like these.. unacceptable!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>never neem to this store and will not be back. The cashier seemed rude and short. I asked for a reg bowl with chicken. She didn't ask what type of rice or if I'd like veggies. I always assumed it came with veggies and they would confirm which type of rice you would like. So I assumed it came with it. Once I asked they made it seem like we need to tell them. The cook stated even if your blind "you" need to know how to place you order?</Text>< Pictures>

<text>The cashier (with the lip piercing) was extremely short with me and rude. Manager nowhere in sight. I was appalled by her rudeness. All the customers said please and thank you and not one "your welcome" or smile or even acknowledgement from her. Ew!< /text>< Pictures>

This is a small home town theater. It is an inexpensive night at the theater. There are many restaurants near by. The production of "bone chiller" we saw was well acted and very enjoyable. My daughter had trouble understanding the Pediatrician, but she was surprised by the ending. The atmosphere was homey and small town. I will be looking for more productions here.< /text>

It is community theatre so my expectations were rock bottom, however it was a fun enjoyable night. All the people there genuinely care and while the catering etc was by no means polished , it felt like a genuine warm community of people that is rare to find< /text>

sandwiches are typical. they're good just not unexpectedly good for a sandwich shop. service was firefly and fast. decor is pretty basic.  location is good for parking.  I reccomend the Paul Reubens.

<Text>First time there. Six people working so I definitely think they have good subs. I put in my order and I wait.......and I keep waiting and still nothing. Finally I approach the gentleman who had taken my order and tell him that nevermind I want a refund and I'll go someplace else. He seemed genuinely surprised that my sub hadn't been made but still frustrated that none of the five other employers didn't bother to ask if I was waiting for an order. I might go back to try again at a later time. The gentleman did offer to make it up to me. It was a courteous gesture and I appreciated it. I will go back because it really does look good place. Hopefully I will be able to find out at another time.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Good, unique sandwiches, but I feel that the price is a bit higher and the sandwiches are much smaller than the competitors. For these reasons and because I think the sandwiches are not filling enough,  I wouldn't recommend it.

Also, for some reason on the company app there is a 1.99 surcharge not including tax even for an in-person pickup which doesn't make sense to me. Thankfully there is no surcharge in-person though.<//Review>

Great sandwiches and the menu is endless. There's something for everyone, even vegans. They have great customer service and made the sandwich super tasty and delicious. They sometimes have specials and even have featured sandwiches everyday. Definitely a good place to visit anytime you're in the area. Highly recommended by me...<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Ordering here is a gamble because I never know if I am going to get the sandwich that I ordered. They frequently give me an entirely different sandwich than I what I paid for, and usually it’s something I definitely don’t want. The most aggravating thing is they never pick up the phone, so I’m just stuck with some gross sandwich that I don’t want. I used to order here all the time because when they get it right, it’s so good! Recently, I’ve stopped ordering from here as much because it’s soooooo inconsistent and the service is lousy.< /Text>< time>

<text>**VEGAN OPTIONS**
I've loved Ike's for years, and tonight they proved once again how awesome they are!! I have never had a sandwich here I didnt like! So many fun, unique vegan sandwiches here! I recommend Meatless Mike, Vegan Pee Wee, Vegan Pilgrim, Vegan Handsome Owl. They offer vegan meats and vegan cheese. I was assured everything on our sandwiches was vegan including the bread and all sauces. Ike's makes ordering as a vegan easy!! Try the Voo Doo chips too! Check out their website, there are many locations and different offerings at each ❤< /text>< pictures>

Went to Ike's around 1:00 p.m. seemed very busy. Staff was friendly and efficient. Food was excellent. No easy parking, but worth it for the sandwich.</Review>

<review>Had to go past a ton of homeless and drug users in order to get to this sandwich shop. The smell of urine and dodging tons of poop stains already put a damper on my appetite.

Ordered the #126 Mark Appel and it only had 2 pieces of chicken in the sandwich. Definitely too pricey for what it is. The only redeeming factor was that I had it to go and the sandwich was made so tight that nothing leaked. That is a plus. Other than that, I wish it was bigger and had more meat.

This place also didn't take mobile payments. Other than that, at least the people there were nice.</review>< Pictures>

This is an awful place that made me wait for 20 minutes. I got ignored and received "can't you wait a bit more" as a response. Their food was what was taking me there but with this customer service I will not take a step towards them.< /Review>

Ike was absolutely delicious. The variety they have in their sandwiches is unbelievable.  They also have incredible flavor and I visit every time I am in San Francisco.

I would highly recommend Ikes to anyone who loves sandwiches or wants a new twist on a sandwich. I.e a roast beef sandwich with mozzarella cheese stick or jalapeno poppers on it.<//Text>

<Review>The Jose Andres aka "The Spanish Godfather" (3 stars) is my favorite sandwich at ink.sack.  It's Spanish charcuterie in a bite with saltiness of the ham and chorizo with the creamy manchego cheese with lightly dressed lettuce. My favorite thing at ink.sack is the BBQ pork rinds (5 stars). They have a nice crunch with a slight spicy kick.</Review>< GmapID>

<rate>2<//rate><text>What an unfortunate experience!!! 7 years ago I tried Ike's in SF for this first time and it was incredible. This time it totally sucked! This place needs to work on customer service...BIG TIME!
First off, our order of TWO sandwiches took 30 minutes even though they hardly had anyone in the restaurant. Then to make matters worse, my sandwich was made incorrectly. They made it with mushrooms when I had asked for NO mushrooms. I walked up to the counter and the Asian guy had a terrible attitude and said there was nothing he could do about that because he "only works here." I asked who could help me and he said the girl who took my order was on break and couldn't do anything until she came back. Seriously?!?! Luckily the Latino guy stepped in and asked what the problem was. I explained the situation and he simply remade my sandwich correctly. At least some people know how to do their jobs. The only reason this is a 2 star review instead of a 1 star is because the food was actually good. Ike's really has to check on their customer service training.<//text>< pictures>

They take forever to make one sandwich.
They are mostly walking around or chatting back and forth with each other the entire time.
It took over 20 minutes for one sandwich and then they made it with an item I said to not put in there because I have an allergy to.
I spent my entire break waiting on a single sandwich I couldn't even eat.
Then I was told it would take 3 or so days for my refund to reflect back into my bank.
Completely absurd. I will not go back and I will not recommend them to anyone (oddly enough I had just sent someone there an hour earlier saying they make great sandwiches) ever again.<//review>

The BEST breakfast burrito in town...Bagel sandwiches too!  Anytime I want to splurge on a hearty breakfast and juice; this is the place!  Plus they have my favorite soap Lavender Ranch!  Doug is always friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is casual, inviting and Artsy!  So much art on the walls it could be a gallery; kids area too!  My Favorite!</Text>

I love this sandwich shop. So does my boyfriend. Tons of huge amazing sandwiches. For my boyfriend, tons of regular good food. For me, tons of amazing vegan and vegetarian options. They always give us bonus suckers and are always great. Location means some shady people sometimes show up in the shop, but workers are great and getting to-go is our jam.</Text>

This place was a ‘must do’ on my husband and I’s honeymoon road trip. Years ago I had one of Ike’s delicious sandwiches at the original location and naturally I raved constantly to my husband about this place and made sure we got there on our trip. To our surprise, we were personally assisted by Ike himself who happened to walk into this location just after we did. He was very helpful and took the time to chat with us a bit about ingredients and recommendations. He even personally made our sandwiches. We were not disappointed. The sandwiches were amazing! The entire experience was excellent and we will keep spreading the word that Ike’s is the place to get a mean sandwich. Thank you Ike and crew! Keep it up!<//text>

Same great sandwiches as I remember from 2 years ago. I'm sad they aren't in that small hole in the wall place any more. It was so fun over there. But still, amazing sandwiches!< /Text>

This is a good sandwich place with tons of variety. All four people in our group liked what they ordered. Bread and meat tasted very fresh! Service was friendly too. It wasn't mind-blowingly amazing food, but a solid choice any time.</Review>

Great place! We got the Damon Bruce with the Dutch crunch bread. It was so gooood! I've been wanting to try Ike's sandwiches for years and I'm so glad we made the trip out to try it! I'm definitely getting the Kryptonite on my next visit. Oh yeah, the bonus lollipops that the cashier gave us was the cherry on top of a great experience and sandwich.</review>

My husband and I came here upon recommendation by a friend.  I got
a vegan chicken sandwich and LOVED IT. It didn't taste like chicken at all, more like fish, but whatever sauce they added to it was really good. My husband got another chicken sandwich and thought it was alright. We got an Uber here and didn't see much parking when we came. There was also limited seating, so we order our sandwiches to go.</Review>

<text>The idea of having an ike’s sandwifcrestaurant/deli specific app was pretty great in theory, after
Consideration, ordering, tipping and paying for 2 sandwiches and 2 bags of chips with a 25
Min later pick up time... it was a good thing I called to see if they could run the order out to me
Because at this location there is a bus stop in front...
Anyhow, it was the phone call that saved us from starvation. Lol. The bad: The app wasn’t working - so 30 min later I call to see if the order is ready because of the parking situation and I’m informed that they never got the order. Boo!  so the experience as a whole was frustrating but worth it in the end because the food tasted great!< /text>< rating>

The Damon Bruce was probably the best sandwich I've ever had, in my life. Asked my roomie if he wanted to trade bites of his sandwich and reply was, 'no way ' because his tuna sandwich was that good. Great place to go, if you're in the City!<//review>

<review>Ikes is hands down the best sandwich shop I have ever been to. My favorite is the Oakland location since they have the foxy boxy. Wish all locations offered the same kinds of sandwiches.

This sandwich shop can often have a wait but the sandwiches speak for themselves.

It's all about Ike's dirty secret sauce so make sure to try one of their many, many sandwiches and add it.</text>

<review>To preface, great place for really good sandwiches. Order the Dutch Crunch bread, it's baked by Ike's with their specialty "dirty sauce" baked in.

I dont know why "College Students" is a Yelp 'Highlight' for this place, or at all. Why is "College Students" a highlight- no, what is that even supposed to mean? Whatever..
You want sandwiches? They got sandwiches! You need an ol' fashioned soda? bAm, they got your sodas right here. This place is expensive, yes. It's also expensive in Danville, Concord, Walnut Creek and SFSU; it's because it's worth it if you truly value your sammy! The tastiest of samwiches sold here!</review>< pictures>

While most people waited in line over 2-3 hours for a free sando. Our media crew got ours delivered to our office and I was out with my usual meetups. A text came through asking where to leave my sando at. I reply by saying it'll take about 3-4 hours before I'll return. However, I'm nearby and I'll stop by and get it on-the-go. Workers were quick to make my sando per request of manager and I left with happy face.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Soft and watery sandwiches, not so fresh ingredients: it's not the best.
The staff is very friendly (the stars are for them).

(Translated by Google) The famous ike's from man vs food! I took a Michael Jordan meat ball, really soft rolls and made in the giant baguette. The turkey sandwich for children is also remarkable, so much so that my son ate only half of it so much that it was giant. The area however is not beautiful many homeless people just around the corner, I recommend going by car as we did and take away.

(Original)
Il famoso ike's di man vs food! Preso un Micheal Jordan meat ball, panini veramente morbidi e fatti nella baguette gigante. Anche il turkey sandwich per i bambini è notevole, tanto che mio figlio ne ha mangiato solo metà tanto che era gigante. La zona però non è bellissima molti homeless proprio girato l'angolo, consiglio andare in auto come abbiamo fatto noi e take away.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Flipantes sandwiches .. I saw it in carnivorous chronicles and we went to do the grace. They were dead! A little more expensive than you would pay for one in Spain, but they are worth it.
Very Deserved Fame

We were passing through on our honeymoon. As I was standing in line a lady approached me who was very nice and welcoming. As we were making small talk it turned out she was an owner. She helped show me some great products and then turned me over to the staff. All in all this place was great. I would definitely recommend checking it out and great quality product. When we come back I will absolutely stop in again. Thank you guys!</review>

<Review>Incredible! Not only is this a historical establishment (first dispensary in CA) but it literally sets the standard for perfect customer service.

<text>HPRC (Humboldt Patient Resource Center) is a fantastic Rec/Med cannabis shop in Arcata and Eureka. I had the privilege of visiting the Arcata location, which is located off 6th Street and J Street. I wish I could remember the gentlemen's name who checked me in, but alas, the product they sold me is too good, so it has slipped my mind! Either way, he was incredibly friendly, and got me checked in in less than 2 minutes, despite it being first time, super speedy! My budtender's name started with an R, I think Roxanne, she was so helpful that I could wax poetic about it! I was shopping for myself, my sister-in-law, and my mother-in-law, all of who have different tastes, and she hooked us up with great palette matches from some local growers, including their house brand! Coming from San Diego, where a few of our shops do accept debit cards, the minor inconvenience of cash is still the norm everywhere else; however I was prepared for that, so bring the green for the green! (there is a chase bank located a block away too!)
11/10 experience, will come back again the next chance I get to come this far north, where the best cannabis in the state is grown!</text><Resp>{'time': 1616604013994, 'text': 'You really made our day with such a stellar review of our Arcata Dispensary and team!

Highly professional staff and shop. Excellent products no matter what you're looking to get and inventory changes regularly. All tenders offer excellent info for those looking for it and will respectfully let you look on your own if you prefer. Careful of their up-selling, but even going for premium won't leave you disappointed.< /review>

Everyone who works here seem to be very friendly and knowledgeable and they are always well organized and have a good selection.

I have been going to HPRC for the last 6 years and have never been disappointed. Always fixing their mistakes which rarely ever happen(every few years if that), and always striving to provide great cannabis products to their community for a reasonable price. Thank you for supporting your community, whenever I’m off the hill I go to you for a little treat 😊<//review>

Very friendly staff, informational and professional. I enjoy the fact they can hold an item for me so i can have time to get there and not waste time or money or gas to come by and pick up. Very educated and helpful in informing new customers on the benefits of both thc and cbd products. They also have good deals on most their stuff and i love how they test everything before they sell it.< /Text>

Only place in town that has clones available, prices are a little high on some products but comparable to the one around the corner. I think set up is nice to help multiple guest at once. They do have reward program and events.< /Review>

The staff was rich on the money,dead right, informed as knowledgeable
Didn’t push the product
But truly understood
Haven’t been able to locate a place anywhere close to me near Santa Cruz
If my people didn’t bring me here I’d still be suffering

Forever grateful

<Text>The staff here are knowledgeable and seem to do their homework. Get there early if you want to avoid lines and the "late-arriving stoner crowd," which usually causes the lines in the first place. For legal cannabis products this is the best place in town. They help solve problems with faulty products, host different events in conjunction with distributors/growers, and offer a comfortable cannabis purchasing experience. They also have a points system so you can earn free stuff over time (kind of like a sandwich club). Nothing like free grass!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

California dispensaries are so horrible never ever go to one! 1000 times better off going to Oregon! Bend is ok but Eugene is best place in The USA to get herb and herb stuff. Got an once of best indoor I've had in my life for $56 in Eugene!! How that even possible? Got half gram cartirdges in eugene for $7 and worked good too!!

HPRC has been providing medical cannabis since 1999,  before any state moved to legalized cannabis, so we understand the frustration of what regulations have caused.  In regards to your comments about accessing the same indoor flower on the street we hope you understand that at HPRC we operate a Pesticide Free Policy that goes beyond State standards. Unregulated cannabis purchased on the street has no testing standard and can expose customers to many unregulated chemicals. With the recent increase in adverse lung effects from unregulated cannabis across the country we still suggest that patients access lab tested cannabis from a reputable company. In regards to prices, we absolutely think the taxes are atrocious and immoral! Applying a sin tax to someones choice of medicine is something we have spoken out against for many years. The $50 8th you commented on is $40.49 before taxes, which has been a standard price for top shelf indoor cannabis for many years. As for Oregon, we are grateful to be on the West Coast with great States like Oregon and Washington joining California in moving cannabis legalization forward!

As of February 2018 this is the best dispensary in Arcata. Seriously top notch customer service and huge selection. Some other places may be slightly cheaper however the customer service is unmatched.</Text>

Friendly staff and prompt service. A popular place so don't be surprised to see a line of people waiting but they keep themselves appropriately staffed to handle such a customer volume. I only wish they had a branch farther north in crescent city.< /text>

Also if you look at their application for compassion it's a joke a 1/8 or 1/4 a month of their shittiest bud isn't compassion. It's a slap in the face their applications for compassion state you can't make more than $800 mo. Disability and qualify disability in ca is 980 reg and 80 plus that if you can't cook properly. So I hope this has enlightened you on the processes of dispensaries no compassionate cases should ever pay and they should be given a lb a month or more for cancer seizures ty god bless< /review>< Pictures>

I go to HPRC pretty often and I always feel like this place has got it down when it comes to my idea of what a dispencery should be like.  Everyone is friendly and I really think they like what they do.  You feel that from the workers.  Its the best place I've been to up here.  Prices?  I mean its not cheap but that's usually the way it goes; you can buy it illegally if you wanna but sometiems its fun to get the good stuff.  Keep in mind Ive only been to HPRC and the dispensaries in Eureka.  I recomend anyone who likes pot to come here.<//Review>

<text>Once again, 2nd time, a great visit. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. An employee even saw my dog out in my car and brought out a milkbone! Which made his day and was a great reward for having to wait for me in the car. It looks much different than my previous visit. The budtenders were informed about the products, yay! And their prices were alot lower than the other dispensaries. 15 cheaper on some products. I like that they offer free classes like yoga and tai chi. The potency cap is going to be a problem for everyone though. Hopefully they have people lobbying for our rights to medication that works.</text><Date>1531376798453< /Date><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

Sorry to say that after several years as a loyal patient I will never step foot in this place again. Bragging about profits and how many new patients you have is not good business. If you are a kid looking to get loaded you're in luck. If you're an adult patient looking for help and relief......keep looking.</review>< pics>

Rude, obnoxious, and discourteous are the first things that come to mind. Then they made me feel unwelcome. Never set foot in this place unless you enjoy being talked down to and ripped off!<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Once again a total let down.   My wife stood waiting to buy 10 clones for a 1/2 hour while they let some idiot rummage through them and then he didn't even have money.  He wanted to trade hash.  So you sent him off and let him set them aside when everyone knew he wasn't coming back and wouldn't sell them to us.   You say first come first serve.   This is the last time you get any of our money.  And the guy didn't look he needed any medical help at all just some big smelly pot grower.  No wonder it so hard to get laws passed with people running businesses like this.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
Just bought some Gorilla Glue larf that was full of seeds. You guys should have used this stuff to blow oil instead of peddling schwag. Normally I'm fairly satisfied with what I get here but this stuff was a seedy larfy joke. Also the SFV I purchased had a bunch of perlite in the buds. I know that perlite is inert but it looks bad.</Review>

<Text>Great place to bring your individual baseball/softball player or with a small group of players. They used to have a slower pitch cage for younger players (8 and younger), which they no longer have, so would suggest 9-10 years or older. Pre-paid card is definitely the most economical option if you think you can come back and drop in for a few rounds at a time.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Conveniently located not too far coming off the highway on Rollins. I came here for a party and everyone had a blast. All of us never played baseball and the staff was pretty good about teaching us the basics and up to speed quickly.

The staff is also very nice, patient, and attentive... taking care of our party. You can choose to hit baseballs or softballs and choose the speed. Interestingly enough, the speeds are actually higher than stated because how close the ball-shooter is to you, so think about that when choosing your speed!

Would recommend and be back!<//Text>

<Date>1602226962355</Date><review>This is the best batting cage EVER, the customer service is awesommmeeeee!!! Plus, in the cages, the pitch is simulated so it has an experience like someone is actually pitching against you. I bought both of my bats here and it was an awesome process: First I tried it out then I bought it. If you're thinking of going to this place I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this place.</review>< username>

<Text>High-tech batting cages for baseball and softball. HD Pitcher display for a real game feeling. Highly qualified instruction from professional Giant's players and softball coaches. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff. Latest model bats and gloves for sale. If they dont have it they can happily order it. Brightly lit facility with clean restrooms. I love to go and play there by myself...I feel welcome every time I visit😄</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIv_LjZcSAZyu2rekMw6KEhnDjuz1fL1B9DjkG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtWM01MNv-HTI-uoiDYXdwXpotI9hD9lJKVMxC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrB79xzadmfkiz5yHQ5afTFDCzwlrFdFa3JyR2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x808f77cafd393e41:0xccecea040133750e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This is truly a unique batting cage setup, with (albeit low-res) animations of pitchers that accompany the pitches.  They have bats you can buy and some staff that are knowledgeable and super helpful.  I would definitely visit when traffic patterns permit.  During busy times, you have to alternate with others, just like good teammates do.  A little bit pricey but well worth the experience.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f77cafd393e41:0xccecea040133750e</Gmap_id></record>

Used to hit Malibu as a kid and just started bringing my own son here. Great facility, helpful staff, and mindful patrons who let kids slug it out at their own pace. Good prices too. Highly recommend since there aren't many other options on the Peninsula.<//Text>

<Text>Great baseball cages, they have video imaging of a pitcher going thru their motion with the machine.  Great for timing.  Staff is friendly.  Have great selection of bats for sale, even wood.  There is an area for teams to practice in-doors, seen lots of kids doing hitting and pitching lessons.  One of the best baseball cages I've ever been to.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Nice facility for practicing. They have a computer generated image of a pitcher that plays before the machine throws out the next ball so you kind of have an idea of when it'll come. There is no water fountain here but I was able to buy a bottle of Arrowhead water for just $1. Wish I had remembered to bring my own water bottle.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808f77cafd393e41:0xccecea040133750e</gmapID></record>

Well-maintained batting and softball cages, with different speeds for all ages. They also have two general practice areas, which are mainly used for pitching instruction. They do allow both aluminum and wooden bats in the cages, and they offer various baseball equipment for sale as well. If you're a frequent visitor like myself, save yourself some money and buy yourself a gift card, which gives a discounted price per round.</Review>

Keep count when paying for the 20 pitches for $6 option.  It pitches less then 15 before stopping.< /Review>

<review>Good bang for your buck.  This is just based on pricing for the BP cages.  You can get 20 rounds of 20 balls for $60.  These are dimpled balls so bring an aluminum bat, they have some there you can borrow.  Can't use wood bats and I've heard composites can get damaged with dimpled balls (if you want to practice with hard balls there are other more expensive places).  BIG BONUS - They have a simulated pitcher image with full motion to help kids timing, this is very rare in other places where you just get the std pitching machine.

From an instructional standpoint, you can't beat Terry for hitting.  Obviously the only MLB player on the Peninsula that has his own cage, so his instruction is going to be a bit more expensive than other places.  Well worth it for kids that are already physically coordinated.</review>< userid>

(Translated by Google) I could practice from slow softball to baseball and it was fun. Because the ball came out with the image, it was easy to take the timing. Many children were coming.

<review>Safeway seems to be one step ahead of the game when it comes to supper markets. Very well organized, extremely clean, they seem to have everything you're looking for. The price of products are fair. I like shopping at Safeway.<//review>< Response>

Found Bodi's Java on accident; met a friend from church there to discuss possible home buying options. Their coffee is AWESOME!!! Had a cappuccino and I kid you not, way better than any I've ever had! I'm also partial to local businesses and I'd support them first before a big name chain. Sufficed to say, I'll be back again and trying other items.</Text>

I’ve been shopping here for years and prefer it over the Safeway downtown because there is always parking, the Safeway store isn’t as crowded as downtown, has self-check and it’s conveniently located off 580. My go to’s include the credit union ATM, the post office store, Safeway, Subway, MT Nails and the Pet store.< /Text>

Ok, guys.  The secrets out.  Google catches me here all the time.  Not because there's a lot of pokemon go stops or gyms (there are and ive learned to hate that game as im sure many parents have).  But because we buy our food here.  I like this safeway, its got a nice staff, i dont freeze my....parts off.  Nice staff,lots of variety, yummy deli and bakery, florists, starkbucks, a bank.  Throw in a bar and a dance floor I'd probably never leave.<//review>

Stopped at Safeway to pick up a few things.  I like the layout and the ambience of the store.  Parking lot is sometimes tricky, but then again, I have always found a space.</Review>

Always busy, but the employees are always willing to help you. And they SMILE. New potato salad, WOW. My wife will never have to make it again as long as Safeway carries this item and the Mac. salad.</Review>

<text>I go because the Percocet has a better selection of my dog food, But do, and Amazon food, Lefebers, than other pet stores and Petcos.

The Verizon store is also a step up from most. More consistent and pleasant.

I was pleased to see that the lousy Barbecue place. Dickeys, is closed.  Never was very good.</text>< Rating>

<Review>Convenient strip mall off highway 580 offers a small variety of restaurants and shopping. Panda Express, Dickie's BBQ, Subway, Bodi's Cafe, PetCo, Safeway and more. Easy in and out and lots of parking, too. If you're looking for a gym, there's a 24 Hour Fitness that's clean and has a lot of equipment from cardio to weight machines.<//Review>< user>

I wouldn't call this a mall. There's a Safeway, a dry cleaners, a dentist, pet store, 24-hr. Fitness, nail place, coffee shop, etc.< /Text>

The Safeway is a bit small and doesn't carry everything a larger Safeway does, but it's clean, usually well stocked and the staff is friendly and helpful.</Review>
