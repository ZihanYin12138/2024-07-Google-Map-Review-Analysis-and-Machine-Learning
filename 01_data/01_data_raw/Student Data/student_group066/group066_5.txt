<Text>Pubby kinda food, but very good. They have added a small  healthier menu section with grilled chicken and veggies which is good. Their coupons and customer loyalty programs are very good.

Went with future star musician and singer Margaret Niles who used to work here. Really good food — cheeseburger egg rolls are certainly a unique idea — and high quality cocktails served by Nikki.</Review>

Cool local spot, was visiting friends, only went for drinks and ended up staying a bit longer than expected. Had a pretty good DJ playing some old school hip-hop 90's 00's and current hits. Drinks were fair, would go back whenever in town.<//Review>

<Review>Their reward system is a joke! So I had earned $20 in rewards by spending money at this place. That's supposed to be $20 I can use towards my bill. Well, tonight my bill was $34 and some change and I was not allowed to use all $20 worth of MY rewards. I could only use $10. Why? Because my bill wasn't large enough. Are you kidding me? I could see that happening if my bill was only $16 but not $34. I'm not happy with how this place has changed. I probably won't be back for a long while, if at all. Oh, the service was good so that earned them the second star.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1579620767424, 'text': 'Kevin:  This should not have occurred.

This is a cool bar with bar type food. Security is really on top things which actually makes for a nice environment. The beer selection is good, having a good range of beer flavors. And to add to the fun environment there is also pool tables and dancing! Nice place to go any night of the week!</text>

Good food.  Pretty good drink prices and even better happy hour specials.  The special the other night was any beer and a shot of Jack for 8 bucks.  Couldn't beat it.  They also had Fifty cent wings.  Definitely try at happy hour.<//Text>

<review>This is a popular neighborhood bar with some common ownership with  Shirasoni Japanese restaurant on Lone Tree.
They seem to attract and keep good bartenders and my recent visit was no exception. This visit was an unplanned lunch because our intended destination was closed. The menu is not for those on a diet and we didn't leave hungry. Food was prepared promptly and was fairly priced.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The drinks are great and the food never disappoints,  except the philly cheese steak sandwich was scorching hot with peppers. I like spicy but that was ridiculous.  Definitely could have used a warning. Still, good for the price .</Text>

This place is hit or miss with service. But the food is awsome. The beer is decent. The regulars can kinda be a little territorial. Which is not what you look for when trying a new place. Bar tenders are always on point, but servers seem understaffed on most nights. All in all a good place for food but don't expect great/prompt service.< /review>

<Text>If you get a headache from too much noise when you go to corporate sports-bar restaurants, this place is awesome. Plenty of big screens, a healthy variety of drink options and the food is better than the other spots. Great wings and burgers.

Oh, and it's less expensive too.< /Text>< Pictures>

KEEP TRACK OF YOUR TAB! This review is way overdue. I went here a few weeks back and when I did I found it kind of awkward that you had to take a picture to enter. The crowd was mixed, but in all honesty it was mostly young and ghetto. I started a tab and we were having fun, but the bartender girl was rude and had no clue how to make drinks. I ordered a Long Island for my bro and all she poured was gin and vodka with a splash of coke and S&S which was partially right. Then I ordered a Jager Red Bull but recieved Rock Star instead. What really got me though was when the girl next to me ordered 3 Coronas and was charged $17.25. That's $5.75 a beer and not even a good one. It's no wonder I noticed a lot of people babysitting and visiting their cars or pulling bottles from purses.
The cake topper to this though is when I went to pay my tab and it seemed extremely high for the 6 drinks I ordered. Nearly $100. I asked for a breakdown of my tab and she reluctantly got it and tossed it in front of me. Low and behold there were drinks on my tab I didn't order and when I questioned her about it she said my brother ordered them. I told her he doesn't even drink that drink and if he did he would have asked before putting on my tab. Then she said well he did too bad and I said even so she never okayed it with me and when I called my brother over he said the same thing I did. That he doesn't drink that and he wouldn't do it without asking. We got the manager or owner involved and he was like she already changed it and said he did. So knowing they can't bill me without a signed copy of the receipt I grabbed it and started walking out when he had all his guy stop me threatening me with the cops and physical harm if I tried to leave with the receipt. I told them to go ahead and call the cops, but he wasn't getting the receipt until the correction were made and the correct amount was charged. The I told my brother to call the police for him and then they jumped to rectify the situation.
I've talked to a few people about this and apparently it's happened to them or someone they knew not only at this location, but the Antioch one as well. So when going here keep in mind to bring enough cash for their overpriced drinks. Also don't expect any friendly service from the staff. parently it's happened to them or someone they knew not only at this location, but the Antioch one as well.

I was harassed and threatened by a security guard after a fight broke out that I was not a part of. I am 5'2 young woman and was absolutely terrified that the security guard would not consider my safety during the fight that I was NOT a part of, just a bystander but would rather scream at me to get out. I believe he was intoxicated. I called the manager about the incident and have not gotten a response. Clearly this bar does not take responsibility for their employees actions. I would not patronize this business nor would I recommend it to anyone. You are not safe at this venue.< /text>

She took our drink order, came back days later, took our food order, never came back, never brought our appetizer. We then ordered an appetizer from the bar to have delivered to our table that never came until we were done eating and had to ask for it again. Finally she appeared and we asked for refills and ranch, that came like 20 mins later. I want to go back cuz the food is good but I'm not sure the crappie service is worth it.<//text>< pictures>

I like this place. It's very kick back to have drinks n appetizers with friends during the day or to have drinks and dance during the night.<//Review>

<Name>Troy Tiscareno<//Name><Time>1366163101158</Time><rating>4</rating><text>I went to Tailgaters for the first time on St. Patrick's Day 2013 for Happy Hour with about 8 friends. We ordered drinks/beer and $2 appetizers.

It's a sports bar, so there were sports on all of the 20 or so TVs, but it wasn't loud, so we could easily talk in our group.

Our waitress was attentive and checked up on is regularly, and kept the drinks and food coming. Not mind-blowing service or anything, but above average at least.

The appetizers were excellent. $2 (at Happy Hour) will get you 4 wings in any of a dozen or more flavors, 2 big potato skins, a small but reasonable plate of nachos, or several other items, and at those prices, you can afford to order a wide assortment and share, which is what we did. The wing sauces were all very good, and we tried at least 6 or 7 different ones. The potato skins were also very good.

Decor was fine, but typical mom & pop sports bar, nothing fancy. They do keep the place decently clean, though, which is a plus.

Overall, we had a great time, and I'm looking forward to the Antioch location opening, as it's very close to me. I'm not normally a big bar guy, but I'll definitely be spending some more time at Tailgaters.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Dawna's Pet Parlor did such a good job with our pup! He came back to us looking so handsome and fluffy. And his fur is the softest it has ever been. They got this big boy done in about two hours. I am super impressed and this is definitely the best groomer we have been to. You can tell that they love their dogs. Thanks guys!</review>

She is one of only two people (the other being my mom) to whom I'd entrust with the care of my animal. So, if you're looking for a groomer that will both take great care of your pet, and do a fantastic job grooming, look no further!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Me and Chandler, the dog had a wonderful experience. He is normally a little anxious for nail trims but the patience, love and passion they have for fur babies is evident. You have to leave a messgae to secure and apointment and then they call you back with their availability. Kinda a run around but 100% worth it.<//Text>

<text>I've been here 4 times with my shih tzu Dolly and now my Peke Bailey. Dawna is so sweet and just has a great vibe. She was telling me all about pekingese's and knew my dogs personality in seconds. It was hilarious how she pegged him for his prissy ways immediately lol.  You can tell they really love every dog they groom. She's also very kind to my son who was being a little fussy. I never write reviews but I think people should know how lovely this place is. ❤</text>< pics>

<review>Redwood with Bayside Church is an amazing church. Their ministry and outreach programs are nourishing to the soul. I am so thankful that I had the opportunity to volunteer and attend this church. My kids ask me on Tuesday, "Is tomorrow Sunday"! Their children's program and events are amazing, and far beyond anything I could have hoped for in a church. Thank you guys, forever in a day!</review><user_id>111585400277245230560</user_id>< Rate>

I have been attending various churches for about 35 years.  Without a doubt Bayside Santa Rosa stands head and shoulders over all of them.  Centered around children's and youth ministries, Bayside for over two decades has flipped the script and has the youth leaders to prove it.

PLUS, they emphasize fidelity to the Word of God.   AND they reach out to the entire community through food distribution (2nd largest in Sonoma County), support for the homeless, service projects, outreach to the local schools.

Originally known as Redwood Covenant Church, we became part of Bayside Church after a two year transition, which in itself has been one of the most positive and rewarding experiences I have ever been through.

If you are seeking or looking for a church to belong to, please make certain you put Bayside Santa Rosa on your list.</Review>

Great place for worship, teaching, and community groups. Thriving high school and children's ministry. This church will push you and get you acting on your faith, been here 15 years and love it.<//text>

Formerly Redwood Covenant is now Bayside Santa Rosa campus. Best student & children's program ever.
This church is for people that don't like church. Amazing!< /Review>

I love this church. They are very welcoming and loving people there. Lots of ways to get involved and have fellowship. Great music and worship time. you can raise your hands if you want-I like that too! The congregation are very involved in the community as well. My kids are grown but they did go to the children's program when they were younger and they enjoyed it very much. Looking for a church home? Come on over!!!<//text>

RCC has been a great church for our whole family.  Children's programs are strong, and the middle school & high school programs are fun but inspiring for students.  Sunday morning worship is helpful, creative and a great way to start a new week. Very welcoming, but not pushy.</Text>

I love this place.  The music is contemporary,  the message is rich, yet entertaining with biblical teaching.  They never ask for new guests to stand, or identify their se. It is a high tech place which even has huge restrooms!  Lol.  We do a lot for the community in the way of grocery and clothing give aways monthly, loan space for fire recovery meetings, a HUGE free Fall Fun Fest, free outdoor movies, BBQ's, Divorce Support, Single and Parenting Classes, camps galore, small goups to join for personal support, kids through college-age, then Young Professional groups.  Senior groups and everything in between!  We even have a group that sews for Dress A Girl Around the World !<//Text>

This is church has been a home for me. If one is looking for a place were they feel a sense of belonging, RCC with open arms will give that to you. Redwood has a place for everyone, from babies to senior adults. I just got finshed with my first year in college and I am in college group which is filled with wonderful people and amazing leaders. When I was in high school I was involved with the high school ministries and let me tell you that there is no other place you'd want your children to be! Emmaus is what we call the high school ministry. It's fun, welcoming, has passionate leaders, and most of all God is the center of everything, just like the rest of the church. Redwood Covenant Church is not just a building but a family, and I am proud to call this place my home.<//Text>

Conceptually the experience is a surprise tasting menu supercharged with trophy wines and liquors. This all takes place at a 12 seat curved bar where you can see Ian assemble each menu item. Ian slow prepares the items in advance using slow cooking, curing, sous vide, etc. and then finishes the dishes in front of you. The food is great but then he uses his sommelier background to pair wines and in our case bourbons with each course. And not just any wines or bourbons, Ian is looking to take the mystique out of the trophy or cult brands (like Bryant Family, Saxum, Sine Qua Non, Stagg) and happily pours these to get diner reactions. The result by the end of the night will leave you in a state of rapture and eager to plan your next visit.< /review>< GmapID>

We walked out this evening thinking only of coming back.   Ian is providing food and wine a thousand steps above anything you are getting anywhere else. Smoked/dehydrated/rehydrated tomotaes were unlike anything else and delicious.  A steak better than any restaurant or home.  Homemade duck sausage with foie gras.  Risotto/raisin pudding and 16 day reduced oranges.  All of it paired with wine you won't have elsewhere.  A truly singular experience.</review>

We really enjoyed dinner here. Ian is a great chef and really explains the paired wines very well. Go w an empty stomach and hydrated so you can take full advantage of wine and food pairings! Great way to sit meet new people as well.<//Text>

We had the best time last with this experience at Somm's Kitchen.  Ian really outdid himself with this one! The 10 courses - including 4 different versions of duck (foie gras, pulled, breast, and sausage), scallops, and lamb - were each expertly tailored to 10 different Absolution Cellars
wines (plus 3 Champagnes).  It is the best on the Central Coast, a must do eexperience!</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I've been twice with my husband. First for our anniversary and again 6 weeks later to bring family last night. Ian and his staff are absolutely amazing and very welcoming. The food is inventive and delicious, but not stuffy. Ian's explanations of the food and wine are fascinating and down to earth. He is more than happy to try to accommodate allergies and preference (my husband isnt big on seafood). If you like good food and wine then hands down this is an experience that should not be missed whether you're visiting or a local like us. There's  no set menu to allow room for new experiments and to vary based on seasonal ingredients. Be sure to plan ahead as he books up!<//text>< pics>

<text>We did the chefs table.... Absolutely amazing experience. The man, the myth, the legend! I had heard him throughout the Paso Robles area from other industry and it was truely spectacular experience from the wine to the food to conversation. Blows doors on any other intimate food experience you could have. And BONUS now does liquor pairings with aged whiskey varieties. Blended beautifully with the wine. I am definitely going to come back and bring friends. This dude knows his stuff and humble brag he’s truely one a kind!<//text>< response>

<text>I’m still on the fence on this one.  On one hand I had a great experience wine tasting.   Food was tasty but left me quite hungry.  Had to go eat a real meal afterwards.

Let me explain.

About a dozen of you sit around a long circular bar type counter.  Owner/chef assembles small dishes that he pairs with wine.   Food is not cooked in front of you and is fairly easy to pull off.  Chef claims to have worked at a Michelin restaurant but these are not fancy dishes.

We had appetizers like sliced meats and cheese.  Also a warm soup.   Then came a chunk of salmon and a bit of steak.   Each dish was quite good but did not quite make a meal.  And I’m a small guy who typically does not eat much.

Each dish, however, was paired with a wine.  Wine education and pairing is the real strength here.    We had two kinds of bubblies, whites and reds.   They all quite good and paired really well.   When your glass was empty he would pour some more.   So that part was quite nice.

The seating is a bit peculiar.  Some people get the good seats and get to see what he is doing and others sit on the sides and don’t get much of his attention.  The people who came the latest (the ones we all had to wait for) got the best seats so not sure how that works.

Part of the way through another group enters and they sit in a back room.   Now they get part of the chef’s attention too.

Overall it was a fun experience. There was plenty of good wine to drink, but don’t expect a filling meal.  Would I go back?   Yah, likely, but I’d eat first.< /text>< Pictures>

<name>Kim O'Neill</name><Review>I've been twice with my husband. First for our anniversary and again 6 weeks later to bring family last night. Ian and his staff are absolutely amazing and very welcoming. The food is inventive and delicious, but not stuffy. Ian's explanations of the food and wine are fascinating and down to earth. He is more than happy to try to accommodate allergies and preference (my husband isnt big on seafood). If you like good food and wine then hands down this is an experience that should not be missed whether you're visiting or a local like us. There's  no set menu to allow room for new experiments and to vary based on seasonal ingredients. Be sure to plan ahead as he books up!< /Review>< GmapID>

Ian at Somm's Kitchen is a master of wines, wine pairings and presentation. A humble and most generous host, he educates the mind and pampers the palate with his extensive wine knowledge and creative dishes.  If you have not yet had the pleasure of a Somm's Kitchen experience , you are missing out on a memorable evening!</review>

My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience! I highly recommend this intimate dinner setting if you love wine and food. Ian provides seating at the bar for 14 so we were lucky someone cancelled and we were able to fill their spots. Otherwise, you must make a reservation in advance.

Ian is very knowledgable and thoughtful about how specific wines can be paired with the food. This was unlike anything we have ever seen before and were so happy to have had the pleasure of meeting Ian and tasting his passion through each food and wine pairing. We loved that it was an educational evening as he spoke about each wine and the process of each dish presented to us.

It is very clear that Ian has the heart, passion, and knowledge for wine as well as food and it was really great to step into his world for the evening. This is a must-do in Paso Robles and we will definitely be back!</Text>

Ian prepared at least 8 courses paired with 12 to 14 wines. Both the food and wine were incredible. It has an intimate atmosphere, and Ian does a great job explaining both the food and wine, without the pretentious feel that can sometimes come with fine dining. We will definitely be going back. You won't find a better food and wine experience for the money. Somm's is a must stop if you're in Paso!</review><GmapID>0x80ecc567f7e71789:0x931fabd7ab7b7890<//GmapID></record>

<date>1544296940987</date><rate>5<//rate><text>One of the best dinner/meal experiences of a lifetime. Ian has created such a comfortable welcoming environment for an interesting, modern culinary experience for the central coast. Surrounded by strangers, some local, some from afar, all sitting, enjoying, and learning together about wine and the food beautifully plated in front of us. A modern atmosphere for dinner can be intimidating; Ian seamlessly provides a humble setting while serving Michelin-star ingredients. This is top notch for California cuisine. It's so wonderful to watch a chef-somm smile all night as he pours wine into glasses, informing and intriguing his guests about what he truly cares about, course after course. Amazing night, meal, and company! Pictured is a beautiful orange cooked for 12 DAYS!!!!< /text>< pics>

I was blown away by how much fun this restaurant is. Dining at Somm’s Kitchen is like attending a dinner party where you know next to know one but by the end of it you’re making plans and are the best of friends. From the moment you walk in until you leave you feel like a guest in his home. Ian has perfected hospitality.

And all while being chef, maître d’, and sommelier. I know of no where else you can find an experience like Somm’s Kitchen.< /Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Go here. Experience this. Seriously. You’ll regret it if you don’t. We started our weekend in Paso here and it was the best food and wine pairing I’ve ever had. Ian hosts a night of amazing food, great conversation, exceptional wine and best of all it was relaxed and non pretentious. Ian is like a unicorn that I can only dream of becoming...he knows good wine and will tell you all about it (already super impressive) and then he comes out of the kitchen with these incredible dishes that take several days to create and you’re just blown away by it all. A chef and a somm? Could you ask for a better experience? Thanks for hosting us Ian, we’ll be back!< /Review>< username>

This place is insanely good.

Small bites. Wine pairings. And best of all, it is extremely fun.

I cant recommend this place enough. And make reservations. Only 14 seats and one seating per night.< /Review>

Somm's kitchen. Be ready for a unique experience!  This is not a run of the mill restaurant. It's a "By reservation only" you and the Chef experience. Be prepared for quite a few exceptional small bites paired with wine from all over the world. It's not a meal that will set you back a few pounds, but you will be intrigued by the personal attention and care given to each dish. Reservations could be a month out.< /review>

<review>I was fortunate enough to have been accommodated the first night I was in town. The experience was SO good that, being able to get a seat there the next evening was one of the factors weighing into whether or not I was going to book my hotel for another night. The universe was smiling upon me when they could accommodate me again. Trust me when I say that, this place is an immense bargain at $100 per person.

The evening was like a super fun dinner party, and a sense of community was shared with everyone’s mutual love of great wine and food. I don’t think I could pass through Paso again, without stopping here.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80ecc567f7e71789:0x931fabd7ab7b7890</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<user_id>107097788912951200648< /user_id><Text>Last night i celebrated my birthday with an outstanding culinary experience in paso robles.  Somm's Kitchen does an 8 course meal with a custom selected wine pairing from the phenomenal Chef Ian.  There was nothing served that was short of spectacular. The seating is 14 people who you get familiar with as the meal is served over a 3 hour period.  Im a full on foodie and i would say this is the best experience I've had.  This rivals or perhaps eclipses anything you'd fine in any major city.  I'd highly recommend you experience this for yourself (don't let the price deter you it's worth that and more truly loook atw hat they charge for similar culinary adventures in San Francisco and Chicago)!</Text></record></dataset><record>

The night my wife and I stopped here we were lucky. The owner was serving for us. I let him choose our tasting and boy was I pleasantly surprised. He asked a little about what we wanted, then took over from there. By the end our "blind" tasting I was in love with Syrah. Before walking into Somm's Kitchen Syrah was one my least favorite varietals. They know what they are doing and how to do it.

Be prepared. There are only a few seats around the bar. I will go here first the next time we visit.< /review></record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Ian is incredibly knowledgeable on wine and food, but has the ability to cut through the technical terms and give you a fundamental understanding of how to identify the grape and assess them and determine what you like (or don't like)
He calls it BLIC...Balance, Lenght, Intesity, & Complexity...
Not enough space to tell you more but if you are ever in Paso Robles CA you have check him out.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>First time in Paso Robles and happened upon this gem. Amazing Jamon Iberico to start, but the suggested pairing was something I never would have chosen, but unexpected excellence is rare these days and this place delivers. Do think, just communicate your taste and enjoy.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80ecc567f7e71789:0x931fabd7ab7b7890< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Very special. As good wine+food pairings as you will find. Many Old World gems, a few local wines in the mix, Ian is the man. We enjoyed the limited seating around the bar setup, but if you want a table go to Bistro Laurent or Artisan or Il Cortile. Everthing was 5* so challenging to pick a standout. The duck breast comes to mind.<//text>

I love walking into a new situation and not being exactly sure what I'm about to experience.  I love even more walking out thinking I can't WAIT to tell others that they need to experience this, too!

I think if people consider going to Somm's kitchen buying a ticket to an experience instead of paying a bill for dinner they'll get far more out of the ride.

On March 9, my husband and I were visiting Somm's kitchen from Austin, Texas.  We had been in Paso for the first time last year before this restaurant opened, so we were excited to try something new on the square.  We made a reservation about a month before.  When we walked in, Ian told us our spot was at the end of his semi circular bar which had enough room for about 14 people.

Ian greeted us and asked, "Are you hungry?"  We stated we were, and he handed us a glass of a most interesting Austrian sparkling wine.  We had no menu in front of us, wine or otherwise.  There was nothing to suggest what we might be eating, what we might be drinking, how many courses there may be, or even how much things might cost.

I'm sure we could have asked Ian, but we decided we were in for the ride!  For the next two hours we were in his hands as he had us try a local cheese, a foie gras that rivaled that of Michelin starred restaurants, a prime filet, lamb, and on and on...

It seemed some people came and went and didn't stay for the whole ride.  I'm not sure if all the kinks are ironed out there, but it didn't hinder our experience at all.

Each course was served with about a half of a glass of wine...unless of course you drank your wine, then more showed up.  None of the wines were particularly expensive, but all were particularly wonderful and the best paired I've ever had with any food ANYWHERE (and not to get all foodie/wine snobby... but we've been to Picasso, Cyrus, Robuchon... the pairing at Somm's Kitchen was simply AMAZING!)

The whole time we felt as though we were Ian's guests.  He chatted to us about the wines and the food and how he had prepared each thing.  At one point, he stopped and gave us a lesson in wine tasting.  It was taught in such a way that novice and experienced wine aficionados a like could enjoy. Ian is an experienced sommelier who teachers wine classes internationally, so getting a chance to experience this was quite a thrill!

In the French style, Ian prepared a salad between the final course and the desserts.  The salad was so creative.  He peeled the quail eggs and prepared it in front of us.  He carefully cut and placed herbs from right to left and as you ate, the herbs and the flavors increased in intensity with each bite.

We finished with desserts and feeling like we had made friends with our fellow diners and our host.

Our final bill was $250 for the two of us.  Both my husband and I felt this was truly a bargain.  We have paid more for less in the past.

Now, for the "to be completely honest" parts.  I would have liked a menu at least when we left if not to follow at the time.  Ian did say that I could email him and he would send a menu with all the information.  I intend to do that, but it would have been nice to look over it that evening, or even as I was writing this review.

Also, I'm not sure exactly how he decided who got what food.  There was a woman sitting next to me who I ran into twice again in the week while we were there.  Each time I saw her someplace else, she was telling other people that she was upset that she asked for potatoes and didn't get them even though some people did.  She did not like her experience at all and thought Ian was rude.  I thought he was funny and dry.  I liked his sense of humor, but I could see where others might find him off putting.  He's a New Yorker, not a Californian... and he still has some of the edge.

I also heard some complain about the price.   I think ANYWHERE you go 11 courses and 11 half glasses of wine for $125 a person is an amazing bargain... but I understand if you're thinking your'e only going to spend $50 on dinner.. this would be a little rough.</Text>

< Review>
This is a business recommended by a friend, after having them work on my car, I'm so glad I took their advise.
I have had 2 major service jobs done that we're part of the maintence plan for my 10 year old Toyota. The chain that needs replacement at 100,000 miles was quoted at 2 1/2 times higher than Omar charged me. General pre check before a long trip, thorough and no outrageous claims that big bucks for mysterious problems.
I trust Omar, his integrity and honesty makes him one I'll continue to use.< /Review>

I almost gave up my old van because I was getting different diagnoses and quotes from different mechanics -- that was frustrating until I found this place three years ago and I've never gone anywhere else since.  Very honest and reasonable.  They care about you and they're not there to rip you off.   You can put your trust in them 100%.  They're the best!< /text>

< review>
The best quesatacos that I've had in Sacramento. The goat and beef option are both delicious. The food is very authentic, seasoned and flavored very well, & cooked with lots of love. Just have an overflowing amount of flavor that is different from alot of normal Hispanic or Mexican style cooking places. Would highly recommend and will be my new spot. The consume was very delicious and included a spicy container. Tijuana style, connected to a check cashing & gas station. This is your go to place if your looking for tacos< /review>

Just ordered this food for lunch today it was delicious! the goat is to die for great consomme great for people who don't like spicy food they have the broth very plain and you add the level spice you want into it and it's delicious I love spicy. A lot of places only have the beef where should they have both goat and beef and they specialize in it so they don't have many things on the menu and what they do have all work together very well. And very authentic.<//review>

Very rude and disrespectful ladies. I arrived at 9:00am because that’s the time on their google business page. I was very excited to try their tacos because I heard they were good. However, I refuse to spend a cent with a business that don’t appreciate my business. Word of advice, update your hours of operations and treat yours customers better because if they stop coming you won’t have a business.. let that sink in please..<//text>

I like it when places stick to what they are good at, and El Cora Birria is a perfect example of this.  No need to have 10 different meats, they just have beef/res  and goat/chivo, and thats all you need for choices here!

You know you are in for something good, when the parking lot is packed, a 4ft tall speaker (the kind with the flashing lights and a mixer built into the top), thumping away playing corrido songs.  And the taqueria is located inside a gas station/check cashing place.

the tacos were crispy and had a good flavor, I knocked it down one star only due to the fact I like my queso tacos a little cheesier than how they came, but they were still really good, and the green salsa they provided took it to another level.  If Yelp gave a option of a half star this place would be a solid 4.5 instead of a 4.

The consume was delicious, and about 1/4 of the cup was shredded beef on the bottom of it.  we saved ours to finish off later on.  We will 100% be back, I really want to try the mulitas next.<//Text>

Great Food! The owner Chris made the suggestion of what to try as I’ve never never tried Tacos like the ones they have, definitely made the experience that much better when the food is BOMB!< /Text>

<Text>Expensive. I paid over $14 for three tacos. No drinks. No consome. Just three tacos. The quality was fine. Also super uncomfortable. I waited over 20 minutes. Standing up. SUPER loud Banda music. I love loud music - I’m a DJ. But not during lunch. While standing around at a Southside gas station.

Skip this place. It just made me angry. I almost just left  I probably wouldn’t do it again, even for free tacos.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

First off this place is in the back of a gas station and seems totally sketchy but most sketchy places have the best tacos. The Dorado  tacos were worth the 30 min drive and the sketchy gas station. Do yourself a favor and eat here!!</Text>

<Text>Food is delicious don’t get me wrong but the wait was about 45min for 2 tacos and 1 small consome and they are also just a little bit pricey but that’s probably because they’re tiktok famous. The food is great though!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Horrible customer service and food is EXPENSIVE 5 dollars for 1 Birria gas station taco that’s dried I had better birria tacos for lower price. And if they know you they will put your orders before other ppl that had already ordered. So your wait time will be over a hour for a few tacos.</Review>

Male sure you call ahead to make sure they are open. They opened during the week for us as we made an appointment. It was $10 per person cash only so make sure you have it with you.

Overall a great little museum. Amazing selection of rare vintage bikes with little informative tidbits on each bike. Would recommend for any motorcyclists and fans.</Text>

So many bikes with a history written out beside it. The host was great, full of information. This was truly an enjoyable walk thru.

The only downside is the $10 entry fee per person. It really has tons of motorcycles, single owner, but way too expensive for one huge room full of bikes</Text>

Nice private collection. USA, Germany and Japan all represented well. Nice staff that answered all our questions with ease. If you left earlier you'd be there now. A must see in Solvang.<//review>

<Text>Great place and opened up early just for me.  I heard some people complain about the $10 but there are bikes that range  between $100,000 to $500,000 there.  Well worth it if you are a motorcycle and history guy.  Loved it and will gladly throw them another $10 to get in there again.<//Text><response>None</response><time>1539248397677<//time><Rating>4<//Rating><Name>Piyush

Worthy to take a shot. It's a very nice little town. Maybe you can call it a little long street, that would be more accurate. Mostly it's full of visitors and it will be more fun to go there with some friends. Maybe you can go to the Santa Barbara along the way.</review>

<text>I'm giving 1 star because I was there today, a Sunday 9/13/2020 at 10:15am and it was closed. There was no sign on there door indicating they were closed due to Covid 19, nor does there was web sight say anything about being closed. I would have loved to check out the motorcycles. The hours show open at 10am.< /text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Cool place! Had far more motorcycles than I thought it would. Some of the bikes had placards that talked a little about how the bike came to be. I wish all the bikes had a placard with at least  basic info about it.
Still a neat place to visit though. At the time we went it was $10 a person and overall I feel it was money well spent<//Review>

Great bike collection and amazing staff that will tell you about each bike and curious facts. It's totally worth the visit! Don't trust the working hours on Google. In weekdays, you can call them to open the museum.<//review>

Great collection of classic motorcycles with a great mix of personal touches from the owner. I enjoyed reading each of the signs about the bikes. The NSU bikes on display are a must see for anyone interested in vintage racing bikes.</Text>

Private museum a bit pricey to get in but well worth it if you are into motorcycles. Spent over 2 hours here looking at all the different  types of bikes an reading about their history. Everything from original 1st makes to racing. Really a great place to check out.<//Review>

<Review>If you feel $10.00 is too much then you're not a true motorcycle enthusiast. This is the most amazing collection I have ever seen. One-of-a-kinds, about a half dozen Vincents, Matchless, Bartelli, Montesssa. 750 Triples, an old board track racer! And some odd-ball stuff that will leave you scratching your head. Beautiful collection by someone who knows bikes. Very nicely done.</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80e954a0e39e4de9:0xc32641f119e7feaa< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>This is my favorite motorcycle museum second only to Barber in Alabama. They pack a lot of quality in this modestly sized room.

Make sure to check the hours before you go. For a bike nut like me, it's hugely inspiring to see so many beautiful, quirky, vintage bikes. I highly recommend it.<//review><user_id>117417319259273041235<//user_id>< Pictures>

<text>Just so everyone knows they charge $10 a person to come in and look at all the motorcycles. There are so many bikes in there to look at but I feel like the charge is a bit high for only getting to look at them, however we had a blast down memory lane!<//text>< pics>

<Review>Great place and opened up early just for me.  I heard some people complain about the $10 but there are bikes that range  between $100,000 to $500,000 there.  Well worth it if you are a motorcycle and history guy.  Loved it and will gladly throw them another $10 to get in there again.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>By appointment only, but they're easy to get if you call beforehand. Curator will open the museum (a private collection) for as few as ONE PERSON (don't know the maximum). There is a fee -- $10 or $20 per person. ~a hundred or more historically-significant motorcycles, all in running condition</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I think well worth $10!  I spent an exhausting 3+ hours (too many adrenaline rushes?) looking at most everything in the place. In my opinion it is the best quality in one place.  I've seen bigger displays but for a small venue this is a great  collection! The collection varies over time so I plan to revisit next year. Only problem was they are so packed-in in some places that it was hard to get into some corners for a good closeup look at the finer details. The best part is they allow you to get up good and close to see and photo the finer details.  An unusual and pleasant privilege in a museum like this.< /review>

<review>This is the best place to see a wide range of motorcycles. I was there in 2011 and the people are as great as the museum. The bikes were not roped or chained off. You can walk right up to it and get a real good look at the artfully built bikes. He's even got a John Britten motorcycle on display.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Oh my god! Talk about a beautiful motorcycle museum! During the week if you call them (number on the door) they will open the museum doors just for you. I spent a good 40 minutes druling and taking pictures with no one to bug me. Mike opened the place and put on some awesome rock and roll music and waited patiently for me to be done, Thanks Mike! During the weekend they're open from 11 AM to 5pm at 10 bucks per person. If you are in solvang it's a must.<//text>< Pics>

Ten dollar entry fee is not well publicized! We chose not to enter, and wouldn't have driven there if we'd known there was a charge. It's just a room with a bunch of bikes, and the person at the door seemed bored and not at all knowledgeable.< /Review>

For the bargain price of $10.00 you can enter this exclusive museum which houses the private collection of Virgil Elings. This is an expansive collective of fine motorcycles.

Some of the featured items are 1910 FN to the present, and across all makes. Museum is geared toward the racing genre of motorcycles as it is aligned with the particular focus of Virgil and his son Jeff.

A visit to this museum is a delight and is a short trip from Los Angeles area through the drive along the coast to the beautiful Santa Ynez Valley.
Exhibits are diverse and do change as the seasons. Do visit.</review>

OMG, what an amazing collection.  There are about 100 bikes on exhibit and most are very rare with a few important low mileage models thrown in for good measure.  My favorite included the Rennmax, the Militaire, and great collection of Italian and Spanish marques.< /Review>

You had to pay a significant price to enter a small museum, so I declined to do so.</Review>

As a life long (half century and counting) motocycle enthusiast, it's always nice to find gems like this place.  The museum is a bit out of the way and hard to find but DEFINITELY worth it.  The quality of the bikes (BRITTEN, BMW KOMPRESSOR, CROCKER, BROUGH to name a few) was excellent.  The guy at the desk was a bit unique but even he couldn't ruin the excitment.  It would have helped had he known more about the bikes but I was left with the impression he got the job because he must know the owner.  Any more bikes and the museum will need to find more space as it is already way overcrowded with bikes.  To the owner, Sir, you have excellent taste.  Thank you for making your collection available to the masses.<//Review>

You don't think that place can exist. The person who attended us was kind and attentive. Apparently you must make an appointment to arrive. You can take pictures.

<rate>5< /rate><Date>1489665116829< /Date><Text>(Translated by Google) Solvang is located in Santa Barbara County, north of Los Angeles, 130 miles from Los Angeles. In Danish, Solvang means “the field of bathing in the sun”, but Solvang has only nearly 100 years of history. In 1911, several Danish immigrants bought this unremarkable land and built a school to allow their children to receive traditional Danish education while they were engaged in farming. There are more and more Danish immigrants living here, and around this school, this Solvang, which is separated from Denmark, forms an exotic town with a typical Danish style today.
From Los Angeles, all the way to the north through the 101 high-speed, 154 and 246 roads to Solvang. Today, Solvang is already a famous tourist attraction in central California. The residents of the whole town are basically engaged in tourism-related work and have considerable income. It was said that the Danish king visited the United States that year.

(Original)
Solvang位于洛杉矶以北的圣塔芭芭拉县境内，距离洛杉矶130英里。在丹麦语中Solvang的意思是“沐浴在阳光下的田野”，不过Solvang只有近100年的历史。1911年几位丹麦移民买下了这块当时毫不起眼的土地，并在建起了一座学校，为的是让他们的子女在从事耕作之余能够接受传统的丹麦教育。渐渐的居住在这里的丹麦移民也越来越多，围绕着这所学校，这个与丹麦相隔万里的Solvang就形成了今天具有典型丹麦风情的异域小镇。
从洛杉矶出发，一路向北经过101高速、154公路和246公路便到达了Solvang。如今的Solvang已经是加州中部著名的旅游景点，全镇的居民基本从事旅游相关工作，收入可观。话说当年丹麦国王访问美国也曾造访过这里。< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Solvang is Danish, which means "sunny countryside". It is a Danish-style town in the United States created by immigrants from Denmark in the early 20th century through a complete transplant of the Danish architectural style and community planning of their hometown. According to statistics, two-thirds of the permanent population here are of Danish descent. So, if you are in North America, why not fly thousands of miles to Nordic Denmark to reflect Danish style? Just come here. Besides, everyone here understands English. Now it is less than 3 hours from Los Angeles to the Kingdom of Denmark .. In the near future there will be a place for our Chinese ..... Los Angeles --solvamg Welcome!

(Original)
Solvang是丹麦语，意思是“阳光田园”。它是一个由20世纪初期来自丹麦的移民，通过全盘移植故乡丹麦的建筑风格以及社区规划，而创造出来 的一处在美国境内的丹麦风情小镇。据统计，这里三分之二的常驻人口为丹麦后裔。所以说，如果你人在北美洲，何必不远千里飞往北欧丹麦去体现丹麦风情呢? 来这里就可以了。何况在这里，人人都懂英语。现在洛杉矶出发不到3小时就到了这个丹麦王国..不远的将来这里也会有我们华人的一份天地.....洛杉矶--solvamg 欢迎你！< /Review>< user>

<Text>I've never seen so many people trying to make sure that I felt comfortable in the store and the show me what was on sale what was the. Things that were out of stock in when's it going to come back in so I can go there and pick it up. I must say this particular visit the customer service was outstanding detailed and went  some extra time to make sure I understood everything I need to know about the material and what it would do after I bought it and when I tried it sew it. Thanks again for the confident that you showed me that I could do it and how to do it greatly appreciated.< /Text>< Date>

But the store was exceptionally clean the floor plan was well put together parking lot parking lot with clean parking with great throws accessible well planned out store I am I thought<//Text>

<review>In this town there are two places to get your craft supplies Jo-Ann's or hobby lobby. I prefer Jo-Ann's I think they have a better selection and their prices are better. There's absolutely nothing wrong with hobby lobby I just find them a little expensive. I think you'll enjoy the Joanne selection as well.<//review>< userid>

This store has NOTHING for a baby shower...no decorations, nothing to even make decorations...very disappointing! We need to shop local but are literally pushed out of town...go figure!! But i will say...the employee named LOVELY was just that...pleasant and helpful and SMART for her age! They named her right! Thanks for your help today Lovely.< /text>

I'm pretty crafty so I can get my fix by shopping at Joann fabrics. Love all the coupons they offer too. They offer military discounts and you can use multiple coupons at the same time.< /text>

<text>Extremely rude on the phone called to figure out why my debit card was charged twice for one order in store. The women was extremely rude told me there is no returns in the store right now okay what ever but to be extremely rude about taking more money is not understandable. It's my money and I'm out of work cant afford to have my card charged twice and then not even have the items from the second charge so will never be going back to this store. Very shameful the women in the store dont know how to be nice at all even in the store you walk in and they all glare at you as if you shouldn't be in the store. Not welcoming AT ALL!

<Text>Went to pick my online purchase and arrived at Joanns, called for curbside pickup. I was put on hold for a few minutes, all the while looking at the line forming when I decided to hang up and wait in line to pick up my order. It was not so convenient. Once inside, was able to get my supplies with ease and left.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Worst customer service I’ve experienced at any retail store. The elderly self proclaimed supervisor has absolutely no people skills. Her lack of professionalism and rude demeanor are a horrible combination in the customer service industry. The younger “supervisor”  lacks training and has a long way to go before being ready for a leadership position.
I stood in line almost an hr after working 9 hr only to be disrespected and my reason for going not being addressed.. the elderly lady at the door letting people in, never once got up from the chair, didn’t give anyone any information and let  customers stand in line only to find out when they got to the front that they were not taking any returns. There are no signs and the Web site states “hazle free returns “with a Smile”.. That is a lie!!
I gave Joanns another shot and regretted my decision to do so. I will not be returning and have deleted the Joanns App.</Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80db65e3fc49905d:0xcd5b9f95a4e11394</Gmap_id>< review>
Recently Joann fabrics moved from just east of downtown hemet to a new location on the west side of town.  What the reasons for the move are unclear. As the only full service cloth and sewers supply store within the city limits,  they hold the monopoly on the trade.
It may be to a general decline in overall sales as the days of mothers and daughters  sewing together are being replaced by lower cost garments available in the marketplace,  especially available online.
At one time,  women and some men,  relied on commercially available patterns to fabricate that specific piece of clothing that was not readily available in the local market.
Where the sewing machine was once a standard in every well kept home,  this device has been relegated into the hands of the occasional hobbyist.< /review>

Amazing selection of beads, pendants, and charms. They were all half off at the time I went in with the goal to make a dreamcatcher for my girlfriend for our one year, but ended up hand assembling a necklace. Staff helped me find everything I needed, and didn't rush me.<//text>

Never ever go to this JOANN FABRIC AND CRAFTS !!! A Bunch of old ladies working there who don’t know what’s is going on. Petra especially, they are not truthful about their stock and when go get there they state they have had it. RUDE people work their !!! Hope they get shut down like all the others !!!!< /review>

My family and I went shopping for Christmas gifts today. We were there at least a couple of hours. We had some very helpful employees, but the one that really stood out was the cashier, who we will call her "K". K was exceptional. She was courteous, helpful, and very patient; which is unfortunately very rare in customer service anymore.< /Text>

<Text>One of the many perks I enjoy as a retiree are my Exchange privileges. The tax-free shopping, the great assortment of products, price matching, and multiple lanes for a quick checkout is a major plus. You're bound to find a great discount if you're a bargain shopper. 20-50% off in some of the clearance sections of clothing and shoe deals. Another plus the MCX just added was the Gap brand! Happy shopping!<//Text></record>

<text>I don't normal shop at the MCX on Pendleton, but the excellent level of customer service I received from Ms Adeline in jewelry was top notch.
She was knowledgeable, attentive and kind.
It's just about Christmas time and the lines moved quickly. They have a good traffic flow, we were able to socially distance, hand sanitizer was available. It was a good day at the MCX!<//text>< pictures>

I still don't understand why this Nation's Fighting Men and Women have 1 place to go for their and their families needs and everything is overpriced and not discounted. Our Service Men and Women deserve much more.<//Review>

<Text>Coming from 29 Palms after living on base  for 13 years, I was told that the Camp Pendleton location was the biggest store they offer on a Marine Corps base. After shopping there several times, I realised 29 Palms though it may be smaller, has Camp Pendleton MCX beat by MILES. I can never find ANY shoes my size at Pendleton location. Their selection of clothing isn't the best either in my opinion. I don't want to live in 29 Palms again, but I sure wish I could have their MCX back!!<//Text>< response>

<userid>108694162524723688967< /userid><Text>A wide and great selection of name and off brand items. Groceries are limited (commissary is next door though). Plenty of electronics, kitchen supplies, clothes, military apparel and uniforms, a garden/outdoors center, recreation and exercise department, a nice tailor shop and cheap but fast haircut center. Also has a dukin donuts and a frozen yogurt place. It's got it all, would recommend a visit.<//Text><user_name>Nathan Chavez</user_name>< Pictures>

It is an honor any time I visit Camp Pendleton.  Two of my sons served and I was visiting with one of those sons and his family.  The MCX was amazing, fun, a wonderful place to shop.</review>

<Review>Camp Pendleton main PX isn't great. I can't find any clothing there except underpants. I love Brighton handbags, those aren't being restocked.  I drive to Miramar PX and can always find clothing, and too many other things as well.< /Review>< Pics>

I have mixed feelings about this place. Sometimes the employees are nice to you and sometimes they're just rude and not helpful at all. Depends on who are working that day I guess. Overall, it's a good place to shop since everything is cheaper and it's tax-free.</review>

Prices are usually pretty competitive and you don’t have to pay taxes on anything in the store. Every penny spent at any MCX goes right back into the military community where you’re buying from. For instance, if you buy items here, the revenue generated goes back into MCX and Camp Pendleton</Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I am so very disappointed. I took my fam ily to the base to relive some glory days. What did I see walking in front of me. A senior member of the Corps walking in the PX with PT gear on, you can tell this ninja just came from the gym. He walks by a Major, a freaking commissioned Officer! Nothing was said. I had to yell "so we don't correct people and maintain good order and discipline!" Nothing. We walked in right there a sign just like it was 8 years ago when I was active. "Still said No Freaking PT Gear!" I went out of my way to dress my family unit accordingly. Y'all should also.< /review>< pics>

It is a great place to shop if you don't mind that half the items on the shelves are not priced or priced correctly. My last visit some candles priced at 11.99 and a sign that says 25% off so the cost should be 8.99 but when you get to the register was told that the price was 15.99 and discounted to 11.99.  Same item out in town 12.50 each buy two get two free.  The other  great thing is the customer service.  There is a sign for the registers to start the line and wait for the next cashier that is open.  Standing there and notice that they are not using that sign so just get in a line at an open register.  At the "CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK" the women finishes with the customer in front of me and I start to place the items on the counter when she looks at me and as she starts to walk away and says oh this register is closed.</review>

This is the first time I had been to the MCX on this base. I love that it was set up the same pretty much as the base in 29 Palms so I knew where everything was at and all the workers are very very nice. And all the MCX locations I've been to the bathrooms are always very clean and that's important!< /Text>

Used to be a good place to shop in the early 2000's now places out in town are way cheaper than on base.  Shop out in town and save money.< /Text>

It was standard good. We brought our things without waiting but it was on a sunday... and since it was our first visit there, I'm not sure if it was less busy then on a regular work week. The employees there are really nice and help us with our purchase.<//text>

I went looking for something new for spring. Found nothing. Clothes looked terrible. I usely find lots of nice things this time of year. The exchange needs a new buyer. Just pick up some Valentine's candy for gift & a new blender. Nothing else. And I was in tbe mood to buy.
I will be back for Mother's day. Just to check out merchandise. I hope to C new stuff for spring or summer by then.< /review>

Not always fully stocked but fastest service and largest variety as far as MCXs on base. It's more civilian based than the other MCXs but you'll usually find what you need regardless. Always great customer service. Recommend going in the beginning of the week to avoid hectic, highflow hours.</review>

<Text>The worst MCX! Come between the hours of 8am-8pm to find a store with 2 open registers and a line that wraps around the store. But if your looking for something in particular you will find it in the food iles! Only plus is grabbing a protien bar and realizing that you forgot you needed some motto stickers and the message to garcia final edition<//Text>< user_name>

NEVER USE THIS ALTERATION SHOP! just go to "dorthys" right outside the main gate. I gave then a blues coat to get new chevrons. That's it, no alterations, no dry cleaning. They had my jacket for almost a month.  But waited untill the day I was supposed to pick it up to stitch it on that morning. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the hassle.<//Review>

As always treated with respect and courtesy! 1 small request, please make a centralized location where some of retirees can go and buy some of our old unit gear.  Some of us arent authorized into our old work spaces and are proud to have served with some of these units, and proudly want to display their Unit Pride!!  Not a complaint, just a suggestion.<//review>

Sheila and Maryana, at the MCX are excellent professional employees. Sheila the checker and Maryana, who helped get my price check done were great. They deserve recognition for excellent customer service. I truly appreciate all they did.</Text>

This is a good size exchange on Camp Pendleton and has a usual good deals on electronics and some clothing and Jewelry. The best thing is the tax-free status for those that can shop there.<//review>

<review>The staff was helpful in finding what I needed. The store was stocked pretty well also. The onky issue I saw was the checkout line was to the back of the store and it only looked like 1 or 2 registers open. If that is the case there is a register by the GNC store as you go out of the door. This register is for uniform only Mon-Fri, however on the weekends it's fair game and not a lot of people in the other line know.<//review>< UserId.>

I like that I can shop for items and pay less that I would've paid at a department store in a mall. No charge for bag with your purchase and no high taxes on your purchases. The exchange sells brand name clothing for men women and children, shoes, purses, electronics, jewelry, cosmetics and more.<//text>

<review>Horrible experience with this store and their return policy ! My SO got me a pair of boots 3days ago so upon trying them on , noticed a stain that’s prolly they put it in markdown to $86 and unfortunately don’t fit me that well. Went to return today , our floor isn’t carpet and my mistake that didn’t wipe the bottom of it when I tried them on just put straight back to its box.  So told them I tried them on and they keep insisting that it has been worn and disregard my issue. We will never shop in this store again. Their manager and employees has no consideration.</review></record>

When I'm in uniform, and during work hours, there is a registered that is reserved for us. This is fantastic for Marines who on a short time table and have to be back to work quickly especially during holidays when its packed with civilian shoppers.< /review>

<Text>The girls in cosmetics aren't friendly or helpful at all, especially if you aren't inquiring about their Line. They don't offer to help with what you are looking for, their only response is, and I quote "She not here", they turn their backs and go back to talking amongst themselves.< /Text>< Response>
