It’s 10 stars from me!! This dental practice was just amazing from start to finish. As soon as I opened the door, I felt like I was in a spa! It was so stunning and zen. The lady at the desk was so lovely and had a big smile. Jessica the hygienist is amazing. I have been to different hygienists in Ireland and New York, and Jessica was the best I have been to. She was so thorough and gentle, I didn’t feel a thing. Then I was seen by Dr. Meadows, a gentleman!! He did a full examination and again was so gentle and kind. He gave me a run down on everything going on with my teeth and asked had I any concerns. Dr. Meadows was so attentive to any issues I had with my teeth and answered all my questions with a smile. I am back in two weeks for a procedure and I can’t believe I am saying this, but I am actually looking forward to go to the dentist!! I am so happy I found this dental practice.< /Text>

<Text>I can’t say enough great things about Seaside Dental! I visited last week and I immediately felt welcomed. There is a true family and community feel throughout the office.  All employees seemed to love and enjoy their work environment, which says a lot to me. I am planning permanently change to Seaside Dental with, Dr. Meadows and his staff.< /Text>< Pictures>

I had heard great things from a friend about this practice, so when I was going to be in town from LA, I made an appointment to get a second opinion on my broken tooth. Unlike my previous dentist, Dr. Meadows explained his plan and reasoning in full. Their work was quick and painless. Everyone was so friendly and professional and the place was spotless! They also made time for me to do an in-office teeth whitening where I got to kick back and watch TV during the treatment. It was worth the visit to beautiful San Diego to have excellent work done at this amazing practice!<//Review><name>Ashley Harris</name><Rate>5< /Rate>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Meadows was referred to me by a dentist-friend who used to live in the area. I couldn’t believe the level of professionalism and care we received at Seaside Dental. Heather, the hygienist was extremely careful and precise, I didn’t feel a thing! They have advanced technology and the office is beautiful and clean. My husband had some deeper tooth decay and instead of recommending a crown like other dentists, Dr. Meadows used an inlay which is less invasive and more conservative. He’s so thorough and listens to the patients needs and goals. Even the woman who took my pictures, Stephanie was so friendly and welcoming. It’s such a warm atmosphere. After 16 years of searching for a dentist we like and can trust, we’ve finally found one!</text>

Best cleaning of my life! Jessica did an incredible job with my teeth. They have never felt so clean or looked so good! Afterward, Irina took a huge spread of X-rays and photos so that Dr. Meadows could put together a cosmetic plan for me. I’m so excited to get my improved smile. Thanks Seaside Dental. You’re the best!!!<//text>

<user_name>M. Quon< /user_name><text>I had my teeth cleaned by Valerie. She was very through. My teeth haven't felt so clean for a long time. She did an excellent job not only cleaning my  teeth but also gave me suggestions on how I could do a better job. She gave me a brush and a mirror and had me brush areas I was neglecting. Even though she wears gloves while cleaning my teeth she washed her hand several times while getting ready.<//text></record>

My daughter just moved to San Diego and we discovered Seaside from the recommendation of our good friend Abbey Smith who actually works at Seaside and who provided service for Allison. This experience was like no other...My daughter said, she felt like she was in a spa. We are so thankful that we have found a new dentist and we highly recommend them...they truly are the very best!!! Shane Smith<//text>

I have been a patient for more than 20 years and could not be more delighted with my experience.

The staff is incredibly professional, the office is pleasant and bright, and all the equipment is state of the art.

I had extreme anxiety about going to the dentist as a child, but after discovering Seaside Dental I now actually look forward to dental appointments. Everyone on the staff feels like extended family.

I only wish it was possible to give more than five stars!!!!!<//Text>

I’m a long term patient here. I’d hate the thought of trying to find a better one. A better one probably doesn’t exist in San Diego County. From front office to back, the service is fantastic.

Hygienist Valarie is absolutely the best, most conscientious I’ve ever had.<//Text>

The staff here are absolutely wonderful. I spoke with Linda the receptionist and she was more than welcoming and quite frankly a pleasure to speak to. She made scheduling my appointments easy. As for the Dentists; Dr. Mingers and Meadows are fantastic not only in craft but also as people. Dr. Meadows was very professional, personable, and amicable. Dr. Mingers was all of the above and so generous, she helped me out a lot getting my dental work done for the peace corps in a timely manner and is truly a great person. I highly recommend this practice.< /Review>

<Review>I had the best experience I have ever had at the dentist at Seaside! The environment was very quiet and tranquil. I felt very relaxed even just walking in. The hygienist, Brittany, offered me a warm neck pillow and blanket when I got in the dental chair. The neck pillow was extremely delightful! She was quick and thorough with my cleaning. When I got my x-rays done (my LEAST favorite part of dental appointments), Jo was very quick about it, talked me through the whole thing (saying things like, “Only two more to go!), and made me feel very comfortable. Dr. Meadows did a great job walking me through the treatment plan recommended for me. I’ve never had a dental exam this thorough in my life and I feel so great about what is yet to come with my dental treatment. Thank you, Team Seaside for being so lovely and knowledgeable!<//Review>< pictures>

I have been going to Seaside Dental for several years. I had struggled with some anxiety around going to the dentist and I had a hard time finding one who was understanding of that. All of the hygienists and dentists at Seaside are so kind and welcoming and I have not had any anxiety since finding this great group of people. They are also really timely and make sure you are comfortable from the moment you walk in. I highly recommend Seaside Dental!<//text>

< review>
I've been coming to this dental practice for over 35 years.  I began with Dr.  Lange when he was working in this same suite, and I worked for a company located in the same building. Now, at 76 years old, I am truly reaping the benefits. They have always been very professional, have the newest equipment, and the best dentists. Their fees may be on the high side, but you only have one set of teeth, and if you spend a little more to have everything done right, you will save your teeth and the costs associated with big problems down the road. I know, because my husband has always cut corners on his dental care. Now, he is looking at thousands of dollars for implants and various problems with teeth literally falling out from poor dental care from cut-rate dentists.

I have also been very satisfied with all the employees I've met over the years. Linda, at the front counter, has worked there for many years, and is a steady, professional fixture in their office. And Abbey, my personal hygienist, does a great job.  I am so comfortable while getting my teeth cleaned, I feel like I have come for a spa treatment.  Be good to yourself and make use of this beautiful dental practice.<//review>

I have been going to Seaside Dental for 5 years and have been very pleased. Linda at the front desk is always very friendly and helpful. Valerie Hike, the hygienist, is very sweet and gentle. The office always makes sure you're comfortable for your visit, offering a heated neck pillow, blanket, and headphones to watch TV. Dr. Minger is wonderful and I recommend her to everyone looking for a dentist. Two of my friends have started going to Seaside Dental per my referral and both have been very pleased with their experience.</text>

Dr. Meadows and all of the staff from the front office to back are professional, kind, and made me feel like their only patient. Dr. Meadows is working with me to correct a crown that has been replaced twice already with dentists I worked with through my crummy HMO dental insurance. They have the latest technology and know what they’re doing. I tell everyone looking for quality dental care that doesn’t want to deal with rotating dentists anymore to go to Seaside Dental. Dr. Meadows- thank you for your care and attention to my specific dental needs. It’s such a refreshing feeling being listened to and knowing that my dental care is now in the best of hands! 🦷 😁</text>

<Text>I have FINALLY found a dentist that I do not dread visiting: Seaside Dental. I recommend them to all my friends and family, not only because the staff is excellent and genuinely cares about their patients, but also because I feel like my appointments are sort of a mini-vacation from the work week (warm neck roll, cozy blanket and flat screen t.v. to watch while they are working on patients)!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

My husband and I have been going to Seaside Dental for at least 10 years. Over those 10 years the level of customer service, dental work and care has always been exceptional.  Today, Dr. Meadows fixed my chipped front tooth. It looks perfect.</Review>

<Review>The staff at Seaside Dental have gone above and beyond to take care of me in a desperate time! I called in minor frantics with an issue with an existing crown. They got me in within 10 minutes, greeted me at the door with a smile, delivered an exceptional experience, and did a truly great job with my dental issues. The office is clean, beautiful, equipped with the latest technology, and you can tell by the way that the staff interacts that they are all knowledgeable and highly qualified. I will without question be returning for regular dental work in the future. Thank you again, Seaside Dental, for supporting me in my desperate hour :)

Update: I went back for my second cleaning, and after following their prescribed behavior & product changes, I can happily report that for the first time in YEARS I walked out with ZERO cavities & no need to schedule a follow up appointment. Such a happy moment thanks to the professionalism & expertise of the team at Seaside Dental. Beyond thankful for them!</Review>< pics>

<text>Dr. Kim and the Seaside Dental staff are incredible!  I just moved from PA and was referred to Dr. Kim by another doctor. I have had facial pain for over 10 years and Dr. Kim is very determined to find me relief.  He has already put me in touch with 2 others specialists and checks in with me over the phone when I don't have an appointment.  All the staff is always so pleasant and extremely accommodating.  I love going to Seaside Dental!</text>< Rating>

<review>I've been a patient at Seaside Dental for 37 years and would not dream of going anywhere else for dental care.  The staff is very friendly and very professional.  They go out of their way to keep you comfortable during any procedure.  The office is immaculate and equipped with the latest technology.  The care always feels personal, as there are only a few patients being seen at any given time, unlike some huge practices that have an assembly-line feel.  Can't recommend Seaside Dental enough.  It is well worth the drive from Encinitas, where I live, to La Jolla.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Seaside dental is like going to a spa!
They make you so comfortable you love going to your dentist.
A warm neck roll and a blanket makes you relaxed and cozy.
Dr Minger is so sweet and very professional. She has an expert eye and expert hands.
Dr Minger is very skilled at cosmetic dental bonding.
She made my front teeth even and beautiful with gum laser, and built on my front teeth with resin bonding to make them even and straight.
It looks like veneers and I get so much compliments.
I also had Dr Minger plan Invisalign for me and she is able to go beyond your expectations with how good your smile can look!
Not just straitening my teeth but also widen my smile. Amazing!
You can’t get these results from just ordering trays online. If you want professional blow you mind results, you have to see an expert dentist.
I’ve been a patient for years and I love everything about this office.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc06ceecff1bdb:0xda408a524dd05076<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Be prepared
•Left lane is the regular line if you have four bins and up.
• Right lane is express four bins and below. If it is open.

1.Get your blue bin at the front, it stack up
2. Be prepared to separate your plastic and aluminum before getting in line. No bags

They have cleaning stations with soap at the end of the office building. They have sanitizer at the cashier.

The guys working are very kind and hard working.
Parking is minimal.

It's a good half an hour if you already have everything separated. I like that it's open on Sunday.< /Review>

<review>I know I was seriously underpaid last time there, I could see the guy pulling my plastic ticket before the other guy finished weighing my total count. Short about $10 compared to other recycling centers. Been avoiding this one. Never will come back, now.<//review>< Pics>

Parking situation is bad be prepared to get stuck getting in and out of parking area. The process is easy, grab blue bins and separate recycling take you 5 bins or less at a time on line get a receipt then get your money at the booth.<//text>

<Review>For a first timer, it's fairly confusing - as recycling centers typically are. Small parking lot often overloaded, which if it backs up, leaves absolutely no way to queue in an organized way. Lot has only one combined entrance/exit which gets clogged by disorganized queueing.

Once you find a spot, you get out and look around for signs explaining what to do... See a long line of blue barrels... That's it? Look around for a blue barrel that hopefully someone hasn't laid claim to (there's a stash of "new" blue barrels but it's not clearly marked and often obscured by cars), then dump your stuff in there and... block the driveway while standing in a line, confused as the only visible sign is "express lane - 5 or less", but it appears closed (but even its closed-ness isn't clearly shown).

Recycling is one of those things I would have expected to be better over the years, not to have reached an all-time low for bad experience in 2020. CRV is long overdue for a revamp. Should be handled by machines. Today is the worst experience I ever had with recycling (after first visiting another center 5 miles away where I couldn't even stop the car, as there was no place to queue nor park).

The place is nice, clean, and runs quickly. The cashier doesn't try talking to you over the sound of crashing cans and bottles. That's nice. The process was quite quick once I managed to get to the front of the line with my one half-full barrel of crushed cans. And for my hour-and-a-half of driving and hassle, I came away $12.50 richer :)<//Review><Time>1593722391218<//Time></record></dataset><record>

I am usually a simple girl, I take my coffee black. I thought let’s try something new, a floral whatever. I was being adventurous- so I asked the staff for their advice and they bashed their own drink to the point that it made it not appealing. They were unable to describe/recommend their beverages and I was sort of turned off after that.< /Review>

I have been coming to this location at least 4 days a week for about 9 months and get the same drink and the Baristas(same 2)never look at me with any recognition or have ever used my name despite asking me for it daily. Probably one of the reasons Starbucks across the street is so much busier. Coffee Bean's coffee is better though so I guess I'm willing to sacrifice service.</Review>

Great drinks. Wish they had a back door for easy access from the back parking lot or even a drive thru. Usually busy and sometimes the lobby is dirty at high peak times do to rude patrons who leave their dishes behind.< /Text>

This location is awesome! I come here to work at least 3 times a week and the atmosphere is very relaxed and you get great service. I've always had great experiences at all coffee beans, and this location is not the exception. I enjoy it better than any other coffee shops. Love it!!!<//review>

This is the place where we have a wonderful cup of coffee at least once a  day whenever we visit the wonderful town of Palm Springs. Perfect to sit down and look at people passing by or comming in for a cup.
Any type of coffee you chose you can rely on that it is tasteful and worth every cent. Really nice staff!
Just go there!< /text>

This place puts Starbucks to shame. Their coffee is far superior and absolutely delicious. My favorite drink is the Mocha Latte with an extra shot of espresso to really give it a kick. It's great hot or cold or even blended.<//Text>

Had to go ask twice about it and my frappuccino had been in the counter for a while already melting. We were missing a latte which they said we did not order but we had paid for it. They never gave us a receipt and we didn't ask for one (mistake on my end) thinking it was ok since when they read the order it was fine and I gave my name to pick up the order. The supervisor on site was rude and not helpful. She did not want to give us our latte and said we had to pay again. When I asked if they could locate our order with the card I had paid with, they gave us what seemed like our medium size latte. When we go to sit down it was a regular black coffee. On top of that, the other employees and supervisor kept looking at us and talking to what seemed to be about us. Very dissapointed at their attitude and how they handled their mistake. Also, the restrooms were not very clean and had a bad smell. To be in the downtown palms springs I was expecting a more friendly environment to tourists.<//review></record>

I wish I could give them negative stars. Brought my toddler in to use the restroom for an emergency bathroom situation and was told it was for customers only. So I had to buy something and then proceed to clean the soiled pants of an extremely embarrassed little boy. Where is the human decency? I will be advising everyone I know in the area not to waste their money at an establishment that would condone this kind of treatment.< /Review>

<review>My order took a long time and they never called me. I had to go and ask for it myself. The staff was rude and said I didn' t pay for that. They didn't give me the receipt, so I had no proof. Then after a lot of arguing they gave a regular cofee to me and it was not what I order. Finally the staff was looking and talking bad things about me.<//review><user_name>Tatiana Furtado</user_name><resp>{'time': 1562704590393, 'text': "Tatiana, we're sorry to hear about your experience, and hope that you'll be willing to speak with us directly about this visit.

Horrible customer service! I would rather spend the extra money for coffee I would not enjoy at Starbucks than ever coming here again. Whether or not you were having a bad day your job is to make your customers happy. I went in with my family and I was not the only one to make a comment of how cruel your employees were. You need a better training program or something to update the requirements for hire. Please do people the favor, thanks! ;D< /Text>

Good coffee, their beans are roasted well, their service is very good and the atmosphere is perfect for when you need to get your pick up and work at the same time.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) We do not recommend eating here, the taste is not bad, we had a few coffees and two muffins, but within 1 hour of having had breakfast we have all started to feel stomachaches.

No aconsejamos comer aquí, el sabor no está mal, tomamos unos cafés y dos muffin, pero al cabo de 1 hora de haber desayunado todos hemos empezado a sentir dolor de estómago.</text>

< Review>
Truly disappointing, I would give it no stars if I had a chance. My family and I just moved and were in search of a dog. We found a beautiful younger wired haired terrier in need of a home and immediately jumped on. After contacting Paws we were told that the dog was still available and we can come check him out. Today my parents went to go look at him in the morning. HE WAS THE BEST!!! We immediately fell in love with him more than we loved him in pictures. He was very energetic and super smart. We were told that the dog would be ours and the other applications would be thrown away. This evening we get an email that the dog needs to put under behavioral training and they were no longer interested in looking for a new home for him. This is seriously so screwed up, why would bother to play with our emotions. They knew that we were ready for the challenge, WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE GETTING OURSELVES INTO. We knew he needed training because his is still a young dog. We even said we would pay for professional training but they said no. We just don't get why they don't want a loving sweet family to expand. Let me know if this has happened to you!< /Review>

<Text>Small but nice facility. They care very much for the animals others abandon on the island and do their best to ensure each adoption is right for the dog or cat and the family. Our pup is turning into a wonder member of the family.<//Text>< response>

Paws is the best! I found a sweet, senior dog over by the landing with no collar. I was able to drop the dog off on a Sunday morning and within an hour I had a voicemail from Paws saying they located the owner through the chip in the dog and they were on their way. great work!< /review>

Beautiful animals. Caring volunteers. I volunteer when I have the time and I adopted my cat from here. Hes such a sweet baby. Plenty of loving dogs and cats that need a home. Stop by and find your companion!!</text>

As far as animal shelters go, this one's one of the best smelling ones I've been to. I know it takes a lot to do this job, but it is very much appreciated that I don't have to hold my breath or breathe through my shirt collar/sleeve when looking for a fur baby. The staff is helpful and knowledge of the animals in their care, but if things don't work out, you're given a two week window to return the pet and get a the adoption fee refunded.<//text>

Really nice facility but not alot of options to adopt. This facility spends all it's money making it look fancy but it could definitely hold many other dogs. When I went there was only three dogs and cats plus even a turtle had the same size room as a full grown dog. Again really nice area in coronado but could potentially save more stray dogs if they wanted to< /text>

<Review>We have adopted two cats from PAWS and always enjoy working with the people at this location.  We are lucky to have a place like this right here in Coronado that does so much to find good homes for so many cats and dogs who need them.  I encourage anyone looking for a cat or dog to stop by this facility and take a look around.  They have dogs and cats of all ages.  The SD Humane Society also has a beautiful facility over on Gaines in SD that is worth a visit as well.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

This is one of the best organized and run Animal Care Facility in the country and should be an example for all shelters. The dogs each have separate rooms, NOT Cages, with windows for fresh air and a view!   They have daily outdoor playtime in the fenced play yards and are walked at least twice a day.  They are socialized so well that, when they are considered by a family to adopt, they are happy and well behaved and present beautifully. I know many people who have adopted from PAWS of Coronado and are very pleased with their new family members. The cats have large rooms, again no cages, with ladders and towers for climbing,  and lots of toys.  They are handled many times a day by a wonderful group of volunteers who socialize them and get them ready to fit right into their new adoptive homes. They are driven around the Landing in baby Prams so that they are available to be seen by potential adopters.   If you are looking for a great new family member to adopt, call for KAREN DWINELL, the outstanding adoption coordinator.  Pets bring so much joy into our lives and rescued ones bring even more!!< /Review>

<text>My girlfriend and I have been looking for a pet for a while.  Saw a cat we really liked, went home and thought about it then came back the next day to get more information about her.  The first day a curly haired lady was very sweet to us... But the second day the front lady (leaner brunette) must hate her flipping job as she was pretty rude right away with condescending remarks about how only serious people can pet the animals.  (We had JUST let her know that's why we returned today to see this one specific cat.) She left and as much as we didn't want to, had to go get her to help us. Again more of the worst customer service on the planet.  We let her know we wanted to meet the cat and just wanted to play with her first. The lady then needed to go in the back to ask something.  My girlfriend and I were left bewildered why an animal shelter won't let us give this cat a good home.  Do we not look like decent people? She came back with the most ridiculous stretch of an answer... it's bonded to one so you have to take them both.  Its only 6 months old... how does that make sense!? She can bond with my super mellow cat and have a great life.  She dismissed us and went back to doing nothing at the counter without so much as a conciliatory remark or goodbye. Anywho, I try and be forgiving and understanding but this lady clearly should not have to deal with the general public. What person makes you feel bad for trying to adopt a pet!?  We're an average 30 year old, successful couple and this lady is acting like we're diseased, homeless, drug addicts.  We really want to adopt little dipstick still, but if I have to deal with that lady again, I doubt I'll have as soft of words to say. Worst experience ever.<//text>< rate>

I have always had a great experience here! I can get bad callus on my heels due to wearing sandals all the time and they do a great job. My nails are always the shape and length I want them!<//review>

I've been getting my nails done for 3 years now and never have I had such a bad experience. I went in for a gel set and it ended up being $40 which I don't mind paying if the work is good however that wasn't the case here. I pulled away from the nail tech so many times because she kept cutting me and burning my fingers with the dremal. At one point she filed too much of my nail and told me to relax my fingers, like it was my fault she kept hurting me. She cut me 5 times! When she was done i showed her where there was still some polish on my finger and instead of reaching for the acetone she grabbed a nail file, and Filed. My. Finger. My nails are not the same length, they aren't filed properly, my cuticles look like garbage and I still have polish on my fingers. I'm only giving this place 2 stars because they have an incredible selection of colors and the salon is clean.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I always have a great experience when I go.  I don't have a preference when it comes to getting a pedicure because they all do a great job.  I recently moved about 1/2 hour away, but I continue going back, because Nathan does a fantastic job with my manicures.  I've been getting manicures done on and off for years and his work is by far the best I've ever had.  My nails are gorgeous, they never come off and I get compliments on them all the time!< /Text>< user>

Waited 1/2 hr. for service to start although I had an appt. Got new nail set and pedicure. Had to do touch ups myself on nails and pedicure was uninspiring (I like a good foot rub with the scrub). Ho hum.<//Text>

They sanitize sets and unseal them in front of you. No one else in the area does this! Also very clean! My favorite salon by far in the area !<//Text>

Have gotten a pedicure twice and both times liquid was put on my feet to soften them and it burned holes through my skin.  Staff has a real problem communicating in English</text>

Lacking consistency.  Did a ok job on me but my husband got rushed and didnt receive half the attention i did.  We paid the same price...should have received the same service (minus the polish..lol).</review>

<Review>I've been here a few times and it has been hit and miss. There is one girl who does a really good job, she doesn't speak English hardly at all, and is very young looking, but really does a great job. Aside from her, there is a guy that does it, same guy that is always there and he is mediocre. He's a middle aged asian guy, probably early thirties. Just okay. They also have a new girl, she is hispanic, very young, mid twenties maybe. She did my pedicure and I was just okay with it. Not much attention to detail. There is also an older asian lady who does a good job as well. So of the 4 workers that I have seen, as long as you get either the young asian lady or the older asian lady, you'll be in great hands. Aside from that... Maybe you should wait until one of them is available.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I just enjoy their food. I always get excellent customer service here. The place is neat and the cashiers are always very friendly. Will come back again.</Review>

It is certainly much better here than any other dining commons that I've been to. The Berkeley food is kind of nasty and has no options compared to Carrillo. I did not like their pork loin, though.

As a UCSB undergraduate living at Manzanita Village, I fully appreciate the effort they put into the food here. Very tasty, wood fired pizza, as well as an excellent salad bar. Friendly workers there as well.<//text>

Wow, how this place has changed since I attended UCSB in the 90s!  There are soooo many choices and the food is really good.  I couldn't believe how many cooks are involved now, and they even have a "real" chef plus lots of student workers who make sure everything is stocked and cleaned.  I want to go back to college because of this dining common.< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>The food is really good, clean, tasty and fresh. I loved the experience. However, the place is organized somewhat haphazardly. For instance, oatmeal and toppings are very far away from each other, drinks are located far away from all other kinds of food, etc.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80e93f6bff47ea07:0x46b1087666350078</Gmap_id>< Time>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>This is a great buffet for students to bring their parents and friends too. There are always people here and it can get quite busy, but that's all just a testament to how great the food is. Don't get me wrong, this isn't gourmet style foods, but for a UC, Santa Barbara really knows how to serve it up. The food is prepared right in front of you and comes with a great flavor, cultural diversity, and freshness you usually get from home cooked meals. I love coming here.< /text>< pics>

<review>This place is great! There's tons of options to choose from that accommodates different dietary needs and some stuff is just plain good. There is also good variety. Today for lunch we could have anything from chicken shwarma to pizza to salad to cheeseburgers. It's just awesome.</review>< pics>

Probably the best tasting dinning commons out of the four available here. With that being said the food is a hit or miss. For 12 bucks a meal, you can probably get more bang for your buck elsewhere< /Review>

<Text>I lived in Manzi for 2 years and ate at Carrillo constantly. The food is really good, but it got old after several years which is to be expected for literally any restaurant. So many memories here, so many good times.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Eating here is not difficult, because you will not find anything that tastes good, but because you find too much that tastes good and you can not decide.

(Original)
Hier ist essen nicht schwierig, weil man nichts findet was einem schmeckt, sondern weil man zu viel findet was einem schmeckt, und man sich nicht entscheiden kann.< /text>

<GmapID>0x80db7f2d26df191d:0x2077a29132aec605< /GmapID><Text>Briar Rose winery was magic 🌟

For Labor Day weekend, I wanted to get away somewhere I hadn’t been before, but was in a short driving distance. I did some googling and found Snow White’s cottage. I am a HUGE original Disney fan (things from Walt’s time), so I knew I had to visit.

When we arrived, even the parking lot had a view. You had a gorgeous view of all the vineyards below you, and Briar Rose itself was covered from the outside with this whimsical type of bush. You enter the bush and all of a sudden, you find yourself in Snow White’s garden, surrounded by her cute squirrel friends, wishing well, and her seven dwarves.

The original quaint cottage was built in the 1970’s by Disney imagineer Beldon Fields. While working for Disney, Beldon collected bits and pieces of Disney artifacts which made their way into the cottage. Some tiles from Mr. Toads, a rock from Indiana Jones, and a lantern from Haunted Mansion make the grounds so much more special.

Beauty aside, the wine tasting is delicious. We started out with a wonderful cracker and homemade cheese kit while we waited on our wine. We got one red wine tasting, and one white wine tasting before ordering a couple extra glasses to enjoy the scenery a bit longer.

I cannot recommend Briar Rose enough! Delicious wine, knowledgeable staff, and a view to die for. I’ll be coming back to Temecula just to enjoy the winery. 🍷

<Text>We had such a lovely time here. The grounds are beautiful and photo worthy. The staff are very prompt and friendly. My favorite was their rose wine. The rest was a bit too acidic for me. And they have a cat on the grounds- so sweet. It’s very quiet and hidden away, and I love the Disney theme.</Text>< Resp>

<Review>I visited Briar Rose Winery with friends on my trip to Southern California last week. We couldn't have better experience! From the minute we walked in the doors, the owner Dorian and her staff welcomed us with big smiles and was excellent in serving truly wonderful tasty wines with implementing safety COVID-19 guidelines.
I can't wait to come back!</Review>< Date>

<Text>I loved the experience here, great atmosphere, music, breeze and landscape. The birds calling during early spring... Similar to a Disney landscape movie set. The wines now... Lovely selection for low budget or sophisticated palettes, reds and white... There is an owner's favorite, blended types and much more. Great service personnel. Nice walk around the property. *Amateur wine comments*< /Text>< pictures>

<user>113060025517917819155<//user><Text>The place is super cute, very fairy tale. Make sure you make reservations because they get busy. This was our least favorite winery from the day. We went to 3 others. Probably could have skipped this one. Some reds were a little cloudy/murky in color. Also taste was a little dull. Not sure if that’s what they were going for. Service was also slow and only one pourer.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSZ6xUf2ki6eAWICRHGV7ddRq76ehMxUeoAj3b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPygKDU84JFfTp0GifVEVPvEJ7E_OHT68qTQTLe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzrbA0FdyZgRj7x78McTrltsL-qnJWWpsPZyDZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIKJ0oV8p5D8FPmLfMyq-TSz2DeDWJ9BJuGDOL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWq1YAmdgaLnMWsMPNNTWP7900DnQFp5mO4-71=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures></record>

This place is lovely! My husband and I went here for our anniversary weekend and loved it. The owner, Dorian, is so kind, gracious, and serving. She is passionate about her vineyard and very accommodating to guests. This is the place to go if you are looking for some great wine, less crowds, and a privately owned/non corporate experience.< /Review>

<Review>What a sweet find in Temecula. If you're ever in town, make reservations for a tasting and GO!

1. They make their own wine. 2. It's the cutest little cottage, straight from Disney (I kid you not), 3. good selection of wines

The vineyard is extremely friendly, hugs all around when we were there. There are many locals / regulars that are there as well, which is a good sign. Definitely a spot to check out<//Review>< user>

There was a large group inside so we sat outside.  The server was aloof and did not tell us anything about the wines other than the varietal being poured.  They had some of the WORST wine I have ever had.  Usually I can find at least 1 or 2 wines I like, but not here.  So many better wineries in the area, do not waste your time here.<//review>< pics>

I love this place and the people there!! The wine is fantastic. And the selection of wines they have are delicious, by far the best I've had!! The members are a great crowd I feel like I'm home when I'm at briar rose. Brandon and Stacy are the best they make the whole experience a great and relaxing time. It is truly the best Winery I have ever been to. So if you're looking for a place to relax and be around awesome people this is the place for you!!!<//Text>

This is a premier family winery with bold creations by the junior owner, Les Linkogle. The senior owner and wife of Les, Dorie Lonkogle, is a saint. The wines are amazing and the setting is magical with a Disney theme depicting Snow White. Be sure to call the manager, Stacy, for reservations to taste wines. Your tasting host, Brandon, will give you an animated d and informative presentation.< /text>

It's very cute and definitely tries to be Disney themed. The staff is young and happy to tell you about their wines but they generally leave you alone. You can take your wine to walk around the grounds, which are scenic. The tastings include 5 whites or 6 reds which are good. There was an aged cab that was impressive, but the rest were ok. All local California blends or varieties.</text>

Some of the worst wines I have ever had. They made us pay more for a wine tour and the lady that served us didn’t even know the first thing about any of the wines she served us. We paid a lot to be there and she thought that Pinot Blanc was a blend between Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Grigio. It was and it should have been embarrassing for the winery for the fact that they had someone working their tasting room who knew nothing about wine at all.  Honestly, if that is your job and you are pouring only a handful of wines all day, you should at least know what you are doing.  I had to tell her that Pinot Blanc is it's own varietal and she had to go look it up to confirm. Boo!< /review>

Our server was Eric. Learned few things while tasting their wines. Why red wine is red? Because of the processing technique: the grape skin is added while the wines is fermenting. That's what gives it a red color. This is also why the red wines have more beneficial properties. Unlike white wines that are processed without grape skin.
Why storing red wine bottles horizontally ? The red wine bottles should be laid flat so that sediment from the wine settles evenly on one side and the cork is submerged to the wine which keeps it moist. Dry corks will make your wine bitter.
Very interesting. It was my first ever experience with wine tasting. The place is quiet and green with roses and old house. I like that seats are outdoor under the trees shade. The only thing was not so pleasant is experience with hostess. Not friendly at all.< /review>

<Review>Friendly people and animals.  Every time I go, the winery cat Patches seems to make an appearance.  I also met their dog this last visit.  Great big bold red wines and a beautiful environment that is built as though you are on the set of a Disney Princess movie.

Loved hearing the stories about the history of Briar Rose Winery! We enjoyed tastings from the Standard list and they were awesome.  We’ll be back to taste the Premium list soon!< /review>

<Response>None</Response><review>I just tried to make a reservation here today for my cousin's 30th birthday and the receptionist was very belittling! She talked to me like I had no idea how to make a reservation when I asked simple questions about their winery! I told her that I was going to go with a different winery and she said, "that's fine, bye" and hung up on me! She did not seem to care about customer service. If that is how this winery treats their customers over the phone I am sure glad I am not going to experience how they treat their customers when they arrive. Such a shame because it seems like such a nice place!</review>< pictures>

Briar Rose is one of my favorite wineries -- in California and elsewhere.  It's a small, intimate setting, with helpful, informative staff who aren't at all pushy with their wines.  They don't have to be; they're pretty awesome -- especially the reds.  My favorite:  the 2012 Pinot Noir.  OMG!!!</Review>

<Text>The portion served was ridiculous...
Almost nothing.   Was told that a few days prior to our visit, amounts of wine to be served was cut down  a lot.   I've never been served one drink's worth per tasting.  Very disappointing.</Text></record>

Thanks to Stacey, Briar rose Winery has become our favorite wine  stop while in Temecula. We have done tastings at many of the wineries in Temecula but it was the warm welcome and pleasant experiences at Briar Rose ,coupled with wines we liked, that caused us to become Wine Club members here. Our favorites are the Viognier and their Cabernet Franc. While reservations are required because it is in a residential neighborhood, a quick phone call or email is all that it takes ; Stacey responds promptly.< /text>

<UserId.>106660689015618577627<//UserId.><Review>Purchased the Groupon, but our server, Brandon, was super cool, giving us double shot tastings. The venue is super cutesie having the same name as Disney's Snow White, "Briar Rose".

If you look hard enough you may find all 7 of the dwarves hiding around the premises. Like Easter Eggs.

It's a small and intimate venue, a great setting for a party of 4-6, but romantic enough for two. The outdoor seating was in beautiful gardens with a variety of sculptures.

We purchased the "Talking Frog" for my cousin and ended up finishing 2 bottles. An interesting wine with some Hefeweizen, flavoring it like a beer.</Review><user_name>Jaznotes1<//user_name>< pictures>

A great place if you just turned 21 and want to show up in a limo and don't care about the quality of wine you drink or the level of service that you receive.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!

VERY condescending staff and you NEED a reservation just to taste their subpar wine. Come on people. No wonder nobody was there unless they had a groupon. Not even worth it with the groupon, trust me, there are so many other great wineries to try.<//review>

Service is horrible rude inattentive workers.  I bought a wine tasting Groupon for this establishment and made a reservation for12:30 the next day, we drove out to Temecula (hour drive from my house). Got there  at 12:00 hostess watched us  Walk into front lobby didn't say hello or anything or even utter a word,  we stood around and waited in there for 10 mins no one came in to greet us. We walked out  and sat on  chairs out front and waited another 15min hostess walked by several times no smile no greetings just ignore us. I brought up Groupon on my phone and cancelled my order promptly, we walked out still none of the hostesses cared or  said a word,  the whole time we were there we witnessed not one once hospitality we ended going to another winery and had a good time.  fyi if the owner cares we bought 3 bottles of wine there< /Text>

I loved the show and what they are doing!! Absolutely 100%
But........ when I looked in their website at the cost of not only their services but their PRODUCTS as well... I knew that this is for the wealthy only... I am not poor but the cost is mind blowing and I was deeply saddened by this.. it’s a shame... so many good dogs won’t get this training. Just think about all the people that were forced to put their pets down because they couldn’t afford thousands of dollars for medical bills. This is training that saves lives. Lives of creatures that are so under appreciated in this world.< /text>
<pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1618420216564, 'text': "Some of our packages can cost quite a bit because we often board and train dogs for extended periods of time and train one-on-one with experienced professional trainers. We do have an affordable dog training option...our Online Dog Training Course, which isn't expensive. If you practice as directed for 15 minutes once or twice a day religiously, you can definitely train your dog on the Cali K9 obedience system in just a few weeks. Most of our collars, leashes, and training tugs are inexpensive. The training box we use can be built at home."}< /resp>< GmapID>

<Text>I have a beautiful 6yr old doggie called 'Mobberley' but being a mini schnauzer he can be very very stubborn so we watched Cali K9 and now with our motto "Always training" he is slowly and surely listening more😁😁😁😁😁Thank you Cali K9 for a fabulous and inspirational show and awesome training techniques✨✨✨✨✨✨✨< /Text>< Pics>

I have learned so much in such a short amount of time! I really needed the training as Luna is my first puppy. I grew up with a family dog but having a puppy on my own is a very different experience. So glad I found CaliK9 and took my Luna to 1:1 training. CaliK9s group classes are great too and they offer different levels of group classes. The group training is helping me to learn how to engage my pup even when there are distractions around. Can't wait to keep learning more and I'm sure I will rely on CaliK9 for any future training needs as they offer plenty of options and refreshers as your pup grows up.< /text>

Trainers and staff are amazing, patient, talented and loving! The dedication they have to these animals is incredible! They take the time to train not only the dog but the human as well! Thank God for all their hard work and dedication to saving dogs that would otherwise be discarded.<//text>

Can I leave a review just based on what I've seen with your Netflix show? I mean WOW! Jas is AMAZING! I'm in Houston, TX and our pooch is well mannered but to a fault. He's definitely not a guard dog. He loves EVERYONE. What can we do to ensure he'll alert us of strangers or intruders?<//review>

Your vision and commitment are truly making a difference in not only dogs, but humans as well.  Your story is a beautiful.  I own two dogs and you've inspired me to train more and maintain leader of the pack.</Text>< rating>

I’ve tried to call the store no answer I placed an email no response I purchased the $227 kit which I was extremely excited for but I only received two items and I’m missing tote , treat bag ,bandana , slip lead, long line leash, tug toy, and reward ball. It’s been 2 days since I’ve received just the training box and touch pad. I still have no track of my other items definitely a scam and I’m looking to return just the two items I received because everything else is missing. DO NOT PURCHASE NO ONE HAS REACHED OUT TO ME VERY BAD SERVICE!< /review>< pictures>

Just when I felt like I had no idea what left to do or if I was doing the right thing with everyone in the family your show came on Netflix.  It gives me hope and has given me great tips on how to help Chase.  He is a pit mixed w malinois.  He is fearful aggressive and very protective over me even w my kids. I have alot of work to do.  To bad we are in st louis and not California.   ( not that I could afford those prices 🤣 Thank you for sharing your storys and giving us hope.</review>

<text>It's good, but a little bit hyped IMO. I think it's very distinctive at the personal protection level, but for everyday type of training- it's solid- but not stellar. Again, IMO.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>CaliK9 is a great facility and Jas has a good team of trainers (himself included obviously) that pretty much takes care of everything. I had purchased the 20/20 training package for my German Shepherd that I initially trained myself from when I got him at 11 weeks up until about 3years of age when I took him in to go with some more advanced work to certify him as a service dog and protection dog, and it's definitely worth it! Jas does great work and I really enjoyed the training, to be honest though they're not really just training your dog, they're training you to train your dog  and its all based on the dogs behavior, which is great is a pretty great tactic and it teaches you to understand your dog's behavior. My  the only reason I give 4 stars is because I feel his admin team should be more organized and stay top of tracking records or the emails they send out. I haven't finished all my training sessions nor have I heard back in over a year, but I also haven't followed up on a count of being very busy myself (bad excuse I know but life happens). Either way, if you consider wanting to get professional training, Jas has a long line of very credible work and has even trained dogs for some very famous celebrities and athlete's. I'm also very thankful for his guidance with my K9. And I'm long overdue for refreshers lol.</text>< UserId.>

<Text>My dog was leash reactive (but otherwise sweet and smart) but her behavior is now well under control after a package of 1:1 and group classes. Now she goes to daycamp and truly loves the obedience and agility work. Her favorite thing on Earth (aside from roast beef) is going to "canine school" for the day. She hasn't had any adverse reaction to other dogs since beginning her training (which we found were based totally out of fear) and is perfectly pleasant on busy streets and loud, chaotic situations. The instructors are total pros.</Text>< gmapID>

<Text>I've been bringing Marvin to Cali K9 for almost a year now, and he has come a long way. From a giant , rambunctious puppy, to a giant teenage dog, he's becoming a very good canine citizen.

I take advantage of all of CaliK9's available resources. I try to get Marvin in for daycamp with Frenchy at least once a week, we have a private session whenever time permits, we go to a weekly group class and i have booked Marvin for boarding when i am out of town.

The boarding here at CaliK9 is top notch. It's sad to leave your dog for 3+ days, but i have peace of mind knowing he's with the people that have trained him. He's going to get proper care while I'm gone and that makes me so happy.

You can see how much everyone at CaliK9 cares about their clients and i am so glad to be a part of this CaliK9 family.< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pictures>

<Review>It's been an awesome experience working with Cali K9 so far, we've done two private lessons with Justin and our golden retriever and couldn't be happier with the level of service we've gotten. Justin has been amazing, and we're seeing significant improvement in our puppy!

Only con I can think of is that it's difficult managing your schedule and getting a hold of them on the phone if you call their main line.

UPDATE (2018): Justin has left Cali K9 and imo he was the highlight there, we ended up not using our full package because he left.</Review><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

If you're looking for serious dog training, look no further. Winston, our Doberman Pinscher has been trained here for two years now after another training school in Sacramento gave him anxiety and fear based aggression.

Jas (the founder/owner) is passionate about Cali K9, and it shows. Everybody who works there is exceptional and we cannot recommend them enough. Winston will be moving on to protection training next year, and we could have never done it without Cali K9.</Review>

In 2011, I was a veteran dog owner, but a real dog training novice when I decided to train my elderly pit bull at Cali K9's occasional weekend classes in the Oakland Hills and Fremont. I quickly discovered there's a lot more to it than the standard "sit, stay, down" drill. Jas and his team trained me, not just my dog. And I also earned from watching other dog owners interact with their dogs in such a balanced way.

It was up to me to practice the training techniques I learned and use them consistently. This experience changed what became my last weeks with my 15-year-old best friend. Sadly, she was slowly dying of cancer and I eventually had to put her down. Around that time, I was home alone and was caught up in a scary armed home invasion robbery, which cemented my decision to re-evaluate and beef up my home security and get another canine companion.

A client of California K9 Solutions knew about a young Doberman rescue dog that needed a forever home. He was big, beautiful and friendly, but completely untrained and "all over the place". At the time, it was impossible for me to walk him down the street. Cali K9 trained me and my 95 lb. wild teenager at their facility in San Jose so I could take him anywhere. The 15 minutes of practice once or twice a day paid off and now I'm able to walk him off leash and feel confident he'll listen to me. In addition, he's turned into an amazing security dog, so I feel totally safe in my home and neighborhood. This whole experience turned into one of the best things that's ever happened to me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Jas and company!< /review>

Practical & effective! We've been training with CaliK9 for over year. Our dog is highly socialized--we can take him anywhere and be with any dog & any situation.  Thank you Jas & CaliK9! There is no better dog training organization in the Bay Area.</review>

(Translated by Google) Saw it on Netflix and used the training box on my dog. The training is really fun and has had an effect after a short time. Also a super sympathetic trainer.

Every member of the Law Offices of Vondra & Hanna is professional, polite, understanding, and knowledgeable. Both Kathleen Butler and Diana Frey always made themselves available to answer any questions that I had, responding to emails and phone calls promptly. They truly care about their clients and I highly recommend them to anyone seeking counsel with worker’s compensation.< /text>

When you think I'm an attorney most of the time you revert back to what it's like on a television show but in reality it's hard to find someone who actually will listen to you. I reviewed these attorneys and asked other attorneys if they had to go up against someone who do they not want to go up against and it was this firm. It's hard to find these days when you've got all these attorneys on TV and everything saying that they'll fight for you but sometimes it's good to find a local attorney that will fight for you and I feel that this law firm will do exactly that. So please give them a try and at least ask questions they will answer them and if they can't I know they'll find somebody within their law firm that can. That's been my experience and I look forward if they can help me in my case and if not it doesn't matter , there are Great law firm just to talk to because they respect veterans like me and they respect you no matter what the injury may be they'll be there to help you. Thank you and that is my review.< /Text>

I called today and spoke with Mr. Phil Vondra over an auto insurance matter and Mr. Vondra was extremely patient and helpful with every question I had. I was upset with my auto insurance company and he was able to counsel me on my next plan of action and how to handle the situation. Both him and the receptionist were professional.<//review>

I am very thankful that I was referred to Vondra and Hanna for help with my Worker’s Comp issue and particularly Kathleen Butler.  Understanding how busy attorneys are from working in a legal field myself, I was amazed that she called me back the same day of my initial inquiry.  She is so well informed and knowledgeable in the area and offered suggestions and information on procedures that I had no idea existed.  She is very easy to talk to and actually listens, allowing me to open up and speak freely about the specifics of my case. She  is honest and straight-forward, consistent with concerns in follow-up emails.  I was really reticent about consulting an attorney about my situation, but she made me feel comfortable.  I would highly recommend Vondra and Hanna and specifically Kathleen for legal advice that is well-reasoned, knowledgeable, and caring.</text>

I would like to post a very complimentary review to the Law Offices of Vondra & Hanna and to Kathleen Butler, Attorney at Law. I was in a quandary over my Workman’s Comp case and lacked the knowledge necessary to render a proper decision.  That is where Kathleen Butler, Attorney at Law, stepped in to render the information necessary to make an accurate assessment of the situation.  Attorney Kathleen Butler is very knowledgeable, experienced, and dedicated.  I was very impressed with Attorney Kathleen Butler and her professional abilities regarding workman’s compensation cases.  If you are looking for a professional, responsive, and knowledgeable attorney to provide legal assistance for your workman’s compensation claim contact Attorney Kathleen Butler and the Law Offices of Vondra & Hanna.  I highly recommend this attorney and law office to obtain the highest quality of legal representation.< /text>

<review>I knew that I've made the right decision when I called the Law Office of Vondra and Hanna to ask this office to handle my Workers' Compensation case. Attorneys, Ms. Butler and Mr. Hanna and Diana, paralegal were all very professional, diligent, and always responded promptly to my questions/concerns. Especially Diana, she always took time to explain things thoroughly and made sure you understood the materials/documents presented. She is just awesome!

The Law Office of Vondra and Hanna was great throughout my case and provided an outstanding results for my Workers' Compensation case. If you are in need of a good Workers' Compensation attorney that will take care of your needs diligently and help maximize your settlement, don't hesitate to give this office a call.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>Phil represented me in a severe accident in 2007 in which I was hit by a drunk driver and had severe injuries and a drawn out recovery. Phil fought for me tooth-and-nail and was communicative, empathetic, and tenacious throughout the entire legal process. He took the time to help me understand the legal complexities in which I had no experience, and made sure that no stone was unturned. I was blessed to have him as my representative at a very difficult and challenging point in my life, and I would never hesitate to utilize his services again, or recommend him to a friend or family member. His whole team was always a blessing in my life at a time of great need!<//Review>< response>

This office went above and beyond more than I expected. Very professional, yet very personable. When my mom passed away they where very thoughtful and sent a beautiful card. They remained attentive and kept me in the loop at all times regarding my case. I highly recommend Vondra and Hanna.</text>

This company is just amazing with my husband and I.  We had not retained them, and I called for advice. We were really struggling with how to handle my husbands injury. The staff took our calls, we NEVER got the "we will call you back" regular stuff that you get from so many attorneys offices. When I needed to call back to clarify something that I was told, they knew EXACTLY what I had discussed with them in prior calls without me having to reiterate my story ALL OVER AGAIN. Just an amazing group of people. When the time comes, this is who we want on our side! Thank you.</text>

My daughter passed away in a car accident 1 1/2 years ago as a passenger. I didn't know if I needed to have a lawyer as a new situation came  up leaving me wondering. They got Mr Vondra on the phone immediately to discuss the matter. I was so blown away on his honesty. It's hard to find that now days in many different businesses. I highly recommend this office! Thank you so much!< /review>

<Review>This is an top rated law firm. Mr. Hanna was professional and extremely polite. Diana  was on top of everything for 2 years, She kept me informed throughout the complete processes. I've had previous experience with lawyers an I can't remember anyone doing their job as well as she does. I would recommend this law firm to anyone. They do what they tell you and get the job done right. Thank you, Ron H.<//Review><rate>5<//rate></record>

Everyone in the office was helpful and professional.  Phil Vondra was very sympathetic to my mother. Just a wonderful man. Then there is Stacey, always there when I needed her, emailed back in no time, always on our side and not for the money, just because she is that kind of person. I can't say enough about how wonderful she is. Stacey made a difficult situation bearable. I'm so glad I chose this firm to represent my mother.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>This is to knowledge The law offices of Vondra & Hanna,
Because of the staff of this outstanding law firm and their true follow-up with all the unseen delays because of the Covid-19 that has slowed up and changed the court calendars, they were still able to successfully find a conclusion and settlement to handle my unusual case. I've been blessed and was led to seek out a company with moral values to make good a bad situation. MY hat is off to Philip Vondra and his wonderful staff for keeping me informed and keeping it true. I am in debt to their professionalism and bringing this case to a successful close. I've been to the moon and back with an insurance I won't mention the company, concerning a claim for a foreign object in their clients product in the food business. This insurance company was trying to do the switch and bait and was trying to push it out so far that I was settled for something embarrassing low that was more of a nuisance than a properly compensated claim. If it wasn't for this firm of Vondra & Hanna to see through and bring this to a successful end, I never thought I would get there, but they did and now I find not enough adjectives to describe my delight with the outcome.
Again, I take my head off and referrals and recommendations are coming your way soon for others needing a professional and legal team for advice and direction. Keep up the good fight.

<review>From day one nothing but positive vibes from everyone in the office. They truly care about your feelings and your state of being. Diana always kept me informed with everything and was on top
Of everything. Every time I had a question she would get to me the same day. Gina was so lovely and caring.robert and phill truly care about their clients and are amazing people outside from being lawyers. I truly believe they care for you as a person and not just a client, they definitely respect your feelings. Honestly I couldn’t have picked a better team to handle my case. Definitely would recommend 10/10!!!!<//review><user_name>ceciy avila< /user_name>< gmapID>

<text>Being from AZ visiting Phelan and involved in a vehicle accident on the I-15 where a Semi & car hit me totaling my Silverado with Injury to my Shoulder I took a chance On Vondra & Hanna attorney firm.  I found them to be excellent in returning my E-mails and phone calls when I had a question. They kept me updated at all times and were friendly not all business. The work they did and what they had to work with I give them a AAA+ rating. Phill & Stacey are good people and the rest of the office people are also. I was very surprised how well they worked on my case. If you need a good attorney this is the one you should check out 1st.  Thank You Vondra & Hanna I know you worked hard on this.<//text>< Pictures>

Kimberly and Diana are so rude- consistently over the phone and total opposite of helpful.

As for Mr.Hannah he was nice but what did you actually do on my behalf....I don't want to like ruin his rep or nothing, I just sharing my experience.

I went for help and was told to wait. I needed someone to advocate for me (a legal someone) and this was a total fail. I had to do all the hard work (while disabled).

Now I am worse.

Total WASTE of time.

CAREFUL seeking help here.< /text>

I hired me Hanna for a work comp case. I had to find a new attorney because after almost a year. I was starting to get so frustrated!!!
I had no idea what process I was at. I had to call to get any information regarding my case.
I would call to talk to the attorney and the woman that aswers the phone was always very rude to me. Every time I wanted to talk to Mr Hannah I would have to make a appointment for a phone conference. Witch was usually 3-4 days after my call .
I know work comp is a night mare. They did nothing to try to get back over $ 1,000 maybe more of percriptions that work comp refuse to cover.
My final straw was I had my phone conference at witch time I told Hannah about my concerns.he rudly interuinter me saying well if you're not happy with my service you can just find a new attorney. I feel they were a waist of my time.</review>

Phil and his team are great to work with, they are knowledgeable and experienced. When we have matters in Victorville area, Phil Vondra is our go-to-local-attorney, highly recommended!</review>

Called to get information regarding my case, left a message and did not get a response.  Called back today and the receptionist told me the lawyer was too busy to get back to me.  The receptionist continued to be rude and I told her I was going over to talk with the lawyer and report her, she said OOOOO I am shaking in my chair, we don't want your business anyway.<//Text>

<text>Nothing but junk, some things would be salvageable if not outrageously expensive.  Who ever is in charge of pricing items there is out of their mind. They also refuse to sell a complete item, rather you must purchase each piece separately. Imagine finding a dresser and being charged for each drawer separately even if they obviously go together. So much potential for a great salvage shop wasted by poor merchandising and incompetence, habitat for humanity has lost my support.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Random but unique items you can use depending on the special project needs.

It's unique items make the hunt that much more ..... Unique.... Just the walk around alone will have you daydreaming of the new project possibilities.

Prices are a bit wild. But for good cause and the unique typically unable to find items you should have no problem saying yes I want that< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Great selection at this location, varies like most restores but great for cabinet doors, vanities, doors, bed frames, and patio furniture. Staff are always very informative, helpful, and friendly. My personal favorite in IE.</text>

The pricing makes no sense smaller versions of the same item will be priced higher the crossed out prices on big ticket items indicate a too high initial price. The Ontario location is less expensive and usually has more to offer. Addendum, well the random pricing has been fixed. Now everything is just expensive, I mean like near retail for used items. I had a hard time finding anything I thought was a deal and almost everything except small items started at $10.</Text>

I’m a real estate investor who ends up walking the store at least a few times a month depending on the kinds of jobs I’m doing.  You never know what they’ll have in and what treasure you’ll find. If you’re super handy and creative, there are some real deals here. Please remember proceeds go to charity and I have never come here and not find a deal. Some of the stuff has breaks, scratches, or has some wear and tear. That’s why the deals. I’m reading some very strange reviews here that don’t seem to understand what this is. Attached is a picture of the vanity that I purchased for a rehab. Great quality with the handles included and way nicer than I would have gotten at home repair store for similar quality. This worked out really great in the master bathroom and will try to remember to repost when it’s all complete with counter.</Text>

Bad management and high prices, sometimes more than the thing was new.  Managers will not budge on prices when proven to be unreasonable or quoted a lower price then change their mind.  But some decent sales? I keep going back but leave irritated almost every time.</Text>

<text>This place has Goodwill quality merchandise but they are charging Pier 1 prices. Rickety tables for $200, other basic furniture for $700, and decorations with (no joke) the Goodwill price tag still attached being sold for a higher price. Might be a good stop for building materials, but not furniture.<//text><user_id>112719795946674260284<//user_id>< Rating>

Not the greatest deals I had heard of.  Someone told me they had unbelievable deals on just about everything related to construction.  The only things I found to be good deals were damaged blemished items.  Everything else was slightly lower than normal retail.  Some of the materials were ever higher than some retailers.< /text>

I first think 4 stars is a rating to be proud of, but can understand that you want to always strive for 5. On three different times in your store I was interested in items that were not priced. One was a wood trim quarter circle about 7 feet in length, item #2 was a box set CD country music, and the 3 was most recent dryer ducting. All 3 times I could not buy the items most recently was told they could call me about the price which never happened. Okay nbd, you guys are busy...I asked where or if I could donate some very old but new in boxes light fixtures and about a 100 padlocks with keys, the manager told me yeah leave it at the back, I went shopping first and when I went to drop it the door was 3\4 shut , the manager I'm guessing at lunch...and no one to ask for a receipt. The worst thing though was one time after shopping I thought I had left my card at home. I'm searching and the girl as I'm running to my car asks the manager something like can we let her come back....he says oh no, not her. . ..I'm a little taken aback, return from my car with my card...and he's standing with the checkout girl showing her something on his tablet, I'm assuming my Yelp review. Soooo, that explains why he's dissmissive and aloof ...and it explains why I avoid him at all costs. I still love the store= I just think maybe if the manager would stop hating me for my honest opinion.. .then 5 stars would be warranted.<//Text>

<Review>This place is horrible. Just browsing through and everything is marked up 10x’s what you would see in a thrift store or consignment. Example: leather couch with literally no leather on it for 799$. Broken chair with only 3 legs 49.99$. I was trying to keep from laughing...... it was unbelievable 😂< /Review>< pics>

Not the selection recently, and prices have been getting higher. They had a patio bench with severe damage for a hair more than what I found it for at a retail location. Disappointed.</text>

We are so sorry your visit was not satisfying, we’d greatly appreciate the opportunity to improve your impression. We understand your concern about some of our price points, we do our sincere best to put out a quality product at a price that is good for the customer and good for the mission driven work we’re tasked with raising funds for. Our prices are based on Habitat for Humanity International standards and are 30%-90% off the retail price, with additional discounts offered each week. Feel free to drop a comment in our comment box if you ever see something that is overpriced. It is against our policy to change prices once items are out on the sales floor, but if we find the item to be overpriced, we will pull the item from the sales floor, re-price it, then return it to the sales floor (please note that this process may take several days.)

This park is a great little pit stop on the way to or coming back from the beach. It is just off the pier at the top of the stairs down to the sand. It wasn't crowded at all, on the weekday, in the AM that me and my guys went. I don't want to give away my secrets, but early is optimal at most places.

The cement slide that runs parallel to the stairs is a great addition.<//Text>

Such a beautiful place at night and this sign is awesome! Loved the playground area which is wonderful for little kids and older ones as well. The slide down to the sand was very cool! Love how shops and delicious dining options are conveniently located close to the beach. Can't wait to visit again. 🌞< /text>

So beautiful here!  You must come by & walk the pier then dip your toes in the ocean.  Plenty of places to eat & they have open bathrooms.  Also playgrounds nearby.  No dogs or skateboarding allowed on the pier.  You do pay $5 for parking.</Review>

Always a great time when in Pismo.  Had fish & chips  at the Quarter Deck food was delicious,  waitresses was awesome! Went and got a cinnamon roll and that was wonderful(cream cheese and walnuts) Took a long walk around Dinosaur Park in Shell Beach  very peaceful and relaxing. Great for kids. The pier was also a nice walk. Had a hotdogs for lunch on the pier that was nice.<//review>

<review>This is such a fun beach and town. I visited while passing through on a road trip and am so glad I did! It’s definitely worth the stop.

The pier is a must walk, as it offers some GORGEOUS views! The town offers so much charm- people out and about with their kids and/or dogs just enjoying life. It’s fun to be out and about! There’s a free parking lot within walkable distance to the beach, as well as a pay to park lot. Amble restrooms are available. If your dates are flexible I would advise visiting during the weekday, as the weekend is PACKED!!!!! but regardless of what day you visit, you’re in for a good time.<//review><time>1611645255167</time><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVobKOq1HrVRSoEb4z8iAaI7Hqe33_gjVgWO0k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXUgGCArXYfjH1vPkvhUnwMd-pYjdRn6NWlGdi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_UFYZGVB0MFjGbAbaRFsjVnwMGRQXPjalf2q9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6f0vnoirsaTjFe7a3lDjqg2C7otjF85Hw2BV7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUfmBcHpVBDfghA-GirbFLdZUJ_2BbXGNn40Tn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Review>What a great place to visit! Definitely go at night. There are less crowds and the people are friendlier as you walk along the beach or on to the pier. The city did a great job with the pier and beachfront walk. Take your children for a stroll. It is an inexpensive memory that they will cherish for a long time!</Review><user_id>100457496253834713950</user_id>< user_name>

I love the pier, even the new design with the kids park love it.  Only thing I see wrong are a good amount of people without masks on, coronavirus era for future reference, and there little trailers they give it a nice touch but some of the things they sell are a little pricey.  But $5 for an hour parking? Ridiculous! Get your money done other way the duck?<//review>

Beautiful beach,town is getting more up scale with choices of hotels and dining...pier area dressed up recently, but over all not much to do there overall.
We used to stay in our RVing days
At a 5stars, nat'l awarding RVPark just at Southern part of Pismo Beach called Pismo Beach Coast RVPark.  Cleanest and numerous great facilities, pool, mini golf. Walk to pier...etc .  It's right at the beach too!< /Text>

Lots of great photo opts at the pier and lots of dining choices. Signs are posted saying masks are required but there's a mix bag if people actually following those rules.< /Review>

Such a small town feel,  we stayed at Pismo Coast Village it's specifically for RV's and you are allowed a tent at your RV site. Family friendly and Dog friendly town.< /Review>

4.5 stars only due to weather but thanks to the new renovations and construction it's much better they made new pismo beach letters for the sign added 2 new slides and play area next to the pier for the kids and a lil farther past the pier they have swings so it's gotten a lot better since I was a kid</Text>

Pismo Beach didn't disappoint me. Actually, it never has. I'm the happiest when I'm near the ocean. Surprisingly there's lots of shops and outside dining available. The pier has been refurbished and fishing is once again allowed. Masks are required on the pier although only about half of the people were wearing them. It was a nice warm sunny day. If you've never been or haven't been in a while you owe yourself a visit.< /review>

<Text>The beach was great! Exactly how a person would imagine a beach to be; amazingly soothing sand(great exfoliation on the feet), and waves crashing to shore. People surfing and a long peer to walk out on, and even a rescue crew in their little hut. There's plenty of room to do whatever you want,  but there's not a convenient place to park; you have to just get lucky and find one somewhere in the neighborhood. It was alot cleaner than I thought it would be too.</Text>< Pics>

Pismo is always a good getaway or place for international travelers to visit. Most food places are good.  The main thing to check reviews on would be the hotels.  Some can be really good and other really bad.</text>

I've been coming here since before I was 6' tall and that's a long time ago.  Anyways, it's the ideal central coast locale to relax and hit up beachy shoppy shops.  Pismo is my favourite of the Five Cities and that's all you needed to know.</review>

Great family friendly beach town. At low tide you can drive your car on the beach and enjoy a night time bonfire. Cocktails at the Dea Venture for sunset is a must.</review>

Popped open a couple of beers, and soaked up some sun. You could walk a pretty far distance on the sandy beach to get to the water. It was so much nicer and warmer than northern Cali beaches are for chilling.<//text>< Pics>

My home! Late fall and early winter are the best months for weather and there's hardly anyone here! Cool small town feel still even with all the new hotels going up. Worth the trip from anywhere.< /Review>

I always have a good time in Pismo! There is so much to do here. You can take your 4-wheelers out to the dunes, relax on the beach, grab a bite at the many amazing restaurants, or fish off the pier. It's hard to be bored in Pismo Beach!</Review>

<Text>We stop at this beach whenever we're driving to LA. Its a beautiful beach with good scenic views. Not very crowded. Can get quite chilly.  Couple of good eateries around the pier. You might also see some tiny sea creatures on the beach when the tide is low. We spotted some sand dollars.</Text>< pics>

A colorful town with a beautiful beach and pier..The ATV rides at the beach are totally worth trying (It's better to pre-book them as they sell out fast) Also, be sure to check out the Pismo Beach Outlet mall.<//Review>

Awful  , terrible,  after  the beach returned to a $ 80 parking ticket out of nowhere, no signs posted  , what a dirty trick, what a scam  , cars everywhere with tickets on them,  ruined our day,  I will NEVER  come back to Pismo,  Moro Bay and other places  are  so much nicer</Review>

< review>
Pismo Beach is a wonderful Mediterranean weathered place to visit! There are many hidden beaches that one may enjoy with few if any other people around. There are a variety of wineries to also visit along with some waterfalls that you can swim at and Lake Lopez where you can camp and wakeboard. Kayaking is also very beautiful with some caves that you can go through at Shell Beach. Don't miss the many miles of sand dunes that you can wander through south of Oceano. It is a wonderful place to see a beautiful sunset dropping into the blue jeweled Waters. Having lived here for 30 years I have been fortunate enough to experience all of the area's Many Wonders and would be happy to help others to find some of these secret places! Have you ever heard of the Dunites? They were an incredible people living in the Dunes that had a tremendous effect on the twentieth century yet no one knows about them anymore. Find out more on Instagram: @the_dunites_Utopia.</review>

Pismo Beach. A laid back beach town with some excellent restaurants and bars. Beautiful beach and boardwalk which acts as a nice foreground for Sunrises and Sunsets.< /text>

<text>This is a great place for shopping, eating, and sitting on the beach. Something that I prefer not to do is go swimming in the beach here because it’s too cold. There is a nearby beach that is warmer called Avila Beach which is only 10 minutes of a drive.<//text></record>

What can I say beautiful place to live I get to run on the beach every day through the dunes to the estuary and then run in the water.
Very dog friendly lots of birds lots of really cool shells in Sand dollars.. Easy to sit the whole day reading a book or chilling with the family.. And if you go right down the street you can actually ride quads and dune buggies</review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Nice, family friendly beach. Water was ok in December... Warm enough for some people to swim in (if you have a high tolerance for cold water). This beach is also a popular place for surfing, and there is a shop that sells surfer gear close by. The beach is clean, beautiful and long. There are several hotels close by and so many restaurants within walking distance. Parking can be a bit of a hassle the closer you get to the beach front, especially at popular times in the year.</Review>< Response>

< review>
I love Pismo Beach, and I've been coming here since before I could walk. Now with stores, restraunts, and parking being open the feel is like an escape to pre-COVID times. They're currently renovating the whole area surrounding the pier (new bathrooms, a park, slides down to the beach, tables, cornhole, etc.) And their new additions look amazing. They finally reopened parking near Wooly's at the end of Pomeroy which really helps with the flow of traffic. The beach is always clean, and it's a great place to hang out with friends, family, pets, or just go for a peaceful walk on your own. The one drawback is the sheer amount of people who smoke marijuana while walking down the street or on the beach; you literally can not escape the smell if you're anywhere near large groups of people. Otherwise it's great, and I'll definitely be back soon.< /review>

All my friends and colleagues planned to spend a day at Pismo Beach and it was worth it. We really enjoyed the time here. Beach is very clean and is not so crowded if you are not next to pier. Water is soo clean here and there are a couple of swings for kids to enjoy and we luckily did not have to keep watch of kids they enjoyed swinging and the beach itself. The only thing which was bad was the restrooms but for a holiday season I guess it is how all the places are.< /Text>

Alder said once it is completed, the hotel will feature a restaurant, pool and event lawn with fire pits and other amenities.

"It's very much a Central Coast beach cottage style," he said. "We didn't look to import Los Angeles to Pismo Beach. Obviously, we like Pismo Beach a lot. It should be a really nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the major cities -- or the heat of the Central Valley, if that's what you're concerned about."

The hotel is expected to open in April or May 2019, Alder said.

"It's taken us a while to get going, but we're really excited," he said. "It's going to be very high-quality."<//review>

<Review>Loved the beautiful houses before the beach and the nice people. We were shooting some pictures of a newlywed couple and we had many cars and all the residents of one of the streets let us use their front yards to park our cars.
First time in this beach and I love it. Water was clean.</Review>< Pictures>

Nice white sand beach with lots of eateries close by. Slightly touristy but not overwhelming. A great balance. Seems to have some surfing options. Town has a reasonable amount of street parking available.< /Text>

Watched the Gray whales from the boardwalk, walked the old Town shops and are at Mos, the best BBQ in Pismo. A nice way to spend an afternoon at the beach. It will be nice when the pier is finally done.</Text>

<Review>I live down in Los Angeles but would never miss a trip up here with my family every summer. Gorgeous blue water and soft golden sand, with fun rocks to climb on and public activities on one side of the beach, to a quiet and mellow walk on the other. The waves are amazing and I love boogie-boarding in the ocean, no way would I stay down in LA to go surfing. The locals are so friendly, and to top it all off it has that old beach town vibe with buildings that haven't been renovated and modernized like the beaches near me.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ec58dd2114a2bb:0x9e91d036f9dc6e<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful beach, pretty spacious. Scenic and obviously crowded during the summer and extended holidays. The water never warms up though -- not that it should, because global warming -- but just a heads up.</Review>

This is a great beach to walk around and dig for clams. One of the only beaches that you can drive your car on. You can walk out in the ocean a long way it will be only up to your knees because it is so flat.</Text>

I was there last Friday and it was perfect timing.  I found immediate parking, didn't have an hours wait to eat at Brad's Restaurant and the best part was that the beach wasn't over crowded as it usually is.  This is why I gave Pismo 5 stars for that day.  It reminded me of what it once was.<//review>

<Review>Early morning dolphins and whales were very active.  The whales were jumping out of the water making huge splashes,  and some of the dolphins were actually riding the waves. It was the most spectacular site to see.  The beaches are clean and run for miles ready for families to enjoy.  The beaches are also frequently patrolled by police and life guards which really makes it feel safe.<//Review></record>

Beautiful beach to stop by between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Not busy at all, but offers breath-taking views and almost unlimited access to sun and sand.</review>

I just love the atmosphere of this place. whether you're downtown or at the beach it is relaxing and brings the feel of a small town. The food options are great as well as entertainment. Bowling and playing pool are some of my favorites!<//text>

I enjoyed the beach but missed the old style environment before the huge hotel. I hope the building stop before Pismo becomes another tourist attraction.<//Text>

<Text>It's a beautiful and really long beach. You can take your dogs there and just enjoy the clear sky, soft & warm sand and the beautiful coast. On this beach it is allowed to drive your car which makes for an amazing experience. Words can't capture the beauty, so make sure to go there in person</Text>< Pics>

I learned to skim board and surf here. This town is the heart of California beach culture. Fun shops. Happy people. Good eats and cheap drinks. Some of the best days of my life were spent in this town.

If you've never visited, make a point to do so. You won't regret it.< /Text>

Great place that holds great memories from childhood. Looks like they have taken on some new structures and facilities as well as pier repair and improvent. Should prove to be even more accommodating one these new buildings are up and running.</Review>

I first it was like "wow the beach", however after a few trips I see that its just an overly expensive place with nothing else to do. You can go to any crappy restaurant in the Valley, yetyou will eat better.< /review>

<text>Very nice, hip scene, with easy access to beach and hotel recommend to book in advance especially on holidays this place can fill quickly but even then nothing to long of a wait or to far to walk too.. beach is clean considering the amount of ppl there on any giving day.. pier is under construction but not too much was on the old pier the plans of the new one look great can't wait til it's up and running<//text>< Pics>

<text>How in the heck can you review a hotel that is not even open??? I live in Pismo. Total pre-opening hype marketing. I’m certain it will be lovely and all the things claimed but folks, it’s NOT OPEN! Shaking my head at all these crazy reviews. Are you reviewing Pismo Beach? Must have some super kind of foreknowledge as to how it’s going to actually be. People IZ crazy!!</text></record>

The surf and turf was amazing and I rarely order lobster because I am always disappointed. The Hokkaido scallops were to die for and the apple crostata dessert topped with house made Vanilla bean and thyme ice cream was a nice surprise. The creme brulee was so silky.  I only wish I lived closer.<//text>

Like this beach, but don't love it. It lacks the sanitation of other California beaches and it feels less secure. I was recently there with my family all day and did not once see a lifeguard, police officers, or any emergency responders. The water tends to be very cold and there is often seaweed and other debris all over the sand.< /Review>

How are there 818 reviews when the hotel isn’t even open yet? Staying next door and watching the construction as I type this.</Review>

Pismo and Avila are probably my two favorite beaches in this area. The parking is kind of a mess in both areas when it is busy.</Review>

How does a hotel that hasn't even been built yet come up with 750 5-⭐ reviews?
Hate deceptive advertising!
They haven't even finished pouring the slab for the underground parking garage yet...you should at least wait until you're open to post fake reviews.< /text>

< Review>
Google highjacked my review of Pismo and put it on a hotel that doesn't exist, well it's still under construction as of 3/16/19. WTH???~~~~Love Pismo Beach. They need more restrooms/porta potties and garbage cans on the south end of the actual beach  though to make it easier for folks to do the right thing. Parking is very limited and will only get worse when the two new large hotels are completed. Traffic can be a nightmare in the summer and holiday weekends.  Locals give it up to the tourists during those times.</Review>

Room's ok. Unfortunately the floor in this Motel 6 and( in Santa Rosa ) floors are really dirty. And there's no refrigerator in the room, so request one when you book your room.</Text>

Hit my first Cali waves on that beach . Nooooooo sleeping in cars in the parking lot.  Great place to busk or share art.. Was a great place to set anchor ie (parking break) for a few days and enjoy times and memories that you will never forget.  Sometimes if ya hit at just the right time or season there was a guy who gives free surfing lessions and surfboard loaning . If u see him u will know its him. Dont be scared he wont bite ... Well possibly so bring peace offerimg or just say hello ..</text>

Bad place to visit. Small conservative Beach town filled with ghetto classes people. No fun activities to do here except spend money to stay at a hotel for a subpar beach. Very bad please don't go here. Go to santa Cruz or los osos or Long Beach or stay home.<//Text>

A good base camp if you want to explore the local wineries. But the town itself is boring.</review>

There were some weird plankton or something in the water that kept biting me which was so annoying, so I could not go in the water.

I have been visiting Pismo since I can remember. This last visit was OK. The pier being under construction makes the street more crowded and with rude visitors that come, bringing all the trash they can carry. It was once the best beach to visit in California,  but us tourists come, trash it, then leave! That seems to make the people who live and work here much more irritated by our presents. The best thing is the fact they opened all the streets to access the beach. Making it more "spread out" between the beach access. Thank you, to the folks that put up with us. I appreciate you</Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Photos disputed for the postcard! Tip: go early as there is almost no one! And as the grandmothers say "Don't forget to take the" cardigan ", because it sells a lot, even in the sun!

(Original)
Fotos disputadas para o  cartão postal! Dica: vá cedo, pois não tem quase ninguém! E como dizem as vovós " Não esqueça de levar o "casaquinho", pois venta muito, mesmo com sol!<//Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) It is a long beach with public toilets (very clean and well-taken care of like all of the area), with dunes and informative posters on the animals of the ecosystem.
It is very nice and comfortable, so much for access as for spending time.
The water is quite cold and with many waves.
It's nice to hang out though I would not recommend it for swimming.

(Original)
És una platja llarga amb lavabos públics (molt nets i ben cuidats com tots els de la zona), amb dunes i cartells informatius sobre els animals de l’ecosistema.
És molt agradable i còmoda tan en accès com per passar-hi l’estona.
L’aigua és bastant freda i amb moltes ones.
És agradable per passar l’estona tot i que no la recomanaria per anar a nadar.</Review>
