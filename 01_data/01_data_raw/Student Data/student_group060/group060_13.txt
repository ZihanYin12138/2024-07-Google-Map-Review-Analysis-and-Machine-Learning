If you need HVAC service, we highly recommend Air Works Solutions and our technician, Sam Schaefer, for all your needs. They are honest, reliable and fair priced. The first company that came out greatly inflated repair cost and advisability and pushed for whole system replacement at outrageous prices which, of course, they could start same day. Our system is 11 years old and AIr Works Solutions added Freon and leak fix for 1/4 of what the upsellers quoted and said we had at least 10 to 11 more years on the unit. I guess the first company business model is to try  to take advantage of old people and Air Works Solutions business model is to do good work,</Text>

Cynthia went above and beyond to get my AC unit fixed the same day I called . Sam from AIRWORKS was at my house within 2 hours to fix my AC. He went out of his way to fix all of the issues and in no time my house was cooling off! Very thankful for their wonderful speedy service…..</Text>

Right when a heat wave started our AC unit failed.  Sam Schaefer from AirWorks Solutions, Inc came out and fixed it right away.  He was professional, detail oriented, patient, and answered all of our questions.  He took the time to educate us on the work being done on a level we could understand.  We now have an AC unit blasting to keep us safe from the heat!  Can't say enough good things about Sam, and Airworks Solutions.  If you get Sam on the call, you're in luck!< /review>

<Text>Air Works Solutions, Inc. Heating & Air, is  a business that really cares about their customers. We feel Sam, who rechecked our new system after an Electrician left the attic a mess, knew just what to do and was easy to talk to and explained everything to us. We are moving and will not hesitate to have Air Works install a new system in our property we are selling. Thanks to Sam and the installers and all the helpful women in their office!< /Text>< date>

<review>We had AirWorks install new duct work and replace registers at our house today. Our crew--Billy (lead), Mikey, and Caleb--arrived on time, ready to go. Aside from their professional attitude and good natured dispositions, they treated our home kindly, going as far as to walk quietly through the house (all hardwood floors) so as not to incite our already agitated dogs. All three guys kept us updated on their progress, communicated openly, and sought to perform the job with great care. In addition, they cleaned up afterwards, even picking up roofing nails left on our front lawn by previous workers. The company clearly hires good people who are intelligent and conscientious. We're very happy with our choice and believe you will feel the same.< /review>< Pictures>

I cannot say enough good things about the service provided by Sam and AirWorks Solutions on my furnace & AC system over the past year.  Sam has deep-cleaned the whole system, performed regular maintenance, fixed a leak, replaced the dual capacitor, and installed a hard start kit to keep my aging AC compressor going!  Cynthia is always very personable and helpful when I call for appointment scheduling.  Sam is prompt, lets me know when he is on the way, is always extremely professional, knowledgeable, and detailed in his work, and he is very pleasant & kind on top of that!  His patience with all my questions and his ability to explain the system and any problems are greatly appreciated!  I would never hesitate to recommend AirWorks and Sam!<//Review>

We FINALLY got AC installed in our home by AirWorks a couple of weeks ago after putting it off for years. Such a great experience from start to finish! What a great team! From the bid, to the office staff helping with our questions, to the respectful, clean, efficient team of installers!!! Now those hotter summer afternoons won't be spent being miserable!
Thank you Airworks!!!! :-)</text>

Steve has been my technician since Jan. 2019. This last visit, He reviewed my 18 year old furnance and he recommended and I agreed that I needed an updated and more energy efficient one. Today, his team came out and installed it within 4-5 hours and I couldn't be happier. The change in air flow and heating up the home so quickly even though it was 89 degees outside today, was just so great. Then an hour after, I received word that Steve was stopping by to check on the completion of the work. I was just so grateful, because he checked everything a second time, and said all was working well as it should be. I will continue with AW solutions. Steve has been great!< /Text>

AirWorks is absolutely the best company to call for any heating/air conditioning matters. Sam is extraordinarily talented and  able to troubleshoot any concerns and resolve them with practical and professional expertise. AirWorks is definitely my go-to place for anything regarding the temperature of my home. Call AirWorks and see for yourself. You will not be either puzzled or disappointed.

<review>Rolando and Eddie were professional and did such outstanding work replacing our old, unattached ducts and all our registers. This was done in cramped attic spaces but they kept a great attitude. Sam came in today and put in the new thermostat and did some caulking. All three guys were outstanding!  Kelly is always ready to share her knowledge. Ameris and Cynthia answer questions with patience. We are certainly glad McKay Barlow helped us find AirWorks

<review>In addition to doing excellent work, one really cannot ask for better customer service than we have received from AirWorks Solutions. Cynthia in the office is amazing. She's friendly, kind, calming, dedicated and really good at her job. Our tech, Sam, was punctual, friendly, professional and good at explaining what to expect. Kelly (manager) and Amaris (scheduler) seemingly moved mountains to get us an install ASAP when our air conditioner went out on the hottest day of the year. Billy & Michael (our awesome installers) were early, professional and worked the problem of poor yard access to ensure we were good to go for the next heat wave. Happy to recommend this team to anyone who needs help with HVAC.
Note: We are tenants so weren't billed for service or install and can't speak to value for cost.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Kevin and team did a great job on our installation of a complete AC/Central Heating unit.

Their quote was very competitive and was returned in a timely manner.  We worked with Kelly, in the office who kept us informed on the process and continued to interact with us during the installation.  She also followed up with us upon completion...she was great to work with!
AirWorks contacts us periodically to schedule our yearly servicing as well as seeing if there is anything else we need.

We would defintely refer them to others!  Thanks!<//review>

Steve and the AirWorks family outdid themselves again!  Upon letting them know that my home was slated to get a full roof replacement, which would entail the removal of my unit and all of the ducting/components on the roof, Steve and the team worked lockstep with me at every turn.  Steve spoke with and met with my roofer on a couple of different occasions to discuss process and timing, and the AirWorks staff was very receptive to the constantly moving parts and schedule of the roof project.  What I came away with was my same unit (only a few years old) back up on my new roof, in a MUCH better situation than it used to be, with a new frame, all new insulated exterior ducting, and an overall cleaner look and efficient system.  This roof project overall was very stressful and time consuming and Steve/Airworks professionalism and customer service made this part of the project that much easier and better!
------------------
My family and I have been using AirWorks and Steve for years and I could not ask for better service!  When my wife and I moved into our new home, Steve came out to review our systems and set up a service and maintenance schedule that would be the most beneficial to us.  Steve is extremely professional, always prompt and clear as to what needs or does not need to be done, and just a great guy to chat with.  The rest of the AirWorks staff is always a pleasure to deal with and their services and professionalism are second to none!  I would highly recommend AirWorks and Steve for any and all home HVAC needs and service!< /Text>

<text>Thank you AirWorks! Especially Kelly and Sam! I spent the thanksgiving weekend with no heat and Kelly was able to get someone to my house first thing Monday.  Sam was great- was earlier than expected, polite and friendly.  He solved the problem quickly- the problem was The PacificAire tech that was put in March turned off the gas line... thanks PacAire 😐.  needless to say, AirWorks has a customer for life now. Way to go Kelly and Sam - great customer service!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Was VERY impressed with the installation crew of James and Billy. They worked diligently and professionally to complete our furnace replacement in one day. James delivered on his promise to fix the holes that the asbestos abatement subcontractors had created when they stapled plastic sheeting to the walls and ceilings. I could barely see the holes after he was done. James even offered to do touch-up painting over the now filled-in holes but I declined because it didn’t appear necessary.

I highly recommend Airworks. My only caution is to future customers who have asbestos-wrapped ducts that need to be removed. We had personal items (storage boxes, etc) in our attic and we didn’t know that they needed to be removed in order for the abatement team (subcontractors to Airworks) to do their job. So we were unprepared when the crew showed up and the project was delayed (so we could remove the items) by a week as a result. Plus I didn’t like that the crew put staples in the walls and ceiling and would have liked to be warned or given an alternative solution.<//review>< resp>

< review>
I am the HERS Rater for AirWorks Solutions. I inspect their systems and perform the energy efficiency tests required by the State of California. There are several tests which measure how efficient a system is functioning, including duct leakage, airflow rate and refrigerant levels. I am an independent third party inspector with no affiliation with the company.

Their systems routinely pass inspection. Duct systems are sealed to prevent leakage into unconditioned space (ie. attics and wall cavities), return duct sizing is appropriately sized and air conditioners always have the right amount of charge.

Many contractors don't seal existing duct systems when just a furnace or AC is replaced. THIS IS REQUIRED! This step is the primary reason why systems fail to pass inspection. AirWorks Solutions understands this and always seals their systems.

This is why I recommend AirWorks Solutions, they follow the building code and always adhere to the highest standards of installation quality and ethical business practices.</review>

< Review>
I’m updating my previous review for AirWorks Solutions, because within 15 minutes of posting my first review below an AirWorks Senior Customer Service Representative contacted me to express concern over my experience – very impressive considering it was a Sunday when most businesses don’t answer their phone let alone contact the customer directly.  The customer service representative (Laura) politely and professionally asked what was wrong.  She listened to my side of the story (without interruption), and then communicated how concerned she was with my experience.  Laura explained that what we encountered was extremely atypical, and that they wanted to take steps to immediately rectify the situation.  I was assured that both she (Laura) and the owner wanted to get our air conditioning working properly ASAP - the owner even offered to visit me the next day to personally evaluate the situation. I declined that offer, but did arrange for their technician to come back to our home and determine why the work they had done the day before didn’t get our air conditioning working.  The technician arrived early Monday morning, and did a full evaluation of the system to determine what had gone wrong.  He discovered a different part had failed since the work done the day before.  He then replaced the part, stayed on premises until the system was fully tested (over an hour.)  After the work was done they contacted us several times during the next two days to make sure all was still in working order.  It is understandable with older systems like ours that even the best of repair service companies can encounter unexpected challenges.  The integrity with which AirWorks handled our situation is commendable.  If you’re looking for a company that provides excellent customer service, and does so with a high degree of integrity, then I feel AirWorks Solutions is a solid choice.

FIRST REVIEW:
We had AirWorks Solutions come out to perform a full air conditioning system maintenance check.  The technician arrived (quite a bit late) and did the full system check. When he was finished he said everything was working properly, but there was some work that needed to be done in the future to keep the system working properly.  Two weeks later the air conditioning stopped working.  Seemed funny it had worked fine for years and after the AirWorks maintenance check it shortly thereafter stopped working, but we thought the best at the time and considered it coincidence.  So, we called AirWorks back out, and this time the technician said the condenser was bad and needed to be replaced - over $600 of work.  We agreed to have him put in a new condenser and the air conditioning worked again, but only for a few hours.  So, the next day we called AirWorks again, and to their credit they sent a technician back out that same day, and said no charge for the visit.  The technician said the condenser unit he put in the day before had blown out, which according to him was really a rare occurrence.  He and an associate put in a new condenser, ran a system check, and the air conditioning was working again - this time for a whole day and a half before it stopped cooling properly.  The temperature in our house climbed back to over 80° with the air conditioning system blowing nothing but hot attic air.  So, that rare case of the condenser going bad didn't seem so rare to us - twice in 5 days two of them failed.  We think the technicians didn't really understand the system and put in a condenser that wasn't compatible with the rest of the system, which ultimately caused it to fail.  We are now going to have another company check things out and provide a second opinion.  AirWorks Solutions didn't get our air to work - their solution was a total failure.  Yes, they give good phone service, are good at getting a technician to visit, but that ends up not really mattering when the end result is money spent to accomplish nothing.</Review>

It was frustrating for me, because I know what a fantastically skilled team we have. Visiting a home multiple times for the same system is not what we do at AirWorks. That being said, agreeing to giving us another opportunity to repair you system, is greatly appreciated. We have you scheduled per your request for Tuesday morning for our first available appointment. We look forward to seeing you then.\n\nHave a great day,\n\nLaura'}< /resp>

<Text>Kevin was awesome in finding the reason my A/C stopped working.  I called on Friday afternoon and Kevin was here Saturday morning.  I also would like to mention that last year, Steve handled a very difficult warranty situation.  The original HVAC installer would not help me so I called AirWorks Solutions and Steve stepped up to the plate and arranged and fixed everything.  And this was when Newbury Park was suffering under 110 degree temps!! Airworks provides very honest and affordable service.  Thank you!!!!<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Jason and the whole team (James, Mike, Dustin, Eddie, Billy - hopefully I didn't miss anyone) did an excellent job installing our HVAC system. When we were searching for/getting quotes from installers, we had a fairly large, well-known Conejo Valley-based company stop by to give us a quote. But, then, we never heard back from them after that day, which seemed highly unprofessional for such large company. We also received a quote from AirWorks and we could definitely recognize a difference in the professionalism and dedication to their company. We didn't feel as if we were just a "number". Jason stood out as honest, professional, and willing to go out of his way. So, it was a no-brainer to go with them. Their rates were also fair, especially for the amount of work we had done. With our system, we practically had to start from scratch, as our heating unit needed to be replaced and our house was not yet equipped with air conditioning (which included replacing our ducting). Needless to say, it was a big job. But, the whole team remained professional and kind throughout the whole process. There was a point when they were understaffed, which understandably happens every once in a while. However, they remained upfront with us and even went out of their way to try to pick up the slack. They also were sensitive to our 8 month old son by vacuuming up in his bedroom and our hallway (the majority of work was being done in both locations) afterwards/keeping things as contained as possible with a baby around, as well as taking the time to say "hi" for a little bit every so often. My husband and I were pleased with them and the job they completed. We would definitely recommend them to others, which we already have!</Review>

We live in a home built in 1951 with many quirks including no attic space for ductwork, exposed beams in part of the house, half raised foundation/half slab - lots of roadblocks, if you will.  Kevin was my third call and offered HVAC system suggestions the other two had not.  He came over personally twice to discuss my concerns about the previously installed illegally system and to inspect and come up with a solution that would be the most economical and effective.  He gave us a very fair price and showed up as promised.  Install was performed by him and a few of his guys, was pretty quick and very efficient.  His team was clean, polite and professional, and they even hauled away the old system.  Since installation a couple years ago, we have had them come out a few times, once for a weird leak in our mini-splits -- to which they responded immediately -- and twice for normal maintenance.  Kevin's team in the office is always polite, eager to help and accommodating.  They take all requests/concerns seriously and follow up to make sure any issues have been resolved appropriately.  I have recommended them to many including our old preschool who had our same units installed by Airworks about a year after we did.  I will continue to sing their praises...I consistently have nothing but positive experiences with them.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80e8361b8857b225:0xf74dcba32da38eda</gmapID></record>

<Review>The men and women at Airworks Solutions were fantastic!  Their customer service was spot-on and my family could not be happier with the products they installed, the technicians that installed them and the price points for all involved.  We compared them with other companies in Ventura County and, while they weren't the cheapest, they weren't the most expensive either.  Their email and phone communications were timely and their scheduling was very flexible and accomodating.< /Review>< pics>

Having been a patient of California skin Institute for many years (in the SF Bay Area) I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they had a location here in Newport Beach as well. Upon arriving for my appointment the personnel at the front desk were very friendly and professional. However things went downhill from there. I filled out all the required paperwork even though all this information was already in the system. Moreover, I don’t believe anybody bothered to read any of it. The pre-screening nurse proceeded to ask me exactly the same things that were included in the paperwork including my history of skin cancer. All this was well documented in my records with California skin Institute.
Upon entering the exam room the doctor   did nothing more than a cursory exam and was quick to utilize “Freon” Without even asking if that was the treatment I wanted. I tried to explain what I expected in terms of an exam and requested a full body check up. I was clearly given the “bums rush” which was clearly unprofessional and very disconcerting. I will definitely seek another dermatologist going forward< /review>

The office staff is very sweet and very competent. Dr. Herzlinger did a great job & took off all the trouble areas on my body and is sending them to pathology. His bedside manner is very pleasant and fun. He’s very professional when it comes to your skin.</Review>

Dr. Gregory Henderson and his staffs (especially Jenny) were great! This was my first time visiting this doctor office and my experience with Dr. Henderson was remarkable! Dr. Henderson was able to diagnose my skin issues and treated me right away.</text>

Dr. HERZLINGER has cared for me for over 18 yrs, he’s helped me through skin cancer, acne and other growths that have appeared. I changed my insurance but continue to see him for a reasonable cash price. I highly recommend his practice!</text>

<review>I've been seeing Dr. Herzlinger for over ten years. I have skin that is prone to skin cancer and Dr. Herzlinger always takes the time to be thorough. He is top notch in every resect. He also knows a lot of good doctors and is an excellent referral source. He has my highest possible recommendation.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dce08f089999fd:0x2ce0c99133e5cd43< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Aaron is great to work with! He and his staff have always responded quickly to my questions and concerns. When I’ve had life changes (new car, new house, husband passing away, elderly mom moving in, etc) he’s been great about getting all he needs to know about the situation and presents me with insurance options that best meets my needs, and with great rates! He was also able to help a friend after her homeowners policy was recently canceled.  I highly recommend this agency – I’ve been with them for many years and have been very happy with their service!<//text>

<Text>I don’t even know where to start with how helpful Bridgett has been with any of my cars over the past years.

Lemme just keep it short and sweet. Absolutely on point and so attentive without any hesitation & with the greatest attitude.

Aaron Sessions and his team have been servicing our insurance policies for 5+ years. Every interaction, regardless of who answers the phone or responds to emails, has been handled professionally, promptly and with personalized attention. I appreciate that we’re not simply an account number when calling an 800#. The regular review of our policies gives us peace of mind that we have the right amount of coverage. In the end, it’s all about protecting what’s most important. Aaron’s team helps us do just that.</Text>

<text>I wish everyone would conduct business the way Bridget and Aaron Sessions have for me. They've been my insurance company for over 11 years now and have made every contact pleasant and simple. They've helped me through homeowners insurance, multiple automobile policies and personal liability insurance. Bridget has been more than accommodating, has promptly answered all of my questions (there have been a lot) and gotten back to me with lightning speed anytime I've ever needed anything.
Aaron has gone out of his way multiple times to explain in layman's terms what I should have in terms of coverage and why. I really can't say enough about how great this particular office is. I'm lucky to have been introduced to them years ago.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Aaron Sessions is the BEST insurance company you can find. Always in contact when needed. When we had to evacuate our home due to California wildfires, they proactively reached out to us to see if we were OK and see if we needed anything. ABOVE AND BEYOND!!!  Use. Then with comfort. Great folks!</Review>< pics>

<Text>The team at Aaron Sessions are fantastic!! I have been working out of state for the last 11 months and every time I have needed them they are right there. I have been a Statefarm customer for more years then I can remember. When my previous agent Gary retired I found my self on Aaron’s doorstep and I couldn’t be happier.

Thanks for everything!!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I've been with State Farm for over 10 years. When we moved to Campbell, I switched my agent over to Aaron Sessions and his team (Bridget, Beth, Krista, ...). They are all extremely knowledgeable, professional and proactive -- always reaching out over the phone for annual payment reminders, suggestions for lower rates and so on. If they need a moment to double check policies on RV rentals, they will do so and get back to me right away.

On the couple of occasions where we've needed to make claims, they are always easy to get to, working with claim adjusters and repair shops to get us what we need promptly.

<review>I have been with State Farm a long time and have had several other agents before Aaron Sessions and I’ve always been happy with the service. Aaron took over when my previous agent left and I can say without a doubt him and his team take care of me just as well as the previous if not better.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I switched to State Farm over 5 years ago because of a bad experience with Progressive. I was looking for an insurance company that was "old school". I wanted a direct contact and someone I can actually talk or email quickly if I had questions or issues. Aaron Sessions office is exactly what I wanted! They answer my questions quickly and if they do not have an answer they look into it.

Aaron, Krista and the entire office work as a well oiled machine. I trust them and what I like the most is that they are honest. I am so happy I switched and if friends ask I definitely tell them about Aaron Sessions and team!< /text>

<review>I have been working with Beth at Aaron Sessions' office for almost 15 years. After my husband passed away in 2007 and I still had three school-age children at home, Beth partnered with me to make important financial decisions that I was not comfortable making alone. She is always looking for ways for me to save money and at the same time, take into account that my situation is continuously evolving. I am very grateful for their professional guidance.< /review><user_name>Stephanie Schiro Ronco</user_name>< user>

I've been with Aaron Sessions over the past 9 years.  Aaron and his crew, including Bridget, have always been the best.  They respond quickly with my concerns.  They seem to always be available.  They are always looking for ways to save me money.  They don't try to oversell anything, only what you need.  I have many different types of policies with Aaron and feel comfortable that his team is watching over my best interests.<//text>

<Review>I really do feel like I have friends at Aaron Sessions' State Farm. I've been with this group for probably over 10 years and I've always been treated with great customer service.
It first started with Beth, or Beth from State Farm as I call her, she's great.
Recently, several times, I've had the pleasure of working with Bridget, who I now will call Bridget From State Farm. ;)

Here's the latest example of why I continue to work with my friends at State Farm. On Tuesday my company realized that one of our work vans had been vandalized, so I called my State Farm office and Bridget answered the phone, I told her the story and she immediately go me connected to the claims department to open my claim, which was also very simple and convenient. They referred me to a local repair shop and within a couple hours our van was picked up and towed to the repair shop. Less than two days later, yesterday, we received an estimate with bad news that the part they needed was on back order and would take two to three months to arrive, what!!!

This not being acceptable I immediately called state farm and guess who answered, Bridget. I told her what the repair shop had said and that it wasn't acceptable to our business which needs the van, she understood and called the repair shop. A few minutes later she called me back and told me the shop is now prioritizing our repair. later in the day, again yesterday, she called back to tell me that the shop located the part in Fremont and would pick it up before the end of day.

Here's the amazing part. I just got a call from the shop saying the van would be ready at 2pm today! Is Bridget the best or what?!?!?!

Call State Farm today and ask for Bridget, if she doesn't answer.<//Review><user_id>107835506683879504306< /user_id><Date>1610757876621<//Date>< gmapID>

Really fantastic office! I switched over to Aaron Sessions' office about a year and a half ago after having an awful experience with my previous agent and I'm so glad I found them! Aaron was great in our initial meeting and took the time to go through my policies and explain things clearly to me without being "salesy". He has a very trustworthy, easy but caring demeanor about him which was so different from the agent I had before. Bridget is also fabulous and is my go to for when I need to get things done quickly. Based on my experience, the owner of the agency dictates the culture of the office and sets the expectations and standards for their employees and it's evident that this office places a high value on professionalism and maintaining trust with their customers. I definitely feel like I'm being taken care of and with that comes peace of mind.</text>

When my car was hit on the freeway, State Farm quickly approved a rental car and started working on the damage estimate.  The car was correctly deemed totaled and I received an adequate check to replace my car.  Very happy with the quick process and dealing with compassionate staff.</Review>

< review>
Our family has had insurance with State Farm only and the same agent up until a few years ago.  When John retired we were shuffled around to different agents, not feeling like a valued client after 50 plus years, until now.  We transferred our policies to Aaron Sessions office after reading  good reviews.  We had a lot of changes to make after a death in the family and Bridget handled everything for us.  I had lots of questions and the Head Office made some errors, however Bridget made sure it was all taken care of.   All was done through email and she is always, polite, pleasant, responsive and more than efficient.  You can tell she takes pride in taking care of the client.  While I hope to never need to place a claim,  I feel confident in knowing that we will be taken care of  and Bridget is a huge asset to this office.</review>

<text>I got a text message from Krista in Aaron Sessions office asking me to send my odometer reading for the car so that she can adjust the miles that we are supposed to drive according to policy and save money. I did send the readings and saved a significant amount because -- Covid and retirement made both my wife and I stay home for past 10 months except going out for shopping. I appreciate how quickly and responsively they helped me and saved money! Any time I talk with Aaron, I found him to helpful, cordial and I do really believe that he is being a good neighbor!

I am very pleased with my experience meeting with Aaron.  I have future plans for remodeling and wanted to find out how/what should be changed with my current policy.

Aaron took his time explaining my options so I knew exactly what he was talking about and I could make the right decisions that were best for me.

I was also interested in fire and earthquake insurance. He did an excellent job explaining why they should be considered as important added policies.

It was a good experience and I was very grateful for the time and details he took to help.<//review>

Aaron Sessions has been my agent since he started with State Farm. My experience with Aaron and his fantastic team has always been professional and accurate. They have always been extremely helpful and resourceful with all my questions and concerns. The knowledge, understanding, and commitment they provide, made me truly understand the importance of insurance, especially life insurance. If you are looking for an agency that will greet you with open arms, bend over backward to deliver on their promise, help you navigate through life challenges, and set you up for retirement success, you need to give Aaron and his team a call. Trust me, I would not have been with them for all these years if I did not believe in them or trust them 100%. I can't say I have always agreed with State Farm, but I can tell you I have always appreciated the openness and candor Aaron and his team provides. Thanks for all that you have done and will continue to do for me and my family.< /Text>

Aaron is great! He goes above and beyond to make sure you are getting the right product you need. He really takes time to listen to your needs, and goes over everything to make sure you understand what you are getting. I really appreciated how he went over my current home and auto insurance, and explained in detail what everything means and made recommendations even when I didn't even have these policies with him. Highly recommend him!</text>

<review>This is something I’m not really comfortable doing but I felt I wanted to do...
I like to give Bridget Barbieri at Statefarm Ins. In Campbell,Ca. A special thank you and complement her on her quick and thorough response to my recent request in changing some of my auto policy coverage.
Thanks to her! I feel I made the correct decision in signing up with Bridge@Statefarm Ins.
I honestly recommend this company.👍🏿
Thanks again!

Specifically and recently, we’ve had the pleasure of working with Beth Young who helped us through placing various new insurance policies as well as reviewing existing policies to make sure we are adequately covered at the best value possible. Beth was patient, knowledgeable, and responsive in every step of the way.  She also suggested or informed us about certain factors to consider when placing a policy that we would have otherwise not known about.  It’s always stress free working with this team (even when I unfortunately had to call for a minor fender bender!)  We would highly recommend Beth and this entire team for those who are looking for knowledgeable professionals , reputable company, and most of all dedicated client service.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7</gmap_id></record>

<Text>I’ve been a customer here for more than 10 years and I’m probably one of their early clients as they started. You don’t really think of insurance until you need it and that’s what make Aaron and his team different. They are super helpful when you need them. They have grown significantly but they managed to maintain their customer care at a high level. They are super responsive and have great value. They are my GO-to insurance team. They offer everything insurance related and most importantly they will give you peace of mind!<//Text><response>None<//response><user_id>113771086819089143763< /user_id>< gmapID>

<Review>I got started with Aaron Sessions as my account got bounced from one agent to another a while back. I had some issues with insurance in general so I made an appointment with Aaron and we sat down and went through the whole thing, personal and for my business. Immediately it was clear that Aaron was exceptional. He was not only thorough and competent, he readily “went to bat” for me on a disputed item, and put a lot of good new thought and perspective into my business insurance needs as well. For the first time in my life I feel like I understand my business and personal coverage, and have confidence in it. Aaron’s team is always very responsive, updates me on Important items, and follows up on my requests or concerns. This is how insurance should be handled.<//Review><rating>5</rating>< response>

State farm transfered to me Aaron and his team when my old agent retired. They are wonderful! Very responsive and professional. They know their stuff too! If I have any questions and they don't know the answers they will get right on it and get me an answer right away. I met with them recently and they were quick to help me find ways to save money on my premium. I highly recommend them!<//Review>

I recently moved and was in need of Renters Insurance. I reached out to this agency because I have other friends who hold policies with them and had nothing but amazing things to say. I spoke to Aaron at first and he transferred me to Bridget. I just can't say enough about BRIDGET! She was super responsive, very friendly and answered all of my questions (and even asked me some I didn't think to ask) She followed up with me after setting up my policy to make sure I was all set. Definitely recommend using this agency for your insurance needs! ;)< /Review>

I’ve always received excellent customer service from Aaron & Krista. In fact, Krista recently went out of her way to save me some money on my car. I’ve never had an insurance agent do that before! If you need insurance, definitely give them a call.< /review>

I had moved to South Bay following years of State Farm great support in both MI and TX.  Arron and his fab team including a very wise advisor, Golden Retriever, did not disappoint. Lots of transitions moving into a new area, these guys made the insurance one nice and easy.  Cally driving, not so easy , had a auto accident at worst time possible , Krista took over. Helped with rental car to claims...great group!</review>

As a company leader my time is limited and I rely on experts in their fields to do what they do best. Beth Young and her team at Aaron's office are absolute experts that I've come to trust and rely on for all things insurance, even when our needs are is outside of State Farm's service area. Beth's helped us with all of our insurance needs to open three challenging new offices in less than six months. Not to mention the four established offices and multiple corporate vehicles that she continuously makes sure we're up to date with.

I know that if I need anything she's there to help. Not only does she look out for our "current" needs, she anticipates situations that helps me do my job better (and look good in front of my superiors).

Beth, You're the absolute best, hands down, and I can't thank you enough for everything you do.<//text>

Aaron Sessions State Farm has always been helpful with me and my family for several years.  When my children were learning how to drive Aaron Sessons helped me with the best coverage for both my house and the cars and went though the possible liability should they get into an accident.  I would highly recommend them for your insurance needs<//text>

Aaron has been my State Farm agent for years and have been very happy since switching over from another insurance company.  What I appreciate most about him and his staff is how friendly they are and their willingness to help as quickly as possible.  Whatever it is that you need they are on top of it.  They really go above and beyond to take care of their clients and although there are cheaper options in the market, Aaron and his staff really represent State Farm well and go above and beyond with their excellent customer care.  They deliver great peace of mind and the value they deliver isn't appreciated until you're in a pinch and really need help right away, in which case I know that this office will come though; I know because I had to actually needed their help :)  The biggest thing is that when you do need help, it's Aaron and his staff that help you, not an 800 number line.  When you call, it's the actual staff that works at his office and Aaron himself.  Please be my agent forever, you and your staff are really great!</text>

I have been completely satisfied with Aaron Sessions and his entire staff since choosing him for all of my insurance needs nine years ago.  I am always treated with respect and receive timely responses to my calls and emails alike.  The staff spends whatever amount of  time is needed to answer my questions and to address any / all concerns I have.

Krista Stouffer has become a great asset since joining Aaron's team. She is always (yes, always!) pleasant and professional.  She is quick to help and makes sure that I'm satisfied before wrapping up whatever we've worked on together. I appreciate her thoroughness and "it's no trouble at all" attitude.

I continue to recommend Aaron to my friends and family.<//review>

<Review>Aaron and Bridget are amazing to work with getting back to me immediately with suggestions and answers. I was using another insurance company for 40 years (with no personal contact) so it goes without saying that State Farm is  the only company that I will work with. The referrals I have given them have been extremely happy as well.
Grateful to have found them.<//Review>< rate>

<Review>I’ve been with Aaron and his crew for over a decade. I moved out of the South Bay Years ago and into the Central Valley, but they’re so nice and easy to work with that I’ve stayed with them anyway. They are pleasant, professional, and always make it easy for me to manage my insurance needs whenever life changes. As far as pricing goes, I know I’m getting a good deal too. I sometimes get quotes from other companies (when the budget gets tight), but over the years I have never gotten a better rate than State Farm. So that makes it easy to stay too.

Thanks Aaron and MANY thanks to your reps for always taking care of me.<//Review><GmapID>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7</GmapID>< rate>

I contacted Aaron's team a year go to switch car insurance providers.   Since then, Sal has been very responsive and helpful when issues pop up.  I recently reduced my mileage (due to remote work).  Even when the central office mis-calculated my update, he followed up with them the same day to re-process the request.

Thanks Sal for the quick, effective and friendly responses!<//Text>

We have been clients of Arron for years.  When it came time to add our son as a new driver, the process  could not have been easier. One call to Bridget in his office and it was all taken care of. I was given options for coverage and a very reasonable price.  Thanks for taking care of us!< /Text>

<Review>I love working with Aaron and his staff, mainly Bridget Barbieri! She's fast, she's available on email, phone, and text.  She treats me as if I'm her only customer (i know it is not the case).  I have been with Aaron and State Farm for over 7 years now, I left AAA after 20 years and very happy I have done so!< /Review>< Response>

His hand picked team is truly the best group of insurance agents you will find. They are professional, polite and genuinely want to do whats best for you. I never feel like there is any pressure to purchase anything that I am not comfortable with. While other agencies seem pushy and only want commission from your purchase, the atmosphere in Aaron's office the exact opposite of that.

Before I was with Aaron Sessions, I never really understood the insurance policies that I had. I just knew it was against the law to drive around without insurance so I bought whatever the agent said I should have and that was that. It wasn't until Aaron explained and broke it all down that I finally understood what I was paying for and why it was necessary. Aaron's team is not only dedicated to selling you good/quality insurance but they are also dedicated to making sure that you understand exactly what you are paying for. They go above and beyond to make sure everything you buy suits your actual needs. After all, why would you pay for Hurricane insurance if you live in California?! Or why would you buy boat insurance if you don't own a boat?!

Beth Young personally handles all of my accounts with care. She follows up with me each year to make sure my policies are still relevant to my current needs. We do an annual touch base just in case there are any changes to my family. She is always happy to give me a quote for anything I may need and responds to my requests within a reasonable time (usually within 24hrs).

There's no better agency to go to if you are looking for insurance of any kind. I highly recommend Aaron Sessions.<//Text>< Name>

<Text>I was unlucky enough to have a deer damage my vehicle during evacuation with my family from the recent Santa Cruz wildfires.

As we have bundled home and auto insurance with State Farm I elected to get my vehicle repaired and  only wanted the best bodyshop to do the work. Once the shop inspected the damage I lodged a claim easily using the StateFarm phone app in around 10 minutes.

The initial claim was approved the same day so I could get the vehicle repairs started. When more damage was detected by the repairer additional claims were approved and paid without delay.

A member of Aarons team also reached out to me during evacuation to check our status and was able to confirm all our coverage was up to date and adequate in case we faced a real risk of total loss of home and other vehicles. Luckily our home was spared.

To have an insurance company provide such prompt processing, approval and payment during such a stressful time was an incredible asset to lowering our stress levels and gave tremendous peace of mind.</Text><name>Gordon Everitt< /name>< gmap_id>

<Text>Its been a pleasure working with Beth Young and entire team at Aaron Sessions office. They have been very responsive and patient in all the ad-hoc requests made for the documents. They also recommend insurance products from time to time which might suit our portfolio. ( But never try to over-sell anything ). Their rates are always competitive and they went above and beyond to find us correct insurance coverage based on our needs. Will refer them in a heartbeat to anyone!<//Text>< Rate>

I love State Farm! Bridget has always been extremely fast with her responses to my questions. She is endlessly helpful and always clearly explains my options in choosing auto and life insurance. I value the way State Farm takes the time to help me with my individual needs. If you are in need of an excellent insurance provider, contact State Farm and ask for Bridget!</review>

<Text>I have had vehicle insurance through Aaron Sessions’ office for about 18 years now and would never think of going anywhere else. No matter who I talk to, I am always well taken care of with professionalism, kindness, patience and sincerity. Aaron, Krista and Bridget are awesome—they have helped me most recently with some changes, and I always appreciate their fast responses along with kept promises. When I am told something will happen, they are always true to their word. Last, I never have to worry about losing unnecessary money, as they are ever vigilant in having my back. Thank you so much guys!< /Text>< username>

As a mortgage broker since 1997, I have have worked with many insurance agents in the process of securing mortgages for my clients.  I have never though worked with one more on top of their business than Aaron.  His professionalism, knowledge and forward thinking approach to his business and customer service are 2nd to none and why I send my clients to him.  I know they will be taken care of the same way I do and that means a lot to me to encompass the entire home buying experience.  If you need insurance services, I can't recommend Aaron and his team enough!<//Text>

<text>"LIKE A GOOD NEIGHBOR, STATE FARM IS THERE" At Aaron Session's office, it's not only a jingle but a fact! The best part is, We have our very own personal  "Jake" but her name is "BETH"! and yes, I've had to call her at "3 in the morning" but never have asked what she's wearing!

In October of 2019 my car window was smashed in and broken into. This happened just hours before boarding a flight out of the country for two weeks! Beth and the Sessions team was there to help me file a claim, repair my car, detail my car, received compensation for the items stolen, car rental, etc. and during this whole ordeal, Beth was hand holding this thing all the way to completion!

The level of care, service, professionalism, follow through and efficiency will not be found elsewhere. It really should be,

After recently finding it necessary to add Renters Insurance to my policy, State Farm has been incredibly helpful each step of the way. While this is my first time buying Renters Insurance, I feel well informed and prepared. From the beginning, I was redirected to my agent, Aaron Sessions, and his wonderful team, including Bridget, who has personally walked me through each step of the process. Bridget has delivered clear and thorough information to me and has responded very quickly to each of my requests. Not to mention, immediately making sure all discounts applicable were activated on my policy. Thanks to the team at State Farm, I feel like I can always count on the support I may need when it comes to my policy.<//review>

I can't recommend this office enough to anyone looking for insurance. The service you receive here is superior to cheaper agencies like Geico and Progressive.

I just retired and have been like most others at home for safety reasons. I was treated very well when renewing my policy. I was asked the right questions about car use, sheltering-in-place and other factors, like mileage that  might change the status of my policy.  Payment was collected a later to help economically. I could not have asked for more.
Thank you for the VP treatment during this pandemic!</review>

I can't recommend this office enough to anyone looking for insurance. The service you receive here is superior to cheaper agencies like Geico and Progressive. Reach out to them and ask for Sal, you will not regret it.<//Review>

He took us through the quoting process and explained everything thoroughly and answered all of our questions and we had a ALOT.  Everything was handled with the utmost professionalism AND best of all we actually ended up saving money on our policies.  I am really happy we made the switch from our old insurance company and have found a new office that gives us such great customer service.< /review>< Pictures>

I literally changed my comprehensive insurance package years ago to State Farm even though they represented the individual who caused the car accident.  They were so responsive, concerned and fair to me (and continue to be that way) that I decided to switch companies.<//text>

In the brief time I have been served by Aaron Sessions
& his Customer Response Team (including Bridget Barbieri),
I have been pleased by their helpfulness, (including clear explanations),
cheerfulness & quick response (even during the Wuhan Virus period).< /Text>

< review>
I use to be with Liberty Insurance but when I moved to Rinconada Hills in Los Gatos, Liberty refused to insure my new home claiming it was fire-prone.

My mortgage broker recommended Aaron Sessions State Farm for insurance.  They gave me a fair quote for Home and Auto Insurance and made sure I got all the discounts.

After closing, Aaron and his support staff of Krista and Beth have been very helpful.  Aaron also invited is into his office to review the coverage in detail.  He also offered to review our long term care insurance.

When he did he explained what I had bought 10 years ago in plain English and made it very understandable. Plus he didn't try to sell us anything.

Aaron and his team have provided the best insurance support I have ever had.

Highly Recommended!</review>

Krista Stouffer is amazing!  She caught something in our policy before it became an issue, contacted me, and resolved it all in the same day.  Aaron and his staff are always friendly and courteous on top of being totally competent!!</Review>

I have been working with State Farm Campbell on getting a Car and Renters insurance (after considering other companies of course). I appreciate the great service and high coverage options.
Beth Young does an excellent Job getting you the right deals and was always very fast to respond to my E-Mails (which is my preferred way to communicate). There is also the option to go to the office where you will experience the same great service.< /Review>

In all my years as a consumer end-user as well as a self-employed person, I've very rarely experienced on a grand-scale, consistent basis, such exceptional treatment as a client then I have from this most excellent, top-of-the-line insurance provider!

Seriously, if you're looking for an insurance provider and a place to call home when it comes to all of your insurance needs, don't concern yourself in spending even one more second in going beyond this gem of a "got it all together" insurance office.

Not at all to sound corny, but, seriously, "like a good neighbor, Aaron Sessions and State Farm are there for you!" Mark my words, once you become their client, you'll never look back.

I cannot tell you how many individuals that I've personally recommended to this office. In fact, there have been times when I've actually conferenced a call between friends and Aaron's office to introduce said friends to this first class outfit.

It's a wonderful feeling to never have even one iota of a doubt that the friends and associates that mean much to me will consistently and invariably receive "second-to-none" customer service - integrity abounds from whichever team member answers the phone because Aaron has, literally, the very best and most genuine and most professional individuals working in his office.

By the way, if you happen to have Bridget answer the phone when you call this office, oh my, you will be speaking with, and mark my words on this, one of THE most professional, knowledgeable and pleasant individuals you'll ever encounter from any business, period, end of story! Aaron really scored big time when he hired her Bridget!

She is an absolute gem and what a tremendous blessing and true asset to Aaron - he should be ever so thankful that Bridget is on his team and part of his business.

In addition, having personally met Aaron on numerous occasions at his office over the many years that I've been a client and knowing and experiencing his integrity, I'm quite confident that he often reflects on what a blessing he has in his midst like of the likes of Bridget.

What is so amazing too, as mentioned in the beginning of my review here, that when you call Aaron's office, any individual who answers the phone will immediately win your confidence, the staff working there "really are" THAT good! So, you can imagine if you happen to get Bridget on the other line as your representative that you're in for a real treat!

Well, that's my full report!

Quick FYI: Let me be super clear that I have no relatives or connections to anyone working at Aaron's office and no one has coerced me to write this review.

Consider this review and this highest of recommendations a true joy for me to write because it has been a true joy to write.

By recommending Aaron Sessions and his first-class team, I know that I know that I know that I've helped someone along the way (and hopefully many along the way) who desire to look no further for the very best insurance office for all of their insurance needs!</text>

I have known Aaron Sessions for over 8 years. He is a great person and great agent. I have had and still have several insurance policies with him covering both business and home liability for many years. His team is always friendly and courteous. Whenever I need to provide proof of insurance, Aaron and his team take care of my request while I am on the phone. I don’t often encounter this high level of service. I give Aaron and his team my highest recommendation.<//Review>

<Text>I have been purchasing my insurance from Aaron Session's office for the last 4 years. I feel very blessed to have had the opportunity to work with Bridget during this time. She offered me the care and responsiveness that I feel should be used as the standard. Not only is she easy to talk to, she really listens to your needs and offers the best policy to fulfill those needs. She is just awesome at what she do! Thank you Bridget for all of these years!<//Text><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7< /GmapID>< rating>

Aaron Sessions and his staff always reply promptly without sales pressure or upselling, and even offer ideas to save money.   Haven't had a claim yet so I'm not sure how smoothly that will be handled.  It is worth checking them out when it is time for comparison shopping or adding a new policy.< /review>

State Farm is always professional, courteous, and helpful when I call... and I always get a live person on the phone. Bridget and Aaron recently assisted me in problem-solving around an issue I had with flood insurance through my HOA. They both spent time to address this with me, even though the issue ultimately had nothing to do with my State Farm homeowner's insurance... yet they still assisted! It was greatly appreciated.

I wrote the above paragraph several years ago, and I am chiming in again. After 20 years with Aaron Sessions State Farm, I have had nothing but positive experiences. Friendly customer service/timely and thoughtful e-mail replies, clear communication, and coverage that has always been reasonable and helpful in all situations. Bridget recently assisted me with transitioning and changing some of my coverage after selling my home and moving. I will now have a new State Farm agent since I moved 3,000 miles away - and I will miss Aaron Sessions. They have consistently set the bar high.< /Text>

They were very friendly in the office. We had Gary Wenberg for years and when he retired it got to be a mess with State Farm. I was looking for more of a family atmosphere like Gary had and I think we found it. Just had my first review on my cars, renters and life insurance. Aaron is very thorough explaining everything and the good and bad about everything.  He tries to save you money where he can. I am very satisfied in the 5 months or so I've had him. I do miss Gary though he was great</text>

We can't say enough about the hospitality and service we receive from Aaron and his team.  We've been loyal customers for many years and they have always gone above and beyond what we would expect from an insurance agency.

Our main contact is Beth, and she is a pleasure to deal with!  My wife and I always leave the office feeling secure, knowing that Aaron and the crew are there whenever we need them.

Living in San Jose, there are many other State Farm agents we could have chosen, but we gladly make the drive over to Campbell just for the outstanding service we receive here.  (Plus they offer free cold drinks while you're there)</Review>

<text>Aaron's been my agent since he took on the Campbell office and I couldn't be more pleased with how I have been treated. His staff is very attentive and always helpful. I no longer live in the area so I was afraid that this would mean I'd have to change agents to get good service, but that has not been the case.< /text>< username>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>We switched over to State Farm when we moved into our new home at the beginning of the year. First of all, combining our auto & home with them was WAY cheaper than other companies we looked at.

Second, Beth couldn't have been more helpful when making our decision. She answered every question clearly and was very friendly. Then, when we came in for our orientation, Aaron met with us on a Saturday afternoon and walked us through everything - even perks of our coverage we didn't know we had. He also added "i don't care if something happens at 2 in the morning - call me."

Even months into our coverage, if a simple question pops up I shoot Beth an email and I have an answer within a couple hours. Their immediate, friendly service and willingness to help puts us at ease! I'd recommend with no hesitations.</review><Time>1500641486244</Time><Gmap_id>0x808e351c9cfb39b3:0x1db32bbe818401a7<//Gmap_id><user_id>110001379757419926479< /user_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< user_name>

I am insured with Aaron Sessions (State Farm) for about 8 yrs now and have only positive things to share. Interacting with the friendly team is very easy and pleasant. The insurance products are easy to understand and also can be changed flexibly as your life situations change. My best experience with Aaron Sessions and State Farm insurance was a few years ago when the Loma Fire damaged my property and State Farm quickly resolved the damage to my full satisfaction. All my claims were quickly resolved and damaged to dwellings and personal property were quickly and fully paid for.  Cannot praise this insurance company higher. Would always go with State Farm after this experience. Neighbors went thru a lot of more trouble with their insurance companies.</Text>

<date>1493862153121</date><rate>5< /rate><Text>Greetings friends of San Jose! My name is Michael, and I recently moved to California from the East Coast. Though my only experience for insurance has been with State Farm, my time with Aaron has certainly been my best (from 3 states over ten years).

Moving from any state comes with many challenges. One of those challenges is a long list of transfers, such as car insurance, dental, school, etc. My agent 2100 miles away knew of Aaron and recommended him wholeheartedly. Still, I felt inclined to do my due diligence and researched several agents in Silicon Valley to ensure I would be taken care of if an emergency arose, God forbid. Don't waste your time researching-- this office is good people and deserve your resources. Bridgette handled my move seamlessly and made me feel a part of the San Jose community before I even got off the plane. Not only did she communicate with the Atlanta office without me lifting a finger, but she recommended places to live, restaurants to eat, and sites to experience.

Upon my arrival, a meeting at the office (on a Saturday, nonetheless) was recommended, but I could not find the time to get into the office. I called Aaron on the phone, introduced myself, and had a small conversation. Most of you will agree that seldom do actual agents take the time to speak with you, especially about smaller ticket items or just to check in. Aaron is available at any time if you feel that you need to speak with the 'big boss'. He will be there for your family, and he will make sure you are taken care of. Even on Saturdays...

The service Aaron's team has provided me to date has been nothing but spectacular. I would recommend any insurance customer (Auto, Home, etc.) in the Bay Area to consider this team to take care of you... In times of need, Aaron, Bridgette, Sean, and the rest of the crew in Campbell will make sure you feel important, and help you survive some of the most difficult times in life. I wholeheartedly suggest you give Aaron a chance. It will be a 5-star experience.

Best,
Michael Brown< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

All the agents in this office have provided fast and courteous service whenever I've had a problem or question. They will personally call you if you've forgotten to make a payment rather than letting things lapse or charging you a late fee.   Definitely has the feel of a small-town office in the halcyon days when good customer service was the norm.<//Review>

Based on the friendliness of staff and the quality of service, I would highly recommend Aaron Sessions and his staff at State Farm to all those searching for insurance. The prices are competitive with other insurance agencies, and I have continued to feel like a valued customer through the many years I have done business with this company.</Text>

<review>I am very happy with my car insurance and the amazing service that I receive from themy when I come into the office orevenue over the telephone.

Today I couldn't make it into the office and an agent inside the office name Krista Stouffer was very patient with me, and helped me find the best payment option for my insurance. She also made a suggestion for me to apply for a state Farm visa.

Thank you so much for all the help, I was able to get a payment plan that works best for me set up.

I'm also going to come into the office to sign up for life insurance.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Time after time I get great service from Krista at Aaron Sessions. Having to change policies 3 times a month, adding/increasing coverage, and removing other things due to moving to temporarily adding a rented RV that is covered (at no additional cost - might I add) ... They deliver and the turn around time is amazing!< /Text>

The bomb Tam's location. Hate to give it a great review because it'll be get very busy, but they deserve it. Great portions, friendly staff, owner who's there on location and actually cares about your experience. What a concept.< /text>

<Review>I can't say enough nice things about this place! The staff is friendly, educated and gives great attention to details. They all go outta their way to make you comfortable and Dr. T is my favorite dentist I've ever had!! I'm going to get an implant here soon and I'M EXCITED! No one likes dental work, but when you truly like your dentist and the staff then it turns into something you can look forward to.</Review>< user_name>

First of all let me begin by saying an amazing staff, great customer service, and appreciate detail attention on appointment. Dr. Thakher did a great job of taking look at my issues and letting me know exact steps needed to correct them. Will definitely will be back. Thank You!!</text>

<review>I’m not a fan of dentists but Dr. Takher is amazing!  It’s obvious he is passionate about his profession. He really uses his brain to try and solve your specific issues. I’m so glad I finally found a good dentist in this area! He’s got a great personality as well.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

<Text>I had such anxiety over going to the dentist for tooth pain! From the moment I walked in everyone was welcoming and warm without judgment for not being seen for a long time! They talked me through everything and answered all my questions with honesty. Taylor did my xrays and was patience and kind and made me feel at ease about everything! So happy I found this place ... is 10 stars a thing??< /Text>< Pictures>

This is my favorite dentist office ever.  Amzing how everyone that can, says good morning when you arrive and walk back.  They care about you.  No matter how difficult something gets, they dig in and make it right. I had a crown that just wasn't coming back from the lab quite right.  The fit wasn't good enough.  They never settled until it was perfect.  Never going anywhere else.< /Review>

I’ve been coming to this practice since I was a little kid, back when it was ran by Dr. Stuart. I got to say my experience was awesome. First time meeting the new doctor and staff. I shouldn’t say new because it’s been far too long before coming back to my dental office. The staff was great. Very informative and made things very clear and easy to understand with my appointment. Glad to be returning back to this uplifting and positive place. Highly recommend coming here if you need a new dental office. This will be your last time having to choose one. Because this place is the best. Thanks Pena Dental team!< /text>

<text>At Peña Adobe dental I had a great experience. All of the staff were kind and professional. Dr. Takher explained to me the procedures I would need but never pressured me to do them RIGHT NOW or tried to ‘sell’ like all other dentists I’ve ever gone to.

I’ve never liked dentists. I’ve always had bad experiences and spent money only to find out later it wasn’t necessary. As a result I’ve had no confidence in their honesty and always felt they were just there to line their pockets. Dr. Takher has changed that. I feel I’ve found a dentist that is honest and cares for his patients. He doesn’t try to make a buck by selling unnecessary procedures. I definitely recommend him.< /text><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808517e3ea31d4d1:0x9beb1395a814cd3a<//gmap_id><user>111047383101212648135</user>< rating>

I am/was terrified of the dentist. Dr Takher was then and has always been understanding, sympathetic & compassionate when taking care of me. The entire team is incredible. I never feel rushed or pushed into any treatment, things are explained thoroughly and the team here genuinely cares about the care they give. The office it self is clean and welcoming & the play lists are always on point.<//Review>< user_name>

When it comes to dentists, I've been to several and I can say it's difficult to find one who you can really trust. I was fortunate to eventually meet Amani and his wonderful team. They're direct, straightforward, clear communicators who set the expectations right and execute with high quality within a reasonable budget. I highly recommend Peña Adobe Dental Care.<//text>

Dr. Amani is an Amazing dentist & very patient! I have been to a share of dentist in my life, but this one has by far been the best. Everyone is so friendly & goes above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable. It's very clean inside and they are following covid guidelines! After I had a bad experience with another dentist, they got me in right away to be seen, and was very honest with what needs to be done. I highly recommend this place for any of your dental needs<//Review>

I was totally blown away by this experience. Everyone was amazing and had a very personable attitude. The atmosphere here is very customer satisfaction focused which started with front desk personnel. My hygienist Aileen (not sure how to spell her name) was so sweet and very detailed. The Dentist Dr.Takher was nothing short of amazing he made me feel like I was a part of the family. I know it sounds weird to say but  I am so happy and look forward to my next appointment❤️</text>

I have been using Pena Adobe Dental for about 4 years now. During that time the staff have been extremely helpful and kind to me. They always make me feel welcome in the office.

Dr. Takher is always positive, makes it a point to connect with everyone who comes in (even if they are just there for a cleaning with a hygienist), and takes the time to explain what he is doing during an appointment or answer any questions you may have.

There is a great team there!</Review>

< Review>
I was seeing Dr. Bosler 15+ years until my insurance changed. I decided to give Dr. Takher a try because of the supposedly good reviews but it ended up being a nightmare experience with a complication and having to get a tooth removed because of it. I felt like he wasn't honest with me and that the situation could have been avoided entirely. This was a few years ago. Thankfully I got lucky with regency dental right after seeing him and have been with them since.< /Review>

I got my new tooth! The whole process from start to finish was literally painless. I had a root canal and crown from a former dentist from over a decade ago. It went bad and he fix it. He did a great job. Had a great recovery. Have a beautiful new tooth. I can chew now on both sides. Nice coloring!< /Review>

<Review>First time going in was today for a cleaning.  I was instantly greeted by Dr. Takher, Aubri and I believe Nicole (sorry if I'm mistaken).  They all had an amazing attitude.  Cleaning was done by Aileen who was very personable and kind.  If nothing else, I would come back just to see Aubri at the front desk as her personality was perfect for me.

Came here after trying to get an appointment from my previous dentist for 4 months without a callback.<//Review></record>

This week I had my first visit with this office and I was nervous at first because I've been seeing my previous dentist for 10+ years and I wasn't sure if I was making a mistake by seeing someone else (cheating on my dentist) but I'm glad I did. The staff was very professional and pleasant, the office looked great and the dentist was awesome. We spoke about more than the normal dental talk and he also gave me information about what the real cause of my headaches and insomnia may be.

This dentist is amazing and I suggest that you give them a try. You wont be disappointed.<//text>

Always a good visit with Dr. Takher - who knows his stuff! My teeth are healthy and kept that way largely due to Dana and her excellent cleanings.<//Review>

This was the best dental experience of my 65 years of life. I am amazed at how comfortable I felt and had complete confidence in the care I received from Dr Takher and his staff. They were extremely kind and professional and I am absolutely confident in recommending Pena Adobe Dental for a fun dental experience!< /Text>

It made my experience very positive. They took care of my needs In a professional manner. I will definitely continue going there for my dental needs.< /Text>

<Review>I had the best experience at Dr. Takher’s office. I had a dental emergency and was given a same day appt that was quick and painless. They had me come in the following day for tx to be completed. The procedure was flawless, FUN, and quick! I couldn’t be happier with the amazing staff and Dentist that took care of me. I can’t wait to call this place my forever dental home! :)< /Review><date>1603333320532< /date>< gmap_id>

Clean and friendly environment. Staff was comforting, accommodating and knowledgeable. I was taken right in for my appointment, sat in the chair maybe a minute before they took images of my teeth, Dr came right in afterwards we decided on a plan of action and within the hour I was finished and scheduling a return visit.  I must add I gave 4 stars because like many I have had bad experiences with dental offices. But not this office they help ease my anxiety and took care of my dental needs in a timely manner.< /text>

Most people don’t like going to the dentist because pain hurts and pain in your mouth hurts more. However, the doctors and staff at Peña Adobe Dental make it easy and pain free.</review>

OMG!!!!  My son and I just had our first appointment, and I was blown away by everyone! Amazing staff, so kind, funny, down to earth, and very knowledgeable!  Dr. Takher is amazing!  He is knowledgeable beyond dentistry, and he genuinely cares about his patients!  I am so glad I made this switch from my other dentists office, and I am so grateful for all of the kindness shown to my son and I by everyone!<//text>

From the moment you enter the lobby, a greeting rings out like a chorus in harmony "Hello welcome to Pena Adobe  dental. " smiling faces acknowledging that you are there. The hygienist is smiling and showing you the way. Every touch is gentle and gloved asking for your distraction preference music, tv,. Then the best part The dentist comes in with a smile and a greeting just for you. He is confident, calming, and forthcoming with real facts about your situation. As he moves on to the next smiling patient,  you are satisfied with your interaction and when the numbness wears off.  NO PAIN.! Excellent  dentist. Im 65 and i don't like going to the dentist! Except this one.</text>

I've never been to a more pleasant, inviting, personable dentist or for that matter any Dr's office, therapist in my 44 years. The only statement that I can make to describe this office is: "I wish they did more than dentistry". Absolutely an enjoyable experience<//Review>

Dr. Takher and his Crew do not disappoint, from the time you walk in you are greeted with a smile and  and checked in From there you you are brought back by your hygenist who is very friendly as they get X rays preform your cleaning . Dr Takher is a guy who loves his job and you can tell he is very high energy but to the point . In and Out in about 45 mins and teeth are good for another 6 months.< /Review>

From beginning to end best experience I have had at a dentist, I have been goin to a different practice for years and recently my experience has not been good so I decided to make the switch and I’m glad I did! Deep clean was well worth it and I already made my next appointment! Thank you to all the staff and Dr. Takher for a Pleasant visit! Keep up the great work!< /Review>

I had just recently moved up north from Southern California and I was in desperate need of a dentist. I was in so much pain and had no idea why. It felt like I was going to need a root canal. I went in and they did my exam and xrays and they said there was no cavity so they didn't recommend I get a root canal, i was so relieved because that is not a fun experience either. He talked to me about what he thought it was and left the choice up to me to continue because Unfortunately my insurance didn't cover it, BUT I continued because I was desperate. I had to drive to socal for work again that same day so they did a temporary fix for me but I had instant relief and I am still feeling 100X better. I am so happy that he prevented me from doing a root canal. I would highly recommend this dentist office because even the staff is just amazing too! And I have had some pretty bad dentist experiences before.< /Review>

<text>I love Peña Adobe Dental. Everyone is so nice. Amani Takher is so good as his job.  I have a sensitive mouth and he knew what was the problem and fixed it.  Yeah!!  The hygienist did a great job, too.  I will not go any place but there.  Thank you for all you have done for my daughter and I.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I had horrible dental experiences growing up and always dreaded having to go in for a check up or to have work done. Dr. Takher changed my feelings completely. I no longer sit through exams white knuckled, and I always leave feeling especially grateful for everything he does for me. He has state of the art equipment, uses excellent judgement, and is highly skilled.  He is patient and takes his time to explain what my needs are. He provides options and gives advice based on my personal circumstances. I never Feel like he is rushing to get to the next patient. He genuinely cares and it shows.
Everyone in the whole office is a pleasure to be around! They are all friendly and welcoming and create a relaxing atmosphere the minute you step into the office. Each person is highly qualified for the specific job they are doing. As a team, you know you are being very well cared for. This review is coming from someone who never writes reviews of any kind! I feel like it’s the least I can do considering all of the time and energy he’s put into helping me with my dental care and feats!  There aren’t enough stars on the chart to accurately  rate him!< /review>

Every time I come to Pena Adobe Dental it just feels good. Yes a dental office that feels good. Dr. Takher is kind and incredibly talented. The whole office works together and again it just feels good. I’d take my two year old nephew or my 72 year old dad. ❤️❤️❤️</text>

<Text>The staff at Pena Adobe are professional, personable and take excellent care of their patients. My teeth cleaning was top notch! My next appointment will be a crown replacement of an old crown that I have had for 30+ years. Dr. Takher has already done one crown for me and I had zero pain during and after the procedure! I can honestly  say I look forward to going to Pena Adobe Dental Care because I am in GREAT hands, Literally!!!😁<//Text><userid>103481707943853955098<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Friendly, fast, efficient, thorough. I won’t try to convince you that going to the dentist is ‘fun’... but Pena Adobe is as good as it gets. I most highly recommend them for any and all dental work. They do almost everything. Implants, for example, are something that most dentists won’t (can’t) do. They’ve got it all covered.< /review>

The team at Pena Adobe Dental Care under the direction of Dr. Amani Takher provided highly professional care of my dental needs.  The office is very warm and welcoming upon arrival and you are given top notch customer service.  The team is very knowledgeable and explain each aspect of treatment thoroughly.  You get a sense that each employee loves coming to work each day, which reflects in the detailed service that they provide.

Really great experience visiting Pena Adobe Dental Care for the first time. I was greeted upon coming in, everyone was nice and made me feel welcomed and comfortable. The office was very professional and staff was phenomenal. Dr. Amani really showed interest in my dental history and concerns I had. I definitely see myself visiting again.</Review>

But from the time you walk in, to the chair, to the time you leave they really focus on making you feel comfortable. Dr. T is so fun and caring, all the Amber's are awesome and I love Aubrey, she is always very helpful and treats you like a friend when you come in. I wish I could give them more then 5 stars,  I reccomend them to all my friends and family. I actually like getting my appointment reminders! What a change! Love you guys!

I was extremely nervous. Upon coming in the techs and receptionists all introduced themselves. Each one said hello and welcomed me every where I went. The tech was thorough for my exam. Expect the first appointment to take longer than normal. I love they are thorough.

The doctor even fixed my bite. I have not been able to chew on the right side since a repair three years ago. After leaving the office I could chew on both sides of my mouth and my jaw felt less tense.

This place is incredible. They are out of network for the military insurance but they will work with you on payments. It is worth the money as you will walk out feeling better than before and know each person is checking your entire dental health.<//Review>< Date>

There are absolutely no words to express how absolutely awesome Dr. Takher and his team are!     The professionalism, knowledge and genuine caring that is shown time after time is exceptional.   I would recommend this office to EVERYONE that needs dental care - from a cleaning all the way to a very complex project on their teeth.    FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!</Text>

I searched for a year for a good dentist office and came across this one researched it, read everything I could. It was the best decision I could make the dentist Amani takher is very knowledgeable and just down to earth. And I can't say enough about their staff at the front desk both are very nice and helpful. This entire office just makes you feel comfortable.< /review>

Literally the BEST dentist and staff I have ever seen. Communication, attention to detail, cleanliness, professionalism, humor, kindness, understanding, quality of the work. These folks are perfect. I'm afraid someday everyone else will know about them and there will be a million people needing their flawless service. I am so lucky I found them.<//review>

I’v been going to Pena Adobe Dental for many years. Before Dr. Takher it was Dr Stewart. I never thought of going anywhere else. They always treated me like I was their only patient. Now I’m moving to Florida and have to look for someone else. It will be hard to find somebody that lives up to their standards. Thank you Pena Adobe Dental for everything.</review>

Today was my very first visit and I feel like I'm an old client!  The reception ladies are friendly, welcoming and helpful.  My hygienist had great technique, I hardly felt the usual discomforts!  Dr. Takher is really cool!  Tells me point blank what needs to be done and then gives me the time to decide what route I want to take!  Thank you for making going to the dentist a stress-free and painless adventure!<//review>

<Review>I recently relocated back to Vacaville after being away from the area for the last 10 years. When I called in Aubry was great in helping me schedule an appointment and when I came in I was greeted with a warm smile. Dr. Takher was super easy to talk to and I was pleased with his chairside manner. Having a background in dentistry I’m picky as to who’s chair I will sit in. I look forward to completing my restorative work in the office. Hannah and Nicole were also very helpful during my exit in helping schedule my follow up appointment for my cleaning. I feel confident saying I have found my new dental home. 😷😁< /Review>< Pictures>

The dentist was really nice also all the staff. I was in pain and I called them on Sunday and they gave me an appointment first thing in the morning even when I wasn’t a patient. Really nice service.< /review>

<Review>My wife lost her filling a couple days ago.  I had to call this place three times just to get a hold of someone to make an appointment and ask a couple questions.   When I finally did reach someone to talk to, I was told that they were not taking any new patients for the next two weeks due to some training or classes.  Then I was told that we would have to have an exam and x-ray appointment first for $160 (with no insurance) before she could even get the filling repaired.  All we wanted was to go in within a few days to get the filling repaired/replaced.  I make an appointment at Vaca Valley Dental instead.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1518123352080, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback, as we take concerns very seriously.  Please accept our apology for not meeting your expectations.  Our goal is to provide a great experience for every patient that calls or walks through our doors.  That being said, sometimes we must allow the voicemail to pick up so that we can focus our attention on answering the questions of the patient in front of us.  When a message is left on the voicemail, the call will always be returned as soon as possible.\nTo address your concern about the exam,  Dr Takher will always examine the condition of a tooth prior to making any treatment recommendations or giving any financial estimates.  Usually an xray is required for that, or at least a very recent xray from a previous dentist.  We do charge for this, but are happy to apply the charge to the cost of treatment when applicable.  We are simply unable to do quality work on teeth without the necessary diagnostic tools.\nThanks again, and we are happy you were able to find a dental office to take great care of you.'}< /Resp>< user_id>

Everyone at Pena adobe dental is very nice and knowledgeable. The atmosphere was relaxing and i felt very comfortable. Dr. Amani is easy to speak to and Aubri was able to give me info about my insurance that i was not aware of. I will recommend pena adobe dental to all my friends and family.</text>

I've never had a dentist that was so proactive, and fun to be around!

This is a corrected rating, in error I noted only 4 stars, they should get 6! but 5 is as high as it goes, please correct my earlier mistake-thank you.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I have only had one dentist my entire life. He recently had retired and was referred to this practice. Dr. Takher and staff are very welcoming as soon as you walk into the door. They make sure you feel comfortable and explain everything that is going to happen, next steps in care etc.

I will defiantly be recommending this practice.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I am 54 and have had issues with several dentists. Dr. Takhar is personable and appears to really care about his patients and employees. I had told him that I had a pre-existing condition prior to the work I needed done and was pleasantly surprised that he had spend the time to look it up and acquaint himself.

The first major item was done quickly and without pain. If you (like me) have issues with dentists, try the Pena Adobe Dental.<//Review>

Their friendly “girl (or boy) next door” approach makes you feel very welcomed and comfortable in the facility. Services? Off the charts. They truly are knowledgeable of their dental practice. I highly recommend becoming a dedicated client of theirs for all of your oral health needs. You’ll see exactly why I speak so highly of them!

I now know why. He is very friendly, professional and honest about best treatment options vs insurance. His whole team takes the time to ask how I am doing during procedures and ask how my Granny is doing. He even helped my Granny when she was concerned about my Papa’s mouth pain. He suffered from end stage dementia. Dr Takher made the time to see him and assess for any sources of pain. Definitely wholeheartedly recommend Dr Takher and his whole team from the smiling receptionists to the sweet dental hygienists.</text>< user_id>

Amazing. Not a word I normally associate with going to the dentist. Dr. Takher's passion for dentistry shows through in his knowledge and care. The staff is compassionate, educated and efficient.  I had major work done and can honestly say, this is the best dental care I have ever received.</Review>

For a young doctor, he is ahead of his years. Best of all he listens to what you have to say. Great guy, makes you feel comfortable. Office staff is always cordial and friendly.  Makes an sometimes unpleasant visit livable.<//text>

Staff friendly and very professional. Listened to my concerns. Dentist excellent and very approachable. Hygienist was very careful and did not cause me any discomfort. Nice location and clinic is not too large to feel impersonal. You get reminders via text!  Will recommend to others.< /text>

Amazing. Not a word I normally associate with going to the dentist. Dr. Takher's passion for dentistry shows through in his knowledge and care. The staff is compassionate, educated and efficient.  I had major work done and can honestly say, this is the best dental care I have ever received.</Review>

Pena Adobe Dental is extremely competent but even more important they are caring of my general health not just my dental health. With my health problems I can be a difficult patient but I am always treated by Dr Takher and his staff with compassion and understanding.</review>

Dr. Amani Takher and his team are very professional, knowledgeable, and are a lot of fun. Sometimes going to the dentist can be scary but the team at Pena Adobe is fantastic! I have been going there for years and would recommend that everyone in Solano County check out the facility. All of the equipment is modern and up to date and Dr. Takher makes it a point to get to know all of his clients on a personal level. Wish I could give Pena Adobe more than 5 stars!< /Review>

Pena Adobe Dental Care is a rare and exceptional dentist office. Recently, I went in for a new patient consultation, x-rays, and dental cleaning. I was apprehensive since quality dental care matters greatly to me, but every dental office has a different interpretation of what quality looks like. This office was exceedingly professional and personable. Aubri booked my appointment and got me in at the last minute after a cancellation which was awesome since they appear to book out pretty far in advance! She helped me understand my insurance benefits before I booked the appointment and was upfront about the out-of-pocket cost. Nikki was my hygienist and I really appreciated her friendly, thoughtful approach since I was worried about my gum recession and embarrassed because I felt like I should’ve been able to prevent the gum recession on my own somehow. Dr. Takher was thorough, sincere, and great at explaining my jaw clenching issue. He had a treatment/mouth guard recommendation but encouraged me to think it over since it’s an investment. His sense of humor coupled with his expertise makes him an outstanding doctor. This is a loooong review, but I want both Pena Adobe and anyone considering them as a dental office to know that this office is the epitome of thoughtful, intelligent medical care.</review>

I never thought I would ever look forward to going to the dentist, but Dr. Takher and his entire staff has done the impossible. Not only have I've received the highest quality dental care, but they've all managed to make me feel like I'm family.</Text>

<Review>Never really liked going to dentists because I felt they're really just trying to rip you off and still, your issues/problems with your tooth/teeth are never solved but since meeting Dr.Takher my views and opinions have changed. He has my trust and I refuse to go see another dentist. I'd rather wait when he'll have an available appointment than go to another dentist.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808517e3ea31d4d1:0x9beb1395a814cd3a</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Takher is fantastic and his staff is very professional. There is no dentist I'd rather go to. I wholeheartedly reccomend him to anyone in the area.< /Text>

Without question, Dr. Takher and his charming team are the most professional, friendliest, and compassionate in the area. I've never felt more relaxed in a dentists office than here. They don't push patients to have additional services that aren't necessary like some other practices, and Dr. Takher explained what my options were, answered all my questions, and never makes me feel rushed in and out. If you're looking for a Dentist to exceed all expectations, this is the practice for you. I look forward to my appts now, I've never been able to say that before!!</Text>

<review>I have been being treated by this Dental office for 20 years.  I was skeptical when the new Dentist Dr. Takher took over the practice, but I gave him a shot.  In the year or two, Dr. Takher and his team have been treating me my overall health has increased by 100%.  I have extreme anxiety and fear of having dental work performed and Dr. Takher and his team have alleviated that.  From Aubri at the front desk to Amber, Dr. Takher's assistant, the practice is stellar and friendly. Dr. Takher identified a huge undiagnosed cavity and extracted an ailing/cracked tooth that should have removed years ago. I have to give special thanks and appreciation to Tyra, the best Dental Hygienist anywhere she has been cleaning my teeth for years and treated and cured me of minor gum disease that could have developed into a severe medical problem.  I can never be reassigned from Tyra's care!  In short, Pena Adobe Dental Care is world class, to prove that I drive from the Bay Area to receive my dental care from this excellent, young, knowledgeable, caring and cutting edge team.  Thank you.

<review>Good price and great service! I had them do some major engine work and they where way less expensive than the dealer, I think they where more honest too. They also did a smog for me in about 20 minutes.<//review><name>jessethomas805<//name><gmapID>0x80eeb1f814d5bf73:0xadc262c35946bea9< /gmapID>< Pictures>

A few years ago I took my car to get smogged here. I had just replaced the battery (which will autofail the smog test) and took it here to get smogged without realizing the situation. Before the test started I told the mechanic what had happened. He knew that it would fail the test, and still completed it anyways. I don't really understand this logic, as he could've charged me a 10 dollar advice fee or something and I would've come back to this shop, where they would've gotten the same amount of money. I have no doubt they are capable mechanics, but since that experience I can not recommend them as I can not trust them. Seem to focus on making an immediate dollar at all costs over keeping a customer due to proximity to Isla Vista.< /review>

I come here regularly for oil changes and smog checks. Never a problem, always fast service, and family owned/managed. Recommended them to the company I work for and now even the retired boss comes here for regular maintenance. Definitely the spot to go to in goleta for whatever your car troubles.<//review>

<Text>Do not take your car here. These people scammed me when i came in for a smog check. They charged me to tell me my car had failed the check and then tried to charge me more to tell me what the problem was. I took my car to another auto shop afterwards, it passed the smog check, and they charged me less. Go to Fernando’s Smog Check instead, he is extremely knowledgeable and treats you like a human being as opposed to a paycheck.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Dropped in with no appointment to get a smog. My car would not restart. KaDon greatest me warmly. He had a man on it before I sat down.
They were able to hav my battery delivered quickly. Had to run monitors for smog. With great advise I was out the door. 30 minutes later back with monitors ready to go. Passed smog and away I went.
Casey’s team is great. See them for oil changes, tune ups, brake work etc
They are fair and honest<//Review>

BEWARE! DO NOT GET SMOGGED HERE! They DO NOT do free retests. They WILL NOT ask you any questions about recent service done to your car which could cause it to fail the smog test. THEY WANT YOU TO FAIL SO YOU HAVE TO PAY THEM A SECOND TIME TO GET RETESTED. TOTAL RIP OFF.

Instead, go to KENNEDY'S SUPER VALUE SMOG down by Milpas Street. They are about $15 cheaper and give you FREE RETESTS for two weeks!! I've been using them for years and love them. Should never have tried Casey's simply because the location was more convenient.< /Text>

I took my wife's car in for service, it came out of their garage with a warning light on. They claimed they knew nothing, even though the light was related to the work they did. They caused 3500 in damages. This is the second car & 3rd repair theyve screwed up. Someone is getting sued!</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Had to get my smog last minute for the DMV. Thanks to Casey’s I ran into the dmv, got my number, drove a few blocks down and got my smog ASAP! Ran back to DMV and made it in time to register my vehicle. Thanks for the quick and hassle free service. Would recommend!< /text>

<text>Had a problem starting my car here. They said the estimate would be 180 to see what was wrong but they said they didn't know what it could have been. Instead I got my car towed to another shop and they immediately gave me a couple solutions for free, one of which was the actual cause. Either they didn't want to diagnose my car or they just didn't know that. Either way it was unacceptable.< /text>< response>

I have always come here for my smog. It's a dirty garage with a worn down waiting room, but they do a great job and I always get good service. Shortly before Halloween I got a smog and came back to a few fun-size candies in a bag with a note saying, "You passed smog!" It's all about the little things!<//text>

< review>
After getting my catalytic converter replaced, I drove 50 miles as instructed by a wonderful muffler shop in Oxnard. I came in to Casey’s yo get my car smogged, and they went through the entire smog process and charged me, and then they told me that my car wasn’t smog-ready because some of the readiness monitors hadn’t reset. This was information they had readily available by plugging into the OBDII (which they did do prior to the test), but went through the process, they failed me and made me come back to re-smog.
I told one of the guys “if the car wasn’t smog-ready, why didn’t you tell me at the beginning before going through the process?”
And then he put the issue back on me by saying “if you had told me that you’d just had the catalytic converter replaced this wouldn’t have happened.” Then they sent me away asking me to come the next day.
I came back the next day and they passed me and charged me again. Happy that my car is smogged, but I can’t afford to be jipped. This whole interaction undermined trust.< /review>

This is the worst garage in town with the most unprofessional customer service.  They lied about the work necessary, over-charged for the minor work that was done, and hung up on me during a conversation.  We ended up filing a legal claim against them and winning a judgement for the repair costs, legal/court costs.  I advise you to stay clear of this establishment.< /Text>

The guy who answers the phone is so rude and nasty. I called to see if they found out why my check engine light came in and they said they were working on it right now and would call me back very soon. I waited hours before calling back to see if they had determined the problem. The man was so hostile and accused me of only calling 15 minutes earlier. It had been hours, and even if it had been 15 minutes I have every right to call as much as I want to see what is happening to my car. This place is horrible, and nothing could ever make me return there.< /review>

Brought in a late model diesel car. Despite having called in beforehand and asking about my TDI vehicle and the coupon available on their website, they told me it's diesel so it's extra and I couldn't use the coupon.
Little did I know the diesel inspection doesn't include running the vehicle at all, so it's even less work than for a gas vehicle.

They charged me double for something that was half as much work than normal that I also asked about in advance.</review>

Not sure if it's in their culture to be rude. But damn! Took my car there and they said a small piece of plastic that attached to a hose was broken and my car failed. So I took it to my mechanic and he said it was very suspicious how that piece was broken and in the spot it was broken in. He never seen that and if he had to guess it was broken by hand. I think these bastards are crooks and when you walk into their shop you get that feeling like they are gonna rip you off. Never go there again!!</Review>

Rude. Went in to have a vehicle smogged and ended up doing a presmog. Which they charged 25$ when the sign clearly stated 20$. The excuse was that it was a large vehicle. However being rude and telling me that the answer to my question of can you repair it so that it will pass was...

"Not without further testing and it will be too expensive for you."

It's funny how do they know what is or isn't in my budget. This is all after telling at 8am that the only person who could do it wouldn't be in until ten. I came back at ten and the man I spoke to at 8am was the man to do it.

Wouldn't sent anyone here unless they really like being treated badly.<//Review>

The worst. Reccomend avoiding, because your taking a strong risk they will try and scam you. Been here twice for smogs and some of the employees are terrible with customer service. Always one word answers, reluctance to fully explain things or problems, unfriendly. On the most recent test they full on swindled me because i had a check engine light on, and instead of honestly telling me that it wouldnt pass bc of the light on, they ran it anyways, failed, charged me and said id have to pay again for the recheck after getting the light off. When i brought up the issue with a manager after the recheck he only argued with me and tried to make up poor excuses for his technician just not even being honest in the first place. So yes they offer the cheapest smog test, but make sure ahead of time you're car is in perfect shape and will pass the first time, or they may look to pull the same move they did on me.  You're much better off going to another place that has quality service and will do a free retest. I also want to add that similar experiences have happened to both my parents.< /Review>

If you are planning for an oil change and just an oil change do not come here. They tell you a millions of things are wrong with your vehicle and tell you your alignment is off even if your vehicle is 2019. Would not recommend.</Text>

Wife came in to get a rear tire patched. Technician recommended a new tire for front driver side tire, due to bad wearing. Fine, she ended up paying for new tire and got that rear tire patched. Ends up they forgot to put back the hub cap for the rear patched up tire. They call her next day to have her go back to put on hub cap. She shows up and they couldn’t find it. Really..?? On top of that, a low tire pressure indicator came up. They ended up adding more air for one of the front tires.< /Text>

<Review>Initially I was happy with service purchased a set last year goodyear all terrain tires for my f150 went back a while ago to get my free rotation and front end alignment was informed they couldn't do the alignment because the tires were to big and the truck wouldn't fit on the rack so I had to go to find another place to rotate and align I went to Firestone on Washington no problems in an out in a hr pretty disappointing my family been using that tire shop for years but having to go to another shop for service ends that tradition<//Review>< pics>

These guys really let place go! No tires in the showroom and personal junk stored in the garage. Very odd and messy. As far as service not to sure, just needed a tire repair.

A while back, a mechanic here found something simple that the dealership kept missing. Great work for a fair price.</review>

Our floor was redone and the tires were store in our shop area, where I felt they belong. by tge way I remove the tires 3 years ago, wich means you havent visit my store in 3 years. I had order new furniture for my new floor  and a 2017 Hunter Aligner. The parquing lot was redone and we gave it a facelift. when you came we were under construction, but now my shop now looks like i wanted.\nPlease feel free to talk to me at any time, I am available for all my clients.\nHave a good day, and again I apologize for your inconvenience.'}</response>

{'time': 1499298186113, 'text': 'Silent?  I am sorry to hear you feel that way.\nWell Mr. Silent. No one remembers you, I have review my  computer data and interview  service personal. Maybe because you are using a nick name on your view.  My cell phone is listed on the counter for any questions and I am in the shop at all times, since my corporate office is there. I am a certified mechanic with 25 years of experience , " the girl" you mention it\'s a qualified person.  Lady\'s also can do a man\'s job, we can\'t deny that. Berenice is very educated and knowledgeable. For sure she knows the difference between oil grades, here is some info for you:\nThedifference between 10W-30\xa0and a 10W-40 is the high temperature viscosity. Obviously, a 10W-40 is thicker than a\xa010W-30\xa0at high temperature.\nI would love to meet you in person, feel free to contact me at : mandrgoodyearshop@yahoo.com'}</response>
<user>100082614344519614941< /user><review>Don't ever go there!
The girl at the counter has zero knowledge of cars and she is supposed to write up the service orders. She doesn't know the difference between 10w30 and WD40. It's a joke!!
I should have left when I noticed how incompetent she was, but I was in a time crunch and eventually the manager came and ... again, I should have left after talking to him, but I didn't.

I got an oil change done on my Sierra truck and all fluids toped off. After 200 miles the low coolant light comes on (it never came on in the 14 years I have owned it!) and another 300 miles later the low oil warning comes on!
I went back to ask for a top-off and was told that I probably had leaks and they needed to check the vehicle or charge me for the fluids.

I left and will never be back there. They now lost the tire business on our service fleet vehicles too because of the shady work they did on my personal vehicle!</review><Pics>None</Pics><user_name>Silent Epsilon< /user_name>< gmap_id>

You paid $179.58 with your Goodyear Credit card, because you declined to replace recomended brake rotors that were worped. and I have the invoice to prove it, wich I dont want make public.\nYou requested for us to do your front brakes and when they tryed to give you a estimate you stated "just do the job I am hungry and I have to go eat"  This is one of the reazons why you should get a stimate analize the price and than decide. before you authorize any work you should listen to the person who is trying to give you a estimate.\nThe estimate you were given of $332.47\nfor front brakes and 2 front rotors for a 2013 Ford F-150 pick up is a low conpetitive value price. If you shop around you will confirm that. of course if you do it your self it will be labor free.  But after  we inspected your rotors we found your rotors to be worped, since on your invoice that you signed you complained that your truck was shaking violently when you try to stop. we recomended your rotors to be replaced. You stated "just do the job"  you said you had to eat. but after you came back smelling like alcohol you were very agressive, yelling at the counter girl, wich I feel was un-necesesary since we can dialog with respect. I spoke to you  and we agree that we were gonna machine your old worped rotors and we refunded you back your money on your Goodyear Credit card, wich was $152.89.\nI am sorry that you couldn\'t afford to do your brakes properly.I helped you and refunded you the money for the rotors. and I did not charged you to re-installed your old rotors back on.\nThank you and you may coctact me at:\nmandrgoodyearshop@yahoo.com'}</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2d30e24834e03:0xaac6f8204c3e7380< /Gmap_id>< name>

<Text>(Translated by Google) In my opinion ... I do not give it a star ... my car was ruined last Monday, it was just a simple sensor in the engine ... I have another Goodyear workshop where I take it but due to the distance my car was not going to arrive and I decided to take it to this place ... they are extremely dishonest especially the one who claims to be the manager. a long-haired boy I don't remember the name I think it's Mario he charged me $ 120dls for a 15-minute job. and $ 120 for a piece that cost the most $ 80 dollars original of the brand of my car. I knew it because I took a second time to check my car but now to the place where they always fix it and it is extremely annoying to see that it no longer There are honest people ... this boy only told me that this is charged for doing that job and that the ones in the workshop where I take it were liars when they told me those prices ... I suggest to all the clients that before giving them a job find out the name of the piece oh pieces that will be changed to their cars and I will investigate the price first .... Q little honesty ... with that I have plenty to not recommend them to anyone ... ever.

En mi opinion..no le doy ninguna estrella..mi carro se arruino el lunes pasado era tan solo un simple sensor en el motor ..tengo otro taller Goodyear donde lo llevo pero por la distancia mi carro no hiba a llegar y decidi llevarlo a este lugar...son sumamente deshonestos en especial el q se dice ser el manager.un chico de pelo largo no recuerdo el nombre creo q es Mario me cobro $120dls por un trabajo de 15 min. y $120dls por una pieza q lo mas caro costaba $80dolares original de La marca de mi carro.Lo supe por q lleve por segunda vez a revisar mi carro pero ahora al lugar donde siempre me lo arreglan y es sumamente molesto ver q ya no existe gente honesta ..este chico solo me dijo q eso se cobra por hacer ese trabajo y q los del taller donde lo llevo eran mentirosos al decirme esos precios...Sugiero a todo los clientes q antes de darles un trabajo averiguar el nombre de la pieza oh piezas q se les cambiara a sus autos eh inveatigar el precio primero.... Q poca honestidad... con eso me sobra para no recomendarlos con nadie....nunca.< /Text>< Response>
{'time': 1525962094808, 'text': '(Translated by Google) Lady, I understand your situation, but as I explained to you, it is difficult for AutoZone to pay 103.49 plus the tax. We do not use that flat brand but it is an example. The work is not 15 minutes, it is an hour and a half, because you think you were here for more than 3 hours, if it only took 15 minutes for the job, I would tell the technician that he hurries so he can help me with another job. We do not charge you The diagnosis that took 1 an hour. Honesty is telling the truth, from the beginning we told you the correct diagnosis, the prices that are charged (Google searches that work is worth-almost $ 392). Looking for people who tell you what you want to hear is not honesty, and it hurts me that you think that we lied to you not because of the diagnosis or the quality of work.\n\n(Original)\nSeniora yo entiendo su situacion pero como te explice estas civocada, ese piesa cuesta a AutoZone 103.49 mas el tax. Ni usamos ese marca chafa pero es un ejemplo. El labor no es 15 minutos es un hora y media, porque piensas que estubistes aqui por mas de 3 hora, si solamente se tardara 15 minutos para el  trabajo obiamiente le digo al tecnico que se apura para que me puede ajudar con otro trabajo. Ni te cobramos El diagnostico que se tardo 1 una hora. Honestidad es decirle la verdad, desde El principio te dijemos el correcto diagnotico, los precios que se cobran (busca en Google que vale ese trabajo-casi $392). Buscando a personas que te dicen lo que queres oir no es honestidad, y me duele que piensas que te mientimos no por El diagnostico or El calidad de trabajo.'}< /Response>

The whole staffing is always so welcoming with smiles on their face. I went in super nervous but Everyone was so kind and made me feel super comfortable. I love to joke around and I am so happy they were not bothered by it one bit as many places are. The fact that Dr. Shah & Monica follow up on you even over the weekend is AMAZING! They are One call/text away if you have any questions or concerns  <3

It’s been about two weeks from my first procedure and I see some amazing results. Results that I never thought I would see. I’m already planning another visit in the future 😉<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>Aahhhh-mazing.. I love going to this spa, the girls are amazing and know what they are doing. It's so relaxing and they definitely make you feel comfortable. Monica is amazing and great at what she does, she will answer all you questions. I get my Brazilian laser hair removal with Jessica and she makes me feel so comfortable like I've known her forever and not awkward at all. I highly recommend this place, you will not regret it and they also have the best prices in town.< /review><pics>None</pics>< GmapID>

I have been going to Lux Medical Spa for about six years. I first came because of a Groupon. I stayed because of the great pricing and service. Everyone is always warm and welcoming. I was so impressed, I shared the excellent service and family like feeling that my sister travels all the way from Whittier to go to Lux.< /text>

<user>112922134679429700523<//user><Review>This business is the most difficult to deal with I've ever encountered.  It took me a few calls to setup an initial appointment.  Once I arrived, I was informed that I made an appointment with the wrong person based on what I needed (laser treatments) - as if I was to blame.  I'm not sure how they expect me to know who does what, so that was Strike 1 for me.  Strike 2 came when I finally did see the right person about a week later.  Her attitude was rather sharp and not focused at all on the customer - very self-centered.  She made me feel like I was inconveniencing her with my presence.

Still, after the quick skin test, I decided that I'd let them do the procedure sometime in January or February.  Since they were having a sale on gift cards during the month of December, I called the following week (week of Christmas) to find out when they'd be available, but no one answered or returned my voice message.  I tried again the following week and still got no answer.  On Wednesday (30 December) at around 2 p.m., I drove to their location to discover that they shut down for the rest of the year as of the afternoon of 29 December (the previous day).  There was no mention of this on their website or anywhere else.  They just decided to close shop without warning.  Strike 3.

Yet, I decided to call today to give them one more chance, but only if they would honor the gift card discount.  I called this morning around 10 and this afternoon at 4:30.  Still, no answer (they are showing to be open until 7 p.m.).  My advice is to not bother with these people.  If they are this difficult to reach, their quality of service can't be that good.  In any case, a very frustrating experience.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Sheena did an excellent job!  My dad needed a deep clean to his newly purchased home and Sheena and Rebecca did a great job getting to everything and got the place immaculate! Sheena was thoughtful and very detail oriented. She was extremely easy to communicate with and even pointed out some concerns of damages in the home the inspector missed. I am so happy to have found her and would definitely use her services again!</Review>

Sheena and Alexa were amazing! I appreciate the time they put in and can tell they care about song good work. Upon first meeting Sheena, I wanted to hire her because I like her character and she showed such empathy for my situation and offered solutions to help in areas of organization as well as cleaning! She's got a great thing going here and I'll have her back again very very soon!< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I was in a bind and needed a home deep cleaned and immediately and these ladies came through with far more than I expected.  The open communication and attention  to detail started from the minute they answered my call and ended with making sure I was satisfied with their services.  Going above and beyond they removed several years worth of pure yuck from a tenant which brought our stinky, dirty home back to the clean and cute home it is.  You will not be disappointed!!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<review>Sheena and her crew gave a through and professional cleaning that was military white glove level. Being in quarantine doesn't mean that you have the time or even the inclination to deep clean. Sheena is fair in her pricing and she's worth every cent. I liked her work so much that I've scheduled to be regular on her calendar  to ensure my house stays this way.</review></record></dataset><record>

So happy to work with Sheena for the first time.  She was able to clean my house the next day, was inquisitive about my cleaning needs and also identified needs I didn't originally see.  Gave me a peace of mind for getting rid of built up grime and killing germs before new baby arrives.< /review>

<Text>I was very impressed with the cleaning service I received from SD.ANNS. They tackled my dirty 3,000 sq ft home and transformed it into a shiny, clean spectacle. Sheena and her partner were very professional and friendly. Their price was very reasonable for the detail that they put into their work. I highly recommend this business for your house cleaning needs!< /Text>< pics>

SD Ann's house cleaning is great, they offer friendly reliable service, Always flexible to your schedules. My husband and I are both fulltime + working parents of three, myself also a fulltime student. SD Ann's cleaning has helped us so much in all out house cleaning needs including organization where needed.
I recommend for any house cleaning needs big or small.</text>

WOW!!!!! A GREAT SEAFOOD TRUCK - Mariscos Culichi is one of the best seafood truck in the valley. The shrimp tostada's and oyster's was unbelievable, had also tip them more.  The best thing was how reasonable the prices were. Can't wait to come back again!< /review>

Good food, fair prices. This is Mexican style seafood, in particular mostly shrimp, octopus, scallops, and oysters. Fair portion sizes for the price. Dont expect anything fancy, except for good food and fast service.</Review>

Great food! Fast service. Keep in mind at the end of the day this is a food truck, maybe not the best for toddlers and yes it’s on a busy street. However I knew this and none of this bothered us myself and my family. A group of 9 and they surrved is very quickly with some yummy and unique mariscos, tostadas and copteles were amazing!<//text>

<Review>We were looking to find some nachos in the area and, after seeing pictures online, we had to try them at Blackbook. The super nachos with carne asada were definitely at the top of my list of favorite nachos! The toppings were evenly spread and chips didn't get soggy. Only thing I would add next time is extra jalapenos because I can never get enough!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

We came here for late night food after a drag show nearby. Service was top notch. Even though they were busy, we still found seating for our group.

We ordered nachos and the grilled cheese. The nachos came out on a sheet tray with an entire pound of melted cheese goodness. The sauce is quite spicy though.

The grilled cheese.... out of this world. Three sandwich halves and loaded with cheese. That may be the best grilled cheese ever.</review>

Thursday night- Rude host and servers- Were more focused on their friends who kept walking past them than other paying customers. Can’t understand an establishment that turns away paying customers who show up 30 minutes before closing. We stood waiting for 10 minutes as host said I might be able to squeeze you in. Then he says sorry too busy. Hello? You either can or can’t. They obviously didn’t have a proper seating system in place. Terrible customer experience. In My view don’t go here unless you want hassle. Delighted my partner and I found somewhere else that had a delightful service.<//text>

<resp>None</resp><userid>115470235809499566564< /userid><Text>So pre pandemic this was our go to place for good food and great service... We have now been back three times since they reopened during the pandemic and tonight will be our last visit.
The chicken sandwich is still the best in the valley. However what used to also be the best nachos are now not... they are half the size and made differently.
Lastly and most importantly the service... I don’t know if they just had to hire all new people or what but it is just awful! Do yourself a favor and do takeout if you are craving their chicken sandwich.  For nachos now our go to will always be Tac/Quila. Sad day... Hopefully in a couple months we will try it again and be able to update this review.</Text>< username>

So so..... it's a small tight bar so always looks busy. First visit yesterday, food was ok never going to set the world alight. The menu needs more information and the rating of the Hot, Hotter and Devils Revenge are fairly inaccurate. We got a Chicken Sandwich at Devil Level and Wings at Hotter, and the wings were spicier. Good nachos though, however the chicken portion for $4 was bordering on criminal it was that small..... would we return, not really its expensive for not alot. Spoke to our server and he agreed regarding the heat levels of the spice too... Also one of our party has been ill for a couple of days after the food - not good.<//review>

Easily one of the best chicken sandwiches in  California, but I’m a little underwhelmed by the staff.

I’ve eaten here a number of times when visiting Palm Springs. I called around 2pm and was told the restaurant opened at 4, the first time after a lengthy closure during COVID lockdowns. Come 6pm, I gave them a ring, it went to voicemail. I tried two more times, then gave in and drove to the restaurant to order in-person.

We were confronted by a hostess who said that they were no longer doing takeout and that the wait for a table was roughly an hour and a half. It was a disappointment on our last night in Palm Springs. I wish I had been told during my initial phone call that Blackbook was no longer doing takeout. If I had known, I would have planned my night differently.

I’ll still return. Blackbook’s chicken sandwich are WAY TOO GOOD to resist!<//Review>

<user_id>100902982763931492879<//user_id><Rate>2<//Rate><response>None<//response><Text>Really disappointed in direction the bar appears to be going in. I'm a local for 3+ years and had been visiting this bar (typically) weekly with friends and spouse; it truly is/was a great place to connect for food and drink.  Most servers recognize us as well and know what our drink is - very "Cheers" like.  Fast forward to football Sunday and my crew of 5 came into the bar at 2:30 to watch the game, eat and drink.  Because the game didn't start until 3:30, we purposely held off on drinking alcohol, opting for sodas instead.  Likewise, we were not yet prepared to order food as we were waiting for 2 additional friends to join us.  A little background - the bar was not busy and there was plenty of open seating.  Previous week, we actually asked one of the bartenders whom is one that recognizes us and always is a joy to talk with, if we would have any issues getting a table; she stated no, that in the year prior, it wasn't as busy as most people opt for home parties.  Good enough for us and she was right!  Back to the issue though, prior to the game starting and our two additional friends showing up, the owner approached us telling us that we had to order something other than soda.  Rude as it was, we told him but of course, that was the game plan but his attitude really was uncalled for seeing he doesn't know us or how much we contribute to his success.  But, we eventually started ordering drinks as the game started, in addition to food.  We had a table of 7 people enjoying the game, not rowdy and certainly paying for the opportunity to be there.   Three of our friends, two of which (locals) are weekly patrons as well, left mid-game as the owner's approach truly didn't sit well with them considering how much they've spent over the year/months there.  Four of us remained and saw the game through to completion and continued to hang out drinking, laughing and yes, two of us were still eating.  Then, a waiter came up whom I didn't recognize asking if we were leaving as he had a couple of people that wanted to order food and sit down.  We were not even done with our drinks, let alone our friends with their food.  I can tell you I've been in BB many a time when there were no tables and just turned around and left recognizing it's a great place and I just got there late, oh well- never has a staff member asked if I wanted them to boot someone out so I could sit.  Obviously, the waiter who asked us if we were leaving left us alone after I sternly told him we're not even done yet.  But, his actions and that of the owner earlier was the last straw.  My husband, an HR Consultant for a Fortune 100 company, who manages his company's customer relations, approached the owner showing that we've (2 people) spent over $1,200 at BB since 11/04/19 via the bank app on our phone.  Not to mention, that night alone, we spent in addition to, $292.92...and that was just two of the 7 of us.  The owner apologized to my husband, so I give him that...in addition, he bought the four of us that remained our last round, so kudos to him for that too.  However, the apology was to only one of the 7 that were there that night.   As much as I love the establishment and the crew, I can't say we will be back anytime soon.  Our friend who happens to own a successful bar on the same street (unfortunately they don't serve food which is why we were not at his place) acknowledged profit is in the drinks, not the food, so he couldn't understand why the owner's actions were as they were.  Could have been an off night or perhaps the beginning of a trend - just if you go, order food and quickly in case the establishment wants to usurp you from the table.  And of course, have fun because all things considered, it is a great place to meet up.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80db1ba6a675e55f:0x65fe2e6507a944ab<//Gmap_id>< username>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Server waited on 2 tables that came in after we sat down before acknowledging us.   Walked by and tossed menus on the table at us and said "I'll be with you guys shortly".  After we ordered, he Brought us our drinks and I asked if they had straws.  He replied with "yes" and then stared at me.  I asked if they have straws (because some restaurants don't have have them in CA) and he replied "yes" and then silence.    I asked politely if we could have straws and he replied "what do you say when you ask for something".  He made me say "please" before giving me straws.  When he brought the straws to the table, I reached out to take the straws that he was firmly holding and told me to say "Thank you" before letting go.   That is poor customer service!   And I wasn't even being rude.  My friend then told him he was  being rude.   The server (Rob C. - beard and wearing a hat) replied stating that I was being rude.  My friend stated that I politely asked about straws that did not warrant his need to demand a please or thank you.  Additionally, he pointed out that the server was rude because he didn't greet us properly, tossed menus at our table and waited on 2 table that came in after us.   The server replied " well it's really busy tonight".   No...it was not that busy.  I've been to Black Book several times with this server and twice as busy as last night (2/13).   Worst experience at Black Book...which is one of my favorite places to eat in Palm Springs.  Also, this was my last time eating at BB before I move out of the area.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

After searching about for a decent cocktail on Google I decided to pop into what was closer and this was it. Great casual laid back vibe. It wasn't busy at all when I stopped in around 4pm. Ordered two old fashions and paid $21 so prices were reasonable and received the typical old fashion, not the best but typical and decent. I'd go again.< /Review>

Stopped in on a recommendation from a friend while we were in palm springs. This is a great LGBTQIA bar with delicious food and drinks. While a cocktail menu would be nice for us indecisive people, our server was great telling us what was available and making recommendations. My husband and I had the Juicy Lucy burger and the nachos, both of which were so good. Definitely get the nachos. Would definitely come back.< /review>

<review>Very busy during modernism week, and we took a look inside and determined there was no room, but the greeter and a waiter said, "We'll make room!" and they did. The place was packed but we got great service, and excellent food. The place was (extremely) lively and everyone was very friendly to the two obviously straight couples. They did not need our business but they went out of their way to accommodate us.< /review>< Rating>

This is a great bar with food and drinks. There is no drink menu, but they can make anything. Ordered an old fashioned and a Manhattan which were both made with fresh ingredients and a dark red cherry twist. Drinks are a good size and very reasonably priced around $10-12. The crowd here is friendly and a good age range.<//text>

< Review>
This bar needs a lesson in hospitality. The server and manager were very poorly trained and have no concept of proper customer service.

We were there as a group for 5 today. One person in our group had been to brunch previously and might have had a bit too much to drink. We ordered some food and waters and the rest of the group was planning to order drinks as usual. When the server returned to our table and I asked to order a drink he refused to serve our table based on one person that he perceived to be intoxicated. I had not had any prior interaction with this person.

I travel the world and frequent bars and restaurants regularly. I have never experienced such poor service as I did today.

I will never return to this establishment.</Review>

<text>The Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich is delicious but it might be too hot for some. You can order it without the sauce as well. I love the French fries and comeback sauce. The Chicken and Skirt Steak Tacos are both winners. The only real issue is the slow service. I've waited 45min to an hour sometimes just waiting for the food to come out on more than one occasion. I've heard other customers threaten to leave if their food doesn't come out in the next 5 min which I totally understand.<//text><username>Lee Kay<//username>< Rate>

It's always a great place to go food and a couple of drinks. BEWARE OF YOU FRENCH FRIES, it could be too much. The friendliness at this establishment is by far the greatest. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.<//Review>

Very good menu. Plenty for the price. The hot Nashville chicken sandwich was hot but not painfull but there are hotter versions for the bold. Fries are ample enough to share. Nachos are great and more than ample</review>

<text>Blackbook is a great inclusive bar and restaurant in the heart of LGBTQIA+ Palm Springs off Arenas Road. The food is amazing. My fav is the JuicyLucy Burger and the SuperDooper Nachos (easily shared between 4-6 people). The fries are massive orders, split then between 2 people. Drinks are great. Place gets crazy packed.< /text>< Name>

First time here. Loved the bar itself but the rest...wooden tables...just didn't fit the modern slick design of the bar area. Poor choice in my humble opinion.  Bartender was friendly and poured a good drink, which I appreciate!  My friends ordered a burger and fries each...both enjoyed their lunch. Waiter was attentive and friendly.< /text>

Just what the Dr. ordered.  Was a bit "out of sorts" for lunch spot today and ended up at Blackbook.  First visit.  Hamburger was perfect and filling.  Bartender was knowledgeable and efficient.  For those at the bar who wanted to "chat", he was a good and engaging conversationalist.  For those who just wanted a quiet drink or lunch--he arrived at the right time (filling water, getting check, etc.) but was not "intrusive".  All in all, I'll be going back again (and again).<//review>

< Review>
Beware there is a bartender here ripping people off!  Avoid the bartender with the handle bar mustache. This guy tried to rip me off on 2 separate occasions.

I love the hot chicken sandwich at this place because it's amazing. I frequent this spot pretty regularly as the food is good. I usually have no issues at at with every other staff member.

I'll start with last night. My partner and I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and 2 vodka lemonades on our way home from running errands. The bartender put in our order wrong and seemed unapologetic as he didn't even say something like "hey my bad" which would've been cool. So we get our bill in a shot glass as we were sitting at the bar. Our bill was about 42.00. I paid 25.00 cash and my partner put his card down for the remaining balance and tip.

He grabbed the glass and said "what are we doing guys?" You want the money towards the bill and rest on the card? We said "yes". He came back with a receipt for 16.62 and my partner signed it and tipped him. We get home and an alert pops up that he charged the entire bill to his card and pocketed my cash.

Another incident happens about 3 months ago when I gave him 60.00 on a 42 dollar tab. He asked me if I wanted change and I said "Yes, please" he not only didn't come back but went and took a break. When he returned he never came back to me so I asked someone else behind the bar if I could get my change? The handlebar mustache guy rolls his eyes and then gives me my change.

How many other people is this guy doing this to and why is this allowed to take place? This guy needs to be fired and should never be allowed around the cash register. Buyer beware and order from anyone else.</Review>

<Text>Black book bar has quickly taking his place among the cherished places of our gay community. The food is way above average, the staff is adequate, but there seems to be no heart here. Maybe with a little more time the warmth will appear and this new establishment will find its footing and begin to believe in itself.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>Always a good time.  Relaxed environment, great bar food (seriously, really good) and service is always top notch.  During the day it's a great meet-up place for drinks; typically able to get a table.  Night time, especially on the weekends, it gets packed so you may end up standing, but still a good time.  By far, my #1 choice for day drinking.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>It is really hard for me to write this review.  I have been a big fan of Blackbook since the day they opened.  I am local to the Palm Springs area and frequent this place every weekend spending about $50 plus per week for food and a few drinks.  We love the food, the bartenders and have developed great relationships with these folks. That all changed this past weekend when we had out of town guest come in for the weekend.  I took them to a drag brunch and then after that, said you need to check out this place for food. They have amazing service and food.  The 5 of us walked in and got a table and ordered​ the tray of Nachos along with 5 glasses of water​.  Everything seemed to​ be going fine until one of our friends asked for a drink.  That's​ when it started to go south.  The server, who he had no interaction with until then, said no, we will not serve you here.  We were all kind of surprised with that comment since he happened​ to be the only one that wanted a drink, and he was not drunk.  Two people in our party did not even have any cocktails before that.  After asking for a supervisor, a gal came over and had a conversation and I​ thought that it was resolved, and she proceeded with the food odor.  We still never got our water.  It was at that time that a security guard came over to our table and said you all have to leave.  I was shocked and embarrassed​.  I stepped into the conversation to find out why.  That did not go well either.  I was just trying to get an answer as to what happened.  he just got louder and louder and in my face to leave.  One of the gals that were​ with us, who had nothing to drink, came over to find out what was going on.  He would not discuss with me the reason.  WhenI​ I​ pointed out one of the bartenders at the end of the bar and tried to get his attention as he knows me​ from my weekly visits, someone else from behind the bar just stated in a very loud voice to LEAVE or I​ am calling the police.   At that time we left, with no answers as to what was the true reason.  I am a business professional and I know there are two sided to every story and I just wanted to have a discussion with someone that would listen since I​ was a weekly regular. I do not believe that we can set foot in this place again​​ unless an owner or manager reaches out to me to discuss​ and explain why the situation had escalated the way it did without​ even caring about the fact that we were very regular.  I am very sad about this as I​ truly loved the place and always recommend​ them to everyone we know.  That changes today.  Hope to hear from someone from your company.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Review below from D. Troemel, to add a little color to the review:
When I walked in, the manager was already having a conversation with them as I sat at the end of the same table.   I don't know the details, but i believe one or a number of them were intoxicated.  The manager was very cordial and was trying to resolve the issue. but the person in the below review wouldn't let her get in word in edgewise.  This person kept repeating, "I don't want to talk with someone at your level, I want to talk to the manager or owner."  The tone to the manager was incredibly condescending and all she was trying to do was to make this group happy.  It seems that when they refuse to allow the manager to do her job and nothing would make them happy, they were asked to leave.  But they wouldn't, they kept making a scene.  The bouncer had to continuously raise his voice and they finally listen, but one of the intoxicated person went to the bartenders asking for a business card over and over until he finally listen to the bouncer.
All I know is that the manager had a smile on her face and tried to resolve the issue.  She was bending over backwards and she was treated with disrespect over and over.
I love BlackBook and the staff.  They are truly wonderful people and I hope that the below review is taking with a grain of salt.< /Text>

Was there last night (Halloween). CRAZY busy. The staff, especially Aaron was amazing. Not stressed. Happy. Did a incredible job. The food (how I dont know considering the HUGE crowd) was beautifully presented, tasted GREAT and delivered very quickly. We shared Chicken and Carne Tacos and Fries. At least a dozen potatoes died for this basket!! Prefectly fried.  Would def go back. Cant imagine how GREAT it would be on a "normal" night.< /text>

<text>Decent ambiance, going for warehouse-chic I think. Interesting liquor selection, but they lack a few standards required for several classic cocktails. Seems like they're trying to emulate a craft cocktail bar, without actually doing any craft cocktails. Food is middle of the road.< /text><user>104711717559437339843<//user>< pics>

Customer service needs work. I LOVE gay bars. I go to them frequently in Phoenix.  My best friend is gay. But.. just because I am NOT gay don't treat me differently. We are all equal.< /Text>

I requested a server to the patio with the bartender as they had a full house inside..
About an hour now still no server with menu but he's come outside to bring out drinks and ask a couple of gentlemen next to me for anything else...
Maybe If i was a Male I'd get service like everyone else<//review>

Since its opening I've been stopping on weekly and enjoying their food, especially the nachos. The disco super fries are delicious. You might want at least 4 people to enjoy the larger portions with. On the healthier side are the salads. I recommend the purple kale with crispy quinoa. Hopefully they will find space to add more tables as this place is already gaining in popularity!<//Text>< response>

Top shelf liquor, great drinks and the most upscale bar on Arenas. Sophisticated and professional. Try the nachos -  one order is enough to feed 5 people. It's my favorite bar in the gay Mecca<//text>

<Review>This new addition to the Arenas gay bars is by far the best. You know why? The people who work there. By far the friendliest, most engaging of any of the gay bars. I love this place. It's my new favorite.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Name>

I can't say enough how great the food is here, its burgers, chicken, salads and taco's but the taste is WOW.  Nothing has disappointed.

The waite staff is spot on, and it has become a comfortable spot to hang out at.  Everybody makes you feel like you are special, like you are at your friendly neighborhood pub.  I'll admit my spouse and i eat here often, because we get to meet new people at the bar and the staff is spot on. Thanks Blackbook for making a new happy place!< /Text>

The owner is always friendly, funny, and attractive in the same uniform as everybody else: black shirt, and jeans of some sort.

Hand selected the menu items, based off of his own likes.

The drinks are crafted, and not thrown together with extra rubbing alcohol, like every other bar.

It's technically a restaurant, technically a bar, and technically gay, but not really.

The music is eclectic, and a Droid video of India plays on the screen whenever there isn't a muted, classic movie on.

I personally love the vegan sandwich called the "Conscientious Objector, which has the flavor of pulled pork, with the texture of meatloaf. Delish!

Overall, it's the best bar to ever open up on Arenas, and I hope it's success continues!</text>

Granted it was busy and the wait staff were stressed out, but when a customer asks you a question, you shouldn't be rude. Other than that, service was pretty good for it being busy. We got our drinks right away and the person at the door was friendly.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80db1ba6a675e55f:0x65fe2e6507a944ab</gmapID></record>

Went for lunch or more like early dinner with a couple of friends. We had a friendly and attentive server & way too much food. It was surprisingly delicious.

UPDATE: 03/09/2021

Although I will not detract stars, I have to say that the new vegan burger needs improvement. As it is really, really beany perhaps they should dress in like a torta  & add chopped lettuce, salsa, and guacamole. As it is now it is too dry and they offer no current condiment that would enhance the flavor but also keep it vegan.  Still a big fan or the venue though.</review>

Blackbook bar has a small menu I thank you for that. They have some very tasty foods. Be patient some times it take a bit of time for your food but that's ok have a drink or two make friends relax.
Blackbook is a small bar the kitchen is smaller. Again relax.<//review>

The food is delicious especially there large nachos & chicken sandwich. Its a friendly environment that we really enjoy but wish they had more reasonable drink prices.</Text>

The place was not too busy so we were excited to have a drink and a snack. The bartender, Carter, walked by us twice, stacked glasses, and studiously ignored us. Eventually, he did ask what we wanted to drink, but kind of reluctant, and then served us a couple of watered down cocktails. We asked for a menu, which he tossed at us and then never came back to take our order. It seemed deliberately rude so will not be back. And the drink was not very good nor priced well.< /Text>

<review>A few nice staff, but otherwise, most stand around, talk to each other, fiddle on their phones, and ignore you.  As others have said, an LA attitude bar that caters to the young and restless, not the majority of PS people.  Too bad.   $ 5 happy hour is nothing to brag about, its $ 2 across the street.  If you are from WeHo, you will love this place.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>Good happy hour drink deals, has simple food that sounded good but didn't order any, relaxed atmosphere.  Even indoor seating had feeling of almost being outside with large sliding wall of doors and not being a large bar. Mostly large tables to handle 6 people or more or a few smaller groups.< /Text>< Pics>

Once you wait 10 minutes to get the bartendars attention. You find drinks are made incorrectly and way over priced. Inconsistency with wait staff. No general system of working. Each staff person seems to work on their own schedule of service. No sense of ergency.<//review>

<Text>Best Moderne Bar in  Palm Springs with gireat looking bar tenders.  I'd go out with any of them on any night of the week.  The Decor is fabulous as well. Entertainment on big screens is unique & captivating Food & drink,💰💰prices are very reasonable.  Iny view Blackbiook is the #1 Gay Bar in rhe Desert.  Keep up the good work guys.✏️✏️< /Text>< pics>

Barbaric restaurant, very disorganized. On a busy day, patrons have to fight for table and seats to eat there. I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups.</review>

I really like this place, but the attitude from a couple of the bartenders (including whom I think is the owner) is just too much at times. I'll still go, but try to order from the tables only.< /text>

I was just told by a server that I "looked tired" in an incredibly mean, condescending way...never going back...just another pos gay bar in the desert...no different than the others, you only get decent service if they think you are "hot"</text>
