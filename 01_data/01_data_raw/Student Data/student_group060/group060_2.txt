<Review>Although an extremely busy establishment, I appreciate the quality of work and attentiveness they gave me. They made sure I had water to drink, and that the water for my pedicure was comfortable for me. I felt that the time spent on me was quality and I never felt they rushed. You must go with plenty of time and I would definitely recommend an appointment. I highly recommend them.</Review>< pics>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>I scheduled an appointment with them snd showed up on time, but still made me wait 10 minutes to be seen. Then I'm seen by someone who is also the one answering the phone and checking with everyone who enters the salon. He also had the tablet with the appointments on it next to him entire time he was working on my nails, so his attention seemed divided. Because he was multitasking and not focusing on my nails, his work seemed very rushed. The more I look at them, the more careless the work seems. The line work is really bad (see photos) and I don't feel at all this is worth the $65 I paid. :(< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5Lz1cyAE8SpughP5SN0ydmMoD-pntInbXw5Ot=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyuOL547jWylMPqVS7s38khrav4SmXLGnvq-64=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZX-_yZ8-FegHX7YwkJ-r0J-UcolxdgmrP4u4s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1zYWee5lpta26R8WcPJC0Kg7JNKmQUfo3hvmf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c34decb1af8001:0x7cfe0235c261b59d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Called Saturday to make an appointment for Sunday. Made an appointment for two pedicures. Our appointment was for Sunday at 10. They called to confirm our appointment. And got a text reminding me. (Loved that) arrived at our appointment time. They sat us down right away. Place is very clean and they have everyone sitting in every other chair. The massage chairs are wonderful and they have plexiglass in between you and the nail tech. Would definitely recommend this place. To get great service as for Jenny she did amazing. First time coming and will definitely be back!!</Text>

I sent an appointment request on yelp in the late evening. I wasn't expecting a reply because of the hour and I  was pleasantly surprised that I received one.  I got the #2 pedicure with Jenny and I enjoyed it very much. The employees were kind and I didn't feel like I was being rushed. The place was clean and welcoming. I'll be coming again.</text>

First time I’ve been here and I AM SO HAPPY!  I got a full set with a gel polish.
I showed my nail tech, Vivian, a picture of the shape and color and she gave me exactly what I wanted.
And the price was HALF of what I’ve paid for a full set at other places.
I am so pleased and will be a returning client</review>

First time coming here and I would come again . They do an amazing job. They are very polite and play attention to every detail to make sure you’re satisfied with their work. They are every cautious with the pandemic going on. I got a full set and a pedicure. I’m  very happy with how they turned out. I payed 22 for the gel pedicure and 50 for a full set i thought it was a little pricey I would if charged 40 for it I thought it was pretty simple. But overall amazing job.<//text>

< review>
The place of business was beautifully kept. The place was impecably clean and all the employees seemed to have excellent hygiene practice. Lucien had a huge selection of colors.  All the staff was very efficient on keeping services quick, but not rushed. Wonderful place of business and excellent in making you feel welcomed even if you were a last minute addition to their schedule.  Ladies you know how some nail salons make you feel like a pariya due to it either being your first time or a walkin-in? Well Lucien receptionist made me feel welcomed. I highly recommend! 👍</review>

Always tranquil and uncrowded on a Saturday morning during summer. When school is insession? Have sampled a number of the milk teas with boba and all have been good. The rose is, in my opinion, the best. Staff is courteous and helpful.< /Review>

<text>Excellent teas and milk teas. Great selection of boba and extras. Food is decent but a bit pricey for the selection. I would recommend going here for a boba tea drink and smoothies. Popcorn chicken is tasty as well.< /text>< rating>

<Review>Dirty environment. Last time I visited I couldn't help but be put off by the collection of filth under the equipment behind the register. While I witnessed employees doing there best to clean up spills they neglected to clean under the large metal equipment. I doubt their efforts could remove what looks like years of neglect. They'd probably have to replace the flooring to even remotely clean this area. Additionally the equipment the employees used looked filthy itself, concerning me over the true quality of cleanliness that their efforts could achieve in the areas they can reach to clean.

The place is always packed which surprises me as the quality of milk tea is lacking. I hear the chicken is good, but from what I've seen the product is nothing like what is advertised on the menu.

The boba itself is hit or miss, somedays it's perfect and others it's burnt. I'm not sure what they use in brewing the tea but I've become ill multiple times after consuming the product, once throwing up before I was able to leave the store having to run outside quickly to avoid causing another mess for the staff to clean.

My experience with the staff has been alright. They're often friendly. My order is usually what I place, except for one time in which a male staff member incorrectly prepared my order which I didn't notice till after I had already left.

With plenty of places in IV that have Boba I would absolutely recommend going elsewhere. The service is the only quality component at Wake Cup. Cleanliness and product are low quality, and advertisement on the menu is completely inaccurate.</Review>< pics>

Seems very hard to find good boba around here in Santa Barbara. Sadly, I felt the same way about Wake Cup. The drinks were pricy for the quality you're getting. Drinks were absolutely terrible. They use powdered flavoring and the boba itself doesn't cut it. Better luck finding decent bubble tea down south.</Text>

Do you think I am in a good mood? The milk tea tasted differently every time I drank the milk tea. Really speechless

说晚上十一点关门就不要提前关门好吗 finalweek大晚上跑过去发现你关门了你觉得我心情好吗 每次喝到的奶茶味道都不太一样 有一次珍珠全部坨在一起 根本吸不起来 我真的无语了</Review>< Pics>

All five stars over all because the nails were amazing so were the employees, they were so nice and sweet!! Loved this place definitely going back! Waited a couple mins before getting seated and since I was there with a friend they did our nails at the same time, took about two hours top but the amazingly crazy part is that it went by so fast it didn’t even feel like two hours because of their strategy used. Very smart and amazing and again definitely going back.< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>I tried to speak with the employees and manager about the charges they had and they said I would have to speak with each individual who did our nails.They have no records and will not produce a receipt for you upon request. How they’re maintaining their accounting records and reporting to the IRS, I have no idea. Honestly, if this establishment closes due to tax fraud, I wouldn’t be surprised.

They charged us $160 dollars and they didn’t want to give us a little extra lotion. Even after we tipped $5 per person who helped us. DEFINITELY not worth your money. It’d be cheaper for you to drive to LA, pay for gas, and get a quality spa day. Including the service. I got yelled at by two associates for asking to see what the break down was and for requesting a receipt. Basically, since I already paid, I wasn’t worth being treated like a customer any longer.

Ultimately, it’s just our fault for choosing this place. We won’t be going here again. I hope you find a place that treats you and your nails right.< /Review></record>

I’ve been going here for over a year and within time they’ve just got worse and worse. After the reopened after quarantine I went to get my nails done and within a week of having them every single one was broken. Will not go here ever again.</Review>

I waited for an hour and 20 min to get my color changed and they accepted someone who came in after me with no appointment. This place is cheap but really it's not worth the HORRIBLE service they provide. Their workers look unprofessional and make me feel uncomfortable with how they act in front of us. This will be the last time I come here.<//text>

Love this place.  Tina is wonderful with eyebrows and nail art but she usually has an appointment line up for the whole day.  Gina is who I have do my nails.  If you call in advanced you don't have a long wait and my nails always look great.  I always get complements.< /text>

Meh. I've had better manicures, and I've had worse. There are other places nearby that are more worth the money. I'm not saying don't go. Just saying to weigh your options.</Review>

<text>Went in for a gel pedicure and gel manicure. Asked for gel pedicure and got a regular polish, took forever, and a squiggly smile line. Pedicure didn't even last a week. My feet were red and itchy a few days after I had to use an anti fungal cream because I got athletes foot from the pedicure. Went and sat with another girl for my gel manicure. She shaved down my nails like she was doing acrylics which is a NO NO. I asked for French tip and it looked like a small child did the smile line or someone with Parkinson's did my nails. I ended up with an easier designthe girl could do.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I went with my 10 yr old daughter to get a manicure with gel color and a pedicure with gel color and for myself a pedicure with gel color. 3 different people did our nails...The man who did my daughters manicure did a great job (friendly and took his time), the lady who did her pedicure took 5 minutes with just a single coat plus didnt put her feet under UV light instead put a small fan only and her nails begin to crack instantly and I told her she just fixed one so I kept pointing out the rest and she just ignored me. I was so upset because I expected her to do a job I paid for instead I get cracked/chipped and thin layer look. That Lady is just for the money and has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE by ignoring us paying customers. Then she kept telling my daughter stop touching your feet together as if that would ruin the POOR JOB she already did right when we were paying. Gel nails are supposed to be dry and smudge proof!!!!!<//Text>

This place sucks, I went in on Thursday for a full set, I asked for black gel polish,  the lady didn't polish my nails right and my Monday the color started chipping. One nail broke 3 days after I got them done. These people don't do nails like they used to, it's like they don't care about the customer or the nail job just the money. I won't be returning.< /Text>

Cute, cozy sushi place. If you're looking for fancy this is not the place for you. Food was good. I got the shrimp & vegetable tempura it teriyaki beef, came with rice and miso soup so it was a lot of food for just me. My SO got California roll with baked scallops on top and a baked Philly roll. He said they were just good nothing wow about them. Garlic mussels were good.</text>

Appears to be a family owned, small cozy place. Sushi is wonderful & well made. Not expensive for sushi, great value as it's very good. Went twice, late evening we had place to ourselves during weekdays. Highly recommend<//Text>

Best Japanese food in the Coachella Valley. Probably the only REAL Japanese restaurant with the authentic tastes of Japan.<//Text>

Delicious fresh tasting food and reasonable pricing.  Comfortable and homey environment.  The place was empty when we went.  Service may be slow on a busy night.  Hope that all my future experiences are as good as this one.  Definitely recommended!!!< /Text>

My husband and I looked for a traditional type of Japanese Restaurant and found Tanpopo on Yelp plus it was close to our resort.   Glad we did excellent food and such a sweet lady whom was our server.  My hubby is an expert on Nabeyaki Udon and this restaurant has some of the best.  Come by for a wonderful meal< /Text>

This spot is tucked into a corner but we were very pleased with our meal. The interior is unassuming but quiet and we enjoyed an unhurried meal that was excellent. Great surprise, the prices were very good.<//Text>

This Mom and Pop Japanese Restaurant and
their ample and fresh fish keep me coming in at least once a week. They make you feel like a family member that dropped by for dinner.
Reminds me of the Japanese restaurants back in Hawaii where all us locals felt at home and
loved the food served. Plus, that movie Tanpopo
is in my all-time faves film list! Go enjoy this excellent traditional yet casual Japanese eatery.
Just please leave me some fish too!< /text>

< Review>
This was the surprise of the year.  From the outside Tanpopo looks liked nothing. The inside  is also modest, so you wonder about the food. Do not wonder ..this is some of the best Japanese food
I have ever eaten...and I am fussy. The Sushi was divine, the Tempura perfect, the  salmon steak so good you could not help but eat the entire portion. This is a  a must  for lovers of great  food, service that is not theming with tourists .<//Review>

Disappointed. The edemame was good. The yakitori seemed like microwave frozen chicken on a skewer with teriyaki sauce poured on. The dinners seemed okay like on the level of Yoshinoya. The broccoli spears were huge. Less prep time I guess but how do you eat it with chopsticks and no knife?</Text>

My kids just started Sparring and they love it!  My daughter was very timid and we really wanted her to learn Self Defense, her brother just came to watch but we ended up joining both.  We love that they're learning Korean at the school, too. 5/5</text>

My kids (ages 4 and 5.5) started the Tiny Tigers program 6 months ago and it has been a godsend!  Master Kim has taught my kids how to self control and given them strong confidence.  Highly recommend!< /Review>

<Text>We have been enjoying Master Kim’s TKD Academy for 6 months now - his classes are fun and he always is able to give attention to each student.  He is patient and shares useful knowledge when teaching.  He instills discipline, confidence and focus - my boys are always excited for every class. Ms Shannon is helpful and very responsive to questions.  The class schedule is flexible with different day/time options and changes every few months - even if we miss a class we easily can make it up.<//Text>< user>

Master Kim is very patient with the kids and has the perfect balance of fun and strictness. Mrs. Shannon is also always very friendly and ready to answer any questions.  The place is always clean and there are plenty of seats for parents to watch.  I highly recommend Master Kim's Taekwondo Academy!<//Text><Resp>None<//Resp><Date>1583975348396<//Date><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Name>

First the logistics. Master Kim’s Taekwondo Academy is conveniently located in East Dublin. There is lots of parking. The Dojang is CLEAN (doesn’t smell like sweaty kids).  There is lots of seating for parents to watch during class. Great for me because I spend almost three hours a week here for my two kids. Oh, and it’s steps away from a Starbucks and lots of places to eat.

Master Kim’s teaching is patient but firm. He keeps it fun (who wouldn’t want to spar with t-Rex dinosaur head) and incorporates Korean words and counting. He teaches respect, focus, and confidence, teamwork, and many other things. My kids have fun learning and have so much more self-discipline than before joining.< /text>

He teaches the classes himself and sets high expectations for his students. He also focuses on character development which I love. Students get plenty of opportunity to play, run and practice skills, even the younger kids train and practice the little nuances of the art. Master Kim's is an excellent place for your child if you want to learn this serious art in a fun and engaging way.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

My 11 yr old son started Taekwondo with Master Kim 6 months ago, and I could not be happier with how well he has done. He loves going to Taekwondo and has excelled in it. Master Kim is very patient with the kids and makes it a fun loving class. You can see how much the kids enjoy it. I highly recommend this place.< /text>

My daughter Jenna has been going to Master Kim’s academy for 2 and a half years now and has never been so happy with Master Kim. She has met several friends and enjoys learning discipline and self defense. I would recommend his academy to anyone. Master Kim is also very fun with the kids and plays some awesome Korean music to get the kids pumped up.< /Review>

Master Kim is a very dedicated teacher.  His positivity and energy motivates everyone to do their best. The days my son has Taekwondo class are his best days of the week. He always looks forward to going to MKTA. Ms. Shannon provides help and guidance to children when needed. She welcomes parents with a great smile and is always there to answer any questions!</review>

As a black belt personally, the moment i visited Master Kim’s Academy and saw Master Kim’s skill set, I knew this was the school I was going to put my daughter in.

My daughter started as a white belt few years back and now she is few months away from getting her BLACK belt.  Master Kim is excellent with kids and teaches strong conditioning.  In addition, he takes time to focus on building his students character & confidence and this is exactly what I’m looking for my 8 year old daughter.<//review>

There's such a great community here! Master Kim is particularly skilled with children and really knows how to impart lessons of discipline through martial arts. My daughter has been here for 7 months, and this is honestly the one activity she does that I can say has made the largest positive impact on her overall behavior.<//Review>

I go to Master Kim's Taekwondo two times a week and highly enjoy it! I look forward to going there every week! I have seen my growth in confidence, discipline and power. We do a variety of different activities such as warm ups, Poomsaes, Games, and Board Breaking. I have been going for about 8 months and have noticed how encouraging and patient Master Kim is with us. He is always spending his time with every student to help them use their best potential. I would highly recommend people of all ages to go to Master Kim's Taekwondo Academy to learn how to fight and defend themselves.<//review>

<Review>Jason and Tyler have tried other martial arts schools in Dublin and I myself took judo during summer in SF. These were good schools but they lacked something MKTA has, an instructor that’s fun which makes the class fun. At first my boys didn’t want to try another martial arts school but after a couple classes, they wanted to continue. As a parent, I do like the way Master Kim teaches. I highly recommend MKTA.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1555556508495</Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I highly recommend Master Kim’s Taekwondo Academy.  Master Kim is an excellent teacher and great with kids.  Our little girl joined class when she was just about 4 years old.  He was very patient with our daughter and made the Tiny Tigers class fun.  Throughout the months, we noticed a huge change in our daughter’s focus and confidence. She was excited to attend class every time and learned so much.  His classes are very interactive and high energy.  Ms. Shannon was so pleasant as well and always made sure we were accommodated for make-up classes.  Unfortunately we had to move out of the area due to a job transfer and we were sad to pull her out of class. He taught our little one so much in the year she attended.  She loved it so much and will continue with Taekwondo in the Monterey Bay Area.  Thank you for everything Master Kim and Ms. Shannon.  You’ll be missed.  We only hope our daughter’s next master is a fraction of what you are.</Text>< GmapID>

Master Kim's Taekwondo Academy is super fun. We get to learn Korean words and play fun games. We get to learn new things and we get to learn new kicks and break boards. I have really improved in taekwondo after I joined this taekwondo academy.< /review>

<Name>Njushena< /Name><rating>1<//rating><review>We are very disappointed with our experience with the school.

My son's advanced belt (red with a black stripe) was taken away without any clear explanation. Instead he was given a white belt. A white belt after 4 years in Taekwondo! I emailed to the school asking to meet with Master Kim to discuss the issue. The request was declined with the words that Master Kim was not available for discussions.
In her email Mrs. Shannon stated that "Master Kim explained to all of the students at the beginning of class today, that if they are unable to perform at their belt level they will lose their belt.  If your son is confused he can check the Belt curriculum for what are the requirements for Red Advanced Belt.". That did not make sense neither to me nor to my son. He had always performed at maximum at Master Kim's classes. He had not had any discipline problems.

My son received the Red Advanced belt at Master Kim’s back in January 2017. Since then he's got about 15 black and red rewarding tapes on his belt, - that proves his diligence, not the opposite.
After the issue with the belt we made a decision to cancel our membership with MKTA. At the end of the last class I asked Shannon to return my son's belt. She refused to give it back saying that he had to regain the belt, despite she knew that was our last class with the school.

Not just for years of tuition, we have also paid fees for all the belt tests... only to end up with the white belt again. And no, we haven't gotten any money back.

After years at MKTA what value have we got for our money? Looks like NONE!
And if Master Kim is saying my son deserves only the white belt after 4 years at his school, isn't that Master Kim's failure?

You might ask, where are all these kids from the video that plays on the screen in the school’s window? - They all left and went to other schools! So did we...<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><time>1542613417043< /time><resp>{'time': 1542746969436, 'text': "We are sorry to hear your experience at MKTA was not top notch.

I go to Master Kim's Taekwondo Academy and love going there. Master Kim is so patient and encouraging. He makes sure to spend time with each student to help them use their bast potential. In class we do many activities. Some of them are Poomsaes (which are the forms taught in Taekwondo),  Board Breaking (when we break a board), Games, and Warm ups (like Push ups, Burpees, etc.). I have seen a big improvement in my discipline, focus and power. I would highly recommend people of all ages to go to this Taekwondo Academy to learn to fight and defend themselves.<//review>

<text>My 7 year old daughter has been attending Master Kim’s Taekwondo Academy for a year now.  I highly recommend Master Kim’s TKD Academy!!

After a year, my daughter continues to look forward to coming to the classes every week.  Master Kim focuses on teaching the students the TKD’s firm, focus, confidence and the respect in a fun,  caring and entertaining way.  Master Kim has  a great ability to keep the student disciplined during the class.  I really appreciate his effort to help build my daughter’s confidence, strength, responsibility, respect and discipline.   Master Kim also will spend extra minutes to help the students struggling by providing positive encouragement. My daughter has gained strength and endurance from all the workouts. He has formulated the classes plans so well that all the exercises they are doing is FUN for them while they sweat!!!

The class schedule works wonderfully for working parents having to commute far.

I am very satisfied with this Taekwondo Academy. I recommend anyone who wants to try out TKD to bring your kid or yourself to try the free class out to experience yourself.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1573192402012, 'text': "Thank you for your review.

Master Kim is very good at teaching sparring. He has made many players national champions and is a great leader. I would like to tell many people who visit Kim's Taekwondo academy tour that it is a good choice.< /review>

Our daughter, Hayden, has progressed tremendously in confidence and assertiveness since joining MKTA.  Master Kim teaches the kids life skills on top of Tae Kwon Do, skills that will benefit her for the rest of her life.  I highly recommend MKTA.</review>

Master Kim is very patient with young children.

He is without any doubt one of the best Taekwondo Masters in the east Bay Area.</Text>

My daughter has learned so much in the time she has been with MKTA not just Taekwondo skills but leadership and confidence . Sometimes I think how strong and brave these kids have to be to get up and test for each belt in front of everyone . All in all it is growth and confidence mixed with lots of dedication . I’m glad she did it  here at MKTA  from white belt to black !</text>< pics>

Because of this taekwondo academy I have improved in being more confident with everything and I have improved in having more self discipline. We learned how to do Poomsaes, how to step in sparring, and we always play fun Korean taekwondo games. This is why you should join Master Kim's Taekwondo Academy.<//text>< user_id>

Over the last years I’ve taken my niece to Master Kim’s Tae Kwon Do school many times . During practice I’ve watched them break boards , meditate , work as a team , practice blocks and forms . I like the way Master Kim interacts with his students . The kids at his school look up to him and he gives them lots of confidence to face things in and out of just TKD .</text>

< Review>
I admire the values and benefits Taekwondo can offer to people and Master Kim by far is a true representation of these values!

Not only he is a real Master of the TKD skills but his passion and dedication motivated me to join his Adult class after watching my 2 kids for few weeks!

I have done TKD many years ago and I'm telling you look no more if you really want a professional and real TKD training, and as a bonus, the Academy offer some sort of specials for family members!< /Review>

Good pizza and nice interior setup feels like little Italian town inside. Pizza was medium crunchy crust with grilled cheese on rim. Overall taste was ok, above average but wouldn’t call it top in town, was little oily and dry. Chicken strips overcooked and leathery, don’t get them. Pleasant staff.<//Text>

<Text>This is the only pizza delivery available in Santa Luz area. A long way and they charge for it. But the pizza is good. Salads are great just a lot of dough that needs to be cooked a little longer. But that's par for American pizza places. Most people complain that a properly cooked pizza is "burned". Anyway going to call them tonight because they will deliver. Not cheap but good</Text><resp>None< /resp><user>115880918224992705976</user><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmap_id>

The restaurant is beautifully painted with Italian murals inside And there is outside dining tables as well. The food is great and their minestrone is exactly what I love when I’m under the weather.< /review>

Yeah yeah, sometimes they mess up your orders, sometimes it’s a little burnt but that’s fine my dad loves burnt food( I don’t know why) But I totally do recommend this they have not delivered a bad pizza ever to me. So I can obviously see that it’s pretty rare to get a bad pizza. I love Leucadia pizza.</Text>< pictures>

For BEST service DINE IN, as you may very well receive a
COLD-SPONGY pizza when DELIVERED. I've patronized here with family and friends on many occasions. Seems like the pizza flavor is more sugary than before. Atmosphere is great for post-game.</Text>

Thanks Leucadia Pizzeria for charging me $50 for this slop!  Extremely soggy and pricey pizza. Apparently the driver needs training.  We were disappointed  the first time we tried them but decided to give them a second chance.......never again!</review>

Decent Pizza. But one of their drivers almost ran me off the road last week when I was on my bike. I was already on the shoulder. They should tell their drivers to respect the rules of the road. I will never eat here again, and make sure to tell my friends the same.<//Review>

<Review>If I could give zero stars that would be more fitting. After spending over $30 for a two topping pizza we were delivered an unacceptable pizza. It was burnt and the toppings dry to a crisp. We ordered through Uber and were told it was not Leucadia’s responsibility and to talk to Uber. Evidently quality control does not exist at this restaurant. I spoke to a manager who was unable to provide a refund. They did offer to send another pizza but it took over an hour for the first delivery and they clearly don’t monitor the quality of their product before putting it in the box.< /Review>< pics>

We asked to ensure that they use a separate water for our daughter's gluten-free pasta, as boiling it in the same water as gluten-filled pasta can make her sick.  After a couple of minutes, the server returned to inform us that the manager refused to change out the water because "they were too busy" with the restaurant less than half-full at 5:45 pm on a Friday night.

<Text>This is our go to spot for ordering pizza. You can do online orders and they usually come within 40 min. I love their quality food and service. We typically get the Hawaiian pizza which is different than other Hawaiian pizza since they sprinkle it with cinnamon and it makes a difference. We also get the roasted chicken salad with the blush vinaigrette. Their salad sizes are generous and their pizzas range from individual to XL and are customizable.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dc083606c5a149:0x918bc66c73ed0b3< /gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pictures>

Food is so so.. prices seem a bit high. If you eat on in their outdoor area the noise from traffic and the train tracks is unbearable.

I only eat there when someone else is buying.<//Text>

This review is of Dr. Aguliar in response to treatment my son received for a shoulder injury..

Quick and focused response to the injury.  Had an immediate plan for treatment and follow-up appoinments in place to check on status of PT and injury.  His understanding of athletes and athletic injuries is valuable.</review>

I have been going to MemorialCare Medical Group for quite a few years.  Dr. Clamon Vu is my PCP.  I like him because he listens carefully and is kind and caring.  I never feel rushed.  He take the time to addrss all issues.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Lupe is the best phlebotomist ever.  I shy away from needles of any kind, but she is so gentle I hardly notice.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Dr.Vu has excellent “zoom”
side manner and bed side manner when I have met him at the office. In a large practice like memorial medical group visits can be close together and I have had other doctors who seem rushed and don’t seem to remember me even though I have been going to the office for years. Over my time at memorial Dr.Vu is one 2 doctors (other is Dr. Newman) I have really felt comfortable with and who I would recommend to others. Dr. VU always comes across very relaxed and ready to
listen which I feel like is important for connecting to your patients. He intently listens and I feel like he genuinely cares. I can’t praise this level care enough because it’s hard to come by and it’s truly can save lives and better the health of the individuals he cares for! Thanks Dr.Vu!</review>< Pics>

I have seen 3 different doctors, they are all fantastic and take time to explain what is going on with you. The front office staff is great and helpful as well. It is clean, new, and I enjoy going there. Appointments are easy to make, usually great availability and very accomodating. Love this place!< /text>

The team at MemorialCare is great.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  My primary care physician, Dr Aguilar seems genuinely interested in maintaining my overall health.  He discussed the limitations of my previous shingles vaccination and suggested the newer, more effective version which has been ordered.  During my appointments he does not seem to be rushed and seems willing to answer any questions.  He is professional and polite.</review>

My wife and I appreciate the Memorial Care medical professionals and Dr. Clamon Vu is no exception. We have known Dr. Vu for years now and he is yet another member of a great team with experience that shows. We also like the spacious layout and contemporary design of Dr. Vu’s facility. It’s the kind of “Doctor’s office” we enjoy traveling to.<//review>

< review>
I came to the office today for a TB skin test.  Full disclosure: English is not my first language (and my husband is helping me write this review).

Short version:  I wish I could give 0 stars for Dr. Masoud Mehraban.  He was the most arrogant and rude person I have ever interacted with.

Long version:  After being called back, a nurse (I think named Marge) was very patient with me and explained several times why I needed a chest x-ray instead of just a TB skin test like I thought.  Then when Dr. Mehraban came in, he asked perhaps the same questions but in a different way.  When I did not understand right away, he became irate and and started yelling at me.  "DO. YOU. UNDERSTAND. WHAT. I'M. SAYING?"  His voice was loud enough to carry through the whole office and the door to the examination room was open.  I was totally shocked by his lack of professionalism.  I didn't know what to say.  Since he has a slight accent, I can only assume that he is also an immigrant to this country, but his arrogance and rudeness were unforgivable.  Please avoid Dr. Mehraban at all costs.

Some free advice for Dr. Mehraban:  If you say the same thing three times progressively louder and a patient still does not understand, try saying it a different way.  Think about how you would feel if you went to a country where you did not speak the language fluently.</review>

Dan from Anytime Septic Service was extremely helpful. Although they do not service our area of the county, he was kind enough to speak with me on the phone at length and help me with some good, honest advice. This shows character for a business to spend time with someone, knowing they won’t make money off the call. Much appreciated Dan!<//Text>

From the first call to Anytime Septic Service to when the pumping and service of my and my neighbor's septic tanks was completed and their truck drove away the experience was totally awesome and professional. They were recommended by a neighbor who had a similar excellent experience. It is great to work with a company that values providing excellent service and excellent communication.<//text>

<Review>Our septic system was backed-up.  I referenced the BBB office in San Diego to find the appropriate organization to correct the problem.  The FIRST septic company listed was "Anytime Septic System Inc.", which was rated A+.  I telephone the company to arrange for an appointment to determine the needs of the system.  The appointment was arranged for the next day.  When the person arrived, we had a discussion on what the problems were, and, what should be done.  My wife and I had a very interesting schooling on the properties of the system, and, what steps might be necessary to have performed.  As the work started, the lids to the two septic tube collapsed as they were being removed for observation.  Both of the tubes were cleaned.  My wife and I were advised to contact a septic engineer to have the repairs made, that were needed.  It was a GREAT session\.  I recommend Anytime Septic Service for any septic problems.<//Review>< Name>

Javier was our service provider today & I cannot express how great his customer service was. He was informative, kind, and educated beyond expectations.  Based solely on Javier’s customer service, this will absolutely be a company that I use for the indefinite future. He made a “shitty” situation, quite positive.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Let me start off by saying that Anytime Septic Service is unmatched is customer service and professionalism. I called up Anytime Septic after combing through their online reputation. The services I was looking for were a Septic Pump and Inspection. I didn't get an answer when I called, but I left a message and got a call back shortly after.

Dan was incredibly pleasant on the phone, was quick to give me details and pricing, then got me set up with a service appointment a couple days out. When my appointment rolled around, Dan and his apprentice were 5-10 minutes early (on time) and quick to get to work. Both men were very professional and nice.

I had the opportunity to talk with Dan fairly extensively – without pulling him too much from his work – and learn about the history of Anytime Septic Service. He was also very informative about the physical and biological processes of a septic tank, which was great to learn about.

I couldn't recommend Anytime Septic Service enough – great experience from start to finish. They even pumped the septic tank for my in-laws' house next door the same morning, and provided a small discount for the twofer.  My in-laws mentioned they will never call another septic company again, and I completely agree.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

We have used this company for years to empty our septic tank. They have always been responsive to any concerns I have and they are knowledgeable about the best way to maintain our septic system. Everyone at the company is very pleasant to deal with. When we needed new leach lines installed, they had quality recommendations for a company that provides that service. We will continue to choose Anytime Septic.< /Review>

I called Anytime Septic because our septic system was backing up. Other places I called said they wouldn't be able to send someone out until the next day, which obviously wasn't going to work for our situation. But, true to their name, Anytime, said they could have someone here in just a few hours. I recieved multiple text message updates reporting everything that was happening along the way. Jesus showed up promptly within the promised time range and got right to work. He resolved our issue and was very thorough in checking that everything was in perfect order, working into the darkness to finish the job.  I'm extremely pleased with every aspect of the service from Anytime and will not hesitate to recommend them or use them again. In fact, they are coming back in a couple of days to install risers so the tank will be much easier to service in the future. It's great to know there are still companies out there that really care about customer service and it shows in everything they do. Thank you, Anytime!</text>

He also made several great suggestion for repair work and was very knowledgeable about the business. Dan was a pleasure to talk with and I will certainly call him back in the future.

Dan was easy to get ahold of, answered all of my questions, did not push unwanted or unneeded services. No hassle, straight to the point and got the job done quickly!  Highly recommend! Many thanks from Pine Valley!< /text>

I used Anytime Septic Service when I sold my house in Alpine. Great service and a very quick response. Once we opened escrow there was a small window to have the tank pumped and certified. Anytime Septic was there to help. Price was very reasonable as well. I will be calling them again when I need my tank pumped.< /Review>

<Text>I called Anytime Septic on a Saturday with a septic problem. Dan was so great, he answered questions had me check a few things and had me send him pictures of the inside of the septic system. He talked to me on the phone several times with suggestions and reassurance that we could make it until Monday to save weekend charges. He arrived early on the day scheduled and was super to work with. I thought I knew about septic systems, but his patience and answering of questions taught me so much that I didn't know! What a combination, he is an efficient worker that thinks outside of the box to solve problems and a genuinely nice guy to boot! Thanks Dan!</Text><Rating>5< /Rating>< resp>

Very nice,  very clean.  Quick,  and everyone really listened to me.  Plus the nurse showed me all my vitals and told me exactly what she was doing without me asking which I love.  Everyone was really great.  10/10 great experience.</text>

Went to the new Hoag Urgent Care in Foothill Ranch today after having taken a nasty fall.  The facility, staff, and care are all first class, state of the art. They were able to do the exam,  testing, x Ray, and Radioligist review all on-site. HOAG is definitely a class act!</Text>

So happy with the staffs knowledge, helpfulness, customer service and friendliness.

What a Team Hoag has here.

Thank you for your front line service during the pandemic.

<Review>I don’t like to leave negative reviews but I just need someone to contact me back to help fix the issue .

Hoag sent my bill to collections without ever notifying me that I had an outstanding balance.

When I contacted Hoag they said it was because I gave them the wrong address. I asked them what address they had on file for me and it was indeed incorrect. Then I asked them to pull up my the original form I had filled out .... and whoops it looks like they inputted my address wrong into their system from my form...

They said they will fix it. I asked what my balance was and I paid it on the spot and asked for confirmation. They promised me they would take my account out of collections since it was their fault and that my balance was paid in full.

I’m still getting calls from collections saying I owe the same balance from Hoag hospital. My credit score dropped.

I’ve tried contacting Hoag’s billing dept at foothill ranch for the last three weeks without any responses. Only automated voice machine. I’ve tried leaving three messages with my full information and have not received any response.

It’s frustrating because I was sent to collections on behalf of their mistake and I’m left to fix it without their help. I just need someone to contact me back to fix this.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Nightmare experience. Even though I loved Dr Valadez in the family practice, my experience with Hoag urgent care in Foothill Ranch makes me hesitant to ever go to a Hoag facility again. Certainly not the quality experience you receive in the Newport Beach offices.  Unqualified personnel that really don’t care about the patient.<//Review>< resp>

Been there twice, each time long wait, though hardly any patients.. last time made a reservation, but still ended up waiting for two hours.  They send samples for culture but never got back to me with results/adjusted antibiotics.  Got an antibiotic which didn’t work, called in to ask about a different antibiotic, was told I’d have to come in again and get evaluated.  It’s been 5 days.. and the original problem didn’t go away.  Not sure what’s there to evaluate other than they want repeat billing.  I was reluctant to go in and spend another 2-3 hours on the weekend just for a different antibiotic script, but was told that reservations don’t mean much, if someone else’s symptoms trump yours, you’ll be waiting regardless of when you got there.  And, the cherry on top - they don’t have doctors there, only PA.  Which is probably why I’m having this problem in the first place.   You’d be better off going to a first come first serve place, with an actual MD on staff.  In my case, it was simpler to wait till Monday and go to a regular doctor.</text>

I had a great experience at Hoag’s urgent care in Foothill Ranch!  From the greeter at the door to the woman who registered me and the medical team that saw me, all were friendly, kind, and caring.  I brought my child here last month, and we had the same great experience!< /text>

<review>Hoag Urgent Care at Foothill Ranch very professional and quick. At the time I needed medical attention, there was no waiting line and I was seen within 20 minutes. My wound required stitches which were professionally applied, with follow up prescription at the local pharmacy. Follow up care in 14 days to remove stitches. Staff very professional and quickly attended to the wound< /review>< Response>

<Review>The appointment in itself was great, I went for a Covid test and this was the only place that I could get an appointment on the same day. I showed up prior to my check in time and called the number and was told somebody would be out to my car after they finished with the patient that they were checking in. That took 20 minutes, but I understand that they’re busy. They took my insurance card & CDL & waited for a phone call. Then I got a nurse to come out and take my vitals and then give me the COVID  test. I opted for the fast result test but since they weren’t coming out it should’ve said that you could leave after giving you the test. Instead I sat in the parking lot so all in all it took me almost 2 hours to get my test results. I did test positive. The staff was very knowledgeable & I understand that it’s not easy to have to do car visits so I am very grateful to them.< /Review>< rate>

This was our second trip to Hoag Urgent Care Foothill Ranch.

I was able to make a same day appointment online, and fill out all necessary new patient information online as well - extremely easy and efficient.

On this occasion, my husband had fallen and his hand was injured in the fall.  Not being able to go in with him to Hoag (because of Covid19) I was concerned that all of MY WIFE questions and concerns wouldn’t get addressed.

I need not have worried, they took good care to Xray the hand to make absolutely sure no bones had been broken.  Proper care instructions were reviewed with my husband and pain prescription provided.

On my last visit, I provided a five-star review.  I’m most glad to provide another five-star review on this occasion, and most glad to have Hoag Urgent Care so conveniently located.<//text>

I had my first visit here today and I was so impressed! I've been to many of the Hoag facilities over the years and by far this one is the nicest. Aside from the office space, the staff was so friendly and helpful. You can tell they genuinely care about the patients. The PA I saw took her time to be very thorough and listen to my concerns. The whole experience was positive and seemless; which when you're sick or needing medical attention, is exactly what you want.</Review>

<Name>T Laughlin</Name><time>1595179642229<//time><Rate>5</Rate><review>I had a great experience at Hoag Urgent Care. I got an appointment within a hour! They were very efficient . A PA came out to my car, with an assistant and it was just like an office appointment. They were dressed in protective gear and I felt very comfortable when she gave me the Covid-19 test. I would highly recommend going to HOAG URGENT CARE at Foothill Ranch.<//review>< Pics>

I needed preoperative Covid testing. Made an appointment for the test. Everyone I interacted with from the first contact through the testing and leaving were caring, professional and attentive to all safety precautions. If necessary for an urgent issue, I would not hesitate to return.</Text>

I had my first experience with Hoag recently as my daughter was not feeling well. It was really great, from the customer service to the PA. The PA provided the necessary guidance to help keep my daughter comfortable, so hoping she'll be feeling better soon. Overall, great experience, with a new, nice facility and very clean. I would return, if needed. Thanks to everyone at Hoag!<//Text>

As long as you have your order number ready the process will run smoothly.

<Text>The individuals who performed our tests were friendly, kind and amazingly positive. I was extremely nervous driving up and they put both me and my Husband at ease. The people working and organizing the line had it down so well everything was clear and easy to follow. Results arrived via text at the 2hr mark but that was positioned it us during our testing process so we expected that. Thank you all.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1606772141119, 'text': 'Thanks for sharing your experience at our clinic with us Jordyn.  Sounds like it went great.

Tested on a Tuesday afternoon around 2:00. It took maybe 45-50 minutes to get through the line. We did have to fill out forms (on our phones) while waiting so it didn’t seem that long. Staff was super helpful and friendly. Totally recommend this site if you need testing done!!! 10/10< /text>

They were so helpful and quick. I had some anxiety about getting tested, but it was easy and not at all painful.
If you are in doubt,  getting tested gives you peace of mind.
Matt at the Temecula location helped us to register and get us on our way! Thanks again Matt!!</Review>

<Text>The website makes you think you are making an appointment for testing when in actuality, that means absolutely nothing. My daughter, who is sick, obviously, ended up having to sit in a car for 3 hours to get tested. Another person in line ran out of gas because they were not aware that they needed to prepare for that kind of a wait. Be honest with people.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80db7e3e94555555:0x1151ce64c9ad8146<//gmap_id></record>

Went to get tested today, it was very busy which is understandable but it was not organized efficiently. Arrived 20 minutes prior to appointment and was not seen until an hour and a half later. Paid for the rapid test to receive results in 20 minutes and it has been 2 hours and still no results. Tried emailing and calling, cannot get through or receive response.< /Review>

There were hundreds of people, I waited 2 hours and 50 minutes with my appointment. What’s the point of making appointments if you make so many appointments. For the money you are charging you should honor appointments.< /review>

<review>This review is speaking to the billing process of this clinic. We were told that we could submit the receipt to our insurance, so we called Blue Shield and they said yes, we would get reimbursement. We chose to spend the $150 with this is mind. However, after we submitted our claim to Blue Shield of California, they denied it as The Covid Clinic's superbill/medical receipt failed to have on it the ICD 10 codes come to find out. Later, we did see they send an email with it, however, Blue Shield needs this on the receipt specifically, as this is what you give to them (bummer you can't just forward an email to them). I usually don't write "negative" reviews, however, I think the Clinic should know that ICD 10 medical codes should be on the receipt for all people and not in an email so that more people can get easily and quickly reimbursed.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I was so surprised while waiting in line in my car  for my test just now to be watching the employees test someone, drop the test in a black box, use sanitizer on top of vinyl gloves and move on to the next person to test them. I asked the gentleman that approached me after doing that to please change his gloves and voiced my opinion that that was not safe and a best practice! He Stated that that is what they are told to do there. It is not hygienic to sanitize gloves and the way they were doing it was also very quick and nonchalant especially being that these people have their hands in covid all day. Very strange. This is Some thing I feel I should not  be experiencing ever, but especially when I’m paying $175.<//Review>

<Review>If you plan on billing your insurance like I was I would find another clinic to go to. It was easy enough to register and pay online. The testing process was a little slow but tolerable. I was told that I would relieve an email with an invoice so that I could turn around and bill my medical insurance. That never happened. Several days, emails, and phone calls later I was told by the covid clinic that they cant find any records that show I was tested. The results had my name on them so I assume they are mine? Bottom line if you are a cash payer this clinic maybe useful if you have insurance try another clinic.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1605373584878, 'text': "Hi, this is Matt, CEO of Covid Clinic.

Lengthy process. Long lines. Unorganized. It starts with one line. Then splits into two lines. Now the cars that were 8 cars behind me are passing me up after I’ve been waiting for over an hour in my car. By the looks of it, it looks like a bunch of kids are running this place. Just scrambling back and forth looking lost. Definitely “0” customer service.< /review>

I'd never recommend this place to anyone. In fact I'm going to warn people of this place. Not only is the line long took about two hours to get to the front but they also have extremely poor customer service. Hopefully all works out for you and you don't have an issue but if you do get ready to be ignored. It took me two weeks to not only get a reason as to why I hadn't received results but to also get a refund issued. Not even the supervisor Ashley would respond to my emails and it went directly into her email box. But if you do have an issue be sure to send multiple emails or you will get ignored. Good luck my fellow Temecula residents.</text>

If you’re looking for Rapid Results, this is the ONLY place in Temecula you should go! I tried to save 25$ at Temecula 24 hour Urgent care and it was A NIGHTMARE!  Covid Clinic is AMAZING!  Well worth the extra few bucks for this test! Don’t put your family members at risk!
It takes a minute or two to complete the info online and then the drive thru is extremely safe and convenient! Everyone was pleasant and helpful. At the other place, I felt like I was in a third world country!< /review>

Patience is one thing but this is ridiculous and the manager tried telling me that everyone in this line has an appointment even though there is a huge sign stating that there is no appointment necessary.   It would be as simple as setting up 2 lanes....just like at the DMV.< /Review>< Pictures>

At the Temecula Covid site Clinic, although the lines were very long, the clinical staff was very helpful friendly and quick to move us through the process! This was my second time using this test s I te location and again the testing itself was quick and results for me was about 15 minutes! Good job, and thank you for moving us although 😊 as fast as this type testing would allow!</Review>< rating>

<Text>I took the rapid antigen test TWICE on the SAME DAY and at the SAME LOCATION. The first test was POSITIVE for COVID and the second test was NEGATIVE for COVID. I just wasted around $400 to learn absolutely nothing and I am furious. I am hoping that I am just a statistical outlier, but the false positive rate is supposed to be extremely low. I have been on hold for an hour trying to get more information. I will update this review if I get anymore information.

EDIT: So I got a refund for one of the tests, took a PCR test instead of the rapid antigen test. Please be aware that the rapid tests can be wrong and that the PCR ones are more reliable (despite taking longer).<//Text><Time>1609387156075<//Time></record>

Friendly fast and easy. I tested negative, not sure how since I was sharing my drinks with a Covid 19 postive patient unaware she had it of course. Its very concerning that I dont have it....seems impossible.  I was with the patient for 2 weeks. Does this make sense to any of you out there???<//Review>

<text>Made an appointment for 9am and waited an hour to get a test. Why have appointment times when you have to wait with all of the cars that don't make appointments? The entire staff then decided to take a break right as we were almost done. Definitely the worst place to go to get tested.<//text>< Pics>

I showed up one hour prior to my appt time, and am partway through the line at one hour after my appt time. Who’s running this show? There’s nobody in charge. Endless zigzags around the mall parking lot dodging shoppers. This is very poorly organized.<//text>

Went to Chevy’s in Roseville for lunch.  Michelle T was our server and what a pleasant experience!  She is personable, helpful with the menu selections and expedient. Drinks were always topped off, fresh chips and salsa.  The food was great!  If you get a chance go by and ask for Michele T!</text>

This is some of the best chips and salsa you will ever have! The salsa here is amazing! And that is an understatement! The hire actual salsa tasters to test the salsa so it’s perfect and it is perfect! My wife and I drive over 10 hours so we can eat at Chevys several days in a row. It gets expensive, but the steak fajitas and unlimited chips and salsa make it soooo worth it!
Highly recommend! Other Chevys locations outside of California have gone out of business...so sad. But this location is thriving!< /text>

It had been a couple of years since we had been to Chevys so we decided to try it out the other night. Our overall experience was quite good. Javon was our server and was very polite and prompt. Drinks were a little sweet as expected but still good and not bad considering the price.</review>

Our visit to Chevys had a rough start with a rather rude hostess but Ari turned our visit around completely. She was the most friendly, attentive waitress.  She was crazy busy yet still made sure we were tended too and kept on top of checking in with all her tables.  Thank you Ari for your amazing customer service. Chevys Roseville should be very proud to have such an amazing employee.</Review>

<Text>I have eaten at this location many times and never wrote a review. Most of the time the service is good and the food is also good. Tonight we were served by an exceptional server Griselda. She is exceptional. If I could give her a raise I would. The hands down best experience I have ever had at Chevys. Her service and hustle were so beyond I had to write a review. She should be the main trainer for all the employees. Her demeanor, congeniality, and attention to detail are bar none. Well done Chevy's. I feel like eating here tomorrow just so I can be served by such a wonderful human.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1621832537875, 'text': "Thanks for leaving us such a wonderful review.

Our booth seat was torn and ugly and ambiance was lacking due to Covid measures.  Food and service was very good.  Fajitas were tasty but not much different than a steak bowl at Chipotle.<//Text>

The servers are fantastic here. My only complaint is management not paying attention to customers, it’s mostly left for everyone but the manager to take care of guests. It’s important for managers to be attentive and observant. I was sat by a service assistant as the manager walked past me, and the hostess not really an employee as she did not help me either. I sat for 10 minutes until the serve could come to be but she wa a busy. She was so nice to  me and my beverage I order was made perfect by the bartender. I rate the employees 5 starts and the manager 2 stars.< /Text>

Haven't been to Chevys for a couple years. Food was good, they have the best chips and salsa when the chips are warm. Id have to say that the service was pretty bad. Don't get me wrong the staff was very friendly and did everything they could to accommodate they were just running a restaurant with 3-4 people. Not something you would normally see.<//Text>

Just say no. Their booths are torn up. The menus are falling apart. Took 40 minutes for our food to come out and it was all extremely over cooked and dry. Other people who were sat well after us received their food before us. Do yourself a favor and skip eating at Chevys today and go down the street to Lorenzo's. That's where we ended up after leaving and it was 100% better all around. I think it is time for the Francise owner to invest a little something into their business.<//review>

After Chevys on the river was so atrocious we walked out,  we drove all the way to Roseville Chevys to celebrate our anniversary.  Although the view isn't the river,  the service and food was exemplary and more than makes up for it. The  staff were fabulous with perfect timing on everything. We will only come to this location in the future.  It seemed like every person who was working the floor checked in and showed their positivity and  enhanced the experience.  We have never had a single issue at this location but I am confident that if we ever did,  it would be corrected.  Each time we come,  the GM also pops by and truly makes his customers feel welcome and appreciated.   His passion and enthusiasm for his restaurant is contagious to his employees.   Thank you!  😊<//review>

<Text>Took 51minutes to make a soup, when over the phone I was told it would take 10 to 15 minutes.  Yes that's all we ordered, just wanted a soup, it is not even their busy time, it is 9:20pm on a weeknight.  Cost over $8, for a small cup of soup that was filled to 60% full.  Grossly overpriced food, poor service.  This is only the second time we have tried them.  Last time food was good but we also had issues with the order.  We arrived after the time we were told to pick up, only to be told that they haven't even started preparing yet, waited over 40 minutes in the parking lot.

That is it, not going to try a third time.  Will never order again< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rating>1</Rating></record>

<Review>The food was great but it took them 20 minutes to take our order and another 40 to bring it. We stood outside for 20 minutes prior for a table, thinking it was reduced capacity but they sat us in an area that was open the whole time we were waiting. The bar tender was our server and it seemed other people were getting drinks and food in a more timely manner than we did. They may have been short staffed, but a little communication on that goes a long way. Not a pleasant experience. We expect more for the prices we pay. Not sure if we'll return if this is the new way they're doing business.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rating>

The food is always on point, but the wait times and time for food to be delivered to your table leave you wanting  more. Usually we have excellent service (we go often!)

Went to Chevys for what I thought would be an enjoyable Easter dinner with my family but had a horrible experience. Our waiter was polite but didn't attend to our table much and Lacked giving my family any attention I had to ask for all the basic stuff that should already been provided instead he attended to the couples drinking more.. It took an hour to receive our food which was all over cooked burnt and dried out so most of the food got wasted. My husband got the bubble guts Immediately after eating one taco. I would not recommend going here and I will not be returning. Sorry chevys but every location my family tries the food ever comes out good.<//text>

<Review>Will not be visiting this location again.... waited 45 minutes for a to go order and while we waited we watched 5 different people touch our bag of food that was just sitting there, finally got fed up and asked the manager what was going on. They said they would re make our order because it had been sitting so long and all they did was take it into the back and brought out the exact same food and said it was "fresh". Quality of food was repulsive and we ended up throwing out $45 of food. Would NOT recommend.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The margaritas were good. I shouldn't have had to ask for the proper amount of Grand Marnier.  The service was unbelievably slow and I had to hunt down silverware after I asked for it three times. I asked well before my food arrived and twice after that. All in all this restaurant needs to step it up especially when lunch billed out at 70 dollars.<//review>

<review>Recently visited my children in Sacramento and we were looking for a restaurant that has outdoor dining. Chevys has two large tents set up with Christmas lights and space heaters to keep us warm. The service was fantastic as was the food. The waiter was very helpful in helping us pick out out drinks and food entree’s.</review>< Pictures>

Got a to-go order from Chevy's the other night. It was obvious the manager was the one that helped me. He was amazing! Very helpful and was making me laugh while putting my order together. Top notch customer service. I Definitely would go back<//review>

Wrong timing, hostess sat us at a table where the waitress was at break. Confusion as to who was waiting on us led to a 30 minute delay in ordering. Then no follow through with service. Complaint to the manager, we received some comps. No place can be perfect all the time and every other time we have gone to Chevy's has been 5 star.< /Text>

I got an email notification that it was national happy hour day and happy hour prices would be served until midnight, which was a fun way to spend Thursday night. There was a DJ for the night who was great and the music added to the fun night out. I ordered a strawberry margarita on the rocks and my husband did the same but mango. Great drinks for the price, my only wish is that we had been offered a sugar or salt rim as that’s part of the fun of ordering a margarita ;). I had salmon tacos and my husband chicken, and we were pleased with the good food and quick service. Our waiter Richardo was friendly, attentive, and took care of all our needs! I’d definitely recommend him! :)   We were also pleased to see the restaurant following COVID safety measures and having the tables appropriately distanced with staff wearing masks.</Review>< Resp>

Awesome. Friendly, and attentive. Food, delicious. Have not experienced  Chevy for well over 3years, had no idea they were still around. Loved it then before closing in Modesto, so the Roseville site was a perfect outing with family. A perfect  surprise. A perfect time spent. In a word, serendipitous!</Text>

Had the $8.00 dollar meal on a Sunday brunch menu... The waitress wasn't so mean in what the flavors where hot or not and such... She seemed like she didn't want to b there... She is refill our drinks which was nice and chips and salsa... But I would think she would know the menu better... And what I got wasn't good at all but the fried eggs... got the Chilaquiles the enchilada sauce was spicy which she said it wasn't at all so there was that and she said it was the same as the salsa spice or not
Will definitely get something different next time</text>

Waiter was forgetful and not really friendly at all. The seats were shredded (torn to shreds) and need to be redone. Cannot be sanitary. The frozen Margarita was not served as advertised; i.e. no sugar rim. Very disappointed with that, but not a huge thing. We kept having to ask for salt for my husband's meal. We waited multiple times for requested items and he kept forgetting. We so appreciated the restaurant being open but it left a lot to be desired. It was not crowded, so really no reason for the spaciness of the waiter.</text>

<Review>I called 3 weeks ago to make reservations to reserve the outdoor seating for a large party. I was told they had my reservation, called to see if i could add 2 people to my reservation and they said they did not have my reservation. My surprise party that im planning is now the following weekend. I talked to a manager and she told me to call back the next day if I didnt get a call back at 3pm, I called back at 4 the following day and someone answered the phone and I asked for the manager. He wasn't very nice right off the bat like i was calling to complain, I gave him a quick run down about talking to the other manager and needing to talk to the one on shift now, as told. He said he would talk to the manager and give me a call back. Did not get a call back AGAIN. I explained I needed to know one way or another ASAP to make other arraignments since I lost two weeks thinking I had reservations at this location. HORRIBLE managers and staff. Will never recommend this location. They should have said im sorry your reservations were lost and then at least let me know if I could or couldnt still have it there. Its mind blowing< /Review><Response>{'time': 1615346357795, 'text': 'Hello Amanda,\nThank you so much for your review. I am very sorry to hear about your experience with us.

Good place for a group. This time we had two long tables next to each other,  I'd say it's better than one LONG table that way. It made conversation much easier.

I was hungry, so this time I opted for the  Super Cinco, a combo of five  different meals in one: beef enchilada, chicken enchilada, beef taco, pork tamale, and chile relleno with a side of beans and rice. It took three plates to hold it all! I started with the tamale, and the corn meal crust was thick and juicy, just the way it should be. The rest of it was good, too. It took a while, but I managed to finish it all. :-)<//text>

Chevys is our favorite restaurant.  Miguel is a very attentive waiter who made sure our drinks were refilled and checked on us often. We were sad to see the Auburn location go but so happy to have Roseville not too far away.  I highly recommend!< /Text>

<Text>My experience was great. I had the Cucumber cilantro margarita with black salt rim. And enchilada and taco. Can't go wrong with the chips and salsa here. But both my parents dishes disappointed them. Bummer on Father's Day. Great service. Longish wait, but holiday. I'll still definitely come back chips and salsa are always grand slam.<//Text>< Pictures>

Waited yesterday for 15 minutes at a booth and no one came to take even my drink order. It wasn't busy either. The waiter in my area helped two other takes that came in after me, but still never even acknowledged me. When I was walking out, I told another waiter why and they said it wasn't their section.

This isn't the first time I've had horrible service from this place. Before the pandemic, my work would often have tgif there. Waiting for a refill, or even to get a salt shaker could take 10-15 minutes. Even when paying, they would disappear with your credit card for nearly 20 minutes. Horrible service.<//text>

The very first time I went to Chevys it was a pretty good place to eat and chill have drinks and stuff everything was clean everything was nice but this particular time I went me and my family The Forks were dirty I'm drinking my soda out of a dirty cup didn't even know the cup was dirty until I drink the soda down halfway and I'm seen food particle stuck inside not on the Outside but the Inside of the cup just ruined my whole appetite because it looked really disgusting. I would never eat there again never< /Text>

So nice to have Chevys open once again. Miguel provided excellent service and did a great job communicating thru the mask. Social distancing works well in their large dinning area. Keep the faith. Bill<//text>

Horrable service. Waited over a hour for appetizers. Sat with a empty glass of beer for 15 minutes tell the waiter came bay ordered another one and watched our waiter walk out side to sing happy birthday and hang out with the other server. Ended up going to the bar myself to get my own beer.

Needless to say stay away from this place we will never go back.</review>

The waiter was OK. Lacked any personality. The prices were crazy high for what you get. I was very disappointed with this Chevy's location. Dought if I  would ever go back.</text>

< review>
I have ordered to go for pickup twice in the last week. Super slow, small portions & over priced for the portion size. Perhaps dine in is better. The food flavors are quite good. The slow part I understand due to Covid. They really need to address the  portions vs price for Togo orders.</review>

Costumer service was attentive and nice.

The food tasted fresh and delicious. Left me feeling good. I ordered the fajita tacos off the dinner menu and my toddler had a burger and fries.

The restaurant has a bar side and dining side which made taking my toddler very pleasant and appropriate. I look forward to going back.< /Text>

First time dining out in 2 months due to Covid! Chevys is one of our favorites and I was excited to hear they were now open! Took the family on Saturday for dinner and had a great experience.  Will definitely go back. Good is always good and so is the service 👍<//Text>

Alejandro and the food is the only reason this place is great.

However DO NOT get drinks here. For $12 / drink (I got 2 large Mojitos) it was VERY little alcohol. I question if the 1st drink even had any liquor in it.

Have a shot of something before you go here, or just drink their limited beer selection. Dont waste your money on pretend liquor like I did! Or ask for the shot to be seperated so you know you arent getting ripped off!<//review>

<text>Service was only OK, and there were hardly any other people there. Food was lukewarm and just okay. Not the best Chevy's and not as good as they used to be. The rice was orange.

< Review>
Update...its been 2 years...

I broght my niece here for her birthday...we made a reservation through yelp.  When we arrived we were seated right away.

It took a while for someone to come to our table to take the drink order. We were ready to put in our order instead of waiting.

While we were sitting there...we heard two of the staff openly say how much they hate there job...clearly...the service paired with the GROSS DIRTY DISHES prove there is no pride AT THIS PLACE...HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE.

I have been several times before...but it has been at least 2 years. I would not have come if she did not choose this place.

We ordered the mixed grilled fajitas to share...for the outrageous price of almost 27.00. Boy have the prices sky rocketed.

1. The chicken was so dry...neither of us wanted to eat it.
2. The steak was not good at all.
3. The shrimp and carnitas was very good.
4. It used to come with guacamole...they charge more and eliminated that.
5. It used to come with butter sauce for shrimp...did not get that...had to ask for it.

When we needed more tortillas...we saw our waitress for her to come...and she literally walked the other way.

This place has gone down hill...

No wonder their rating is only 3 star.

See my photos of dirty plate...no guac...no butter sauce for shrimp.

Never again.

I came here with my mom. The prices certainly have changed. We usually get the fajitas with all 4 meats to share. It came with beans... rice...meat...sour cream...guacamole...onions and peppers.

The price a couple months ago was 18.99. Now they are 24.99...same portion..but no more guacamole.

The menu advertises they are served flame ignited at the table...ours wasn't.

The flavor was good...but very disappointed at price increase...minus guacamole..not flame ignited as advertised. I like their food...but if I did not have a birthday coupon..I would not spend 25.00 for this. I just font think it is worth it. 18.00...I got that several times...but 25.00...I would spend that same money elsewhere.  It's a shame there was such a huge price increase for less food...😭😭😭</Review>

< Review>
Went at lunchtime very few customers snail slow service. Food tasted like it was left over from last night we waited until our meal was served for water that we ask for several times. I ordered a fish taco and it looked like they dropped half the fish on the way to the table. I have been to several other Chevys and had an enjoyable experience I will not go back to this particular one again.<//Review>

Went at lunchtime very few customers snail slow service. Food tasted like it was left over from last night we waited until our meal was served for water that we ask for several times. I ordered a fish taco and it looked like they dropped half the fish on the way to the table. I have been to several other Chevys and had an enjoyable experience I will not go back to this particular one again.<//text>

Rude management, clearly overworked employees and stale food all come together to form the disgrace that is this restaurant. "Fresh" chips sit for up to a week+ and same with salsa. Cooks touch certain foods with their bare hands instead of gloves and rarely if ever wash them. Many items such as the kid's mini corn dogs come directly out of prepackaged bags from Wal-Mart. Do not eat here.< /Review>

<review>Update! 1/14/20

Was served in the bar during Happy Hour by Casey G. As in Greeted immediately, as in Great service, as in Gonna come back next week and ask for him.

In a very very busy bar with what we confirmed had only one server, and at least 14 tables, we were well taken care of. As if there were three servers on duty. Very attentive, stopping to answer any question or concern that we have. Double checking on the quality of food not only for us for tables around us. As a very heavy contrast we had recent experiences that were less than pleasant. One was so difficult that we weren’t even seated, and had our party leaving frustrated. His bar knowledge only improved his serving skills further and the quality of the food matched the skill of Casey. We will come back sooner than normal.

The food. The drinks. The Service!
.
Everything was amazing start to finish, our server Frederic made the experience what it was. The food is always great quality, but the pacing and drinks and attentiveness is something that differs server to server, needless to say we will always be asking if Frederic’s section is an option.
.
Happy hour had a great variety of food and drinks, and I was thrilled to find I could order a single enchilada when I wanted to try something new. Thanks Chevys!</review>< Pictures>

I have gone to Chevy's a few times and the service was standard, but I had to leave a review for my experience this time around because of our amazing server, Samantha, or Sam, I think, is what she went by. Me and my friends walked in and got seated right away. A bubbly, red headed server, Sam, walked over to our table and greeted us with a huge genuine smile. She took our drink orders, and came back pretty quickly, along with chips and salsa. She was always very perceptive to our table (even though she had a few others as well), and was great at multi tasking. She gave us enough time to look over the menu and took our orders with an enthusiastic demeanor (very genuine). I threw a curve ball at her and was torn between a few menu items. I asked her what she liked/preferred, and without hesitation, gave her recommendations (based off a few opened ended questions from her-to make it easier on the both of us). She recommended the chicken fajita plate, and it was delish! Thank you Sam and Chevys for the amazing customer service. I recommend this place and especially Sam.</Text>

I have gone to Chevy's a few times and the service was standard, but I had to leave a review for my experience this time around because of our amazing server, Samantha, or Sam, I think, is what she went by. Me and my friends walked in and got seated right away. A bubbly, red headed server, Sam, walked over to our table and greeted us with a huge genuine smile. She took our drink orders, and came back pretty quickly, along with chips and salsa. She was always very perceptive to our table (even though she had a few others as well), and was great at multi tasking. She gave us enough time to look over the menu and took our orders with an enthusiastic demeanor (very genuine). I threw a curve ball at her and was torn between a few menu items. I asked her what she liked/preferred, and without hesitation, gave her recommendations (based off a few opened ended questions from her-to make it easier on the both of us). She recommended the chicken fajita plate, and it was delish! Thank you Sam and Chevys for the amazing customer service. I recommend this place and especially Sam.< /text>

Food was fresh and tasty.  Our server, Miguel, was very attentive and prompt. Only con, the corn tortillas were old and tough. Otherwise, highly recommend.<//text>

<Review>The staff here is very kind. I really loving attending this place. I would suggest everyone take the time to head in. I love the fries here and the beer is always cold. Get the tacos and a margarita. Oh and it's really well run. The crowd fluctuates in size. There is nothing wrong with this great place, I hope you like it too.< /Review>< pictures>

Taking longer to pay for my togo order than for food to be ready.    Only one person has key for register as no one else is trusted.</review>

<review>It was terrible last time I went, it was a Sunday night, I sat a the bar and nobody greeted me for like 10 minutes, there was only one bartender making the drinks and taking the tables around the bar, after 10 minutes he finally told he would be right there in just a minute to help me but he never did, I kept waiting for like another 10 minutes but ended up leaving the place after 20 to 25 minutes of waiting, he never ask me if I want something to drink or eat and there was only 1 more person seating at bar he was more worried about taking care of the tables around the bar and making other tables drinks. I can't believe the class of service they offer, I will never go back to this place again.< /review><Name>Carlos< /Name>< Pictures>

I have been going to the Chevy’s since they opened.  Today I had the best service I’ve had in 10 years.  Josh, our waiter, was so friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable of the menu. Made our brunch so fun!!!!!  Will come back to sit at his table again soon.</Text>

Food from the Chevys Roseville location was fantastic, staff was patient and very helpful. This said, more needs to be done in the waiting  line to keep order and have social distance. Very disorganized, no order requiring people to stand too close.<//review>

<Text>Absolutely worst Chevy’s I’ve been too. They weren’t even that busy and we never really saw our waitress and someone completely different served us our food and it took them a long time. Then they tried to walk away without even handing us silverware. When we got the food it tasted terrible and was cold. I didn’t even finish the food and the waitress asked me if I wanted a box I told her no. At that point she probably should had asked if there was a problem with the food we just spent money on but of course she walks away. I felt pretty bad because I recommended this restaurant to a friend and it was absolutely terrible.</Text>< pictures>

We are long time Chevy’s goers. We couldn’t figure out why one by one the restaurants were shutting down until today. We have always shared mixed grill fajitas and enjoyed them, but not today. The portion sizes have shrunk while the prices have gone way up. The fajitas used to come with guacamole and now it doesn’t. We just found out the Corporation who owns Chevy’s now charges a surcharge on the bill to offset labor costs. What???? Passing off your problems onto the customer is not cool.  Sheesh Chevys, you have just lost two loyal customer 😡<//text>

<Text>Roseville. I had the sampler plate and would not recommended it. The chicken wings were dry and the sauce was very hot. I felt the dish was very pricey for what we got.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Ordered two days in advance for mothers day, for pick up at 4 pm. First over the phone they said they had chevy burgers, when i got there they said my order was almost done( this was at 4 pm) 20 mins later, they tell me they no longer have chevy burgers , so i order something else from their menu. 20 mins after that somebody comes out to my car and tells me that the cook dropped the salmon on the floor and that was their last o e. They completely forgot my order of chevys mixed grilled  fajitas, that was on my original  order. The food was terrible, cold ,no flavor. I waited an hour for the food i got. Chandos Tacos is 100% better and operate out of a truck here in Citrus Heights.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Great atmosphere, great food, very generous with the chips and salsa (and tortillas!). Our waiter, Josh, was the BEST waiter we've ever had (at any restaurant)! Excellent kids' menu with build-your-own sundaes for the little ones.<//Review>

< Review>
I've always been big fan of Chevy's for over 20 years and this location is no exception. The food is always good and the portions are pretty big. I tend to eat a lot and I almost always have something left over to bring home. In our most recent visit, it was a fairly busy weekend in the holiday season and it the latter part of the dinner hour, but we were not down immediately at a booth. They provided a kid's menu with crayons for our two-year-old. And the food was ready very quickly. I think our server was a little new, but I would still recommend Chevy's every time.<//Review>

Chevy's is a delight. We freaking love their food. The flautas are to die for. Literally. Well...not literally. But they're dang good. The birthdays are fun. Miguel is awesome. He's got the skills. The charm. The flair. He is...the Chevy's maestro. The Jedi master. Go eat at Chevy's. You won't be sorry.</review>

We had a party of 12 and were seated for 25 minutes with no waiter or waitress ever once coming over to greet us or take drink order, nothing. We then went to counter to ask if we could get help. Not good.</Review>

Given we are all stuck at home right now, I decided to order Chevy's to go for a little cheering up and to support local businesses.  I now wish I hadn't.  Our food arrived with no tortillas for the fajitas, the side of sour cream & pico de gallo was tiny, and some of the food tasted like it had been warmed in the microwave.
Tried calling them to complain or work out a solution, but they wouldn't answer the phone. Considering we ended up paying over $100 for 4 plates of food, I feel completely ripped off.  Never doing that again.< /review>

Only saving grace here is the price vs meal size.  Service was horribly slow, and the waiter couldn't remember anything about us.  Brought the ticket to the table before asking if we wanted anything more.  Took forever to get our food, which was mediocre at best, even though they weren't overly busy and appeared to have plenty of wait staff.  Our appetizer came with the food, even though the waiter asked when we wanted it, and we said before.  Overall, enough bad experiences that we won't be going to Chevys again.< /Review>

Last Night I came into Chevys for my favorite flautas and favorite drink with my family. It was quite busy for a Tuesday night, the bar was filled to the brim. The great busser Francisco noticed that we were waiting around for someone to get up out of a booth. As soon as one cleared up Francisco cleared it off and sanitized it for us. Shortly after Karan came up with a basket of hot chips and fresh cold salsa(my favorite) . My
Overall experience was amaZing , 5 out 5 on service food and drinks. Thank you for the great experience< /Text>

Great experience tonight at Chevy's. A young lady named Shay sat us very quickly, our server was Joshua, he was very attentive and had a great attitude.
Both seemed like they were  very happy to see us. The place seemed to be busy and I was surprised to get so much attention . Thanks, Eddy</Text>

<review>A friend and I went to Chevy's in Roseville today for lunch and drinks.We walked in and sat at the bar.The place was clean and had a good vibe. Overall it was a great experience the food was good and the drinks were outstanding, happy hour they have some good deals. The best part was our server/bartender Lesya ! She served us as well as some other tables, kept up with all the orders for drinks and food and still made time to ask how everything was and such personality in her conversation. Such a beautiful person and a sweetheart, she made it look easy even though she was pretty busy. I'd give more then 5 stars if I could ,well done Lesya and the rest of the Chevy's crew, will definitely be back !< /review><date>1558741640086<//date>< rating>

< Review>
Service from Tania was 5 stars *****
Salsa was excellent! Other food was so-so, because they ran out of flour tortillas and substituted corn tortillas with fajitas. They don’t go together well. The doughy corn tortillas overwhelm the taste of everything else. They assured me that won’t happen again and on my last serving provided the tortillas they normally use for burritos-that was waaaaaay better. The shrimp was a bit on the fishy side. We will be back, but will pass on the shrimp & make sure to get the usual flour tortillas. Again, service with a smile was excellent from Tania. Thank you!</Review>

This place is always good! Busy and delicious. They give you chips and salsa when you get to the table, but a little tip... Ask for some of their house made tortillas. They are delicious dipped in salsa 👍🏻<//Text>

<Review>Had a margarita, tasted no alcohol at all! Took 15 min just to get served, food was just ok. They were very busy, so that's why it took so long to be served, nothing wrong on servers part. The alcohol, for the price we pay should definitely taste like an alcohol drink and not a virgin. I barley drink, so I should have tasted it, very disappointing.
Food was the taste of Chevys, which is not authentic so that's expected! Anyways, they were busy, so obviously they're doing something right! Just not for me! I still give it a 3 star because it was not aweful!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Been a few years since visiting this establishment, quickly recalled why.
Dried food stuck to the supposed clean utensils, dirty tables and beverage glass. I won't even gross you out with the food description, you'll find out when you visit. Only reason this location is still open must because of the bar and alcohol served. Good luck< /Text>

This is the second time in a month that we have come here. Both times very disappointing. The one positive thing in this instance was our server. He was busy but tried very hard. Bar/drink service was lousy
It took 20 minutes to get our 2 margaritas. Don't know if they were short staffed or what. Server comped our guacamole. Well done sir. Won't be going back anytime soon.<//text>

Can't go wrong with the house Margarita. Especially when it's happy hour. Ordered the handmade guac at the table, Fuego fries and salmon tacos. Everything was really good. Enjoy the salmon tacos the most.< /text>

Food and Service quality can vary from visit to visit. Sometimes great and then next time not so great, never know what you will encounter. They do have great chips and salsa always though.

Update 1/22/19. Party of 7 plus toddler for family birthday. Want to give a Huge Shout Out to our sever Justin tonight . What a pleasure he was.  Super attentive, friendly and all around Awesome. Hands down best service have had in a long time. Thanks Justin for helping us celebrate tonight!< /text>

<review>I came in for my birthday dinner and a margarita. My friend saw a table menu that was promoting National Margarita Day and asked our waitress about it. She wanted to know if there were any specials. The waitress was rude and said she didn't know what my friend was talking about. My friend pointed out the menu, and the waitress still had nothing informative to say. I then asked what kind of margaritas do you have, and she said they are on the menu. I grabbed the table menu which was apparently the wrong one because she corrected me again, telling me that it's on the menu.  So then I was looking at the menu, and I told her that I wanted Something fruity. I was looking for a suggestion, but once again, she told me that they are on the menu and that I could add a flavor for a $1. I asked what the flavors were. Once again, rudely, told me that they were on the menu.  I understand that they are on the menu, but to try to speed things along and help me decide, I was asking. Since she was not helpful, I told her she could get my friend her margarita while I decided. When she brought my friend's drink, she did not ask me if I had decided. She past our table twice without asking if I was ready, knowing I was trying to order a drink. I decided to ask for a manager because our waitress was making me uncomfortable and angry.  The manager was nice but seemed not concerned with my complaint. I had asked for a new waitress and told her I didn't know what I had done to our waitress or if she was having a bad day. The manger said sorry I felt that way and got us a new waitress.  It was not the best birthday experience. I did; however, get very good service after we switched our waitress. The first part of the dinner wasn't great but ended on a good note.<//review>< pictures>

Went to Chevys on Douglas yesterday and it was FABULOUS!!!  The service was wonderful and the food was amazing.  I had a soft beef taco with a cheese enchilada.  The taco was perfect and it was obvious the tortilla was super fresh!  The enchilada sauce was great!  I was also super impressed with the rice and ala charra beans.  You can totally tell that management takes a lot of pride in their restaurant.  I'm looking forward to returning!  Oh,  I also noticed the curbside option!  Love it!  What a great idea!<//Text>

It was not good at all my hamburger was dried out. The fries had only seasoning on top and there were lukewarm. The chicken tortilla soup if that's what you want to call it was more of a corn chowder I have two pieces of chicken tortillas and two very small slices of guacamole there was more corn in it than anything. And it seemed to take awhile to get her food and then it still didn't even come out together. It was not very busy in there. I will not be going back to that Chevys.< /Text>

I ordered a catering tray of La Charra beans for pickup and was deeply surprised that the price had doubled since my last order, about 8 months ago. The quantity of beans in the tray had also decreased. Will not order again.</text>

Dinner time: Amazing service, food came quick. Young male waiter was professional and responsible. He promised that he would get extra plates and then he and another person got us lots of extra plates. He provided dough for the kids to play with while we waited for our food. He restocked on chips and salsa often. He checked on us frequently. I haven't had great service like this at a chain restaurant in a really long time. The food was pretty good, but it was more peppery than flavorful.< /text>

I just don't get why people like this place. They got rid of a lot of their old menu. What they have left is boring, strange, and overly sweet. Out of our family's five meals, the salad was the only good one. Salsa was particularly good today. My soup was cold and not good. Service was slow. And all of it is unreasonably overpriced for what it is.< /review>

<review>Quick to seat you. Quick to take your order. Then..... 15 minutes after ordering our appetizer and salt. Still waiting. Couple minutes later our sampler appetizer showed up. NO PLATES to put our potions on.  Something you would think would come with a large appetizer.... asked server if we should of gotten plates the answer was no they are not offered. We had to ask to have plates. Ohhh yeah the salt finally showed up.  We didnt even get two bites down of our sampler plate and the main course shows up.. I mean come on people. Your customers are not cattle.  And my dinner is cold straight from the kitchen. My wife's food is barely warm.
Went and spoke with the manager on all the above.
She apologized and said she would have new plates out in 3 minutes....
Three minutes later HOT FOOD. Delivered by the manager. The food is correct and good.
I started this review with a one star changed it to the 3 star
Ty Mam for taking care of your customers.< /review>< Pics>

Great place to eat but the noise might ruin your dinner. The salads there are wonderful I had to Fajita chicken yum I do have to say and the reason I gave four stars is because my margarita had absolutely no tequila in it that was detectable. Very very disappointed especially since the cost is I think High.$11 is too much to pay for a margarita that is blah. Everyone else in my party or pretty much vegetarians and they enjoyed it there was plenty on the menu for them.< /Text>

I asked for a quiet corner, as my son is autistic and my mom was working on the phone. They were happy to oblige, and even turned the music down! (Most places, they say they will but it's not noticable.) The veggie fajitas (for a vegan eater) still had lots of stuff in them.</review>

<Review>I wish Eltoreto's never bought them. They have never really been the same.  Got the Mixed grill and everything was undercooked.  So gross. The cooks if you can call them that do not care what leaves the kitchen.  The waitress was great but working to many tables.  Management...   I'll never go back.  I think all the care about is how much money they make in the bar.<//Review>< GmapID>

<review>Our orders weren't right,  they took a long time to get to our table,  a Male employee spoke loudly to his co workers (while carrying a table's order) saying "they are all over the restaurant"(the first thing we thought of was cockroaches but "they " were only known by his co workers that must be hard of hearing.  I imagine that last night they just had a bad night.  Like,  it's not normally THAT bad.  We will NEVER go there again . I did tip the waitress but I also asked her to make sure whoever cleans the tables gets the stickiness off for them that we had to deal with and that she should make sure that the guests have silverware and napkins at their table. She was courteous and accepted my constructive criticism and thanked me so she can improve. Overall though,  we will never return to dine there again.<//review>< Pictures>

I wish Eltoreto's never bought them. They have never really been the same.  Got the Mixed grill and everything was undercooked.  So gross. The cooks if you can call them that do not care what leaves the kitchen.  The waitress was great but working to many tables.  Management...   I'll never go back.  I think all the care about is how much money they make in the bar.<//text>

It's Chevy's so expect mid-tier Mexican food with a good environment with prices that are a little high of fair, but they always serve a damn tasty margarita.</Review>

<Text>Personally, I think Chevy’s isn’t what it used to be, but it’s a good place for a Southwestern Mexican meal. Famous for their house made chips and salsa and fancy margaritas, it delivers pretty consistent menu options.  Ingredients seem to be fresh and you get a lot of food. Oh and yeah, they got fajitas. Probably their most recognizable dish which is served on a searing hot plate and house made tortillas.  My biggest knock is the service. I wouldn’t say it’s the individual servers fault, but more that they just don’t have enough on shift. You literally watch them run around trying to get to all the tables, deliver food and drinks... just feel like service would improve with a few more staff on the floor.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The waiter, Williams (with an s at the end), was very attentive and accommodating. Since they were put of certain ingredients, he let us know. When the chef made a mistake on an appetizer, he let us know a correct order was already on the way. Huge portions, semi-comfy booths, trendy ambiance.<//text>

< review>
Our waitress was very VERY sweet. She was busy as hell and still made time to check on us and give our toddler some dough and icecream. She gets 5 stars for sure! The cooks...not as great. We had to ask for the 3 items they forgot several times. The happy hour margarita was the yuckiest margarita I've ever had. It had no salt in it (at my request) yet it tasted like like half a salt shaker over rocks. I couldn't drink it. And bc I liked my waitress so much, I didnt complain and just left the drink on the table when I left.
We love Chevys. Maybe just an "off" day this time. I'm sure we'll be back.<//review>

Chevy's very good today, food wise.  I mean it is not really mexican food, but it was good for our large group.  Patron margarita was tasty. We went for Ian's birthday, which is today. Despite an eager staff, he wasn't interested in having them sing nor would he wear the sombrero. So that was a little disappointing. But his birthday quesadillas were quite good.</review>

Walked in and were told it was open seating, and it took a very long time for anyone to serve us. Servers and waitresses would look at us and walk away, we almost left, but then finally someone started our order. The drinks were tasty and the food came out hot, so in the end we were happy.</text>

Slow, slow, slow service. Went for lunch and it took well over 30 minutes just to get our food! When it was finally delivered to our table it was cold. Had to get up for my own take out box and spoke to mgr on my way back to table.  He didn't want to be bothered and blew me off. Too bad, I really like the chain but I won't go back.<//Text>

Love Chevy's good family environment. Wait staff knows us and knows what we want to order every time we return our visit. And they were always sure to get our kids crayons and dough to play with</review>

Raw meat, chilie relleno  was al dente and its chesse was chesse sauce. The chips where stale. We spent $50.00 on mexican food that ranked less than fast food at taco shop. Could have saved a lot of $ @ taco bell. We're very disappointed< /Text>

Can't rate the food because the service was so slow we left before even getting chips and salsa.  Other tables that were seated after us we're ordering food and had chips and salsa. We finally just got up and left.< /Text>

<text>Chevy's very good today, food wise.  I mean it is not really mexican food, but it was good for our large group.  Patron margarita was tasty. We went for Ian's birthday, which is today. Despite an eager staff, he wasn't interested in having them sing nor would he wear the sombrero. So that was a little disappointing. But his birthday quesadillas were quite good.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x809b1ff13812f4ed:0xdf8c58ff53a3383d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've always been big fan of Chevy's for over 20 years and this location is no exception. The food is always good and the portions are pretty big. I tend to eat a lot and I almost always have something left over to bring home. In our most recent visit, it was a fairly busy weekend in the holiday season and it the latter part of the dinner hour, but we were not down immediately at a booth. They provided a kid's menu with crayons for our two-year-old. And the food was ready very quickly. I think our server was a little new, but I would still recommend Chevy's every time.</text>< Resp>

Food was so so. Disappointed in my bartender and the table service. Drinks are not at all strong but was a fun atmosphere. Very loud and fun, but can get crowded. Came for happy hour and the line was out the door by 6.<//review>

Supposed to be social distancing and I was just by there and there have to be about 100 people all around the front door most without masks.  I guess they are waiting for their marquritas to go!! Terrible!!  the management should do something about this

I had the seafood enchiladas and was very impressed. Also the chips and salsa are the best I've had and are both made fresh daily. The customer service was good also. Google local approved.< /review>

<Text>the food was great, the servers were fast and attentive, always seeing to our needs

we have eaten there 4 times since June 1
love their happy hour
their flaunts are no longer on happy hour but are only 9.99 so they are still a great deal
will keep coming back

love those coupons keep them coming

Well fellow foodies I am changing my review on this location. Now on more than one occasion I have been sat and ignored. Place had many empty tables and yet our table could not even get chips and salsa after 30 mins. As we got up to leave, not one person tried to assist. I had to ask for a manager to help them see how they were failing their location. So if you go into the location on Douglas Blvd do not tolerate sub-standard - know you can get up and leave, other places are right around the corner.< /Review>

That being said, I don't know what it is but the past two times I have been to this Chevys I have got violently ill after. Like severe food poisoning, and this time it was me and my 5 year old son. That is my reasoning for only 1 star. I probably won't be going back there, unfortunately.< /text>< Rate>

Young waitress kept talking about her party life and "getting wasted" Food took way too long to come out, and my shrimp scampi was close to room temperature. If u want good service, and quality food go to Auburn.<//Text>

Plenty of parking and good Mexican food. I think their prices are a bit on the high side and the soft drink prices are unreasonably overpriced but I do like their salsa and steak or chicken fajitas. Staff has always been friendly.< /review>

<Text>I wish I could give this place negative stars because this is the seriously the worst chevys ever! Me and my friends waited longer than we were told which was 15 minutes but ended up waiting 45 minutes. The place wasnt packed at all but started to fill up as we waited. We had to remind the host we've been waiting a long time because she was already seating other people who came after us! Afyer another 15 minutes we were seated. The food wasn't hot ,the sauce was cold, the dishes were dirty and the waitress was very slow and didnt seem like she knew what she was doing. I believe the view of the river compensates for the horrible service and even that part sucked!  Don't waste your time or money at a dump like this.< /Text><name>Maxx Stratton<//name><Date>1548636489140</Date>< userid>

I have been a Chevy's patron for many many years. I don't know if this location is under new management, has a new chef, or habe just changed their standards again, but I was very disappointed in my Nacho Grande. I asked for extra of the red sauce and wound up with a totally different red/orange sauce that did not complement the dish at all. The cheese and meat were basically one thin layer and left me with a plate full of untouched chips.
Normally I would rate Chevy's with at least 4 stars, but this time they barely hit the 3 star mark.
I hope this was just a fluke, otherwise my long lived loyalty will be gone.<//text>

The food and drink is always good at chevy's but the bar service is missing the mark by a long shot. I know expectations at a place like Chevy's are understandably low when it comes to service, but this was lesser than low.<//text>

<Text>The food and drink is always good at chevy's but the bar service is missing the mark by a long shot. I know expectations at a place like Chevy's are understandably low when it comes to service, but this was lesser than low.<//Text><Response>None</Response><Rate>3< /Rate><GmapID>0x809b1ff13812f4ed:0xdf8c58ff53a3383d<//GmapID>< Date>

Food is predictable and we'll prepared. Prices are consistent with similar chain restaurants. Fare staffing, not great but they get the job done.</Text>

<text>I wasn't very happy with our visit to this Chevy's restaurant on Douglas Blvd. In Rsvl. The guy up front didn't even greet us for awhile even after he took care of everybody else he just stayed behind his little table and stared at the kitchen then after I said something he says oh I thought u were waiting for someone. ???? 😕 All I ordered was chips & salsa to go & for some unknown reason we waited 24mins. It wasn't busy or crowded there & it was a Tuesday nite. The guy just hands me the order & walks back to the kitchen with no apology or have a good nite or anything. If that's what to expect from eating there then that would make got a terrible dining experience. I was very disappointed & surprised and I'm not sure I want to go back to that Chevy's for awhile.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

OMG.. Service was bad and I mean BAD.. Not just our server. From hostess to management.. Took them over an hour to get our food. Well, at least the food we ordered.. Everybody around us got their refills on chips and drinks while they just passed by us. 5 tables served and gone by the time we even got our food. Gave us a lot of excuses and sorries. Oh and 20% off our bill, from management.. Wow, thanks a while $2..</Review>

<Text>I took my father there for the 1st time Jan 2, 2019.   We had a waiter named Josh.  We asked for Guacomole for a starter.  Josh told us they did not have avocadoes to make guacamole.  He offered the guac that is served as a side.  We were given 2 tablespoons of that.  My fish tacos had old lettuce and about an ounce of fish in them and they were cold.  No Pico de Gallo or cheese on them.  When I asked about the slaw that normally goes on them, I was told they were out of cabbage!  My father's fajita burrito was also cold as were the sides.  When I spoke to the manager about the food and inquired about the lack of some of the food he told me they had avocadoes and cabbage.  He was not pleased the food was cold and terrible.  Our waiter was lazy and simply did not want to make our guac dip. He comped our meals.  I won't be going back.  If I could give it zero stars I would!< /Text>< response>

$20 flank steak had me chewing endlessly just to break up one bite enough to swallow and they couldnt even cook it to medium (came out well done). This place is in the price category of Chili's but quality is less than Denny's.</Review>

< review>
A huge disappointment. The service was slow and inattentive despite the fact the restaurant was not busy. This should have been a hint for us to go elsewhere as we had arrived about 12:30 and there was no 'lunch rush'. The food was overcooked (the beef in my fajitas was dry and chewy) and bland.< /review>

The brunch menu was meh. Churro pancakes delish! Bloody Marys meh I've had way better. Service was good. Our waiter spoke broken English, you could tell he was new, but he was kind, attentive and was really trying. Aside from the hostess and manager everyone there seemed to to be and immigrant, so they were difficult to understand but delivered amazing service.  I wouldn't do brunch there again though<//text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I went to eat at this place and suspiciously after using my credit card two transactions appear with the same card that I paid, I am not 100% sure that the waitress had to see something, and I am not affirming anything, I only comment to others customers so they don't use cards to pay and carry cash .....
