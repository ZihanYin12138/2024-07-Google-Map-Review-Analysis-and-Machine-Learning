We came in the same day,  and she was very helpful in getting us the car we wanted. Valerie is awesome & straight forward! We  definitely recommend Ramos auto if you’re looking for a car or trying to build your credit she was really helpful. Thanks again!!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Awesome service I cant thank Valerie enough for making it possible to walk out with the truck I ended up wanting. She was very helpful and worked with what i could afford even showed me different cars and an estimate of how much each would cost. I really have had trouble buying a car because I dont have much credit history and no cosigner but with some down payment Valerie had me out with my truck in no time.</review>

<Text>***Horrible Service, Vehicle purchase stop working with in 2 weeks. Supervisor in charge is always on vacation and unable to get a clear answer. ****DO NOT PURCHASE****. The transaction is done via text between the sale person and "supervisor"  Poor communication and service. My vehicle is stopped and there is no sign of them helping with repairs or agreement. I will be proceeding with filing a formal complain  BBB.***</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< GmapID>

They have the worst cars. I purchased a vehicle and 2 days later it broke down on me...now a year later the vehicle has more issues and parts of the vehicle are jus flying off..I had a few more months to pay off this car but I had to let it go. It was repossessed which was the beat option since I no longer wanted to invest in this vehicle. I will never go back to this place nor recommend this place to anyone. They are nice but anyone is nice when they are trying to sell you a car and they are even nicer when they know what they are selling you is a piece of s*%t ! It’s sad because I felt taken advantage of..the car shouldn’t have been sold there were so many things wrong with it...

I wrote this review in hope that this will help anyone looking to go there ..don’t do it!! U will regret it<//review>

<Review>No idea how these people have so many good reviews. I'm guessing a lot of them are fake. They post cars on the app Offer Up for super low prices when they don't even have the car anymore, just to get you to come down.  NEVER go here to buy car. Watch a few more fake 5 star reviews pop up after i post this too. This place is a total scam joint. Run away..<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2ce95d277b4bf:0x59cadf3fecb96afa</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I just want to say that Miguel and Valerie  are awesome they are  very nice  and have a beautiful attitude number one. Number two they are very helpful any question that we had were answer appropriately and we had a chat like we knew each other he even gave me  tips to fix my credit which was an extra ⭐️ to there review. 3rd of all we came out very happy with our new Chevy Silverado every thing that we ask was fix and accomplish to our satisfaction which make us more happy so I will highly recommend you to them and the dealer as well Ramos auto sales are best thank you !<//text>

<Text>All of their cars are overpriced. The car I saw was In okay condition and the price was still $1800 more than the maximum amount suggested Kelly Blue Book. I am glad to say that I got the same car for a lot less than what they wanted. You’re better off looking elsewhere.<//Text>< userid>

The little old man is rude. He gets mad when you ask questions about the car lol
Old models for about 15,000 after the interest kicks in. They keep telling me I was going to keep getting the same price anywhere eles . Thing is I don't mind paying 15,000 , just  not for 2009 model with 100,000 miles. I feel you can do way better somewhere eles.</Review>

<text>All I needed was for them to check my blood pressure. Because my home monitor was saying it was 215/210. But they would not do it because  I could not show proof of a negative covid test i took almost two months ago. Which I took not because i got exposed,but my job required it. Keep in  mind that there was no one else in the facility.<//text>< rate>

The waiting area and treatment room was clean. Dr. was nice and helpful. Called my antibiotics in right away. I was maybe there 30 minutes. Couldn’t be more impressed. Great place with great care. Hope they get more business so they stick around. Better than any other place I have been to for immediate healthcare in the valley. Highly recommend for the whole family.<//Review></record>

I'm giving this place a one star because on the Google website it says it's open but when I went to the actual place, it was temporarily closed. They should put on their website that this specific area is closed. Waste of my time.</text>

I hit my head didn't think it was severe enough to go to the ER so came here. Went in the doctor put on her gloves and didn't even inspect my head at all which I thought was odd and just stood there talking to me recommended I get an Xray and they said someone would be there the next day, they told me to just walk in at 11:00 and they called me the next day and told me if I was still going to make it on time for my appointment at 11:30 when they didn't even give me an appointment card nor was the time 11:30 even mentioned they just told me to walk in. They said they should getv the results back and would gyve me a call the next day, next day came nothing so I called myself and told me everything looked okay. I've been there twice and doesn't seem like it's busy so I don't understand why they wouldn't call me.< /Text>

<text>I couldn't be more appreciative of California Urgent Care, it's wonderful staff and the premium experience I was fortunate to undergo during my several visits.

Not only are the staff kind, professional and caring, wait times are minimal, registration is quick and easy and the doctor/nurse practitioner shows genuine concern for your health.

I was seen to by Dr Watipaso Ziba who has to be the most ideal medical professional I have ever dealt with. She is deeply invested in patient care and treatment and carries a pleasure in what she does. I felt her empathy and desire to receive my concerns and collaboratively work towards a holistic solution for treatment. As a foreigner being treated in the states I felt welcome, cared for and looked after. I am forever grateful to her and have recommended her to my friends and family here.

Kelly from the front desk was ever so kind and efficient in processing me each time, ensuring I was looked after, explaining to me the process along the way ( given health care in the states can become complicated in terms of access and billing).

Both these individuals are assets to this organisation and crucial to receiving the best in urgent health care.

Thank you again!< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1568325386576, 'text': 'Every person that walks through the California Urgent Care Center doors is treated with the utmost in care and respect - each patient is just as important to us!

2 hour wait!!! Only 4 total patients in building, and I know because I️ seen 2 be called back and 2 waiting with me. Intake took an hour!! For basic questions of health history and wanted dates or diagnosis of grandparent. Very long wait altogether for no help.< /Text>

We brought our daughter here last night at 7:30p There was NO ONE in the waiting room and NO ONE at the front desk. I began to sign my daughter in when "Antoinette" came from the back and said "We just saw our last patient." I said "You don't close for another 30 minutes, there's no one waiting." With the rudest attitude I have EVER heard come from a medical professional she then said "Well we have to clean the office and do charts. There were a lot of people seen today." The hours say open until 8pm, if they need time to "clean" and "do charts" why aren't the doors locked earlier and why do they not have a notice stating they will stop taking people at a specific time?? Remember, there was NO ONE else in the waiting room. So I asked her "So you're just going to turn us away?" And I can't make this last part up, her response was "Yup, pretty much." I have NEVER been so upset at how RUDE someone could be. Thankfully we found another Urgent Care that was open until 9pm. Granted the waiting room was full when we arrived and the wait was very long, I would go back there over Green Leaf anytime. The staff and Doctor stayed past closing to finish their patients, a whole hour past closing I might add. The only person they turned away was at 845pm and it was because there were over 10 people still waiting to be seen.<//text>

I arrived at 7 PM and was not seen. Apparently, The staff likes to leave on time because when I arrived I was asked if I had an appointment. I was told that they had three patients to see before me and they would be unable to assist me. Had I known that 7 o'clock was too late I would not of come.their Internet ad does not have any mention of how close to 8 PM One must be.</Text>

After waiting an hour to be seen when they only had a couple other patients, the PA tells us there is nothing wrong with her breathing. There was no doctor in sight. After exiting we realized we were the only patient left in the parking lot. 3 people that came after us had already been seen and left before us. 3 hispanic adults mind you. Not children. My husband and I are Caucasian in our mid 20's. It seems to be either because of our age or race they decided to neglect our baby. Despicable... We are taking her to the ER, because we don't doubt she was mis diagnosed.</Text>< user_id>

The facility was clean but it was extremely hot inside.  Staff were friendly at first until the NP in what I call "whacked out" at my traumatized daughter and then strangely refused to answer any of my questions.  This place has changed names many times in the last year and only have a PA and an NP for you to see.  There was a time during the old name they were having DEA licensing issues.

Best Bet is Aspen Medical or Ripon Urgent Care.  Both places treat with you with respect.  My daughter went to one of them after Greenleaf and was out in a half hour.< /review>

<review>This is an update to my wife's review from earlier this afternoon. After spending about 3 hours with an actual doctor at Memorial, we found out she was in fact MIS DIAGNOSED. Her oxygen was low, she has rsv, and she was in fact having retractions, which the moronic PA or Nurse Practitioner tried denying she had. She is lucky she didn't have pneumonia. She still needed an inhaler though. We will be contacting a lawyer. This place needs to be shut down.

She ended up having to be admitted overnight. We are damned lucky we went to the ER.</review><UserId.>103496446953924702165< /UserId.>< gmap_id>

I had the crazy bug that went around early March. My throat was so swollen I couldn’t talk or breathe without coughing. I haven’t seen a doctor in quite some time so my insurance [MediCal] was valid but ancient. Therefore the clinics couldn’t find me in the system. MedNow ended up charging me $150 just to be seen, I paid because I was desperate and needed to be okD for work the next day. They told me I wouldn’t be billed unless I had a procedure performed. I agreed. I asked if they’ll let me know what counts as a procedure and they said yes. Two months later I get a bill for $500! Just for a cotton swab ($17) and a bloodpressure check ($8) but they charged addition hundreds of dollars for the VISIT. Want to know what I was “Diagnosed” with ? ALERGIES. I know what allergies are and this wasn’t it. A week or so later I went to a REAL DOCTOR AND GOT SITUATED AND HELPED! DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE! I’d be surprised if they don’t sneak charges onto your insurance.<//Review>< pics>

Although it’s posted they are open on weekends, they weren’t on a Saturday at 10:30 AM. Disappointing to learn after you drive there.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>All I needed was for them to check my blood pressure. Because my home monitor was saying it was 215/210. But they would not do it because  I could not show proof of a negative covid test i took almost two months ago. Which I took not because i got exposed,but my job required it. Keep in  mind that there was no one else in the facility.<//review>< pics>

Best urgent care I have ever been to. The doctor is very helpful and makes sure you understand everything and that all your questions are answered. And they are very fast. I do not regret switching to you guys. I will go here from now on.<//Review>

Went in on a Saturday morning at 10am. No wait. Literally no one else there. Staff was really nice and personable. The waiting area and treatment room was clean. Dr. was nice and helpful. Called my antibiotics in right away. I was maybe there 30 minutes. Couldn’t be more impressed. Great place with great care. Hope they get more business so they stick around. Better than any other place I have been to for immediate healthcare in the valley. Highly recommend for the whole family.</text>

I'm giving this place a one star because on the Google website it says it's open but when I went to the actual place, it was temporarily closed. They should put on their website that this specific area is closed. Waste of my time.< /Review>

<Text>I hit my head didn't think it was severe enough to go to the ER so came here. Went in the doctor put on her gloves and didn't even inspect my head at all which I thought was odd and just stood there talking to me recommended I get an Xray and they said someone would be there the next day, they told me to just walk in at 11:00 and they called me the next day and told me if I was still going to make it on time for my appointment at 11:30 when they didn't even give me an appointment card nor was the time 11:30 even mentioned they just told me to walk in. They said they should getv the results back and would gyve me a call the next day, next day came nothing so I called myself and told me everything looked okay. I've been there twice and doesn't seem like it's busy so I don't understand why they wouldn't call me.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1560815210966, 'text': 'Hi Everardo, we are sorry for your unfavorable experience.

<text>I couldn't be more appreciative of California Urgent Care, it's wonderful staff and the premium experience I was fortunate to undergo during my several visits.

Not only are the staff kind, professional and caring, wait times are minimal, registration is quick and easy and the doctor/nurse practitioner shows genuine concern for your health.

I was seen to by Dr Watipaso Ziba who has to be the most ideal medical professional I have ever dealt with. She is deeply invested in patient care and treatment and carries a pleasure in what she does. I felt her empathy and desire to receive my concerns and collaboratively work towards a holistic solution for treatment. As a foreigner being treated in the states I felt welcome, cared for and looked after. I am forever grateful to her and have recommended her to my friends and family here.

Kelly from the front desk was ever so kind and efficient in processing me each time, ensuring I was looked after, explaining to me the process along the way ( given health care in the states can become complicated in terms of access and billing).

Both these individuals are assets to this organisation and crucial to receiving the best in urgent health care.

Thank you again!< /text><Resp>{'time': 1568325386576, 'text': 'Every person that walks through the California Urgent Care Center doors is treated with the utmost in care and respect - each patient is just as important to us!

We brought our daughter here last night at 7:30p There was NO ONE in the waiting room and NO ONE at the front desk. I began to sign my daughter in when "Antoinette" came from the back and said "We just saw our last patient." I said "You don't close for another 30 minutes, there's no one waiting." With the rudest attitude I have EVER heard come from a medical professional she then said "Well we have to clean the office and do charts. There were a lot of people seen today." The hours say open until 8pm, if they need time to "clean" and "do charts" why aren't the doors locked earlier and why do they not have a notice stating they will stop taking people at a specific time?? Remember, there was NO ONE else in the waiting room. So I asked her "So you're just going to turn us away?" And I can't make this last part up, her response was "Yup, pretty much." I have NEVER been so upset at how RUDE someone could be. Thankfully we found another Urgent Care that was open until 9pm. Granted the waiting room was full when we arrived and the wait was very long, I would go back there over Green Leaf anytime. The staff and Doctor stayed past closing to finish their patients, a whole hour past closing I might add. The only person they turned away was at 845pm and it was because there were over 10 people still waiting to be seen.< /Text>

I arrived at 7 PM and was not seen. Apparently, The staff likes to leave on time because when I arrived I was asked if I had an appointment. I was told that they had three patients to see before me and they would be unable to assist me. Had I known that 7 o'clock was too late I would not of come.their Internet ad does not have any mention of how close to 8 PM One must be.< /review>

<Text>DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR. My husband and I brought our 2 year old in for a fever and difficulty breathing today. After waiting an hour to be seen when they only had a couple other patients, the PA tells us there is nothing wrong with her breathing. There was no doctor in sight. After exiting we realized we were the only patient left in the parking lot. 3 people that came after us had already been seen and left before us. 3 hispanic adults mind you. Not children. My husband and I are Caucasian in our mid 20's. It seems to be either because of our age or race they decided to neglect our baby. Despicable... We are taking her to the ER, because we don't doubt she was mis diagnosed.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>The facility was clean but it was extremely hot inside.  Staff were friendly at first until the NP in what I call "whacked out" at my traumatized daughter and then strangely refused to answer any of my questions.  This place has changed names many times in the last year and only have a PA and an NP for you to see.  There was a time during the old name they were having DEA licensing issues.

Best Bet is Aspen Medical or Ripon Urgent Care.  Both places treat with you with respect.  My daughter went to one of them after Greenleaf and was out in a half hour.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>This is an update to my wife's review from earlier this afternoon. After spending about 3 hours with an actual doctor at Memorial, we found out she was in fact MIS DIAGNOSED. Her oxygen was low, she has rsv, and she was in fact having retractions, which the moronic PA or Nurse Practitioner tried denying she had. She is lucky she didn't have pneumonia. She still needed an inhaler though. We will be contacting a lawyer. This place needs to be shut down.

She ended up having to be admitted overnight. We are damned lucky we went to the ER.</text><Rate>1<//Rate>< username>

<Review>PLEASE read the reviews and take the empty waiting room as hint.
I had the crazy bug that went around early March. My throat was so swollen I couldn’t talk or breathe without coughing. I haven’t seen a doctor in quite some time so my insurance [MediCal] was valid but ancient. Therefore the clinics couldn’t find me in the system. MedNow ended up charging me $150 just to be seen, I paid because I was desperate and needed to be okD for work the next day. They told me I wouldn’t be billed unless I had a procedure performed. I agreed. I asked if they’ll let me know what counts as a procedure and they said yes. Two months later I get a bill for $500! Just for a cotton swab ($17) and a bloodpressure check ($8) but they charged addition hundreds of dollars for the VISIT. Want to know what I was “Diagnosed” with ? ALERGIES. I know what allergies are and this wasn’t it. A week or so later I went to a REAL DOCTOR AND GOT SITUATED AND HELPED! DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE! I’d be surprised if they don’t sneak charges onto your insurance.< /Review>< Pics>

Maria Oaks was absolutely the WORST doctor I have ever been to.  Made me wait in the doctors office for 3 hours then was extremely rude from the moment she walked in the door for my appointment.  Avoid seeing her at all costs.</review>

I called stating I had chest pain a few hours ago and needed an EKG. They sent me to the branch on Carpenter Road. After filling out the paperwork and waiting for twenty minutes I was told the location I was sent to did not have an EKG machine. The unit I called for my appointment did.

Obviously the person answering the phone making appointment and performing Triage has no idea what they are doing.

I wasn't impressed to fill out paperwork, wait in the lobby, then discover they didn't have the equipment to perform the test I told them that I needed.< /Review>

I tell him and he goes why havent you taken her to her doctor i go i did two wks ago...he goes well why u here? Me dumbfounded like is this guy for real....i say because her doctor closed and i want to check her ear...he says this makes me very leery, like i am not going to go against your doctor...me....what are u talking about i just want to see if she developed infection in her ear....he goes on to say i have been doing this for 45yrs and i just aint comfortable wkg on your child...my baby is down syndrome...( first taste of discrimination) i just looked at him like are u setious? I say u know what thays fine....he goes take her to er..i go she doesnt need er...i get the baby and start to walk out in disgust n shock.

I began to do some upgrades at my home.  Not knowing anything about hardwoods I had questions. The staff at Aura were knowledgeable. Andrew was very professional, helpful and friendly who explained some of the differences of hardwood from the questions I had .  The rest of the crew were great as well.  Very friendly and polite.  Their selection of good quality hardwood impressed me.< /review>

I have been here couple of times. The price is good, but I really had a hard time to sort through the lumbers available. For each type, e.g. cherry or red oak 5/4 or 6/4, you have about 10-15 to select from but most of them are not straight enough - there must be a lot of people selecting from the pile. For some variaties, there is none..e.g. white oak. The mostly available ones are 4/4 red oak and walnut..<//Review>

We've been milling and purchasing lumber for/from Aura Hardwoods for several years.  RPM is in contact with one or more of their branches on a daily basis, either for milling or purchasing. Each and every branch has good people working for them, from the office to the drivers to the managers of each branch.  Each employee is professional, knowledgeable, friendly and truly a pleasure to do business with. I can't speak highly enough about Aura Hardwoods staff!< /text>

Amazing place to get inspired for your next project. This shop has so many lovely options and the staff there went above and beyond in terms of service. This was my first trip, and they took their time to explain how things were organized and helped me hunt down a particular type of lumber I had seen on their website.

I am not a professional, but a passionate DIY-er, and I didn't feel that my "non-pro" status was held against me in terms of the time the staff took to help me find my way around. Special thanks to Andrew and Robert for your help.</Review>

Good prices for hardwoods with a wide range of thicknesses.  Most of their pieces are 8-10 feet and they only sell the entire piece.  They'll cut down hardwood but they won't cut down plywood.  They don't carry much stock of figured or live edge wood.< /text>

The differences from the big box stores are quality, selection, and size. Bring the big truck or a saw, because they don't cut pieces or sheets. But they're the only place in town with high quality Canadian 3mm MDF, so it's worth tying 4x8' sheets to my roof rails. You aren't going to get planks of walnut or purple heart at the home improvement warehouses either.</Text>

Visited El Mariachi's for a special occasion. They have done in and was a good choice for us. The food was good, served hot (careful, the plates are very hot). Wait time from order to food wasn't horrible, being as 12 others arrived before our family arrived. The restaurant was fairly busy. They do limit capacity and take precautions. We felt safe eating here.<//review>

<text>Just got an order delivered it was only 2 meals of pollo le crema, the exact same but with no onions and mushrooms in mine. Mine meal was 1/4 of the amount of my boyfriends, and my boyfriends onions were nothing but hand sized undercooked pieces of onions cores. Work on your food consistency.</text>< user>

Restaurant seating / atmosphere and crew was nice, but there are plenty of other Mexican places in redding with much better food. Wasn't a fan of the Tortilla chips also</Review>

< Review>
My family and I have been a customer at Mariachis for many many years. I am a creature of habit and I ALWAYS order the same thing 😆  I absolutely love their #3 combination. Which is the Enchiladas with a side of beans and rice. I go there especially because they've got the Best Enchilada sauce and if you want Delivery,they actually give you so much food you ALWAYS have enough for leftovers!!!!!! There's only one other Mexican restaurant comparable to them here in Redding but they don't give you as much food to go and they don't Deliver😍😍😘😘😜<//Review>

At a time like this, I highly encourage everyone to take there business too this local restaurant for outside dining and take out. These guys deserve it; putting up with a family of nine, including two children, and they were very patient and very friendly. It was one of the first times we've all had the chance to eat and see each other since this Covid lockdown, and a large thank you goes out to El Mariachi's for the amazing help.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

El Mariachi's is a fun restaurant to visit! The atmosphere is Mexican family style. The waiter staff is very welcoming and nice! The menu is an extensive list of favorite Mexican dishes. The food is authentic and made with quality ingredients. We often go in a large party and El Mariachi's always accommodates us! They offer a salsa bar, and serve great drinks!< /text>

This was one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been too ever. The waitress took some of the best care of me I've ever had at any restaurant. The food was on par and full of delicious flavors. I stumbled into this place on new year's eve after a long day of work. Everything else in town was closed. I was driving for about 20 minutes looking for something in a town that I am new in. I seen the open light on and went in. After the experience I had at this place tonight I dont really care to look into going to any other mexican restaurant in town. Finding this place was like winning the Mexican food lottery.<//text>

It has a few highs and a few lows. The chips were good but the salsa tasted from a can not fresh,  the tortillas were not hand made. The guacamole was good. But the carnita tasted dry. The plate I got was badly chipped on the side. The personal was friendly.<//review>

Food was gross and bland. My friend ordered a quesadilla and the cheese wasn’t even melted and the chicken was super watery that it soaked the whole tortilla. Guadalajara is so much better. Save your money.<//review>

Great food in large servings. This place is family friendly, in the sense that the staff made us feel incredibly welcome; our large-ish group was treated as family.</text>

This use to be our favorite restaurant for Mexican,  but this time it was not good,  salsa tasted like a can of tomato sauce,  the carnita was over cooked.  Very disappointed!!☹</text>

< Review>
I do not like leaving bad reviews, that being said this place needs it. The waitress that initially sat us and took our order was friendly. Then things just went downhill from there. There was only one other person in the restaurant ordering food and it took a really long time for our order to arrive, when it did my wife's food was cold and my order was wrong. My food did not taste good at all. I was able to eat my beans and one enchilada because I was incredibly hungry. Then it took forever to get our bill and by the time we payed and got out to our car I vomited. I then vomited 6 more times at home. My wife who only ate a small portion of her cold food was  nauseous but thankfully didn't eat enough to get sick like I did.  I recommend trying somewhere else if your craving Mexican food.<//Review>

Excellent food, service, and a salsa bar are what makes this place awesome. I really like the interior design as well.  All the staff are super friendly and courteous.  The place is neat and clean.  If you've never tried El Mariachi's I highly recommend it!< /review>

Has been our "go to" in the past, but they have changed. Chips do not seem fresh, flavors are not as good. We will try them a few more times. I am sad for their downgrade.</Text>

The food is athletic for the most part but was not up to my standards. Seating is bad in most parts of the restaurant and seems abandoned most of the time. On a good note they have great deals for your children.</Text>

<Review>They made my order wrong and then didnt take responsibility for it. Blamed it one everyone else involved. When i spoke to the manager he didnt even attempt to fix the problem.

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Nachos were dry and over baked (ate maybe 6 chips) quesadilla supreme with shredded beef was just a shredded pot roast that even had the bay leaf in it still whole inside the quesadilla (ate 2 bites) Chile rellano was disgusting. Only thing we had was a side enchilada and a coke. Server didn't ask why we didn't eat anything nothing was comped so enchilada and a coke (which a refill was never offered) cost 40 bucks. Never going again.< /Review>< Pictures>

I just had the best dining experience I've ever had at El Mariachi's. Rad waitress with short dark hair, I think she had braces, only one there tonight. She knew everything we needed and more without having to ask!!<//review>

The food was very flavorful.  Service to notch.  Best restaurant of this type I've found so far in the Redding area.  Had a wet burrito and it was worth ordering and the price was reasonable.</Review>

The food was okay, not overly impressive. I had the Pollo Cancun, it lacked an overt flavor profile. The chips and salsa were good. However I was hoping for a less bland sauce and flavor to the Pollo dish.<//Text>

Best Micheladas in town, awesome authentic food at a reasonable price. My new favorite!

Update 10/15/2020. Got Chimichangas again. They were massive, the length of my arm from wrist to elbow. See my pic that I uploaded, this place is no joke. Absolutely delicious ground beef.< /Review>

Amazing!  We came with a group of 6 at 940 pm (they close at 10pm) they welcomed  us and we're patient.  The food was great  and Portion size  was way more than expected 😀 I definitely  recommend  them!<//Text>

The food is good, and the prices are fair, but the reason this is my favorite mexican restaurant is because of the service: everyone is super friendly, and the food comes quick!  The servers are attentive, and would bend over backward to make sure you are happy.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>This is our go to Mexican restaurant and also our default take out option when we've had a busy day.

We sit down here once every couple months, but normally just order take-out or entree express. We've never had a bad meal here, the food is always good, and there is A LOT of it. Cheap too, we spend about an average of $30 - $40 for a family of four, including two 10 year old boys with hollow legs.

The atmosphere is welcoming and traditional, they always have drink specials, and they have a killer salsa bar. (Almost literally once... the green paste is NOT avocado, it's pureed jalapenos lol, yikes)

The boys always split a machos nachos, which is steak fries smothered  in nacho cheese and all the fixins. Not necessarily Mexican food, but they really like it. I recommend the rolled taquitos, and hubby always gets some sort of burrito smothered in some sort of sauce. (I'm extremely observant, I know) We always have leftovers for lunch the next day.

I highly recommend El Mariachis. It's good food and it's cheap. And there are so many ways to get it, whether going in, calling and picking it up, or having it delivered. (That's $8 extra tho)

There is no way that this restaurant can be rated 4 stars.  We had a very bad experience with the food.  The server was great and very welcoming but the food quality was no good.  It seems as if they don't know what traditional Mexican food is.< /Review>

Just made a delivery order. Paid the service delivery lady. Sat down with family to eat.  And there is no rice and beans.  I immediately called back to the restaurant and told him we were not given any rice and beans.  He said the lady who took your order said we didn't want any.  This was not true.  Then he wanted me to pay for the rice and beans and the extra service delivery charge a second time, if we still wanted the rice and beans. Food wise, the carne asadas drip lots of greasy oil and are very salty.< /text>

<review>This evening I was struck by a need for Tacos.  Not wanting to go out, I ordered delivery from this establishment, and was sorely disappointed.

I wanted 6 tacos.  I got 4.
I wanted no veggies (because I'm odd like that).  That left just a taco shell and the meat.  No cheese?  No sour cream or anything?  At $2.99 per carne asada taco, that's some poor value.
Then I find the "chicken" tacos are a mix of shredded chicken and various plant matter that make an unwanted mush.  Would have been nice to know when I was making the order.  $2.25 per taco wasted.
I wanted hard shells, but the two carne asada were soft tacos.  I didn't specify, that one's on me.

So, I just paid $18.23 for a handful of carne asada and two soft corn tortillas to be delivered.  Not counting the tip to the driver, whom was friendly and not at fault.

Guess who's not going to patronize this place anymore?</review><Rating>2</Rating><userid>112489946344143379063<//userid>< Pics>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>Awful service, false advertising! We went there Sunday after church because of the "kids eat for $1". Gabriel offered terrible service by not coming to our table, getting us our drinks, sides, and charged us full price for the kids meal because "the owner said to".

<Review>First time here and I would go back but make an appointment next time. I waited about 30 minutes before they realized I was waiting. Once they got me seated they asked detailed questions on how I'd like my hair to be cut and gave me options. I like how my hair came out. she even styled it for me. The cut was $19 so not bad of a price<//Review>< Pictures>

Supercuts is a hair salon run by superheroes. The employees are not allowed to call themselves superheroes due to specific legality issues with the state but if you look closely, you’ll recognize some of the superheroes cutting your hair. You have to look closely though or you won’t get a Supercut. It’ll just be a haircut that you overpaid.< /Review>

Excellent PT venue!! Fabulous folks at the reception desk that greet you, make appointments, & sort out insurance...especially Patty. Excellent therapist named Emily! The PT assistants are smiling, upbeat, & helpful. The physical location is light with big windows & open spaces. The patients encourage each other. If you have to have PT, this is the place to go.< /Review>

Best therapists around.  Run well.  Very clean.  Good scheduling.  Good teamwork.  I don't know where I'd be without them! Can I give them 6 stars?<//Review>

"The Tops,  I've had some injury issues throughout my life.  Most of which have led me to needing Physical Therapy. Well hands down,  I've been treated throughout many facilities throughout the sfv and by far Vargo Physical Therapy has been the best!  Modern Technology /Equipment, Friendly Knowledgeable Staff,  Early Morning hrs. I don't enjoy physical therapy,  but if I have to then it has to be "VARGO PHYSICAL THERAPY! "😉👍</Text>

< Review>
Staff is very nice but Hyper.  I like the store.  They have a great deal of variety, as this is a big store.  You can usually find what you are looking for; where as other locations sell out quicker and receive less merchandise.   I would give a 5* rating if Amber were still the Store Manager, But Becky the new manager is NOT an asset to the store.  She is snippy and doesn't want to bother with you, as a customer.  I went in the day after Christmas and asked about a specific Wallflower scent.  She brushed me off and pointed to a table.  I walked around the store and after 5 minutes found the item on a table way across the store.  It's a shame to have her on board because it's a good store otherwise.<//Review>

Need to get a woman a gift and have no idea where to or what to get?  Bath & Body Works is the place for you!  Who doesn’t love candles and smelly stuff?  They always have deals going on too, so it’s the perfect place for your holiday shopping.< /text>

Went to buy some stuff from their semi annual sale. They barely had anything at this store. Left the store without buying. Try other bigger stores as they have more inventory</review>

This place is terrible. I had to wait an hour just to get a haircut and they attended customers that came after I arrived. One of the employees brought their kid and that kid was loud and misbehaved. My haircut came out decent. Overall, don't bother coming here. Go somewhere better</review>

<review>The Upper Hand is incredible. Their level of professionalism all while making you feel absolutely comfortable makes this place awesome. This team doesn't just do the bare minimum and rush you out - the entire staff GENUINELY cares about your treatments and using products that work and fit best for you. I've never been to a salon that cares this deeply for each person who walks through their doors. If I had the money I would come here every day! Lisa is amazing and wants each person to feel cared for and pampered like royalty. 12/10 recommend. ALSO the Farm House Fresh products they have here are HEAVENLY!!! Amazing Salon!< /review>< pictures>

Today was my first day visiting The Upper Hand and let me just tell you, I was WOWED!! Not only does it smell heavenly, but all the ladies pride themselves on making you feel at home. I was able to relax and enjoy myself. Karina did an awesome job on my toes and really took her time, you can tell she takes pride in her work.

Today I had the pleasure of having a mini facial with Taylor. It was such a treat! Not only did she make me feel super comfortable, but she had a gentle but firm hand. The products she used smelled amazing, and it left me relaxed but intrigued to come back for a full facial. Thank you Taylor<//review>

Went with the full pamper pedicure (farmhouse fresh pedi) and was not disappointed!!  Lisa did both my gel mani and pedi and both were amazing.  Everyone at the salon was super friendly and welcoming.  Big shout out to Upper Hand, I will recommend to friends/family in the San Diego area.  Thank you ladies!!< /Review>

Lisa did a phenomenal job I love my pedicure. She explained with detail how to care for my feet since I am a diabetic, she did a better job explaining than the medical spa I use to go to. I will definitely recommend her to friends and family. She has earned a life long customer.</text>

<review>I love The upper Hand Spa Salon. Lisa (the owner) is very friendly, and she prides herself on  the quality of services provided to every single one of her clients. My nails never looked better! True spa feeling♥. Her Spa is beautiful, clean, and offers an array quality products. I went to her Spa Boutique at Christmas time to purchase some products to be gifted to some of my clients. My clients loved  the candles, hand lotions, body oils, etc.<//review><resp>{'time': 1619239577334, 'text': 'Thank you Lily!!

<Text>Not recommended. They let people show up late to their appointments and pushes other people appointments to wait for that person to finish.  Then I received "jokes" about still getting done on time because I was last of the day...which made me feel like I was less important and question if I got the full experience. Because my pedicure was delayed that delayed my facial again making me feel like I was being rushed through it. When came out of the room no one else was there and lights were off. Got in my car to find I still had mask on my face. SHE LET ME LEAVE WITH MASK ON MY FACE!!!! I knew I should have just left when my  10am appoinyment didn't start until after 1030am< /Text>< Rate>

We unfortunately can’t control other people’s actions, but she hit traffic. We try very hard to give everyone exceptional service each time. I was the last in and did turn overhead lights off in the boutique only since it was still light out. I won’t do that again since it was negative to you. I did leave all the other lights on. I will check into the mask being left on !! Not acceptable even at 50% off. I would love to chat because as an owner who is very passionate about my business I do not want anything like this to ever happen again!!! I hope you can accept my sincere apologies.'}< /resp>

What an amazing salon.  I have been getting my nails done by Lisa for 10 years.  She is so wonderful. Her salon is so clean and nice.  Today I had my first facial by Jessica.  I feel so relaxed and refreshed.  Would highly recommend The Upoer Hand Spa for all your beauty needs.  Don’t look any further!< /Review>

Just had one of the best experiences at Upper Hand Spa, the whole team is welcoming. Karina is amazing and a perfectionist, she was not done until my toes and feet looked perfect! The products they use are incredible, cruelty free, natural, and smell amazing. Looking forward next to my service.<//Text>

<text>Coming to the Upper Hand Spa is a genuine spa experience.  The spa is pristinely clean, with private rooms and soothing music.  You won't see crowds here waiting for their turn or talking on their phones.  The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing, and it always smells nice inside.

Lisa is a true professional who specializes in providing exactly how you want your nails to look.  She has a great selection of colors, and uses products with low odor.  I always leave the Upper Hand Salon relaxed and looking forward to my next visit.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I am beyond happy I found Lisa at The Upper Hand. I can honestly say it’s the BEST manicure and pedicure I have ever had and trust me I’ve had quite a few. Super impressed with the products and entire salon. I’m a forever customer!!😍< /Review></record>

< Review>
The Upper Hand Spa Salon is the only place I go! Their amazing pedicures and facials are my favorite but they have many other services I can't wait to try.  I get all my Farmhouse Fresh skin care products from them and my skin has never looked better. I am 48 years old but my skin looks younger and healthier than it did when I was 38! This place is more than a salon, it's a safe haven for anyone who needs a little zen, peace, and tranquility while indulging in some self care.< /Review>

<text>Wow! This is by far the BEST mani/pedi/eyebrow experience I have ever had! The staff and owner are amazing, great people. Wonderful, peaceful environment. Even the products are excellent (natural, non-toxic, etc). My typical mani/pedi experience has always been hectic, even stressful. Not how it should be.. My nails became weak from the chemicals, as I found when salons were closed due to covid, my unmanicured nails were actually becoming healthier, stronger. For just a little more $ you can have a healthy, relaxing experience here. Well worth it!!!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I had my first pedi at The Upper Hand Spa Salon with Lisa. It was the most wonderful experience I’ve ever had getting a pedi! Lisa is awesome and uses only the best products. I had the Farmhouse pedi done and my feet have never looked so good and felt so healthy! Very professional and knowledgeable and I will definitely be back. Even though we had to be outside with this pandemic going on, the pampering was amazing! Thank you Lisa!<//text>

Upper Hand Spa has amazing treatments and the staff are professional, thoughtful, and provide the best services! I feel pampered every time I go! I also love their Farmhouse Fresh products. They are natural and they all have the most wonderful fragrances.
I will return regularly for pedicures and treatments from the estheticians ☺️</Review>

Upperhand Salon in La Mesa is such great Salon. I love getting my pedicures and nails done here and I’m really looking forward to getting that massage and facial I had booked, until lockdown! I also love the products they use ( Farmhouse Fresh )and love purchasing them for home and gifts for my friends!!< /review>

The entrance has two doors, allowing you to walk through one, be still, and enter into the foyer with the other. Farmhouse Fresh products line the shelves and the estheticians are knowledgeable on what each product will help you with. In addition, there are 2 private mani/pedi rooms, creating your own pampering bubble. Soon, a make up station will be available, helping us match our foundation and all the rest of the goodies we have questions with! I've gone here for years and LOVE their new location in La Mesa!<//Review></record>

The chicken is excellent. The French fries were good too. I didn't get to try the potato salad or macaroni salad, so I plan on returning their soon so that I can.</Text>

The crunch and spice blend on their food is perfect.  Not oily and holds up well to get it home to eat! Photo is the 2pcs + 1 side and I had 1 shrimp left from a 4 piece side order. Great pricing also!</Review>

<Text>In my opinion, this is the best fried chicken place in the AV. The chicken is never over or under cooked and always super crispy with great flavor. Giving 4 stars though because of the sides. Not a lot of options and the sides that they do have are mediocre. This place is definitely a must try though< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c259b8c8db90f7:0xd810e22538d7f707< /GmapID></record>

Ive been coming here for years. But yesterday I went got my normal pieces of chicken and as i ate my chicken I kept getting a fishy taste as if the chicken was fried in fish grease. The taste was so strong I ended up having a allergic reaction and the cookies i bought was so old. Just real disappointed.</text>

Rating is for the food and service only.  The facilities are in a sketchy location and the building is a dump.  None of that matters though because the awesome chicken is where at.  This is indeed as good as grandma used to make.  Best chicken in town for sure. The lady that I always see at the counter is nice friendly and fast.  Very fair prices. I got a 3 piece with a side and a cola for less than 8 bucks. Terrific deal.  Don't let the location deter you.  Go and you won't regret your choice.<//Review>

Place is pretty good. Prices ain't bad and they are not sparing when they serve your meals, they load it up (literally filled bag of fries and tenders) so you get more bang for your buck! One serious place for a good go-to for some good fried food.< /review>

This place is amazing!   The chicken and the shrimp taste so good.   The only reason for four stars not five is that they are cash only.</text>

The food is delicious. The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired, and the wait can be a bit long, but you get fresh, hot delicious food for a good price. The shrimp especially was fresh and plump considering what I paid for it, and was divine both battered and in the tasty gumbo. I enjoyed everything, and will go back again. One warning: no chicken/seafood combos, if you want that you will have to order a combo of one and a la carte the other.<//text>

The food here is delicious! I live in Vegas and every time I come to Palmdale I have to stop by this place. It is a must! If I could copy the seasonings I would be rich. From the fish the chicken wings, chicken tenders, shrimp, and egg rolls all delicious!< /Review>

The place is also pretty nasty. This place needs a good cleaning or a visit from the health inspectors. Service is the only positive aspect of this place. As others noted sketchy strip mall location.</Review>< Date>

This Louisiana chicken may not have changed owners in over 20 years but the quality definitely has changed. The shrimp was over cooked and is way smaller than it used to be. They only carry one kind of fish that I haven’t even heard of and all the food is super greasy. The only good thing I can say is that the spice blend used in the chicken, shrimp and fish is still very tasty.</text>

Before I used to always go to pollo loco, KFC, or shakeys for chicken but pollo loco and KFC have changed alot. I was told about this place by a worker at 711 I had always seen it but never stopped to get a bite. Well now that I tried it OMG its soo good my first week of being there I was there every other day. The fries are bomb too but that chicken 😍💕</review>

So every time that me or my husband wants to do something special we always start with LOUISIANA,  love the dinner rolls and the French fries are the best and I like also when they have specials or Combo Specials... no matter what day of the week, if we feel like to have LOUISIANA, we just go and get it,  I recommend it to anybody, is the best 😃👍<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I’m very upset that they have online that they close a 8:30 pm but closed at 7:30 pm an hour early that makes no sense and than when I ask about it they have no reason as to why so if you plan eating here just know you don’t what time they actually close cause it appears they close when they want to with no explanation< /text>

Ive been eating here since they were near t-shirt and casuals. I love them. They are always friendly and funny. And the food is amazing. Reminds me of my original spot in LA on manchester 😉. Better order before going in though.<//Text>

<text>I love this particular Louisiana Fried chicken. They offer egg rolls which is filled with chicken. They're always cooking to order, no heat lamp for old chicken. The staff is knowledgeable for their regular customers they know what you want when you walk through the door.</text><rating>5<//rating><date>1528853828246</date><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>102141466128749922381</UserId.>< name>

Me and my wife always come here and get the 10 piece nuggets with  french fries. Sokane is VERY funny and sweet. We come just to see her.  And everything has good seasoning on it, as if a black person made it. Lol. Keep up the good work.</Text>

Nothing like the Louisiana Cajun/Creole Cuisine I grew up loving, and not even close to the Lagniappe I am accustomed to. I came from."Luzianna", and it's not bad food here, but this menu is extremely pretentious<//Text>

April 12th 2014 I ordered a three piece meal with fries I gave her six dollars and a tip. When I got to my baseball game which is a couple minutes away I open my bag and all I had was too small wings and one leg. on the menu it says you get one thigh one leg and one wing a little bit of fries. I  called the restaurant and the lady who answered the phone told me that they ran out of thighs and they had no more legs all they had was wings the problem is she failed to tell me. I received a little bit of food for $6 and I have extra for tip, I feel cheated. She didn't even apologize. The fries tasted old and hard as well.<//text>

Can't beat the seasoning but I tried to call ahead to order and the person that I spoke to (Saturday November 7th, 2015 at 8:24 pm) said that the restaurant closes at 8:30. I was confused to find out that they actually don't close until 9:30 as listed on their website.</text>

<text>I celebrated my PhD last night in this fine place. I am glad to say that we enjoyed a outstanding evening and the place was no doubt one of the reasons for the happy celebration. The stuff  collaborated in a lovely style, the food was tasty and my friends were very  glad. We shall surely return for more events. Thank you very much.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< gmap_id>

The customer service at this location seems so nonchalant. I order my food and the cashier Jennifer looks off into space to find the meaning of life. When my food was ready she yells my number and walks away to laugh with a co-worker leaving the bag unattended. WTF is that? This is a area filled with homeless who could just snatch a free meal. Then I have to wait around for her to come back to be able to ask for condiments. This place is definitely not known for their service. Avoid it.</text>

The service here was bad i waited in line to order. I was the next one when started to order the female taking order told me  hold on and started to take this pretty boys order first he just got there and didnt have to wait like everyone else. I went to complain to magment who didnt seem to care ormdoma thing. This is the last time i ever come to any burgerking. Not to mention  it looked dirty not kempt in there. Cant imagine what it looks like where they make the food.<//Review>

So while enjoying my dine-in experience, the gentleman however not in uniform wearing blue jeans and a white t-shirt is sweeping the floor.   Though im grateful that he is in fact cleaning the dining area, he is also sweeping near the table that im sitting.  My immediate thought is, he might have not been properly informed that you never sweep a floor near a guest table, especially when their food on it that is also uncovered.  Overall customer service was good.< /review>

Definitely not as fast as they used to be, they seem very disorganized and understaffed. Always have long lines so prepare to wait a while until you get your food, and make sure you check your bag before you leave, they've forgotten my fries before. :(< /Review>

< Review>
First and last time going to this Burger King. The employees from this place are rude that like to chitchat and make fun of customers. Especially the older Hispanic lady, that works evening around fridays 6-ish pm. This incident occurred May 24 2019.at 5:16 pm. She made fun of a customer, my friend, for ordering a large “diet coke” with her food. She talked about it out loud and giggled to her other coworkers IN front of the customer!!! ordering the food. She said haha LArge fries WITh A DIET COKE?!!. Rude af. Also the place is dirty. Burger King should hire respectful people not chismosas.<//Review>

Ive gotten diet Pepsi instead of regular multiple times. Not sure if they do it on purpose but it's so frustrating to deal with this. I've had to come back quite a few times. Today took longer then usual to get someone to help me cuz everyone here seems lost. Definitely gonna have to remove this place off my map cuz it's not worth the trouble</Review></record></dataset><record>

Had horrible services at this Burger King. I was in the drive-thru for a long time so as everyone was reversing I did as well and decided to go check what is the hold
well this worker was playing around and had the place super dirty. My fries were burned And this cashier still try to argue with me about my order saying that I pay for a small and not a medium sized. But really really horrible crew members at Burger King in 1673 E 103rd St LA CA 90003 and like this-this people want to get paid $15 an hour< /Text>

it's okay the food is cheap and you can buy a lot of it and it will fill you up but between that and McDonald's actually going to McDonald's is a better choice but it's really far away the service here is always good though and fast</review>

The most getto Burger King I have ever visit, in this place people can drink beer and nobody will say anything, also the service is extremely slow and you have all kinds of characters yelling and screaming for no reason.< /review>

Very , very unpleasent. Laking in costumers satifaction . Which reminds me of the phrase, "The world is a beautiful place,it just the people in it, that makes it awful". The staff at this Buger King are very unprofessional. Don't eat there.<//Review>
