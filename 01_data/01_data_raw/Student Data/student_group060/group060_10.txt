For three years in a row they have messed up every picture order for fall and spring; either the pictures themselves (twice in one year they give me a photo with my daughters eyes closed first, and then on the retake she was mid-word when they told her to say something like unicorn; like you’re a photographer but somehow didn’t catch that in editing?) or the order is wrong/missing. This year they just completely didn’t give me my youngest daughters pictures even though they definitely took my money for them. It would be nice that at some point before my daughters finish school to get a picture order right, the first time. It gets old having to go back and forth with them twice a year, for fall and spring pictures. It’s not only the time I have to spend on it via phone, but in some cases it’s also scheduling *sometimes multiple* retakes. Going forward I wish schools would reconsider using this company. Or I just may have to skip having school pictures as a parent which is just sad. Hopefully I can get my pictures for my one daughter for this year, and then I won’t be giving them my business again.< /Text>

<review>The photographer was super friendly and patient. He listened to what my son's vision was for his photos and made him feel like a model. He joked with us and made it a fun environment rather than just a boring school picture session. Thanks for making these memories for us.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Where do I start. Bad quality prints where you can see horizontal lines from the cheap inkjet printer they use. My son's face is tilted up even though when taking the pictures he felt awkward and told the photographer he did not want to tilt his head upwards. His picture isn't even centered. When I framed it he is off center and can't see half of his shoulder. The other side where his shoulder is seen has backdrop showing. Good luck trying to get a hold of them too. It's amateur hour at this company. They're called studio 1? They can't even come up with a better name because they probably just change the number when getting so many complaints. Schools are cheaping out. I think all positive reviews are paid for. Even the posts with pics that ppl upload are terrible. Not focused and show a lot of background for no reason. Poor photographer and poor quality prints. I feel mislead and deceived. I want my money back!<//Text>< gmapID>

Friendly service, helpful and pictures are great quality. During senior pictures they are a little crazy because of the sheer volume and we haven't been pleased with the outcome enough to spend the $200 plus they charge for senior packages. But for all other portraits we have loved working with them.</review>

<Review>The wait was too long and the package deal can be better! The  price is moderate $$$.  Especially in a time like this where unemployment rates are up in this pandemic, it should have been less costly. However if you are going to charge so much, then give a bit more prints and poses per package.<//Review>< pictures>

Ordered the USB drive with my daughters pictures on September 16th. I got a e-mail October 1st that they were on their way. It is now October 22nd and no delivery. Contacted them and they don't know what happened. "Out of courtesy to me, they would be willing to make another for me and give me option to pick it up. I asked, why was this option not given to us in the website?
Answer, we are doing it out of courtesy to you to ensure you receive it.
First of all, it is not my job to ensure I receive what I paid for including shipping.
I don't know who has possession of my daughter's pictures!!!! That's what has me very upset.<//Text>

<text>Terrible company. For whatever reason my daughters school changed from Lifetouch to this company. The photographers do not know how to pose children. Always a basic hands to your side stance. Well this time they told my daughter to tilt her head down because her glasses created a glare. Seriously you’re a photography company who doesn’t know how to fix that?! Have her take her glasses off. Make shift her head to the left or right a bit. But no. Now we have some awkward looking photo because her head is tilted downward. You have to prepay for the photos so I’m stuck with these now. I’ll never purchase school pictures again as long as they’re coming from this company.< /text>< pics>

Im giving one star because we had a positive experience when getting my son's senior pictures taken but when I received the pictures I was shocked at the quality. I paid alot of money for these pictures and they were printed on floppy low quality Kodak paper. I suggest you buy 1 8x10 picture and go get copies made. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE PICTURES! You will be disappointed.<//Review>

Horrible quality pictures.  From their reviews this is nothing new.  I am not sure why the schools keep going with them.  I am sure whoever is on the PTO/PTA board gets kickbacks from them for signing with them.  Lifetouch is way better.  I emailed them about being unsatisfied with the quality of my pictures and no response.  It's been over 1 1/2 weeks.  I guess they do not care that they have bad reviews.  They should invest in better camera.<//Review>

Over priced for start and took them 5 weeks to get me my pictures with a simple necklace. Ordered December 20th and after multiple calls and follow ups they could not tell me where my package was. I had to make a trip to local post office to make sure they weren't holding it. As soon as i asked for a refund for my purchase of 100+$ they had it ready within a day January27th. Makes me wonder if they even shipped my pictures and dont care about customers orders.

One thing i will say was they weren't rude everytime i bugged them about my order. But definitely lack of communication within. Get it together!</Text>

They charge a sitting fee for over priced senior portraits that most aren’t able to afford but if you want your child to be in the yearbook for there senior year you have to pay for it. It’s not like they weren’t on campus to take pictures for picture day they used for the rest of the yearbook they could have very well used those pictures..no they leave so many seniors pictures missing..disappointing!! way to go...great job! Your gonna wind up like lifetouch...Replaced.< /Text>

<Text>First I ordered picture for my son from his school. I ordered locket it looks very cheap. And I didn’t liked the picture as well. So I called the them and mailed the picture and necklace back. They said they’re going to send me back a check after few days. Week later I called them to say I haven’t received the check . They said they already mailed it and it will be delivered. Week later again I called they said they issued another check because I haven’t received the check. Another week I waited then called them again they said it should be delivered in a few days. Waited and called them again. They said sorry and they will send a check thru fedex today . Hopefully it’s true this time . In short they’re liar 🤥. Shouldn’t be trusted .<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Mrs Mom< /Name><date>1449052753335</date><Rate>1</Rate><Review>NOT PROFESSIONAL QUALITY IMAGES. BELOW AVERAGE, and cell phones yield far better images. It is all about whether the photographer understands their settings. I never thought I would say that Lifetouch takes wonderful school pictures, until my daughter's school switched to Studio 1 last year.  The images are consistently bad quality, not even remotely professional.  Last year, besides having an unpleasantly bright face from what appears to be on-camera flash, the camera lens' focus was on my daughter's shirt, so her eyes were a bit blurry.  We had her retake, and the retake was not great, but better than blurred eyes.  This year, the flash on her face was even brighter, and when retakes were done, her face was even more unusually and unpleasantly brighter than the last image (and her hair wasn't looked into by the photographer).  Any company offering professional photography services should know that a  simple inexpensive diffuser is needed to make the flash emit more natural and appealing results, instead of an unusually bright face.  Or a proper lighting set-up would do the job.  Studio 1 apparently is just a business that takes pictures, but is not knowledgeable of the fundamentals of photography and lighting.  Very disappointed.  I was looking forward to her school pictures, but it's such a waste of money that I would rather take my own pictures of her.< /Review>< Pics>

The 1st time was to have the pictures taken. On this particular day, it was a mess back in the back where the pictures were being taken. Three wait time went way beyond what out should had & my daughter really didn't get a chance to do the whole photo session. There were only 2 photographers when we went in & a whole bunch of kids waiting to get their picture's taken. By the time it was my daughter's turn we had been passed the estimated time of wait they had given us & my daughter was ready to go! The 2nd time I went in to pick select my photos for purchase. I had arrived way beyond my appointment time & still wait ed for a long time before being taken to pick out the pictures I was going to pick & payoff our $440+ photo package. This is the company our children's school district hired to fulfill this task. I wish they'd offered options instead.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Update ::: Studio 1 made everything right :)

I did not receive what I ordered with my children's school picture package.
I was told I was going to receive 1 8x10 and 16 wallets of both my children, which is what I paid for.
When my children brought home their pictures all that was given to them was 16 wallets no 8 x 10.
I called their office and the lady stated that I did not order and 8 x 10 of just my child but an 8 x 10 of the class photo.
I stated to her so I paid all this $ for 16 wallets and a class photo . I told her next year I would just pass on picture orders and she stated to me they would still give each child an 8 x 10 class photo as a "gift" from studio 1.
I told her that doesn't make sense if all the children receive the class photo as a "gift" why did I have to pay for mine since apparently what she told me i paid for was an 8 x 10 and 16 wallets..
She said she would send both my kids 8 x 10 pictures to the school.
I will see if that happens. If it does I will update my review accordingly.</text>

Awesome experience, photographers were very polite and patient. I can't imagine the stress they must under go photographing 1000+ kids! Keep up the good work!<//text>

< review>
This company were so lazy to fix my sons bowtie before taking the picture, mind you, my son wore a big red bowtie. Shame on them! Such an obvious mistake they failed to fix. Not professional. Never will I buy from them. Prices are definitely overpriced. If you can't take the stress and pace of taking pictures of students for school, then don't! This will only post if I click on atleast 1 star, but they don't deserve any at all!</review>

I call they say they never took his photo, and then call me back to let me know they found his photo now and will be sending it which I have not even recieved it's been 2 1/2 weeks now. worst experience. I hope bella vista elementary choose a different company because this this ridiculous.< /Review>< pics>

When I finally got through to them they wanted to add an $8 fee since the time period had lapsed. I told receptionist I shouldn't have to pay that because they haven't returned my calls. She had the nerve to tell me "We always return the calls" Obviously not! They need a new receptionist with better customer service. If I could remember her name I would post it.<//Review>< Date>

Terrible school photography did not listen to child's wishes my child looks over makeup for an 8 year old the female made my daughter not smile to hide the gap in her teeth which gave her a double chin and made her look completely unlike herself my kid looks like she's wearing makeup highly dissatisfied and want my money back< /text>

<Review>(Changed my rating because I FINALLY got the picture on around 4/24/2019 but I wont order from them anymore. I dont want to go through the same BAD experience) original post>>BAD company..they shouldn't be giving service to schools. I have been waiting for my son's class picture since DECEMBER 2019 and been calling and calling to just get false info that they will send it to the teacher soon or to call in 2 weeks...keep calling and nothing..we are in APRIL 2019..still waiting after 2 messages I left in voice mail now hoping they call me back (DOUBT IT) I want my picture or money back and wish they get denied at schools.

<review>VERY LAZY looking work on helping a child polish up really quick and on the pictures, also. My kids attend San Jose Charter and I really wish the school would wisen up and find a studio that will actually take pride and practice what they preach in what they do. Don't bother wasting your time and money on this company.<//review>< pics>

Our school uses this place for some reason instead of Life touch, I've never had good quality pictures from them. This year was the worst. She is red in the pictures, the editing was horrible.. One of her arms is significantly smaller than the other and the position they had her sitting was really awkward and made her collar bones stick out and look like she hadn't eaten in weeks, my child isn't even skinny!!. Perfect picture for a "feed the starving children" advertisement. When I called I got a rude receptionist, no apology for a wasted $50.</text>

I pay every year for photos however this year was not up to my expectations my children my son was too dark and my daughter looked like she was completely caught off guard.. and her last name was spelled wrong I was going to call and complain however I see it will be waste of my time after reading these reviews . I just will save my money and take my business else where.

2 years in a row where my sons school pictures turned out horrible.  Again, they are blurry and his eyes are half shut.  Aweful.  I usually don’t write reviews but I’m so upset with the way these pictures turned out for the 2nd year in a row, I felt others should know.  There are so many other wonderful photographers for the same price.  Chaparral Elementary in Claremont, you can definitely find a better company especially for the price we pay!</text>

Studio 1 has been my Go To Photographer for our past 3 Proms. The packet prices were affordable, the staff was polite, prompt and professional and Greg Kelm was amazing in turning around the pictures so that our students would have them in time before leaving for the summer. Thank You Studio 1 for always meeting and exceeding my expectations! :)</Review>

<text>I received my one of my two sons' photo packages, had to call to ask for my other son's package.  The Receptionist took down his name and my home address and said the photos will be mailed and received by me within 5-7 business days.  I am giving them 3 stars because at least they say they are going to send me the photos.  I will wait and see how it goes.  To be honest, my other son's photos were a bit out of focus.  Not so sure I like the quality. Update: the company did a great job of replacing the missing photos, which sadly was not the company's fault, but the school's misplacement.  Now I have two sets.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My kids have their school pictures through this company and i absolutely hate them!!! For the money I spend on them they should be better quality and not blurry!!! One of my daughters pics they photoshopped off all her freckles without my permission!! I called and complained and they sent me the same pic!!!😡 My other daughters pic they photoshopped a Silver tooth where she has a missing tooth.

<Text>Waited for my daughters school pictures for a few weeks. I finally get them there was somebody else's kid with my daughters name. I called studio 1 and they said they lost her images. I tried to schedule a shoot they said they are booked solid for a few weeks. She graduates on June 2nd and she will have no pics with  her diploma . These are once in a lifetime memories and they seem to be bothered I keep calling to resolve this .</Text>< Pictures>

<text>First, they show up to my daughter's high school (Etiwanda), and don't give her a picture form to send home even though they took her picture. So we wait, and no pictures. So I call, and they claim the pictures have yet to be sent to the school. So I drive over to Rancho Cucamonga to their building. The first person says they can't do anything, and then the other person says they can because her picture was taken. I pay in person, get a receipt, and am told the pictures will arrive with all of the kids' pictures at her high school on September 20. No kids receive their pictures on September 20. So I call this morning to hear a recording for 5 minutes telling me I'm the first person in line, and after I finally get someone on the phone am told all of the kids got their pictures yesterday. They didn't. So she finally agrees to send "duplicates" asking if I have a receipt, which I kept. This time I request sending to my home, and after I ask her to recite the address, she gives me the wrong zip code. I ask for a tracking number, and she can't do that, unless I pay another $8? She tells me it will be another 7 to 10 days? To send it from Rancho Cucamonga to Fontana? She was rude also. This is the absolute worst photo place there is in the inland empire, and doesn't deserve to be in business. Inept, incompetent, rude. If my pictures do not arrive, I will have the charge reversed on my credit card, and go somewhere else for school pictures.<//text></record>

It's really unfortunate they use them for school pictures!  There not same quality as any other school pictures I've ever gotten. Very expensive only offer packages, instead of getting the sizes you actually want ! And just like some one else mentioned they were very rude. Escondido school district please get new company to take pictures!!!<//Text>

Horrible ! It has been almost 3 weeks and my pictures haven't arrived. Called and said they were backed up like if a customer cares about how they are not doing their job. Received no solution at all but to hope to get my pictures before this Saturday when I needed them for my daughters birthday party. My daughters school needs to change photo company. Hope they go back to Lifetouch<//review>

Do not be fooled, we can take the picture in the graduation and reveal it in that size and they are the same as a barbarity for me it is not fair

No me gusto x que  todo es muy caro  solo en la cabeza de ellos puede caber que cobran 45 dolares x cada foto  y de 5×7 no me gusto para nada es demaciado esa cantifad.

I have never eaten at any El Pollo Loco before. So for years I have been missing out on the amazing food. I ordered two of the 4 piece meals. Then substituted the meat for all chicken  breasts with a side of pinto beans and rice. Corn tortillas  of course. Then proceeded to eat with friends. It felt like a Pollo-giving dinner.</text>

<Review>My dog likes whatever food I like. So by default my dog is addicted to chicken. But no chicken bones.  The dog is "cat"atonic now. It's better than Popeyes, better than KFC. Secret recipe.</Review>< Pics>

The food is delicious and healthy and the portions a good.  Quality-wise, I would say Pollo Loco is far superior to most fast-food places.  And I have always been happy with the service at this specific location.  Keep it up Pollo!</Text>

Still operating under Covid 19 restrictions, you can order drive through or take out only with no dine in option yet available. Service was very cordial and effective. I was in and out in under 10 minutes.<//text>

<rate>4<//rate><text>El Pollo Loco is definitely worth the wait. The chicken was juicy and the fries were great.  I had the extra hot and it wasn't too spicy. My girl friend decided to try the reaper and couldn't handle it. I tried a small piece and man was it hot. It really lives up to its name. My taste buds were dead after trying it. The staff is very nice. They cleaned our table, checked on our food , and even brought us milk when we told them we had ordered the reaper flavor. It's very loud in there due to the high volume of people. Overall delicious food!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Text>I bought a original pollo bowl and keto taco. Omg, the keto taco is incredibly yummy. The bowl was good, however I didn't like the rice. I don't recall there being rice in it before but perhaps I said no rice previously. Tje taco made up for it. I just started going back to El P. recently after getting food poisoning a year ago. The Keto taco is my new favorite.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<text>The food here is always good and fresh.  My favorite is the original pollo bowl combo for just $5.   You just can't beat that.  They also mail out coupons and have coupons in their app.  It's definitely one of my favorite places to eat.  I highly recommend it.< /text>< pictures>

Ordered food for delivery, and after an hour or so we decided to call and see what was going on. Called for about 15 minutes on and off and the restaurant wouldn't answer phone . Had to cancel order after long wait without an update on our order at all.< /text>

I bought tostada for $8. The container is big, very nice, and big. But that's the only positive things that I can say. I can estimate that the tostada include one spoon of beens, one spoon of rice, chicken breast dry and hard to choo, lettuce and tomato in small amount. I don't think it's worth $8.<//Text>

Drive thru is terrible. Wouldn't split car order in 2 because it would mess up rush hour orders? Tostada had about 8 pieces of chicken. Won't be going back to this location.< /text>

<Text>I have eaten at El poile loco a couple times recently and it was delicious. They have a couple of
$5.99 boxes that I found to be two meals they have some kind of bee burrito in there and I'm not crazy about burritos but this is a not oversized perfect one very delicious filled with all kind of good stuff and two tacos and a drink a medium drink for that price. One of the boxes they have even has those cinnamon spirals in it so you get a little dessert. I don't know why I fell into eating there again that I've truly enjoyed the couple meals I've had there and brought home< /Text>< user_name>

< review>
I ordered catering for 16 people. I ordered about 1 hr and  45 mins before I needed it and they were able to accommodate it. The food was ready by the time I got there (I was late by 15 mins)  so that was a relief since I was running late.  I didn't know they deliver for just $5, so I think that is a great value for the service. Might use their delivery in the future.

The food I ordered was correct and complete.  They provided the napkins, utensils and plates... everything was there as I requested.  The food was still hot,  it didn't disappoint.
I was happy with the whole experience and purchase. Very fast and convenient.< /review>

We just asked for the tostadas and then the lady asks with a combo then we say yes then she asks what kind of drinks. We say it then she says we don’t have LETTUCE and AVOCADO...we’re like whaaaat? 😂 My mom literally just got a salad from there. I only give it two stars because the food is good.</Text>

The store was clean, the manager was very nice, all the people working were very polite and friendly, even tho it was after 9 pm and they close at 10 and I  stayed there to eat until after 10, it was my first time at this location, and will always go to this same location. While I was ordering I noticed they didn't have any corn cake on the menu and the cashier was very knowledgeable even about the year they stopped selling it ..  love it great job< /text>

I called the store but the line just continued to ring with no answer. Once he came after an hour I told the driver I would like to cancel my order and he told me just give me $10 and I'll give you the food. I gave it to him because I felt bad, but I told the store I wanted my order canceled. So if he pocketed my $10 I would like to report theft within your company, and I was very un satisfied with the quality of service given, thanks to my hour delivery I was late to work myself.

I am tired of their bad service. I ask for extra salsa every time and they give me like two small containers about an inch tall or so and barely fill them half way. I have ordered Mac n cheese several times, and the last two times, I have gotten corn pieces in my Mac n cheese(I do not order corn). This has happened TWO times in a row from my experience. I am not sure if they are sloppily opperating from the food trays and using the same serving spoon, but what ever it is that causes the problem has to be stopped. They have also gotten orders wrong on many occasions.

On a more happy note, the flavors are great if they are not blended with other things I did not order, I highly suggest the Pollo bowl, one of my favorites. I am not saying not to go to the El Pollo Loco, but it isn’t something I would choose if I had the option.< /text>

Its not a good place to eat,good service but bad food, (maybe the people who prepared the food they dont care about how the give the food to the customer's)
in 3 differents occasions my tostada salad was nasty
1th time lettuce old
2th time chicken hard and yesterday
3th time rice very,very hard (old)
Like i said good service but bad experience with the food....3 times its to much......<//review>

<Review>First time here. AFTER unloaded surprise that’ll be $209 to unload 8 pallets. Only in America do you pay to deliver freight. I recall a time when the fee was upfront and if it was too high you could unload it yourself. Lumper #scam<//Review><GmapID>0x80c32ba2ce94aae5:0x598249f74d96e6ec</GmapID>< date>

Place is quick and all the employees actually were decent human beings. Check in was quick and paperwork was brought out to me. Wouldn't mind delivering again. Would give more notes but place is really self explanatory.<//Review>

We're usually in and out within 2 1/2 hours. But last time it took 5hrs to get unloaded.  Arrived at 0830 and left at 1330. Hopefully it's just a fluke and not gonna stay that way.< /Review>

Place is very nice, great facilities, love the restaurant.
EXCEPT: making it past the sec. guard gate is a big mess, they really need to modetnize their check-in process, couls easily take 2hrs at times to make it past that gate while blocking traffic on the street, not nice Sysco.<//Text>

<Review>Just about everyone posting bad reviews on Sysco. However, I had a very good experience at this location.  Employees are extremely helpful and very courteous that even includes the Security guards.  Wait time was about 1 hour and I was out of there. I'll surely come back again, left a good impression on me.  Good job people...<//Review>< userid>

Food truck is there at 6 and leaves at 7. Decent place to unload. Prepare for a few hour wait.

I was out of there I less than an hour today. Very happy.< /Review>< Pics>

Their check in process is very confusing and strange seriously I don't need to walk to 3 different departments you need a better system.

The place as a whole was really nice and the people were very friendly. The cafe lounge has good food for a fair price which was a great thought to help drivers out. Three stars because of the rude gate guard that checked us in he acted like we were just bothering him by showing up. He didn't give any information about the place or where to go nothing just a door number. We had two additional stops so we resealed the trailer and on the way out the same guard threw a fit that he was supposed to look inside the trailer and he would have sealed it. NOT HIS JOB!!!! Our trailer our product our customers OUR JOB TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR CUSTOMERS!! This is the same thing we were hired to do with your product and you even checked the seal to make sure we did our job correctly as contracted. So one rude unhelpful person should be explained to how to hive out good complete instructions and not assume that others can read minds.<//Review>

This is for truckers.. getting into the place is fine and dandy but when you get there the night before, there is no where to park. I found a side road that other drivers park at but depending on the time you get there, good luck. They need to make it so you may come in and park the night before if you need to do so.</text>

We are getting ready to open a new cafe.  Judy DeLeon invited us in for a business review and tasting.  We were blown away with the top notch individualized service, and the exquisite food that Chef Steve put together specifically for us.  We are looking forward to a successful partnership for many years to come.<//review>

< Review>
I was in and out in a timely fashion. The dock was not a pain to back into. Depending on the time of day, there is a  food truck on site.

What made Sysco less than a five star experience was the supervisor on the receiving dock. I decided to lump my own freight off and he was less than helpful on top of having a thick accent that was difficult to understand.< /Review>

<review>This is one of the slowest places ever! Expect to sit in the dock for up to 8 hours depending on what you are delivering. What takes so long is the checker, not the unloader. Warehouses have no respect for truck drivers. All they have to do is unload then sign your bills "subject to count" then let the driver go. If they have a problem with the load they can contact the shipper. They have no common sense!</review>< name>

If you have no choice but to deliver there and need a place to park, there is an autozone on Gale street in city of industry, it’s about 5 miles away but there is parking in the back and you can make your delivery after some rest. There won’t be traffic going east bound 60 in the morning. Good luck</Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80c32ba2ce94aae5:0x598249f74d96e6ec< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Truck drivers need to understand that Sysco provides food to the food service industry. It's like the reverse of a cross dock consolidation shipper. I brought them 18 pallets of chicken and they broke it down to 61 pallets, most likely a pallet per customer. That takes time... Something we truckers don't like.  All I can say is don't take a Sysco load expecting anything different. They went to work shortly after my appointment time so I shouldn't complain but it still sucks. Also, Brea Canyon Rd is off limits to trucks. You need to come in from Grand or Fairway to Valley to Lemon to Currier.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I agree with the post I read about the service at the receiving office. It is always a longer than usual wait to be unloaded at this place and the attitudes you get from the lumper and some receivers are appalling. I pay two and a half hundred dollars for six pallets to be unloaded and broken down and this easily exceeds 4 hours every time I'm here I will not bring any more loads here that's for sure</Review></record></dataset><record>

1 star only because there isn't a set of negative stars to choose from.

I'm a driver, each time I deliver here, I make sure I'm early to my appointment and still wait more than 4 hours before I can leave.

The receivers and management should come up with a more efficient way of doing business.

This is one of the worse stops I have to make.< /text>

They Open the gate before 6am
Trucks park on the private road leading to the gate but not inside the gate overnight
Quick unload but a long wait for paper work
But still reasonable
Very high lumpers fee though< /text>

<review>Google should have an option to give negative stars. Avoid this place at ALL cost.  Awfully slow and unprofessional.   Appointment time was set for 11am and didn't into  to a door until 2pm.   Only had four pallets.  I finished at 6pm with no explanation as to why it took soo long.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I've loaded and unloaded trucks for 10yrs prior to becoming a driver, so I know anything past 1 1/2 hours is just ridiculous...what is the purpose of paying a lumper if they're gonna take their sweet time, arrived at 0500, it is now 0930 and ticking.....<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Yet another place with ZERO respect for truck drivers and their HOS. It took nearly a FULL HOUR just to get through the gate/guardshack after pulling into their driveway. Their spectacular solution to my quandry about being late, despite showing up almost an hour early "just in case," was to "make sure and show up TWO HOURS early. Sure, with tight scheduling, and the fact that we don't make a penny when sitting. The check in system is archaic and complicated, the lumpers charge obscene prices, and the unloading process itself took another THREE HOURS. To summarize, one day of my week wasted making zero dollars, because places like this seem to stay in business and find companies that will deal with this level of disprespect. Zero stars if I could.<//review>< Pics>

Before you come here, you need to be prepared, and you have to pay to unload, and it's a long time to unload, which is the worst place I've ever seen in the United States.
It's mainly about queue-jumping.< /text>

Terrible!!!!!! Came at 3:30 am, they told me that they will open the gate at 4:00.... So they opened gate at 4:20 but Check in to unloading from 6:00am, there no parking place, so they gave me door at 6:30 am and now is 3:00pm they still unloading.  In the receiving office guy told me that usually unload takes up to 7 hours....  Waisting my time and money<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><userid>106956809917208459929< /userid><review>I’ve been coming here for the last few months. Every time, it’s been such a wonderful experience.

- The manicurists here are perfectionists. They have never cut my cuticle or made me bleed (which most nail places have to me, unfortunately.)

- They do nails so perfectly!!! See picture.

- The salon doesn’t staaank of nail polish and remover like most salons. Yes, the smell is there but it’s pretty minimal.

- They’re really nice and always take me on time when I walk in for an appointment.</review>< time>

They really adhere to covid guidelines, so you feel very safe. Plus they do an EXCELLENT job. Taking time to really pay attention to details. Definitely worth the money and time, plus they are super considerate! 100% would go back< /Review>

Great service! This was the best pedicure I’ve ever had. I used the luxury spa. They spent a lot of time on my feet and massaged most of the time which I liked. Thank you!<//Text>

I highly recommend Nail Care and Spa. I have been their customer for years and can vouch for the quality of services they provide. They follow the CDC guidelines in regards to keeping the salon clean and sanitized. Excellent service at reasonable price with professional and friendly staff. Christine is very efficient with scheduling, and Sophia always does a great job with my nails and facial. You really won’t go wrong with any of the staff. All of them are excellent! Soft music and massage is super relaxing!  This nail salon is my one and only— THE best!!!<//Review>

This one is great and I am picky. Very clean and follows all COVID rules... they even take your temperature when you walk in. Social distanced between customers.
Everyone is very friendly and I just got a really nice pedicure from Sophia.
So happy I found this nail salon!! Highly recommend!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I've been going to this place for a few years... they have friendly and skilled employees here (downtown) for manicure/pedicure/massage. We always get the Ultimate which is well worth the money ...if you have leg/arm muscle kinks (that you maybe didn't even know you had) ask for AMY ...she will hit you up! ...pressure points, toxin release she knows wth she's doing!< /Text>< pics>

Super clean! Paid extra close attention to annoying calluses I get on my toes (being an athlete) lots of other places do not remove them as part of the callus removal so I was super pleased! No cross contamination either. Friendly & on time! Also, GREAT MASSAGE !

Regular spa pedicure $27
Callus removal $7
Removal of only TWO gel nails $0<//Review>

So happy ☺️ Personal fans helped keep me cool and comfortable while having my nails done (I get hot when I wear a mask). The classical piano songs playing added a really nice touch. I got the ultimate spa pedicure and a regular gel manicure and Amy was wonderful. She took her time and it felt so nice to be pampered. I’ll definitely be back.<//text>

Had such a great overall experience at Nail care & Spa! One of the best pedicures I’ve ever received hands down. They were so kind and the calf/foot massage was so relaxing. They have a good polish selection and great prices. Will be coming back often!! Thank you Nail care & Spa!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</Review>

<Review>Currently visiting San Diego and this place was so great! I had to take a covid quiz, quick temperature check and was given hand sanitizer before & after my service! My pedicure came out perfectly and my foot massage that was included in my basic pedicure wasn’t a quick 30 second massage which was super nice and appreciated. Thanks so much, def check out!<//Review>< user_name>

Great experience. Was in town for work and only had limited time on Sat. They were able to get a Mani and Pedi done in just over 1 hr.
Only complaint is that while the door was open at 9am, it took them 10-15 minutes to find the right person to do my nails. Made me a little nervous, but it was worth the wait!<//text>

<text>They are the best! Friendly and professional!  They do my nails, toes and waxing.  Kimberly does my nails and wax, Amy does my pedicures. Very clean. I'm thinking about trying out one of their facials.</text>< pics>

<Review>Dope place!
I kinda get a specific type of nail and looked at 5 other places.. Annie took her time and made sure and confermed everything was exactly what I wanted.. my broken phone doesn't do the job justice... everything was nice clean, up to date . . Annie even had a new type of quiet dermal.. and the place is every aired out.. not a air freshener that just mixes acrylic smell and the fragrance... I mean I didn't even smell nail salon..

Great place...very nice ladies. When my pedicure didn’t turn out quite right they did it over right away. I’d definitely go back but I’m on vacation and I’m from out of town. Very clean place.<//review>

<Text>Ran across this little gem on a very random street corner while traveling to San Diego. They were very sweet and welcoming. My gel manicure has lasted longer than any other I've ever had. Going on 12 days and not a chip! Great quality and tons of color choices.< /Text>< pics>

Annie saved my messed up and falling off acrylics from the last place I visited. She's very sweet and understanding of what I want. I've been paying the same price for fills at a lot of other places that don't even measure up to how pleasant my experience was here<//review>

<Text>Very genuine, polite and professional staff. My manicure was one of the best that I’ve ever received. Not only was it thoroughly performed in a timely manner, it was accompanied with a relaxing hand/forearm massage and warm towel to top it off.

UPDATE 3/30/2021: My last review below was right before new management took over in 2019, but since then, service has been Excellent!! Amy, Christina & the rest of the staff are great at what they do and I've been a happy & steady customer for over a year now!!

-Everyone was very polite, but the Polish started to peel the first day and I noticed, once I was outside in natural light, that there were brush marks from when she used the paintbrush to clean the edges if my nails of extra polish. It was ok but I won't be going back; that was not a $65 mani/pedí that was worth the money.<//review>

<review>I was the first customer of the day which was a little awkward to me at first, but then I got the best treatment with a mani and pedi at the same time. I got to relax in the message chair the whole time while getting messaged on my legs and arms at the same time. Then, after, they didn't kick me out and let me sit there till my nails dried.<//review>< name>

<text>I have been using their service for 2 years now. Right now I am looking for another place near my house. but always come back here after a fail try. Advantages of this place are 1. Clean (they just bought all new furniture) 2 A lot of choices of nail polishes and shellac gels 3 Walkins are always welcome
I would give them 4.5 just because they can be in a rush trying to serve all walkins</text>< Pictures>

Poor nail color selection. Clunky colors old. Upcharge for non-gel good color polish. Ridiculous. Over priced pedicure. there are cleaner salons that do better for much less.< /text>

<review>So I'm fairly new to SAN Diego I googled a nail salon they were first on the list I tried them out and loved them !!! Around my 4th time going I experienced a situation where I didn't like the nail color half way thru and asked to changes mind u I had already paid and then I decided to just get a clear gel coat and she charged me $2 extra but I had already paid for a gel color in the 1st place...but I decided to give them another chance today !(oct 13, 2016) && the lady was rude she acted as if I was a bother and she didn't want to help she had An attitude as well. I told my friend to meet me there she walked in & NO ONE asked her what she needed so I asked the lady doing mine how long all she wanted was a cut down &I the lady said idk and never asked anyone else to assist her. BAD BUSINESS & they will NOT GET ANYMORE MONEY FROM ME !<//review>< pictures>

Over priced.
I initially choose the basic pedicure service but since I did have some calusus I decided to upgrade the package.
I basically paid extra to receive a rub.</text>

Thank god I went through ALL the reviews/comments before even heading out of my way to check this place out. This place has more negative than positive. You honestly have to take your time to read every single review. I notice that the positive reviews are from fake accounts. Dealt with shady dealerships before in the past, and I’m not planning on dealing with them ever again. Good luck people</Text>

The whole team was very professional, and made me feel comfortable.
They were willing to work with me and my situation, and in the end they give me a better car and at my budget too!!
Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to buy a car from here.< /Review>

<Text>Despite some of the reviews. I was very happy with my experience here. Juan & Ash were a great help, one hour later I'm driving a 2012 Altima.

I'm sure people that left bad reviews, just had a bad day and decided to take out on these guys.  P.S

HUGE Variety of cars to choose from!<//Text>< Rating>

<Text>Rare that I leave low ratings but occassionally it happens. Was looking to buy a Honda listed online so I called and spoke to Abby who didn't inform me she was only a marketing person. I was driving from San Diego and Abbey assured me I would be able to test drive and purchase the vehicle. Called Abby an hour before she said the car was still there. I got to the dealership and to no avail the car was no longer on the lot and was sold. Which I could have been informed of but Abbey decided it wasn't important to relay that information to me. Poor work on more than one end. Avoid calling or for anything you hear over the phone to be accurate. Sorry< /Text>< time>

<text>Remember those used car dealers who would not hesitate to flatter,  shame or bully you into buying something different than what was advertised,  rush you through the legal work and leave you pondering how much time and effort you were willing to go through to set things right? If you don't, try out this place. If you don't want the trauma,  please stay far away!!< /text>< resp>

<review>STAY AWAY!!! This place is your typical bait and switch used car lot.  I called them prior to going to the lot and they told me the car was available. The rep on the phone that helped me was Maria.  I had her confirm the VIN and stock number of the car to ensure we are talking about the same car and she assured me it was available still.  About an hour after that I went to the lot and they said they sold the car on the previous day.  I told them I spoke to them on the phone an hour ago and they told me it was here.  The sales rep begin by saying the customer service rep might've made a mistake.  I told them, no I confirmed the VIN and stock number.  After that I went home and called again and they again confirmed that the car was available (confirmed VIN & stock number).  They will lie to you to get you to get on the lot.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Name>

Wife and I went here to look at a truck. Once we did a walk around wide was ready to go, rough exterior. Once I saw the age and two different sets of tires from front to back I was ready to go. When I told the sales guy Ash you know thats bad, it will ruin the transfer case or something costly, he just srugged his shoulders. We could not get out of this place fast enough.<//review>

Will you do right by the people that you have ripped off. Acts 7:50-51 do right by the people that you make money off of. The only way to service right is to be honest not  thieves.< /text>

<time>1555692453381< /time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>I think it’s interesting that a car can have a price drop the night before, and be sold the morning right when they open. I was hesitant to come here because of the bad reviews on Cargurus, but I decided to give them a chance when True Car allowed a $200 discount. I got the True Car discount for both Sonatas they had in stock at 8am, got there at 9am when they opened, and they told me they had no Sonatas there.

I mean at least take down your inventory on all car websites, and including your own. I drove 45 mins to get here.....< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>We drove an hour to attempt to purchase a vehicle and once we got there they said it was sold.  Frustrating to know that even their customer service verified the appointment prior it was still sold.  If we knew this was going to happen we would've never driven that far.  Once arrived, there was no sympathy to the updated news.   Worst customer service ever.  They lost our business on arrival, and this should say alot about who they are.  I called the person who confirmed and questioned why they said it was available and it wasn't. They said that's what it shows in their system.  There is a total miscommunication between their scheduling department and what is clearly on the lot.  Dont waste your time here  .</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I talked with Pernando about my interested PASSAT this morning and this car looks available on their website and cargurs too, but when I arrived at the Safeway auto center by long driving time, other staff said Pernando is working for call center at other city and the car was sold out yesterday. Also I asked Hyundai Sonata which I interested in the website, other staff said the car also just sold out yesterday. I can't believe all this car sellers who is working at Safeway auto center. They just wanted someone comes even not available cars which customer wants to see it. So bad marketing<//Review>< pics>

First off, I wish there was an option to put 0 stars. By all means, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! I bought a car from this dealership and it was the biggest mistake I've ever made. They basically sold me a lemon and are NOT cooperating in any way.  I tried to  settle this with them, but they keep ignoring me. Going to go through the DMV to get this place shut down. They should NOT be able to sell cars.< /review>

I came in for a car advertised at 11450 online. I called 3 times in advanced to double check the price. I drive an hour to get there and asked the man not to run my credit because i have a loan through my bank. He insited he needed my information and went to another room and ran my credit! Then came back and told me the car was 17000.<//Text>

Received a call from a person that supposedly worked there that told us that the vehicle was at their location. Drove 60 miles arrived to find out vehicle had been sold the day prior. Why say they have a vehicle when they dont?! He said they have this happen on a daily basis "customer are upset all the time" advised I would post this review, his reply "we already have bad reviews" THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ITS BEST FOR YOU! lol<//review>< Response>

Do not, I repeat Do not! go to the dealership. They are scammers. I put 2500 down for a  Vehicle, they took the car back and did not return my down payment back to me. They do not follow up or follow thru anything. They lie,  I had to drive too and from many times to resign my contract, they kept changing it, Then asking for a copy of my social security card. Scam SCAM STAY AWAY!!!!< /Review>

They still had the car in my name, using it. Now the ticket is $241. Had to put a star so i can post this review....< /review></record>

They tell you one thing and don't really make the effort to do what they say!! My friend bought a car and has nothing but problems with it and they will not fix the title issue and they will not budge on putting her in something that doesn't have issues!! Joke is these pop up auto places take and take and take and no I'm not having a bad day and taking it out on them!! This is real and they are crooks here!!< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) My experience was horrible because they really are a band of thieves who have no scruples or reason to be human.
His only means is to steal from the entire Latino or person who is going to buy a car. In the same way they sell cars that are a disaster because mechanically they are useless, you take it to a mechanic and he says how many defects it has, apart from doing fraudulent paperwork and not returning money, they say they charge things that they should not and even more when they still do not put the documentation . They are a gang of people who all they want is to scam others. Maybe at least they think they will get to do an investigation and there is if they must show what type of dealer they are. Really absolute disappointment and believe me that regarding a reliable business it is not, if I could talk more about them but really what I want it to be, the investigator who will not be able to do fraud arrives soon ...

Mi experiencia fue horrible porque realmente son una banda de ladrones que no tienen escrúpulos  ni razon de ser humano.
Su unico medio es robar a todo el latino o persona que vaya a comprar carro. De igual manera venden carros que son un desastre porque mecánicamente no sirven para nada, lo llevas a un mecánico y dice cuantos defectos tiene.aparte hacen papeleo fraudulento y no devuelven dinero,  dicen cobrar cosas que no deben y mas cuando aun no meten la documentación.son una pandilla de personas que lo unico que quieren es estafar a los demas. Quizas cuando menos piensen les llegaran a hacer una investigación y hay si deben de demostrar que tipo de dealer son. Realmente decepción absoluta y créanme que encuanto a negocio fiable no es.si pudiera hablar mas de ellos pero realmente lo que deseo que es llegue pronto el investigador que pir ente a el no le podran hacer fraude....

The employee was so rude. She told my grandparents that the phone would be ready for pick up in the next two days. She was on the phone with me asking what iPhone we ordered when I told her I had no idea my grandma paid for it. My mom went in the store asked her if the iPhone was ready. The lady looked up the phone and was rude and said multiple times that it wasn’t paid for. My mom said she would pay for it once it got to the store, but lady was adamant about payment. I will not return to this store. My grandparents will not want too either.< /review>

Horrible!  He will tell you anything to get your money but it's all talk!  For a new business in a competitive market, he should stand behind the guarantee.  Don't waste your money!  Run to any other carriers.   He needs a lesson on customer service.   He wanted 100. For insurance claim.  I called the corporate office and to file a claim was 20.  HE TRIED TO RIP ME OFF.  If i had to call the corporate office to resolve this, guess what he will do to someone who doesn't call the corporate office.  Hold on tight to your $$$</text>

< review>
Discovered Cricket Wireless a few months ago and I love it! Great coverage, service, and reasonable prices. I have had many phone carriers, Metro, Boost, Virgin Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, Tmobile, and Verizon. By far Cricket has exceeded them all.  Sultan at the Vacaville store, is knowledgeable, friendly, courteous, honest, and very helpful, I cannot say enough about the good service I have received from him. I made many visits, before deciding to switch to Cricket. I high recommend a visit to Cricket, and see for yourself!<//review>

Wonderful location in Arden on Howe Ave. allows you easy access to the interstate or downtown even. The Arden Mall, with its host of eateries literally are just minutes away. The grounds are normally well kept.</Text>

Sewer backup last year took weeks to be addressed - wheelchair tenant had to repeatedly wheel through sewer waste which created an unsanitary condition in the apartment. Mom had to threaten to call health department before the situation was corrected.<//Text>

<Text>The inside of the apartment is cheap! In the sense of everything that’s in the apartment can rip off easily! The closet doors don’t work properly, I keep complaining about the Fan by the kitchen but they don’t do a great job! It works a little but after that it don’t work no more!!! Yet we paying rent but everything inside the apartment is fake! There’s no water today and they didn’t notify us that there’s no water! Every doors in the apartment is no good! Especially the knobs can rip off easily! This place is a disaster !!!<//Text>< rating>

Management and staff were nice, but the complex was old (made it difficult to get internet hooked up) and had cockroaches (not for their lack of trying to get rid of them). Not the worst place ever, and it's close to a lot of stuff (restaurants, mall, freeway). Overpriced like every other hood apartment in Sac, though you could do much worse.< /review>< pics>

< Review>
These apartments are by far the worst Apartments in Sacramento County, do not move into these apartments find another apartment. There is all kinds of gang activity, loud people screaming and their music bumping all throughout the night you have a bunch of homeless people going through the trash at all times of the day and expecially in the night and worst of all there is zero parking you have one parking space that you pay for and then you have to fight for a separate parking space with a bunch of other people you will never have parking ever, so hopefully you only have one car there are roaches and rats and pigeons on the roof that make all kinds of noise. The rent is 850 a month for a one-bedroom with a $550 down payment plus first month's rent not even close two worthless piece of crap apartment the area is shity area although there's plenty of shopping and stores and restaurants the mall.</Review>

<Review>The most bad experience I had with this apartment. Apartment's manager Terry gave me an appointment for 10.30 am in the morning to book for the apartment of 2 bedroom, but while on my way from Berkeley to sacramento when I call them they told me that apartment was already rent out and that manager gave me the wrong information or I misheard something! I will never advise anyone to rent with them! Because they blame   everything on me in an unprofessional way! If anyone has also the bad experience with them please share it, so apartment can get a new management</Review><response>None< /response>< userid>

<Review>It is a nice little farmers market but does not have any local households selling stuff which I like to see. I just enjoy that kind of thing. Some tents have much better produce than the local grocery stores at slightly better prices. it's well worth going.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Only one question: why did not we start coming here long time ago?  Feels so great to buy fresh, local, tasty and very often save money.  Very nice atmosphere, no problem with parking.  Just try the bring cash.< /text>

What a great farmer's market! I felt super safe and comfortable and I love the variety of produce and some of the best tamales I've ever had in my life are there! There's also a really great pita bread place and they make homemade chips! Check it out if you get a chance! Every Sunday till noon!</text>

<Text>This is my favorite farmers market; over the years the number of vendors increased; product variety improved. You can find anything from eggs to flowers, cheese, drinks, ready made food, of course fresh vegetables and fruits. The farmers market provides opportunity to live the seasons via fruits and vegetable each season brings. The vendors are always happy and helpful; the samples are fun.< /Text>< Pictures>

Really gave me an Ellis Island vibe inside with a sand colored polished brick on the walls and darker vintage lights on the ceiling. There were so many shops but the coolest part was being able to walk outside and up onto the bridge like dock and look at the golden gate or even back at the Port of San Francisco signage.

Really cool place - didn't end up buying or eating anything but it was worth following through on the recommendation to see it!<//review>

The Laguna Niguel Farmers Market has a very good blend of farm grown produce and fruit as well as healthy alternative products. You can buy fresh bread there, grass-fed beef and even fish. But the best part of the market is the avocado oil vendor, AVO-CO... they sell California grown avocado oil and flavored balsamic vinegars. They alone make this Market worth visiting!</Text>

Great little market.

Plenty of parking and it's not too busy, so you can usually get what you need easily.

There is an awesome selection of vendors too:

Coffee, fruits, vegetables, nuts, yogurts, breads, juices, essential oils, pastries, tamales, soups, seasonings, flowers, succulents, eggs, kombucha, everything!

Starts at 8 am and shuts down at noon, so it is a great way to kick off your Sunday.</Text>

When I go to Costco I skip buying veggies & buy them here instead. My fave tent is the 3 for $5 organic bunches. Mix and match bunches of kale, arugula, chard, dandelion, and a variety of other greens!</Review>

I'm over 70 years old and I get it,  but life is life, so take it with stride, take a deep breath, lookup n thank ur Heavenly Father JEHOVAH that ur still alive, to be able to have all the emotions u have, then read Rev 21:3,4. Have a good day, I certainly will. My bank closed, so had to drive here from Perris 😷❤️👍😎</review>

I usually don't rate places or get up tight about little things. Especially customer service reps. I understand it's a low-paying tough job but, man. The level of unprofessionalism and short-sighted planning in this branch in unbelievable.

I waited an hour for a temporary card to be told they were unable to print my card. When I questioned why I was told they were too busy to perform that service.

There were no signs or any type of warnings and I also got to this location 2 hours before closing.

I still don't understand the concept of them being too busy to help a customer who waited because they needed to help customers who arrived later.<//Text>

This is the one of the worst BofA's In Riverside County and the Branch Manager has no clue in Customer Service to handle basic traffic.

I’d highly recommend anyone not coming here unless you really have too especially on a Fri or Month End, there's always 25-30 people in line with 1 Teller and they are sarcastic, rude, and arrogant to deal with and don't care how long your waiting and it’s usually 45 min standing in line to make a Deposit.

Calling the Corporate Line to complain is useless and does nothing to serve to purpose.

This branch is awful they just don't know how to work the system to make it easier for customers to handle their business. S< /review>

Got there around 415 pm 1 teller and one person in a suit with approximately 12+ people in line, then the suit person gave their customer to the one and only teller to compete her transaction which took more than 20 minutes.  Then the manager speaks about the wait and she pulled another teller to help out., so know just 2 tellers.  Then  tellers comes out to count money then leaves,  also 2 additional persons in suits in those offices looking busy.  This was the WORST day doing business in this branch. Possibly during those high business times need more tellers.   Transactions was finally completed at 5:00 pm, 45 minutes is far to long just to make a deposit into a business account.<//review>

Just wanted to say Sam is the man, went in just needing a temporary replacement card. I ended up walking out with financial advice, not only for me, but my family as well. Thank you for keeping it all in a timely manner while at the same educating me about finincial services i might need down the line.<//Review>

"0" Zero stars.  Agree with all reviews about lack of tellers.
$4.9 billion was B of A profit for consumer banking in 2017.
Went in last Thursday @ 12:30, 15 people in line, 1 teller.  Left.
Suit says "they're at lunch and will be back later"
Went in 2:00, 23 people in line, 1 teller.  Left.
Went in Friday, 10:00, 14 people in line, 1 teller.  3 people doing
nothing but to say hi how are ya.
Don't know why they always have an armed security guard
at the lobby doors, cause even the customers can't get
their money out.  Bowelshoot service from a trillion dollar

<Review>Worst bank of America when it comes to customer service. What is the point of having on average 9 people in the building and having 1 maybe 2 tellers actually working. The line on average has 20 people in it with 7 teller windows and no tellers. Even the lady who stands at the desk doesn't do anything.  I literally just saw someone walk in and stand a desk for 4 minutes and wait while the lady stood at the other desk doing nothing. Laziness pure laziness. If I didnt live across the street from this place then I would gladly drive across town. I come her once a month to pull out rent because the ATMs will only give out 20's but other branches give out 50's or 100 dollar Bill's. Such a high profile area with the worst workers and set up.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I absolutely hate coming to this BofA! They never seem to have tellers knowing that this is a busy location. Average wait time is typically 30 mins plus. However, todays wait was 50 mins which is ridiculous!!!!!</Review>

Every time I go there the line has about 8 people and 1 teller you ask them to get another teller they say all they have right know. They don't care about getting you served in a timely manner.they should have at least 3 tellers.if I didn't have to pay my rent here I would never go.</review>

I stated that I was unhappy of their service and they only came up with an excuse to having a busy agenda.  I guess customers should have all the time of the world.<//Text>< pics>

He came home and explained to me what happened ...  very unprofessional ...  treat everyone with respect young & old. No matter what the situation...  I wish I wouldn't have to give one star.  I have been a customer of Bank of America all my life & have never felt like this ...<//review>< pictures>

Today my visit to the ATM was disheartening to say the least.The side walk was filthy, multiple gum spots, wasted baked in liquid stains on the side walk, paper and lids from soda all over the place. Over a 5 year period of banking at this location that is the absolute worse I've ever see it. It reminded me of an inner city strip mall or someplace where nobody cares. My home or yard does not look like this so tell me why I should pay to do business with a place that looks like this? Has management changed? If so it needs to change again. Is it possible to clean the place up? I hope so.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

HOW FAIR IS THAT?! At that point i said "forget it! i was first in the qeue, he was behind me, how come you are serving him first?" is this because they both came from the same race? or because their skin is lighter than mine? we deserved to be served in a manner that no matter how small or big your clients needs are, you should always serve the first in line first! you owe it to us who waited in the qeue. (i have nothing against Mexicans- i just used the word to describe the lady at the Disable's window as she really looks like one)

i really hope someone from the bank reads this.< /Review>< user>

Its a very complicated organization but few are willing to be that change for a better tomorrow. Some of there service workers are of age "metaphorically" speaking and are always on a hustle of some sort. Felt they discriminated agaisnt me , even when they would visit on a house matientce or when ask to do so. I dont understand if they are on a payroll , they should be ask to do so without an physical emotion that cause disturbance to the peace of ones mind. A few of there sites are beautiful but the spirits that lingers are deadly for those who are in discovery of serenity. These "principalities " are in a false state of qoute on quote " they own these homes." They bully and maniuplate those that are weak and powerless.< /review>

I recommend anyone who needs help and assistance, with housing, shelter, employment, food, clothing, to WLCAC. They helped my family and I in a major way, 8yrs ago, by blessing us with shelter/housing assistance. Thank You WLCAC and Cliff our Case worker!< /text>

< review>
The office is not easily seen from Gonzales Street.  You need to drive into the strip mall's parking lot in order to find the office.  Once you find it, across from Wells Fargo Bank, you can see the sign, Oxnard Dentistry, posted high up.  The interior is clean and modern, and the front office staff is very pleasant.  A real joy, compared to some other offices I have visited.  I had to wait much longer past my scheduled appointment time to receive my teeth cleaning, but it could be explained by the fact it was my first visit.  I met Dr. Keihani, who is quite pleasant and gentle.  A real pleasure.  His assistant then cleaned my teeth.  She explained the procedures she used so that I can gain a better understanding of what she was doing.  Dr. Keihani and the assistant recommended additional products and services, but there was no pressure placed on me to purchase them.  Overall, I am rating this service with five stars.  I plan to return in the future.<//review>

My husband and I have been going there for over a year thinking this Dentist was taking care of our teeth we moved to Utah and found out they were not!
My husband paid for a Lazer cleaning 800 Dollars was told he will only need regular cleaning for now on
He just had a check up and needs a deep cleaning with 6 and 7 pockets I feel we were taking financially and still paying care credit 😡< /text>

The dentists, dental assistants and receptionists are all so friendly and warm, I would definitely recommend this dentistry to anyone who needs work done but has been putting it off.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I arrived  at their office (Oxnard) today as a emergency visit. I was in a lot of pain from a tooth that had a bridge. The ladies  at the front desk were so awesome. They reassured me that I was in great hands. Dr. Cohen is so blessed!!! He numbed the area so well that I didn’t feel any pain during the root canal. The ambience in this establishment was nothing  but positive vibes!!! They have gained a new loyal client! I will be bringing my children and I will spread the word to my military friends and co workers! Thanks a million,  you all are blessed and awesome!! I absolutely can not thank you enough!❤️😘💓✨< /review>

Most amazing Doctor hands down. I can't believe the amount of time and thoroughness Dr Cohen had with me. Super easy to get an appt, and the girls in the front really worked with my schedule. I highly recommend Oxnard Dentistry and will be telling all of my co-workers. Thank you again!< /Review>

I called 5 different dentists and they all were closed but Oxnard Dentistry.  To my relief the receptionist that answered the phone was very polite, understanding and sympathetic, she had me come in immediately.
Dr. Cohen and his team made me feel comfortable and cared for. My extraction was pleasant and pretty pain free! I have since been back and have had several fillings and a partial denture done.
I was in customer service for 25 years and can really appreciate the efficiency and professionalism of this facility. I would highly recommend them to friends and family, pain free dental care does exist.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Oxnard Dentistry is hands down the best place I've gone to. I just had a bad experience at another place, so I was nervous to come here as well, but when I got there the ladies at the front desk were all so nice and friendly. Dr Cohen was great. Fast and to the point in getting me treated right away. I had to get a temporary crown as well as a root canal. One my second visit Dr Cohen was great in making sure I was comfortable the entire time of the procedures as well as his dental assistant. Overall great experience. I will continue to come here!<//review>

<Review>So far so good! I called on a Friday and was able to get seen the following Wednesday.I’m already scheduled  for treatment tomorrow . I was greeted today by a very down to earth and not stuffy receptionist. I hate going to office where they are sterile and give off a fake vibe . Doctor “k” (can’t remember spelling) treated me like a person and not a patient. He was relaxed and listened to my every concern . Most doctors just want to get in and out and onto the next patient . Many also just listen, smile and pretend like they heard you but really theyre only looking at your teeth X-rays 😆 I was happy with the office. It wasn’t too sterile or out dated. I’ll update tomorrow with how the procedure goes if I remember , but for now I’m happy and finally think I found a home dentist ❤️🙌🏼<//Review>< Name>

I have the worst anxiety when it comes to getting any kind of dental work done & I have so many problems with my teeth but Dr. Cohen is always so honest and caring. He really takes the time to talk to you & explain what steps should be taken next. The office is always clean and the receptionists are always kind. I would definitely recommend seeing them if you need any dental work done.</text>

Sedation Dentistry
What is sedation dentistry?
Sedation dentistry refers to a relaxation technique that alleviates stress in patients who experience significant anxiety during dental procedures.

In most cases, sedation dentistry offers anesthetic to help you get through a procedure. However, sedation dentistry doesn’t involve general anesthesia. Still, Dr. Keihani and his team offer multiple levels of sedation to make you as comfortable as possible.

The team’s compassionate approach to sedation dentistry is focused on making sure you never avoid dental procedures because of dental anxiety.

What are the different levels of sedation dentistry?
There are various levels of sedation dentistry. The three primary ones include:

Nitrous oxide inhalation sedation (laughing gas)
As the most common type of sedation, nitrous oxide inhalation sedation refers to a procedure during which Dr. Keihani places a mask over your nose. You breathe in nitrous oxide throughout the procedure, allowing you to relax. It’s most recommended for children and young adults, as the effects of nitrous oxide subside within hours of your dental procedure, allowing you to resume your daily activities.

This is wrong  you do not offer this, My wife asked for this that's on their website ,clearly misleading the assistant that took my wife's x rays says no longer offering it over a year now HMMM  False information on your website you need to clean it up.
I would not recommend this office.< /Text>

I live in Ventura and this office is this is the best dentist office I have been to! They are so courteous and professional. I did not feel rushed through, there were lots of staff available to answer my questions, and they were all very kind. Dr. Cohen created a treatment plan to address my dental issue. I have been looking for a new dentist for a while and am sooo happy I found Oxnard Dentistry.< /review>

< Review>
I've never felt so comfortable and calm at a Dentist as I do here. Dr Mayhor Cohen has been incredibly kind and patient; he has taken such great care of me through my first dental emergency, my first root canal as well as routine cleaning/care. He explains what he is doing/why, he really takes his time and I never feel rushed or like I'm inconveniencing them. (He is also great at that numbing shot--totally painless!!) I'm really grateful I stumbled across this Dental practice and I'm constantly telling friends about them. The office staff are all so nice and professional, it's easy to make appointments and things run so smoothly here. I love the text reminders for my appointments and they even have a financial/billing specialist who comes in and goes over things with you so you know what to expect. That is so helpful! I cannot recommend Oxnard Family Dentistry enough!<//Review>

I’ve have some very bad experiences with dentists in the past. They always want me to come in for routine check ups, bill my insurance, and send my happy self out the door without listening to any concerns I’ve had. At Oxnard Dentistry, Dr. Keihani and the entire staff are always very courteous and very thorough. I’ve never had the feeling of my concerns being dismissed, or the pressure of having a procedure or product pushed on me like I have at other dental office. I would give 10 starts if I could! Highly recommend :)< /Review>< pictures>

I love Oxnard Dentistry, the staff and my dentist always welcomes me with a great smile. I've been coming here for the past year to have ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ procedures done to me..I've had porcelain crowns, filings, 1 porcelain implant, & 3 molars were saved & replaced with crowns 💗. I loved that they were able to work with me on a payment plan specially on hard times during the pandemic..I HIGHLY RECOMMEND OXNARD DENTISTRY!! 👏😊< /Review>

<Text>Thank you so much to the endlessly patient and competent staff at Oxnard Dentistry. I came here from another office that did not care about my well being or suffering, and fully expected more disappointment and waiting and pain. Oxnard Dentistry saw me as soon as possible, listened to me, found the problem and immediately fixed it. All in a matter of 2 hours.

I am not an easy dental patient either. I spent my visit trembling and flinching at every sound and movement, but everyone was kind and patient with me. No one got irritated when I needed extra numbing shots. They wanted to ensure my procedure was as comfortable and pain free as possible. They also made sure to let me know that everything would be covered by my insurance, as that was something I was concerned with coming in.

I’m so glad I got a second opinion here. I think I’d still be in pain if I would have continued going to the other office.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

1st of all I wanted to try this office due to the reviews. They weren't wrong the front desk girls were nice and took my insurance, went to the back and a male hygienist did my teeth cleaning, cavity free!! I decided to do my teeth whitening, I'm in love with my smile and my pearly white. I  will be retuning back in 6 months for my next cleaning. Highly recommend them!!<//text>

I had an appointment with Oxnard Dentistry this past Saturday for my kids routine cleaning. Dr. Jabaiti is the most gentle and compassionate dentist  I've ever encountered. The hygienist Roberto was so kind with both of my children. The front desk is always so kind and the energy in that office was very familial and welcoming. Jessica and Andrea went above and beyond to makes my kids feel at ease and completely comfortable. This is an all around amazing practice.</review>

I myself and my children have been seen in this office. My first experience with this office was horrible the receptionist always gave me attitude and was defensive. I don’t recall her name she sits by the window she is short and she’s a little in the bigger side. I have been waiting for the authorization for my medical and I called myself to follow up with my insurance. Medical informed me this office never send over X-rays. This has been going on since July and I was experiencing a lot of pain at the moment. I called the office Jessica answered the phone I explain my situation to her. She apologize for my bad experience and stated she personally will take care of my authorization  and she will be helping me from now on. She went above and beyond to get this authorization going and approved. Within a week she had already gotten the approval and called me to schedule. Dr. Cohen is an amazing doctor the back staff was amazing and kind. Janet  helped me at the end with my balance, final receipt  and my next appointment she is professional and has a great personality. The only reason I’m giving a 3 star review was due to my previous experience.
I am glad, I gave Oxnard Dentistry a second chance. Thank you Dr. Cohen for always taking good care of me and my family.<//text>

Nice and clean office! Had a root canal done and I was in horrible pain. I was scheduled immediately and taken care of. I feel great now and I am relieved the ladies in the front took care of me and to the doctor as well who did such a great job on me.</text>

< Review>
I drive from Santa Barbara to Oxnard for all my dental work. Oxnard Dentistry is the BEST!!! Not only do they take Cen Cal insurance they did an amazing job and were able to replace old crowns with crowns that look and fit perfect!!! They took care of my fillings and matched my tooth color perfectly!
I can’t say enough great things about the staff and dentist at Oxnard Dentistry!</Review>

I really enjoyed my experience here at Oxnard Dentistry. They are very professional and have a caring and friendly group of staff. Very attentive and understandable. The Doctor that extracted my tooth did a awesome job making sure I was comfortable and the work was done in excellent timing. I will continue to have my dental work here and would recommend this office to anyone in the area.

Thank you

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>If I can give it a negative star I would. This past Saturday I called to see if I can be seen for an emergency. The lady who answered by the name of Andrea answer the phone and she said ”Saturday is only by appointments the insurances are closed and can't check your insurance.” I was explaining to her my situation and keep in mind I am in horrible pain. She would not listen or let me speak. She would keep arguing with me about how they can't see me today and keep giving me excuses to not see me. The website says ”Open for emergency” But when you call for an emergency they don’t  want to see you. She offer me an appointment for next week? Are you kidding me? No, I'm not calling this dental office again. Worst customer service ever over the phone! I wouldn't waste my time here.</Review>< Pics>

We are training an entirely new staff due to Covid and we apologize for any any inconvenience/pain that you subdued over the weekend.  I am so sorry you had this experience with us and would like to make it up to you. Would you be able email me directly with your telephone number to make it right. I do not like to see any of my patients or anybody that is in pain to be treated this way as this is not our standards whatsoever. If you are willing, please feel free to email me at OxnardDentistry@gmail.com to make this situation right, if possible. Thank you for your time."}< /Resp>

I’ve been going to Oxnard dentistry for the past 4 years.

Overall experience was excellent.  There were some misunderstanding about coverage of my PPO insurance but was cleared up. The Dentist is one the most caring doctor I have ever experienced.  Trust me I have mouth full of experiences I can compare to. One thing which I have noticed and I don't mean it negatively is that there are some training of newer assistants going on. That is good thing. Very efficiently run for a lot of patients that the doctors are taking care of. Would highly recommend Oxnard Dentistry.<//text>

<review>As a new patient I got an emergency appointment quickly when needed. Reception staff was friendly and efficient. Office was set up to meet Covid 19 safety guidelines.
My dentist, Dr. Cohen, took great care in evaluating my problem and clearly explained the options. He and the assistant were careful to ensure that I was comfortable during the procedure.
I am very glad that I found this dental practice and would highly recommend it.</review>< Pictures>

Just want to tell Dr. thank you for having his beautiful office open under these circumstances. I really needed dental work done and my dental office is still closed due too Covid. I really appreciate that you guys were able to do my exam, cleaning, and a few fillings on the same visit. You guys are amazing. Thank you soo much. I definitely will be referring patients to your office.</Text>

<text>I was looking forward to coming in to this dentistry due to all the good reviews but unfortunately my experience was not the best. I walked into the office to set up an appointment as a new patient. I waited 5 minutes to be acknowledge or greeted. The young lady sitting by the window said “Oh sorry didn’t see you there my monitor was blocking you.” I thought to myself why would you have a monitor that big that you are not able to see your patients that are walking in and need help!!????
In the process of her helping me I was asking her questions regarding my insurance. She stated with an attitude I’m the insurance coordinator, I wouldn’t be able to check it today.  I only check what’s on schedule. “I’ll check it when I have extra time and call you!” I asked for a manager  she said “The manager works from home, I can give her your number and she can call you!!. I just grabbed my stuff and left never coming back.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Always a quick and painless experience. I can always trust the assistants and the Dentist himself for whatever issue I have. I’d recommend everybody to a chance and see for yourself.<//Review>

<Review>As a new patient at this dental office, I had xrays and cleaning done which were great!. Upon review of my dental X-rays I was told I would need two new crowns (one of them being a root canal as well)  After getting my temporary crowns done the doctor told me I would be needing a root canal as mentioned earlier. The doctor then told me they would process my insurance and contact me to schedule an appointment  when it got approved to get everything done. Fast foreword four weeks later I still haven’t heard back from them so I contacted the office only to be told that they never submitted anything for authorization until I reached out to them. Then they went on to say I didn’t need a root canal, so I was confused and scheduled a consult only to find out there was a mistake and nothing was submitted for authorization until the consult! Over all I think the staff is friendly!  but I believe there is a lack of communication between the doctors and front office staff!

Sincerely, still waiting!</Review>< Pictures>

Our young son chipped a tooth on a Saturday morning. Oxnard Dentistry went above and beyond to get him seen right away and were so kind and professional. They also have excellent Covid protocol in place. Seriously impressed!</Text>

I’m so grateful that I met Dr. Jabaiti and his staff I wouldn’t know what I would of done, me teeth and smile better than ever. I’m so happy with my results, I removed my wisdom teeth did all cavities and they do not use any silver. The front desk staff called me to confirm and texted me to remind me about all my appointments I never met anyone people willing me to help me and go out of their way like Andrea, Jessica and Janelle!! I highly recommend this office to all my coworkers all the time. Thank you!!!!</Text>

My husband recently was in need of a dentist quickly for an emergency on a Saturday, l began an endless internet search of dentists that were open during this pandemic and weekends.  After several phone calls with rude receptionists I was ready to give up. I came across Oxnard Dentistry a listing from my insurance and called. His receptionist, Jessica was so kind and helpful she made an appointment immediately. As I walked into the office I was greeted by two young ladies. I asked for Jessica since she was helping me over the phone she went above and beyond to make sure my husband was well taken care of and made me feel comfortable. Talk about feeling like home! Easy. Dr. Keihani listens to him and was able to take take good care of him. The staff is friendly, courteous and took special interest in his care. I would recommend his facility with out hesitation to anybody who is looking for a great dentist. The office is clean and the staff are very courteous. Thank you Oxnard Dentistry.</text>

I must say that from the moment I walked in the door of Oxnard Dentistry until the moment I walked out, I was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy, far surpassed any expectations I could have ever had.  Because I ended up having to wait for a longer than normal amount of time between my initial exam and when they could get me back into a room to take care of my issues, one of the girls went next door and bought me a smoothie!!  I didn't even have enough focus to think about asking for a water (I don't like dentists, so I was very nervous), and almost before I had sat back down in the lobby, this wonderful young woman had handed me the smoothie!!  And i haven't even gotten to how caring and thoughtful the dentist and his assistant were!!  If I could give them 10 stars I would!!!  Don't go to any other dentist.   Go here, they will take care of you and then some!!< /review>

Staff are Bilingual and made my mom and dad feel comfortable. But, for their first visit, (during the "Pandemic"), they waited for about an hour. There was a compensation of $100 gift card for the wait, (For use at the Oxnard Dentistry).

*They are about 50% off services i.e. Dentures $393 for a single top or bottom w/ Insurance.< /review>

<Review>I inquired about an appointment for this dentistry and they were extremely helpful! I asked for the appointment over the phone and was met with a very warm greeting and a helpful service from a female employee named Jessica. It was pretty easy to set up and when I went in for the appointment the customer service was really good actually. Very nice people and very easy to set up appointments<//Review>< pics>

My first time at a dentist in a VERY long time, but it was very pleasant, root canal and everything. Very friendly and helpful. Felt no pain at all, which was great, since that's the reason most of us don't want to go to the dentist</Review>

Dental appointments can be a pain but the staff at Oxnard Dentistry really make each experience a wonderful one. Quick waiting room times, comfortable settings, attention to detail - I leave with all my questions answered and overall more informed about my oral health. The ladies are also a blast to talk to when you’re having an exam. Love my dentist!< /text>

The only reason I’m giving this place a bad review is due to the patient care the coordinator and Dentists gave me the day of my visit. I went into this office thinking I was going to have a great experience due to all these great reviews. But let me start by saying that all I got done was x-rays, exam and a headache (keep in mind I had a bad toothache)  the doctor was in a rush he didn't answer my question he was speaking so fast I couldn't understand him. After the doctor exam, my mouth and review my X-rays. I was left with the coordinator she had no patience with me. I went home confused with no answer no teeth cleaning no prescription and nobody bothered to follow up with me. I had to call the office to follow up with my dental care. A young lady answered my call after I explain my situation and my experience to her. She apologized for the bad experience, I had the day of my visit. She offer to help me. She was very helpful and kind. She was able to call in a prescription for me and had the Dentist call me to follow up with me.</review>

WARNING this  place is false advertisement!
This past Saturday I was in horrible pain. I called the office all day nobody answered. The website states open from 8am-4pm yet nobody answered my calls or called me back on Monday. I decided to give it another try and called Monday afternoon. A lady by the name of Lorena answered and was so rude instead of apologizing she clearly said with an attitude “we’ll what do you want me to do?”  Don’t waist your time here worst service and office ours don’t reflect what they have on the website.<//Review>

I had not been to a dentist in a few years now, walked in to my appointment with some reservations of what my experience would be like. Everyone was so wonderful and for the first time I caught “fillings”💖☺️ ( No really I needed fillings and had my first cavity, maybe I should have sought preventative care sooner 🤓😂 Ha!) The staff was welcoming, kind and patient with all of the questions. First time I leave the Dentist looking forward to my next visit. 👍🏻Thank you all for being so wonderful💙💞.</review>

I went in because I needed a tooth pulled (due to my own negligence) and midway through the process it was discovered that I had an infection in my gum. Dr. Keihani put me on antibiotics to kill the infection and finished the procedure about a week later. Everything went smooth. He scheduled a follow up a little over a week later and everything went well. Definitely a great service and he saved me a bunch of money by not sending me to an Oral Surgeon mid procedure due to my infection. Definitely recommended.<//Text>

I went in with a lot of pain on a molar when it came to sentivieness to hot/cold or tapping on it...They put a crown on it which i covered with CareCredit to then destroy de crown do a root canal and instead of recrowning it they filled it up.

Now im still in pain even after a root canal and have to pay another $300 for a city scan that will most likely end up on my molar getting destroyed to work on again.

This has been going on for a while...i went in for 1 thing just 1 tooth and now im stuck on a loophole....Im calling carecredit to get refunded for the crown.

If any medical malpractice attorney reads this please reach out.<//text>< Pics>

Dr. Kehlani was an absolute GEM. I have a lifelong dentist phobia and tons of anxiety surrounding any dental work and had to go in for some extreme tooth pain. It turns out I needed an emergency root canal, which was so scary but Dr. Cohen had me completely at ease. It was by far the most calm and composed I have ever been at the dentist, and that was 100% thanks to him. Plus, even in the COVID environment I felt completely safe. The xray machines were even in each individual room, so I didn't have to go to a communal one, which was nice. I would definitely recommend Oxnard Dentistry, and especially Dr. Cohen, to anyone who needs a little help feeling comfortable at the dentist. All the staff were also extremely patient and kind, which was a big plus.</Text>

I wanted to delete and rewrite my previous review, but don't see that option. I'd like to take a minute to clarify. Because of a lapse in coverage, I'd not been to a dentist or had prescriptions filled in way too long, thus I had a couple of issues that were becoming painful and annoying. Based on reviews, I chose Oxnard Dental. The office was spotless, the front desk girls were on point and courteous and I didn't wait an unusual amount of time to be seen. The exam was thorough and explained in detail from procedure to pricing. The areas I took exception to at the time were greatly exacerbated by the pain I was experiencing and my stressed out frame of mind. The review I wrote reflected this and wasn't meant to be sent. Just venting then deleting. Ever have a day like that? Imagine my surprise when I was contacted by the office with much concern regarding my visit. I'm withdrawing my previous review on my own volition. I've not been coerced or bribed in any way. It simply wasn't fair or correct. They were respectful in their follow-up, and sincerely concerned with my care. I look forward to working with them regarding my dental care in the future.</text>

I have a lot of anxiety just at the thought of going to any doctor but after letting a cracked tooth go far too long without being seen it was finally necessary to go. After reading reviews online I chose this dentistry and couldn't be happier that I did. From the moment I walked in the staff were welcoming, attentive and understanding to my specific situation. I ended up needing a root canal, which I knew was a possibility and the best part is that they do everything there so I was able to have it done the same day. No getting a referral and wasting time going to another place! I waited the 2 weeks to get my crown before writing this review and within the 2 weeks everything was great. The Dr. even took my call to discuss concerns I had with my pain after the root canal and made time to see me to make sure everything was fine which it was. I highly recommend this place and contrary to previous reviews I do not need a Starbucks gift card to do so. Their service speaks for itself.< /review><rate>5</rate><name>T G<//name></record>

Staff was very friendly and helpful and their offer for the new patient for $65 teeth cleaning is a great deal. However, I was very dissatisfied when after my x-rays I did not receive a teeth cleaning but instead was told about other issues that had to be fixed with my teeth. Personally I would had liked to at least gotten the service that I paid for done and then came back to go along with the other things that I needed fixed with my teeth. Paid $65 to walk in and not receive a teeth cleaning and then just walk right back out. I was not happy at all.<//Review>

Every single worker there was nice and caring and I grew a friendship with the workers. I don’t get too scared anymore due to the fact that the doctors are well established and wise when it comes to my teeth. I trust every single one of then and would recommend this dentistry to anyone looking for a very good job done right.</Text>

< Review>
Walked in as a new patient.  Promptly helped by the team at the reception desk and enrolled.  They got me in the same day even though it was busy.

Dentist took a look and gave me a detailed plan going forward.

Excellent staff, friendly and attentive including the dental assistants and administrative staff.  I can see why the ratings are so high.

The wallpaper in the medical rooms is a tropical beach scene with white sand and crystal clear  blue water which faces the patient in the dental chair.  It might sound gimmicky but it's actually extremely soothing and comforting as many people have anxiety and fear at the dentist office.  Very nice touch.

He is the kindest, most gentle dentist you could want.  He explains everything before he does any treatment and is FAST.  Things are finished before you know he started.

He is the kind of person we're fortunate to have in our community and the kind of professional you'll want working on you if you need a good - no make that GREAT - dentist.

And the staff at Oxnard Dentistry is also GREAT.</Text><Name>Jay Berger<//Name>< Rating>

I applied for care credit my agreement was for $746.80 which I signed for. They went ahead and sent me an extra payment for $24.60 which I didn’t agree on. I have receipts that prove the $746.80 and not an added payment. I’m very upset and I may reach out to Better Business Bureau!< /Text>

When I called they were very polite and answered all my questions. They also worked with my schedule. When I got to the facility they were very fast and efficient. When I was called to the back the handled my mouth with care and explained everything to me and advised me as much as they could. I’m glad I chose them to be my Dentist office 👍🏽<//review>

I would recommend this place to anyone but especially people with any dental anxiety/phobias. I was extremely scared to go to the dentist and ended up needing to get work done. They were able to take me same day for an appointment and to complete the work. They helped me work everything out with insurance and I feel like the pricing is fair. The office and waiting area are nice, clean and comfortable - you feel like you're at home. Dr. K and his assistants and receptionists are all very nice and caring. They helped me stay calm and were patient with me, giving me breaks when I needed them and explaining everything thoroughly. This is the only dentist I'll be going to from now on. Thank you so much!!< /text>

<review>Janelle is so awesome, she helped me out at the front desk and got me situated :). The dentist himself is great and very thorough with every treatment he is doing. Crystal the hygienist made me feel comfortable and she made it quick and painless. All the ladies at that office are definitely professional and know how to make you feel at ease. Definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a dental office who actually makes you look forward to your appointments!<//review>< Pics>

Today I went for a clean up, and I had a great experience. I was seen right at my appointment time, and the dental hygienist who cleaned my teeth was already in the room waiting for me. I also liked that the office assistants called me a few weeks ago to set up that appointment, as I couldn't remember when I had my previous dental clean up. This is my second time going into this clinic, and while I live 20 minutes away, it's worth it for the service. Highly recommend it.</review>

The dentists & all of the staff at "Oxnard Dentistry" in Oxnard are warm super super-friendly folks!! The office building inside and outside looks so nice and totally brand new! The interior decor is gorgeous and beautifully designed!  The lounge area/waiting area has a huge TV featuring interesting cable channels to watch!! Everything inside is ultra-clean and spotless! The intercom plays excellent varieties of music that all people will enjoy! Cedar Sinai Hospital in Beverly Hills ESPECIALLY,CAREFULLY and VERY THOROUGHLY TRAINS ALL DOCTORS AND STAFF TO *ALWAYS* BE COURTEOUS AND FRIENDLY TO ALL OF IT' S  PATIENTS!! I NOTICE THAT OXNARD DENTISTRY DOCTORS AND EVERYONE ON THEIR STAFF TREATS EVERY PERSON WHO WALKS IN THE DOOR, IN THE EXACT SAME FRIENDLY CARING WAY!!!! GOD BLESS EVERYBODY WHO WORKS AT OXNARD DENTISTRY OFFICES IN OXNARD!! THEY ARE REALLY  VERY DEDICATED SPECIAL DENTAL PROFESIONALS! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!< /text>

I recently visited Oxnard Dentistry and had a wonderful experience. The staff is very friendly and efficient. Dr. Tariq Jabaiti is very attentive and he made me feel comfortable throughout my visit. He made sure I was happy with his work and got exactly what I wanted. Highly recommend this Dr and office! Oh, and he's easy on the eyes ;)<//review>

< Review>
I recently had a deep cleaning and a few cavities filled at Oxnard Dentistry. Walking into Oxnard Dentistry I was a nervous wreck and my anxiety was absolutely through the roof and apparently very noticeable. However, the staff at Oxnard Dentistry soon noticed my uncomfortableness and made my experience one to remember. I have never not been hurt by the dentist in my past experiences, however at Oxnard Dentistry I walked out tearless and was so pleased with my experience. The cleaning and fillings went so smoothly and painless I was so relieved and surprised to have such an awesome experience!! Thank you so much for taking my anxiety about the dentist into consideration and constantly checking in on how I was doing throughout the whole appointment. They actually made me not hate the dentist and I no longer mind going back. Thank you thank you thank you!<//Review>

<Review>I went to this dental office for a regular cleaning. This was my first time visiting this office. It appeared I was overdue for an x-ray, so I got one. When I sat in the chair, I told the dental assistant that I had been having issues chewing, and that my jaw was clicking. I don’t always believe in self diagnosis, but I mentioned that I had the symptoms of a condition I read about online. The x-ray looked clear, but the dentist recommended me for a root canal because he said I had a crack in my tooth that we couldn’t see on the x-ray because an x-ray is “2D”. I knew that was incorrect because that is the point of an x-ray; to see through your tooth for any informalities (bone wise). The dentist then told me he experienced the same thing. I was told the work would be about $900, and that I could schedule a follow up appointment at the desk. Little did he know, I knew that if there was a crack in my tooth, I would have had different symptoms, and we would have seen the crack on the x-ray. Also, I have had multiple dental appointments in life, and I have always heard I have a very strong set of teeth. They tried to rip me off. If I would have let him, they would have cut the joint in my tooth, and I would have had this root canal for the rest of my life, even though he knew I did not need one. Needless to say, it’s been a couple of months since this visit, and my jaw has been back to normal for a while. BEWARE OF THIS OFFICE. I may even reach out to the Better Business Bureau to report this. I knew better, but my biggest fear is that someone else would not, and they would have this permanent work done on them even though they did not need it.< /Review>< Time>

<Review>I am someone who doesn’t go in to the dentist without absolutely needing to and even then, I walk out when I find something that I don’t like. I’ll literally sit there looking for something so that I can be able to justify walking out. From the moment I walked in, the ladies in the front were super nice and made me feel welcomed. The ladies in the back, we’re also really nice and once they saw how nervous I was they made sure to comfort me and talk to me to distract me and keep me comfortable. The dentist went over and beyond when it came to answering all my questions. He looks super young but he is very knowledgeable and wasn’t pushy about anything and took his time with me. So needless to say.. I didn’t have any complaints and ended up getting my teeth cleaned and made a second appointment to fix a cavity. I highly recommend this place< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80e84c1431fd46eb:0xa199066387d8b989< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Family had an appointment in this office about a week ago. My reason for my one star is because I felt like my parents were turned down and not helped. My mom received a phone call from Andrea from the insurance department informing us she was not assigned to this dental office. She asked my parents to come in at an earlier time and she would help them call the insurance to get assigned to Oxnard dentistry. My mom and dad arrive to the appointment and they asked for Andrea. Once My mom informed her she was there for her appointment. She said to my mom you’re not assigned to our office so we can see you today! My mom tried telling her that she asked her to com in early to help her get assigned  to the office. She told my mom she never said that that she needs to call herself on her own time and get assigned. What gets me upset is why does she have these patients come in telling them over the phone she’s going to help them but once they arrive to the appointment she doesn’t help them that. My parents came home informed me of what had happened and it got me really upset. They need to work on the customer service. My parents are Hispanic and they only speak Spanish so I’m not sure if she didn’t want to help because they are Spanish-speaking. My parents were not held or satisfied with the customer service.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Professional and friendly staff. Crystal was the hygienist and did a thorough job (spent at least 30 minutes cleaning each of us and didn’t inflict the usual pain received from past hygienists).<//text>

Beware! I got almost 1200$ worth of dental work. A partial crown fixed and the whitening treatment. The dentist intentionally put a partial crown on a cavity so that I would have to get a root canal which is a very expensive procedure. I have been in pain for a month. They also never gave me my whitening kit that goes with the whitening procedure. The whole procedure is a rip off! Please becareful!<//text>

They accommodated me very well when I was a new patient and I had a broken molar. They helped me sign up for care credit in order to pay for my crown. They made sure I was numb for my root canal. All in all they were very professional and nice.< /Text>

< Review>
The staff is so nice and very welcoming. The xray technician was so sweet and kept me comfortable the while she xrayed my teeth. I had the best cleaning I have ever had with Crystal. She is professional, informative, and an overall joy. Her and Dr. Keihani made sure that I understood what types of procedures I needed and why. I left feeling very confident with my decisions. Thank you Oxnard Dentistry!</Review>

Customer service 7/10
Attentiveness 9/10
Dental works 8/10
Appointment reminder 10/10

Overall I had a great experience with Oxnard Dentistry. They were great reminding me of my appointment and everything got done in a timely manner. Customer service can use some improvement but it was not that bad.</Text>

Dr Kehani has a caring heart. He is very careful, thorough and patient in his work. I realize that the work of a dentist is not easy; yet he displays excellent work ethics and professionalism in providing excellent care for his patients. I highly recommend Oxnard Dentistry to everyone seeking a trustworthy dentist. You will not be disappointed.< /review>

I went in there for deep cleaning last month . It was very convenient for me as they’re are in the vicinity I live in .In my 3 visits with the office I noticed that all the staff is very courteous and polite. Dr.’s are very friendly and genuine.Real professional Dentists. There prices are also very reasonable. I would recommend anyone to go there and check them out .<//Text>

Fantastic front desk and beautiful ladies that always remind you of your appointment through text, email and a phone call. I had a hard time getting back to the dentist and the Drs made it pleasurable for me. Good people all around and a very clean office.</text>

Dr Kehani has a caring heart. He is very careful, thorough and patient in his work. I realize that the work of a dentist is not easy; yet he displays excellent work ethics and professionalism in providing excellent care for his patients. I highly recommend Oxnard Dentistry to everyone seeking a trustworthy dentist. You will not be disappointed.<//review>

<review>No one likes to go to the dentist, it's just not a fun place.  Oxnard Dentistry makes it better.  The staff is wonderful, the office is clean, and all of the procedures are pain free.  Okay, at least the first two things are true... and everyone there tries to make to make sure the procedures are as painless as possible; from billing to drilling – they are there for you every step of the way.  Dr. Cohen and Dr. Keihani are caring and compassionate; they want to ensure you have your smile forever!  I wouldn't go anywhere else.< /review>< pics>

Very friendly and helpful staff. The Office is super nice, modern and clean. My son was a new patient, he had a tooth ache and I was able to get him in to see the dentist the next day.  The wait to  be taken to the back is very minimal which is a huge plus for me. Very impressed with their services.  :)< /Text>

By far best experience I’ve ever i get major anxiety when it comes to the dentist but i looked into a few read some reviews and this place got my attention so I decided to check it out from the moment you walk in the girls in the front are friendly and supper helpful when it came to the exam I mentioned it right from the start that I get anxious both the assistant and dentist made sure I was doing good thru out the entire process I will be back for my wisdom teeth removal so I will update on that but they made me feel more comfortable about coming in for that procedure as well (:<//text>

My experience as a new patient was above and beyond expectation. The office is very professional and friendly. I liked Dr. Keihani  he was gentle and I was pain free. He and his assistant did an excellent job. Thank you so much for the excellent service you provided. I look forward to returning. I am happy I was referred to your office.< /review>

Awesome, I love it here, first time and I will be making this my new dental office..the girls were super helpful and kind and friendly , definitely recommend to others. Went in for some deep cleaning and I was comfortable. The first day Dr. introduced himself to me. The 2nd procedure was a different dentist and he didn’t even say his name just started digging. But all was fine I was satisfied. I’ll be back for some more work , Thanks y’all for getting my smile back. 😀< /text>

Very pleasant experience. The office has a lovely modern setting and very friendly staff. I was offered a warm cup of coffee while I waited and the doctor was very kind and gentle. They took care of all my dental needs and informed me on how to keep a healthy smile. I look forward to coming back. Thank you for my beautiful smile.< /Text>

Dr Keihani is an excellent dentist. His hand skills are top notch and I'm very satisfied with not only his knowledge but his staff is super nice!!! I grew up with so much fear of the dentist but Oxnard Dentistry made me feel at ease. I got my teeth whitened and now I feel so confident in my smile.<//Text>

To begin with I'm a person impressed with looks this place looks AMAZING!! It feels serene walking in and that's from a person who gets a breakdown from fear of the dentist. But the receptionist are friendly, as well as the hygienist always make me feel comfortable. The doctor himself is really nice and looks out for the best needs your teeth make. Only reason why I didn't give 4 stars is cuz I have certain fees I have to pay out of pocket now which sucks since my insurance covered more before at my previous dentist.< /Review>

Had a great experience at this brand new office after being referred to Dr. Keihani. Great doctor and friendly staff. I'll be going back for the rest of my procedures and would definitely recommend this place. Also, the office itself is amazing, extremely modern and clean with the latest equipment.</Review>

Best Dentistry I’ve ever been to. I got referred by my father. Very friendly and caring staff and an excellent, nice, clean and organised environment! I am impressed. Dr. Keihani does such an excellent job! Very to-the-point, knowledgable and very friendly. Got less nervous during my second visit for crown placement. Would highly recommend this Dentistry. Outstanding service.</Review>

Best dentist I have been to! I found it by chance as I needed some emergency work done.  Great office, friendly and nice front office, great nurses and almost everything they do is to perfection. Not always on time but it does not matter because they will spend as much time as needed to make it perfect. Dr. Keihani is very good with needle and a perfectionist! I’d love to go there as much as anybody likes to go to dentist. This is a great place to be!!!< /text>

Had a very pleasant experience at this brand new practice. Dr Keihani is very knowledgeable and very gentle.

Best TEETH CLEANING that I have ever got. He uses this special device to remove the stains from your teeth.

Definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>As many of you know, finding a good dentist is incredibly difficult these days. It's often challenging to get an appointment when needed, or service/atmosphere is below average...but not at Oxnard Dentistry. This beautiful new location has it all. The staff is just as classy as the location, and you'll always walk away satisfied with the results.

Dr. Keihani is by far one of the kindest, most caring dental professionals I've ever met. He is passionate about his craft and really puts the patient first. He asks all the right questions to ensure he's giving you the proper dental treatment and leaves you feeling completely comfortable while he works his magic.

If you're looking for a new dentist in the Oxnard area, look no further. Dr.K is who you want and you won't be disappointed with the experience at Oxnard Dentistry.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<user>113359079277948389857</user><text>The last time I went to the dentist was about five years ago. My dentist said I had great teeth, so I took that as an excuse not to go back to the dentist...EVER. But it came time that I needed to see one. I literally went to the offices of two other dentists before walking into Oxnard Dentistry. The other two just had bad mojo. Oxnard Dentistry had a different vibe, and the second I met Dr. K, I knew that he was the reason the office felt that way. He is maybe the most chill doctor I've ever come across. Not chill as in a hippie who wears flip flops to work, but he was calm, knew what he was talking about, and he had a confidence about him that made me feel more secure for being in his dentist chair. I had a few cavities that he took care of, didn't feel anything, and I was out. Best experience yet at any doctor's office. Highly recommended.<//text>< Time>

Terrible. These reviews are all fake. They offer a 5 dollar starbucks gift card for the people to give a good review but i dont need a giftcard. They give you a time for your appointment but dont call u in until an hour or two later. Like why say the appointment is at 2 (random time) but end up calling the patient in at 3 or 4. Get the time right not everyone has an hour or two to wait to get called in. When we get there we expect around a 10-20 min wait maybe 30 but when its an hour or two thats way too much. Terrible place<//review>

I went to Dr Keihani to consult regarding a broken tooth.
He was so conservative and tried everything to save my own tooty without damaging it and shaving it off too much.
He gave me the most painless shot he is the best<//Review>

Haven't gone to the dentist in years and Dr. Keihani made me feel at ease. The staff is very personable and knowledgeable. I feel like I'm in good hands. Dr. Keihani makes sure that I'm comfortable and numb before starting any procedures.</Text>

<Text>best dental cleaning I have ever had.
I cannot believe this office accepts Medical insurance.
The office is gorgeous and you feel like you are in a spa. They offered me coffee and water while I was waiting to get my teeth cleaned.
Very nice and professional front staff.
Dr Keihani does not rush and spends time with his patients. He used a special stain remover to remove all the stains and cleaned my teeth in a way that no other dentist ha ever cleaned them.<//Text>< Rating>

Never in my life have I enjoyed going to the dentist & I'm already looking forward to going back to Dr Kehani in 6 months. Beautiful office with a friendly, gentle staff. I referred 2 collegues right away because everyone should have a dentist they actually WANT to go to.<//text>

My smile is so much brighter. Everyone has been amazed at the results. I put off having this work done for far too long, out of fear.  Finally, I have found a dentist I can trust. Dr. Keihani does excellent work. He explains the procedures. He doesn't rush through the procedures as so many dentists do. He was very gentle and I had no pain. Office is gorgeous, modern and welcoming. Very friendly, caring staff and enviroment. Latest technology.<//text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Actually my wife was a patient here. I came to pick up my wife and I spoke to Dr. Keihani about a treatment that I wanted to do. I asked him random questions and he answered me.
I decided to cancel my appointment with my regular dentist and came to see him.
He look at my conditions and he referred me to a specialist. He said I don't want to take money from you and lie to you.
Dr. Keihani is a you well educated man. An honest man. Who really cares about his patients. I would recommend anyone to go to him for dental care. His staff is very nice, friendly and helpful.
Finally Dr. Keihani said to me drop by if needed for advice. I would recommend this place for adults and kids. You will not regret. It's worth cos you will not get better service in Oxnard.</Text>< rate>

Dr. Kehani was one of the best and most professional dentists I've ever seen
Always has available appointments unlike other dentists that take 3 months
When you talk to him he answers all questions that maktes you feel secure and relaxed
This is a dentist you can trust believe me
Not a thing to complain about<//text>

living in LA, you have many choices for different things including finding a dentist. Having gone to numerous dentists in the past, I had become frustrated not being able to find a dentist who actually cared about their patient's well being. I had many bad experiences in the past and was scared to face another disappointment. I was referred to Oxnard dentistry by a friend after having some pain and decided to try them out. My experience was excellent from the start to finish. The doctors and staff are extremely professional, friendly and caring. They took care of all my dental needs and made me into a loyal patient that will be coming back for future visits. Thank you doctor Keihani and team for taking great care of me. I will refer you to friends and family! :)< /Review>

<Text>Had to go in to a dentist ASAP after I felt some aching pain from not one tooth but two. I was getting a bit worried as it was becoming worst and worst within just a few day so I decided to look up a dentist and see what my options are. I can usually sustain pain and take some aspirin but this time I could feel something much deeper so I searched Google and Yelp and found Oxnard Dentistry. Read the 5 star reviews made an appointment. The front office manager, Vanessa, was super nice and I felt like she truly cared that I was in pain. As soon as I came in I was like, WOW, this place is so beautiful. Was hoping for a nice staff and received even better service than I’ve ever come across. The receptionist and staff were all on point and took care of me ASAP. As soon as they took an X-ray the Doctor said I had fractured both of my teeth. I truly couldn’t believe it.

Dr. Keihani is such a nice Dentist and went over some options that I had however, I went with extraction. I didn’t even feel the injection. Angelic hands!!!  Dr. prescribed me some meds and am healing nicely. Do yourself a favor and check Dr. Keihani and his staff out, you will not be disappointed.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80e84c1431fd46eb:0xa199066387d8b989< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Had to go in to a dentist ASAP after I felt some aching pain from not one tooth but two. I was getting a bit worried as it was becoming worst and worst within just a few day so I decided to look up a dentist and see what my options are. I can usually sustain pain and take some aspirin but this time I could feel something much deeper so I searched Google and Yelp and found Oxnard Dentistry. Read the 5 star reviews made an appointment. The front office manager, Vanessa, was super nice and I felt like she truly cared that I was in pain. As soon as I came in I was like, WOW, this place is so beautiful. Was hoping for a nice staff and received even better service than I’ve ever come across. The receptionist and staff were all on point and took care of me ASAP. As soon as they took an X-ray the Doctor said I had fractured both of my teeth. I truly couldn’t believe it.

Dr. Keihani is such a nice Dentist and went over some options that I had however, I went with extraction. I didn’t even feel the injection. Angelic hands!!!  Dr. prescribed me some meds and am healing nicely. Do yourself a favor and check Dr. Keihani and his staff out, you will not be disappointed.< /Review>

I had such an amazing experience at this dental office. Going to the dentists is not one of my favorite things to do, but Dr. Keihani really changed my view on going to the dentist. He has such a gentle touch and I felt no pain throughout the whole process. I felt so much confidence in my smile after my cleaning. I don't always look at where the my doctors and dentists go to school but when I found out he was a USC Dental Scool graduate, I could definitely tell the difference in his quality of work, service, and demeanor. I recommended my boyfriend and family members to go to his office as well. He is type of dentist you can trust because he is really looking out for the best interest of his patients.</text>

<Review>I was looking for a primary dentist in my area and luckily found Dr. Keihani at Oxnard Dentistry. He is one of the most kindest and caring Dentists I've ever came across. His patience and love for dentistry goes un-noticed. I was told I needed to change a filling by my previous dentist, however Dr. Keihani assured me that it's sealed and that he'd monitor it. I love that he wasn't money hungry and wasn't trying to up sell me on anything. He truly cares for his patients. I'm definitely telling family and friends about Oxnard Dentistry.

STAFF- The front desk, Vanessa was super nice and energetic and was accommodating with my crazy schedule.

OFFICE- absolutely gorgeous and stunning. Everything is brand new and they use state of the art technology. They do laser dentistry!!!

Lastly, I have PPO insurance, however my mother has Medicaid-  they take all insurances- so I was able to take in my mom while I went in for my appointment as well.

Thank you, Oxnard Dentistry<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>Dr. Kourosh Keihani and his team are by far the best in the industry! I have been going to Dr. Keihani for a couple years now and his work and gentle care is like no other dentist. His office is brand new, completely immaculate and has all of the latest technology. It is an understatement to say that Dr. Keihani is a conservative dentist. He painlessly resolves any dental issue that comes up and has superb chair side manner to put my mind at ease. He saved my tooth and kept me from needing a root canal!! I can say I am 100% confident in all of his work. He also got some cosmetic work done with him for an amazing price. Dr completely whitened my smile and gave me more confidence. I'm extremely thankful I have a dentist like him and I don't ever plan on going anywhere else! If you want a comforting and accommodating dentist with very affordable prices, go to him.</Text>< Pictures>

All the girls in front are very respectful! Andrea helped me with the insurance because I don't know very well about it! I recommend the Oxnard Dentistry office to everyone.

(Translated by Google) Dr Keihani is 100% recommended for his excellent work, charisma and not to mention how patient he was with me as he came with a horrible experience from another dentist.
I appreciate the recommendation to this dentist and I can say that you will be in good hands, the material he uses and the staff he has are the best! !
