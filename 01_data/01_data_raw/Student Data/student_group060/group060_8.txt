<time>1622123973697<//time><text>Enjoy human representatives while they last. It wouldn’t be surprising if Robinhood decided to reduce their manpower again and reduce labor costs when the company becomes public.

What’s the point of even hiring people if you’re just going to train them to be mindless robots who don’t personalize emails or answer every question asked?

How difficult is it to develop an automated AI phone operator system to direct us to an agent?

Change the way you operate or else people will find something better:

1) Humans are more important than Hardware
2) Quality is better than Quantity
3) A competent workforce cannot be mass produced especially during emergency situations</text><Gmap_id>0x808fbb1264ce9459:0x8d2e925360dad18<//Gmap_id><response>None< /response><rate>3< /rate>< name>

<Text>Anyone who has used the Robinhood App knows how user friendly it is compared to other brokerages. With that said, that was a heavy consideration why they received 2 stars, opposed to 1 star. Robinhood customer service is terrible, they have zero execution.

I transferred stocks out of Robinhood to another brokerage. Robinhood is responsible to provide the receiving brokerage with the cost basis for tax purposes. They are refusing to send the necessary documents to the other brokerage and keep putting me off. It has already been 4 months.

Is Robinhood responsible enough to handle people's finances? I'm not sure, they seem to continue have issues. On the back end they seem very unprofessional.< /Text><date>1617729249715</date>< resp>

Robinhood has disabled me from sending money to my bank account for no reason and no email telling me they did this. They finally emailed me to resend my id and confirm my telephone number but gave me no way to do this. Now they will not respond. They are crooks and don't have the balls to talk to you.<//Text>

I gave them 1 star because zero stars is not an option. This company is 100% a scam. They execute market buy orders sometimes $5-10 over the estimated price, and market sells at $5-10 under the estimated price. The "zero commission" bull***t is a lie. They steal a % from you on every trade. On top of that, they often don't even have the underlying for the securities you purchase. It's all a giant shell game and the executives of this scam company belong in prison or at the end of a rope. Don't waste your time, they will steal from you. Limit orders won't execute. Market orders will be filled at the worst possible price. Make sure to short this stock when the company goes public.<//review>

Unauthorized charges to my bank account over $7000. Took over a week to resolve no thanks to Robin Hood. This company has zero legal or moral integrity and hold them self to a zero accountability level. Td Ameritrade or E trade or much better options to trade with.</review>

This company is FRAUDULENT. I've been transferring my shares to a different broker, Vanguard. Every stock I've owned has been successfully transferred over--except for 2 stocks: AMC & GME.

3 requests to transfer over and Vanguard reports: Robinhood has been rejecting ALL of them!

I don't understand this. How are all my other stocks able to transfer over without question, but GME & AMC cannot?

This is offensive. Especially after that huge fiasco earlier this year. Bottom line: MANIPULATING the stock when retail investors are UNABLE TO ACCESS THEIR OWN SHARES.

Get your act together. Regulatory agencies are being informed.<//text>

I tried to cash out my small account with Robinhood.  They were supposed to PUT the cash in my bank account, instead they doubled down and TOOK that amount out of my bank account!  You CAN NOT TALK TO A PERSON with Robinhood! When you try and look up "close account" their useless app says "page not found"!  When you call them at either of the two numbers that show up on a search, they tell you via a recording to "use the app" and hang up on you!  I would rate this company as a scam at this point, and only time will tell if I escalate this to a legal matter!  Stay away from this company!</text>

<review>Try to get your money from Robinhood. Good luck! It requires confirmation code to confirm your bank account. However, I can't get this code in my Inbox for days. There is no way to email or call the company. The company hides this information on purpose. Thus, you can't get your money when you need it.
It's absolutely not reliable brokerage.
Also, there are several recent alarming articles about Robinhood on Bloomberg, Forbes, Barron's and etc. Tons of complains on social media about Robinhood.
Might be I never get my money.
Sounds like investors are in big trouble....</review><Date>1607119021865<//Date>< Rate>

<review>If you have more than 10k portfolio Stay away, no customer support. Limited atm withdrawal $1010 per day 5k per month. I needed to purchase a vehicle so I tried to withdraw 10k it was impossible so I lost the deal, plus I got a generic email from computer service 3 days later (no customer service). This should be listed as a scam. Imagine you make some money and a stock you pick and you wanted to take some money out for a big purchase ...you can't. I even went to my bank and had them swipe my card for a no fee cash advance,  declined declined declined couldn't believe it. Stash is way better at least you have someone to talk to and stash let you do up 10k cash advance.

<review>Customer service scares me!

I got the account holder name wrong when I filled out my application.  The “algorithm” wouldn’t allow me to go back and make a correction.   It did continue to send me reminders to complete the application (calling me by the incorrect name).

Requests for help from customer service generated canned replies (to the wrong person). At this point, even if they fixed the problem, I would never trust them with my money.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><user>109231424849080341406<//user><Rating>3< /Rating>< Name>

Do not put your money in this app.
These guys have zero customer support. If anything odd happens. You’re on your own. They will not reply Emails. There’s no number to call because they don’t have anyone to answer them.

Robinhood should be shutdown as a brokerage.

I had to open a different brokerage and have them pull my money through for me because Robinhood restricted me without explanation and wouldn’t let me pull my money.

Robinhood did not reply to repeated emails regarding issues with my account.

Again, Robinhood should be shut down as a broker.<//Review>

It took them a FULL calendar week for them to move cash from my bank to their account and in that time, I missed out on thousands of dollars of gains I could have had from taking advantage of the cryptocurrency dip over thanksgiving week. I don’t know why it takes a week, but obviously something isn’t right and I sure won’t depend on this app to trade any substantial amount of money on crypto ever again and I’m probably just going to move my money back to my bank and go with some sort of exchange to do crypto instead.  A full week to transfer funds is unacceptably slow....but I guess I’m getting what I pay for....massive opportunity cost.<//text>

<Review>NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.  heed the advice of many other reviewers here - THERE IS NO WAY TO GET LIVE SUPPORT FROM ROBINHOOD.  you can't call a phone number to speak to someone, and they have no chat.  the only option is to send an email and wait 1-3 business days for them to reply.  and even that is BS - i can show anyone email threads where they have taken as long as a month to respond me.  think about this real hard - if you're having an issue with your hard earned money and need assistance, are you ok with waiting days (and possibly weeks) just to get a response from your bank/broker??<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>i opened an account with robinhood recently and bought some stocks.  yesterday i placed an order to sell my shares at $72 a share which i had bought it for $62.23.  this morning i noticed they had sold my shares off BUT at a price of $62.28!!!  how could i have made such an error, if any, and sell the stocks at only 5 cents above what i paid for!?!?

i tried to reach them by phone but it disconnects and does not allow to proceed.  i wrote them thrice and have not heard a word from them except a canned reply of password change!!!  what the heck!?

btw. my shares are now trading at $63 or so.< /Text><gmap_id>0x808fbb1264ce9459:0x8d2e925360dad18<//gmap_id>< Response>

Froze my account for no reason. They will not answer my emails or other attempts to contact them. They are holding 15,000 of my money and there is nothjng I can do about it until they decide to answer my messages. It has been 8 days and counting.  Meanwhile, I can pay bills. Corrupt!<//review>

A couple of weeks ago I tried withdrawing $1,500ish dollars. However, Robinhood had a plan to waste my time and energy. if you would like to know the story, read below:

I started looking for new places to live. I was using Robinhood to turn my savings into potential cash income. However, right before all of this happened my bank account got frauded so I had to make a new one. I had no idea how much a pain this would end up causing me indirectly. So, when I went to withdraw my money I was told that I could not because of unsettled funds. I get that, its whatever. So i waited and then I reached back out 1 week later. Then I was told that I could withdraw roughly 1/2 of my money but that it would take 10 days because I put money into the account with (Old) an account and took it out with a new account. After this 10 days and me having 1/2 of my money I reached back out to robinhood. I asked if I could get the remaining funds. They then told me that I could not get my money out because they gave me a $7 stock and that amount of funds is required to be in the account for 30 days. Well, this 30 day mark was on 6/12/2020 and I was told today that this is the same reason that I cannot access my own money. I reached out with questions regarding this 2-3 times and was blown off every time. I then tried finding a phone number to call only to be told on the call that I can only use their website. Therefore, I am frustrated with Robinhoods lack of transparency, customer service, and overall morals. This organization had an opportunity to get a client for a lifetime but instead I now have a TD ameritrade (5/5 stars) that I will use and promote. As well as anytime anyone talks stocks, I will be sure to give my thoughts on what this organization is lacking. Which is everything.

Dont believe me? I have references. Please refer to case ID numbers:
07270129, 07161212, 07042061 if whoever is reading this works here.

Dear Robinhood, F U for delaying my ability to move. Now you cause complications in my financial world and home life.

To anyone thinking of using robinhood and doing your own research: Dont do it. TD ameritrade has more information and more opportunities. While robinhood is essentially a scam. They want you to put money in but taking money out wont happen because they provide so many barriers and hurdles to jump over. 0/10< /text>

The glitch on Monday was a big big problem for user including me. Robinhood didn’t have any contingency or backup plan for their overload data problem. I watched my money keep sinking but I couldn’t do anything to stop it. You guys should take serious this matter because it already lost me as a customer and I am pretty sure that you guys will have a serious loss of customers.</text>

<review>Gross negligence from this company. Constantly has server issues, that they end up taking no responsibility for. This creates days were you will be unable to access your own account and your information which could cost you your portfolio. Please take your time to use another broker because this one, is more Sheriff of Nottingham than it is Robinhood.</review>< pictures>

Due to this it is hard to communicate and get things done promptly when system problems and errors occur compared to having call support.

<review>I can't believe the only way to get money into a new account is by giving Robinhood my Bank account login and passwords.  It's one thing to ask for a routing number and account number.  No one to answer a questions either.  Maybe a short play when they get hacked and everyone loses their money in their bank accounts.< /review>< pictures>

App was great till all my money (thousands of dollars) went missing from my account and its been over a week and a half and still no response from customer service...

Update: After over 3 weeks, customer service got back to me and indicated I had two accounts with the same phone number which didn't make sense to me... But was able to retrieve all my money and continue to use the app... If you have problems with Robinhood customer service, expect to wait 3 weeks for their response.</review>

Horrible company whipped my brothers account clean. After I sent a recommendation to the app then I ask why they they restrict my account havent been able to pull my money out for weeks now. They ask for personal info like I been hacked or something  when all I asked was a question. Customer service sucks I recommend before you trade with a company make sure they have a number to contact before you start trading.< /Review>

Insanely impossible to reach anyone with the breath of life in their nostrils. This place only works by email and you’ll never interact with the same person over email more than once. And it’s extremely difficult to withdraw money. I don’t recommend it.< /text>

Great idea and nice mobile interface, BUT when it's time to get your money out, they have all sorts of reasons why you have to wait. This is not the case with other REPUTABLE brokerage firms.I have been waiting for MONTHS to get my money from this company and keep getting the run around as to why I cannot withdraw MY money. Robinhood is quick to accept your money and execute your orders,  but when it comes time to disburse your gains there seems to be multiple reasons why you have to wait. What good is MY money if it can't be withdrawn!  TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!<//review>

This is a place for small investment with little money where commission fee matters, however if you are long term and potential known to the world of investment then choose a farm which has knowledge of investment even though they charge a fee which you rest assured a good night sleep while your money is working for you. The other important thing which I noticed also the customer service is really poor and email communication with service doesn't matter where the world is going to be more real time across different channels. If you are a new investor research much without watching youtube videos on these farms which is not accurate and flawed review, and read reviews from real customers.</Text>

No one will help you in customer support. I have been trying to contact them for weeks. My account is restricted and has my money in it. I have called the support phone number to have an automated message direct me to fill out a support ticket; however, no one will respond. I loved this app until this incident.</Review>

Robinhood is a small discount broker offering you free trades for self-directed accounts that appeal to people looking for financial independence.

Haven't tried withdrawing my money yet and while the holding period is a little unnerving its to be expected from a free app that manages such large volumes of money. Don't know why people are whining about customer service, if you want a personal broker that caters to your every specific need this app isn't for you.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Did a password reset this morning and when i tried logging back into my account its giving me a message that my account has been closed and shows 0$ in my account. I should have significant amount in my account and been trying to reach them for the past 30 min over the phone without any luck. Dropped a mail as well and no response yet for an hour now.  Better off paying transaction fee and get a good service than risk your money< /Text>

<date>1517382254562< /date><Review>Unreal. Robinhood doesn't answer the phone. It's been 10 business days since I asked Robinhood make a minor update to my account so I can move stocks into my account to sell. Even though I provided them all the info they requested, Robinhood has not fixed the problem. So, -- Not only has the stock price kept falling during this time, but a). their phone system directs you to email them only (though, 10 days ago, they were  answering the phone all day; so it seems when they get overwhelmed, (apparently the case for the last 9 business days), a recorded message tells you to email them your problem and hangs up, -- which is a dangerous position to be in as an investor -- ie, not knowing if they are there to answer the damn phone or not) , and b). they have not responded to the 8 emails I have sent them on this matter -- at all. I bought an android specifically TO trade on Robinhood. I thought it would pay for itself in what l'd avoid in fees. No. Not true. Because I can't get these stocks into my Robinhood account, I have now, by no fault of my own, LOST money. What happens if, for some innocuous reason, like you cut your finger and the fingerprint sign-in doesn't work, and you get locked out of your account, and the stock market is either price-peaking or "correcting," and you can't sell like you want to, and Robinhood won't answer the damn phone?  Even if it hurts, I'm gonna pay the 5 bucks per trade elsewhere not to be messed with like this...</Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>This place opened up an Account in my name without my permission so BEWARE!!! I inquired about setting up a new account in November 2017, but never heard back from anyone at Robinhood other than an automated email response saying they were looking into my inquiry. Weeks and weeks passed, so my interest discontinued. Obviously, Robinhood's desire to create "new customers" did not and my broker/dealer firm received a duplicate statement of my Account Summary in February 2019 showing a ZERO ($0.00) balance. 1) I never gave permission to open my account after my initial inquiry 2) Customer Service is HORRENDOUS and you cannot actually reach a human being at Robinhood 3) I told Robinhood to forget about setting up a new account as I was disappointed with their lack of customer service and timelines 4) Robinhood sent my broker/dealer firm a copy of my "Account Summary" a full year later, but did not even send anything to me...no email, no physically statement letter in the mail, no phone call, nada!!! I couldn't even imagine pulling out money from them if I wanted to, but I've heard that's painstaking in itself as well.

Btw, after this debacle, I went to an established platform, and E-trade has been pleasant and a breeze to work with.< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating>< user_id>

<review>Hope i could give the negative ratings to this Orgnization. This is not brokerage free App but they are making money with buggy products. You'll ended up losing more money then you pay the brokerage for each transaction to a well known Broker. you won't be able to sell your stock because they lock your account when you are in gain and sell your stock on your behalf. Once the stock comes down and you lost your money they unlock your account and do update from backend. They mashed up my account and i lost $5500 because they locked my account and i could not sell my stocks when i was in $2000 + gain. Worst customer service. They have only email support and their seniors doesn't know simple math calculations. I have filed the complain with FINRA and SEC against them.</review></record>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Worst customer support ever. Here is my experience. Some background first: my banker wants my Robinhood statements for recent two months. I opened my phone found that Robinhood dismissed the recent two statements because I had no trading history during that two months. So I sent emails to their customer support and directly request recent two months' statements. After verification, I got a nice email suggesting me to upgrade my app version. Clearly he misunderstood the problem. Then I told him the background and attached the screenshot. He understood the problem but continuously refusing to generate the recent two statements . After over a week back and forth emailing, I still don't get any statements. Robinhood your customer service succesfully won a star... And if you want to see a statement urgently, make sure you sell or buy in advance.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

When I pull my money out, it comes out. When I need clarification on something, I get a prompt response. I love this app.

<name>Sai Challa<//name><time>1515022559854< /time><Pics>None</Pics><Review>I only write this review with the intent that someone at Robinhood will monitor these reviews and fix the issues.

To be fair the app is brilliant but how could you possible have a trading platform without live customer service. Unacceptable. Long wait times on the phone and the call never connect. Even if they did they drop and no call back. You can only call them during market hours which is crazy considering they have extended market hours trading. Also the replies to tickets on emails are very slow.
1/5 for service.</Review></record>

Having trouble purchasing a stock, unable to retrieve from the app, sent a couple of emails no response.  I am now on hold with customer service.  Other than that I find the services to be excellent.............Please answer my email and correct the problem!<//Review>

BEWARE!!! Never use this app, once you put the money in your account it's nearly impossible to withdraw. I've contacted support and have not heard anything back but have been trying to withdraw my money for weeks now oh biting by all the stipulations and I still can't withdraw. This is a huge scam!!!!< /Review>

They are not responding to my daily emails.  They do not answer the phone.  I am currently on hold and have been for nearly a half hour.  I am more then infuriated.</Review>< pics>

This place is a nightmare. I opened an account with my students as a way to get then understanding the stock market and also for a way for them to pay for their senior trip. Well I have emailed them more than 10 times to their so called " contact us " on their site which i have never received a reply and I have had the joy of sitting on hold for over an hour on 4 different occasions.  What a joke and the only lesson the kids learned is that DTA. Don't Trust Anyone.  I am in the process of file a complaint with the SEC and the state along with reporting them to every news channel in the bay area.  And if anyone working there has the damn balls to answer , I would love to challenge your business ethics on live TV< /Review>

I've been using the app for about 9 months now and it's not bad. If you are looking to day trade they will enforce the 25k minimum as required by law. Look at Ustocktrade for unregulated day trading below the 25k limit. Overall I like RH well enough to keep using it for part of my portfolio. They limit themselves in some fairly basic brokerage functions such as not having trailing stop losses, not having bracket orders,  and not being able to set specific alerts for individual stocks. Shorting, call options, put options, etc. should be added. They could really open themselves up to the larger trading community if they added some of the above mentioned items.< /Text>

<review>Horrible company. I created an account and was told the process was completed until I added money to my robinhood wallet, then they tell me my application is under review and that I can’t touch my money until that is done, even if I want to put it back into my bank account they wouldn’t let me. So I waited the “maximum of 5 trading days” they said it would take and when my account was still under review I sent them an email. It took them 2 weeks to reply to my email, then they told me they closed my account due to “compliance issues” they said I didn’t send them the information that they asked me to when in fact I did, I searched all emails and had been on the app every day for a month and no further information was required. Now I go back to the app and it still says money transfer pending and I can’t touch my money or I will be fined. I’m surprised this app isn’t listed as a scam. Horrible horrible company and horrible customer service. I didn’t even try calling because people have said they’ve been left on hold all day then hung up on.

They have functionality issue with the features , and they did not accepted their issue and refunded back to customer!
Even though user has 25K still , they are not allowing to place stop loss on the same day and its kind of sucks !<//text>

Great place to sit and enjoy the views of Benicia or the Carquinez Straits. A paved Jedi leads to a pier where most everyday, fisherman can be seen fishing for sturgeon and striped bass< /Text>

We watched kite surfers doing their thing here. Very relaxing and entertaining. Parking is plentiful, easy and free. Bring a sweater even in summer.< /Review>

What a great location to hang out! Safe to be here long into the night and it's adjacent to downtown Benicia so if you're out try taking a walk down to the point and take in the breeze :) Sometimes you can even hear seals.< /Text>

I advise against purchasing anything from this company unless you are interested in terrible product development, awful customer relations, and the worst communications. Cali Raised Off Road is entirely unprofessional and can't seem to engineer parts to save themselves. Long story short, we ordered a bed rack system off their website, and ordered the associated parts that were advertised on their website to work with their system. The parts manufactured by Cali Raised were not compatible, and we have gone through multiple renditions with the Cali Raised product and sales teams. We have wasted hours of our time trying to get functioning products via repeated attempts to reach via email and phone. We have had to cancel trips because of the deficiencies of Cali Raised products and the company. 7 months later we are still waiting on a solution from Cali Raised. Would give zero stars if possible.< /review>

Great products! I got some sliders for my tundra which are high quality and fit great.  The reason i took off a star was because i had to go back a second time since when I first went to pick them up, there was alot of damage on the rhino lining that i got on the sliders.  This isnt necessarily their fault, but I feel like they should have inspected the product when they got it back from coating and had them redo it.  I noticed the damage when i was loading them onto my truck.  It was a hassle going back a second time and waiting another 2 weeks.  They did offer to deliver the parts to me when they came back but unfortunately, they could only deliver it during a weekday super late at night, which wasnt going to work for me.  All in all it took over 2 months to get them after i ordered it, but I am super happy with them now.  Morgan was great to deal with.<//review>

Unfortunately my previous 5 star rating no longer applies. The 5 stars was actually my second update from my initial one star review. I have had to edit my review for this business 3 times now which is unprecedented for me.
So, I'll try and make the explanation of my experience as brief as possible.
To start. These guys do great work. They did an awesome job on my RAV4. I totally would use them again if it wasn't for one BIG issue. That issue being COMMUNICATION. I honestly can't think of anything more important when running a business. People have lives and schedules and this establishment lives in a world of one. They do not and will not pick up the phone, respond to an email or dare I say, give a callback. It's stressful and unnecessary to do that to a customer. Worst yet, when you do get ahold of someone they do not go above and beyond to help. I quote "yea, he's a busy guy" that's what I got. I have emailed the owner pleading for help and he doesn't even respond.
To me, these are huge red flags. And unless you are dropping some serious $$$$ here. You probably will be met with much of the same. I can attest to all of this because it took them 6 months to install a pair of fog lights and ditch lights. They look fantastic but I wouldn't do it again. There have got to be other similar business that would be happy to take in a customer.

If you decide to go with CaliRaised my advice is to brace yourself for the long haul.

God speed to you.</Text>

I recently had a great experience with Cali Raised Off-Road. I broke one of the Bilstein 5100s on my 4Runner. The shock is practically impossible to find right now. Called Cali Raised and they checked and verified they had a couple in stock. They were very nice. We completed a simple transaction that integrated the use of email and their online ordering system while I was on the phone. Had the shock in Utah and installed in three days. Great job Cali Raised!</Review>

Went there this week for the first time and was impressed by their wide selection of inventory and top brand merchandise. Got to give a personal shout out to Morgan who took good care of me and even found me a pair of stock 4Runner cross bars for my rack at an awesome price. Hope you guys enjoyed the Pacifico beer. I will be shopping with them again in the future very soon when I start the build up on my 4runner.</review>

One thing to keep in mind if you're going to do business with this company. I SUGGEST YOU DONT!!!!!

I spent thousands here and their customer service is horrible.  Once they have your money they don't care about you.  They don't return phone calls. If you have an issue you're on your own.  I mean their prices are higher than most but they do have some cool stuff.   Again, their customer service is horrible.   Good luck<//Text>

Brought my truck here, after getting done from a shop in Pomona, found out that i was close to getting into an accident. They didnt tighten the screws and put the wrong springs.

These guys tool care of everything!
The owner and Jose took the time to explain everything.

Morgan was AWSOME too!

I am already taking my other Toyota so they may do all the suspension!

They email me
They call me before they do something they didnt mention.

These guys are really kool!</Review>

<Review>First and foremost I'd like to thank the Cali Raised staff for being so helpful and professional. I myself work in the automotive industry and all to often I've dealt with vendors/installers who really don't give a sh*t after you hand over the money. The staff at Cali Raised has gone above and beyond the call of duty for me on multiple occasions to correct any issues I had with the items I've purchased from them. I especially like to thank Morgan who has taken the time out of his evenings to personally hand deliver parts that were missing from the boxes of parts I picked up. Morgan, twice now has made the 4 hour round trip to make sure I've had everything I need to finish the installs of the items I ordered. He's the real MVP and the dude deserves a raise for the efforts he put forth to maintain the excellent customer service Cali Raised provides. I will continue to purchase my offroad and overlanding equipment from them in the future. Morgan, Jake, Jessica, and John, thank you for everything, you guys provide a great product and excellent service!!!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Excellent customer service!  I called and spoke with JC, while many companies out there are pushing the customer to some online, phone labyrinth of "please press 1 for customer service", these guys just picked up the phone and talked me through what i needed and got me what I was looking for.  JC spent the time needed to make sure everything was done right, emailing me a written copy of part numbers, easy to pay, just click the link.  JC even sent me a photo of my purchase being picked up by UPS.  Thanks again JC for my new 2.5 Fox shocks and Element UCAs!< /Text>

My experience was that it's a very unprofessional business. During my first visit I had to witness the manager berating one of the employees in front of all their employees and customers. It was very uncomfortable. So much so, my girlfriend nearly had an anxiety attack.

Yes, I got the items I ordered but, after spending $3,500 with them, you'd think they could throw in a free installation. Nope. They wanted an additional $300 to install a bolt on unit with a total of 20 bolts. A half hour job at best (I did it myself in 90 mins). Of course they had plenty of excuses as to why they need to charge including having to have the people set aside to do it. when I picked up the items half their staff was just goofing off.

To make things worse, they were so disorganized they couldn't remember which building they put my items in. They didn't even keep them together they're all in separate buildings. I was there for over an hour while they searched their buildings for my items.

My bottom line, if you can get your parts elsewhere do so.< /text>

Wow! I am beyond impressed. As an immigrant from Russia I must say - this is a real American business! Highly knowledgeable, down to earth crew who goes above and beyond for their customers. You definitely don't see a lot of that in SoCal. Almost everyone is out to rip you off because the demand is so high. But not the guys at Cali Raised Offroad.

I purchased their super awesome NSV knight rider LED bar for my Tundra. Shipping was fast. After I installed the bar myself, I started having a few electrical issues. I did everything correct and the product is great. The problem is Toyota likes to randomly change their wiring every year so the recent change wasn't working well with my new light bar.

I called up Cali Raised and they told me to bring it in. Even though they were an hour away, they were the only ones who said they can take care of the problem the same day. Other places wanted me to wait at least a week.

Morgan helped me out and he took care of all the issues in under an hour!! He repinned the headlight connectors and switched out the burned fuses. On top of that, Cali Raised didn't want to charge me anything since I bought the light from them.

During these tough times, I was not expecting such excellent service. A huge THANK YOU to Morgan and Cali Raised Offroad for helping me out. I will come to you with all of my off roading needs from now on.<//Review>

Family owned and operated business, customer service and attention to detail is extremely important to these guys. They are very meticulous with their work, which is so nice to see and I know my money is well spent. Not only are they very friendly but they are also very knowledgeable about the products they recommend and install for you. They also carry a lot of name brands and they just received a bunch of Prinsu racks, and Baja Design’s lights in their inventory, so I had options to chose from.

If you don’t have the opportunity to drop your car off and need to wait, they have a very nice waiting room with snacks, chairs, couch and a TV w/ Netflix.

I would recommend these guys to anyone and I’ll definitely be returning to have my next project install done by Cali Raised Off-Road.

Thanks again guys!< /Review>< Pics>

If you're worried about COVID, do not go here. Owners Randy and Jake don't require any of their staff members or customers to wear a mask. No signage around, nothing. Even if you as the customer wear one, these guys won't be while working in and around your vehicle. I stopped by a few days ago and went upstairs to the showroom to find a bunch of mask-less employees and customers, and walked right out.

Guess i'll wait a few more months before trying again.

PS: If you guys at Cali Raised read this, it might also be a good idea for you to wait until the end of the day to start drilling and building things UPSTAIRS in the middle of the show floor while the phones are going off with no one able to answer them.<//review>

So I had a Bumper, winch, and lights installed here.  Very clean work.  Morgan helped me out and he is a great resource if you need advice on what to do with your truck.  He is very deatal oriented and got the truck exactly like I wanted.  Overall a great experience at Cali Raised.< /Text>

Awsome staff. Purchased ditch lights with a lower bumper light bar and the whole kit. Had a trip planned and wanted an expedited installation. Without hesitation, they squeezed my truck in and made it happen. They were helpful in reviewing the parts needed and explained everything that was going to be done prior to installation. Definitely returning for all my off-road and overlanding needs. Will be recommending them to everyone I know.<//Review>

The customer service is practically non-existent. No one answers emails, they don't really seem to understand how their own business works, and when you call to ask questions and spend considerable money they hang up on you.<//text>

< Review>
This place is amazing!! Very nice and knowledgeable people working there. Alex and Morgan helped me with adding the ditch lights to my vehicle. They were very meticulous with my vehicle and wanted me to be aware of any issues with the area that they were working with. They also wanted me to know that the brackets that I supplied may scuff the paint a bit but Mikey was able to add some padding and make it better. The waiting area is very nice they have Netflix and free WiFi.  I can't say enough good things about the service and knowledge this shop has. I will definitely be coming back to here for all my vehicle needs and mods. Thanks again guys.< /Review>

<review>These guys are unprofessional when it comes to getting back to you whether it’s email or DM through Instagram. They read it, don’t reply, and when they do respond, they say they’ll get back to you and never do. I follow up again and simply don’t get a response but do see that they read it.

This place has worst customer service when it comes to question about product or follow up for shipping status. Everything online shows products available until you purchase and have to wait months before it is even shipped or someone to follow up with. Sent emails and no response, if this was the case from the beginning I’d much rather order from someone else and have products by now. Seems once they take your money you don’t matter anymore.< /Review>

<Review>Had a Cali raised light bar for about a year, and I worked great. Suddenly I noticed a little bit of fog in the lens and so I email them asking if there is a way to defog it. They told me to not worry about it, and they will send me a brand new light bar! Great products and even better customer service. 10/10 recommend!< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
I was extremely impressed with Cali Raised Led's  products and customer service. I called before placing my order about some questions I had about install. Jake who helped me out on the phone was super helpful and professional and walked me through the process. It made it way easier ordering knowing that I could call and get a real answer. After getting my bumper light bar for my Tacoma I can say I made the right choice. That thing is BRIGHT!< /Review>

These guys have the best pricing anywhere in the Los Angeles area. It honestly a cool feeling knowing the quality of the products is comparable to a big brand like RIGID but without the huge price tag. ALSO, they are very fair with their labor/ installation prices. They hooked me up with a lower light bar on my Tundra TRD PRO. I’m super impressed!!< /Text>

<date>1547589756527< /date><rating>2</rating><Review>Bought the side projecting ditch lights with brackets and wiring. Was pretty stoked when I bought them, heard good things about their products. Now over a week after I paid for them they still haven't shipped.  I emailed them and asked where they were a week after purchasing, I got a really fast reply saying they would go out the next day. 4 Days later now and nothing but a printed shipping label. Seems they have decent customer service but I'm bummed it's taking so long to get my lights. Hopefully they are worth the wait.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Excellent service & products! I ordered the 32" LED Light Bar, Brackets & Tacoma OEM Swtich. Being in Southern Cali, shipping was quick. Packing was good with no items missing or damaged and I followed the install video which took me about an hour to install.
Tip for installation!  Be careful of all fins on the radiator/oil cooler/etc.
You don't want to bend them!
The 5D LED light bar is brighter than other LED bars I've had that came from overseas!  I highly recommend Cali Raised LED and their products!<//review><Rating>5<//Rating><pics>None< /pics>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I had ordered the side shooter pods along with their ditch light brackets on top of bumper brackets and a 32inch light bar. So I spent some money with them.  Shipping was pretty prompt however when I installed my products, one of my side shooter pods didn’t work no matter what. I called customer service and they basically told me it was my problem. Needless to say I will never spend a dime there nor recommend them to anyone. I steer people very clear from them. That’s part of the reason rigid is so expensive because their product works along with a lifetime warranty and great customer service.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Products are decent but their customer service is pretty poor.  They sent me a random YouTube video for how to adapt their wiring harness to a four pin illuminated switch for my ditch lights.  When I informed them that the switch wasn’t working correctly they blamed me for using a switch they didn’t sell (the only reason I had to buy a switch they didn’t sell is because they had advertised that a Tacoma switch would fit in a 4Runner, but it doesn’t on 2016 models).  I eventually figured out their ground and hot wires from the relay were swapped (and different from another one of their products - which was wired correctly).  I politely informed them that this wad the issue and they seemed unconcerned that they were selling defective products.   Then I see a video bragging about how their low profile ditch light brackets were better than inferior competitors (and better then the non high profile brackets they already sold me).  There are plenty of better run operations out there.  Don’t waste your time with these guys.</Review>

<Response>{'time': 1523154467494, 'text': 'Hello Andrew,\n\nIt sounds like you were sent the video on how to install a 4 pin switch to our 3 pin harness. In no way do we ever "Blame" Customers. It sounds like you were using an item we didn\'t sell so we may not be able to give instructions for it as we are not familiar with the other companies product to provide you with an accurate description. As far is the ditch mounts we are always improving our products and coming out with a new generation items and upgrades just like every other company. Just as when you buy a vehicle next year the newer model comes out with upgrades the previous years do not have we do the same thing as we are constantly evolving and upgrading. If you have any issues feel free to give us a call at 714-752-6315 and we would love to find a solution. I will have one of our customer service reps contact you Monday as well to touch base!

<Text>TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCTS!
Get your gear from somewhere else.. ANYWHERE else!
Paid $30 for shipping took a month for me to receive my light bar. Sent 2 emails.. no response as I waited. Finally called them, shipment got lost. they agreed to send another set out with a 50% discount off shipping? Really? Still didnt get a penny back. Made me wait 30 days for my light ... Bad business. BTW.. Nothing special about the light. Just another Chinese made product with a boosted  “caliraised” price. Not high quality. Not impressed. Included a cheap harness connected to a silly ON-OFF switch. OEM switch NOT included. No support or instructions from these fools. They told me to watch a youtube video, sent me a url of a video showing me how to remove the front bumper cover and totally remove and not reinstall factory air dams. Instead use their single bolt bracket that isn't sturdy at all. The video does not cover wiring your lights. I guess it wasn’t important to show that part. Do some research... there are thorough videos out there that are very detailed in the installation process. I thought Caliraised was reputable but I was wrong. Low quality parts with NO support. What a headache!

Look at other company’s such as Rago Fabrication for mounts and amazon for the light bar and harness. You will save money and be happy with fast shipping and awesome customer service. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY! I really wish I could return this thing but i refuse to spend another penny on return shipping. Not paying these guys another cent.</Text></record>

My review is identical to Kevin Taff’s below.

I ordered a set of fog lights a few months back and I loved the product and the service.     Very quick shipping and the appropriate amount of communication.

This experience is the exact opposite.   I placed the order on 1/6/19(Sunday). I received a prompt email confirmation as well as a thank you for your order from Blake.

So far so good I’m thinkin.  I waited until Friday to inquire as to when the product was going to ship.  Blake responded stating that they are going out today (Friday 1/11).  A similar automated email was sent saying they’ve been shipped, that contained the tracking number.

I’ve been tracking them for 4 days now and ups has yet to receive the package.  I sent another email( Monday 1/14)asking when they were going to picked up. At 12:00 mst 1/15 I still didn’t receive an email.

I decided to call them and figure out what’s going on, I was told by the woman that they just received the side projecting lights and they would be leaving today.   She didn’t know why Blake told me they were shipping Friday.

I am always open to waiting a reasonable amount of time IF the delay is communicated.   I think it’s especially frustrating having the feeling that I was deceived to avoid confrontation.

My initial purchase months ago was great, but this one is definitely leaving a bad taste in my mouth.   With so many competitors, I doubt I will buying anything else from this company.   I can’t make any positive recommendations either.

It’s surprising to see the owners comments on the review below.  Good products cannot make up for poor customer service.< /review>

And a day or so before i get messages saying if i dont pickup now they are going to return em and then ill have to get another prescription from my provider….. but its always the same on the 19th….

< Review>
Horrible experience. Management was completely rude and showed no lack of compassion. Came to pick up a DoorDash delivery, and then realized I accidentally locked my keys inside my car. Went inside and told staff that I was picking up a delivery, but locked myself out, and if there was a tool to assist getting back in my car. She had to ask her managers and they without a second of thinking said no and went on with their day. This was right before Walgreens closed, and they closed up with me outside trying to figure out how to get into my car, like they had no care in the world. I didn’t expect them to stay outside with me til I had help, but they could’ve at least looked or thought for a second before pushing out a customer who was in need. You would think the manager would at least have the decency and offer to walk me over the tool aisle and see if there was anything that would help me and bring revenue to their store since I would be purchasing, but they showed no human decency or care. Thank you to the lady at the front register for trying to offer her help by asking. My complaint is directed to her managers who didn’t even offer to look or care.< /Review>

Giving one star is too much. This has to be the worst Walgreens I have ever been too. I called in advance to see if they can offer my son that has epilepsy an emergency dosage for my son. I have one great insurance two I would pay whatever it took to just get it. I called to make sure they can give me an emergency dosage for them to tell “yes we have one ready just come down and later you can pick up the prescription” I get there 30 min after and they tell me that they can’t give it to me and i will just have to wait till it gets approval. Like how can you tell someone to come by when you did your research for the patient insurance and everything to then have me wait a whole hour to get my sons medication. Oh and by the way they couldn’t even give him the dosage I went for I had to wait for the whole prescription. My point is you can’t falsely tell someone something and do something else. This is my last time I EVER step in Walgreens.. I rather just go to RiteAid CVS or anywhere else but Walgreens. WORST PLACE TO GO!!! Btw the woman who told me yes stop by was I believe Cynthia<//text>

One of the worst pharmacies I've ever been to. It's not all the staff's fault as they are always understaffed. Has never taken me less than 25 minutes to pick up a prescription after it's ready... 2 of 5 times I've picked up here, they couldn't find my prescription because it was in the completely wrong bin. Staff aren't very friendly, but may just be an indication of workload. Switching pharmacies.

I had originally given them 2/5 stars. Then after a 25 minute wait to drop off a prescription, and the tech checking the computer and inputting the script, I was told that it would be ready in the morning. I came back, waited 15 minutes, and was told it was a special order item and it would be at least tomorrow. It should not take hours and multiple trips to get medications.</review>

We tried using the curbside pickup. After waiting in the car more than 30 minutes we decided to call. I told the associate we had checked in. She put me on hold for 10 minutes. We went inside and were ignored. We left without our items.< /review>

Called to ask when they might get a shipment in of disinfectant agents and the store clerk named Jennifer said "we don't disclose that information" . She was so rude and needs to take a class on customer service. When I called RITE AID the associate was very polite.  If I could give WALGREENS no stars I would.</review>

Absolutely horrible. I have never received so many excuses for medications not being ready. This is a consistent issue, despite me receiving confirmation that they are in fact ready. Too often they have run out of medications and I'm forced to accept a partial refill. I hope you have time too, because they are incredibly slow. Just terrible.<//Text>

<text>Like most all reviews this Walgreens is completely useless. The manager doesn't seem to care though some of the employees other than the manager in the pharmacy are caring. The wait times both inside the store or the drive thru are completely inefficient and slow.
How does Corporate not take corrective action? Maybe it's like PG&E....the worse the results the bigger the pay/bonuses?

<Text>There is NEVER enough people working in Pharmacy! I can't believe how long I have to wait. They used to have someone dedicated to the drive-thru and someone dedicated to the counter, but no more! I am the seventh car, have been here for ten minutes, and haven't moved forward yet. I guess they aren't making enough money on their expensive drugs to hire more help.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp><user_name>valligator1</user_name>< time>

<rating>1<//rating><text>I don't know about Walgreens as a company, but Walgreens Manteca has to be the worst pharmacy in the county. Untrained, unprofessional staff. Never enough people behind the counter. Only two staff on weekends, so they close for lunch during the middle of day, doesn't matter if your already waiting in line, your out of luck. Tell you they have contacted your Doctors office to renew a prescription, a week later the doctor never heard from them and says Walgreens is known for that.
I gave them 1 star because I had to, should be negative 10. Will not shop here again.<//text>< Pictures>

this place has the most god awful pharmacy! Plus the staff running the pharmacy take their sweet time. I’m going to be switching pharmacies because the lines and wait times are getting way too out of hand. I only take one medication, every time I drop it off, they give me some impossible time of when  it will be ready. I call back hours later to check and they still haven’t got it ready. This has happened multiple times. Whether you go stand in line or drive-thru please don’t waste your time here. Change pharmacies.< /text>

<Name>Kelly Gray</Name><Text>Is this the worst pharmacy in North America? I don’t know, but it’s definitely the worst in Manteca.  Every time I come here, it is a worse experience.  The desk folks can never find my info, they always forget to tell me something crucial about my prescription, and the wait is minimum 30 minutes even when nobody else is here because...I don’t know.  I can’t imagine how you run something so poorly.  Today was the final straw, moving all my business to the local pharmacy immediately and hope I never have to set foot in this chasm of ineptitude again.< /Text>< Rate>

<Review>I was having a hard time with Costco and my insurance card. Walgreen was able to figure it out immediately. However, they told me my insurance didn't cover the meds and with would be over $500. I asked the tech if there was a generic they could fill, and he said no. Moments later my doctor called in the generic that they "didn't have" and had my script filled within minutes. The staff were very pleasant but possibly just need more time and training in the field.<//Review>< Pics>

They never have your prescription ready guess they have a drive-thru that you have to wait behind four cars or you can go inside and stand in line for an hour. I don't recommend going here to anybody< /text>

<text>The only reason I shopped here was the convenience,  sure not the prices. With the move to closing at 10:00 PM, It is no longer convenient. The night manager isn't always very friendly, either. Thankfully, the rest of the staff has been.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80904034ca41165f:0x498a31a5e9f973a7<//GmapID></record>

SUMARI, The cashier who works here should never be let to work as a retail associate anywhere. My girlfriend went here this morning to buy a toothache reliever for me and paid it by cash. She gave this associate a $100 bill and she made my girlfriend stand there for 25 minutes because she presumed its a counterfeit. While I understand it is essential to ensure the legality of the tender, it is not acceptable that an employee who is untrained given the position to do this. The manager had to come and apologize for the whole commotion all the while I was suffering with terrible pain at home waiting for the medicine. Untrained, unprofessional and profiling my girlfriend because of her race? . We rarely encounter someone who is a minority being racist to another minority and this woman is an Epitome of that margin. NEVER visiting the store again. NEVER!<//Review>

They are supposed to be a Fed Ex pickup location but since the manager was at lunch, no one else was available to accept packages from the FedEx driver. ?  Shouldn't someone always be available if you're a pickup location?
Now my package will be late<//text>

Personal Review of Dr. Cuevas' suggestion for the upgrade:

Walgreens:
Healthy Community Club ---
A place for patients to receive benefits as card-club membership holders of specialty pharmacy, and also a high-end market that serves individuals who may also have convenience store needs for alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, and phone accessories.

Walgreens is not only a Community Market that provides photography film printing services, and also provides to our public community things like sexual safety & pregnancy prevention products like "Plan B, lubricated condoms, and also feminine products like: pads & tampons, we also provide clinic services outside of our compound pharmacy assistance that is available pretty much 24-7! In all minuette cities.

"Perhaps Walgreens should invest in an upgrade in staff with this reccomendation of review for the public. Security should be the mindset of Walgreens' Pharmacy for the coming future. Considering their ability to grow in expanse and stay in growth rate without a drop into the future & beyond." -Christen<//text>

When you get to the drive thru, you will wait to have a bit. The staff will say one moment please maybe one to two times, but eventually they are trying their best to get to you.< /Review>

Long wait in line at the pharmacy. And everyone seem to be getting turned around saying that their prescriptions were not ready. I've heard many saying they've waited 2 hours and 3 hours.<//review>

I got some adobada tacos here last night, they were cold, the meat didn’t taste like anything and the tortillas were nasty. Oh by the way I paid $12 something for 4 tacos! I wouldn’t care that the food was overpriced if it was decent but it wasn’t. If you want some good Mexican food go to burritos Santana, it’s in Winchester too.< /Text>

<Review>The Primos at Winchester and Murrieta Hot Springs Rd. We visit this evening around 8pm. My order was simple, you would think. Nachos! They tasted like "Nachos from Stale" Chips, meat, and beans. All stale. The cook was talking about his work hours  being reduced to the Cashier Woman when we walked in. A man was asleep in the first booth with has head face down on the table with no apparent food purchase.  Just asleep. Two other patrons waiting on their orders to go. Our other order wasn't any better. This is my first time at Primos in 5 years. It was a disappointment then and unfortunately a disappointment tonight.  So much for second chances.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2eG66efZRIZwluLTm-NGOwyoGeES9_0zYIKFs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVkh5ensw_IvCbNiGlxXZK9w2ZLMYpoT4phapd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

Waited for over 30 minutes to get the rest of the food 😴 and while waiting they are making other people's food that came in after I did. This location SUCKS also they should have more than 2 people working. This is BS.</review>< user_name>

<Text>Ordered food this morning, 2 chorizo burritos, an order of chilequiles and an order of huevos rancheros (with added egg shell). One of the burritos came with only egg, not an ounce of chorizo to be seen. Both orders of huevos rancheros and chilequiles only came with rice, not beans...which is strange.

We will not be eating at this location again as it seems everything we ordered had something wrong.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The carne asada burrito costs more than $ 10 and is 5 "to 6" inches large and you add the raw tortilla, waiting time too long.🥲🤣🤣😂< /Text>

I knew it was going to be a bad experience when I tried calling in my order and they wouldn't even pick up the phone. When they finally picked up the phone, I ordered a couple of street tacos with a side of beans. I made the mistake of sending my son to pick up my food. Turns out they gave me rice instead of beans. Mind you the side of rice was about 4 ounce- $3!! That's not even the bad part. I drove back to the store to get my side of beans. The girl that was mopping stopped cleaning and started warming up a side of beans without washing her hands- gross! 🤢 I took back the rice and I left. I stopped coming to this location because they always get my order wrong, they over cook my food & the employees lack common sense and courtesy. I will stick to the mall location with the drive through. However, they have all become ridiculously over priced!</Text>

A lady in her 30s or 40s, white complexion, heavier set, whom was supposed to be running the counter and was doing a poor job as we stood at an empty counter waiting to order when we got there and then again when asking for a to-go box. Lucky the cook saw me and went to pass me one. I took one step to the side of the counter to grab it from him and as I’m saying “Thank you man” I’m cut off with “I can’t have you back that far, you need to get back!” From the back In a unbelievably rude tone. Sorry lady, do your job so others don’t have to do it for you. Not my fault your 40 going home smelling like beans and guacamole. The cooks great tho. Foods always good.<//Text>< Pictures>

I stopped by here in the morning just close to lunch. They were pretty busy taking and making orders, so be prepared to wait a bit. They make food to order, but the quality is worth it. There is a salsa bar with Jalapeno and Habenero Salsa as well as Pico. You can munch on chips and salsa while waiting. Been here many times and the foid is always great!</review>

<review>I am not one of those reviewers who rate based off if of one experience. I have gone here occasionally throughout th3 years and I have never had a bad experience. If you think of it, many businesses in the area are franchises, and some are family owned. So we must be human first and realize that mistakes happen. Be a good neighbor and rate them honestly.

Tip: They have three different burritos with the word California in it. Be sure to double check that you order the correct one.

I really like the California breakfast burrito from here. I'd eat it any time of day. The rest of the food here seems pretty hit or miss, depending on the cooks in the kitchen. The people who work at the order counter could really use some training and some supervision. They do a lot of standing around, doing nothing when customers aren't ordering food.<//text>

Order the carne asada nachos for 9.95. Did not notice the 1.50 charge tip they snuck on there. So either they charge 1.50 for using a card or they decide to add their own tip to your bill. Called them and they just hung up on me. Will never go back again. Also telling all friends to avoid this place, they will just rip you off.</Review>

<text>Look, I’m generally pretty fair, but I am honestly regretting not going to del taco. So, I ordered the Cali breakfast burrito, no sour cream add beans. I got a Cali breakfast burrito WITH sour cream and NO beans. I asked for a custom order, it happens, no biggie. Ask them to fix it. Guy behind the grill throws a fit asking to see the receipt because he doesn’t believe it. So, once he realizes I’m right, (btw, this receipt interaction is happening loudly between the cashier girl and him in front of me and clearly upset at me), he goes ahead and adds the beans. But there’s still sour cream in the burrito. He wraps it up, slams it on the counter, cashier sees it and IGNORES it. Cook says nothing. Fuming, I walk out, but I don’t complain. I go sit around the corner with my wife and dog and start eating. She ordered quesadillas. So, both of our foods had eggs. These eggs were SO WET!! And the guy just POURED on the chipotle sauce or whatever it is on both of our meals and so they were just like an ocean inside. It was a really terrible feeling to bite into. Her quesadillas tortillas were still fresh out of the package seemingly. It fell apart and everything was just a mess.

To sum up, the staff could be better, the cook needs to be changed though for sure. Mid twenties, tall Spanish speaking dude. Around 5:50 pm. The food was terrible. I won’t be returning, but based on the fact the business has so many negative reviews both on FB and Yelp, I’d venture to say they don’t care. Maybe the day shift is better, but I will never find out. Biggest waste of $18 for a burrito, quesadilla, and a small drink I’ve ever made. This refers to the Los Primos off Hwy 79 N and Benton, next to the Del Taco that also sucks where I should have eaten instead.< /text><Rating>1</Rating>< user_name>

They couldn't get a potato taco right. Asked what was on it, and what I was told was completely different than what I got. Apparently after explaining that I'm allergic to eggs, they thought I meant some strange kind of european bird that didn't exist in the states. Half eggs, half potato. No lettuce, no cheese. I ask them, they quickly "fix"it and return with potato in a tortilla. Nothing else. I ask them to put lettuce and cheese on it. Finally! Then I bite into barely cooked potato.  Couldn't even eat it. Worst mexican experience ever</text>

Horrible service. The drive through cashier refused to give me the sauce I requested because they were running low ( this at 9pm long after the dinner rush). When I requested to purchase extra she refused and closed the drive through window on me.<//Text>

We ordered and paid for a full order of bacon chipotle fries and we were given a half order and they argued with us about the size. The amount was noticably different there was minimal amounts of chipotle sauce on it and bacon on the top once you really got in to it there was nothing but fries. Its the rudest service ive experienced there. I'm extremely disappointed with the food. The girl behind the counter was rude and distracted while helping us and the man that was there was rude as well. This place sucks now. It went down hill completely.

We are new to town and decided to try this place on Taco Tuesday night, I had 2 fish tacos and my husband had a Baja burrito. As soon as I ate my tacos I got instantly sick, had cramps and heartburn all night. This morning both my husband and I had horrendous diarrhea and camps. WON'T GO BACK AGAIN< /review>

<review>I just bought a cali burrito with guacamole. And I had to pay for the guac😏 It had No flavor! It had chunks of cooked tomatoe. When they said it has pico de gallo I thought it was fresh. No it wasn't! It was cooked😠 Then I asked for carrots. Omg! The carrots were so old, they tasted bad and were falling apart. I will never go there again.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

The best thing they had was the Albondigas Soup.. They got rid of it. I've eaten here a million times.. Their carne asada always sucks on their nachos & fries first of all & I Love Los Primos!!! Their bean & cheese burrito is killer & so is their chorizo breakfast burrito & monter breakfast burrito.. Why would they Ever get rid of their Albondigas?!!! Their Menudo is worst than the canned menudo & I actually love certain canned menudos... They should've gotten rid of tbeir menudo NOT the Albondigas, Smh. Get rid of the Los primos off of Winchester & whatever that mall street is in Temecula, Ca. It's not a good look when it comes to that taste. Put another 24hour fast food Mexican joint there that actually gives a damn... Former Temecula native - now from Los Angeles, Ca.</Text>

Are you kidding me with this place trying to pass as a food destination;
? This was the most over priced, crappy food I've ever had. They use the name "monster" in their food to make you think.its bigger than normal. It's NOT! They are chincy with meat and just so expensive for crap.<//Text>

< review>
The smallest burrito I've ever had and probably the most expensive. $7.69 is worth MUCH more. Not coming back.<//review>

<review>They messed up my order and when I went back get the order corrected the lady gave me back the burrito I returned, stating they got the order correct (they did not). She was a total b****. I asked for my money back. DO NOT EAT HERE!!! These people are horrible, and their fun is junk.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Rotts of Friends Animal Rescue is amazing. Rene took my call for help on her day off, to take on the sweetest Rottweiler Lucy, who was set up for a euthanasia appointment. Not an aggressive bone in her body. With the help of the Rescue we saved her life!!!<//review>

Renee is very good at matching the dogs with people. I have adopted 3 dogs from her and 2 of them became my service dog, and the pup I just got is currently being trained, and were perfect.< /text>

My family applied to adopt a Rottweiler at Rotts of Friends. Once our application was approved, we drove up to Woodland from the Bay Area to meet the pup we were interested in. We called ahead to confirm if we needed an appointment and to make sure it was ok to bring our dog to meet the possible new addition - we were told that no appointment was needed and to come by during open hours. We arrived at 10:15AM on 10/16 and called to let them know we were here (during Covid times). They informed us, EXTREMELY rudely, that we were late and needed to be there by 10AM and that they could not show us the dog. We explained that neither their website nor the staff we spoke to had mentioned a necessary time and that we had even asked about an appointment. The woman insisted we were wrong. We asked if we could have the two dogs meet and just come back to proceed with the adoption at a later date. We were very rudely told no and that the dog we were interested in could not go home with another dog. This was news to us as the website did not detail this behavior about the dog AND our application noted that we already have another dog at home (our application that was approved before we drove the 2.5 hours). She finally ended her tirade by telling us that even though we are experienced husky and pit bull owners (large/aggressive breeds), we had to be experienced with Rottweilers to adopt the dog we were interested in. We left and will NOT be seeking to adopt any dog from Rotts with Friends. We are very reasonable people and would have understood if our application had been denied for any of the above reasons, or even if we had arrived late and been told politely to come another time. It is a shame that this rescue is turning away kind, qualified and interested adopters in such an unprofessional manner.< /Text>

We drove 2.5 hours from Redding to try to adopt a Rottweiler and was met by the Rudest, most annoying and ridiculous owner of the facility you could ever imaging. While we were there another couple who drove 4 hours arrived at 10am also and were equally put off by this individual and were told to come back at another time. WOW after driving for hours. She made excuses for not showing us any dogs as she was too busy but did tell us we were great candidates for a Rotweillert . rescue. We have had several over the past 20 years and they were part of our family. DO NOT DRIVE OVER 10 MINUTES TO WASTE YOUR TIME DEALING WITH THE MONSTER AT THE KENNEL.</text>

<Text>Edit: A friend and I both adopted dogs from ROF a few years back. Their policy is that the dog's chip remains registered to ROF in case the owner isn't responsible about updating their information. I was annoyed but understood where she was coming from.
My friend's got loose, was found by a stranger, and scanned at a nearby clinic. The chip was UNREGISTERED. Thank goodness it's a small town and one of the vets recognized him. I brought in my dog and asked to have him scanned as a precaution and he was unregistered as well. Both are now properly registered to their rightful owners. If you adopted from them, please check your pets.

Renee means business. She asked lots of questions regarding my situation and history training dogs. I came in with a specific dog in mind but after I met him, she brought out a different dog that was a perfect fit for me. He's been a wonderful addition to the family. Rotts does wonderful work saving dogs that may otherwise have been put down.
I am very appreciative that she offers free training for the dogs adopted from her and went through the course. We found other methods that worked better for our dog's needs and personality, but it was a good start. Won't knock her for using methods that have consistently worked for her and many others.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Gmap_id>0x8084d903275b6c59:0x6cde7bad330b90d7</Gmap_id><review>A dear friend gave this Organization $1800 to find a home for a beloved shelter dog that was at risk of euthanasia. I worked with this dog several times and his well-being meant a lot to me and to many others that cared for him. We got no updates. We were rarely allowed to visit him . Renee would constantly have different stories for us. Not return our phone calls. Put us off, delay, and be evasive. She would not give us the courtesy of in-depth information on where he is or even a photo. We started to seriously doubt her story that he was adopted. I personally think he might be dead. This is a dangerous woman. She is a liar. . And she is aggressive. I don’t care how many dogs she has saved. We have no idea where Hot rod is,  she says we have no right to know since we signed him over. We gave $1800 and simply asked for the kindness to know with proof that he was in a home. After reading all of the negative reviews about this organization and going through this turmoil not knowing where this dog  – do not give your money to her!!
She has threatened to “ smear” The shelter where he came from. How dare her! Who acts like this?
This has been a very stressful situation for people that love this dog and only wanted to know for certain that he was in a loving home. We simply cannot believe her words because there are  many things she has told us that are out right lies.
Do not support this woman. I’ve never written a review like this ever in my life. I love animal rescue. All of my dogs are rescued
but this organization needs to be investigated!
I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and consumer affairs< /review>< pics>

<Review>We adopted both are Rotties From Rott’s of friends. We have had nothing but good experiences with both adoptions. But we are also responsible dog owners. I can’t imaging the horrible things they must see people doing too dogs.

Awesome place!  Be prepared to bring your whole family and other pets though - Renee is very thourough and won't let just anyone adopt her babies!  She places the animals based on the animal's personality and your questions. Also if your adoption doesn't work out, bring the pet back to Renee.<//text>

3 years ago I adopted the most amazing kind loving dog named Jesse only because Renee called me from Rotts of friends animal rescue and said she had a hound mix I’d like and since my 9 year old  Bluetick hound was losing her battle with ME condition I took the leap. It wasn’t easy I even tried returning Jesse I was hard but Renee knew what she was doing and gave me a talk to so I stuck it out and I’m
Glad and thankful to Renee. Jesse now has new additions to his family with my parents moving in and their dog Luna he is happy to have all the love and company.

Renee trained my Bluetick hound as well and I did her classes for sometime. There were all kinds of dogs in class even a pit bull with aggression issues and Renee handled all the dogs and owners well. She knows what she is doing. Some might call her rude but she matches the dogs to you just fine. She doesnt have time for people with attitude I get it I watched  her through the years spread thin having to put her foot down to get her own time but she always treats the animals great. They have grown to more kennels but the staff keeps the dogs happy. I almost adopted a hound s while  back that Renee rescue from
UCD animal testing or practicing not sure but it had heart surgery the dog was in great shape and she was finding it a forever  home. To the poster who said she gives dogs to animal testing he has it backwards as I remember the first dogs she rehomed  from the university. Renee is for the animals not so much the people so if you have sensitive skin don’t go there but if you do you will get the best dog fit for you. She has her rules for a reason.

My dog Jesse has been found hit by a car in farmland backroads and Renee has just had his back and hind surgery done. She pays for all this herself and always takes care of the dogs.

I worked with Jesse and got his leg working now he runs and plays without too much of a limp.

I also Kenneled  my sick Bluetick hound a couple times and they fed her in her special ME Bailey chair and gave her her meds and fluids she needed they went above and beyond.<//review>

I couldn’t speak more highly of Renee and Rotts of Friends. There seem to be a lot of judgemental people here trying to bring down a hardworking and caring woman and her rescue when they do not understand what goes in to animal rescue in the first place!! Here is why this woman rocks:
One afternoon I was driving with a friend and we took a wrong turn through farmland. We came across two German shepherds that looked lost so I pulled over. They were dirty, wet and stank. One of them looked pretty thin too so I wanted to grab them and take them to a vet. They had collars but no tags. We took them to a vet a few miles away who check them for a microchip. Both had chips but not registered to an owner - one of the dogs was rescued to Rotts of Friends. The vet called and Renee said she would take them in to find the owner. She was in the middle of a medical emergency so we were more than happy to drive the 20 minutes to the rescue. By this time the vet was closed and they hadn’t given us the chip number so we wouldn’t be able to find the owner info til Monday since it was a weekend. Renee was juggling her emergency as well as other things because staff had called in sick and STILL made time for the dogs. She was so grateful to us, offered to pay for gas but we were just glad to help.
The bottom line is she cares about the animals. She works in rescue which is one of the hardest things to do and people don’t seem to understand that. Before you bash someone’s passion and career think about being responsible, compassionate and understanding individuals first and foremost. Renee is a rock star!</Text>

What a strange rude woman.
We purchased a dog , a 4 month old shepherd mix on recommendations. Included was basic obedience training. My mother is 75 years old and wanted a dog for protection and company
Renee told my mother she would provide the training. Shortly after she decided
to stop the training. Several times she instructed my mother to come out for some training with the dog. Every time my mother was told to wait for at least a half hour before Renee could break away from her emergencies to provide training. This last time she walked away from us leaving us alone sitting in the car waiting.  After 40 minutes we decided to leave.
She had closed the gate behind us. I got out of my car to open the gate.  Renee. walks up to me and tells us we are trespassing. Rude words were exchanged and we left.  She obviously has too much on her plate. Stay away!<//review>

Extremely rude woman. Had an attitude with me the whole time. I asked if she had room to take in a rottweiler and she said they are full UNLESS I give them a "significant donation". Then suggested I have my dog euthanized at the vet, even though he is not sick, because I can't afford their donation fee.< /Text>

<user_name>Charles James</user_name><review>My Fiance and I wanted to rescue a dog after the unfortunate passing of our 13 year rot. This lady was rude right off the back because my fiance showed up a little early as to be ahead of the line. She was in her car and wasn't doing anything except waiting. Once inside she witnessed her yelling at not only other potential adoptees but to the staff as well. She introduced the dog eventuall and didn't inform her of this dogs tendencies. My fiance informed her I was working and would be home that evening. We followed the instructions this lady told us. We have now found that this dog is very male aggresive and is more of a one person dog. Which was never told to her. This dog is good one minute and lunging the next growling and trying to bite the next. When we called this morning to inform her the dog wasn't the right fit for our family as we have small nieces and nephews as well as neighbors who have children. This woman called my fiance dumb and obviously uneducated with dogs. Then proceeds to say she is to busy to take the dog back and we should just take it to the pound and have it euthanized.... worst customer service ever. My fiance got off the phone in tears. I am livid. Will never recommend this place and honestly will do whatever I can to make sure no one I know goes there. I feel bad for her employees as well as the animals there.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Completely disgusted with the way Renee handles her so called "safe haven". I cannot believe someone so rude could be entrusted to shelter and care for hurt and/or abandoned dogs. I would seriously think twice before putting a dog in her care. She did not start this organization to be there for these needy animals. She did it to con people into allowing her to make money on their misfortune. I personally am appalled by how she spoke with me when I called to answer a simple question. Her response was everything is on the website. Which it in fact was not. It is a shame someone like this has the opportunity to have a business like this. Completely disgusted and disappointed. Will not be recommending anyone to them ever!< /Review>< pictures>

We brought her home and started noticing problems right away. Then looking on their website.  They had her picture on their website as an example of what great things they do in dog rescue !!!  I saw her and she was the thinnest large dog I have ever seen in my life    I called Davis because I knew they had taken herthere.  I Heard one of the other people that work there say she had come from another rescue where someone had died and most of the dogs were found dead or half dead  I was not told about this when I adopted her I just heard other people talking and put two into together. after we got home to Santa Barbara. I were never told about this they said they found her wandering on the street.  The owner woman took several of those dogs and rehabilitated them so she thought. This dog had brain damage from Severe dehydration this dog should not have been   Rehabilitated.  Shortly after bringing her home we started realizing something was wrong  we saw wen someone walked in front of her she wasn’t able to tell if she should attack or not but she would lunch teeth showing mouth open it was scary , but she lunged at both of our grandkids who were able to get out of the way in the nick of time. she lunged at my ex-husband  We had to destroy Elke!  Because we knew if we returned her they would just adopt her out to someone else  and that someone else could’ve been badly injured,horrible situation.  I look them up again just to see if they were still in business I’m now sorry    I can’t remember the owners name but now that I know they’re still in business I plan on doing something about it   And if the owner is reading this you’ll be hearing from me shortly my name is Marcy not Karen<//Text>< Pictures>

I've had many negative experiences with businesses and never left a bad review but this one experience has topped it off for me I'm so disgusted by the owners attitude Renee Lancaster I came all the way from Roseville on a Saturday for adoption and she was so rude to me no concideration that I came an hour away to see the dog I wanted to adopt she basically yelled at me then started talking down on me it took me alot to not open my mouth and contain my self due to me being a Christian everytime I call she sais "I'm the middle of a dog bath"what do you want" I'm in the middle of church" and then hangs up I've had no way of being able to communicate I'm so upset and so irritated by this woman I'm amazed she's in business at this point everyone keeps leaving these horrible reviews on her so that pretty much tells you what your dealing with no one wants to deal with a rude person I've never met such a ghetto rude inconsiderate woman she has no manners and has no idea on how to conduct herself as a business best believe she will not last with her business venture im sure she's secretly breeding dogs before she nuters them I'm more than happy to hear about your experience with her I'm hoping she reads this and really thinks about how she conducts herself first dog I saw was laying on his poop I don't like to assume but I needed to write this this review.< /review>

Kalib was adopted Saturday 3/25/17. He is 4 months old & awesome! Rotts of Friends worked with each person to make sure each dog is the fit to their family. Thank you Renee</Review>

<Text>This lady was so rude and inconsiderate.  She answered the phone and asked "what do you want ,its Sunday and this is my personal line ." She proceeded to tell me to take my dog to the local pound and that she was busy." I wouldnt trust her to pick up dog poop let alone care for a living animal.<//Text>< UserId.>

My friend told me that the chicken teriyaki here was good so I came here with my mom to try it out for her birthday and we both absolutely loved it. The sliced beef pho and the chicken teriyaki were amazing and are a must try. Definitely coming here again. 100% recommended place.< /Review>

After reading all those positive reviews, I was sooo excited to have some decent pho in the valley. Well, truth be told, this was a major disappointment. Pho broth was sweeter than Tom Yum's and there wasn't that rich cinnamon-y, beefy aroma I was craving. I reheated the broth with a lot of lime, hoisin sauce, and sriracha, but the flavor was just not there. I was expecting a lot bc of their confident pricing of $13.95, but really, its quality wasn't even worth $6. It was hella food, but that wasn't the reason why four of us could not finish 2 orders of pho.

On the side, we ordered South Dakota roll, which was good, and spring rolls... which I do not want to believe that I paid 8 dollars on. They were more like loose noodle rolls, with rice noodles taking up 3/4 of the filling, along with a piece of lettuce, few pieces of mint leaves, tiny cucumber slices, and couple thin slices of meat and shrimp. I gulped one down as soon as I got home, but when I took a bite into the second one, I found out that the shrimp was not thoroughly cooked as shown in the picture. I checked that all the other pieces have RAW and GRAY shrimp slices so I ended up throwing all away.

For a pickup of 2 combo pho (w a piece of tripe, 3 quarters of meatball, well-done briskets, no rare beef, and hella bean sprouts, jalapenos, onions, cilantro, and mint/basil), a $10 roll, and 2 pieces of noodle rolls, the total came out to be ~$49, which can cover 3 reg size pho (w more tripe, rare beef, 2 meatballs), thicc greeny spring rolls, and 2 glasses of thai tea at the authentic pho restaurants!! Food prices are higher in store for this restaurant than on delivery apps, so the total will come out almost the same either way (There was only $5 difference in mine). Just noticed that the price shown on Yelp is lower than in store menu, too.

Restaurant itself doesn't deserve any star, so the lone star goes to Gabby, their hostess, for her beautiful hospitality and her knowledge on the menu. I'm sorry. I told you I'd tip you better next time, but it seems like there's no next time.< /Text>

This restaurant is my favorite. I eat in a lot of restaurants but to this place I keep coming back again and again. The crew is very warm and the food they offer is so tasty. I would always prefer to have a decent dinner in this place. I highly recommend this place.<//Review>

<review>Food is amazing! Had the beef bun/vermicelli with some spicy edamame. They have a nice selection of beer and a Freestyle soda fountain. Place looks nice with the lighting and sushi bar 5/5 will go again.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>One of my top places for quality pho. Entered near eleven, it wasn't packed. Next time I'll be back with my coworkers. Bring your appetite because portions are large. Reminds me of a place in New York I liked to visit.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I had seen this place a few months ago however they were not open for business yet.
I decided tonight would be a good night to have some hot pho 🍜 with it being pretty chilly outside.
When you walk in, you quickly realize the inside makes you forget what side of town you're in.
The portion sizes are good and the presentation is even better.
I had the combination pho bowl, it was delicious 😋. Spring Rolls were hefty.
Ordered a Virginia roll which was very good as well
We also ordered a Dinner Box, which had teriyaki chicken on a bed of veggies, white rice, tempura, 2 pieces of sushi 🍣 and cabbage salad. The Dinner Box also came with miso soup 🍲. The entire meal was very very good. The service was excellent (but we were there late, so we were the only ones there)
Pricing is a tad high, but typically this type of cuisine is.

Overall if I had to give a score 1 out of a 100, it gets an 85.
Grade wise, I'd give it a B+.

I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.

Wishing this new business MUCH SUCCESS!!< /Text>< Pics>

I used to be a OTR truck driver. And one of the restaurants I remember from my travels is this one! I would give anything to know how to cook the dish they served me. I hope this owners prosper and expand!<//Review>

Staff are friendly and benevolent contributing to a cool atmosphere. Even the cook came out of the back for a little & was interested in how we were enjoying our meal. In addition to the outstanding service they offer a special on sushi that includes two rolls for 9.99! Love this place!< /review>

I'm from a costal city. This is the best thing the valley has to offer for pho and sushi. It's basic sushi with some dressed up rolls. It's good for what it is. Don't go in expecting high class sushi bar. You're in a small town with plenty of people that aren't open to try new foods. It's a good place though.<//text>

The food is decent. The service very good. The location is ok but only if your looking for it. Had a decent size menu and good deals. The sushi is good, but sadly I cant say the same the other dishes. They put their own spin on certain recipes that dont work well.
If you want quick sushi, then yes, visit the location.
I would only go if I have a craving. I would not reccomend the location as a to go place for dinner.</text>

Great quality food for a reasonable price! The presentations are very fancy, and it's all very fresh and tasty. Good service and nice hospitality. There aren't many places around here with passionate chefs, so please give this restaurant a try! It's the best Asian restaurant I've been to here in the valley!< /Review>

I went to purchase chicken breast Bowl 7.95 the sign says outside the window also has different advertising on the windows on pricing as soon as you come in they tell you that the price he's not that that they cannot offer you that they can offer you something else and they tried to sell you something else which is $12 is $13 more expensive so I say it's false advertising if it's Shady like this right now what do you expect later</Review>

Love it! The pho is delicious! Plenty of options on the menu from sushi to sashimi to fried rice. But the star of this place is the pho. Clean dinning room and the restrooms are well maintained.  Definitely a stop to eat when in imperial valley.<//Review>

<review>The food was bland and the service was terrible.  When we arrived there was only two tables before us and the servers where not attentive at all. They where just standing at the register talking to each other. We never got refills on our drinks. My bill came out to $60 for one Pho soup, 1 Kansas roll and one Bento box. I dont mind paying money for good food and service but this was not the case. Never going back.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

The Valley's Sushi evolution has been slow; Kyotos, Fuzion, Kotori, Sushi Park, K Sushi, now Pho Bay. The rest are trash, but if K Sushi is your GO TO, then you'll love this place! Great food, great service, great prices. Centrally located, must be going east to enter parking lot..<//text>

<Review>I have eaten Pho all up and down the west coast and in my opinion, this place is in the lower third of yhem all.
I only ate chicken Pho, they would not add vegetables, and I felt the broth was a pretty bland,didn't have the hearty chicken stock taste I've come to expect of good Vietnamese soup.
I will probably give them one more try in the future.<//Review>< pics>

Very nice clean and elegant modern decor.  Had the pork bun,  egg rolls and yakisoba chicken.  Just soft open this week,  but great potential.  Rare steak and brisket pho on the menu and I'll try that next time. Good parking and new restrooms.<//Review>

Clean establishment with fresh tasting food. I tried the Brisket Pho and its a plentiful portion for the price, all the ingridients tasted fresh and I loved the fact that they had hot oil to accompinate the broth, (which suprisingly is hard to find in other asian food places in the Valley).

The only down side for me was that the broth itself needed a little more flavor, but thats not something a little more seasoning can't fix.

All in all the food filled me up and it tasted fresh!!!</text>

<Text>Dr. Todd and Dr. Jamie are amazing. I came here yesterday with a sudden very painful injury and they've taken great care of me so far. They are very informative and personable. I am totally new to chiropractic care and am happy and comforted that they explain what they're doing as they do it. I will definitely be coming back here for any future chiropractic needs.< /Text>< user_id>

I walked into the Joint on beach Boulevard in kinda bad shape and filled  out the questionnaire. Todd talk to me and ask me questions and gave me his thoughts on on my condition. Todd is very knowledgeable and helped me understand my back and challenges. When I walk out I feel considerably better mentally and physically. The back is the main frame of the body</review>

<Text>Please give Dr.. Baker more days. He is the best. He has been taking care of my back for almost 4 years. He is such a great Chiropractor. I've seen other Chiropractors and have been in pain when I leave but not with Dr. Baker or Dr. Jamie.< /Text>< gmap_id>

First time here, wish it was just for fun but I hurt my lower back and my sister told me about this place and said she loves it. Dr. Todd is nice and he explained everything very well. The receptionist Danielle was helpful and easy going. Will definitely recommend to others.</text>

<text>I have alot of back/sciatica issues which are so debilitating to say the least. I am from the UK and  now living in Orange County. I used to see a Chiropractor  before and started to search for one here as I was in so much pain which causes me to feel very depressed.  After searching for a Chiropractor I found  The joint  Chiropractic. The girl on reception was so nice. I filled out all the paperwork then had my first session with Dr.Todd. He asked many questions about my situation then started to do his magic. I felt so relieved that finally my pains would disappear  after so long. I went back a few times a week which as suggested and was feeling such relief after my adjustments. Then Covid  came so I didn't go back for a while and then all the pain returned. So with mask on  I'm going back and look forward to it so much.
Thank you Dr. Todd 😊</text>< pictures>

My daughter has been seeing both Dr Todd and Dr Jamie and she loves them both. Both genuinely shows great interests in her well being. Dr Todd has been seeing my daughter the most and I can’t tell you how wonderful he is. He’ll make her feel super comfortable by having a small chat with her, he’ll then tell her what he’ll be doing before doing it and best of all....he’s like a parent engaging in a conversation with his own child asking her how her day was, what she’s been doing and etc. While I’m sitting there watching and listening to their conversations with a big smile on my face. Dr Todd is not only a great Dr, he is also a great person overall in my book. Dr Jamie as well. I don’t think anyone can go wrong if they get one or the other Dr.
There is this one gentleman that sits at the front desk, his name is Dan. Dan has a wonderful smile and is always happy when we walk in the door. He’ll have small conversations with us and ALWAYS have a nice warm smile. When we’re done, he’ll say bye to us and will greet us off so warmly and so nicely. Overall, the office environment is so nice and warm when Dan is around. 👍🏼
I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who needs a correction to fix whatever pain they’re in. My daughter before coming here was in so much pain that a 15 yrs old like her shouldn’t be in. Due to “The Joint” and their affordability, I’m able to take her in 4x’s a month and she feels so good and now she’s a happy and tired 15yrs old with minimal to no pain. Happiness is due to them, tiredness; well, they can’t help her with that. 😊</review>

< review>
Great experience, affordable and fixed my thrown out back. Will have a more detailed review after a full nights rest. For $29 the adjustment was well worth it. Instantly felt way better. Initially there was so much pain while trying to stand up or even walk just a few steps. I can now walk with very minor pain, standing up is a breeze. I know I am only 26 but going to the chiropractor every month might be something I start doing to maintain a healthly spine and overall body.< /review>

I've had lingering neck pain from what i believe to be a pinched nerve. my neck and back were stiff and i lacked mobility. Dr. Todd was very professional and relieved a lot of pain for me. He made sure to explain everything he was doing and why it would benefit me. If I was in town more often, I would definitely make more visits. The staff is also really nice.<//review>

For someone that hates massages and just in general doctors . This place is amazing I have been dealing with some bad back pain and Dr. Tod was very helpful in explaining everything and also making me feel comfortable. After my visit I had awesome results the pain was almost completely gone and my neck felt a huge relief. Thank you and can’t wait to come back in a few days .</Text>

<Text>I've been using Chiropractors since I was 15.
I am very picky as to who I let work on me. In fact I went close to a year because my Chiropractor of over 15 years was simply too far away. [I moved to HB]

So I decided to give this "Joint" a try. Well after just 1 visit to the Huntington Beach location, I found my new Chiropractor!

The location is convenient, freeway close and both the staff and the Doctors are AMAZING!

Give The Joint Chiropractic a try. The only thing you gotta lose is that pain that's been messing up your life!

Do yourself a solid and sign up for the monthly program. Unless of course your health and comfort is not worth a few dollars a month.< /Text><Response>None<//Response><name>rambler khawsy<//name><date>1560984632907</date><UserId.>113293498169580757091</UserId.>< Gmap_id>

First time here. Walked in with a pain in my upper back, hard to turn my head, and hurt to take a deep breath. After my adjustment I could move more freely with less pain. Love the open atmosphere and friendly staff!< /review>

I have been a member of The Joint Chiropractics for 3 years. I have experienced the wellness of being consistently treated at many of their locations. I have a chronic elbow issue that Dr Todd treats exceptionally well. His knowledge and understanding of the smaller joints, such as my elbow, is outstanding. As I continue to live an active lifestyle, I am grateful for Dr Todd and his ability to keep me pain free.<//review>

< Review>
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!! I started coming here when I found out I was pregnant. Dr. Todd did a great job of adjusting my neck and back all throughout my pregnancy and keeping me as pain-free as possible. He also gave me excellent tips of what I could do at home to keep things on track. I kept coming right up until my due date. In fact, Dr. Todd adjusted me the day before I gave birth! He always works with you to accommodate whatever you may have going on. Even though my last few months of adjustments were done with me on my side and back it left me feeling great!!! So thankful for the good work they do here. Plus the joint makes chiropractic care affordable for those whose insurance doesn't cover it.< /Review>

<text>Ok fine... ill post a review... 😆 only cuz i think this place is that good.  And i wanna help this place that has been so worthwhile to me.  They mainly consist of two of the same chiropractors that talk to you (i mean give u advice too) for the duration of your visit 5-10 minutes for the crackling.  But i can see the effort they make to have it feel unrushed where they'd extend the talk/treatment for u even when ur rdy to go out the door and already walking towards the exit 😆.  Today i told my chiro (theres a male and female who are both knowledgable and like... talk to u and give u info like ur in a classroom) that i was getting a lil burnt out and he responded, among other things that its ok to be selfish and tend to yourself, which is already in a way what im already doing by being "here" at the joint.  I was like.  Oh man hes right 😆.  Go me???  Other times hed say things like...my back and my muscle and my shoulders and stuff like that which is kind of boring to read about in a review, in a way lol.  And actually you know what.  You can prod him and her for info and you dont have to go to school for it, which is a nice perk for me.  Im always working with my hands and its nice to streamline my particular conditioning with the correct and trusted answers they provide without doing the work to research it 😆.

Now i work with better form and know how to stretch and stuff to better my understanding intimately for my job, which puts me at an advantage compared to others at my workplace.

Thank you @the joint chiropractic.  The particular people you have chosen for this location are very valuable to me.< /text>< Pictures>

I drive an hour round trip at least once or twice a week just to be treated by Dr. Cunningham. He’s the only one that can fix me. But then I go and mess myself up again 🤷‍♀️I have a 3 year old who thinks I’m a human jungle gym< /Review>

The joint, changing your perspective on chiropractic health. Easy, convenient and quick. There are alot of options here. The initial consult has some paperwork involved but you wont be dissapointed.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Dr. Todd is very professional, while still maintaining a great sense of humor. I have gotten migraines from the time I was about 10, and I started seeing a chiropractor around that time. I'm always picky about who works on my neck and when I found the joint I wasn't sure whether I was going to find anyone I would like or not, but dr. Todd does a great job! Highly recommend him whether you new to chiropractic or have been going for years.< /text>< Pics>

I was a mess when I first came in to see her and she was incredibly patient, compassionate, and understanding. She was also quick to respond and very direct in conversation. Words cannot describe how blessed I am to have met her. I am so grateful for her. If you are looking for an experienced and professional lawyer, then Stephanie is the right lawyer for you.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Conducted business with Stephanie's office over 30 years ago.
She was kind enough to finalize a motion and out of the kindness of her heart, took care of that matter for me.  I stopped in from Washington to pick up the final paperwork from last year for the secretary named Kathy from last year just did not seem to get my mailing address correct and that was the delay....crazee!
Thanks to Chrissy on my visit today I think we got it down right!<//text>

<Review>Stephanie was a bright light in a dark time. Her office and staff are warm and professional. After hearing my situation, she comforted me greatly by explaining the next steps in the process, in a way that only someone with deep understanding and experience can. Throughout the court process, which had hickups and time sensitive issues, she was great at communicating and never left me in the dark; allowing me to rest easy knowing I was in good hands.<//Review></record>

Stephanie did an amazing job in defending me against serious criminal accusations.  She was very responsive to our communications and explained clearly the available options and process. As well as being an effective representative for me  in the court, she was also very human and empathetic in my discussions with her. Thank you Stephanie!< /Review>

You will not regret hiring her! I love how she fought for me, listen to my concerns and kept me informed through our my whole court case. Her assistant as well was very helpful! They both made everything less complicated for me and I’m truly grateful for it! I ended up getting my case dropped. Thanks to Stephanie! She’s definitely superwomen but in the eye of the law!< /Text>

<text>From the very beginning I could tell that Stephanie stood apart from other attorneys I had spoken too. She did not give any judgement and was very professional. And she provided a lot of great advice and insight. She was able to give me the best possible outcome for the case I brought her. And she has always been able to answer my questions. She truly cares.<//text>< Pics>

Let me tell you folks, Stephanie is the real deal. I went shopping around San Jose for lawyers to get opinions about my case. She provided no BS and told me straight up what I was looking at. And let me tell you, it wasn’t looking good. While all the other lawyers tried to sell themselves, she just laid it out there about what I was facing. I was looking at serious time. And so over the few weeks she answered all my questions any time day or night. I didn’t even have to go to court for my court date. All she said was stay by your phone. So on the day of my court date, I was on my way to work and she called me to tell me she needed me at the court house. I was in shorts, my work T-shirt, and flip flops. I get there and she lets me know I got a deal of a lifetime. No time in. And I’m being absolutely honest that I had a minimum time in requirement that was somehow avoided. I signed some papers, we walked straight in the court room up to the podium cutting everyone who was sitting waiting for their turn. And I plead to the deal she got. I’ve looked extensively online extensively with people in the situation as me, and none of them got out of going to jail. Absolutely none. With her previous experience as DA of the county, it’s obvious that this lady knows all the judges, all the DA’s, and literally got me a deal that isn’t possible to other lawyers. And if u think getting a public defender is the best option, it’s absolutely NOT! Stephanie is the way to go. Thank you Stephanie for being hands down the best lawyer I’ve ever known and for fighting for me. Your clients are very lucky to have you on their side. And to all thinking about Stephanie, I promise you, you will regret not going with her. She is the guardian angel of defendents in Santa Clara county.</review>< Pictures>

<Resp>None</Resp><review>I interviewed four lawyers about my case and Stephanie was the clear winner. She had a plan for my case and told me what I needed to do in order for her to get the best outcome. If you are willing to work hard then Stephanie will work even harder on her end. Stephanie got me the best possible outcome I could have imagined for in my case. I am extremely glad and grateful I chose her to represent me. She was always available to answer any questions I had (and I had many) and genuinely cared about me throughout the whole process. She is very organized and punctual and gets things accomplished in a timely manner. I can’t say enough good things about her and I would recommend her to anyone.</review><rating>5< /rating><Gmap_id>0x808fcb6ecae6f737:0xe767ae2cc7487583</Gmap_id>< name>

Being a student, she understood me and agreed to charge lower than others for my case. The outcome was even surprising. No jail time. She even helped me to wave some fees which saved me alot. I have recommended her to few of my friends and they are really thankful i did. Very professional and polite lady. She’s the best.

<Review>Stephanie was awesome. My ex wife invented charges of domestic violence, which didn't exist at all, as we divorced. Stephanie helped get the case cleared. She was fast, understood the situation well, didn't need much back and forth communication, and saved me. Highly recommend</Review>< pictures>

Few months back, I was screwed up with a false DV case, Previously the attorney whom I hired left me for some reason, I felt abandoned and hopeless. At that time Stephanie accepted my case and not charged a single doller as she understood my financial situation. Then she quickly got the case dismissed, even though the case is kind of complicated. I paid her several days after case got dismissed, until that point she not asked her fee. NO ATTORNEY CAN BE THIS MUCH KINDFUL.  She responded for my every message through phone and tolerated and replied  my long emails with lot of questions. As a DV victim I have trust issues, but she broke all my psyclogical barriers and gain trust by her professionalism, valuable guidance, kindness and with the positive end results, Now she sitting in my heart  as a hero. I had a chance to meet her once, at that time, she did not judge me instead she treated me very well.  She took care of me legally even after the case was over and done some necessary things exactly what I needed. I will be grateful at her for my life time. Her Assitant Linda also so friendly and helpful. Thanks to respected Stephanie and her team!< /Review>< Rate>

<review>Best decision I've made in 2019 is taking Stephanie's help.
She is compassionate, reliable, transparent, and best in what she does.
Every time I had a query or concern, she responded and that clarity helped me find comfort. I'm very grateful for her.< /review>< rating>

I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Stephanie, she’s a god send and a life saver. I would recommend her services to all of my friends and family. In my opinion she’s the best at what she does and looks graceful while doing  so. She breaks down all the super confusing legal vernacular into laymen’s terms so you actually can understand what’s going on. On top of all that, she genuinely cares about her clients and has called to check up on me and see how I’m doing. If you ever find yourself behind bars, call Stephanie Rickard!</Review>

Stephanie is a gem. We have no doubt that she is the best criminal defense lawyer in the Bay. We are thankful that we hired her to handle our case. She miraculously secured the best outcome we imagined, even though the odds were against us.

Stephanie is sharp. We appreciated her direct, no-nonsense approach, and her high level of experience in her field. She is well connected, respected, and owns the courtroom. We placed all of our trust in her and followed all of her advice. We are grateful we did because the charges faced would have put my family’s future in jeopardy.

Stephanie is warm. We didn’t feel judged, and she treated us with respect. She is very efficient over text, and took time to address all of our concerns thoroughly in person and over the phone. We strongly believe that we couldn't have achieved the positive result we did without her expertise.

Thanks to Stephanie, our future is bright.< /review>

Working in the legal industry for as long as I can remember, never have I had the opportunity to to see such a well oiled machine that Stephanie and her team have going. From the beginning they were amazing, kept my panic a bay, and 99.99% of the time responded to my emails by phone, on the same day,  when it easily could have been answered through email. She and her staff did this to make sure nothing was lost in translation. My case was handled with great attention and care. I am very happy I made the decision to hire Stephanie after my friend highly recommended her to me after she assisted in her case. She was able to get charges dropped, fines dropped and and much much more. Her support staff are amazing and we’ve been on first name basis since the beginning like old friends. Stephanie is nothing less than a powerhouse attorney who will (and has) gone the distance for her clients. A decision I will never regret. - Stella</Text>

I’ve had Stephanie before for previous cases, and from the moment i contacted her, she was on top of things. I was very scared, and she made sure to clearly inform me of the materials i needed to gather together prior to my court date, and when the time came, she was able to keep me out of jail. I am super appreciative of her and her work, and would recommend her to anyone in need of an amazing lawyer with a heart of gold.< /Text>

My experience with Stephanie Rickard was a great one and I will recommend her because she is very professional, knowledgeable, caring and competent lawyer. It was easy to talk to her and she would respond to my text in a timely manner. I'm so thankful for the outcome in my case. Six months after my court outcome, she processed my record expungement and granted me a clean background check record. This was my first encounter with the law and first lawyer that I hired, was an awful lawyer. Every time I called or text him, it would take a day, two or three days before he gets back to me. He was not doing much and at one point he told me “You don’t call me, I’ll call you”. At that moment, I told myself that I need a new lawyer and I was so happy to find Stephanie. In my first encounter with Stephanie, I felt her sincerity, kindness and professionalism that increased my hope for a happy outcome.<//Text>

Linda was kind enough to get me in to briefly speak with Stephanie, primarily for a referral to another ethical attorney who specializes in what I needed. (And by fit me in, I mean at 6pm which is past her 5pm closing!)

So very kind of both of them, as they knew I needed advise quickly! Such a nice change to find a caring, ethical, respectful and knowledgeable firm with heart ♥️ & soul!!!

Thank you Stephanie and Linda and keep up the AMAZING work, as it restored my faith in what has been 10+ years of unethical dealings with Attorneys! (Unbelievable how many lies you can get away with in ‘Family Court’.)</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Excellent, awesome, outstanding & simply superb. She managed my case very well. Her fee is worth every penny & I strongly recommend her. I am on H1b Visa and I got a DUI. I did visited 2 other attorneys before her, but no one gave me confidence and moral support that she gave. So if it was not her I would have ended up with weekend work + High Fine + DUI school for more than 3 months. But because of Stephanie I only have to pay little fine + 3 month DUI school and only 2 yrs probation. Usually DUI class instructors say Attorneys milk money without doing anything, but when they looked at my record they said Stephanie did awesome job.<//Text>

<Text>I'd strongly recommend this lawyer.

Stephanie clearly stands out among all lawyers I've met locally. When in her office, She patiently answered all of my questions, and also explained how the law system works locally here. Provided visions, strategies, probabilities, etc., for each possible outcome, after carefully listening my detailed story with notes taken. On the other hand, she is super knowledgeable, professional, and has excellent experience and expertise.

Then, I became her client. She worked hard. She responded my call or text messages promptly. She is very sharp and smart. And besides, I am not feeling the normal distance between a successful lawyer and the client. Instead, it feels like she is a friend who really care about me and willing to think from my perspective. Whatever strategy or measures she took turns out very effective. Eventually earlier today, she helped me to get the best possible result.

Throughout the whole process, she guided me actively what's going on and what's the next step in a very clear and professional manner. The experience working with her is obviously good. I am so grateful that Stephanie helped me.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><GmapID>0x808fcb6ecae6f737:0xe767ae2cc7487583<//GmapID><UserId.>107049932758901877905</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Stephanie Rickard is a brilliant and highly regarded Criminal Defense Attorney who stands preeminent amongst her peers in the legal profession. She has excellent ratings from all her clients and has an immensely impressive success rate, and I would highly recommend her office as the one and only law office anyone should consult with if they are ever in a situation facing any manner of criminal charges.
My family was privileged to have her represent us in a complex case, which she recently resolved successfully with the best possible outcome, while having several serious charges dropped. And we truly believe that no other Attorney would have been able to achieve a fair resolution as such, as successfully as she did. Right from the start of our initial consultation with her, we felt absolute confidence in her expertise and professionalism in handling our difficult case, and we knew she would fight hard to get the best result for us, which is exactly what she delivered.
Stephanie by all means is the crème de la crème in her profession, and no matter the complexity of your case she will be by your side to give you the best legal representation possible, and whatever the outcome may be she will defend you with finesse and integrity. She is completely dedicated to each case she handles, and is also very compassionate and caring towards her clients and will always have time to answer any questions and provide reassurance however busy her schedule may be.
She has a nuanced understanding of the legal framework, and will work with you every step of the way to get all the necessary information needed to help with the case, and will keep you up to date of the court process in a timely manner.
She is also very personable and compelling, and when she walks into the courtroom her presence is known to all, including the judge and prosecutor.  And while we were lucky not to have our case go to trial, if it had, undoubtedly she would have been fearsome, admired and a force to reckon with!
We would also never forget her wonderful assistant Linda who is incredibly efficient and was always there to greet us with a smile, and treated us like family everytime we walked into her office. Stephanie's law office truly cares and believes in what they do, and it's an overwhelming experience to have someone like Stephanie believe in you and speak on your behalf.
And not only is she an outstanding Attorney at Law, but she is also an amazing human being! This beautiful lady gave our peace of mind back to us, and we consider ourselves lucky to have had her on our side. And though this one platform is certainly not enough to express the deep gratitude we feel for Stephanie, we do hope that she understands how much her esteemed counsel meant to us.
Thank you Stephanie from the bottom of our hearts!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Date>1464469202702< /Date><Rating>5</Rating><review>I recently ran into some trouble with the California Business and Professions Code, and I suddenly found myself charged with a violation in the felony category.  In addition there was the possibility of a one-year jail sentence. A few friends had their favorite general or business attorneys to recommend, but I am glad that I judged that I needed a good criminal defense attorney.

I checked out lots of  attorney reviews on line.  Stephanie Rickard had excellent reviews.  I was able to get a timely appointment.  Upon meeting with her my wife and I were impressed that she had the right combination of experience, I think she said it was 20 or 25 years, verbal ability, professional appearance, and affordable fees.

She promised to get, and succeeded in getting, the case resolved for a reasonable fixed fee with the caution that a jury trial would entail additional fees, but she doubted it would need to need to go to trial. And she was right.

During all the time we were waiting for the final outcome my wife and I were quite comfortable that I had a good lawyer working for me.

So now I am pleased that I have no felony on my record, just 2 counts of a misdemeanor and 200 hours of community service to do.

I can recommend Stephanie Rickard with no reservation.  Five stars in every category.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1587588288421, 'text': 'Thank you'}</Resp><gmap_id>0x808fcb6ecae6f737:0xe767ae2cc7487583< /gmap_id></record>

I was facing prison time and charges which would have ruined my professional career and taken me away from my son. In the beginning I was understandably very anxious and wanting to be proactive but Stephanie reassured me that she had this under control and that my focus should be working on myself and my mental health recovery. She referred me to a therapist who is amazing and I feel like I wouldn't have been able to manage without these two women. They worked together directly to ensure I had the best possible outcome in court. Stephanie has a presence in the courtroom unlike any other attorney there. She runs the show. She is professional, quick witted and has all the experience required to get you where you need to be. I felt proud that she was my attorney. She also personally knows the right people at the DA's office. This was a year and a half long process for me and at times seemed never ending. But Stephanie always reassured me and made me feel like there was hope. Without going into too much detail about my case, I can tell you the outcome was the best possible one and even better than I was expecting. Yesterday my case was dismissed. My charges will be dropped and my arrest record will be sealed. I can now move on with my life and I have Stephanie Rickard to thank for it. I can tell you with 100% certainty that I would not have gotten these results if it wasn't for her. I will also say that her rates are more than reasonable. Thank you Stephanie!!!<//review>< rating>

<text>Stephanie is simply amazing!

I’ve done a lot of shopping for lawyers to help me in my specific case, and none of them clicked until I came to her law firm.
From the very first moment we met she made me feel warm and welcomed. She knew she could help me in my situation, and right after that meeting I was confident she was going to make things happen.

And she did just that.

A few weeks later my case was set aside and it was perfectly in alignment for background checks for my new career.

No matter the case I am absolutely confident that Stephanie will give her full attention to your case as provide you with the best possible outcome.</text>< pics>

Quick and efficient. Stephanie has a way of connecting with clients and understands that things happen. She is a realistic representative who goes to great lengths to help you get your life back as quickly as possible. She managed to get my case heard, dealt with and figured out within a 3 weeks of me contacting her and even went to court for me so I could continue to make it to work. I would highly recommend the use of Stephanie.< /text>

Stephanie is a kind and considerate person who treats her clients with the utmost respect. .  She knows more than the law.  She knows the DA’s office, She knows the judges.  She strategizes the best approach in orchestrating a favorable outcome  based upon who she is working with.  I would  heartily recommend Stephanie as a very capable and gifted defense attorney.< /Text>

<text>Stephanie was recommended to us and we are so glad we went to her to resolve  my daughter's felony cases.  She has consistently gone above and beyond our expectations.  She has appeared numerous times on our daughter's behalf. What could have been an extended prison sentence was reduced drastically.  We highly recommend Stephanie.<//text></record>

I would advise anyone facing criminal charges to hire Stephanie and have her represent  them all the way to the box if needed. I was facing some serious charges myself and was preparing myself to go to prison for a long time. She worked her magic and i got 6 months with half in the county jail. She definitely owns the courtroom</review>

THE BEST DECISION IN MY LIFE was to hire Stephanie Rickard as my lawyer. Me being a 29 year mother of a 7 years old amazing son who just recently back home the thought of being taken into custody just was not a option not to me and when in the court room not to Stephanie . This lawyer is not just a lawyer she's family to me and that's what I felt in the c10ourtroom when she was by my side 2 times that I was or should have been remanded and sitting in there for 6 months. All the judge had and the da was MAJOR RESPECT for Stephanie and what I was just amazed by was her ability to DEFEND AND PROTECT me as her client. I felt like if I didn't have her I was going to be chewed up and spit out and nothing that I could say or do would help me get out of the mess I was in. I can honestly say that Stephanie's fees were inexpensive and that every dime was beyond worth it spent on her services. SHE IS THE REASON I HAVE MY FREEDOM TODAY  and that's something she took pride and dedication in. If you need a lawyer in any aspect of the judicial system she is very very educated and very smart and persuasive and to say the least persistent. To have the out come we had yesterday morning in court was a MIRACLE! She never gave up and never let me be insulted by the da. If The feeling of having your family at your side when your in the position of facing criminal charges is what your looking for CALL STEPHANIE ! She's not 5 she's a 10!!!< /Text>

Thank You for that you did for my best friend(JB).

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>The Vista Sports Park is a great spot for sporty families. While dad throws the ball around with your older kids, mom can enjoy watching the younger ones explore the playgrounds. The one thing I was really hoping this park had was a paved sidewalk around the perimeter for an easy stroller jog. However, we still got to run around the turf fields which is probably better for my knees anyway haha

💰This park is free
🎠2 playgrounds but no swings. The ground is a rubber surface and it is shaded with canopies
🚽Restrooms
🖼Small lawn
🌳Not a lot of trees
🧺Picnic tables under canopy shade
🛣Playground is far from busy roads
🚙Plenty of parking spaces in the lot
🏈Huge turf football fields
⚽️Huge turf soccer fields
⚾️ Baseball fields
🪑Bleachers at all fields</review><user>113533882510002282390</user>< pictures>

Best time to use soccer fields is as soon as they open every day at 7am. Been coming every day since Tuesday and there is hardly any people and the setting is great. There were multiple baseball games this morning and it was total chaos. There was no social distancing whatsoever. I saw a few parents here and there without there face masks, so that was concerning. Im glad the park still gets to be used by the public.<//text>

<Text>People kept a safe, social distance. We met some friends with their kids there. We kicked the ball for a little while, then we play a "cascarita match" and it was fun, safe and clean as always.  We had a blast.  I heard some women exercise doing Zumba for a little while, by the baseball fields. We'll probably be back soon.<//Text>< pics>

Bathrooms are clean,  play ground is clean. During the day the fields are pretty wide open which allows my kids to run around freely,  without worrying if they will interrupt a pickup game< /text>

My family and I love this place. It's not like a "regular" park. It focuses more on providing a space to practice baseball and soccer. There is also a little jungle gym thats perfect for children. The restrooms are in the central area of the park. There is also a long nature trail that's perfect for dogs or an hour hike.</Text>

<Review>I love this park I have always had great experiences here, but at this moment that I am at this park I see some unsafe things that need to be fix. the rock climbing wall is missing some bolts, making it wiggle which can be very dangerous for the children and one of the slides has a crack in it, overall that side should be replaced. I have seen many children fall face first going down the slide, and this happens with all ages. If these few things were to be done I would feel more comfortable with my children coming here without then getting hurt from the park itself.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Awesome park for sports activities like baseball, football, and soccer. They have a small playground, concession stand, and a  hiking trail, with some pretty cool views. It's well lit, and nestled in a new well to do neighborhood.< /review>

Nice facility. Concessions is open if there's baseball. Decent bathrooms, and good little play area for young kids. Sometimes they forget to turn the lights on, and the field turf needs some significant repairs, but it's really nice for what it is.<//review>

A very nice sport park, with 3 baseball diamonds (2 little league, 1 pony league), and two full sized soccer/football artificial turf fields. The Vista Storm soccer club uses these fields extensively during the week for practice. There are public bathrooms, a shaded playground, and a concession stand that is open at times during sporting events.< /review>

In addition to the baseball and soccer fields, there is also a playground and a trail that connects to Ranch Guajome Adobe.  There are also public restrooms including a single occupancy "family" restroom.</Text>

Absolutely amazing tacos! Some of my favorite in Oakland. They have a selection of drinks and beer. The restaurant itself is very large although during COVID there is only a small amount of outdoor seating.</Text>

Some of you may not be aware of all the time and effort I've been putting into my research. I've scoured the internet, driven all over the East Bay, and talk to many people. I think I found it. The best breakfast burrito in the East Bay. I will be continuing my research to confirm my findings.</Text>

<review>Classic tacos.   had the Al Pastor and the Chile Verde.   Al Pastor was a bit greasy but really tasty.    Chile Verde was a bit salty, but also really tasty.
Both had so much meat on them they were a bit tricky to pick up, but nice thick double corn tortillas held them together nicely.   Great place for a quick cheap bite before a show at the Fox</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Date>1583703161902<//Date>< rating>

I have been to Xolo a few times, they have a really good menu and plenty of options if you are coming with a friend who may have different eating preferences.  My only thing is the burritos are not as big as I would like them to be, and they do not have a salsa bar and charge extra for salsa on the side with your food. Other than that I would give this place a five star review, because I love the decorations of the place and they have really high ceilings and have seating upstairs and outdoor seating.<//text>

I told my friends about this place with my warmest recommendations. I  go to this restaurant often. This recommendation is always successful. The meals are appetizing and the crew is very friendly and cooperative. Every time  we go to this place we enjoy a cheerful time.  I recommend this place with pleasure.<//review>

This was for a take-out of guacamole and chips and two crispy beef tacos and they were delish and fast! I was hungry and it came out so quickly and it was tasty! I needed a quick fix as I was going to a show a few doors down and I knew this place opened until 10 pm on a Tuesday night so I entered, ordered and was out of there within 5-10 minutes!<//Text>

<text>The tacos were delicious, and ready and brought to the table so unbelievably quickly! I tried the beef and the chicken tacos. They just melted in the mouth. They were loaded up with meat and onions and cilantro. Other people were happy Witt their tacos, including shrimp. The menu isn’t huge, but it offered a good selection of burritos and tacos, with a good selection of beverages. There’s plenty of seating. The bathroom was clean, which is always a good sign for the place overall. The staff were friendly. The place was busy pretty late on  a weekday, but not too loud to have a conversation. I’d want to try more before giving it five stars, but I’m definitely open to the possibility. They also have a big bike rack out front, so bonus points for that! It’s close to BART.</text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808f80b274a0f49b:0x1e1821f195ca9615< /GmapID></record>

Very cool taqueria tucked away in a shop front. Its a la carte menu is pretty extensive but everything we had was delicious! The only thing that sucks is finding seating, which there is plenty of but someone has to then find your table to being the food. As well if you need another drink you have to get back in line. The atmosphere is totally worth it though, especially where we sat in the back outside.<//text>

<Review>I went back a two days after my first visit...great tacos!! The prices are fantastic and the tacos are stuffed.

My order was quick coming out and the staff were friendly and helpful. Good vegan & gf options (hongos tacos!).

Sitting upstairs offers a great view of Telegraph, but if it's a hot day be prepared to be a little hotter up there. The back patio seating is chill and a great place to sit and talk.

Definitely recommend!</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDh72SqO88NZT6TGYEbmd-ticdilc7y0n0lFg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiy-Nd0oH54mK1bdppDhZpQ8nV-uyOTbW-Of0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

< review>
I recently moved back to California and one of the biggest things I was excited about is finding my new taco spot. Well, Xolo is the place. I probably come here once a week and I don’t even live in Oakland anymore. The crispy beef tacos are the best and make sure you get the spicy red salsa!</review>

Also, the service was insanely fast. I'm not sure I was seated more than 2 minutes before my food was on the table. Going back here for sure.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Or at least it feels like it does. It's chicken soup with grilled chicken, tortilla strips, a little bit of heat and a lot of lime, and even with a cold you can taste it, and feel it working. My friend got the Danger Dog, a bacon-wrapped hot dog in a flour tortilla with all the fixings and she was loving it. The brownie was moist and big enough to split (full disclosure -- I couldn't taste it because of my cold, but my friend said it was delish). Ordering at the counter is quick and the food comes out fast and delicious, so don't mind the line, you'll get to where you're going in time. It's one of the cheaper alternatives before a concert at the Fox or the Paramount. There's table seating on the main floor, upstairs, and a small patio outside in the back. A large-screen tv downstairs shows mostly local sports or soccer.<//Review>< gmapID>

<text>Xolo is one of those larger holes in the wall that you could walk past and not think twice about it. You'd regret doing that though once your friend tells you how solid it is. There's nothing like finishing up a concert at the Fox, or seeing a show at the Paramount and finishing up the evening with a burrito, Corona , and guac from Xolo. If you're taking a date here there is this adorable little space in the back that is outside and overflowing with plants. You could miss it if you didn't know about it - but it's the type of experience that would leave your date thinking, wow, this person has good taste and is practical.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>Decent tacos. Friendly, clean and open room. Clean bathrooms and friendly staff.

My main complaint is that a lot of time the meat in the tacos is dry and tastes like it has sat in the warmer way too long.

Still, I come here a fair bit and don't mind it at all.< /review><date>1556081831657</date>< user_id>

We were here to see a show at the Fox Theater across the street.  This location was perfect for both our timetable and our budget.

It was a hot day and either the air conditioning is non existent or wasn't keeping up.  It was hot in the restaurant.  The ambiance was great.  It's eclectic and funky.  The layout of the restaurant makes me wonder if they just kept expanding in to adjacent businesses as they grew.

The food was good.  The only knock I would give is that it took a while for us to get our food.<//Text>

OVERPRICED tacos in a beautiful, upbeat space. Horchata was good. Had shrimp tacos, not really worth it. Chicken tacos was far better! A good one time spot. I rather support the taco truck down the street. GOOD first date place, if youre bougie.< /Text>

My pork and tomatillo burrito was dope, and the staff was friendly. It's not a fancy place, and that's probably why it's so awesome. Get you a cold Pacifico to wash it all down with.</text>

Ordered the steak burrito. *sighs* well..... I ordered what was supposed to be a steak burrito got home only to be completely Disappointed!

1. My 3 year old son foot is  bigger (length & width )than my burrito

2..my  Burrito look like it was dipped in grease after being wrapped. I can fry chicken in my stomach with all the grease that I’d bitten out of my burrito.

3. Can anyone help me find the meat that was supposed to be in my burrito ? My ✌🏽Steak✌🏽
(<— air quotes) was 98% beans!! Every bite
( the 4 that I had taken) made me gag because there was sooooo much beans. After the third scoop they should’ve put the spoon down.

4. I had enough white( not red 😒) onions in my ✌🏽Steak✌🏽 Burrito I could sell them to the while foods down the street.

5. THEY CHARGED FOR SALSA... FOR SALSA!!! ( yes I am screaming)

They do use quality ingredients....I can’t say that. However, if you’re lucky enough to actually get a decent size burrito without the mountain and 5 gallons of beans  and maybe some meat then your food will be good.

This is totally a hipster spot! I am born and raised in Oakland I know good Mexican food when I get it .

I will continue to support the Taqueria’s that are in the hood and surrounding area, there’s one on first Street a Taco Truck that’s really good I would definitely stay going on there!

Oh yeah! Before I forget their burritos are way overpriced to get what I got $10 for a burrito< /text>

Great space and pretty good food. I come here every once in a while to get my fix for tasty, heavy Mexican food and mega crispy chips. The space is themed in a modern take on Mexico, with bright colors, metal surfaces and nice illustrative elements. The burritos are very filling but don’t quite knock it out of the park for me.<//Text>

<review>The surf and turf burrito was a fail, unless 1 piece of shrimp constitutes as “surf”. Minus the lack of surf, it was meh. Mostly beans. The ambiance is very, very casual... like inner city high school cafeteria that hasn’t been cleaned for a minute, type of casual. The staff is nice enough. The best thing in the joint is the huge TV always on soccer. Honestly, we should’ve gone to Chipotle.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Incredible food choices. This place bucks the trend for Mexican restaurants. Innovative options such as the Impossible tacos and chile rolleno burritos make this place a must go. It also helps that it's open later in the evening when such fares become exponentially more desirable.</Text><Time>1553407531671</Time>< rating>

After I moved away, this was the restaurant I missed most in Oakland, and when I came back to visit, I couldn't skip it.  Still holds up, these burritos are muy muy delicioso! Festive and colorful inside, but if you want to be real cool, check out the hidden patio in back.<//Text>

Food is good, if you ever get it. Restaurant sent me the wrong food on delivery then apparently decided to stop taking delivery orders meaning they were some how off the hook for correcting their errors. So I got stuck with some one else's order and no help. Lousy way to treat a customer.<//Review>

I hate telling people about this place because it would get to popular, but seems the word is getting out.  We order the impossible tacos which are vegetarian but taste damn good and as authentic as you will get.  They also have awesome rice and refried beans are amazing.

This is perhaps my favorite spot in Oakland for tacos. This is a worthwhile place to grab Mexican food if you're ever in the uptown neighborhood.<//Text>

<Text>One of my favorite places to meet people for food and drinks in Uptown Oakland. Great space, plenty of room, and the back courtyard is great to hang when the weather is nice. It is pricey, especially the tacos, but they're delicious and unique. I love the Vampiro tacos.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

<Review>Went with my wife. Enjoyed some very nice Horchata while devouring 3 tacos each. They were a tad greasy because this place loves melted cheese. They are also small, as others have mentioned. However, they are much wider than most, and I still found myself full.

Their cabbage + lime + cilantro topping is superb, and a dash of their table-top hot sauce topped it off.

Overall, it was very nice. The atmosphere was nice and quiet on a Saturday night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It felt very clean as well.</Review>< username>

<review>Xolo is really stepping up their vegan options. First they had Impossible Burger meat, now they use Beyond Meat for tacos, burritos and more.  Also I think their pozole is vegan. Another excellent vegan option is the Hongos or mushroom filling which they will put in a taco or burrito and maybe some other things. All of their vegan options are tasty. So, although most of the menu consists of cruelly extracted meat items (individuals that want to live as badly as we do), Xolo does a great job of moving in the right direction!< /review>< rating>

My almost $12 Burrito was full of mostly rice with hardly no meet and no shrimp. Im NOT exaggerating. I ordered the surf and terf. Where was the meet?? And very small.

Way overpriced!

Also had tacos. Smallest tacos Ive ever seen. Lol. And again, not much on it for the expensive price.</review>

Best place to get a burrito in the immediate area? Probably. Decent in a pinch or before a show at the Fox? Yes. Well you leave looking forward to visiting again soon?

Xolo is an okay place for a quick bite near the Fox before or after a concert. Their food is a bit pricey but decent. I like the Vampiro tacos and steak/shrimp burrito. These aren't Mission Burritos, so don't expect a lot. The Alfred Hitchcock poster is cool though.< /Text>

<review>Small restaurant, I almost could not get into the my booth seat because the tables were so close together.

Do get the mussels, which are called Le mules (I was so confused at first as I do not eat at French restaurants often). I got the provencale Le mules, which is apparently the French version. I also wanted to try to Thai marinated version. The mussels came in a pot, they were very well marinated, make sure to soak some in the soup before eating it. The mussels are naturally small so you can't really get full on them, that's why the menu suggests you get a side of fries.<//review></record></dataset><record>

It's a nice place. Very nice host. Clean too! But hard to find parking at night. Biggest turn off is I paid $10 for what I was told was a super burrito, it turned out to be the size of the grilled stuffed burrito at taco bell down the street that I was too impatient to wait in the long line for. Now the food was ok-good not worth $10 for that small of a burrito. Waste of my money</Text>

Bland & Bourgsie. Overpriced and watered down for the untrained palete. First and last visit, fortunately my boss paid. Should have known by the menu only generically listing beef, pork and chicken. If you walk into a "Taqueria" and they list the meats on the menu that way, turn around and walk out.</Review>

I got the NOPALES burrito and it was AMAZING! it had a spicy pumpkin seed based sauce and eggs and potatoes and delicious black refried beans and so much deliciousness. I thought it had chorizo but I was wrong and frankly, I didn't miss it at all. Would definitely order it again and recommend everyone try it at least once because it clearly has some very Mexican flavors that you don't usually get at burrito places.

Edit: I went back! It was in the afternoon so they didn't have the burrito anymore as it's only for breakfast. I'm hooked on the nopales so I got a tostada with them and also their "Lima soup" which is a super deliciously tangy limey chicken tortilla strip soup. The chicken in the soup was a little overcooked but the broth was so good I didn't mind, that broth is the broth of my dreams. The other thing could be fixed is that the chips were cold but OMG their guacamole was perfection! Highly recommend for their vegetarian/vegan options and for people who want to try some authentic Mexican cactus YUM<//Text>

<review>Xolo is my go-to place when I head to a show at the Fox. It's across the street, has delish food, is relatively inexpensive, and they are fast! My fave order consists of the Vampiro and Machaca tacos. The Vapiro taco is a cheesy corn tortilla filled with perfectly seasoned al pastor crisped to perfection. The Machaca taco is also a corn tortilla but it is stuffed with tender, juicy, slow cooked beef that is shredded and accompanied by soft, sweet bell peppers and onions. Definitely try this place out of you're into Mexican food.</review><gmap_id>0x808f80b274a0f49b:0x1e1821f195ca9615< /gmap_id>< Rating>

The soup is okay, warm and you get it almost as fast as you order it. But there were no bread or anything on the side and the high roof and concrete walls makes the sound very easy to get loud and feel like a cafeteria.<//Review>

Always delish!! Mushroom taco, beef taco and veggie taco are some of my faves. The salad is amazing, although they are inconsistent with amount of toppings. I give a 4 for that and also they've given my vegetarian husband meet accidentally a few times.<//text>

< review>
I didn't take pictures of my burrito because I really didn't want it and wanted to leave but my vegan friend who wanted a burrito so bad was paying& was very hungry. Due to the fact that she is vegan she ordered what was rudely told to her as a "special" burrito ( She deconstructed their ingredients in a veggie burrito by just adding the certain ingrrdients she wanted) by requesting no cheese& certain veggies. That's when a second employee interjected and sternly said "we don't do that!!" He looked annoyed by her request. My friend said but I don't eat meat or cheese and that's why I want specific items on my burrito. On the nenu it does state " ask for vegan options". Howvever, he got a little louder and said But I'm trying to help you so whatever& he walked away. The young man taking her order in the meantime was rolling his eyes in his head. We were not allowed to take a paper menu, seat ourselves to decide what we wanted when we walked in. We were allowed to sit on benches at the entrance to decide, place order and pay before we were allowed to seat ourselves to eat. The burritos are pricey to me compared to the size you receive but they are tasty. The chips are too thick but the red salsa and guacamole is fresh and delicious. Metered parking is near by and hard to find a spot. They have no parking available for customers. Sorry to say, I won't be returning there when I'm in Oakland and wanting a burrito.cyst< /review>

Had the Chile relleno burrito. It was delicious but alot smaller than I thought it would be for the price. Didn't like the hipster atmosphere. Gave this 5 star on food only</text>

<review>I'm going to come out the gate and say the food here is over priced. $16 for aa small burrito and aa bottled beer is crazy by any standard. For what I paid the burrito should have been 2x the size it was. Also the beer didn't taste fresh, I wonder if they know that bottled beer has a 24 day self life. Anyway I won't eat here again.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808f80b274a0f49b:0x1e1821f195ca9615<//gmapID></record>

Coming in to Xolo I was expecting something very special. I must have caught them on a off night. Service wise Xolo was excellent and very welcoming. The video e of the restaurant was very chill around the mid range noise level wise. It's a good date night spot for sure. Xolo however fell short on the grub. The burrito was lacking some true pastor flavor. I ordered the big ranch burrito with chips and salsa. The chips were not fresh and a little on the hard to bite into side. Pick de gallo was straight up tomato onion and cilantro no flare. It could've used some salt, lime juice, and serrano or jalapeño. The salsa verde made me want to go into the kitchen and add more to it. It also lacked seasoning and heat. I'll come back but I won't be ordering or recommending the Big Ranch.</text>

Paid $15.75 for a Steak Burrito and Horchata just for the burrito to be as than a Pepto Bismol bottle. Plus the Horchata was $4 for a 12 oz cup. Was very disappointed in what I paid for.< /Review>

Only 1 star because I can't go any lower..  Asked for a steak burrito but what I got was far from it. Every ingredient placed in it was more like chow mein. Half of the burrito was onions,  barely had any meat. It was practically a chow mein wrap. Couldn't even eat a quarter of it..  Worse place I've ever gone to 0/10 I would never recommend it</Review>

The quality of the burritos are great but there is something about this place that makes it feel a lot less authentic then it could. There aren't a ton of great Mexican food spots around here so Xolo is a good find however everything is way overpriced. They don't serve chips to your table and they want you to pay extra for any salsa for the burritos as well.< /text>

<review>I don't understand how this place has such a high rating. I got the chili rellano burrito. It literally came to the table as I sat down. It looked like it had been microwaved. I cut into it and a pile of grease just came out onto my plate. I was very disappointed because I didn't eat it what I paid for.</review><Gmap_id>0x808f80b274a0f49b:0x1e1821f195ca9615< /Gmap_id><date>1440188919792<//date>< user_name>

<Review>This place sucks. Burritos are $10 and up! Theyre filled with mostly beans and barely any meat! Not to mention they charge for salsa! Its not even authentic.

Food is good but VERY overpriced: $7 for chips and maybe 2 oz. of guacamole, $4 for street tacos (need at least 3 to make a decent meal). Also, the chips are way too crunchy.<//review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Tacos are delicious. I'm a fan of the beef and chile verde ones.The burritos are not the best. The surf-n-turf one sounds good, but it doesn't have much meat or shrimp. It is mostly beans. It advertises pinto beans, but they are actually refried. Really good guacamole and chips. It is counter service and they bring the food out to your table.< /review></record>

<text>This is our go-to taqueria.  Great burritos, tacos, and a hearty giant salad which we'll get and add chicken or camarones to.

Aguas frescas are always available, and the recently-added fried plantains dessert item is delicious.< /text>< pics>

<rating>3</rating><text>Tried their machaca burrito, and while it's good, it's quite messy because of the sauce that's inside. The cantaloupe agua fresca was refreshing. Their food does cost more than the average taqueria, and I'm not quite sure that it's worth the value, to be honest.< /text>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) The taste is good, but the attention is very bad
especially on the part of the lady who is taking the orders, is always bad and apparently they give them the onion because it is more onion than food .....

(Original)
El sabor esta bueno, pero la atencion es pesima
sobre todo por parte de la senorita que esta tomando las ordenes, siempre esta de malas y al parecer les regalan la cebolla por que es mas cebolla que comida.....< /text>
