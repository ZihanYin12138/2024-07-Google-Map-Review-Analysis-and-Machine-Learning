I've been going to Pacific Tires for years. Always reasonable prices and friendly service. Large selection of tires on hand and able to make special orders. I definitely recommend for any tire needs.<//Review>

<Review>Great service and prices! Way better than the large national chains like discount/America's tire. I purchased a set of tires from Pacific Tires about 16 years ago, but since I don't live in LA, I had not been here since. I was visiting from out of town (Utah) and needed a new set of tires before my 650+ mile drive home. Came here on a Sunday morning, both because they were one of the only local tire shops that was open, and because I had a good previous experience. I arrived as soon as the shop opened and was assisted immediately. The shop manager was super helpful, not pushy at all. The price offered was straight forward and included all charges out the door. This was a breathe of fresh air as my experience with the national chains (Discount Tire) is the opposite. They installed my tires right away. I was in and out in under 45 min. I will come back in the future.< /Review>< rate>

This place was amazing! Needed two front tires, had a nail in my back rear tire and needed a spare is what I was told when I got my oil changed earlier today at another place! Went to Pacific off of a recommendation from a coworker and they said the same thing. Fernando helped me and his customer service was nothing less than amazing! He checked the one with the nail and the nail was small when he pulled it out & after inspecting it said it was fine and didn't need to replace it! He recommended two Used front tires that were matching and in amazing condition! 2 for $100! He also let me keep one of my front tires to use as a spare, which was amazing considering my spare was in terrible, Non drive-able condition. Overall spent $110! Not only top notch, HONEST service but such quick service (in and out in 30min) AND OPEN ON A SUNDAY!! I'll definitely be going back here for any services I might need! Thank you Pacific and thank you Fernando!!< /text>

15 minutes to patch a nasty hole in the tire of my SUV. Mounted the patched tire and re-mounted to spare. Some of the best customer service I’ve had at a tire shop in a long time.< /Text>

Within 60 seconds of arriving, they'll have your car jacked up and ready to be serviced. Their prices are great and the service itself has always been top-notch.

<Text>What a hidden gem in the South bay. I've lived in Lawndale most of my life and I just came here for the first time. I was amazed just how fast and  efficient the team was here. Super friendly staff and awesome customer service. I bought new tires $85 for my little car. But what really did it for me is that they offer free rotation every 3 miles so they can wear off evenly. I will be back for my next set of tires. Thank you!< /Text>< rate>

So glad i found this place. I had a bolt in my tire and of course it was a Sunday when no one was open. I went to Just Tires who said they couldnt fix it due to their guidelines. I kept googling and found these guys. Awesome service. Super fast. Wonderful staff. Isabella at the front desk is amazing sweet. Definetly recomend this place for tires, brakes, or a simple fix on your tire. Thank you for being so awesome.<//review>

< Review>
I came first thing in the morning because I knew there was a problem with one of my tires. They got me right on the jack and fixed my tire in about 10 minutes, making me early for work instead of late! Very affordable too. Highly recommend.<//Review>

These guys are gr8 PLUS they stock HERCULES tires [USA-based].  You can always come thru to have your tires checked/air filled.  Furthermore, they were knowledgeable about aftermarket wheel upgrades for my Prius & rav4.  My only wish is that they had more than 1 location, since I drive a lot.<//Text>

I went there to change my tires on 89 Lincoln Town car on June/04/2013
And their mechanic John said, "tires are not the only thing you should worry about."
He charged me $2200 to stop the oil leak by changing Valve covers on my car and also removing the oil pan and cleaing it and put on a new gasket. Also to change rear beake cylinders and repair the axel differential.
I reinspected my car by Midas Mechanic and I discovered extensive oil leak from Valve Gaskets and Oil Pan and brake fluid from rear tires that suppose to be done by John Pacific Tire Mechanic. I spent another $1700 to redo all this work again.
Now I filed a lwasuit for fraud against Pacific Tire and awaiting hearings.
Shame on John and also those dishonest people running such crooked business.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b44a00c25d69:0x452bdac2432f736e<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I came to CME at the recommendation of a friend. My cars air conditioning was not working. The guys at CME were able to diagnose and correct the problem. Their waiting area was clean and quiet. I recommend CME as a reliable and honest auto shop and will return in the future.</review>

<review>not a normal mechanic shop. From the gyst I Got, alot of customers come there that work on thier own cars and have came for a problem they either cant fix or need clarification on. And that's EXACTLY what I came for. He didn't try to sell me on anything. Made sure I understood how The mechanics of The problem worked, gave me options on how To fix IT myself, and was incredibly knowledgable about what he was doing. These guys know thier stuff and aim to help, not just take your money.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Avoid this shop at all costs. The mechanics and staff are corrupt and dishonest. I made the mistake of taking my truck here for a simple smog check. I was told the truck would not pass smog due to a secondary air system error code. They recommended replacing the air check valves for the low price of $175. I agreed to the work under the impression that this would correct the issue and make my truck pass smog.

When the truck did not pass smog a second time, I was told that the fuel pump was malfunctioning due to a "pending code". I declined any further services and when I followed up with a second mechanic, I was informed there is no such thing as a pending code and the diagnostic machine would only show error messages that were actually occurring.

It's sad that a business has to take advantage of customers just to turn a profit. Avoid this shop!!!< /text>< user_id>

<review>Upon calling here they were super friendly and helped me quickly. I made a appointment right as soon as they called because they seemed knowledgeable. They told me my car would maybe be there 2 hours. I was like okay cool. It comes to the day I’m suppose to drop it off everything goes well he informed me it would maybe be 3-4 hours.. I was like okay that’s fine. Got picked up. Around 5:15 nothing yet. They close at 5:30.. so I was kinda confused on why I had no received a call updating me. So anyways I call a couple times before they answer. Finally they let me know that they need to keep it overnight because they didn’t have enough time. Which okay no problem at all. Anyways the next day comes it’s starting to get later in the day so I call. I ask for a price and I’m baffled by the price it takes to fix my car. Mind you before taking my car in I knew what the problem was I just wanted to be sure before I did anything to fix it. $180.00 part. So I ask for a price and they tell me it’s going to be roughly 650.00.. I was like what.. confused I called around to multiple other places.. that were substantially cheaper to fix. When I went in I asked for a price breakdown because honestly I don’t understand how they came up with this number. Well the part was 350. Ordering it from Honda.. when I mentioned orileys had one for 180 they said something like if I got the part from there it would just happen again in a week or two. Mind you.. my car has orileys parts that work just fine.. it’s literally just a egr valve that needs to be replaced. It’s kind of disappointing.. all together at another store 240 to instal with the part. I feel like if you don’t do your research on parts and prices you can easily end up spending way more money than you will somewhere else. If I had a new car and that was the price okay fine. But sorry I’m not spending 600 on a commuter car.   I think cheaper alternatives should be something that is given as a option. And I don’t think telling customers if they buy parts from orileys they’re just gunna have the same problem in a week or two is reasonable. Maybe it was said out of personal experience but I do not believe that is the case In every situation.</review>< Pics>

TLDR:  Car broke down on exit to their shop, limped it into their parking lot.  Broken radiator housing and hose, lost all coolant and made mess on serpentine belt.  Quoted price for housing and hose and belt replacement, but they were HONEST, cleaned the belt and didn't need to replace it, saving me over $100 on the repairs!

My 2008 BMW Z4 broke down on the exit leading to CME Smog and Auto Repair and I was just barely able to make it into their parking lot late on a Saturday night. I received a call from the owner (?) Kerry, on Monday telling what exactly was wrong (broken housing and hose bringing coolant into the engine which, of course, caused loss of all coolant and a mess under the hood, including on the serpentine belt). I was quoted a price for the repairs, including replacement of the serpentine belt, as they do not do well when they get soiled!!! The repairs had to wait a day, as parts had to be transported from Sacramento to Vacaville. I got a call the next day saying the repairs were completed, the coolant system was pressure tested, and everything was okay. Oh, and they were able to clean off the serpentine belt, so they did NOT need to replace that! I am so glad that they were HONEST enough to not repair a part that would still work and I would not have known if it was truly needing replacement! In all, I had them do the repair of the housing and hose, get the oil changed and paid less than the original quote! If I lived in Vacaville, I would definitely return!!!! Thank you Kerry and the team at CME!!!!<//text>

Made me pay for a smog check after telling me my check light engine was on in my car, when they should’ve just not done the smog check knowing it was on. And they don’t do free second smog check like other auto shops.</review>

I made an appointment for an oil change and tire rotation. The work was done while I waited.  The very next day for some reason my vehicle was idling rough and nearly died when I stopped at a signal light.  So I went back to CME and called Kerry and he came out to take a look at it and apparently a wire was loose under the hood. So he checked it out and I drove away a happy camper.  The people at CME are awesome.</review>

<text>Have gone here for years but something has changed. Would advise anyone to find somewhere else to work on your car. Went in for a simple power steering pump replacement (I provided the new pump). When I went to pick up my car which was parked outside the shop, there was a puddle of oil underneath the car. They said that it was all oil from my leak in my rack. My rack had leaked a tiny little drop every now and again before I went in, but they did something so that it would gush out. Now I'm out a couple hundred bucks just so they could screw me over.</text><resp>None</resp>< userid>

They did a very thorough inspection on my front and rear brakes. Even drove it around. They didn't charge me anything.<//Text>

< review>
Unsatisfied they were unable to fix the secondary air system on my truck after  $938. And they had my truck for almost 2weeks. I am very disappointed because on their Website they advertise "we fix right the first time " and it goes on and on etc.. today I went to pick up my truck and they straight up told me "we can't find the problem" after they charge me  $938...

Mi gente no les Recomiendo este lugar no pudieron arreglar mi troca despues de tenerla por casi 2 semanas y nomas me echaban mentiras. mejor si es posible ballan a otro lugar..ellos anunsian en su website que son Buenos pero en railidad no..no tube una buena experiencia en este lugar<//review>

The waitress Melissa was absolutely phenomenal!!  We had a big group of 15 Though we had to sit apart because of covid restrictions she did amazing job with the kids table and adult table...The whole staff was amazing and kind. We will be returning again when we come back to Santa Cruz. Oh and the Ribs 🔥🔥
Were amazing, overall we were very pleased with the food and service. If you do eat here ask for Melissa, she is genuinely a sweet kind hearted person.
You can't go wrong with Back Nine! 🤗<//Text>

Mmmmm, pork skins, they were so good. We were staying at the Inn, went in for Happy Hour, started with the pork skins, that was it, couldn't eat another bite. One appetizer filled 2 of us up. It's really nice inside, great atmosphere. Later on I went down and got a Blackberry Cobbler to take to the room, mmmmm, it was great! Next time I will order dinner, maybe.< /Review>

Got the chicken sandwich, it was bland. Service is good, nice interior, kitchen can get backed up, leaving you waiting for awhile for overpriced food. I have to say though, that the locals love the restaurant.<//review>

Food was decent, but they add 20% gratuity for takeout! When asked, their explanation was due to COVID situation. Not sure that's a legitimate reason for such a high rate of gratuity. They did bring the food out to our car, which was thoughtful.<//review>

The service was over the top, the Angus burgers were cooked to absolute perfection. The restaurant had a great hum of happy diners, a tone that seemed to be missing in visits past.

No direct phone number to call - phone auto  as after several rings only to offer two multi digit extensions to dial that answer after several rings. No signage on driving up. No curbside pickup. No online order and pay. Online menu has typos.

Food was great and portions were enormous.< /Text>

Nobody refilled my water, cleared my table or did the dishes— why would I tip 20% for that? Furthermore they forgot part of my order, I had to drive back and then microwave my families meal— by then the meat dried out. Oh and the Mac and cheese is very similar to box Mac.. eww.

I didn’t consent to a 20% tip. I would have given a 10% TOPs for take out (only because it’s covid and there was no paper plates extra). This was my fav spot. I’m done never going back.

<text>Who knew? I didn’t. Went here with a few gal pals for my birthday and was super impressed with the service, the food and the overall vibe. I don’t know... maybe because I flashed back to the old country club in Columbus, Ohio from 100 years ago where the wait staff was conscientious and the food was made with pride. I miss the ‘60’s sometimes... but only very occasionally. 😐< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

My wife and I and another couple went here because we were able to get reservations just a couple days earlier.  Being Valentine's Day, we expected it to be busy.  What we didn't expect was to be seated in a seldom used back room with virtually zero ambiance.  To get there, we were led past an area being set up for what looked to be a wedding the next day.  There was a large flat screen display with what appeared to be a screen saver application displaying the name of a music station that was playing in the background.

The waitress did a great job of trying to make up for the stark setting with very cherry service but all her efforts couldn't overcome the poor quality in preparation of the food coming out of the kitchen.  Three of our party ordered the NY Steak.  These were served with garlic mashed potatoes and what was described on the menu as roasted asparagus.  The asparagus was boiled and all items on the plate were luke warm.  The first request to have the food heated to a more appealing temperature was met by the plates coming back with the ceramic hot but the food still only warm.  We gave up on getting everything hot and asked for a side of the potatoes HOT.  That worked and got those three thru the meal.  My wife complained that the steak seemed to have been freezer burned in that though it was indeed pink in the middle, it had a chalky texture and was dry.

The good news was that my salmon was perfectly done, making up partially for the luke warm fingerling potatoes.  The mixed vegetables were seasoned nicely though also luke warm.

We finished off with the berry cobbler and that was ok, but a bit on the sweet side.

They really need to figure out how to handle a larger than normal crowd or stick to their bar food gig that they actually do quite well.</Text>

<text>Wow has this property gone downhill. The exterior/parking is in such disrepair. The interior bathroom was so disgusting & smelly. I had the BBQ chicken salad which was also disappointing. The chicken was 'dehydrated' cubes on top of brown old lettuce. Ewww! I will not be returning!</text>< Gmap_id>

<rate>2<//rate><text>An ok "continental breakfast" here provided "free" to hotel guests (3 choices of cereal, coffee and a tiny muffin). But for the price of this hotel, it should have been a full spread with an omelette bar and bacon, pancakes and fruit. I've had better continental breakfasts at cheap Howard Johnsons hotels. Pretty disappointing.</text>< Pictures>

Everything looks nice, and the staff were nice, but the overpriced, average quality food was enough for me to think we should’ve just gone to a cheap diner in Santa Cruz.

My only criticism for the service is that everything felt too rushed. They weren’t packed or empty, but our waitress was always in a hurry. Fast service is usually better, but not so fast that you only have time to take the order, and are walking away when someone is trying to ask something they didn’t even have the chance to ask.

I ordered an $11 prawn cocktail as an appetizer. It ended up coming with all the other food at 1 time. It was 5 ice cold prawns on a plate with 3 pieces of lettuce and a cocktail sauce dipping cup.

None of the quality lived up to the look or price of the place. Go to an average diner and get the same or better quality for cheaper.<//review>

Cool place if you're staying in the Inn at Pasatiempo. Kind of a weird location to get to if you're coming from the south, but plenty of parking and a decent menu. A bit pricey for the food quality, but fine if you want something close to your hotel room.</review>

<text>Maybe the best kept secret comfort food Happy Hour in Santa Cruz—half off apps and these are not dainty plates. My two faves are the giant Wedge Salad and Pulled Pork Potato Skins that are baked, not fried. Giant burgers, and a full entree menu make this the place to sit and wait out that Hwy 17 traffic.</text><Gmap_id>0x808e4044b5d0d5d1:0xe861b93b14e964b6</Gmap_id><Date>1541745944592<//Date>< pictures>

This is where breakfast is also served to hotel guests. However, the guests seemed to have few selections to choose from. Any guest silently complained about it over but never really brought it to anyone's attention when I was there. I really hope they do something about this though, it wasn't very much that was offered at all.

Overt priced garbage. It's intended for seniors and anyone else is regarded as outsiders. Extremely expensive,  with little to no service. Players are left in the window and get cold. Avoidance is a must here</Review>

<rating>5</rating><review>My wife and I went here on a recommendation. Our usual goto place is a well respected top tier restaurant on the other side of town. I do not want to name the other place because this place is much much better. When we arrived we were sat down in less than a few moments. Our server was Noelle. She was spot on and very quick and attentive.This continued even when the restaurant filled up. Her service never wavered no matter how many people were at her tables. True professional and her only concern was  with the tables she was serving. Top notch customer service from her and all the wait staff.
We ordered two of the appetizer specials. Wow the Salmon balls and the artichoke hearts were to die for!!! This was the first indication that whomever was in the back cooking was something special.  Then the main dishes came out. My prime rib was perfect. The asparagus was charred perfectly and the potatoes were the best. My wife had the surf and turf and again the chef out did himself. Ingenuity in every dish. We did find out his name was Ben Kralj. He also stepped outside his kitchen to say hi. That is one class act Ben. Thank you for that not every Chef takes a few moments to meet people. Class act.
I think those cooking shows you see on tv are below him. He would win and every one go home before the show started. Lets just hope Gordon Ramsey does not find out about him and steal him from SantaCruz..The back nine is a must visit. It is our new goto place in SantaCruz....</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Stick to the small dishes and appetizers. The true artistry of this place shines in the small dishes. Each piece of sushi and appetizer dish is unique and plated to perfection. By contrast, the hot pots and other staples fall flat, especially at the price point.<//text><date>1620528424308</date><Rate>4<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Starving at 9pm on Saturday night without a reservation.....
we arrive at Kappo Osen...
Alas,
They were busy and still fit us in at an indoor table.

Staff was awesome from the hostess and all the servers; great team work. Super attentive staff!

California roll: so good!!!
Wagyu gyoza were ok, Yakitori was delicious, Miso soup was spectacular!!!  We devoured the Keema dish and Chicken Nikomi and we wanted more. Green tea cake and black sesame ice cream, yum!
I can't believe we waited a whole year to eat here, dont wait, enjoy this bustling restaurant and everything they serve you, now!!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDArpFbDsK38hqCxES7tv4H8XzUDgtrPpWF5M0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhq8NEnf-0Qu_HO3DtaVBIBCuwyTXfWyeNH9k1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

Chirashi premium here wasn't atop a bed of rice, it was atop a pile of salad... a little weird and the fish cuts weren't up to the best in LA, but they were extremely generous portions.

If you're picky about your sushi you may wish to go elsewhere, but for a corner lunch place a few blocks away from the promenade, it's more than acceptable and they have ample outdoor seating.< /Text>

< review>
Not good Japanese food, over priced for the quality. I recommend if you are going to spend close to 100 per person. Go to a real Japanese restaurant like Matushisa, I get better fish and price about 100 per person. Ridiculous how expensive my meal was here. I just have to emphasize that if the price wasn't soo expensive and matched the quality of the food I would not complain. Both the quality and price was not justified.</review>

Food here is terrible, I'm surprised to see the high rating, and I guess most of them are written people who don't know what authentic Japanese flavor is.

Do not recommend if you're looking for authentic Japanese food. An analogy is, like Chinese food, if you like orange chicken, this is the place to go, otherwise, do not come to here!!!</text>

< Review>
A really impressive Japanese restaurant that will knock your socks off. Convinient location and fun exterior with a nice little photo op, it's easy to find and see from the street. It has the cutest little entryway the opens  into a really well decorated and furnished reception/dining area. They feature several different types of seating options  and the staff is extremely nice. Food quality is excellent as is the service. A lot of nice little added touches and amazing ambiance make this such a great place to dine. Menu selection is incredible as is the specials and sake selection.<//Review>

<text>We had the lunch sushi and it was outstanding. In particular the toro, the salmon and the shrimp head (fried) were fresh, tender and incredibly well dressed. Low key with great food is a great combination. Will be back for sure.<//text>< date>

< Review>
I had reservations on a Friday evening at 9pm so it was not the busiest time for dinner.  The food was delicious and the servers were attentive.  The biggest issue and complaint was the manager.  He made us wait for over 40 minutes without providing any courtesy updates, while proceeding to seat all other parties around us, including ones that arrived later than us and ones with no reservations.  He made sure to provide updates to all the other parties waiting to be seated except for us.  The only time I got an update was from a server.  It's a shame that such a classy establishment has such an unprofessional manager managing the restaurant.< /Review>

<review>Nice sushi restaurant in downtown Santa Monica. We got to sit in the special room with the slippers, was a nice ambiance. Ordered all sorts of sashimi, sushi, and rice bowls, everything was well cut and presented. Toro is worth asking the price for.</review>< UserId.>

I felt so nostalgic after visiting here. The food and ambiance reminded me so much of my travel abroad days in Japan. Food was so so so fresh! They were all so delicious but if I have to pick my top 3, they would be the tako carpaccio, tsukune and chanko nabe. Service was impeccable.</review>

Love this place! Every dish ordered was delicious. They have both Santa Barbara and Hokkaido Uni if you are a uni fan. Dishes to recommend: sushi Imamate, sashimi, black cod ( best I've had), matcha cake for dessert.
The place has traditional Japanese theme decoration, it's really pretty. Staff are all very friendly, know the menu and sake very well. Good for groups, dates or coming here by yourself.
Definitely coming back for more!< /Review>

<review>This place is the real deal! I cannot recommend more highly. I recently just had an office function (social distanced of course), and Kappo Osen catered it. They did such a wonderful job with the food and preparation. They always  serve the freshest fish around and pay attention to every detail. They threw in a ton of free appetizers and drinks as well, because the order was so large. Everyone at my office was raving about the food (black cod, chirashi, blue crab, steak). Please do yourself a favor and give this place a try. Nicest staff and best sushi in Santa Monica, bar none.< /review>< Pics>

Beautiful fresh sushi with fabulous vegan friendly options. Their spicy tuna w/ crispy rice is probably one of the best I’ve had. Their hot pots are perfection as is the service. Ambiance is really nice with a very Japanese feel. Intimate booths along the wall even have their own curtains for extra privacy- just a really cool setup. Definitely worth checking out- can’t wait to come back!!<//text>

This place is very cute! I liked how one of the area they give you slippers and have you sit to mimic a a traditional Japanese setting. Although they have a hole in th3 floor so you don't have to struggle sitting cross -legged.

The server was very knowledgeable with his recommendations. The fish and various dishes are all quality. Eating here takes me back to Japan. That's how I know a place is good.

They have a big selection and creative combinations like the cripy rice. I would definitely come here and some day try their omakase.< /review>

<Time>1578170931544</Time><review>Phenomenal experience. We had a large party and secured a reservation for a Friday night out. The overall look and presentation felt very sophisticated which hinted the food would follow suit, and it did! We indulged in a variety of appetizers, including the soft shell crab, and a salmon miso, all delictable.

The sashimi and sushi rolls 100% surpassed my expectations. I'll for sure be coming back to try their Omakasé and hopefully find a top notch itamae in the process. The hot pot(s) stole the show and topped us off and left us satisfied. I forgot to mention that they carry a very impressive sake selection.

Can't wait for my next return, aragato!</review>< response>

Some search for the food, some search for the music, some search for the aesthetics, and although these are merely in part, it is very rare that I would find something that resonates with my very soul. Something that is not in part, but in full.

This, is that place.

For the first time in my life, I have found something that holds the key of being intentional, led with discretion and privacy, held together by the beauty of establishment in kindness and consideration.

2. SETTING
Kappo Osen is like a person's soul. It holds different rooms for a different purpose. There are dog-friendly patio sections where you still feel the breeze of the nearby ocean while at the same time having blankets and heaters ready to balance the atmosphere. There are areas where it is more private and you can even take off your shoes and wear their special sandals they provide (of which each are new and you can even take home!) and you can reserve ahead of time. There are also bar areas and areas where you can sit down in front of the chefs. All are open to the public, it just depends on what type of experience you are looking for. The outer decor is more surrounded by images but the interior decor has multiple touches of beauty, from a samurai armor piece to the private at-home feeling with a bar section fit to welcome a lively party group. The music is fit for each occasion depending on the time of day, but I love how the volume isn't so loud; It allows for you to be present with other people while at the same time not being completely silent among conversation.

3. PRICE, QUANTITY, & QUALITY FOR PRICE
$50+ per person (Includes tip)

Depending on what you order, it can vary. If you don't eat much, with tip, it would probably be a minimum of $40, but if you truly want an overall experience, it will most likely result in about $80+ per person ($80 already includes tip). They do offer certain alcoholic drinks and items that can range in the $$$ range, it just depends on what the occasion is and what you're looking for. Don't let the portions of the food fool you. It may seem not as big but it is very filling; Think of many small dishes, multiple flavors with a very satisfying experience.

Reservations
Even though walk-ins are available, it is highly recommended that you make a reservation ahead of time, always. It can get VERY busy here, with a wait time of 40 minutes to 2 hours. It is noted that many people will be willing to wait because they know it's worth it, so again, make reservations.
If you have a party of about 10 - 12 people, you can reserve it ahead of time, given that you make a down payment, so as to make everything run smoothly. I love this area in particular because it has closing blinds for privacy; It gives the experience, a taste of Japan.

D. It is HIGHLY suggested to save room for dessert. Their dessert menu is limited but elite in overall experience, as I found this part of the course, most exciting and the most memorable. I ordered the matcha cake with green tea ice cream. It was PERFECT. 5/5. 10/10/ 100/100

5. FINAL THOUGHTS
Kappo Osen is a wonderful place for being present; Whether it be for a special date, business, a group of friends, or catching up with a friend after a long time of not seeing them. It represents aesthetic intentionality, privacy, and creates an atmosphere where you can be fully present. This is, my very heart, a finished portrait and the fullness thereof.< /text><user_name>Brian Vasquez< /user_name></record>

Your experience at Kappo Osen will much depend on how and what you order. If not careful, you may order well over and eat $100 in food per person, and are likely to not perceive value relative to a $300-400 bill for two. On the other hand, you can also spend less than $100 after alcohol, taxes and tips, and be happy with the outcome. I’m trying to say that the food is good, but not great. The presentation, however, is excellent.< /Text>

We love Osen and had been going to their location in Silverlake when we lived over there. We have been calling in orders to pick once a week during quarantine and they have been so nice and including delicious extra food each time. Everything is great here and I highly recommend it!<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Wow! One of the best meals ever! Went for the omakase premium and enjoyed a nice bottle of sake with it. We chose to sit at the sushi bar so we could be right in the action! This restaurant has a clean , traditional Japanese style and the service was impeccable. Queenie was our server and she  was very knowledgeable and attentive to our needs. Do yourself a favor and try the Uni from Hokkaido, it was so fresh and deLicious, not even the live uni you get in Santa Barbara fish markets can compare. You honestly cant go wrong here, everything we tried was top-notch and we were blown away with the variety of options they have on offer. THIS IS THE NEW KING OF SUSHI IN WEST LA. We are lucky to have this place, why are you still reading...just go see and taste for yourself.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Want to feel like you're in Japan for the night? The way they decorated this place will make you feel like you're there without going through TSA. They offer a couple private rooms where you take your shoes off and sit on the floor. The fish was fresh and have they good options for hot pot dishes. I recommend starting with the spicy tuna on crispy rice and the crab wrapped in tuna. They have some great beers on tap served ice cold.<//text>

Food was decent, but during the middle of the meal a young female manager(?) In a blazer came and asked if our friend was coming (we were a group of 4 and another friend was joining us soon) and if we could leave because there are people waiting in the middle of our meal. By that point we already ordered over $500 worth of food and drinks and was appalled. Didn't ask if we wanted the check or where our friend was or anything else. Just straight up asked if we could leave. They also included gratuity with the bill even though we were a party of 5 and then asked for additional tip. Server was polite but management was an absolute mess.< /text>

The food is amazing. Super traditional Japanese food is available for lunch. Their seasonal plate gives you rice, soup, veggies and more. Love the service and the quality.

Eat here regularly and plan to keep coming back.</Review>

<Review>We just ordered delivery and couldn’t be happier. The quality of the fish is great and the portions are plentiful. I loved that they included miso soup and edamame with the order. The rice is brown rice, which I thought I wouldn’t appreciate but I loved it. Also 1 order of nigiri means 1 piece. Just know that when you order. We were very happy with our meal and will order again.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2a5b563b4c545:0x49a450ff66b602e8</gmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_name>Melissa Alexander<//user_name>< resp>

The most authentic japanese food in Santa Monica. I have lived in Tokyo for 12 years and I know what it should taste like. This one is real. This means not only the food is amazing, but the staff and atmosphere here are very japanese. Also, compared to other japanese restaurants it is very reasonably priced. You can eat and leave full spending just $20.</text>

The Service: The staffs are very welcoming. All of them are very professional and efficient, especially my server, David! The general manager, Kevin, definitely has a great team!!

The Food:

Blue Crab Uni Bowl - good to share because you don't want to get full with the rice. It is just the "starter"

Hamo Karaage - thin eel fried with tempura dressing. very crispy and it goes so well with the light dressing.

Sea Bass skewer - Super tender. The sauce is not overly sweet.

Sushi - Super fresh!! The tuna just melted in my mouth. (BTW, the sushi chefs are really Japanese!)

Ginko Nut - my first time trying grilled ginko nuts. Very interesting texture.

Scallop - prepared perfectly! Love the size for appetizer.

They are indeed using great ingredients!

Can't end the meal without something sweet.

Dried persimmon w/ cream cheese, Macha ice-cream & macha cake. My favorite has to be the persimmon!! Great combination with the cream cheese.

The Parking: Valet parking ($10) and Street Metered ($2.5 per hour) 3 hour limit till 9pm.< /Review>

Beautiful property. Small staffing just be mindful of time. Still give yourself more time just in case they are low on staff. I don't drink but the gentleman at the bar/snack table is worth the visit. He is in his 70's and can teach us all better customer service skills. Best to you all.<//text>

Great facility, friendly people. Super easy to navigate around BUT parking is incredibly expensive. On a side note, if you need a ticketing agent it can be hard to find somone as they are not at the desk so plan ahead. All in, it took me about 20 minutes from parking my vehicle to my gate.<//text>

<Text>The airport is very nice and clean and 99% of the people that work there are awesome. The only problem like all problems is this one hispanic female who takes her job way too seriously and makes everyone miserable. It’s ironic though that everyone else is helpful and nice and they’re all white except the rude tsa female who is not.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

I used to be able to check my bags through to my final destination and now I have to go get them at my transfercairpirt and check them in all over again. What a waste of time and frustrating especially on international flights.</Text>< pics>

My favorite donut shop in Stockton. They're incredibly friendly, welcoming, and the donuts are so soft that it's impossible to have just one. They also make glorious breakfast sandwiches that smell heavenly, and their coffee is incredible! Perfect for dunking an apple fritter in. This place has been around for a while, and it always brings back wonderful memories for me. I recommend them for sure! Make sure to grab yourself one of their frappes, if you're into that sort of thing.<//review>

Best Donuts 🍩  in town!!!!! Delicious and soft stay fresh for days unlike other places, I recommend to try at least once. It will have you coming back again and again! I personally can't get enough, the customer service is always good that's a plus.< /review>

Loved the cookie shake. Great variety of donuts. They used to be 24hr but recently changed their schedule. Other than that i enjoy this place. There is a fair amount of beggers in this area but depends on the time of day.<//Text>

<user_id>103129280558404223021</user_id><review>Really enjoyed this place. We were picking out donuts for breakfast prior to going bowling down the street, they have a deal of buy 8 get 2 free. We made our choices and then I saw the apple fritters, I had to have 2 of those, that took us up to 12 donuts and when you buy 12 donuts, you get 3 free, so we ended up leaving with 15 donuts. The owner was so funny during our antics of picking 15 donuts, and patient.

The donuts were all excellent except I didn't particularly like the jam filled.

We will make a trip back there again.<//review>< Time>

Their good donuts but i hate for the fact they are over charging and they keep messing up your money if you pay $20 bill like you won't exactly get all your change back so keep your eye open. Anyways i wouldn't come back to this place anymore (Stockton)<//Text>

I was on my way to work and stopped by here to pick up some doughnuts for staff.  First time I've tried these guys and I must say they are very good!  I ordered a dozen doughnuts (they give you a baker's dozen) and a breakfast sandwich. Good fresh doughnuts and sandwich. I would recommend you try this place.< /review>

The ONLY reason that this isn't a five star review is one of the workers charged me for a custard filled maple bar but forgot to put the filling inside. Other than that I just love the donuts and the coffee, and the staff is always friendly, yes even at 4:30am!<//Text>

<date>1499313456641< /date><Rate>4< /Rate><review>Pros: Friendly staff, good selection (thank you, good filling is so hard to find!), good donuts. Cons: The colored frosting on the cake donuts left a bad after taste (from the flavoring?) and the donuts were a tad greasier compared to other places. Overall a great place to get a donut, I will return!< /review>< pictures>

I really got a great deal for two dozen donuts for less than $9 a box. The service was very nice but they were normal tasting donuts nothing special. The usual bear claws, plan apple fritters, chocolate and unglazed donuts. Going back to Krispy Creams. I gave this place a try because a nice employee from Raley's referred me here. I wasn't impressed. Also, a great advantage is their open really early in the morning.< /review>

<Text>I called 20 minutes before they closed and told them I was on my way and asked if they had doughnuts. The lady told me they did. So I got there 9 minutes before they closed and she had closed the door already and told me sorry. We are closed. For that reason they have lost a good patron. Horrible customer service.<//Text></record>

<review>The grilled cheese was excellent! Definitely worth the bit of a wait as they make everything fresh. They get their bread from the Acme bread company so you know that's gonna be good. The pickles were excellent as well. Definitely try this place out if you're a grilled cheese fan!</review></record>

We went with their special of the day which was a butternut squash grilled cheese. It was phenomenal as were the pickles that came with it.

The cheese was soft and gooey with great flavor. It came with several types of cheeses on it.

Luckily they have a few seats and we were able to snag one to enjoy our sandwich.

If you love grilled cheese, this place is for you!<//text>< Pics>

<rate>4< /rate><review>We were only in town for one day, but at least our cruise ship gave up plenty of time - 8a-11p. Plenty of time to explore with our San Fran friends! Fellow elite, Ms. S. is a fan of this place and introduces me to this place. It was a refreshing and easy walk from our cruise port and the perfect place to grab a breakfast sandwich.

Goat Cheese and Seasonal Jam - Simple and nice. Soft bread and bold flavors. 3/5

Cheesey Bacon Breakfast Sandwich - Amazing! Served on a longer loaf and cut in half - this thing was pretty huge. More importantly, it was absolutely dripping with gooey cheese! Add bacon and things only get better. This was definitely 5/5.

Blueberry Milk - Pretty straightforward. Blueberry flavored milk. Not overly sweet or thick, it was just right. 3/5< /review>< resp>

Pricey. Got the grilled cheese of the day which was sundried tomato with Italian herbs $9.75. Not worth it. Simply tasted like pizza. Had to wait in a line. Also, weekend raclette is not a thing anymore. It’s weekdays raclette now. Said it was because of the overflowing crowd on weekdays due to their raclette 🤷🏻‍♀️< /Review>

Our first time in the Ferry Building. We both got grilled cheese and tomato soups. Friendly staff, not a long wait for food, and we were lucky enough to snag a few seats in front so we can sit and eat. The food was great, bread was the perfect amount of crunchy but not burned. Cheese was really good.</text>

Good grilled cheese. A bit steep in price though, plus the staff for the longest time failed to acknowledge our presence, somehow.

The owner has to fix the credit card machine so patrons without cash at hand can still tip the staff. Then, the staff might, have more incentives to improve their service.<//text>

Grilled cheese was good...waited 25 minutes for it. In the first 20 minutes not a single order was set-out. Went back recently and they decided to close an hour earlier than advertised. So if you don't mind waiting, or if you have an option B go for it.< /Text>

This has got to be one of the best grilled cheese i have ever eaten in my life. I got their grilled cheese of the day with turkey and it is amazing. They have their artisan cheese shop right beside and they source their ingredients locally in the farmers market. Great service, amazing food, will definitely come back here again.</Review>

<text>This is the "sister shop" to Cowgirl Creamery (read: they use their cheeses and such). IT'S AMAZING. Seriously, some of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had- both cheese only and with meats (try them all). Location (ferry building) can't be beat and the prices are good considering the quality. Large (and unique) drink selection too!< /text></record>

The crazy artisan grilled cheese are amazing.  I had the three cheese grilled cheese and it did not disappoint.  I was actually very surprised how great the sandwiches are.  I have walked by this places so many times in the past and thought they just sold cheese, man was I wrong.  I also sampled the chocolate milk, and you can't beat the taste of all organic mike and chocolate put together in one cup.  I will definitely go back here to sample the rest of the menu.<//Review>< Pics>

I like their cheese shop so when this opened up next door I was delighted. This serves some great cheeses featured next door but also some other treats you should not miss. I have had an earl grey creme brulee and it was great. It is nice to see how the cheeses they have are featured cooked in items.

If you want a bite in the ferry building this is a place you should look at.</Review>

<Text>A good stop if you need a snack to refuel while out sight-seeing. This place has a bar for you to stand at while you eat. The menu consists of several dairy delights, including specialty milk drinks and cheese dishes. I thoroughly enjoyed the grilled cheese with turkey, and the cheese plate is a great deal for the gourmet cheeses they provide. Drinks are a tad over priced.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Soooo good!

The last time I was at the Ferry Building, I dipped next door's Acme Bread's scallion bread into Cowgirl's fresh sheep ricotta, while sitting on a bench looking out at the bay.

I came with high hopes because I love grilled cheese and my daughter wanted a chocolate milk. The service was extremely rude. I asked if I could have the smallest chocolate milk size for my young daughter, and the employee just stared at me looking annoyed. A little miffed, I thought the food would be good. But it was thrown together and practically shoved in my arms at the counter in the rudest way. They weren't even busy! The food was mediocre. Never again!</Text>

Love their grilled cheese sandwiches. Sometimes the bread can seem a little dry, but the other ingredients more than make up for it. They change the ingredients weekly so I never get bored of it. Good for a quick bite to eat. A little expensive, but so is everything in the Ferry Building.</text>

<Review>I love cheese. I love simple things. I always liked this stall when I walked in the Ferry Building.
So how could this place go wrong?

I don't mind paying $10 for a sandwich if it's quality and filled with ingredients.. but that wasn't the case here. I mean, they did use quality bread and cheese. The thing is, there was BARELY ANY CHEESE.
There was only like A LAYER of cheese and maybe like one slice of meat.... I expected more for a place that specializes in cheese. No ooey gooey magic factor when you think of a grilled cheese sandwich..

If you love high quality cheese, you will love the Cowgirl Creamery and their next door Sidekick Cafe & Milk Bar. I have a fondness for their artisan grilled cheese sandwich specials of the day.

During the Saturday Farmer's Market, you can order ooey gooey melted cheese on toast carved from a wheel of cheese melted under a hot heating lamp. Pricey but delicious!< /Text>

<Text>Habit forming - proceed with caution.  If you want to learn about cheese and try before you buy this is a fantastic option.  Tell them what you want to do with it and they will find you the perfect cheese for your taste and application.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Came here to grab some food on a Saturday along with a number of other places.

1. Grilled cheese with pancetta 10
~Delicious. Possibly the best grilled cheese I've ever had. Perfectly toasted Acme bread with salty pancetta, hot, gooey cheese, and some side pickles. Jesus.

Service was pretty good.<//Review>< pics>

I saw a woman walking through the Ferry Building with a plate of cheesy yum and I demanded she tell me where it came from. She complied and pointed me in the direction of Cowgirl Creamery. We began to walk through the store, and then spotted "the Sidekick" next door.

A man with a really big ball of cheese and a large unit for heating it stood out front of Sidekick. It was kind of unclear how to obtain a plate, but I eventually figured out there were two places to order and pay, one on either side of the man. It was a short wait for the food after we ordered. My husband and I each had the melted asiago cheese on bread. ("Weekend Raclette - $5.95)

The cheese was wonderful, the bread was kind of soggy. It was really messy and hard to eat, but it was good. A few pickled veggies were served on the side.

I'd probably try something else next time we came, but it wasn't disappointing</review>< Rate>

<review>We hung out at the Ferry building one beautiful Saturday and got really yummy food at the Farmers' Market outside.  We decided to do some shopping inside and ended up walking by.  I spotted something strange look as we walked passed and decided to go by for a 2nd look.  This was very interesting in deed.  They had half a wheel of cheese under a heat lamp.  You order the Wagon Wheel and they take some crusty bread and scrap a layer of melted cheese on top.  It was cool to see, but even better to eat</review>< pics>

Honestly disappointed sorry to say as I'm a fan of the brand.  Love their cheeses and also fan of Strauss dairy.   10 bucks for mostly bread and u wait an inordinate amount of time for a not stellar product.  The drinks from the milk bar however are very good.  The people working here seem very unhappy.</Text>

I frequent Cowgirl Creamery and this was my first time at Sidekick.  I ordered the cheese toasties, which is an open faced grilled cheese with Cabot Clothbound Cheddar, caramelized onions and maple mustard.  It was warm, goeey, savory and sweet!  Though I was full, I wish it came with a side salad.

It can get crowded, especially on the weekends.  So if you're hangry, be prepared to wait.< /review>

The sidekick is a mini storefront that deals mainly in milk based beverages and some serious grilled cheese sandwiches. The beverages are quite tasty, and I tried a few of them, which included the raspberry spritzer thing, a cafe au lait, and one of the chocolate based bevs. All of them were fantastic. The sandwiches were good, buttered grilled bread with fantastic cheese and some meat inside. More of a quality over quantity when it comes to the filling, I had no complaints wolfing them down as the denizens of the Ferry Building's shopping habit swarmed around us.
The staff was just super friendly, which isn't uncommon in San Francisco, but it was absolutely pleasant having them be a part of my experience here.< /Text>

<review>The cheese grits with a poached egg and pancetta might not be to everyone's tastes (as a Canuck, it's not something I see very often) but it grew on me. I think they use a sharp cheddar, which gives the grits good flavour, and the egg was poached perfectly.

I've also enjoyed their burrata salad at lunch; there's a healthy dose of burrata, which plays well with the salad's asparagus and green beans. Whether you're grabbing something en route to a ferry, or want to people watch in the busy corridors of the Ferry Building, this is a good place to do so.</review>< user>

<Review>The cafe-style extension of local Cowgirl Creamery, known as Sidekick Cafe & Milk Bar, is situated prominently on the corner adjacent to the Creamery's Ferry Building cheese shop, in the center of the promenade, and serves fresh milk, several varieties of cheeses  to suit anyone's tastes, and all manner of other dairy-based treats.  The grilled cheese with pancetta is strongly suggested, offering all of the intense saltiness of Italian bacon paired with the creaminess that comes with a locally-sourced, fresh cheese of your selection, grilled and melted to perfection.

Other dairy products include a rich, creamy, decadent chocolate mousse and an Earl Grey Tea panna cotta that any desert-lover would enjoy.  If you want fresh, wholesome, locally-sourced ingredients, prepared with comfort food in mind, you've found another great place in San Francisco...< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>Warm and hearty sandwiches in the heart of the Ferry Building from legendary (and neighboring) Cowgirl Creamery. Grab a grilled cheese to go or snack hard at the standing tables and limited "bar" seating. Chase your sammy down with an egg cream or fizz or just a glass of cold milk. If you have a sweet tooth, try the Earl Grey panna cotta (the "chocolate" was too coffee-like for me) or get a steamed hot chocolate recchiuti.< /text>< Gmap_id>

Sure, there are probably a lot of options in San Francisco if you want a grilled cheese, but not many of them are as memorable as the Sidekick Cafe & Milk Bar. Located in the Ferry Building and next door to Cowgirl Creamery, the sandwich artisans whip up some pretty delectable dairy products for the famished passerby. Our group munched on the grilled cheese special of the day with goat gouda (um, yes!), gruyere and fromage blanc. I tried it with and without Pancetta and both were gooey with crisp bread and a sweet and spicy relish of some kind that really made the sandwich. My chai milk tea wasn't huge on the flavor, but the friendly service was a huge win. We ended our dairy feast with some chocolate panna cotta. Holy goodness was that little snack a good one! Rich and thick with a smooth and creamy texture, don't miss this little hidden treat on your next visit.<//review>

Very little cheese in the grilled cheese. Pretty disappointing for a 12$ grilled cheese with just pickles.</Text>

(Translated by Google) A shop we have been doing since morning. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel so I came to eat.
There was only a cheese shop, it was a thick and delicious sand.
Both are delicious, but a warmer sandwich is recommended!

朝からやっているお店。ホテルで朝食をつけなかったので食べにきました。
チーズのお店なだけあって、濃厚で美味しいサンドでした。
どちらも美味しいけど、温かい方のサンドウィッチの方がオススメ！</Text>

(Translated by Google) A shop near the entrance. Sand with melted blue cheese, mushrooms and scrambled eggs. The inside is olive oil and oily, but it's delicious!

My car had a lot of damage from an accident(not my fault). AAA sent me here, as it is a 5 star or highly rated business for them. After I picked up my car(Dec), I noticed it made a lot of “clunking” noise.  I was unable to take it back due to Covid but did call and  took it back in Jan.  Ozzie handled my case and had it looked at it, drove it, and they told me they heard nothing .  I said ok, thinking maybe I’m crazy.  I put the car in storage and removed it from storage in late April.  What do I hear?  The “clunking” noise.  I took my car to a mechanic and as soon as he took a drive with me, he heard the noise.  Identified it and to be sure, put it up on the lift to be certain.  I guess everything was fixed except the strut. So now I’ve paid for an independent inspection that should have been done to begin with.  I called twice and have left a message and it has not been returned.  I will definitely not do business here again.< /Review>

< Review>
Somebody hit the rear bumper of my cadillac. I wanted a new bumper but instead did a really great job repairing the bumper and as well as the dent of the bumper, looks brand new as if I just bought the car out of the dealership. The staff was great and communicative. And answered all my questions. Would really recommend this place to anyone who gets into a really bad car accident or whoever got a hit and run. Ozzie was the one who was working on my car and finished less than three days! (The picture is before, cannot provide the after)< /Review>

He constantly communicated with me about progress,issues and delays related to getting parts etc. There was some delays related to getting parts to fix my truck,  but nothing was hidden from me everything was transparent.Shannon  worked with his team to solve the problem without sacrificing quality of the replacement parts. Top notch customer service and very accommodating I was very satisfied and impressed with the process.</review>< Pics>

I was looking for a place that would make sure I was able to get the best from the insurance & to ensure my car would look exactly the same before the accident.  Malinda Cabal was a great service advisor & made sure my car was good as a new! I would highly recommend to others to get any type of service done here.

I highly recommend Caliber Collision in National City, The staff is very professional, polite and fast. I had a minor side view mirror repair that required re-paint and an install. The repair was minor, but most places around the area had a long timeline for completion. Understanding the workload, The service advisor Malinda Cabal went the extra mile and quickly turned-around the repair. She was professional and thorough in her assessment of the repair. I was appreciative of her efforts, I'm sure there were more pressing issues to address than my minor repair but she acted swiftly. Thanks to Malinda and her great team at Caliber Collision< /text>

I was referred to the National City location by a friend that had recently had their vehicle repaired there. I went in for a quote after receiving several other quotes from other competitors. The cost for the repair was better compared to the others but my decision factor was based of their professionalism and knowing the quality of their work. I felt no pressure from them at all!! Best decision ever made. Will definitely refer them to anyone that needs to use their services.</review>

I was rear ended and went to caliber collision for repairs at this location and left COMPLETELY satisfied. I absolutely love the work that was completed and especially the process during the repairs. RICARDO was so communicative during the whole process and I could not be happier with the end result and the customer service. Thank you so much for your service Caliber Collision and RICARDO!!! :-)<//Review>

Caliber collision repainted my doors after another body shop did a bad repair and paint job. Color match is perfect compared to the previous repair. Excellent customer service, kept informed of every step in the repair process. Car delivered sooner than expected. Great shop, highly recommended.<//Text>

I had to come to caliber collision when someone sideswiped my car, my insurance company had a representative onsite at caliber, they were so inviting and helping, even gave me water and coffee and SNACKS, for the very short time I waited. The folks at caliber collision took car of my every need and even offered to drop me off at the car rental place. Hey really do go above and beyond when it comes to customer service. I will definitely be returning for any other issue that come my way! Thank You Caliber Collision!<//review>

The employees at  National City Caliber Collision are always polite and know their jobs. Have had my car repaired a few times, they have always been professional and my car was ready when I was told it would be.  They work well with my insurance company to get me driving again.<//Review>

I was so Pleased and Happy with all the help David Luna gave me to explain what repairs my car needed, he called in the afternoon the day I dropped it off. It was an experience anyone with an Accident Repair need will be glad that Caliber Collision was recommended. They really do Restore the rhythm of your Life in a timely fashion.<//Text>

Avoid this shop. There are better Caliber Collisions who will fully fix your car without the hassle.

Update: Car Shop never fixed my car all the way and stiffed me for a rental bill they agreed  to pay for. Can't even trust the shop owner..</Text>

I had to have my car repaired after someone sideswiped my car on the freeway.  While that was stressful enough that was not the case for getting the repairs done at Caliber Collision on Haffley Ave.  The reason being I had the great opportunity to have Alma Hernandez handle everything for me.  She did the initial estimate.  She made arrangements for me to get a rental car.  She kept me up to date on how the repairs were being handled and she did this numerous times.  She was always willing to answer any questions I might have.  I really appreciate her calm manner and patience with me.  When my car was ready to be picked up Alma went over everything that was done and explained any details about how to take care of the fresh paint, so as not to undo the beautiful paint.  The repairs were done perfectly.  I couldn't be any happier with Caliber Collision because of Alma Hernandez.  She made the whole process worry free.< /review>

Hands-down the best body-shop service ever! Gus & Fernando ensured each of my concerns was addressed in a professional and timely manner.  The workmanship was flawless.  After taking time off work and getting the rental car shuttle routine, it was an absolute pleasure doing business with Michelle at the front desk.  She and her co-workers understand the things that can frustrate a customer and they do an EXCELLENT job of making everyone feel welcome.  It was rare to experience that kind of personalized service but I'm glad I went to Caliber!  Won't go anywhere else!< /review>

Customer service was on point. Was recommended to go here and I can guarantee that they don’t want to finish a car without making sure it’s 100% good. If you’re in a wreck or any accident, go here.< /text>

First of all, the customer service is fantastic. They call every Tuesday and Thursday to update you and never forget.they take care of their cars and you can tell they know what they are doing. This is my second time going to them and I am just as satisfied as the first. A little pricey, but worth it for what you are getting in return. They even cleaned my car and deoxidized my headlights when it wasn't busy.< /review>

My brand new front Pirelli tires were switched out for some no-name worn tires. When you check in your vehicle make sure you note with the estimator the brand and condition of your tires. Otherwise the work was outstanding and done on time.< /review>

The service was amazing ! But when I got my car back .... My change was all gone . I know what I leave in my car ... But there was about $4-$5 in change . My fault for leaving it there but I mean I trusted it to still be there when I got my car back . Oh well I guess . Wouldn't mind coming back again in the future if anything happens but just wouldn't trust leaving anything in there .< /Review>

I'm always worried when it comes to painting service.. For a car or a house. I've been painting houses since 1987 and have worked at many body shops that restored classic cars. Hats off to Caliber..<//Review>

They answered all my questions, didn't make me feel like they were doing me a favor.  They took pictures of my car, and the process took under 15 minutes.  Very corteous staff, and got in contact with my insurance right away.  In short, loved it.< /text>< Pictures>

Geico sent me to Caliber Collision after some kid hit the front of my Nissan Armada. The car had front end damage, bumper, wheel, and frame.  I sent the car here because of the "lifetime guarantee" and being Geico's preferred shop I figured this was going to be an easy deal. What a mistake I made bringing the car here.

First off when I got the car back, I immediately noticed three major problems.  The repair monkey did not even bolt the bumper to the frame of the vehicle.  There are two large bolts to hold this in and one was missing after repair. I pointed this out to the tech and he scratched his head and said, "...hmm yeah I see that."  Then the wheel well plastic liner separating the tire from the car was completely broken and they did not fix this either.  I again pointed this out. The tech said, "...yeah I see where it is broken.". With the wheels straight you can tell the steering wheel is 30 degrees off. Obviously they didn't do any alignment after the job. The manager came out and told me he would talk to the quality control tech. I highly doubt there is one, if so it has to be a monkey in overalls, he may or may not have a wrench.

After this, I took the car to a competitor of these guys in Chula Vista to have the work verified. Immediately the other shop noticed three more problems I did not and pointed them out in about five seconds.  The fender was never fixed, there are cracks where they attempted to pull it straight I was told. They did not paint or repair another section, and the entire bumper was not set correctly and was off by about an inch. After removing the bumper I was shown more problems, pieces that were cracked and not repaired, as well as the shoddy workmanship of the mounting.

I notified Geico about what has happened. Geico has told Caliber to pay the other auto body company for the repairs. I made sure to document as much as possible. They also took lots of pictures.

I would never take a vehicle to these guys if you want it fixed properly. These guys are absolute knuckleheads at best. I do not understand how they are in business with Geico. I would bet that the happy people writing reviews know absolutely nothing about the quality of their work and I also bet that if these people had a professional look at their work it would be a different story. I believe they have a deal with Geico to fix their cars as fast and as cheap as possible so that they push customers through without having to really repair vehicles correctly.

I also understand why they will not let you take your car without signing their release form in which you agree to binding arbitration in the event you have a dispute with them. This way when you find out how bad their work is you cannot sue them in court.  Lucky for me I can still file a lawsuit against Geico.

Bottom line is if you want to avoid having a major problem take your car elsewhere, their "lifetime guarantee" doesn't matter if your car is not repaired properly in the first place.  I would not listen to Geico either if they try and send you here. Good luck do your research first.</text>

As a woman who has been taken advantage of and overcharged by places like Jiffy Lube and Pep Boys in the past, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND JOEY'S AUTO SERVICE.  This is the spot.  Stop looking for a better mechanic because Joey is the better mechanic.</review><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

They are AMAZING!!! Always helpful, very honest and affordable, totally reliable,  and a fast turn around in time.

When I got in a accident and couldn't move my car he came to my house and got it.

When my husbands a/c went out he took it to another guy and try to tell me he needed more parts then he needed. I bought told my husband let's take it to Joey to finish up the job. Joey told me we didn't even need the parts and saved me $400.

When getting new tires the tire store did a alignment and I litterally had to take it back 3x because it was still off. Called Joey and he looked at my car to make sure nothing else was wrong with the steering and didn't even charge me.

When i tried to change my own sparks plugs, the 3rd one I couldn't even un due it so I moved on to the 4th one, pulled it out and oil was all over it. Frantically I called Joey and he told me to put it back in and come right over. Fixed my oil seal leak, cleaned everything up and finished up the rest of my spark plugs and only charged me for the oil seal.

Once you go to Joey's Auto you'll never need to find another mechanic again!</review>

This review is a long time coming. Joey is great! He let me bring my car over the same day that I called and even offered me a ride home. He quickly identified the the reason for the banging sound coming from the bottom of my 2006 Nissan Xterra. He changed out the front right, upper and lower ball joints and control arm for a far more reasonable price than I was offered elsewhere. He even offered to clean up my corroded battery as a gift. It has been about 6 months now since he worked on my car and I haven’t had a single banging sound or issue. I now have his number saved in my phone and whenever I or a friend have car issues he is our go to.<//text>

Joey and his team are great! They've helped me with standard maintenance, oil changes, tires, brakes, and more advanced maintenance like changing belts, and diagnosing issues like oil leaks. They are very nice, communicate well, and really know the business of fixing cars and getting you back out on the road as soon as possible. I will keep going back to Joey's Auto Service whenever we need help with our cars and trucks, and have no problem referring friends and family to them as well. Thanks Joey and team for a great job every time!<//text>

Have known Joey for many years.  Always upfront with prices and what he thinks the car NEEDS.  No overselling, I actually once asked him to replace something and he told me it didnt need it.  Much  respect since I know nothing about cars.  Would trust him with any recommendation.< /review>

They are always straightforward and clear about the repair as well as the time frame needed to complete  it. We have known Joey for 37 years and have trusted  him with every car we have ever had. His honest evaluation about your repairs set him apart from other repair shops. Jay as well as his other assistants make his shop the best.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>This is my go-to shop for repairs. They are incredibly knowledgeable and efficient. We have 3 cars in the family - 2014 Nissan Maxima, 2004 BMW 3 series and a Mercedes E320. I Had some complicated running issues with the BMW and they saved me a lot of money by accurate diagnosis and repair. I always have my cars serviced/repaired here and they deliver every time! Great shop.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
Several times I’ve taken my car on maintenance and emergency services and Joey’s Auto Service never fails me.  As a single mother it is difficult to find an honest and reliable mechanic, Joey’s Auto Service is a gem and a keeper!!!

Two years ago my son took his GMC Denali to the dealer and told him he needs a new engine @ a tune of 10K.  I told my son to take it to Joey’s Auto Service and it only costs 2K (not for new engine but repairs only) and up to now still running.

I’m a happy & satisfied customer who will gladly recommend Joey’s Auto Service!!!

Joey & Jay - you guys are the BEST!!!< /Review>

When you need your car to be serviced, any car foreign or domestic bring it to Joeys. He will tell you upfront how much it cost and other recommendations to your vehicle. He’s worked on all my vehicles and couldn’t be happier. Will continue to bring my cars here and supporting local and small business.< /text>

<review>This place is a joke. Had a fuel line break and he said he couldn’t find the part but can fix it by himself. Got my car back a week later supposedly fixed. One day after driving it I woke up to gas all over my carport floor and my gas Spewing out on top of my engine. He never fixed the problem and when I contact him he said he would come get my car towed and fix it but never came and now is ignoring my calls and text.

Would give zero stars if I could but it recommended I put one.<//review>< pictures>

My family's car had died in In N Out parking lot on Beach Blvd. Joey's price for my alternator was not only the lowest, he picked me up and my Sequoia saved at least $80 for towing. Very professional and someone you can trust to do business again and again. My Sequoia is running great again. Thank you Joey!<//review>

<name>David Rock Tanaka</name><Text>I did some extensive research and was very fortunate to find an awesome mechanic. My classic 1991 Lexus LS400 has a very difficult wheel alignment issue and Joeys Auto did a great job the first time. In the past, other shops would say the wheel alignment was done until I drove a few miles and discovered my steering wheel was still cockeyed. Joey and his technicians must be perfectionists because my steering wheel has never been so level for years. It’s like new again! This is precisely why lifetime warranty wheel alignments are now a no-go for me, my life and my time are more precious than bad service and lots of pressure to perform unnecessary work. The other shop even told me they had to remove my steering wheel to make it level. Outrageous. Let Joeys Auto do a great job the first time. It’ll definitely put a smile on your face every time you drive your vehicle.

I also liked the way Joey only informed me about what my car needed and not overselling extras. He would say, “Save your money.” We had a very pleasant conversation and education with no pressure. Joey really does care for people. Now I know why so many customers love him so much. Thank you Joey for taking care of your customers like family.

<Review>Brought it in @ 9 am needing brake pads. Didn't want the squeak so also opted to have the rotors turned. Fair price (even cut me a better deal for paying cash). This is the 3rd car I've brought here for basic service. Always pleased with the price and the service is right (Plus I can walk home while they fix it). Recommended!< /Review>< Pictures>

Joey's Auto Service was BY FAR the best experience I have ever had.

I was also able to pick my car up late so I could have it as soon as possible. His prices where beyond fair for the high quality level of work and service I received.

I have been a loyal customer of Joeys for a while now and I would highly recommend Joey's Auto shop to anybody who needs their car repaired. Joey fixed and saved my car when I really needed it and he did awesome wonderful job fixing everything that needed to be fixed. Joey is always honest and told me up front exactly what needed to be done and how much everything would be. Joeys place is also are very affordable when compared with other Auto shops as well. If you need to get anything fixed on your car no matter what part needs fixing Joey will fix it for you. His place fixed my car for me and I don't know what I would  have done If hadn't found Joeys Place. Joey's Place was the best auto shop I ever used and did an excellent job on all my car repairs. If you need to have your car fixed just call Joey and he will take care of it for you. I give Joey's Auto Service Five Stars. Thanks Joey.</review>

We don't go to the dealer shop to fix our cars.  We go with JOEY'S AUTO SHOP!<//Review>

Joey is really such a sweetheart. He repaired my mini cooper in such a short time & was also generous enough to lend me a loaner car (his baby!) while I waited for the repairs to be done. His prices are better than fair (especially given the location of his shop) & he even helps with finances. If you pay in cash, he'll give you a discount (debit card doesn't count). He replaced & installed new windshield wipers & a fog light that went out -- free of charge! He'll really take care of you :) I would recommend all my friends with car problems to come check out Joey's shop. I'm already a repeat customer! A+ for service & A++ for being so genuine & straight up. Thanks Joey!!</review>

Highly recommend Joey's auto service, Joey and his team of mechanics are knowledgeable and thorough. I was very satisfied with the work they did on my car. Joey even called me few days after he fixed my car, to see if it was working okay.  He really cares about the service he provides and wants his customers to be satisfied.  I would rate him a 10.< /Review>

Joey's has taken care of all my cars for years. My car is about 8 years old now and they suggested I do the clay/wax. It takes about 6 hours but my car looks new/refreshed again. The headlights are crystal clear and my paint looks amazing. I went to go pick up the car and noticed a strange noise. He said just leave the car and they took care of it no charge, as it was just a dry belt that needed some TLC.< /Text>

Took my suspension here after neither I NOR a different shop could repack the strut assembly. They were able to not only get it back together properly, but also able to do some minor adjustments in the shocks.

I will be taking my car here from now on for repairs. If you have an e39 i can not recommend a place higher than this.</review>< pictures>

There is a saying, “That a good mechanic is worth his weight in Gold.” Well as someone with a deep mechanical background, but STILL can’t fix my own cars, I KNOW this statement is true. Joey Pascual is worth his weight in Diamonds. That is what he is – a Diamond of a Human Being. He cares about people and it starts from there.

Every estimate or repair he and his firm performs begins from the perspective that they are out to earn your trust  with honesty and integrity and make you not even think of taking your car elsewhere the next time maintenance, a smog certificate or repair is needed.

Compared to 95% of shops who look at you like their next victim for how much they can gouge you and overcharge you, possibly even performing unnecessary repairs to dramatically raise your bill – this is extremely rare! We have ALL experienced getting gouged by shops at one time or another.

I have seen Joey throw in small repairs for free just to prove he really cares about you and understands money has been hard to come by for some time now!
Joey stands behind his work 100% and you will never get a song and dance “IF” there is a defective part or something needs more attention after his repairs.

Joey is also great with loaners, trying his best to work one out for you, sometimes for free if possible.

I would never take my car anywhere else, and I have a classic 20 year old Lexus SC400 that is like my BABY!

Next time you need ANYTHING done to your cars, I strongly suggest you give Joey’s Auto Service a try – conveniently located on 19232 Beach Blvd.<//review>

<review>I definitely recommend Joey's Auto Service!
I'm from Long Beach and I've been a  customer of Joey's for the past 5 years now and this is the first time I will write a review towards all the services I got from his shop. Joey is surely honest and friendly and a person that you can trust as well as to those mechanics for their Excellent Workmanship on the job. He alway gives recommendations of repair and tells  me when they should be done instead of pushing it. More Power and Keep it Up!< /review>< pics>

Not sure where these reviews are coming from. Although I can only speak for only my own personal experiences, I've never had anything similar to what has been mentioned negatively.

Joey has been the mechanic for many of my vehicles whenever the unfortunate event would arise. Whenever I do not have time myself to take care of something, Joey has always been accommodating.

Recently, I have been having very bad leak on one of my Corvettes that is by no means stock nor the run of the mill variant when it comes to the parts on it.

I made the unfortunate mistake of trusting another shop from a neighboring city when it came to the power steering system.

A long story short, the power steering hose was improperly routed by the other shop, making the hose get pinched by the A-arm which eventually brought a bad leak and a leaking hose.

The hose was replaced promptly by Jay over at Joey's and he made sure that the hose wouldn't get in the way as best as possible. Jay is a very friendly and just as accommodating as Joey (which says a lot). He didn't cut any corners, nor did they try and nickle and dime me with some other services.

I recommend them, and have had nothing but positive experiences. He also replaced the motor in one of my other vehicles for a much better deal than the local dealership would.

The only thing that could be negatively said would be his phone answering capabilities.. The shop is incredibly busy pretty much all the time. I would be leery of any shop, high end or not, if they are not busy. Tells you a lot about a business.< /text>

Joey was very helpful and friendly when I came in to fix the brakes on my car. My father has been going to him for years and he has always had a great experience. I will certainly be returning to Joey for any other auto services.< /Text>

I will definitely recommend this shop to my family, friends and to everyone who needs any kind of service and repair with their vehicle.

The service they render is excellent and the price is really reasonable.

Thank you for taking good care of my car and I did the right decision of taking it to your shop .

I like joeys auto because they're reliable, fast, and they're honest with my car. I got an estimate from the dealer and they wanted to charge me $600 and when i went to Joey he only charged me $200. They even called me after to check up on how the repairs are.< /Review>

About a month ago I came in to Joey with my car that had been side swiped in a hit and run. Everyone I talked to quoted me much higher and told me it would take along time for reasons I truthfully couldn't understand, because I don't understand cars. Joey was honest and quoted me much lower than the competitors. On top of that he explained everything to me in an understandable manner.

On top of that he was considerate of my time constraint and said if he couldn't finish in time, he would let me use one of his cars until the job was done.

Finally, the work was phenomenal and professional, you couldn't tell at all that there was any damage done whatsoever. I highly recommend Joey as an honest auto mechanic.

I went to the "Joeys Auto Service" because an orange explanation mark sign did not disappear from the car's dashboard for about a month. Joey immediately helped me. He run a software and the mark disappeared. I would definitely come back to the shop in the future.< /Review>

I have taken my car to Joey's Auto Service for the last seven year. Joey has always done an outstanding job with tune ups, brakes, air conditioning, electrical and general engine repairs. His customer service is excellent and repair costs are reasonable and affordable. This guy relly knows his craft.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Amazing experience with Joey's. My girlfriend and I just moved here from New Orleans with over 1000 lbs packed into my sedan, and needless to say, my older car was a bit beat up from the move. He sat down with us and made sure to get an accurate history of the recent work done on the vehicle and told us he would treat us like his son and daughter. He did a complete review of my car and personally showed us what needed to be fixed. I really felt like he made accurate suggestions on what needed to be fixed, and he didn't try to suggest fixing other parts of the car that were still in good condition. It felt like when my dad, an independent farmer and mechanic all his life, looked over my vehicle prior to college. I will definitely be a returning customer.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Joey has been taking care of my car for over 5 years now ever since I moved to CA. I travel over 1 hour to get my car serviced each time. Recently, my 1999 car with almost 300,000 miles on it, broke down on the freeway in Pomona. It was late on a Friday afternoon and traffic was horrendous. I immediately called Joey. Although he was about to close the shop for the day, he accommodated me and waited for the tow truck to deliver my car to his shop that evening. That weekend Joey worked on my car to diagnose and fix the problem so that I would have my car back in time for the work week. I truly appreciate the time he has given to fixing my car and assuring my safety so that I can feel confident in driving my it again. Joey always goes above and beyond to ensure that he delivers excellent service.<//review>< name>

My family and I have been with Joey for years now. I have a much older BMW so it is bound to have its issue and this is the perfect place because they do specialize in BMW. Thank you Joey for the service over the years with my whole family. Joey is honest and not pushy; he never tries too hard to sell you his service. He tells you what's wrong, straight forward.
I also appreciate the fact that he does respond quickly, anytime I ask about anything regarding my car. Almost always, he sees our car right as we call him when there's a problem.
There have been many times where he himself has offered to come pick up when we(relatives) have not been able to make it to the shop. One time he drove to my house because I actually forgot to sign something LOL

Thank you Joey!!< /text>

<Text>Pending law suit against Joey auto repair shop!!!!  I had a terrible experience. I came to Joey auto service with my BMW 528i for a regular oil change. Unfortunately, it turned into a disaster. Joey did not perform the oil change correctly and my oil was leaking. I had an internal engine failure caused by Joey Auto Service. The cause of breakdown was due to an excessive oil leak from the oil filter housing O-ring, which was last touched by Joey auto shop. Joey used aftermarket parts without letting me know. He cause $26,000 damage and does not want to take responsibility for his poorly done oil change!<//Text>< pictures>

After letting me know the car i was looking at had a major oil lead, which i was glad to be warned about, he showed me an 85 BMW with faded paint, cracked seats, and told me that it was mechanically perfect and said he would sell it to me for exactly how much i told him I had.  he then continued to "work on it" for the next two weeks when he told me it would take two days. When I said that the odometer wasn't working he showed me a piece of paper that showed when he first got the car, the miles were slightly lower.  After driving the car home, 40 miles, and the odometer never moved, it was clear this was not the fact.  there were also a number of other mechanical problems that needed to be fixed and when i took it to another mechanic they said the work would cost $2,500 and that the car was only worth about $1,000 if that and Joey got $3,500 out of me! of course he made me write a statement saying i purchased the car as is to protect himself from law suits.

I love the Tuesday service which is in the early morning (5 to 7 am), it's very calm and not crowded at all.< /Review>

I feel like these reviews arent relieble because most people here are Egyptian and are biased, so here are my two cents. The campus itself is very nice and the abunas are very cool, but my problem with this church is that its community can be very toxic at times. This may or may not be for culture reasons, but i've seen everything ranging from bullying to out right racism towards people who arent Egyptian. If you are going to go there, attend the litergies and prayers but avoid the bad people.</Text>

Ordered from taco truck, just a few people waiting.: Beautiful 'super tacos' ! Very scrumptious with a little spicy kick. Delivered in a timely manner.  Will absolutely visit again!

Thanks guys!<//text>

The al pastor burrito (regular) was very good and not too greasy as some al pastor can be. The portion was generous enough to satisfy two meals!</Text>

Great authentic tacos. I had the tongue and cheek tacos. Very good. Would recommend sticking with the regular tacos, supreme tacos have too much fillings.</text>

Quick lunch place with avg-good Mexican offerings.  This seems to be the go-to place for Tivo employees.  Good Mexican beer selection that will help wash down a dozen or so of the street tacos.  🌮🍺< /text>

<text>It was an excellent meal but the service was not quite what I hoped. The young lady who was taking care of me was more focused on some friends than taking care of me. The other staff did their best to cover and the food made up for the neglect. A place I would highly suggest for a traditional meal. Parking was excellent unfortunately they don't serve ground beef ☹️< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

The tacos have gotten smaller and less tastee and the prices have gone up, there's also an additional charge if you use a credit card..... My friends and I would go there often, but not anymore, there are a lot of other taco places that offer better for for the same price.</Text>

They have a descent number of tables and a descent size parking lot. The food is very good. My kids like the car a asada tacos. I generally get a burrito which is very good. They have a hot red salsa which is more like a medium and a mild green one. My only complaint is that they charge for using a credit card.<//Text>

Don't mistake this place for "hole in the wall"... The food was freshly prepared to order, it was tasty and flavorful, and the wait staff was friendly and accommodating.< /Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Very good food and service. Great options for vegetarians. My favorite part was the salsa, very good testing salsa. They also have a red and green sauce which both exceeded expectations by a long shot. Portions sizes are large as well< /Text>< user_name>

For delicious street tacos and massive burritos, you can't go wrong with this cash preferred place. Worth the 30 minute walk from the nearby hotels.< /text>

So far I've tried the Carne Asada and Al Pastor in Super Burrito form. The burritos are a good portion size and have everything you'd expect from a solid Mexican restaurant. What makes it stand out is how flavorful the meat is; I'd prefer that it were not so finely minced however. I would recommend the Al Pastor as the char on the pork adds nice texture.

Take cash as I believe they charge a small credit card processing fee. Don't let that stop you from some really great food!< /Text><Rating>4<//Rating><user_id>101819613949134320335<//user_id>< Pics>

< review>
My wife and I eat at the food truck in the parking lot.

Really good Mexican food.  The pork is shredded but has a solid flavour.  Would like to highlight that the meat is not watery tasting like other places.  The beef is super cooked but still palatable.  We have tried taccs, super tacos, burritos, and tortas.

The food can be spicy or extra spicy - depending on what you would like.

They also have a restaurant next door that I have eaten at a number of times - similar taste.

It can be busy at times - normally lunch on week days is busy for the restaurant and the truck seems to be quite busy on Saturdays/Sundays around lunch.< /review>

Absolute best tacos anywhere. Taco truck outside is great if you just want a few tacos or a burrito to go. Sit inside for some chips with a mild/medium salsa if you have some time.

Lengua and carnitas are my go to proteins on my tacos with cheese added on top. Super tacos are too jam packed with sour cream, stick to the regular tacos and tell them to add cheese.< /Text>

Food is alright. They have a pretty spicy red sauce which is pretty good. Service is ehh.. They are always cleaning with a mop or wiping down tables then jumping to delivering food to the table and grabbing refills all without washing their hands.. Kinda gross. Id probably rate the food truck they have off of Lawrence a lot better review but as for the restaurant I'd prefer any other Mexican restaurant.</Text>

I'm not going to try it. LOL.

They need to have some real hot sauce.
Hotter than they serve. Not really a complaint.

food is delicious (still wondering about the sweet tea a coworker got). also, a little odd tha they cannot/won't split bills, and also a 4% upcharge for CC/DC use is a bit steep.</Review>

The staff were really nice and respectful but and me and husband loved the atmosphere. But unfortunately the quesadilla I was served was really greasy. The carne asada my husband had along with the rice and beans was very very dry. His meal look as though it was cooked a few hours ago and then heated up inside of a microwave. The best thing about the entire meal was the micheladas.</Review>

<text>Been coming here off and on for about six years and it seems the quality of the tacos are on a steady decline and the prices are on the rise. The quality of the food used to be amazing;  now its just "meh". Might try the truck next time in hopes the food is better there... else it's time to find a new favorite taco spot.</text>< gmapID>

This was my first time going here so I will have to see if the quality stays consistent enough for 5 Stars. I got a wet burrito and it was great! I went here at the busiest time during lunch and sat right down. I would recommend this place is you like Mexican food.</review>

<Text>This is a collection of two places. One sit down place and a truck parked next door. Both make the most amazing tacos. The city itself doesn't quite feel like bay area, but more like a city straight from Central CA. Dining here is more than about the food, it's about losing yourself in a place that's not quite Silicon Valley, inspite being so close.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Everything was fresh and well executed. The hand made corn tortillas were awesome. Only complaint is that for non-meat eaters there are very few options. No fish options, no real vegetarian options. I opted for a shrimp dish, which turned out great.</review>

I am giving this restaurant a 1 start because of the price not because of the quality of food. The food is really good the employees are really nice, but the price of the food is ridiculous and in top of that if you use you credit or debit card to pay for the food they charge you an additional fee to use your card. The food is good but the prices are ridiculous.  And if they give you chips make sure to ask if they are charging you for the chips. Mexican restaurants own by Mexican people are really expensive be careful where you go.</text>

Okay I was actually really surprised they made me my custom order basically no issues at all yeah I was around like 10 or $11 but no big deal was kind of being a little more than I want to pay for breakfast but that's okay it's Oakland but the thing is that the breakfast really wasn't up to par to my standards but the taste of it was absolutely incredible yes the look wasn't great but the taste of the food was just to die for.  Another thing is if you haven't checked out their Salsas so far you definitely should check out their mild salsa their mild sauce is problem in the best mild salsa I have ever had and I'm not a big fan of mild salsa or the green stuff but this stuff is just absolutely incredible check them out there's a Target going to be built right next door so going stop on by.< /text>

<text>My friend and I both had burritos. His was a carnitas and mine was a chili verde. We both thought our burritos were nicely spiced and had a nice serving of meat. The menu was varied enough to appeal to a broad cross-section of people. The restaurant was clean and well taken care of. The decorations we're humble in style of a traditional Taqueria.< /text>< user_name>

I’m never coming back again to this place. I had a bad experience in the past but i wanted to give it another try hopping that this time I had a better experience. Again, the waitres did not even say good morning and her face look like if we weren’t welcome because we are Hispanic or I don’t know what problems this lady has. After she delivered the drinks, I was expecting her to ask us if we were ready to order but instead, she told us that they have rules and nobody can bring food from any other place. (I understand that) but it was a little bag of McDonald’s fries from my 4 year old little niece. Because she was hungry when she got out of school and I pass by McDonalds and got her that little bag of fries. Anyways we got up and leave the restaurant and the lady did not do anything to make us stay. They lost customers today and I don’t know how many you’ll continue to loose. (Owner,, train your people and avoid yourself legal issues in the future.) food is great!< /Text>

Good basic Mexican food. No checks, remember your table # when you leave so you get the right check. The super buritto may be enough for 2, it's rather large.</text>

Prices are great, lunch crowd makes is very busy hot spot, the wait staff serves you most expeditiously, leaving you time to enjoy a cold cerveza or two, I mean they are really on top,of serving you! I'm not a millennial, so I tip on performance, 25% here, they deserve it.</Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>No no no antes de ordenar me disen que van aserrar .... Y Vengo con mi familia . pero si tienen un loco borracho cantando en so villar con todo so tiempo del gusto . y no que ivan a serrar . me parese que la michacha joven que trabaja en la noche, ya tenia prisa .... Mendiga ambre .... Seria los cosineros o que seria ...

No no no before we ordered they tell me they are closing instead of welcoming us and I  came with my family. But there was a drunk guy playing 8 ball with all the time im thw world. I thought they were closing?! It seemed to me that the lady at night was in a hurry to close to get home instead of giving good customer service. Apart of that we took the order to go. As soon as we got home to eat we were missing 3 orders. We went back not so long after we left and no one was there. They were all gone.  We spent roughly around $100 for us to not have good service and fiod missing. Worst place to eat. I dont recommend this place at all!!!!!< /text>< pics>

Authentic but bland Mexican food. I got a chicken quesadilla and it was not very tasty, the chicken was dry, and the condiments we're spread all over the quesadilla (instead of in little cups). Not the worst quesadilla I've ever had, but honestly I've had better.< /Text>

Tacos, tacos, and tacos. That's all you need to know about taco de oro. They also have food trucks. One is located right next to it and one is at the homedepot by the great mall. TACOS.<//text>

Good place to have a quick lunch. Mexican food is spicy in general, but these guys have non spicy options.</review>

Best carne asada ever. So superbly crispy, and the quesadilla was perfectly cheesy. Good horchata but not enough cinnamon for me. Overall, I'd travel from Hayward just for the food here.</text>

Open only from 11:30AM to ~2:15PM M-F.  Their trucks outside, and at ~Elco&Lawrence, do not make the very good Wet Burrito Carne Asada, and it is just "Not" the same as inside.  However, inside, The Wet Burrito, is worth walking there barefoot in Summer, to just taste it!  .  .
OMG!  So tasty good, with its Secret  bouquet of Chili Flavor and Zing!  Be sure to ask for Green Salsa too, and that Wet Burrito will do what it says ;-)
I pitty the poor people that do not tip 20% here.  That means bring $12 each with water only.  You will be so satisfied.  Take a second to go for a friend!  They will be so grateful!
Super gorgeous servers, and Cooks who can cook too!
I've never had a Margarita for Lunch in my life before, but I hear they are available.  Exotic bottled beers too.</text>

(Translated by Google) A taco and burrito restaurant. Enjoy authentic Mexican at a reasonable price. It's a pity that the cola you drank tasted a bit disinfecting, but the dishes are usually delicious.

タコスとブリトーが美味しいお店。リーズナブルな価格で本格的なメキシカンが楽しめる。飲んだコーラが少々消毒味がしたのが残念だが、料理は普通においしい。< /text>

Servicio malo!!! Me dijieron que iban a cerrar y tuve que llevar mi orden para la casa. Mi orden no estába correcta y 3 personas no agarraron su comida. No es lo que cuesta es la inconveniencia que causa. Por favor chequen su orden antes de llevar a su casa!!!<//text>< pictures>
