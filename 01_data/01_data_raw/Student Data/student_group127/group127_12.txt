If your not going to cook..  The kitchen is not clean by code. The screws are not holding the oven door. Wall plugs that doesn't work right need to be disconnected,  with a wall cover. To eliminate the bad wire/plug that could cause fire. The bedroom wall plug is not working. But they left a fan and lamp plugged in. For what? for show??? Plus fake flower that create dust bacteria and germs. Needs to be left out.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>What a pleasant experience we had at this resort, after a long day at the slopes, all we hoped for was a warm place to lay our heads down since we decided to stay the night in big bear, this spot beyond exceeded our expectations,  the place was nice and neat,  everything so clean and tighty,  the atmosphere of these cabin like houses are very cozy and accommodated the climate just right, we recommend this place and we will definitely be returning for our future stays, did I mention that their bigger cottages have their private  small jacuzzi, it accommodates 2-3 people comfortably.  They are covid safe and all precautions are taken in respects to their costumers , we felt safe and that gave us piece of mind. Wish I had more pics to share folks,  but I was too tired to be snapping away, next time I'll provide more.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Omg they are great I would definitely recommend to anyone that wants to stay in big bear. Before even getting to the place your can check in via text and I like that they offer that when we got there we already knew our cabin # and how to get in the lady explained everything and had a lot of room I loved it and so my kids and husband 💕 we are even planning to return in a a few months. Thank you for the hospitality Bear Creek Resort!!!<//Text><rating>5< /rating>< name>

<Review>Better than we expected! Impressed! Great location next to food, liquor and park to sled (Must buy day parking pass $5 at liquor store and other stores, places) as well as Alpine Slide Park. Staying in 2 story cabin, two queens and sofa bed. Comes with kitchen, fridge, pots and pans fireplace, everything you need. NO bed bugs, prior review scared me and I checked throughly. No bugs, no sign of bugs faces, stains and no bites. Store stocked with surprisingly reasonable prices on items. Extremely nice and helpful staff. Also close to Boulder Bay. I'd like to suggest a hand rail on the left side of staircase to go up the stairs for support. Other than that extremely pleased.<//Review>< name>

The place looks nice and cozy in the outside. The cabin where we stayed was poorly maintained. The couch in the living room was broken and cover with bed sheets to hide the neglected furniture. The cabin was clean but not inviting. The check out was at 10am and at 9:30am we had the cleaning person spying through our window checking if we were still inside. Very unprofessional and uncomfortable. The location of the hotel is really good and close to the ski resort.<//text>

< Review>
The cabin was terrible with respect to the price of the stay.No ventilation in the bathroom.Poor condition. I found the hanger in the bedroom is broken.WiFi connection is very bad in the cabin and so much interruption. When working it is slow.I can clearly hear the people staying at the neighboring cabin next as if they are staying with us in the same cabin. This is completely unacceptable.I booked through hotels.com and check in time is stated from 4:00pm to 9:00pm. I got a text message at 5:30 stating that the office is closing at 6:00pm and not enough time to stop by. Had to text a copy of my ID and CC to check in before 6:00<//Review>

This place called us and told us they'll  need to cancel our reservations. We had booked this stay over 2 month ago for the 4th of July weekend. They did offer a small cabin but for the same price. The room was nice.</review>

We stood in Cabin 27. Cabin needs updating especially the shower. You can see missing grout that was filled in and now looks black. It looks so gross we did not use the shower. Needs detailed cleaning like blinds and top of the  white refrigerator was very dirty it was black. The towels look old and very used up. One of the towels had someone’s hair.<//review>

Resort is conveniently located. Was responsible price. Had a cute kitchen and sitting area. Check in was super easy with everything texted. It worked out great. There are a few things to be aware of. Our cabin backed up to the main road. Which made sleeping difficult with the constant lights and loud noises. The mattresses had a memory foam topper but I found the beds to be uncomfortable. The ac unit was great and loud to help block a lot of noise but it sucks up everything from outside and when we arrived it smelled like someone had just smoked a cigar in our unit. There is no bathtub, so with a toddler and baby that was hard. We ended up staying one night. If your looking for a quick place to crash to ski. Awesome. But if you have kids don't stay in cabin 20. Too much noise.</Review>

Wonderful. Liked my room, little close to rd but was quiet after dark. Great mountain green apple tree outside. Had a fireplace but decided not to indulge due to  many fires ongoing. Air cleared second day and weather was wonderful. Little Aztec restruant across street was the bomb! Will definitely come stay again!</text>

Loved the room, it was very cute! One drawback was that I could hear some of our neighbors, not sure if they were being extra noisy or if the walls are just a little thin, but they quieted down before it got late. I have stayed in the cabins here before and will use one of them next time I am up here!< /text>

< Review>
The first impression of the location was very disappointing. In the living room, the furniture seemed to be crowded among each other and tacky. The couches didn't seem clean and we're just draped with a couch cover. Moreover, since the furniture was all shoved into the same room, the front door didn't open all the way. This seemed to be the common theme throughout the unit. The dining room table was disgusting, still filthy with what looked like died chocolate and frosting. There were also various stains among the floor. In the kitchen, although it seemed clean, some of the pots were still dirty along with the microwave plate and inside the mini fridge freezer. These are required to be cleaned on checkout... This left us questioning the cleanliness of the rest of the unit. Even the bottom shower was dirty with hair in the drain. Lastly, the unit looked nothing like the pictures displayed on the Orbit website which seemed to display pictures from other units that had better furnishings. We did try to change to another unit but we were told we had to go through Expedia; we booked through Orbitz. We promptly called the care line and had Robin, Orbitz customer service, contact the front desk. Robin was told that there were no other units available except for a smaller studio. We looked outside to a partially empty parking lot that didn't send to add up. We ended staying the night since it seemed like we weren't going to win or get our money back. I don't recommend this location.<//Review>

<text>I liked the log cabin aesthetic of Bear Creek Resort. The bathroom was clean and the beds were comfortable.We were very tired after a long journey, and paid a premium to stay in this comfortable cabin. But, there was a black out in the cabin at night, and my friends and I were terrified. There was no way to contact the staff about the problem at night. I sent them multiple messages and call, but nothing worked.We had a sleepless and uncomfortable night. They finally sent someone at 9AM the next day to look at the issue, when we were already packing to leave. They were totally uncooperative, when I asked for a refund, and said that the issue was fixed before we left (Just 30 minutes before we left). It was horrible. I later checked their reviews on other sites, and saw multiple complaints of rude customer service.< /text>< Date>

The most discussing place I have ever been. Unique combination of dust, dirt, animal and human hair and the smell of smoke. Declaring this place as a homeless shelter  would be a human rights violation.<//Text>

Horrible place! The home was extremely dirty.. We rented a big 3 bedroom house didn’t have enough toilet paper and towels we had to buy our own toilet paper the manger/owner was cussing at us once we addressed the issue very unprofessional.. There was exposed metal on the walls the head damage the railing on the stairs was broken and had screws sticking out I had children with me and they could of been extremely injured I do not recommend this place at all for the amount of money we paid<//Text>

Check-in starts at 3 pm but I got in early. However, the owner/manager(?) left a message saying they hide my key so I could get in and settled if they're not around. So that was convenient. Room is exactly as advertised. But if it were me I'd get rid of the carpet. Laminate would probably work better cleaning wise. I just stayed in a room instead of a cabin because it was just for 1 night. The cabins look cute and cozy. The property looks well maintained. There's a pool and outdoor entertainment area as well.< /Review>

My honey surprised me and brought me here for my birthday.

It's easy to see from the road and they maintain the grounds very well. All of the cabins have icicle lights that are a nice touch. There is also plenty of parking and the parkingnlot is spacious.

The cabin that we stayed in was quite small but cozy.

The pros
The heater worked great and keeps every part of the cabin warm.

There is a mini kitchen with a nice size stove and sink

The bed was comfortable

Rooms are clean for the most part

Water pressure in the shower was good

The person at the desk was friendly

The cons
You can hear everything your neighbors are saying and seeing on tv. We had noisy neighbors who had on loud music and heard their conversations.

The TV in the room is really small

The sofa was not comfortable.  It was pretty hard.

The shower is tiny and the shower head is short.

There is a small and old microwave in the kitchenette

Probably won't be staying here again at the price we paid.<//Text>

We found this place out of sheer luck last year and are so happy we did! thank god we didn't  take the yelp reviews on this resort . on our first trip to Big Bear we stayed in cabin #15  and fell in love with the place. We just had our second trip to Bear Creek Resort  and Angela, Karen  took great care of us! This time cabin #12  was home! Wow, it was so cozy- the wood burning fire place , Big living  room , Big kitchen , 2 King size beds really made it for us. I tell everyone to give Bear creek resort 5 star ! Great Location and lots of parking space .</review>

Arrived with mask on. Seated in a socially distanced booth. Our server was friendly, courteous and attentive. The food was served hot and fresh. The quality was excellent. The omletes we had were very generous and prepared with great detail. I enjoyed every bite. (Although I came up a little short, couldn't eat the entire meal) my only complaint would be the hash browns were a little light on the brown, could've been cooked a little longer, but there weren't bad.</review>

Theres a heater and fireplace and they provided us with towels dish soap and sponge. Along with utensils and mugs. The place was clean and our cabin (15) had a jacuzzi and it felt very cozy. I would go again and definitely recommend. Maybe get a cabin a bit farther from the road. But other than that wonderful place. The lights on the cabins are so pretty at night and so are the stars!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c4b3b989946b2b:0xc70b3c00eba9678b< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Our recent stay was heartbreaking for us we got there and hours after one our family members past so we left in a hurry. They owners proceeded to message us in a very vulgar way curse words and everything how disrespectful it was for us to leave in an inappropriate way. No one deserves Customer service like this. If I can give them 0 stars I would.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Nice clean cabins unfortunately we arrived during the second wave of the Covid epidemic and the pool & jacuzzi was drained. The owner was very sweet & let my family use a private jacuzzi and swim on her private dock!
Will definitely get back to taste the new food idea!!  Coming soon!!!</text><gmap_id>0x80c4b3b989946b2b:0xc70b3c00eba9678b</gmap_id>< pics>

Where to begin? Kitchen window no lock. Bedroom blinds broken with no curtain. Bathroom blinds missing lower half. Shower curtain shreaded and hooks missing allowing water out on floor. Couch broken, needed to be cleaned against wall so as to not flatten into a bed. Wiring to TV hanging in corner and wrapped around fireplace tools and more..........
Worth 200 a night? Maybe 50?
Owner doesn't seem to care. Wish I could post the picture<//review>

Thural rewiew.Stayed in featured cabin on there website big kitchen, private backyard w/own hottub etc.
Check in easy & I want to say staff definitely seemed nice accommodating to things. Upon parking noticed door to cabin was open shut it & as always did a welcome recording. It is smaller then expected & I for some off reason though 2 bedrooms but was 1 w/2 beds no big deal.Ktchen is huge feature but fridge ice & water line is not connected so got ice from office.Backyard good size & has bbq(bring own grill stuff)outside seating w/hot tub,this was chosen 3 reasons & 1 w/hottub! Unfortunately we asap had issues Hottub top was broken from group who just left & VERY dark dirty H20 & phone wouldn't work etc, call desk my cell phone & maintenance came out a few Xs that evening so we had unexpected few interferences w/what was supposed to be romantic evening. He 1st needed to fix hottub w/out shock so we could use it & put clarifier &step3 chlorine w/a floater said that way in a hour we can use it, no issue!He then said phone issue was everyone N if he plugged it in it would ring constantly N be better off unplugged, okay!..next front door not opening from weather being hot to cold was doing it to all them & showed how to open it. Okay so dinners done & times wasted but least management was top of things. We went to public pool & hottub because ours had to wait a hour & hottub public one was horrible dirty also on top cold! We said forget it went to village, 2 hrs later getting in our hottub private areas burned we asap jumped out I was laughing but was not in funny way, we shower & said forget that also. Tv time! In the am hottub was finally usable the clarifier did what it does not like a dirty swamp I don't even want to post the pic lol it was fixed suitable so.There are good & bad staying I guess.Price plays a role. I would not pay much because there is no lake water view or wooded solid privacy in back, it is fence & 2 story house watching.Is a outdoor firepit steps away from cabins & wedding/ event area nice. Pool was ok, not the public hot tub thou. Cabin satellite & alot channels we used 1st night plans ruined. A wall furnace or personal heater or fireplace. a window ac unit n kitchen/fan hallway. Bathroom is small & no bathtub, rock shower withOUT soap holder & worked around it. Livingroom futon & 2 chairs. Bedroom 2 queen bds comfy & elect/fireplace, traffic am cars a wake up/turning on fan or etc eliminated n 2nd night slept. We did ask for a extend 3rd night in cabin or of another on the grounds easy if there was availability because next day my bday n 1st night was ruined. got reply it was not booked so planning another night & confirm price.In am I call before walking to office & I'm told higher then was told(not kewl) I mean 1st night of several interesting surprises (ruined it to just say it) but we kept smiling &made best of it. Anyway they definitely made a bad business decision as after being told the higher price unexpectedly 9am next day I asap said ok, we are out! And we did just that. They lost money I mean something better then 0! Nthing personal against nobody all are nice & about business. Good spot near the village if like pool/hottub (if its hot, working & clean) would ask. I think a couple fits this cabin perfectly! Even 2. smaller but suitable & cute! Warning backyard big 2 story house w/windows might bother hottub people. Sun hits porch in am. front not private you see/hear everything. No continental breakfast. Toilet paper out no extra roll.I might stay here again if(hottubs private & public)clean/temp correct n fix little things.pool was fine. In 16yrs 50 cabins across usa we never had a cabin ever have issues until now even here included. Not bad or good review. Neutral.</text>

The bed was amazingly comfortable and cozy! It was so nice I even overslept for my ski day the next day. But the ample rest made me feel extra refreshed. I’ve stayed in several different rooms here and I’ve always had a positive experience. Angela and everyone who manages the place are some of the most genuinely friendly people. You can definitely tell they put a lot of love and genuine care and love for this resort. Staying here with the welcoming vibe definitely had a significantly positive impression on me and my party. I definitely value positive interaction between staff and myself when I stay at places so I’ll definitely continue to stay here 😊<//review>

Stayed here for one night. The check in and check out were very easy and convenient without a personal contact with staff. The facility is well planned with a little kitchen, a living room and a bedroom with two good size beds.  Make sure you check the small playground, there is a very rare slide signed  “Made in America” !!! This is so rare these days. Extra star for that.< /text>

<Review>We stayed in unit 12 a 2 bedroom there were six in our party we had plenty of sleeping conditions. The unit was clean and had everything there were required to enjoy ourselves. The resort is close to eateries and a market. We'll return. It was worth our money.</Review>< user_id>

<Name>Lily Montes</Name><review>I had a reservation canceled it with in hours. I had an option to cancel for 233.00 or get fees waived. Booking.com said it would take about 48 hours for the property to respond. I get an email saying my reservation was still on. I called the property  (didn't get the lady's name) I explained to her what happen. At the beginning she was nice then she got very rude, saying that they just got a message from booking.com about my request. I told her what would I need to do. She said that they charged me the 1st night because I just called them today (same day of reservation) I tried to explain to her that booking.com did not say to call it said waiting for there respond. Of course I got upset and told her she was not listening, she said the same thing about me AND HUNG UP!!!!. I CALLED BACK AT LEAST 5 TIMES DIRECTLY TO VOICE MAIL, AFTER THE 5TH CALLED SHE SAID IM BUSY PLEASE HOLD, AND NEVER ANSWERED ME. Then she texting me sorry I can't talk right now.<//review><Rate>1<//Rate><UserId.>112508787676210867814<//UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80c4b3b989946b2b:0xc70b3c00eba9678b<//Gmap_id></record>

5🌟 for sure. My husband, my 2 little boys and I feel in love with this place such a cozy and romantic. My 6 year old now calls it our other home. 😊👌🏼 The perfect location, only a few minutes from everything.  We highly recommend. Can't wait to go back.< /text>

<Text>Positive: The staff are all very nice. The outside appearance is very attractive. Negative: The bathroom smelled of mold and was overwhelming. The bed had a memory foam on top of the mattress which was hot and uncomfortable. The windows did not work so no air circulation.<//Text>< Pics>

The aesthetics were fine. Cute outside, mural artwork in the interior. We were in cabin 14. We rented for 9 people and 2 dogs. There was enough beds for 10, however there was only 1 toilet, only one mirror which was in the dimly lit bathroom.  Could only find electrical plugs in the kitchen.  The fireplace flew wouldn't open.  The blinds we all torn up upstairs, and we couldn't close the bedroom blinds overlooking the parking lot. The 2 beds I laid on were terrible, and there was only seating for 5 in the living room save a few folding chairs.  All this for $600 a night.< /Review>

We just left cabin 24 and it was amazing. We stayed for 2 days and man we didn't want to leave. Mandi made everything so special. She's definitely the reason that we will be back. She helped me surprise my husband for his birthday, she set everything up while we were fishing and it was beautiful. She deserves a raise! Thank you girl. Can't wait to come back< /Review>

Negative: The staff lived there and you could smell their Chinese food etc being made.  We walked in, in the morning and there was a lady in the hallway in her pajamas brushing her teeth.  It was super super awkward and uncomfortable.  We wonâ€™t stay here aga</Text>

<Text>Skyler and her Manager saved my family from freezing in our car. If your looking for a place to stay in Big bear, then this is the best place to come. My family and I went to Big Bear for a day of sledding on Sunday. There was a snow storm that caused our truck to get stuck even with cable chains on. We had to abandon the car and were able to book a room while waiting for help. A nice lady stopped to help and provide transportation and help along with Skyler & the Mgr to take us to Bear Creek Resort. They provided food, water and extra blankets for the night. They showed such grace and saved us in a crisis. These cabins are great and the staff are amazing. Thank you all for your generosity.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The volume on the TV didn't work and the blinds didnt even work properly as well. I gave them a 1/5 because I wasnt satisfied and they send me a hate text message saying that I hope that something bad happens to me and was rude of me to give them a low rating. Really bad customer service and definitely wouldnt recommend anyone to stay here especially with the really bad smell in the room, the phone ringer going off and the maintenance guy randomly tries to come in the room with keypad knowing that people are staying there. He would have opened the door if i didnt put the deadlock. I had a horrible experience.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c4b3b989946b2b:0xc70b3c00eba9678b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This resort is great. The staff make sure that you are taken care of. Cabins are cozy and quaint.  There are so many different cabins, that you can come once a month and not stay in the same one for a year.... I'm guessing...I have not counted...< /review>

The rooms were not really cleaned I requested clean blankets and comforters and they weren't  clean 1 bed still smelled of perfume or cologne and there was hair in the sheets. Also no snow removal to your room was super icy like 5 to 7 inches of ice on the stairs going to the room the big huge parking lot icy  they have a snow plow on the premises but not used around by the office parking lot was so so it was super icy to check in or out we fell watched several other people fall trying to check in or out  Owner didn't care. We called the day before are arrival to make sure the jacuzzi was working we were straight up lied  to we had got a call from another place of a cancellation due to there jacuzzi not working. so we called here to double check. Cause the other place jacuzzi was broken and they would give us very good discount so we decided to stay here because of the jacuzzi big mistake and to remind them of the request of all clean blankets bed spreads  was told yes jacuzzi was working we were straight up lied to about the jacuzzi !!!!! and the blankets and bed spreads not replaced with clean ones at over 600 a night  we're expecting Jacuzzi and clean bedding and several quest were complaing about it several days before we arrived that we spoke to that the Jacuzzi Was Not working when they arrived so we're straight up lied to!!!! the TV didn't work had lines through it to where you couldn't even see the picture ahead other people if they were having same problem and they weren't so we called said it would be fixed never was this owner only cares about the all mighty dollar not its guests.. we asked for a discount on the price I see what I can do we were never given a discount we actually went and bought are own sheets blankets and pillows so we had somewhere clean to sleep the kitchen and fireplace were the only thing nice when you pay good money for the services they offer and then do not have them and won't even give a discount for it bad business practice you want a hot jacuzzi after skiing for several days.. or just because it was ADVERTISED will never stay here again or recommend this place the town was lovely great food great skiing this was are only disappointment chosing this place for our family vacation<//review>

There is also no ventilation in the bathroom, so you can see in the ceiling brown stains from the moisture. Also, it rained when we arrived and there was a leak coming in through the window. We called the first office, but no maintainence was done. They just gave use a bunch of towels to put under the window. Lastly the window blinds were filthy. They need to be replaced.< /Text><response>None< /response>< rate>

The cabins are so cute and wonderful. The staff was so friendly. I loved the kitchen and rooms. All the walls have murals of forest and bears. Really nice cabin feel. You can light a fire and keep the whole cabin warm! I would totally come again!!< /Review>

Day of check-in and things are looking good. (it is the off season) but the units look well kept, the owners/staff are excellent. We had a strange need to move our reservation up a day and they accommodated us smoothly.
Currently seems to be a great set of cabins to rent.</review>

<Review>We booked chale with one bedroom with Mountain View, but it was view to the road and super noisy! We expected that chale will be separate building, but it was just a room with separate entrance. When we try to upgrade, staff even didn’t react, just printed our confirmation and showed that we booked this room and that’s it. Don’t recommend, everything is super old and smell not so good.</Review>< gmap_id>

I went with my husband and kids and we loved it, I was referred by a coworker who always stays there and we will be now too. The cabin was very spacious kitchen had all the dishes and pots I needed to make hot chocolate and cookies. We had 2 nice bedrooms comfy beds and heaters and plenty of extra blankets as well as a sofa bed in the living room. We had a real fireplace and the location is great close to the village and Heather at the front desk was very nice and friendly will definitely be back.<//Review>

It's a good value and my experience was what I expected it to be from an older facility like most of the cabins in Big Bear. Included with that is old furniture, old kitchenware and old typical old cabin accoutrements like sticky doors, windows that could use a little lubrication and typical creaks and cracks that most people might find is par for the course.

The location is good with a liquor store with groceries across the street and some restaurants in quick walking distance but parking can be challenging on a busy week.

They do supply low bandwidth wifi access and satellite tv but air conditioning is not available. It does get a little stuffy on hot days. Central room heater works.

My only real criticism is management doesn't limit pool activities so beware of loud activities near the facility pool late at night for cabins adjacent the pool.<//text>

After making reservation online 2 weeks prior with AARP I was called by manager or owner and told they couldn't honor the rate I was given. She told me it would cost another $50. She thanked me numerous times for being so cooperative. Then we arrived instead of staying in cabin room for the 3 people they had they stuck us in crappy hotel room above the office. Traffic noise was insane till 1am and then when sun rise at 5am our room was as bright as can be. It is cute room but not big enough for the 3 of us,  noisy as heck with main road 10 foot from room, and no black out curtains. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and will not be returning. Shame because the cabins looked nice, from the outside. If you do book here confirm you are not stick in the horrible hotel rooms. There are only 4 or 5 but they will ruin your trip. Trust me.</text>

As a recent newlywed, my husband and I decided to go to Big Bear for a quick little honeymoon getaway. We decided on Bear Creek Resort because we got this good deal on Groupon. We got a deal for a studio cabin and it was perfect! I thought we were going to get a tiny little room but no, it was a very cozy and spacious little cabin. It had a kitchen, nice bathroom, a fireplace and a TV with a good channel selection. My husband and I enjoyed the location as well. Bear Creek was in a good location with restaurants right across the street and not to far off from the tourist areas. Even though we were there for only 2 nights we wished we could have stayed a bit longer! Upon checkout we were also given a $50 off credit on our next stay (that does not expire!) which we will definitely be using on our next trip to Big Bear! I highly recommend this place!< /Text>

<review>I had reserved cabin number 8 several months in advance for a romantic holiday-weekend getaway. This cabin was advertised to have a private whirlpool, fenced yard, full kitchen, fireplace, and no shared walls. We bought our firewood in advance, took time off work, and made the trip a day early to stay in a hotel at the bottom of the mountain the night before. We wanted to get an earlier start the next morning, as heavy traffic was expected. Once we arrived at Bear Creek, we were impressed with the size and cleanliness of the facility. The little office store even had free material to use as firestarters. We checked in, received our cabin key, and made our way to cabin 6. Wait, 6? We paid extra for cabin 8. Heading back to the office, they advised us they had given someone else cabin 8 and reassigned us to 6. This was a smaller cabin, no fireplace, no private yard, no whirlpool. The office was then so nice to let us know that "Oh, the whirlpool hasn't even worked in over a year. We don't charge extra for that anyway". Well, that would have been nice to know before I put extra money down on that cabin. If this wasn't an extra charge, then why was I able to spot check several different dates and find that cabin regularly priced $30-40 more than other similar cabins? The office said that wasn't true, but didn't have an explanation as to why there was a price difference when making a future reservation, and why they were still advertising the unit had a whirpool on the website. They refused to perform a partial refund for a lesser cabin, and instead suggested we find somewhere else to stay. Not once did they apologize for giving someone else our cabin, and instead said "It is what it is". Big Bear was 99.9% booked this weekend. The only remaining room was at the motel 6 for $450. motel 6. $450. For a motel 6... So, we received a full refund for the room, and began our long trek home because we had nowhere to sleep in 30° weather. Guess we'll just have to eat the cost of the hotel the night before, the firewood, and the gas and time it took to drive out there. Thanks, Bear Creek. Thank you for being incompetent, wasting my money, and ruining our weekend.< /review>< Pics>

Booked a room here that was advertised as 95$ a night.   After booking I get a grand total of 145$.   Baffled,   I go read the fine print and see that in addition to regular tax they tack on a 35$ cleaning fee BEFORE YOU EVEN ARRIVE.   I’m sorry but that’s insulting to be pre emptively treated like I’ll leave a mess and it is unscrupulous to advertise the room rate separately from the cleaning.  It should be one rate like just about every single other hotel.   I cancelled my reservation and booked elsewhere for cheaper,  where I was only charged tax and room rate.     It’s a shame because it seems like a nice place but if they bait and switch you on the booking I could only imagine what else is falsely advertised.<//Review>

👀Great place to stay at.......fantastic staff and the manager was awesome as well.  We have stayed at other places in Big Bear but nothing like this........even our friends that were with us this last weekend loved their cabin and they were very happy as well.

We at Golden Image would recommend this place for anyone that is interested in staying in Big Bear and you will see why it's a great place to hang your hat and stay awhile.

Please keep in mind that this establishment is under new Managerment so things are changing for the best and you will enjoy your stay😎<//Review>

Overall great place and would definitely go back. A couple downfalls .. was advertised with a fireplace, the only fireplace I saw was in the main lobby (maybe just our cabin didnt have one) and was also advertised with a day spa which it apparently hasnt had in years. Other than that, room was great, staff was super nice and it was in a great location.</text>

We booked cabin 5 for 2 nights, and we ended up staying only one, without sleep and with bed-bug bites. we found about 10 bed-bugs, extremely disappointed. these insects are the worse. don't recommend this place to anyone. this place made me never want to take a trip to big bear, it's a sacrifice to go there and end up with these scenarios.<//Review>

Came here with my family last minute to big bear and ended up booking a cabin at BEAR CREEK RESORT and couldn't have asked for a better place, the hospitality of the Stephen and Heather was amazing I couldn't be any more thankful & greatful....I really appreciate it how Heather literally came to our cabin and help us out with trying to turn on our chimney wood fire but unfortunately the fire was being stubborn so we couldn't get it on..... but thank you Heather for not giving up and kept trying ....all in all I have nothing bad to say about the place nice people and just really liked the vibe from STEPHEN and HEATHER thank you for making me and family stay a very pleasant one and will be defenatlly gonna be coming back, keep up the good work guys see you soon ❤👍<//text>

<review>Absolutely perfect we came for our 5year anniversary with the kiddos. We stayed in cabin 10. It was perfect the 2 beds were so comfortable. They had a restroom upstairs and downstairs they had a full kitchen with pots pans etc. The full restroom was downstairs large dining table and tv, fireplace , and a futon In the living room with coffee table. It was perfect we for sure want to go back again. They also have a large size pool and Jacuzzi. PERFECT !!!</review>< pics>

<text>My husband and I have never been to Big Bear Lake and weren't sure where to stay. I was skeptical when I saw a great deal on Groupon but I'm so glad we decided to stay here for the weekend. The staff has been super friendly both on the phone and in person. The studio cabin is perfect for two and came with a wood burning fireplace, dining area for two and full kitchen. Unfortunately, it was too cold to use the free 2 hour kayaking voucher.</text></record>

We had a great stay at the Bear Creek Resort!  Our one bedroom cabin was clean and cozy.  We had an easy time checking in early... a big help to me since this was a business trip and I was in town early before my meeting.  The grounds are well kept and our cabin looked really nice from the outside.  My wife took the photo, so I will try to upload that later.

Once inside we found the rooms clean and neat.  It's not a giant cabin but it was just what we needed.  The linen's were nice and fresh as well.  The bathroom is small... but again, it was clean and met our needs.

It was a busy day in Big Bear and we thought it might be a loud night, but to our great joy things remained quite around the resort and we enjoyed a good nights rest.  I recommend the Bear Creek Resort... especially if you have a family.  The units come with kitchens so you can make your own meals.< /Review>

Motel room was a bit old. Parts of the bathroom were updated, but otherwise, in need of remodel. TV worked but was a bit small. Fridge in the room was good. Room door handle came off when pulled close with any force. Overall stay was ok. But given other options with similar price point in the area, don't know that I'd go back.< /Text>

Not a good experience. Management lacking Weather was hot and all we had was broken fans. Coffee maker broken, tv had mute on several channels. And most important the pool was shut down about 5pm on a hot day, because he decided to put chemicals in pool and and juguzzi.  When I tried to inform of problem, I was ignored.  We won't be coming back here again, unless management changes.< /Review>

Spent the night in a summer night. No AC, one fan for a place with two bedrooms and three king size beds so most of us were very uncomfortable. Their so called breakfast were old bagels with no cream cheese and instant oatmeal. Shower was weak and inconsistently hot n cold. Will never stay here again.< /Review>

<Review>I was very impressed with this place. I made the reservation last minute and didnt really know much about the place except that they allow dogs and they had an availability for the night. When we got there we fell in love with the place instantly. We got room #6 and it was so perfect...small kitchen with all the necessities, living area, dining table for two, front porch with shrubbery for privacy, BBQ right out front, cozy bedroom, and TV that could be watched from the living room or bedroom. It was so perfect we wished we were staying another night! The only complaint is that the bed was extremely sagged in the middle. But it was sufficient enough to get some shut eye.<//Review><userid>None</userid><rate>None< /rate><Pics>None< /Pics>< date>

The checked our room out to someone else and we had to wait 2 hours.  Then when they called back to tell me the room was ready the lady was extremely rude and disrespectful. Wost place i have dealt with.  Recommend never stay to stay with them not worth thr hastle.</Text>< Time>

This place was awesome. I'm an old man who spent a lot of time in my younger years up here so my daughter took me on a spontaneous visit. She just happened across it on her phone while up there and we popped in. There was no one in the office when we arrived but it was past 5 maybe even 6, they had a number to call and someone showed up shortly. I think her name was Heather and she was very sweet and accommodating. I understand that's usually how mountain places like this goes, some of the workers live onsite or close by so even if they aren't in the office, they are close by, so don't let that detur you.
Each "room" is actually its own little cabin home. We asked for a 2 bed so it had a living room (with real wood burning fire place, futon couch and tv), its own kitchen (stove, oven, microwave, full fridge, coffee pot, toaster and dishes) a bedroom (ours had 2 queen beds) and of course a bathroom. They also have bbqs outside, every other cabin. They accepted our dogs which was a huge plus. They have a pool but it was too cold to swim. They do require you to buy wood from them for the fireplace ($7 a bundle) no outside wood. It was so nice and relaxing we just kept staying for a few nights. Really a great place and am glad we found it, hope to go back soon. Again, the manager or lady in charge while we were there (Heather) was amazingly kind and accommodating, she was a huge part of making the stay so wonderful, thank you!!< /Review>

<Review>Worst experience ever in bear creek resort. The room was double booked and the owner had no idea what to do when this happens and according to what owner said it has happened multiple times since Expedia service cracked down but they have absolutely no idea how to deal with this kind of situation , or they just don't fk care.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< pics>

< Review>
Worse place ever. Girl at the front desk was so rude. I rented a room come to find out there's no ac. I have  a 6 year old and a 7 year old. And it was well over 90 out side. When i went back to the front desk and asked for are money back she said no refunds. I asked to speak to the manger and she sat there and text for 5 min in front of us then said manger said no refunds. I told her its to hot to have my kids in the room. And she had the nerve to tell me if ur hot go jump in the pool. And one of the guys in a cabin kept coming out and smoking some kind of drug. We told her n she said what do u want me to do. Worse place I've ever stayed at< /Review>

The cabin was nice but a bit overpriced. There was a hot tub but it wasn't completely private we could still see ou to the parking lot. I was expecting it to be a lot more secluded but this is not a hit on them as the whole area is overrun with tourist spots and lodging crammed around the lake. Overall I had a great time.<//text>

Aweful, this place truly sucks.  WiFi is terrible.  The bathroom has no counters so you'll be brushing your teeth in the kitchen sink.  Our entry cards didn't work had to get t hem replaced 3 times.  I can hear my neighbors conversing and watching TV as if their in my room.  It's so close to the highway the traffic will wake you up constantly.  Electrical is not up to code, the light switches are not Ada compliant and most o f the recepticles are missing covers and are loose.  I will never stay here gain and can't wait til our visit is over.<//Review>

Great vet! Everyone has been so caring for our new puppy Scout and have been super helpful with all of the questions that we have. They are part of the VCA system so you can download the MyVCA app as well as communicate with the Vet through text message which has been really helpful.</Review>

Even though this place has been gobbled up by VCA like so many other vet practices, they have maintained the highest standards. The staff is friendly and compassionate on all calls and ALL of the vets are amazing. When i moved to Novato and got a dog, i thought i might try some practices closer to me but after trying 3, I decided the drive to Corte Madera was well worth it. Because they have quite a few docs, you can almost always get in without the crazy waits I had with other practices. They are the best.<//Text>

I needed a third opinion for a very sick dog that had been treated for almost a month, and was worse.  Several people recommended this clinic.  When I called, I was told that I could get a free first appointment that same day!  The doctor I saw had read the reports and test results from the other vets I'd been to, called me to discuss before the appointment, then listened intently and took ample time when I was seen, did an exam, and sent me home with the clearest most logical course of action I'd received. She was very midful of the fact that I'd already spent over $2,000, and so did not run up a large bill.  I wish I had started with this doctor.</Text>

<Text>We found ourselves in need of a veterinarian after realizing our cat had a serious injury that we hadn't noticed. I called the hospital to get an estimate of the cost and the respondent was calm, kind, and able to provide me with valuable information regarding what options might be taken to address the injury and what they would cost. We were able to get an estimate and schedule an appointment for later that day, and met with one of the newer veterinary doctors.

Highlights of our visitation:
- Great people skills on behalf of staff, were able to reassure us about options and ways to manage injury while acknowledging seriousness and possibilities resulting from wounds. They were able to calm us, but did not attempt to falsely reassure us. They were respectful and professional.
- Frank discussion over options available to treat injuries, the associating costs, and the pros and cons of each.Treated us as active participants in how they could and would like to treat the patient.
- Pointed out additional problems and issues unnoticed at the time (medication updates, mild parasitic infection) and was able to incorporate those into the course of treatment.
- In case it seems like I'm putting too much emphasis on the doctoral staff, the logistics staff was excellent in tracking and assisting us with the necessary information needed to make an appointment and follow up appointments.
- They healed our cat. They got a little animal whose main way of communicating an unnoticed injury was "be quieter and move around less" and helped fix them and let us know how to help fix them so they'd be living a better life and wouldn't be in pain. And then they did it again with the 5+ dog owners that came in after us. That takes skill, heart, and guts.

Thus, five stars. It's not for everyone - it costs something, and we got off lucky with what we needed to pay for. Not everyone is in our financial situation. We were lucky. If you love your pet though, and you're willing to do what needs to be done to help it even if it might be painful or anxious for you, I would look here.</Text>< GmapID>

Top level pet care by top level vets and staff. We love Dr. Tessano and Dr. Farnell and Dr. Robertson, but the others are equally as talented and wonderful. We have been going for fourteen years and they have literally saved the lives of two of our three dogs (the third remains healthy), and one of our cats. They are professional yet compassionate. They know that your pets are family members, yet balance the cost of care with the drawbacks. I have the highest praise for everyone at VCA Madera--the technicians, Vets, etc. If you explain your situation, they will listen and provide you with their best guidance.</Text>

I am a retired Registered Nurse and I find the care toy pet was appalling sloppy and inexperienced.  After many tests and X-rays they were still wanting to do more and more including an MRI.  I feel they use your love for your animal to embellish the bill.  And clearly they are not the place to take your pet if you really care about them.</Review>

All the docs here were just great with my Border Colllie for many years, and handled her end of life gracefully and with great compassion.They made an extremely difficult situation less painful.That was 5 years ago and I still think of them gratefully.< /Text>

I have to say I was not too happy with this location at all. The visit was for a microchip for my puppy, who doesn't like to be without me, so I said I would like for it to be administered in the room so he is more comfortable, being that he had a panic episode once before. I had been questioned very harshly if it was for him or me and I almost felt like I was being interrogated. I know what was best for my pet and if I say it would be best for him I think as his mom I know that. At checkout the woman said since I've been to other VCA's before that the visit isn't complimentary, which isn't true. Then once I was passed off to another register she openly started being rude by talking about her co worker in a not so nice manner. Overall it wasn't a pleasant visit. The only thing I felt comfortable with was the vet assistants that administered the microchip.
When I am in the area again I wont be visiting this VCA!</Review>< gmapID>

I started working for Preferred Healthcare Staffing about a year after graduating Physical Therapy school. I had a full time job and didn't quite feel ready to settle down and wanted to be able to travel and make more money. Vincent Hull, and the entire team, have been absolutely wonderful at making my goals happen. They are nice, friendly, and have time and time again helped me land the settings and locations that I am eager to work in. Thanks guys!</Text>

<review>I've been with Preferred for over a year now and I'm very happy with the services and support they provide. Peyton is great and the entire staff is exceptionally kind. They're always quick to respond to my requests, questions and/or concerns. Some other great perks are that they match 401k contributions and they offer $500 in continuing ed courses if you average a certain number of hours/wk. Overall  it's an awesome company to work for!<//review>< Pictures>

I really didn't know what to expect when looking into it and was initially overwhelmed by all the companies reaching out to me; however,  I am extremely grateful that I was able to join the Preferred Healthcare team. I am just finishing my first assignment which I had a great experience and I am excited to start my second one! Vincent Hull was my recruiter and he was very helpful, knowledgeable about the entire process and made sure I was satisfied with my assignment/placement.

I am a just over a month into my first contract with Preferred and so far everything has been great! I have mostly worked with Vincent who is quick to respond and helpful in making sure I am getting the most out of my placement and that everything is going smoothly. I would definitely recommend others in the PT world to preferred!</Text>

I have worked with Preferred for over three years now. My first 1 1/2 years I had a great experience. My recruiter was outstanding, but unfortunately left the company. My next recruiter also left and then I had the recruiting manager temporarily, which was unfortunately a very bad experience.

I requested a new contact/recruiter and was paired up with Megan. Megan has been great and does her best to be transparent and communicative. I have worked with two other companies prior to Preferred on the east coast who had limited contacts/positions on the west coast. Preferred has a lot of good contacts/placements for California/Pacific NW.</Text>

I enjoyed working with  my former recruiter Laura Durance . She was very attentive to my needs, followed up on my requests quickly and communicated quickly and efficiently via my preferred methods of contact (phone, email or text prior to assignment), email or text during. She was really thoughtful when it came to helping me find my assignments and has always been super friendly when I have seen her at conferences. It is very hard to find that level of attention!<//Review>

Great Company to work to be a part of! I've only been a Travel Therapist for a couple of years and this company fits perfectly with personal and professional goals.

1) I'm a bit bias towards California since I was born here, and intend on exploring as much of it before exploring heading out to the Pacific Northwest. This company has plenty of contracts in California and opportunities to stay in my home state.

2) My recruiter is great and always keeping me in the loop. She works hard to negotiate my contracts for everything I want and place me ASAP as soon as my current contract expires, which I appreciate because I can become very restless in between contracts.

3) Convenience of living in the same time zone! I originally was working for another Travel Company based out of the East Coast and I was always playing phone tag trying to talk to my recruiter in person.< /Text>

<Review>My initial experience with Preferred was a little concerning. The recruiter who had initially been my contact didn't submit my paperwork into the facility I requested and then went MIA for a week or so despite my emails on updates.

I was then fortunately paired with Megan, who has been astounding. The contract company you choose is either a positive or negative experience depending on your recruiter. Megan has been on TOP of it regarding my paperwork and being honest and transparent about the various aspects of contract work (benefits, travel reimbursement, salary, etc).

This is my first time working with a contract OT company but as long as my recruiter is Megan, I think I will continue to work with them until I decide to take a full time position elsewhere.

Transparency: I was offered a gift card to write the review but it wouldn't have mattered because I was going to write one anyways. (=< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< userid>

I appreciate that my recruiter and staffing manager have been genuine, kind, and have kept my best interest in mind from start to finish.

Highly recommended staffing agency and I am looking forward to continue working with them!</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I have worked for three travel therapy agencies and Preferred Healthcare Staffing is, BY FAR, my favorite. My recruiter, Megan, was very proactive and attentive--consistently checking in at least once a week to make sure everything was going well at each of my assignments. Any staff from different departments that I had contact with was always very friendly and helped me get what I needed done so I could maintain my state and national compliance. I have very much enjoyed working with Preferred and hope to continue working with them in the future.<//Text><user>102314286247428752892< /user></record>

I've heard nightmare stories about other agencies, but I seem to have lucked out with this one. The staff keeps in contact with you and won't leave you hanging if you have an issue. They stay on top of things and work to keep you happy. I've been working with Toni, who's been wonderfully personable and hardworking. The only con with PHS is that you have to pay for your own lab work-ups for the hiring process, but that's about it.< /text></record></dataset><record>

This is my second time around working with them, and a much better experience than the first. In the past, there were times when 2-3 weeks would go by w/out any placement. This time, I was placed at an assignment within a week. My recruiter has been efficient, thorough and an active listener (translate: hears what I'm looking for and not just shove any job my way). I've been very pleased so far.< /text>

I cannot say enough amazing things about Preferred. They were always available to hear me out, listened to my goals as a traveler and worked SO HARD to get me the best possible location and setting. I had other agencies I worked for that out me in AWFUL areas but never with Preferred. They also did an amazing job of getting me housing when I had some difficulty finding it. Of all the travel agencies out there, I would only refer my friends and colleagues to Preferred for the best possible experiences!!!</text>

<Review>I have worked for Preferred Healthcare for the past 6 months. I was assisted with finding an excellent placement given my experience and preferences. I have had most all questions and concerns addressed in a timely manner. Preferred has an excellent reputation at my placement for timely communication and referral of excellent PT's.

<text>I had never worked for a registry company before Preferred, but I definitely feel I lucked out with a good one my first shot. I've been with PHS for almost a year now, and have been grateful to have such a communicative and helpful contact person as Tanya, who returns emails promptly and gets in touch with my work site as necessary. Paychecks are always on time and accurate, additional work is always offered if I've been canceled at my main work site, and I've had nothing but a smooth ride!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dbffb14c626ac3:0x2cec31e25584c54<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

It has been a pleasure working with Preferred Healthcare. Recruiter Vincent Hull has been helpful, supportive, personable, and attentive during the entire hiring and on boarding process. Would definitely recommend working with them if you have the opportunity.< /Review>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>This is my first contract with Preferred Healthcare, although Toni also spent substantial time working with me in the past to find the right fitting job (I am very particular about my placements). In spite of my pickiness, Toni has never expressed frustration with me and is always optimistic. She takes the time to explain things and take care of HR tasks that I may have forgotten. Her team is also fairly good at getting things done, and my transition over to Preferred from my last company was relatively smooth.<//Review>< userid>

I have worked for Preferred for more than a year now.  As with any company there are pros and cons, but overall I am very happy with my position and feel they really do put their employees and the quality of care they provide at the top of their priorities.  They offer competitive pay and great benefits.  I would definitely recommend them to a friend.<//text>

My contact, Nikki Dreslik, went above and beyond during the hiring process to ensure that all questions were answered and concerns addressed.  Annual credentialing, timecards, documents are all so easy to submit--WAY easier than my last staffing company.  I plan to work with them long into the future.< /review>< pictures>

I was a traveling PT for about 4 years and mostly worked with Preferred in that time.  The did so many great things for me, here are just a few of their qualities:

1) can always get ahold of someone over the phone same day
2) best pay I've had by 20%
3) they listened to where I wanted to go
4) got me a job in acute care (without prior experience)
5) they did per diem and contracts seamlessly
6) everyone was actually friendly

In five years since graduating, I have worked in two nursing homes (perm), home health (perm), outpatient (perm) and various other settings as a traveler.  Preferred is the BEST travel company.  I recommend them to everyone considering travel PT.

If I ever go back to travel PT work, I will only work with Preferred.  Laura and Kristine were the best.  I even met them in San Diego.  Not many travelers can say they actually met anyone who works at the agency.  Thank you guys for always being there and doing such a wonderful job.  You are AWESOME.</Text>

This is my 1st traveling placement. I was working with a recruiter who unexpectedly left the company 1 month after my placement started and was quickly followed up by Megan who filled me in on the situation and has been communicative, informative, and transparent thus far.

The 1st recruiter was very attentive to my needs and prior to me agreeing to work with PHS followed up with me well and generally continued to maintain communication throughout. I have been paid on time so far and am happy with being paid weekly.

I will say that when filling out documents, the recruiter seemed to not know the purpose of some documents..however, which could have resulted in me not getting my medical/dental/vision benefits (good thing I clarified!). When I asked questions about documents though..he was quick to follow up with more knowledgable workers if he was unsure about answers to my questions. He definitely took the time to answer my questions and was attentive.

I did have 1 questionable experience with this recruiter regarding how certain fees would be covered (license, medical requirements to work, etc). He said that PHS would cover these fees as long as I sent receipts, when in the end, he meant that these fees would be taken out of my paycheck by the hourly rather than an upfront fee.

Overall..my experience has been mostly good so far.</text>

< Review>
Melanie J. Reiten and her office staff are a joke. Preferred is the worst company I have ever worked for, and I've worked in healthcare a long time. Difficult time getting paid, will threaten too destroy your career if you refuse to participate in illegal activities, their idea of housing is a cheap hotel, high turnover rate, poorest pay in the industry, the list goes on. They say they appreciate their therapists, but are really only concerned about not losing their clients. Have contracts with some of the worst rehab companies in the industry.</Review>

They used to be good when they needed you, but as times got tight, they were less cordial.  They sent me to assignments where the DOR expected me to commit fraud when I wasn't able to actually see a patient.  They did not back up their therapists and yes, their contracts are with some of the worst SNF in the O.C.< /text>

<Text>Roadrunner came well-recommended by several of my co-workers and boy were they right!  Brian is a very professional and friendly mechanic/businessman. The office and waiting area was very comfortable and clean and his crew had me in and out his very well maintained shop within 20-25 minutes.  They smog checked my wife's car (it passed) and they replaced one of her brake lights in a snap!
We will definitely be going back for all of vehicles' needs in the future.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

I recommend Roadrunner because Brian's honesty is impeccable he let me know that he has to buy the most cheapest parts he can possibly find from CHINA because he can't make enough money on quality part's. So if you want quality part's and bring in your own parts he will let you know that he's again not making enough money on just his labor even though the two hours he supposedly spent fixing my vehicle was more than what the dealer quoted me. It sure looks like he's making pretty good money to me he can afford to hire a secretary that can't even staple a receipt to the bill.<//Text>

Absolutely the best place to get your vehicle in tip-top shape. Knowledgeable, reasonably priced and friendly. Their work is promptly done and is always right the first time so you can rest assured that you won't be making return trips for the same issue. Brian and his crew are Top Notch!!!<//Review>

So I found this roadrunner on yelp. 5 star can't go wrong. So i reached out and right away I got a response to have my car serviced. Unfortunate for me . I would have to have my check engine light checked out befor my smog. But thank goodness for people like Brian. He updated me on what needs to happen and how much. I eas very pleased on how well and smothly everything went. I get to go back and get my vehicle  smog. Salt of the earth family man and father and boss. I would recommend his services to anyone.

<text>It is so rare in this day and age to find a company and owner who understand what customer service and quality repairs are all about.  Brian went out of his way to help me save money on my smog check by taking the time to go on-line and find the parts I needed and suggestions from his experience about how to do the repairs preparatory to my smog check.  That alone saved me over $300 in parts and labor!

I can't say enough good things about Roadrunner.  I would recommend them to anyone who asked; confident they would have a great experience.  g</text>< pictures>

<Review>I live in Nevada and my truck broke down on my way to CA. Roadrunner was recommended by a friend and my tow service got it there about 730 at night. By 815 the following morning, Brian had an initial diagnosis on it but was swamped with already ongoing work & told me he couldn't get to it till Monday. I had business in the area so not a big deal. Monday morning he called me with a full diagnosis that was a much happier outcome then Friday and by 230 Monday afternoon had me back on the road! I cannot praise this place highly enough, kind, professional, honest, quick service. If I lived in the area, they would be my full time shop.< /Review><user_name>Purple Sage Equine<//user_name><Time>1581526235186<//Time>< userid>

Pleasantly surprised by the quick service, knowledge and friendly service. I selected this place on line with no referrals or experience of Roadrunner Automotive. I was satisfied and would return.

If someone is looking to purchase a vehicle I highly recommend this place, he definatly is honest and trustworthy. My daughter bought a car from him a few days ago & he was trying to find something out about the vehicle, that was working earlier before we came but all of a sudden stopped. he worked on it for about 2 hrs and while we waited he took me and my 2 daughters across the street & bought us all lunch. But that isn’t it he told us once we drive home from San Leandro to Fairfield the battery should charge and problem fixed however once we got back it wasn’t fixed. I notified him and instead of him saying sorry
“sold as is” He told us to take car to his michanic and not worry about the cost he would take care of it so today that is what we did. Michanic worked on car for about 3-4 hours and fixed everything we did not have to pay a dime. The gentleman at roadrunner automotive took care of everything. To me this is going far and beyond what this man was required to do considering once the car is taken off the lot it is sold as it. I’ve also read other good reviews on this man and I would highly highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a used car.</text>

<review>I've been to Roadrunner twice, and both times the service has been great, the work excellent, and the price very reasonable. We had taken the car to a local dealer because a warning light had come on, and the dealer suggested some very expensive repairs that ended up not being the real reason for the light. Brian was able to diagnose the real issue and fix it, as well as do additional work we needed for a lot less than what the dealer wanted. Most important is the fact that he's honest and straightforward, and being able to trust your mechanic is everything. Highly recommended.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate>< user_name>

<review>I was referred to Brian at Roadrunner Automotive by Bob at Karl's Smog and Repair.

Brian did what was required to make sure that my car would pass the smog test when I took it back to Bob.

While I was at Roadrunner Automotive, I told Brian that my car, a 2006 Nissan Altima with 123,000 miles, was making noises and that the steering wheel vibrated badly when I applied the brakes. Since I know nothing about cars, I told Brian that I would have to rely on his expertise. He put the car on the rack and told me exactly what the problems were. I needed brakes, front and rear, the left front wheel bearing needed replacement and several other items needed to be fixed. Brian did everything that was needed at a very reasonable price.

I was very impressed with Brian's knowledge and his commitment to make sure that all of the necessary repairs were done to make my car safe to drive. I also appreciated that he explained everything to me in a way that I could understand. He did not try to sell me anything that was not needed. I had confidence in him, and I knew that he was a person of integrity who could be trusted to do what was right for me..

I would strongly recommend Roadrunner to everyone who wants to get their car repaired by an honest, reliable and reasonable mechanic. Brian is NUMBER ONE in my book.

I would also tell anyone who needs to get a smog check to go to Bob at Karl's Smog and Repair; he is the GREATEST.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809b70e0f38eeb83:0xfc2bcce3aa1851c7<//Gmap_id></record>

Knowledgeable, friendly, fair and ETHICAL!  I've come to realize that you do indeed get what you pay for, so when shops have good reputations and price is close, service and people win.  Roadrunner has the best people, fair and honest, they straight shoot you, not trying to oversell you anything you don't need.  Will continue going for routine maintenance as well as the oopsies, highly recommend them!  Oh, and when you use a credit/debit card a portion of those fees are getting donated to a local charity!< /Text>

< Review>
We have taken several of our vehicles to Roadrunner Automotive for service and repair. Brian, the owner of Roadrunner Automotive, is extremely knowledgeable and focused on getting the job done right the first time. We especially appreciate his skill at diagnosing and troubleshooting errant problems that crop up on our vehicles from time to time. We've recommended him to friends and have heard only positive reviews back. In short, Roadrunner Automotive does a good job and is also fast and affordable.</Review>

This is a business that deserves your patronage.< /text><GmapID>0x809b70e0f38eeb83:0xfc2bcce3aa1851c7< /GmapID>< time>

They will call you day prior to send you your tickets legitimately through a website like AXS (app) once you establish an account (it takes a minute). I didn’t have a bad experience. I purchased tickets through TicketSMARTER (not TicketMaster). They called me twice day prior (I missed the calls). and morning of day event to transfer tickets. We got BETTER seats than what we paid for. It’s a risk , but it turned out great for us.</Review>< pics>

<review>Darren and the crew he works robbed people of their money. Not only is there a hidden $250 fee applied after tickets are purchased but they wouldn't give anyone a refund for over a year, held our money captive and then transferred the tickets to ticketmaster so he doesn't have to deal with us anymore. Don't purchase anymore tickets from these evil people. Help them rot and go out of business.< /review><Rating>1< /Rating><user_name>N D</user_name><resp>None<//resp><user>106887574944236185347< /user>< pictures>

<Review>DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
Bought tickets for a concert
Concert date was postponed and then eventually canceled. We received NO notice, other than see a refund, minus service fee, on my account.
I called to ask why a full refund was not returned.
A fellow, saying his name was Mr. Green, just blabbered on and on, not listening to my questions regarding a FULL refund. He said read your terms of agreement.
I then advise, no service was rendered and I would report this to the authorities. He said he would refund the balance from his own pocket.
Just received the balance money today.< /Review>< Pics>

They are such an atrocious business that the only thing they are good at are being belligerent and condescending. Their “customer complaint” department is probably larger than their sales department. They prey on confusing people. They prey on people who are distracted when buying legitimate tickets. They’re ruthless. You’re at Ticketmaster or other legit sites and click one wrong link and then you get diverted to one of their 3rd party sites. FYI they have tons of 3rd party sites that are linked to them. Then this 3rd party site is made to replicate Ticketmaster and other legit sites. It’s fraud by deception.<//text>< time>

When I was purchasing tickets to the Juice Wrld concert at The Greek Theater, to surprise my son for his birthday, they led me to believe that the three tickets that I was purchasing were three rows from the stage, which I was happy to pay a premium price for.  I think we ended up paying about $800 in total for all three seats.  When we got to the event, the tickets were literally in the last bench, not even three seats, a bench mind you, all the way at the top of the stadium.  I would be very CAUTIOUS and CAREFUL dealing with All Access Tickets.  Buyer Beware!  There are a lot more ethical and reputable companies around that you can do business with.<//review>

We just wanted to thank you and the All Access Tickets team for a great job regarding our recent event in Amsterdam. As you know I spoke to all the other ticket agents prior to speaking to you and I chose you guys because of your personal touch and flexibility. All the way through any problems that did arise we met by the words 'Let me see what I can do for you" and then promptly sorted out. We'll definitely be working with you again and we will gladly recommend you to our friends.Thanks< /text>

Great service; all tickets as represented.  Prices are greater than face value in the secondary resale markets and All Access is very open and transparent about that.  When concerts are sold out, you really have no choice except to enter the secondary resale market if you want to grab tickets to a sold out show<//text>

Consumers should pay close attention to fees which All Access fails to disclose until just before you click "Purchase".   The fees are extremely high, thus escalating the purchase price from the realm of reasonable to rather high.   The tickets, both times I used this company, were accurately represented.   Other than the fee issue, which is a big issue, I was satisfied.<//text>

All Access upgraded our tickets unsolicited.  We had paid a significant amount for two tickets to an event, but All Access provided us markedly better tickets at no extra cost to us.  This was our first time using All Access.  We will definitely use it again.<//Review>

we ended up paying over $400 for $85 tickets. They would not give us our money back. When we spoke to someone, they told us to get in touch with their insurers.
We appreciate that last minute sales deserve an increase in price, and people have a right to make a bit from the opportunity, but this is just out and out greed. We are thinking of going to see our Congressman to try get this kind of profitability outlawed. I shall never use their services again.< /Text>

<Text>Parking is the worst at the Virginia Beach Veterans Amphitheater.  We wasted our money on the Summer Country fest tickets.  We waited in our car for over an hour last night at Luke Bryan just to enter the parking lot only to be rerouted out of the lot to the main road.  No more parking.  They must have over sold the concert.  We never saw the concert.  The parking attendants were all very very young and did not know what to do.  This is a major problem and must be addressed by the managers of the venue.  If Kenny Chesney fails next week, we will never go back again.  I would like a refund.</Text><user>114841634087655513227</user>< username>

I purchased two tickets through them before tickets went on sale to public. I was charged $460 total for 2 tickets! They bought the tickets from the website the day the tickets were made available to public and sent me a printed copy of the tickets, with the price they paid and everything. For 2 tickets they only paid $60, so they made $400 off me! When I tried calling them to complain they first didn't answer, then had some answering service call me back and tell me that someone would be in contact with me in next 24 hours. Never heard from them again!   DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE! If this is how they do business, you're better off buying the tickets yourself cause they obviously don't get any special perks.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Never and I mean NEVER buy tickets from this company!!!  Always, always shop around buy from anyone else.  My FIL got rapped buying tickets from them.  Paid literally 5 times more for the same seats than all the other companies combined.  When we spoke to them about it their customer service was absolutely astonishing!!!  Never EVER have I heard someone treat another so RUDELY ever!!!!  This goes for the management as well.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!!!</Text>

<Review>Seems to be a scam. Paid nearly 700 bucks for two "front row tickets." Got to the venue. Turned out I had two 25 dollar tickets. At least they got me seats, though.

Texted the seller -- they'd been trying to text me to okay a fedex, which was strange -- and he said "trust me. No mistake." He gave me a number to call but that number just puts you into a long list of ads and surveys.

Scam, scam, scam.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Horrible experience.

I bought 2 separate tickets to a concert that were not side by side seats. I asked the ticket seller if they could find me 2 tickets that sit together I would prefer those. They gave my initial tickets away without securing 2 other seats. They only found me 2 more tickets 1 hour before the concert began. I could not accept them because I had missed my only transportation to the venue which was over 2 hours away. Instead I asked for a refund becuase I chose not to go to the venue; they said they could not garauntee finding me tickets so it would have been senseless to travel 2 hours for nothing. I was not granted a refund ($750) because they said all they had to do was "find me tickets before the concert started" and it would not be their responsibility.<//Review>

<Text>Absolutely awful. I was overcharged for two tickets to a concert ($600.00) tickets that I thought were $60. When I saw charges on account, I immediately called and was told they would correct. It went into a two - three week fiasco and a call to Texas Attorney General Office. Their claim was I should have known...but my confirmation email did not show charged price. This should have been a clue, but after weeks of wrangling with the owner, promises made and finally a call from TX Atty General, they refunded $200.00. They are completely a scam company. By the way...this was a Charlie Wilson concert ...not Beyoncé!!!</Text>< pics>

Very upsetting experience paid over $600 for two tickets to a concert that I was able to find the same tickets with better seats from the actual concert vendor for $25. That is a pretty ridiculous price increase for a ticket site that says they don't add fees.<//Review>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Bought tickets through this company to see the killers in Las Vegas on Feb 3rd. I've been to every killers concert in Las Vegas since their first album. After the mass shooting on October 1st in Las Vegas we decided we do not feel safe going to a concert in Las Vegas any longer and called for a refund. Here are some of the things that were said to us by managers Alex and Darrin from All access Tickets.
"We don't refund tickets because your scared, plus the concert is 6 months away from now" "29,999 other people are not afraid to go to the concert so you shouldn't be either" "you should have bought ticket insurance for this exact reason" yeah like we knew someone would shoot 58 people at a concert. Darrin equated this to the same as being in a car accident for a reason to not want to attend a concert. Darrin is lost in the money behind this company and cares about nothing else and no one else. Bottom line this company is heartless, ruthless, and completely disconnected to their client base. After Darrin telling me if I actually called the merchant who took our payment I could get a refund through them that was untrue also, as they have to have approval from All Access Tickets to give the refund which Darrin would not provide. Tracey the manager of the company who took our payment said that All Access Tickets doesn't think they can sale the 2 tickets in the 6 month timeframe and that it's too close to the date of the concert, yet 6 months time according to Darrin is enough time to feel comfortable attending a concert after the biggest tragedy in our city's history.  Darrin also offered to resale the tickets for me even though he feels that 6 months timeframe to refund them is not an appropriate amount of time to garner a refund, makes total sense right? Never ever ever buy tickets from All Access Tickets or Ticket Liquidators.< /text>< Pics>

I thought i was ordering my tickets directly through ticket master so you can imagine my surprise when I received my bill and was charged in US $$. We proceeded anyway as it was a concert we won't be able to attend again.
Was told tix would be emailed to me the week before the concert so when I hadn't received anything by Tuesday (concert was Sunday) I called to follow up. I was told there was a slight back log but I should have by Wednesday.
Friday rolls around so I called again and was apparently to the manager. He was pleasant enough and explained there was a technical issue hence the delay and i should have them by 8:30 that evening. By 1 pm EST Saturday, I hadn't received anything yet (keeping in mind with Exchange it cost us $1540 for 4 tix) so I simply called for an update. When I was put through, the same manager came on the phone and started ranting at me how they are still working on the problem and I would have my tickets that day...No hello, greeting, nothing. I didn't even get a chance to say hello. I was pretty patient and understanding until he answered the phone so incredibly rude. So i pointed out we were just a little anxious as we had paid quite a lot of the tix already and his response was, do you want a refund? No I didn't want t refund, i just wanted my tickets. We hung up and my phone rang a few minutes later and it was HIM calling me back to inform me that they were/are on the west coast and they had actually been open for 1 hour as it was only 10am there and i would have my tickets that day...again being very abrasive and rude. I had no idea they were on the west coast and clearly it was irritating him enough to call ME back...He was a total douche and if I had thought for one second I could get tickets or ever see the Tragically Hip live again, i would have told him to stick his tickets. That being said, I will never use this company again as even if you're patient (sorry for following up) and I wasn't rude when I called they treated me very poorly. NOT good customer service at all.
Order through anyone else if you can!!</Review>

Excellent buying and purchasing experience with my recent tickets for the 2016 Jimmy Buffett I don't know tour at the Warf in Orange Beach, AL. The seats were awesome  and definitely worth the price or cost of the tickets. Thanks and look forward to doing it again.< /review>

What a SCAM!!  We purchased tickets to a Christian concert, of all things (Hillsong United May 9th concert). Over $500 each for really good seats they said. So stupid. I thought we were buying from the venue site.  When I later contacted the actual venue site, they said that outfits pay big bucks to get listed first on web searches, and that they are helpless to do anything, and that people get fooled. Its really crafty as I entered the venue site, but the scammers hijacked their name and made it look like the actual venue!  When we attended the event, we found that our tickets were really only $90 each. What a scam!  I had second thoughts after buying the tickets and called them for a refund, which they refused and said that they could not do, but would give us back $100 refund per ticket, which they did.  Whooppee!!  What a racket!!  Certainly not very Christian!!  I guess God will take care of them for cheating those who were worshipping Him..  Really sad,< /Text>

Old school ticket scalpers, just like used car salesmen.
Try to get something resolved and they will not budge an inch and act very aggressively with you. Stay away.<//text>

Even with just 3 cars in line, still took around 15 min to get car washed. Also, no blow dryer so expect to get water stains. The angle of the drive to enter makes it impossible to input code without getting out of car.</review>

ABOUT DRYING: the employees told the Santa Monica City doesn’t allow them to have drying option because of the noise! So, it is not gas station fault... Complain to the city... But without knowing it I would be mad too. The car wash itself is pretty good. Anyway always after any other car wash with dryer I have to wipe it out still.<//Review>

Paid $10. Very poor wash. It’s so bad that I am inclined to believe that the machine malfunction. Not going to be returning.< /Text>

Came to LA Bodega since I was told they sell really good meat, but since covid-19 is a serious think to take care, these guys all were wearing a mask but on them that was processing the meat wasn't wearing the mask properly, this is a concern that should be handled more serious ND that worker should be send home for a few days.
I brought it up in a friendly manner to his supervisor and the cashier lady but instead they followed me to the packing lot and start recording me as I was driving out the parking lot.</review>

They have cheese produce even mesquite charcoal, come here and get your"Carne Asada" started. They also have lots of great seasonings for your meat, come check them out you won't regret it.<//review><GmapID>0x80c291a7816372d5:0xc3d8abb55a741eca< /GmapID>< user_name>

Now this is an old-fashioned butcher shop. You can just get about any cut of meat you want any amount very good fresh USDA quality. This is a Mexican meat market Warehouse. Original products from Mexico candy, soda cheese's. Haven't seen a meat market like this in a very long time. Next time I have a barbecue I've got to remember to come here to buy my meat.< /review>

Cashier's attitude is worse then the worst DMV workers, doesn't bother to help you, takes her sweet time without acknowledging the line / customer, other workers seem nice.

Spanish
The attitude of the lady who charges is worse than the worst DMV workers. It doesn't help you and it takes your blessed time ignoring the line and dispatching you
But the others look good people.

Sold me a defective light knowingly! When contacted back they said that they would send someone out to take a look at it. After a week of them canceling and not showing up I asked to return it. Paid them cash and they insisted on giving me back a check! Horrible service along with even worse customer service. Buyers beware! Make sure you test it out before you even give them a penny or you will get a run around from them.<//Text>

Horrible service. I bought a tail light from them in November. The part was defective, I sent it back. It's been almost three months, and still no refund. Then they go out of the way to tell me it is my fault, that maybe my technicians are installing the tail light incorrectly. Then they decide to send me a video of how the part was working "perfectly fine" (BUT THE VIDEO THEY WAS SENT WAS FOR THE WRONG SIDE TAIL LIGHT). They still refuse to accept there mistake, give me a run around on my refund,  and not a single call back. Do not purchase anything from these people, I have reported them to BBB. Don't worry I reported them to my credit card company too.</Review>

<Text>Really deserves ZERO stars. I bought a 2015 Kia Optima 2.4l engine from Marco and everything ran smoothly until I take it to my mechanic and find out they gave me a 2016 engine. I called and they said they would swap the engine with the proper year make and model but it’s been a month now. They constantly tell me they’re going to have an engine next week, they’ll call me back but NEVER do and so finally I went to return the engine but they couldn’t give my money back because the boss “Mike” (I’ve only talked to on the phone. Don’t know how he looks) just left with ALL the money (It’s only 2PM) and so I’m waiting there and call the boss and he’s saying he has to call his “boss” to see if he can give me my refund I’m entitled to because they messed up and I gave them more than enough time to find the proper engine to swap. And now they’re avoiding my calls and don’t want to deal with me. WORSE BUSINESS and CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!! They just want your money.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

So I called in ask for the part repeated my self twice just to make sure drove 20 miles over just so they can tell me that part is not in stock but you can go somewhere else for extra hundred bucks. Obviously these people don't know what they're doing.<//text>

<Text>We purchased a used seat for our vehicle. Initially our experience was great. TCD texted photos of the item to confirm the condition and details.
Our item arrived via freight - damaged. I contacted TCD and was told to file a claim with the carrier. I did. The carrier denied our claim- stating that TCD did not package it correctly. I called TCD back and they said the carrier never should have accepted the package of it wasn't packed correctly and gave me ANother Number to call. That person failed to follow up with me. I am a small biz owner. When one of your contractors  fails to provide the service you hired them for it is not the clients responsibility to chase down the contractor for restitution. It is yours. You hired the contractor - you selected and paid them. You fix their mistakes with your customer and then work it out between you and the vendor or co tractor. Wish that TCD would have done right by me<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<review>When I inquired about his current contactors license and insurance,he got hostile and defensive,saying"I've worked with a lot of large contractors and NEVER HAS ANYONE EVER ASKED FOR MY LICENSE!!!!!" I asked if he could bring proof at the time of the appointment for my residence,and he cancelled. My time is precious and I had this appointment booked for two weeks. I also was offered to work that day from my employer and I turned it down for this appointment. I lost money and time due to his attitude.
There is no need to get condensending to a potential customer. I have the right to ask ANY CONTRACTOR about their current license for my protection. I don't care how long you have been in business.
Never been treated so rude!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Where compassion and professionalism come together to provide incredible customer service!

I cannot give Able Electric enough stars to truly express my satisfaction.  Joe and Justin represented Able Electric for an emergency service call after our solar panels caught our roof on fire on a Friday afternoon.  Working late into the evening, they provided a safety check for us "treating our family and home like it was their own."  True to their word, they would not leave until they were satisfied we could all sleep at night.

Whether you are in need of routine or emergency service, I hope you consider Able Electric for your electrical contractor needs.  I suspect your experience will mirror ours and you will be completely satisfied as well.<//text><Gmap_id>0x809442d4e4cd0959:0x107b2be173cea2b5< /Gmap_id><user_name>Sheri Mauro< /user_name>< UserId.>

I would recommend this company and will continue to use them when ever a problem arises again.  Many companies were called for help and Able Electric was the only company that responded to our problem.  The 2 employees were great.  I would recommend Able Electric 100%.<//Review>< Pics>

I recently called Able Electric to see if they could install a 240v/60amp circuit for our electric vehicle. Since our service panel is on the opposite side of the house, I knew it was going to be a complicated job. Joe & Peter came out the next day to take a look, and I was really happy when they got back to me with a reasonable estimate. The job ended up being even more complex than anticipated, however they took it all in stride and went above & beyond to get it done. Despite the extra, unexpected work, I was pleasantly surprised that they stuck to their original estimate. Their work was very professional and I'm grateful that they were willing to explain everything to me along the way. I would absolutely reach out to them again with any electrical needs and recommend them to anyone in the area.< /text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>Things I had done on my house include: installing a new video doorbell, installation of a new range hood, hanging some conduit for an outdoor switch and the mounting of a television.

Joe and Peter took over the business and they are a great team.  Communicate really well and very professional.  With the video doorbell and the mounting of the TV, they ran into a couple of challenges, but they are incredibly knowledgeable and were able to overcome the small challenges.  One of the challenges that was presented caused some additional time for the job and offered to come back on a Saturday, flexible to my schedule, to finish the job.  I would recommend these guys in a heartbeat to anyone.  If and when the time comes, I will definitely be reaching out to them again.<//review><GmapID>0x809442d4e4cd0959:0x107b2be173cea2b5</GmapID>< Resp>

< review>
At 5:45am this morning, I saw and heard what I thought was a short in my electrical socket it the living room. for 3 to 5 seconds I heard a loud crackling sound and saw a 2 foot column of fire rise from the socket. I was sure considerable damage had been done. I called Able Electric at 8:15 and Russell, owner/operator, arrived at 9:30. He examined the socket and quickly diagnosed the problem. He explained to me, in terms I could understand, what the problem was. He then told me the damage was superficial and proceeded to fix the problem. He was quick and very efficient. Then I was charged a very reasonable amount. Russell was not only very good at his repairs, he was also a very friendly person. I am very happy to give him  5 stars and highly recommend him.</review>

<Text>I just have to take my hat of to this electrician. He was willing to DROP everything and come meet my needs when I had a house fire. He was willing to come out and take on my insurance when everyone else didn't wanna do the job or they was to busy. He is an outstanding guy and he has very good and reasonable rates too. Not expensive either. Thanks man for dropping everything to come rescue my needs when nobody could be bothered for days or weeks.

Russell came out to our home in short notice and even skipped his lunch to help figure out why part of out home had no electricity.  He spent a couple of hours to diagnose the problem and even switched out a faulty plug at no charge.  He did not charge us until the problem was solved.  He is extremely knowledgeable and reputable.  I can recommend him for no reservation.<//Text>

<review>I called able electric by random not knowing what kind of service I would receive. And what a blessing I did. Not only did the owner show up but brought his wonderful wife with him because she was concerned for me getting the repair done so I could have peace of mind. If you want the job done right and you want to deal with only honest caring professional people that offer excellent service you can trust then don't bother to call anyone else for electrical repairs. I was So totally impressed with the kindness and work repair done. Thank you Russel !< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I am super impressed with Able Electric.  Russel, the owner is kind, fast and very informative.  I called him this morning because every time my AC came on the main power breaker on my house would trip.  He had me take a couple pics and text him then he had the new breaker and was at my house that evening.  I would HIGHLY recommend him!  I now have an electrician I can trust for all my future needs.

<Review>Russell is amazing to say the least!!! 8 o'clock on a Saturday night I called and within 5 minutes he called back!! Within 1/2 hour he was there. I screwed up something at my parents new house rewiring the place and he figured it out in a very short time tracing everything I did. This man is very polite and he is highly recommended. If there were more than 5 stars i would give him at least 10!!!👍👍</Review><Gmap_id>0x809442d4e4cd0959:0x107b2be173cea2b5</Gmap_id><response>None< /response>< username>

We had been trying for over a week to get an electrician to come out and repair/replace a dryer outlet in our laundry room. We found Russell of Able Electric and he was a God send! Responded to our call the same day and we were up and running in less than an hour. He went above and beyond what we expected and was incredibly courteous and knowledgeable. True craftsman and customer service expert. Recommending him to everyone we know!<//Text>

<Name>Michael Kirkpatrick<//Name><review>Russell is very professional, courteous, and always shows up on time.  You can call him and he will show up the same day. Great prices, I called several electricians and the price is double for the same work to be done. In this case you get more then what you pay for. Thank you Russell for the great job on getting my problem fixed so fast.< /review>< GmapID>

He explained what he was doing as he figured out the problem. When he found the issue he had the part on his truck. The customer service was off the charts. We'll be referring this company to our friends and family. Thanks Able!< /review>< Rating>

I had called several Electricians on a hot Fresno day and was told by all of them they could schedule me in next week. I called Able electric and he told me he was very busy also but would try his best to stop by that day. I really did not expect a call back. To my suprise Russ called me back a few hours later to tell me he made some time and if I still wanted him to stop by. An hour later my electrical problem was fixed for a reasonable price.</text>

<Review>We had a crisis with our electric panel, resulting in a non functional stove...We called Able Electric at 845 pm, not expecting to get a appointment till tomorrow and he knocked on our door a few minutes later. He solved our crisis in less than 10 minutes!! Russel was very professional and extremely polite! He explained everything that he was doing in a way that the average joe could understand. I would recommend his service to everyone who needs a electrician!!!</Review>< resp>

<Text>Well what can I say, I hardly ever do reviews, but this was definitely one worth mentioning. My garage circuit blacked out and I went in and tried to figure out the solution myself. I came real close according to Russell, who came to my families rescue in the odd hour of the night. He found the problem and solved it within minutes. Sorry google, you don't always have the answer, but you did lead the way to a right one. Thanks again Russell.<//Text><GmapID>0x809442d4e4cd0959:0x107b2be173cea2b5< /GmapID>< Pictures>

CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GREAT THINGS ABOUT RUSSELL! Our electricity started flaring back and forth. We left a message (Sunday) and thought for sure we'd be that way a whole nother day. Nope! He called shortly after and asked simple questions over the phone. I took some pics and sent him and he was on his way shortly after. I had a house FULL OF SCREAMING CHILDREN. My husband and I were babysitting, of course, when all this happened and Russell wasn't phased for a second.  He gave kids stickers and flash lights when he turned the power off. Lol. Great guy, explained everything as he went along. I feel so at ease now that he's looked and repaired our breakers. Even seeing things that never should have been! Even apologizing for people and their work, even though he had nothing to do with it. Loved this guy. This place is our go to electrician now for everything. We just got an electric car too so as we chatted about what was needed. I know who I'll be hiring for that job! Russell...hands down. Guys a genius electrician. Don't think I can trust anyone else now lol.<//text>

We had a house in escrow and another company was working on trying to diagnose an electrical problem with a GFI circuit. The other company advised to have an electrician versed with home electrical to run a new line from the breaker panel. I called Russel at Abel Electric and told him I had an emergency situation because it now needed to be fixed within three days to close escrow. Russel went over that night after finishing his scheduled jobs and worked 2 hours on diagnosing the problem. He came back the next morning to work on the problem even though he was 9 days out on taking new jobs. He was able to find the problem and repair it without running a new line to the breaker box. There is a reason Able Electric has 51 + reviews and 5 stars.<//Text>

Russel was great. Called him saturday afternoon, my mobile home was having power surgess and the main box where the meter was was sizzling and smelled burnt. He came out and determined what was wrong, had to spend the night in the dark thou. But that was ok he got the part the next morning and came right out and fixed the problem. Very friendly , professional, and resonable priced. I highly recommend him.
Thank you Russel for everything...<//Text>

Awful experience, I just had to leave due to observing multiple negative patient interactions in the waiting room alone. Staff snapped at just about everyone in there. Witnessed a yelling altercation between an older gentleman and a staff member. My wife was curtly told to step outside like she had something wrong, saw no posted notices about non patients in the waiting room. These are not people I would trust drawing my blood. There are plenty of other options, I'd advise going somewhere else. I know I will be.</text>

I love this place.  They know what they're doing.  Hit my veins on the first try right away.  Some places they go slow and miss but not here.  Staff is friendly, service is fast, and the office is clean.  Some people posting bad reviews due to social distancing and people not wearing masks but they also can wait outside.<//Review>

I did not feel safe in the waiting room whatsoever. There were more than 6 people in there, and someone walked in without a mask while I was talking with the reception desk. Walk in only during a pandemic? Seriously? For a pathology lab they sure do not know how pathogens spread.<//text>

Unfortunately, I was quite ill and needed lab work. The staff was very kind, professional and efficient. I used to work as a phlebotomist, so I took note of the collection, and I am happy to report all collection was done 100% correctly,  I did not get unnecessary pokes and all my HIPAA rights were protected. I would highly recommend Central Coast Pathology for all blood draw and lab procedure in needs.< /review>

Currently NO SOCIAL DISTANCING POLICIES IN PLACE! when asked about having no policies, they agreed....and ALSO "It's been 2 months...if people cannot figure it out by now..." There were patients there with no masks, no distancing.  IT'S A MEDICAL FACILITY!!!</review>

< review>
Beautiful place to shop. I stopped here months ago but I can say this is a clean shopping center...Vons is the major grocery store with small stores surrounding(I can't remember the names)it. There is a customer bathroom in Vons. Plenty of free  parking...there is a bank inside Vons. I must visit this place again even though I was in/out my experience was pleasant and I felt welcomed.< /review>

No complaints, I had to make a stop in between San Diego and the Bay Area, and this place had pretty clean bathrooms, a Starbucks, and hot food bar complete with friendly staff. I am not from here, but for me personally, I had a good experience. #LetsGuide< /Review>

Okay shops. Vons stopped being courteous. Subway staff are stressed. CVS is the nicest staffed store.  Alas, we need many more shops nearby for 3000 houses.< /Text>

Typical strip mall. I'm just not a big Vons fan. I don't care for stores that use discount cards and there prices always seem higher to me. The plaza has almost every kind of merchant that you might need for common day to day stuff.<//review>

A clean little plaza with just about everything you need, a bank, a supermarket, Subway, a bar and grill - T's Tavern, martial arts school, post office, animal hospital, smoke shop, CVS and I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but each place I visited had friendly service. Oh yeah, and a gas station.</text>

I have no hope for society; hence, the supermarket, this supermarket being a notch above most due merely to socioeconomics, happily provides opportunities for both the good ol' crossin'-of-the-broccoli-offa-the list and a histrionically vacant yet still impacted parking abcess. It's a pleasure to see old people confused by one-way streets spilling out directionlessly into the magnetic quandry of Starbucks, choose one: imbibe inside or drive by, see a park built in 2012 and last maintained in 2009, bank sitting like till at the end, opposite the drugs, gas between.

Yes, I love this supermarket, 5-stars, as it is slightly better than the supermarket I deserve...I guess.<//review>

Great spot right off the Highway. Not many food options, but a quick sandwich from Von's did the trick.< /text>

<Review>Nice small shopping center with Vons, CVS Drug, Subway, Starbuck (Actually two, small one in Vons), Vons station, a Vet hospital, and a sports bar with good Mexican food. Would've given 5 stars but the Pizza hut won't honor the TV Specials or the coupons sent out in the newspapers & mail.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcbddfd57f44c5:0xca63b5c9d5863ffd<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
