Do not apply! Beware it’s a scam!
What a scam! Credit Karma told me I was 95% chance of approval. So I applied, “pre-approved” for $35k. Put in mind my credit 740+ with $387k salary. After they told me I was approved, the asked for Schedule C, E & F, My K1’s, all of my bank statements! 2 weeks in this, they even ask for my bank statements state over $800k - $900k In deposit monthly. This “ bogus bank” “Upgrade” stated that my account balance needs to show 3 times the loan amount so that said my balance is showing $91k they want to see $105k as my current Balance!!??? Why would anyone apply for a loan if that is required for you to have 3 times the amount of money in your account accessible?? What would be the purpose of this loan or to consolidate? This is most shady lender I have ever dealt with! All applicants out there, you have been warned<//Text>

< Review>
I had made a purchase on Nov 17 to a retail store the transaction was approved by Upgrade card. I picked up my item from the retail store on the same day. Today Nov 20, I get a email from the retail store stating that my transaction was declined. I contact Upgrade customer service, after being placed on hold I was told that they are having with transactions being declined not because of insufficient funds on my part but they are having problems with the card. So then I ask what's happening with my transaction I already have the product. Josh said they aren't going to approve because of the card problem they are having. I asked him how they going to correct this once again he doesn't know. Ask to speak with with a manager after being hold again, Josh said no available. When can they call me back, Josh couldn't give me response to that as well. I requested corporate phone number was told there isn't a number. I was given a customer support email address. I said I need to contact corporate this isn't helping. I asked Josh why wasn't I contacted by Upgrade that its a problem with their system why did I have to get contacted by the retailer and not Upgrade. This company has bad customer service I wouldn't get any card from this company. I asked Josh what am I supposed to tell the retailer because he didn't give me any real information.

Once I payoff my balance I will be canceling my card Upgrade. They will not contact you if their is problem. Bad customer service. It's humiliating that I have to contact this retailer about my transaction being declined even though I have the funds available.</Review>

The worst customer service I have ever had to deal with. Also, everyone I spoke with is extremely incompetent. Can’t wait to pay off my loan and never have to deal with this company again.
Oh, and the 5 star reviews have got to be fake!<//Text>

Do not get a loan through Upgrade, they are not an organized company.  I asked them not to do an auto debit once on my account, I called in well in advance before the actual due date & was told I would not get auto debited, well a few weeks later they auto debited.  It's been 5 days and they still have not given me my money back either.  They lie to you, then they lie to you again saying they will correct the situation.  I reported them to the FDIC.  HORRIBLE customer service lying to your customers.</text>

Getting this loan was easy and painless. I just submitted my request online. They got back to me right away and told me what items I needed to submit(we're talking driver's license, bank statement, etc). Then they called me to verify my information and make sure I understood the loan terms. Within hours I was approved. Thanks to them, I was able to pay off my high interest credit cards with a much lower interest loan. I can easily make the payments. This was a good decision for me.</Text>

I honestly thought this would come to nothing. In less than 30 minutes I had the documentation filed out, loan was approved and a few days later money was in my personal account. Easy, reasonable interest and HONEST company!!! Simply amazing. I borrow money daily in my business which is secured by assets and I've never encountered such a smooth transaction.</Review>

I didn't like the high interest on my credit cards...23.99%, 22.99%, and 20.99. I took out a loan at Upgrade that would let me pay down my credit cards so my monthly minimum payment on each is now only $25.00. I do have a monthly payment now for the loan but their APR is at 13.55% which will save me quite a bit of money. Additionally there is no prepayment clause. I will be able to pay more than the minimum and that will also save me money. The online application process is easy to complete. I filled out the application on a Saturday and the money was deposited in my bank on Monday. And, best of all, my credit cards will be nearly paid off by Tuesday! Highly recommend.</review>

<review>Fast and quick service. Funds deposited in less than 2 days. Good interest rate. I would of liked a lower rate but my credit rating was not very good.  I tried prosper, lending tree, best egg and so-fi. Upgrade was clearly the best option. I would definitely recommend them in the future.< /review>< pics>

I probably had the best loan application/processing experience ever with Upgrade. Within 24 hours of submitting my application; I was approved, easily submitted my verification documents, and had the money in my account the next day! I also got a very competitive rate. Thank you Upgrade for helping me reach my financial goals, and for making it one of the best experiences ever...!< /Review>

Took out a consolation loan to pay off all my small credit cards. Process was quick and easy. Everything done online. Started the process and got the money I needed in 5 business days. Repayment plan is better than what I was paying.< /Review>

Upgrade has outstanding service. I needed extra money for home repairs and was approved within 24 hours and deposit was made in less than 3 days. I was worrying about what to do about the repairs but Upgrade was there for us and made the process simple and stress free. Thank you upgrade!</text>

After running my credit twice and submitting all necessary documents from what was a statically on the outside to be a guaranteed loan for 10,000 this company had no respect for the fact of me being a victim of ID theft and asked me a question that did not pertain to me in the slightest in order to boilerplate did Nite me and continue on with. There program of curbing . Tensional borrowers should be given the chance to prove their identity in different formats considering the circumstances in this company chose to show no sympathy but yet ran my credit lowered my score and wasted my time.</text>

I was trying to decide if I wanted to pursue a loan to pay off some credit card debt.  When I investigated it further I found Upgrade to have by far, the best rate.  Once I began the process I couldnt believe how hassle free and simple it all was.  I had the money in my account within 2 days.  Thank you Upgrade!<//text>

<text>Upgrade has perfected the loan industry. Pre approval took less than 60 seconds. Interest rates are unbelievable; received 4.66% on a personal loan (meanwhile other websites couldn’t get below 9-11%). Received funds after the next full business day, took less than 48 hours for the entire process. I have highly recommended Uprgrade to all my coworkers and anyone reading this review.</text><Pics>None</Pics></record>

<Review>Filled out an application and uploaded proof of income documents. I really don't have any issue with them not offering me a loan. Not even a little bit. I get that I probably did't meet some part of their criteria. But I had to call them every day for two weeks for them to tell me they wouldn't be able to give me the loan when its a fact they could have told me this on day two. A total of 3 weeks they ignored responding to the application. Most receptionist struggled to find the person responsible for my case and many struggled with things like transferring phone calls to loan agents. I feel like they un-needingly waste peoples time and energy. I would not recommend this company to anyone and would stick to big companies that know what they're doing.<//Review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

Applied for a loan, but was denied because they "couldn't verify my income" due to the fact that the lady couldn't calculate.  My net pay is well over $50,000 but according to her calculations my "gross pay" doesn't even exceed $40,000, so they denied me.  Garbage.  Look elsewhere.< /Review>

I waited too long to try this spot!

And food trucks feel like the perfect pandemic solution right now!!

I order the falafel over rice and my husband orders the lamb!

The falafel is so tasty! We both order spicy!! Who'd have thought lettuce would taste so good with rice ? Those sauces are amazing and the textures mix so well

As for the lamb my husband found it super tender and tasty to eat!

The portions are also incredibly generous, I had it for lunch and dinner!

I can't imagine there's many places that you can get a full meal including a drink for $10

The service is friendly and fast ! Overall the perfect spot to grab lunch on the go / near campus</Text>

<text>Food is delicious! Always a long line but worth the wait. Definitely recommend getting lamb and chicken mix with extra meat for those gains. I’m not at Davis anymore, but sometimes think of traveling the 7 hours for this.<//text>< user>

As a mechanical engineer, Shah's was the go-to lunch since it was next to Bainer. It was and still is the best halal food I've had. Great taste and perfect portion size. If you're new to Davis, student or not, stop by this place. Super delicious food and employees are super nice.</Review>

Hands down my favorite spot to eat in the Sacramento area. I crave it often and frequently make the 30 minute drive to get it. I usually order half chicken half lamb over rice (spicy) with pita bread. They take credit cards now which is convenient, and the guys running it are great. I just wish there were more locations, specifically in Sacramento. Everyone should know the deliciousness of Shah's Halal Food. Such a gem.<//text>

<review>Four years after I finished my undergrad at Davis, I found Shah's hiding in the University Mall parking lot. Mixed over rice with spicy and their secret white sauce was as delicious as ever. If you're ever around Davis, stop by the Shah's food truck to get a bite of one of the tastiest meals around campus.<//review><user>109976430986765865424</user><rating>5</rating></record>

<text>An honest review.
This place used to be good but not anymore.
Their food is an average Mediterranean food.
Prices are going up every single year by 1 to 1.5$.
Meat portion significantly less as it used to be. Now you will get more rice and lettuce compare to meat.
Customer service is ok. They have new person each week and some are ok, some are not ok.
Today I bought a meal I ask for more meat and less rice and extra spicy. They charge me 3 $ extra for extra meat and 25 cents for hot sauce.
For a 10$ meal paying 3.25$ extra is insane.
I am not arguing for the price. The person never communicated with me for extra $ amount.
I was like you should have told me that you will charge 3$. Not a good experience at all.</text><name>sohail khalid<//name></record>

Delicious food. I always get the falafel over rice with extra sauces. They offer a free soft drink or water with the purchase of your meal. Line can get very long during peak hours, but they get the food out to customers as quickly as possible.< /Review>

The food will make you full and save on money if you eat out daily. We had falafel gyro, chicken gyro and lamb over rice. The price seemed a bit expensive for students but it comes with soda or water and the amount of food WOULD last until dinner or you may even skip or have little dinner afterward. BIG portion of food and delicious. When you ask for spicy, it is really spicy! :p
The brothers are friendly and courteous. They are located at Arco Gas station.</Text>

<review>Very popular place on campus.  Be prepared to stand in line between 11 and 1:30.  Chicken and rice is good.  Fries are good too.  Food comes with a beverage (fountain soda or bottle of water).  If you order falafel, be prepared to wait for your food.  They don't know if there is wheat in the falafel (there probably is), and they don't know what oil is used for frying.  The people working there could be nicer.< /review>< pictures>

<time>1613754761146<//time><Text>I've been ordering protein powder from this bakery for many years, but the last order (placed on January 14, 2021) was never sent. They initially said the delay was due to covid but that can't be the truth. Other businesses are back on track now. If they have gone out of business they should just say so, and refund our money.

Revised on Friday, February 19: This product was finally delivered on February 18. Took over a month, but my faith is at least partially restored. Glad to see you back Julian Bakery!< /Text>< user>

I've been waiting for a shipment since the beginning of January, with customer service non-responsive over messenger or phone, and broken communication which does not really address my questions via email. I'm done. Do I love the pro granola? Yup. Do I have to have it? not like this.<//Text><userid>102876753780043119083</userid></record></dataset><record>

I have ordered countless boxes of the Sweet Cream bar for YEARS. I’ve purchased through Amazon, and direct with the company. In both places I’ve received bars that are molding. It used to happen infrequently, but then, most recently, I got two boxes of moldy bars. I contacted them about one box (the only one I knew was moldy at the time) and after sending MULTIPLE photos (they wanted pictures of EVERY bar! No way I have time for that!), they finally refunded me. However, I reached BACK out about the other box, and I’ve heard nothing. After years and years and so many boxes of bars.... I’m done. :(< /review>

I ordered on Amazon. I opened and contacted Julian Bakery who referred me to Amazon. Well turns out I had until June 7th so Amazon will not refund me. They also would not let me share pictures with review. $14 and I didn’t even try them. Horrible experience and I will do reviews anywhere I can. Buyer beware< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I have always loved Julian Bakery's ProGranola. However, the most recent time I ordered it, the bag was squeezed into a tiny box and the majority of the granola was crushed. I was ignored the first time I reached out to their customer service and denied any kind of reimbursement or replacement when I finally got in touch. They literally had me send PICTURES of the damaged granola only to tell me that this is because its handmade. If that was the case why even ask me to send pictures of the crushed granola?? After going back and forth they finally offered me a 15% discount off my next order. Since I will never be buying anything from this company again this is not helpful at all. Instead, I just wasted $18 on a bag of crumbs. DO NOT BUY!!!!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1619787142703, 'text': 'I am so sorry this happened please let me make it right.

The tracking number says the package has a label,  but there has been no movement at all in 6 days. Useless response to emails. Very frustrating.

EDIT: Added March 9, 2021 Hilarious that the response I received from posting this review was "please email me so I can make it right" when I have sent 4 emails already. Somehow I don't think emailing you will make any difference at all. :(</Text>< Pictures>

Ordered a protein powder, immediately got a shipping notice, and then the tracking number never moved. I finally emailed after 3 weeks(trying to be patient with Covid) and, they did get back to me. They refunded my money AND still sent me the product, which is an amazing protein powder. I feel that they did go out of their way to remedy the issue with shipping.< /Review>

I placed order 3 week's ago.....of course charged right away for product. Received no update....no response to emails, voice message provides sad story of being understaffed and only able to reply via email..
Oh, it says replies to emails will be made within 24 hours...
HA HA HA HA ........
Read carefully before placing any orders for I am only one of many...
I, all g with many others have deemed this a "rip off site"
GOOD LUCK! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!</Review>

<Text>I am lucky that I found this place online. I bought the almond bread directly from Julian Bakery and I am super happy with my purchase. The bread arrived in perfect condition even though it took 15 days since I made the purchase, but at the end, the wait was worth it. Because it is made of almonds, it has this dry taste in your mouth, so I put butter to every slice and voila. This bread is perfect for people on a very strict diet like me, because it has no sugar,  no grains and no gluten. If you’re looking for something different from what you find in the supermarket that adjusts perfectly to your diet then this is your bread. For me it was a life saver. Thanks Julian Bakery for making this bread.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

order took 4 weeks to arrive. Doubtful product is good anymore since you are suppose to freeze or refrigerate upon arrival. Sat with a UPS tracking number for 3 weeks with no movement.  Took several emails to customer service to even get a response and all they was sorry for the delay.</review>

1. Order took over 2 months to deliver; the company was unresponsive to several emails about the status of my order. It finally arrived in February
2. Products arrived damaged (the granola was powder)
3. The cookies and brownies taste awful, my dad would not even eat them and he eats just about anything...
4.  I did not open other products of my order as I was so disappointed and wanted to return those. I contact support immediately to return immediately and no one got back to me... it is now April and I’ve finally got a hold of an employee who is refusing to refund anything..

There are so many other keto companies, DO NOT waste you time with Julian Bakery Inc.

Try instead: Kiss My Keto, Sweet Laurel, Bougie Bakes, Lakanto, Good Sam, Lily’s, Nada Moo, ect. Hoping this helps you save your money or spend it on a company with great tasting products and a working customer service department!<//review>< name>

<review>I placed an order the first week of January that came February 18. In between that, I emailed customer service 4 times asking for a refund since they couldn’t provide me with an estimated shipping time. I got only one response asking me to be patient with no additional info. I also tried calling and they have a message up saying they aren’t answering their phones. There was no indication of a delay when I placed the order, you can’t get ahold of them and they refused to give me a refund. I honestly don’t care how good the food is at this point, I’ll never order from them again because this is a dishonest way to do business. If you are that delayed stop taking more orders and at least tell people.<//review>< pics>

I received my Keto Thin bread in the mail and I seriously cannot believe how delicious it is!!!  It tastes like french toast!  It absorbs butter very nicely when it's fresh out of the toaster.  Then I put a fried egg on top and I'm in heaven. I am so grateful that I found this option!  It's better than normal bread!

I just ordered another 3 pack of Keto Thin and now I'm going to try the granola.

I saw so many bad reviews that I was nervous...but what ever it is that people were complaining about, I promise the company has corrected the problem.

I am one happy customer.< /review>

I’ve been buying from Julian for years and the customer service is getting increasing worse. I can share many horror stories.... what looked like moldy bars ( that they would not replace) to orders that take weeks to arrive with little communication. My latest debacle.... I ordered bars on Oct 1. I was charged immediately and got confirmation that a shipping label was created. No tracking ever became available. I left a message and emailed them. Absolutely NO response. I finally was able to track someone down by phone who told me that they could not locate the tracking and they would send out another order that day. That was a week ago. Nothing..... and I live very close to their headquarters. So I’m out $55 and have no bars to show for it. Shame on you Julian. You had no problem charging me but no sense of urgency to rectify your error.< /review>

I have experienced the same as many recent reviews.  Have been a customer for years and placed an order over 3 weeks ago.  Have contacted them 3 times and no response.  I have been charged for the items and it has not shipped.  I'll be contacting my  credit card company for a refund as well.  So disappointed!</text>

I would love to say their products are great,  but the place is mismanaged and shipping is more than pathetic. 27 days since order and the product has still not shipped. Not a problem with Covid at this point, it is all on them.
Forget them. Must be somewhere else that can do what they do. Any suggestions?<//text>

Do not buy from this vendor they do not own up to their mistakes.

I placed an order with Julian Bakery on January 9, 2021. My credit card was charged immediately. After weeks and not receiving tracking or shipping information, I began to reach out for status on my order.
I called the company and no one ever answers the phones. You get an answering machine with no option to leave a message. Emails were on an auto response that they were understaffed due to Covid. This is not the case as I have seen other complaints online about this company's lack of response for years (wish I knew this previously).
I finally received my order on February 16, 2021!! Honestly I had lost hope of ever getting my products and had written it off.
Julian Bakery's customer service is non-existent.  I will never place another order with this company again.
I order the 3 pack of breads (keto and 2 other paleo ones) and 12 pk of keto brownies. The only thing  I have tried thus far is the brownies. I was unimpressed. Flavor was off and not moist. Since I have not tried the breads yet, I cannot comment.
I order many keto products from various companies. I have never had this experience with ANY of the companies I order from frequently. In fact I am on auto delivery with many other companies with excellent customer service and products. Again, I will never order from this company.< /text>

I've been ordering a variety of products from Julian's Bakery for over two years now and never disappointed. Quality selection with great ingredients. Always fresh. Absolutely, love the Pro Granola. Look forward to eating breakfast every morning. Superb taste, high protein with so many quality choices.< /review>

I have been purchasing their bread for 5 years. My daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 3. Normally I purchase the coconut bread in whole foods but they stopped carrying it. I ordered 6 loaves online, $63. It took a couple weeks for them to ship it and 7 days for it to arrive. I've ordered online in the past and it didnt take that long. I've emailed 4 times once to the business email twice to customer service and once to sales . I'm pretty sure it isnt any good after 7 days of sitting out. It's frustrating they haven't responded but theyve definitely lost a customer . I will be contacting them for a refund. It is unsafe for anyone to eat old bread and I definitely wont be giving it to my child . Shame on them< /review>

My husband ordered granola on December 29th. It's been almost 2 months, and they haven't sent anything. He's contacted costumer service and keeps getting automated messages or tracking numbers that don't actually work. He's gotten his refund through PayPal , but still what awful service.</Review>

<text>If I could give Julian Bakery 0 stars I would.  Placed my order over 2 weeks ago and still no sign of when it will be delivered.   Tried to call and received a voice message they're not taking calls and to email customer service.  I emailed customer service and all I got back was to be patient and my order will be delivered soon.  I'll be contacting my credit card company to dispute this charge since I don't believe I'll ever receive my order.< /text>< response>

Follow-up #5: It's like a Disney movie - a happy ending and all. One of the original orders that hadn't been sent was refunded even though I had confirmed I still wanted the products. They apologized and said they would get the order out to me, and at no charge! Much better CS since the beginning, which is why I am now giving them a 4-star rating.

Follow-up #4: Changed to 3-star rating. 2 of the 3 orders finally arrived!! It took forever, but worth the wait since the products are good. I checked on the 3rd order. Their response a couple days later was covid-related issues. It would have been nice if 1) they had informed me of this when the order was first placed, and 2) they could give me a shipping date. Oh well.

Because of finally receiving the orders, and because I like the products and the company story, I will change my star rating to 3 stars. IF and when they change up their CS and supply chain process, I'll re-rate them again.

Follow-up #3: I was ready to change my rating back to four stars, but it seems the saga continues. Reading through the other one star reviews, I noticed that someone from JB suggested the person contact the company directly via a different email address, one that is not posted on their site. So, I decided to try this approach. Lo and behold, I FINALLY reached the right person! I briefly explained my situation, and, although at first they didn't respond to my email directly, within ten minutes I received alerts that all three orders had been processed! I also received separate alerts with tracking numbers. A total miracle!!! But I then checked the tracking and all it said was that labels were created and that my orders had been assigned tracking - nothing had been shipped. ARGH! Once again, a total letdown. Their customer service person finally responded to one of my multiple emails and said that because of COVID, employees had to stay 6' apart from one another, which is why the orders hadn't been shipped. This makes no sense. And, it's also no excuse for poor communication with customers since it's all through email. Hopefully I'll get my orders soon. I still love their products.

Follow-up #2: I have continued to contact customer service again (twice) and still no response whatsoever from anyone. No orders delivered. Nothing! I do keep receiving email promotions though, so it seems they're still in business.

Follow-up: After numerous emails asking about my cancelled order, their reply was "Thank you for your email. You will receive a new tracking number on Monday. The shipping label was created and then cancelled. We apologize for the inconvenience." NO reasoning whatsoever. NO attempt to compensate for their incompetencies. This is beyond frustrating and disappointing.

The products are great, but absolute worst customer service of any company I've ever had to deal with! I have placed three orders over the past two and a half weeks and haven't received one item. After contacting CS 6 times, someone finally responded to my email saying that orders take 7 - 10 business days. They finally processed one order but when I went to check the tracking number, the screen prompt on the Fed Ex site said the seller had cancelled the order. I contacted JB again but still never hear from anyone. What the heck? If another company comes up with products that match JB, then I'll switch. For now, I'm giving them a one star review - I will update this based on the outcome.<//review>

Julian Bakery has always been amazing and the Keto food is tremendous. Sadly, I cant say the same for the customer service. My order from December 8th 2020 has still not been fulfilled. I emailed Corporate support and they replied the next day-good news your order has been processed with a tracking number. (Why did it take me asking where my month old order was for it to be processed?) No apology. No explanation. The tracking number didn’t work so I replied back asking what happened and that the tracking number shows invalid. They said it shipped the 28th of December yet the packing slip on their letterhead shows it shipped 1/6/21 when the partial order finally arrived this week. Still no apology or attempt to make it right. Only HALF the order has arrived and again this was placed on the 8th of December. I replied back that I  don’t appreciate being lied too (saying it shipped on the 28th) and that i expected more from Julian Bakeries customer service than bring lied to, no apology and no attempt to make it right. Mind you, all of my orders are sizable and not just 1 or 2 items. You try to call and it says they won’t be returning calls due to being short staffed and to email. I ordered another large order 2 weeks ago because i thought it would arrive within a normal time frame and there is no tracking data for that order available yet either. That is unacceptable. I dont understand what is going on with your customer service, but it’s incredibly disappointing. I have been a loyal customer for years and recommended you to countless friends and family members. Having a reputation of treating customers in this way isn’t how I imagine you want your brand recognized. I would like to share all details of my email exchanges for you to see the way you’re “customer service” team is treating your customers.</text>

Suddendly they answer to make contact at business@ .....why dont they do that through email when contacted or over the phone? to consume bad eggs is very dangerous and to tell me to freeze it, it will be ok is outrageous....I ordered the bread, supposed to arrive in 1 to 3 days. It took 7 days to the bread to arrive. Because I live in Florida it probably was too hot for too long and the packages were all blown up -sign of fermentation. Remember this bread is made with eggs!! I thought that to call customer service will resolve the problem. Big mistake a condescending woman advised me to just freeze the bread and ' it will be ok". When I told her that the bread traveled 7 days before final destination and was all fermented obviously, she asked me to show her the picture of the bread itself, looking for mold traces...anyway I threw away the 40 dollars order. My friend who ordered the keto cookies, received them in 3 days, gave me 1 to taste,  asking what I thought. The Keto cookies taste is absolutely horrible too,  bitter with a chemical taste and mostly. Whats wrong with this company???? I do not recommend it at all. A mistake can happen to everyone but this?!  I put 1 star because 0 doesnt exist!<//Review>< pictures>

I ordered the protein bars over a year ago after reading the excellent reviews at the web site.  (In retrospect, the company deleted all of the negative reviews.)  The product that arrived was inedible.  I contacted the company and was told I could get a refund if I shipped back the uneaten product at my own expense.  Customer Service clearly had heard so many complaints they did not care any more.  They were almost insulting in their responses. Since then I found a Facebook group, "Got scammed by Julian Bakery," which indicates the displeasure of so many customers.  (It takes a lot of dislike for someone to create a Facebook group.)  I am surprised this company is still in business, considering their nasty product and terrible customer service.  Buyer beware!<//review>< date>

The only product I’ve tried is the granola, and it is absolutely amazing. I can’t stop buying it. All 7 flavors cure the sweet tooth; the most amazing part is that it is high protein and low sugar which I spent the longest time trying to find throughout other companies. This granola is something I could see myself purchasing for the rest of my life as it makes a perfect breakfast or high protein snack.

My only suggestion is I wish they offered more variety pack options (they currently have 1 3-pack). Variety packs make it easier to buy in bulk and it saves a little money at the same time. Given that the price of each individual granola is not cheap, I hope they consider throwing in some more variety packs with different flavors!< /Review>

<review>Update: My bread finally came and I was very excited to try it. I tried it as avocado toast and made a grilled cheese. I think it’s a matter of taste. It has a very strong flavor that over powers and I didn’t particularly like it...tastes almost like a pound cake. Also, It’s  quite pricey and you have to buy a minimum of 3 loaves so you’re stuck if you don’t like it.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1590334256767, 'text': 'Tammy,\nYour confirmation was emailed to you but they can get filtered sometimes into your spam folder.

<Time>1605235382486</Time><rate>4<//rate><review>I see a lot of negative reviews here for Julian Bakery. I cannot speak for most of their products since I only just get one: their granola.

I absolutely love their granola. It features high quality, organic ingredients, and is a source of both pre-biotics and pro-biotics! No weird oils, fillers, or any other nonsense.

Plus, the granola is high protein, high fiber, and low calorie with ONLY clean ingredients. What's not to like? I personally use it as a Greek Yogurt topper alongside fruit and honey. It is both delicious and nutritious.

While the price is pretty high for the granola, I think it is worth every dollar for the quality they put into their product.

I do hope this company can resolve whatever issues people are having because it would be unfortunate for poor customer service or bad weather to ruin the reputation of a company that puts out a solid product. Like I said though, I can only speak on the granola.

This entire rating applies to the granola only. I've never tried any other Julian Bakery product besides the granolas.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>We placed out first order with Julian Bakery and that will be our last order.

We were shipped smashed bread. I understand things happen, so when I reached out to their customer support, the said "the bread has not been affected", trasnlation: oh well we are not gonna do anything about it.

Now if the bread was $2 a loaf it would be no big deal. But their bread is over $13 per loaf.

I will never order from them again for treating customers (me) so poorly.

If you don't mind paying $13 for some smashed bread, then by all means, but I will never order again.<//Text><userid>100654710740355146602<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I ordered their “fresh” 3 loaf very expensive bread. They took awhile to receive. My husband and I tried all 3 loaves. They tasted horrible. I emailed them and they basically said no returns, no refunds. I don’t know what’s wrong with the bread but it’s not palatable. I’ve been eating low carb foods for awhile and this just doesn’t cut it. I was not impressed with the customer service response either. I give 2 stars instead of 1  because their granola is very good.< /Text>< Rate>

Ordered 12/25 and now it's 1/14.  No tracking and attempts to get a reply from this company have failed.  I've spent more than $1000 with this company but will avoid them in the future because they have messed up and jerked me around one too many times.  Shame shame shame!< /Text>

I would give it a Zero star if I could.  Taste is horrible.  Smells like cake and has no taste.
Wish I would have seen all of these reviews before ordering 6 loaves.  Somehow all I saw was hundreds of reviews and all were 5 star.  I was definitely influenced by the reviews and decided to go for the it.  $100 mistake.  Tried a grilled cheese as last chance and ate 2 bites.

So I want to update my post......I gave the Keto Breads a one star but the company has responded to my disappointment in over the top fashion........Julian Bakery.........you’ve earned a 5 Star rating......... totally unexpected........Treating you’re customers right will go a long way.

So I am averaging my star rating ...... bumped up for over the top customer service!

A sincere thank you and 👍🏻</text>

<review>Ordered 3 loaves of paleo bread, based mostly on all the positive reviews.   The bread is terrible, it’s wet and spongy and you can’t even toast it.   I tried to post my review on their website but it’s not showing, and they don’t allow negative reviews on Facebook, it seems they only allow positive reviews.<//review>< pictures>

<Rating>2< /Rating><review>I’ve always ordered my Paleo protein from here and referred many to do the same. The product is great - natural ingredients and the flavor is amazing not like chalky protein I’ve tried in the past. For a product I give 5 stars but as a company bc of customer service I give it 2 stars. It takes forever to receive your order and if you’re like me and use protein daily this is a major inconvenience. I called regarding my order to see if we could expedite because I’m desperately out — the female who answered was rude and short. Being a long loyal customer I find this unacceptable. Still waiting for my protein... luckily I found another clean brand in HEB that I’m quite happy with.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I ordered the bread 3 pack. I tried each kind, all heavily toasted, and found them really unpleasant in taste and texture. I threw them out. The chocolate granola was edible but has an odd fake taste of weird sweetener. Its ok in yogurt but not so much on its own. Expensive products.<//text>

Julian Bakery is mostly an on-line seller of keto/paleo food products.  On an application such as Google Maps, the only “rating” should be a visit to this particular location AND NOT JUST ITS MAIL ORDER PRODUCTS.  Example:  The Tillamook Cheese factory in Tillamook, Oregon is a tourist attraction with a factory tour and lots of cheese shopping.  When you go to Tillamook, you are rating the visit and not merely its cheese.  That is, Tillamook could have great cheese but it’s a lousy tourist visit, or vice-versa (I liked both aspects, for the record).  In the case of Julian Bakery, I can’t tell if anyone has actually visited this location...if there’s a tour with product samples, etc.  If you want to rate its products you buy from Amazon, then USE AMAZON TO RATE ITS PRODUCTS.  On a Map App, the rating should be based on a location / visitation experience (as in visiting the Factory in Oceanside)....otherwise Google should suppress ratings merely related to its products on the Google Map App.</Text>

DO NOT order anything from this company!  This was an expensive mistake!  I ordered the bread, granola and crackers. All were absolutely terrible!  The bread is strangely sweet and tastes like cake. The granola has the texture of sawdust with a REALLY bad after taste. The crackers are inedible. I emailed the company to return all of the items that I ordered and they said they would refund only non perishables that had not been opened. The bread is considered perishable so that went in the trash along with the bag of granola that I opened and the crackers.<//review>

<Review>After seeing pics of people receiving moldy bread, I was really nervous about this purchase. Especially cuz I live in a humid climate.
The bread was perfect! I followed the packaging instructions, and have used it for toast and a grilled ham & cheese sandwich.
It smells sweet, like pound cake. And there is kind of a hint of sweetness to it. Does it taste totally like bread? No. But it is the best low carb bread I’ve tried. And I’ve had 4 slices today, and only 4g of carbs!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dc71b8970d464d:0xd3469738c74cf5a7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This company has AWFUL customer service!  I ordered 3 loaves of the bread  - not really that edible- so I threw them away.  I should have learned my lesson, but their ads kept coming up on my FB feed, so I tried two boxes of the low carb protein bars - they arrived to the house in a flimsy envelope that had ripped open and one of the boxes was totally empty.  When I contacted them - they indicated it was not their responsibility that I would have to contact MY delivery service!!! I didn't pick FEDEX THEY DID!  AND they chose to stuff two heavy boxes in a flimsy envelope.  So I'm out $29.99 for a box of gross tasting protein bars!  AMAZON Would have sent a new box without question. Don't buy from these people!!!<//review>

<Review>Dont order from this company, absolute worst customer service

Lies about shipping to not issue a refund, laughs on phone, twists words to not issue a refund for an item they havent even produced yet

This is why documenting everything is amazing, please wait for the viral youtube video of how bad customer support can get featuring julian bakery< /Review>< Resp>

I was excited to try Julian's Bakery and I spent $210 on my first order.  This was a $210 mistake.  Everything tasted terrible.  I ordered 3 loaves of bread, brownies, cookies, protein bars, granola (3 flavors) and Monk fruit.  The only thing usable is the Monk fruit sweetener.  The bread tastes like chalk.  The taste in the brownies and cookies is awful.  The granola is okay, except for the after taste.  I ordered two of the chocolate granola by mistake and I thought it would be okay because the reviews on the website were so great.  I just want to warn others that the taste of their food is terrible.  A huge, expensive disappointment.<//Text>

Leaving a review here since they delete any negative comments and ban you rom their Facebook ads god forbid you leave a real response to someone’s questions and anyone who leaves a negative comment/review.

Their bread is absolutely disgusting. The slices are goofy small, the texture is like a dense wet sponge that falls apart and if you manage to bite it, it’s awkwardly chewy. It has an odd, weird, unpleasant odor. The taste is absolutely horrible, the scent might even be worse. They’re dense, wet, and just absolutely horrible.</review>

Do not buy from this company. I received the bread and it was all bad and I spent $80.00!! I emailed the company several times and no response. They reply with hey send us an email at business@julianbakery.com and still nothing... no response! Way to take advantage of people who are trying to make life style changes.<//review>

Got my order in a timely fashion but the paleo coconut  bread has zero taste,  a weird moist texture,  doesn't toast. I would have gotten the almond keto bread which might have been better tasting but at 140 calories a slice it's too much<//text>

If I could give negative stars I would. ABSOLUTELY horrible product AND ABSOLUTELY horrible customer service. I am not one to put a negative review, however DO NOT ORDER THIS JUNK. The "bread" arrived with mold all over it and it was all sticky and slimy. It was DISGUSTING to look at and the smell was even worse! I notified the bakery and they said to send a photo. I sent them a photo of the moldy slimy bread and then they said, send us a picture of the barcode. I sent them the picture of the barcode and then they said they need a picture of some number on the bread that doesn't actually exist. I finally had enough of their games. No problem. Chargeback with credit card company and blasting them all over the internet for their disgusting product and service.</review>

<name>Kimberly Johnson< /name><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Please do not buy the Keto bread thinking it will have a flavor or texture anywhere near bread. It was more like a chewy egg. In addition, the 2-day shipping turned in to more than 10 days. It wasn’t until I reached out the Julian Bakery via FB messenger that they stated they were making the bread “that” day and would be shipped to me shortly. I don’t normally leave negative reviews but I ordered based on ALL the positive reviews on their FB ads. Lesson learned.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
I ordered three loaves of keto bread. The bread I received if a funky color and looks, smells, and tastes moldy. I reached out to the company via Facebook messenger about it tasting moldy. They blocked me from being able to send messages or comment on their page. Then I emailed customer service and they lied and said they don’t block people on Facebook. There’s a page on Facebook called Julian Bakery scam where hundreds of other people received moldy, disgusting bread and got blocked from their Facebook page. Do NOT order from this company. It’s absolutely disgusting products and even worse customer service. This place is getting reported to the better business bureau and I’ll let Facebook know too. This place needs to be shut down.<//Review>

< Review>
Ordered three loaves of Paleo thin sandwich bread for $34. Followed their advice, immediately put it in the freezer and toasted it the next morning. Tried toasting it on high like they recommended. The center remains doughy and soggy and the crust is burnt. Try eating it without toasting it? No way! It’s texture and taste are not appealing. I sent them an email asking for a refund and they refused. Due to all the complaints I have read on Google I do not understand why they even sell this product. Tried reviewing the product on their website and it’s nowhere to be found.
I usually don’t give bad reviews. But, when they refuse to let me return their product for a refund I feel people should know.<//Review>

<text>I honestly don't know why people are complaining. Yes it took a little longer to deliver my product. The bread tasted well. It has no preservatives what do you expect the bread to taste like. It's supposed to be healthy. I've noticed the people around the keto community and friendly diets. Are always complaining when the results don't work and blame it on the product. I've been ordering for me and my wife over the last 3 years. People that think the bread tastes bad. Should just buy regular bread. And stop trying to waste their time and your time to. It's really healthy the way they make it. Make sure you put it on the freezer as soon as you get it. The delivery process took a little longer than expected. But you sure you expect this from a really really healthy place. Everything is made so fresh has nothing to preserve it that's why it takes a little longer to get deliver. You can try listening to all these one and two stars. That just complain about how bad the bread tastes like and the delivery process. But from my perspective these are the best breads I've ever had. Thank you Julian Bakery I'll always be ordering my product from you guys.< /text><Time>1558748935749< /Time><GmapID>0x80dc71b8970d464d:0xd3469738c74cf5a7</GmapID>< user_id>

<review>This bread is heavy and dense and not at all as advertised. I literally threw it away after trying half of one slice. I gave a loaf to a friend and he threw it away as well!! Some may like this, if you like pound cake like bread that has the consistency of cornmeal. After posting a review on Instagram (where I discovered them and they advertise constantly) the company blocked me.

Company will not make this right even after being told to contact them.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Good products. Poor communication and extremely slow shipping with few to no emailed status updates. I placed my order on May 6. It is now May 18 with no status and no product. Your products are good...but it seems like you need some help getting the customer service side to work better.

Note: I am downgrading because their customer service and communications issues have not improved since my last order. I placed another order over 2 weeks ago, giving them another chance to get it together. Same old story as before. Will update with any resolution (if there is any).

Update: I finally did receive my order, although with no responses from customer service when I asked for updates. Their products are good, but they really do seem to have production and customer service "challenges", which definitely need to be addressed IMO.< /text>

Keto thin bread is not good. I guess if your desperate it can be more of a sweet bread. Tried it out as a grilled cheese and I threw it out - yuck! Those people who gave this bread good reviews either have a vested interest in the company or haven’t had bread in years and forgot what it should taste like. Way too $ for what you get. #buyersregret<//text>

Waiting a long time for the Moldy bread to arrive, which is why it probably had mold. When I was putting it right into the freezer I noticed the mold on top of the bread. Yuk.Especially for $30 Tried to call within 24 hours but they don't answer so I sent multiple emails. This is the service you should expect from Julian Bakery.

<text>The bread was so gross and I'm not a picky eater. The smell was nauseating. The texture and taste were even worse. Their website says to reach out on Facebook messenger so I did. After days of sending messages someone finally responded and said to email them. I emailed and they said to respond on messenger! Maddening. I get an additional message after all of that on messenger asking me "gee, what's the problem how can we help?" had they bothered to read my handful of messages they would have known what the problem was. It's all just a tactic so that eventually you get frustrated and stop requesting your refund. Terrible customer service. Awful tasting products. Save your money.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Save your money. The Keto bread is disgusting. Upset that I wasted $40 on this garbage but it’s my own fault. I only read Facebook reviews and somehow those remain favorable despite the company having horrendous reviews on every other major platform (I failed to check prior to ordering). Maybe they delete the bad reviews on Facebook?  Anyway, their customer service is nonexistent also and you will not receive a refund if you don’t like the product. The only option is to buy three loaves at $39.99 instead of having the option to try one loaf at a lower price. I think they do this on purpose because they know they are not likely to get repeat orders. I also found they were involved in lawsuits related to their ingredient claims and that independent evaluators were finding higher calorie and carb contents than what they report. If I would have been more diligent about checking them out, I never would have purchased. Lesson learned.</review>

<Review>I absolutely LOVE this company. The chocolate brownie and cookie dough protein bars are amazing. They're a little chewy, but they are delicious, have no sugar and have no processing junk ingredients, chemicals, etc. I'm surprised/sad to see so many low reviews here. I've been ordering their products for almost a year now. I have a very low sugar tolerance and also need a lot of protein/fiber and there is no company out there supplying products with quality, nutritious ingredients. I also noticed they've changed their shipping practice and so you'll get your order MUCH quicker now - I ordered on Thursday and my delivery is scheduled for today, Saturday. One other note- they use monk fruit to sweeten the products, it's a distinct flavor but it certainly doesn't taste fake. I love that they use fruit instead of something artificial or toxic to the body. Give Julian Bakery a try!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Horrible!  I waited 3 weeks for black chocolate chip cookies that look nothing like they are advertised.  They smell so horrid I couldn’t even try them.  My review was quickly deleted by them from their fb page And they don’t allow you to post photos to prove what a scam they are.  No wonder their fb page has such high stars!  Save your money!<//text>

<Text>I ordered the variety pack of bread. The seed medley tastes funky and the almond bread is dry and doesn’t taste much better. I see on their website and social media they only post positive reviews and comments. That’s very dishonest in my opinion. Definitely not worth the expensive price tag.

<rating>2< /rating><Text>The bread is disgusting. The pizza crust fell apart completely and wouldn't stay together so I had to throw it out, essentially throwing out over $100 because you can only order certain items in bulk. I think the biggest issue with this company as reflected in many of the reviews is that the company isn't even trying to build a happy customer base. You would think they would allow money back or at the very least store credit, something to try to build goodwill with customers seeking to support new small businesses who want to buy wheat and grain free foods. I actually do like their Paleo Thins but again, they've demonstrated such terrible customer service and lack of interest in even pretending to want to make customers repeat I'm not interested in supporting them with my business, even for the few items on the website I actually liked.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1566440313883, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear of these issues.

I am a senior lady and trying to eat more healthy. I ordered crackers, bread and protein bars with the idea to help with snacking and having something to grab and go.  I have tried 1 of each item and can not even think of eating more.  The tastes are so overwhelmingly strong and leave a bad after taste.  I feel like I wasted $100 of my limited funds.😝😟.  I will not be ordering more and would not recommend ordering from any company without tasting a sample first.  I’m not sure who wrote all the 5 star reviews on their site!!!  Got taken by them😟<//Review>

I live in the U.K., I would have given them a 4/5 review were it not for the amount I had to pay for the SHIPPING FEE.

I order the Keto Thin Tortilla Wraps which already cost around $10 only for them
to slap on a $38.00 shipping fee which adds up to $48.00 for a packet of 7 TORTILLAS!

Absolute Disgrace, DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY<//Review>

< review>
A friend shared a few slices of the Keto bread with me.  It was good, so I spent $35.00 abs ordered 3 loaves (the minimum you can buy).  The bread was delived via Fed Ex.  I opened the box and went to prep the bread for the freezer, as recommended, and noticed the bread had mold spots.  I went onto the site and called the customer service number and got no answer.  I then emailed them on Monday and sent a picture.  They told me Sorry you didn't call us within 24 hours there is nothing we can do about it.  I warned others on Facebook about what happened and they blocked me.  I can guarantee they will take this post down too if they can find a way.  Buyer beware of this place.  There are actual Facebook groups about people ranting about this place.  I just wish I had seen them before I placed my order.</review>

I came across Primal Peanut Butter ProGranola (with grass fed whey protein) they advertise on their website and decided to give it a try.  It was awful!!  Not editable at all.  It leaves a horrible after taste.   I thought when I reached out to Julian Bakery they would try to remedy the purchase in some sort of way but I was wrong.  Their customer service basically said I was out the money and to read their policy.  As someone who spent hard earn money here that was a big disappointment.  Apparently, I should spend my money elsewhere.

P.S. In my opinion, the Primal products taste disgusting!< /Text>

Don’t waste your $30.  This Keto thin bread is awful. I cannot eat this stuff. They offer no money back guarantee or returns. If they let you try one loaf at a time would have been better but you have to buy three. $10 a loaf. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  Nasty.</Review>

<Review>I rarely post reviews, but in this case I feel the need to. I placed my order 6/10/19, and received it 6/28/19. That’s the longest I’ve ever had to wait for anything to arrive. Although that was a bit of a stretch; I was happy I finally received it. When I opened the package I was disappointed to see that it wasn’t packaged very well and it wasn’t the correct order. They had labels on the bread stating to refrigerate as soon as possible after purchase, but didn’t take the time to try and preserve it while on its way to me. Nevertheless; I placed the bread in the fridge and decided to taste it the next day.
It was TERRIBLE. Now, I’m a fan of almond flour and coconut flour, and understand things may taste different as I’m use to these types of ingredients. However, the bread just tasted bitter, and sour. It had a nasty smell (related to the smell of bad milk). The slices were very heavy, and not airy at all. I am disappointed and unfortunately will not be a customer ever in the future. My advice and opinion is if you want paleo bread; try and buy within your local area, or make it. That’s what I normally do, but wanted to give this a try because it was mentioned in a book I was reading.< /Review>< userid>

Sadly, I echo several here that the taste is awful. and you can"t toast it.  my response was that "we don't do returns for taste".  Really?  i would hope for a better response or an offer to trade for something else like crackers?  Waiting for owner response.< /review>

I just bought my first loaf at my local store. The almond bread is delicious. I toasted the bread on a skillet on each side (I hate electric toasters) and it came out perfectly that way. I made avocado toast for dinner with it. It was very filling and satisfying, which doesn't happen with bread made from wheat flour. I'm glad I found this bread because it's the only thing I keep failing at on the Paleo diet...I needed a bread replacement so I can stay on track. I don't think I would order online because I can buy it locally.<//text>

The 3 loaves of keto bread arrived and each piece of bread was Wet and soggy. Unusable and unacceptable. Of course no refund and of course I will never order form them again.<//Review>

< Review>
Shipping is excrutiangly slow. It took almost 3 weeks for my order to arrive from the day I placed the order. There were zero ice packs in the box so I understand now why a lot of customers receive moldy bread. My bread was not moldy so I cannot complain about that. The bread smells and tastes strongly like eggs. It has a decent consistency. I will NOT buy again since I don't really think it is worth it, but I will definitely eat my 3 loaves.<//Review>

<Review>I ordered the bread, chocolate chip peanut putter cookies and some protein bars. The bread so so disgusting and crumbly, I took out a slice to toast and it fell apart. The cookies are chewy and have a good peanut butter taste but the chocolate tasted rotten. And the protein bars all taste the same and have the same texture. I couldn’t even eat one bite. I wanted to send them back but they refused! Don’t buy from them. Horrible food and terrible customer service.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1567264779699, 'text': 'It appears your order may have been delayed in transit causing the spoilage.

<text>I really do not want to give one star either.
I placed order on 5/3.  I received their shipping tracking information created 5/6.  And I received a box with three loaf of bread on 5/20. They are all had mildewed.  They told me that it will send replacement the same day, and they sent me a tracking information, however, it was not shipped yet.  Per their explanation that they are making breads now, so as soon as it has baked, they will send.
At this point, I have no interest.  No, I am really scared to eat their bread. Their customer skill who is handling perishable items and foods, is so unprofessional. I am wonder how they can keep a good standing and pass health department inspection.
I will report to the appropriate government organization.  After I paid $29.99 + tax, shipping, they are refusing to perform what they promised to do, and they have NOT done anything to correct this situation.  I believe this company is just riding the Hip culture, Keto, Gluten Free, Paleo what ever, and they really do not care about who is really have a condition cannot consume Gluten products.

I ordered bread on January 31, 2019. I was sent an email stating I would receive the product in 3 business days. It has been 9 business days and though UPS has a tracking number the product has not been received at the Post Office. I don't know how long you'd wait for a delivery, but it is too long for me.<//Text>

I’m learning of all of these issues now as I’ve been wondering where my order is and contact customer service. $30 is ALOT of money for bread to just throw away. Don’t waste your money here they obviously have no idea how to run a business properly. Now we will see how it will take for me to get me refund....so frustrating!<//text>

Customer service was horrible. Contacted them and was happy that I had a human to talk to but I typed my question and they directed me to an e-mail address. So no real customer service. I got an email on Thursday to tell me it would go out Monday or Tuesday. Failed to mention that they meant any Monday or Tuesday they felt like shipping it on. Honesty is important. My message to cancel my order went ignored. It was not because it had shipped as that didn't happen for days after. I got it today and it is soggy. I thought if I refrigerated it and toasted it that would be ok. It could not taste worse. The loaves are tiny. I have bought keto bread for a long time from thin slim foods. I understand it does not taste like store bread. Thought trying another bread would be a good idea. A little variety right. I still believe variety is good but I will never buy from this company again. You better believe google reviews is not my last review for this company. When you charge a premium for a product you better care more about your customers and quality. I promise at least 60 days of reviews. That should cover most of the more popular sites. This company in my opinion should not be in business.</text>

<Review>Placed my over on November 12 and got the bread today, November 20. The bread is disgusting! I got the variety trio. The Paleo bread with seeds was moldy and soggy. The paleo sandwich bread was even more soggy and yukky PURPLE in color. The keto thin bread is soggy and whitish yellow, but tasteless. I got the nonperishables first! The granola was OK and the crackers were pretty good. I will not be dealing with this company again, they charge a fortune for the bread and it was really just AWFUL. Julian bakery is bound to go out of business soon, I wish I would have read the Google reviews first!< /Review><date>1574287285195<//date>< rating>

This company will block you if you leave a baf Facebook review!  I feel like the world needs to know that YOU are trying to poison us!
You robbed me of $30 and potentially my health!  Reporting to the CDC and BBB!

<Review>I bought the coconut bread. So excited, toasted it and made a beautiful veggie sandwich. I got terrible heart burn into the second bite (not normal for me) took some ACV, but still had to throw the sandwich away. The smell is strongly of eggs which was a huge mental turn off for me as well. So glad I only bought one loaf. $9 out the window.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

They shipped three loads of bread I was working a 5 day stretch in the ER. Bread was frozen as requested on day 1. Bread taken out of freezer and is a soggy mess. Called them back and they refuse to reissue edible bread or refund money. This company sales garbage! Be ware and order local!! #Nastassbread<//review>

<Review>Bought their bread for my wife.  It's terrible.  And they know it's terrible.  Their website says they don't take returns for taste issues.  Wish I had read that before making the purchase.  If you sell a product online, you should take it back if someone is not satisfied.  They were very responsive on Facebook messenger when I asked a question before I bought it, silent when I reached out after we received it and said how unhappy we were with their product.  So, just to be clear, the bread is not good at all.  Don't buy it, you'll just be wasting your money.</Review>< Gmap_id>

The granola cereal was disgusting.  Especially the peanut butter.  It had a bad taste and an even worse aftertaste.  Very unnatural imitation flavor that lingered in my mouth.  When I asked for a refund of some sort, I was told "No" since it was open.   Not sure how I was supposed to taste the product if I didn't open.<//Text>

I understand and appreciate what these folks are trying to do. The complaints seem to be from people unfamiliar with what Paleo or Keto actually means. The bread came fresh as can be and of course, it will not be like wonderbread. Cheers to an awesome product.</review>

I don't understand the poor ratings here.
I will agree that shipping is slow but I found that their customer service was more than helpful.
I ordered the variety 3 pack that contained the almond, seed medley and coconut bread.  All three are very good and are solid alternatives to traditional bread if you have gluten issues or are trying to reduce your grain/carb and/or calorie intake.  I especially like the seed medley toasted with avocado or as a sandwich.
You must freeze these products immediately and keep them in the freezer until ready to use because they contain no preservatives.
If you are looking for something exactly like bread, you might be disappointed but this is the best no grain bread I have ever eaten and I will continue to order from Julian Bakery.<//review>

<review>I purchased 3 loaves of kept bread for $10 each. When they arrived, they were warm and gooey in the middle and had a putrid smell. I tasted a piece anyway, and it was the worst tasting thing! Really just gross. I wrote to customer service about a refund and they refused to back their product. To expensive to try. Take my word, DON'T buy this stuff online.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I saw them on Facebook. Typically I do Google search but I did not. I placed my order on 2/25/19. Like everyone else, got an email stating my order would be shipped with in 3 business days. Tracking kept saying waiting in the items to be received. I'LL SAY THIS, I POSTED A COMMENT ABOUT MY PRODUCTS I ORDERED, WHERE WERE THEY, ON ONE OF THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS ONLY TO GO BACK TO IT THE NEXT DAY TO SEE NOT ONLY WAS MY COMMENT DELETED BUT THEY BLOCKED ME FROM COMMENTING PERIOD! I sent them an email several days via their website only to get a "generated email" stating that my items will be shipped end of week. They've been "backlogged". Well only thing anyone can do, DISPUTE THE CHARGES WITH YOUR BANK! I DID BECAUSE IM NOT TAKING A LOSS. NOT ONLY THAT, THEY ARE UNDER FIRE FOR LYING ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS. I HOPE THEY GET SHUT DOWN. AND GUESS WHAT JULIAN BAKERY..... YOU CAN'T DELETE A GOOGLE REVIEW OR BLOCK IT. PEOPLE, CONTACT YOUR BANKS!<//text>

ONLY complaint... it's really a bummer how long it takes to receive the bars, however I still feel they are worth the wait. Many people on here are stating that the company never ships the product... and I would like to say THIS IS NOT CORRECT. Yes, shipping takes longer than you may expect, but I have now ordered bars twice and received them. This is a legitimate business!

Hopefully, as the business grows the process will become more efficient.. but like I said, these are by far my favorite and most diet-friendly protein bars!<//Text>< Name>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>I'll give it 2 stars because the delivery and purchase process was fast and easy. However, the products were distasteful. I got the  Insta Ketoes Orange Burst Protein Bars $ 30 and the Keto Bread $11 each comes on 3 pack. I spent $70 on this order it was delivered a day later to my surprise since it said 3 business days. So I was very happy with the fast delivery process, unfortunately, the bars (which I chose due to very high reviews) taste like rotten food. The bars are so hard to bit, chewy and Plasticine like product. The bread had a good taste on the first bite then as I kept eating it the taste turned into spoiled bread. The bread went bad a day after I opened the bag.  Overall, the product are very poor quality and I do not recommend my friends, family or anyone to buy anything from here. SIDE NOTE: There is no refund policy on perishables open items*< /Review><rate>2< /rate>< Time>

<Review>I had very low expectations and was still disappointed. The granola has a horrible aftertaste rendering it inedible. The bread is barely edible if you toast it multiple times but the smell and texture is awful. Save your money. Julian Bakery also removes any negative reviews on their Facebook page and Facebook ads creating a completely dishonest representation of their products.<//Review>< rating>

Two weeks and still no bread. I get barely polite responses, but I don't get the $10 loaves of bread I paid for. This is horrible customer service and from the other reviews on the internet about long waits, this is a long-standing problem. Frankly, I don't care if the bread tastes like fresh sourdough bought straight out of the oven on Fisherman's Wharf, I will never order from these folks again.< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I agree on the bread. I ordered The 3 count of the seed bread. You cannot toast it, I tried Putting it in the toaster 3 times in a row and the bread was still damp. This was bread that just arrived so it was not frozen and then I later Thawed. It crumbles and falls apart the minute you go to spread butter on it. Also, when frozen and then thawed, you go to pull apart the slices and they break into pieces.  Very disappointing to say the least. I threw out all 3 loaves after trying numerous different ways of trying to prepare it.  The taste is not good either, has a stale like taste to it.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

Not sure why all the poor reviews.  I had a very good experience with this seller.  The loaves of bread were obviously freshly baked and arrived as promised 2 days after they were baked (about a week after I placed the order), and the protein bars arrived 2 days after the order was placed. The protein bars are delicious.  The bread takes a little getting used to, but they are nutritionally perfect for people who want to limit their carb intake.    I find that toasting the bread really improves the texture and flavor!<//Text>

I see the real reviews come out on google. Very slow shipping. The box arrives and tells you to freeze immediately... well, with all the mold on the bread already... I really dont care to... no customer service via facebook, no messaging. When I share my experience to warn others on their ad... they delete my comment and block me from writing further comments.  Shady business... how about touching base for a refund and I might consider removing the review.</Text>

<text>I order the Paleo thin variety 3 loaf pack on Jan 22.  I had still not received my order by the due date Jan 30, 2019.  I was concerned that the gluten free bread would’ve become moldy by then.  I called many times during office hrs and no one ever answered or returned my messages!  I sent an email to customer service and received a VERY rude email from the customer rep Micah a day later stating that my parcel was delivered and that I “should walk to the front of my house to retrieve my parcel.”  And says ... “since you choose not to go outside to look for your parcel ...”. therefore it’s my fault!  Of course I looked everywhere possible!!  She/he then stated that “you will not be refunded or receive an exchange of your order.  We are not a delivery service.”  I was flabbergasted!!  I’ve ordered from many companies before and have received excellent  service and this is the first time I have ever received such disgusting rude
customer service!!  I’m not fond of writing reviews but this one I had to.  Just be warned when dealing with this company!  Unfortunately I only read about their bad past history recently ...so lesson learned.
To update I have still NOT received my parcel to this day 2/15/19.  I have opened a case file with USPS and have put in a dispute with my bank!  You would think they’d know to put the right address on and to check before mailing the parcel off!  They have all the customers’ details but obviously their customer service is of no use anyway!  I will continue to spread and put bad reviews for this place to make sure people know what a scam they are!  They took my money right away but instead of keeping customers they make enemies and lose customers!  Dumb strategy to me!!<//text>< Response>

Got my 3 loaves last week. Put them in the freezer right away, as indicated on the packaging. Unfortunately, the bread must have been very WET because you can't take 1 or 2 slices out of the freezer at a time. I wish I had known that and would have packaged it a little more freezer friendly. Usually I freeze all my bread and the slices separate easy enough. I had to defrost the entire loaf to get two slices of bread. ONTO TASTE - perhaps I was really expecting more based on the comments here or maybe I haven't been off carbs long enough to forget what real bread tastes like - however - I didn't like it at all. The bread has a "bitter" taste and not at all pleasant. The slices fall apart very easily and found it difficult to toast in the toaster and needed to use my toaster over or toast in a pan with butter. Has the consistency of cake but not sweet and just strange. Tried it a few different ways - toast with butter; toast with cinnamon and stevia; grilled cheese. All just awful. Sorry - I really hoped for good bread and this was a huge two thumbs down. I wish I had not invested the $$$ in something without a taste test. I also purchased the Keto noodle pack and tried the "rice". That had a really strange consistency and no taste at all. the parmesan cheese I mixed in to give it more flavor would not stick to the rice and just clumped up into little chewy balls.  Please note that this company is very deceptive regarding their advertising  on Facebook. I Purchased the bread  based on comments in Facebook however when I put my negative comments there, they were deleted by the company and then I was blocked from further comment. I Purchased the  bread  thinking they had overwhelmingly positive Reviews.   Very deceptive and pushing fraud in my opinion. I contacted them regarding my concerns and requested a refund and they refused.    Pursuing this matter elsewhere based on their unethical  business practice.</text>

The almond flour paleo bread is very good. Unfortunately, the delivery time is extremely slow.  It takes them a week just to ship it out  then you have to wait for a few more days on top of that for ground delivery transit time. By the time the bread is delivered, it’s on the verge of spoiling so you have to freeze it ASAP.<//Text>

<text>Do NOT buy the Keto bread. It has the worst customer service EVER! The bread was delivered in 95 degree weather, with no dry ice or anything else to protect the bread. It was just dropped at my front door on FRIDAY evening at 5:46 pm. (After the business closed) I was excited about receiving the bread in anticipation of enjoying low Keto bread. However, I was quickly disappointed. The bread was SOGGY, MOLDY SMELLING and SLIMY. GROSS.  I put it in the freezer right away hoping the next day it would be edible. NOT! I contacted the company during open business hours the past couple days but they refuse to even exchange the bread with anything. They say that the bread should have been fine for 2-3 days during shipment, but it wasn’t. Plus, they don’t take into consideration that they were closed when I received the bread. The business closes at 4:00 pm so they were already closed by the time I received the package. Plus, they are closed on weekends.so there was not anything I could do until it was opened. This bread was over $30.00 and they make you purchase the 3 mini loaves. I just want everyone to know so you wont make the same mistake as me. I will never purchase from this company again. They also delete any negative comments on FB so everyone thinks the bread is great! Maybe it would be if it wasn’t in a hot truck for two days and would have been appropriately packaged in dry ice.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>Ordered on the 12th of Feb and my order was never shipped. I contacted them on the 19th and they said it would ship by the end of the week. They stated due to back orders that is why it didn't ship. I was promised that it would be shipped by Friday and today is Friday. USPS was still awaiting Julian Bakery to send the item to them to ship. I contacted customer support and stated if it was not going to ship today to refund my money. So I am assuming they couldn't get the order out today and choose to refund my money. Just stating "sorry for the inconvenience" is not good customer service. Good customer service is following through with your promise. I totally get your were backlogged but my order should have been expedited after I inquired the first time. You missed not one shipping promise but two. That is why this is a one star review.<//Text>< user>

I felt strongly to write about my experience.   About three months ago I ordered the bread and I had unexpected travel so I wrote to the company asking to refund my order and they gave me my money back immediately as it had not shipped. I was excited to try again and was a bit bummed reading all these reviews.   Clearly, Julian Bakery has worked really hard to improve their distribution which seemed to be the cause of the issues of a lot of their poor reviews (mold etc).   I received my keto bread 2 days via FedEx after it shipped.   Now if you are not accustomed to keto or you have never made your own true keto bread, you maybe caught off guard as it is not like traditional bread.  YES it is more moist almost cake like but hello....it's keto and that's the point due to the high fat content.   I carefully inspected the 3 packages and they were totally fine.  Yes the bread slightly smells but that is due to no preservatives and the cream cheese.  It toasted perfectly on a longer setting as keto bread will take longer to toast.  I actually had the best experience, found the bread to be delicious and it tasted exactly like my own when I bake it.   This is a lifesaver as I can save time now!   My only request would be for organic unblanced almond flour.   Absolutely I would order again!!!< /text>

I bought the Pro Granola Vanilla Cinnamon Cluster cereal and it is amazing. I haven't been able to have cereal in two months since I started the ketogenic diet. You can snack on it as if it were a cookie as well.  I can hardly wait to try more of their products.<//review>

OR RATHER,  NO STARS!  I have choked down about 2 1/2 pieces of this Keto bread since receiving...(btw it took almost 2 WEEKS to arrive). I should have taken the reviews much more seriously. I am now stuck with THREE loaves of this horrible bread. All I got from customer service was “sorry” and “no”. Anybody got any ideas on how to make this bread palatable?  I’ve tried plain toasted, French toast and a type of bread pudding. What a waste!  UGH—DON’T  DO IT.</text>

Unfortunately nothing good to report about the bread this company sells. I saw nothing but positive comments on a Facebook post advertising the keto thin bread so I decided to give it a try. The taste is nothing short of awful. It tastes and smells like spoiled milk and eggs. I froze per instruction and when thawed, I toasted the bread, go to take it out of the toaster and it crumbled. I tried it again and when I started to apply my peanut butter, it crumbled again. I wouldn't recommend this bread to anyone. Threw $35 in the garbage. Lesson learned.

Edit: I am editing my review from a ONE star to a THREE star based on the customer service I received after I posted my review. They were polite, professional, and understanding and I appreciate that.<//Review>

<review>Absolutely the grossest protein bars ever. I use protein bars to save time and avoid skipping meals and can pretty much tolerate the driest, most tasteless thing out there but this was actually gag worthy. Maybe it's the egg white version ( Because I can imagine that taste being a watered down version of rotten eggs) but I have tasted the chocolate, donut, and cinnamon and I just can't bring myself to try the rest of the box. I had to brush my teeth and drink coffee to get the taste out of my mouth. To add insult to injury, two weeks after placing my order I got an email explaining that they were back ordered and that my order would arrive in a week; it arrived two weeks after THAT date.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Worst customer service I've ever come across. Shady company. I placed an order than never shipped. When I enquired I was told they were backed up and shipping was delayed over 10 days. They never notified me once. When I told them I wasn't happy they cancelled my order. I left a review of my experience on one of their Facebook posts and they deleted it and blocked me from commenting. That's why on Facebook they get great reviews. Complete scam. If you want to know the truth about this company read the reviews on Amazon. Sounds like they did me a favor by not sending me their product.</Text>

I ordered a variety pack of protein bars on April 21, while I was doing a Whole30. They did not arrive until June 3, which is a ridiculous amount of time to wait for delivery (43 days!!!) and of course was long after my Whole30 had ended. I figured I would still like to have them as part of my ongoing efforts in healthier eating. They were horrible. A couple of the flavors were ok enough to eat part of. Most of them I couldn't even choke down a couple of bites. They tasted like plastic. I cannot believe I waited so long and paid so much for such garbage. They say they have a money back guarantee for unopened bars, but this was a variety pack with one of each flavor, so how was I supposed to know I didn't like them without trying each one? It's safe to say now that I will never order from this company again, and with the other reviews here, it looks like I'm not alone.< /text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I was looking forward to the keto thin bread but am very disappointed. It is very dry and bland. Two friends on keto tried it with me and also said they wouldn't want anymore of it.
Ive cooked with almond flour a number of times so Im okay with the taste of almond flour, but this is not good. Also $30 for 3 loafs, and they don't let you order one loaf to try it first. I will be making my own from now on. I also think its shady that all the reviews on their site are perfect 5 star reviews, which doesn't match what people are saying on google.<//review></record>

I ordered the three pack of bread and the granola. The bread tasted horrible. Even toasting it didn’t help. The granola had so much cinnamon in it that it was overpowering. Ended up throwing the granola out and the two remaining loaves of bread. I tried to post a review on both on their website, but neither showed up - I guess they blocked them.

< Review>
Very disappointed in customer service.  Placed an order on May 4.  Order arrived fairly quickly, but one of the items I ordered was wrong.  After a few emails, I finally got a response and the correct item was sent.  Placed a 2nd order, and again, I received a wrong item.  It's been 11 days and no response when I emailed the company.  After placing 2 orders over $100 each, I guess they don't want my business.  It's a shame as I liked the pegan bars I ordered and I was planning on ordering more, but I am taking my business elsewhere.   I am also the disputing the wrong item from my last order with my credit card company since they never responded to my email.<//Review>

I've never written a review in my life no matter how bad or good the experience but now the time has come. The company took my money and never delivered what I ordered. The day I placed my order I emailed them asking about their ingredients because I read mixed reviews. They responded promptly to tell me that they're all natural (which I know now is false), and now I have not received my protein bars and have not received one email or phone call back. They are phony and they are not professional in any way. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND BUY RX bars or something. I've never been more angry with a place in my life.

And now I'm back editing this post because MONTHS later after constant emails to them saying I will get people involved that they don't want to be involved, I received my money back. No email, no apology, no explication, months later. Disgusting place. Like I said, buy Rx bars instead as those are natural and an actual company that will respond to you and treat you like a customer. I would bet big money that this bakerys ingredients are lies as well. Just Google what happened with them in the past.
This is literally my first review on anything and I can't stop ranting.</text>

Only received a partial order.  The boxes of crackers were damaged and the crackers were crumbs.  Will not return phone calls or emails.
This company needs to be shut down.

Update. Received email from Julian Bakery.  They want me to pay return postage on crushed crackers.  Now, saying the rest of my order is being shipped....ignoring the fact I cancelled the order.  This company is definitely a scam.  Don’t buy from them< /review>

Got my order today and I'm torn...I love, love, love the crackers!  However, the coconut bread was terrible :(  I'm going to try and make some french toast or something with it but there is no way I could make a sandwich.  I have only tried one of the protein bars (cookies and cream) and it was okay.  I will be happy to have one in my purse, so I can stay on track.< /text>

Since I am dairy, gluten and soy free it has been challenging to find a bar that fits my needs and that also does not have sugar.  I tried these bars about a year ago and loved them immediately!  I think I need to be put on an auto ship because I have lag time between shipments and without them I am lost!  :-)</review>

I was a little worried because the reviews are horrible but decided to try it anyways. Very impressed from my first order it shipped all the way to Kentucky and only 3 days. A few weeks later I ordered again and it was also shipped in 6 days. They taste Great, especially fried like a tostada,  no problems. Would have gave them 5 stars but I can never get anyone to answer their phone at the bakery.< /review>

<Review>At the beginning of last month I decided it was time to loose some weight. I decided on the keto route. The weight loss is going great but I was still craving bread big time. I ran across a Facebook ad for Julian Bakery and their keto friendly bread. The reviews were all positive regarding the flavor and so forth. I decided to order some. The price is definitely on the higher end for three small loaves of bread but I went with it anyway. It took over three weeks to received my order which is ridiculous for any business. The flavor is nothing compared to what they describe in their own write up. It does not toast at all in the toaster despite they claiming it does. I followed their recommendation of toasting on high. Even did 3 cycles in my toaster on high and never once toasted. It just got warm. I do not recommend this product based on price, shipping time, flavor, and not living up to the description provided by the company.< /Review><UserId.>104387399467467309342</UserId.><Time>1551728740746<//Time></record>

Wanted to love... upon opening, the odor was horrible, tried to toast it , took a bite, almost threw up, gagged on it and spit it out.

< Review>
I like going in to the store. They let me try things and the bread is really good too. It's so healthy I don't know if I can really call it bread. The employees were kind. They have things you can buy to make and create healthy meals. My favorites were all the ingredients to make wraps. I enjoyed the protein bars too and this helps keep one on the paleo diet. I don't know about ordering things online but I have good experiences going into the store. 😊< /Review>

I normally don't leave a rating but in this instance consumers need to be aware.  I ordered the 3 pack keto thin slice bread and when I opened the bag, the bread was slimy and smelled spoiled.  I tried calling Julian Bakery on several occasions on the business days following with no response, then finally emailed.  Their reply to my request for a refund was that I should have contacted them within 24hrs of receiving the bread.  I received the bread on Saturday and they are not open on Sunday.  This is fraud.   Defective products require a refund.  STAY AWAY!< /review>

*** Update 6/13... after having to chase this order down to get the status on it... Now being told yet another week until I receive it. Funny... There was NO delay or issue with them taking my money on May 30th just moments after I placed the order...
Last week's correspondence advised that my order WOULD ship THIS week (6/10). Empty promises.......

Placed order on May 30th... it's now June 13th... Still waiting for any update on when it will ship. Claim they ship on Mondays... Well...2 Mondays have passed... Still nothing. No order, no communication about the status of the order which I was told would ship this week. Very frustrating!!!</text>

Perhaps Julian Bakery needs to rethink their shopping policy, because their products should be delivered frozen. There's no preservatives and the quality is very high. I can't imagine baked goods from this factory would survive a long shipping order. If you can find this product (always frozen, in my experience) in your local grocery store, buy it there.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<review>This place is the worst ever. I bought a loaf of the Paleo Bread, please do not EVER buy this. It is so completely disgusting and smelly, I had to throw away the loaf AFTER paying $14 for it at New Seasons. I emailed the company to let them know and they said they were sorry I didn't like it. I have been a business owner for over 20 years and I understand customer service. They do not. I emailed back and said I had expected more, like here is a coupon to try some of our other products, or would you like to try something else?? They responded since I hadn't bought the bread from them they wouldn't do anything. Well guess what? I will Never buy another one of their products and I will tell New Seasons as well as my nutritionist to not ever recommend their products to anyone. If you read other reviews, same opinions and the responses from the company are full of attitude. Stay away and save your money!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I purchased the triple pack of breads which contained 1 each of almond,coconut and mixed seed. I was honestly amazed at how incredibly awful this bread is. Could barely stand the smell of the bread let a lone eat it.I really tried to like it but there is no way.Can't figure out what makes it tastes so bad.I am pretty good at not having expectations that something is going to taste like what it's not but this was too much.Now I am out $40.00 because they don't accept returns of perishable items .I should have bought it at WholeFoods so at least I could ahve returned it.</review>

< Review>
DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! Big waste of time and money. I ordered on 12/20/18 it is now 1/21/19 still have not received my refund or order! Customer service will not get in touch with you as the last 3 times I have tried to reach them thru have not responded. I did have one encounter with customer service this was on 1/8/19 they said that my order was not even processed yet and they didn't process it due to the fact they didn't want my bread to be lost in the mail because of holiday shipping. First of all I didn't order bread, second no where during the order was there a disclaimer stating orders may be delayed, third now they will not even respond to my refund request and have not sent my order or refund! This is bad business, I wouldn't have been so upset but their lack of response, communication, and customer service skills really are uncalled for. There were many solutions available like either expediting my order or even apologizing for the mix up or even just quickly refunding me. None of the actions were taken.</Review>

<Text>I ordered on 4/14, and received a shipping email that my bars would be shipped on 4/25, and I would receive on 4/27...today is 5/3 and I've gotten nothing. No bars, no update, nothing....am I still getting my order? Am I getting a refund? Did I just donate money to a company that I'll never hear from?
I never saw these reviews prior to ordering, and would not have ordered had I known this was a problem. I'm a little confused as to why I received a shipping email if they are still catching up on orders from when their equipment was broken. And why wasn't any of this communicated? Why didn't they just send me an email saying there was a delay?

I have to agree with most of the posts. I really like the protein bars. I like the various flavors and it really curbs my hunger, BUT the shipping time is terrible. I too had my credit card charged in April and didn't receive my order until June.  6-8 weeks shipping is unacceptable.  When calling all you get is a recording. I wish I could get these bars again but it's not worth the hassle.< /text>

I will post an update after a week of use but I have ordered the regular IK from them in the orange flavor and had great results, but I just didn't stick with a ketogenic diet back then.

Was concern about bad reviews, but took chance and sure enough all the problems every was experiencing came true. What I did is contact my Discover card and complained and showed them the documentation, they credit my account$169.00 and then went after this "Low life Co". It was interesting this "Low Life Co" contacted me a day I notified my credit card co. and wanted to know if I wanted my money back!!! Of course I missed there call and told them to call me (like all the other times) and of course they did not call me, but emailed 3-4 days later.

I do not believe the positive reviews, (Its probably made up names or employees writing the reviews). USE YOUR CREDIT CARD CO AS A LEVERAGE!!!!!!!!< /review>

I have to agree with most of the posts. I really like the protein bars. I like the various flavors and it really curbs my hunger, BUT the shipping time is terrible. I too had my credit card charged in April and didn't receive my order until June.  6-8 weeks shipping is unacceptable.  When calling all you get is a recording. I wish I could get these bars again but it's not worth the hassle.</text>

Absolutely the worst service you can imagine. Our products did not arrive and they did not issue us a refund. We tried to contact them multiple times. Terrible.

If there was an option give no stars we would.< /Review>

<review>I ordered some things a while ago. I was double charged first of all, once i emailed asking about it though, i suddenly got second charge back. After reading other reviews i feel that they probably wouldnt of given it back to me. Also, it took about a week until i was given tracking information. However, even after they "printed" the postal tag it still took several days before was shipped. I feel as though this was only because I emailed and wanted a refund. They never answered and chose then to send it. I'm sure that even if requested refund they will say that they are non perishable items and wont refund even though i requested them to cancel and refund before they even sent it. I did eventually receive the items, but they all taste horrible, the bread is a lot smaller than compared to what i thought it would be based on pictures, most of cookies were just crumbs and one's that arent you cant bite into because just taking them out of package they start crumbling, etc. I will never order from them again. I shouldve done more research before purchasing.<//review>< time>

<Text>First and last order. Wish I would have looked at the many reviews left by unhappy people! Seems this company will say anything to make a buck. When I called to see why there was no status updates on my shipment, I was told that they've been so busy that it hadn't left yet. Others were told a machine broke down. I scheduled a business trip around this shipment. However, since they were dishonest, the box will be sitting out in the elements for a week or more. From what I've read, most people throw out the Julian Bakery products anyway. Emails are not responded to and the person who answered the 800# was of no help. Waste of time and money.<//Text>< resp>

Ordered the Insta Ketones D-Max and some MCT Oil on the 13th and got both products in the mail today. I did ask for an update about 3 days after the order and they were very quick to respond and my order tracking was updated and I knew exactly where my items were, right up until they showed up at my office (not taking chances with porch pirates stealing from my residence)..I am excited to try the Insta Ketones tonight before I go to the gym. I will post an update after a week of use but I have ordered the regular IK from them in the orange flavor and had great results, but I just didn't stick with a ketogenic diet back then. I'm more committed this time and have so far had amazing success. CHEERS!< /text>

I have asked to be removed from their mailing list 4 times and they refuse, so if you don't want to be sent emails every week from here, don't give them your email. If you change your mind and don't want their emails, you're out of luck.<//Review>

I really don't understand the barrage of negative comments here. Yes, there is a delay in shipping but you will get your most definitely. I ordered 4-5 times from this company and got my bars every single time.

The taste varies, some are bad but the good ones are excellent. My favorite is chocolate devil's food cake. Second one is the Vanilla pudding.

These bars will fill you up and curb your appetite. I have zero bloating after eating them and I have a sensitive GI system.

Eat them when they are warm, they are tastier when they are chewy.

Their Ketone body product is not better than its counterparts from Pruvet but it is literally half the price. I really recommend the bars and they are getting much better with their wait time.< /Text>

I agree with all the one-star reviews posted.  Placed my order in late April 2016, only to be told via email that the order will be delayed and shipped in early May 2016.  No updates until I sent a follow up in late May inquiring about the shipment. Response was that they had an equipment problem.  Then I told them that if my order wasn't going to ship by a specific day (today, June 3), I wanted a refund.  They already charged my credit card back in April.  In response, I was told today via email, that the shipping department is "closed" for the "weekend,."  How can they be closed when they know they have tons of orders to get out?  Since when is a Friday not a regular business day?  I have never encountered such horrible customer service from any online orders I have placed at any other company.  There is no effort AT ALL to make the customer happy in any way.   Place order at your own risk.  Be ready for them to charge you make you wait months for your order.  They shouldn't accept orders they cannot fulfill.  For the prices they charge, they should also be able to afford better equipment.

UPDATE (6/6/16): I was assured via email on Friday, 6/3/16, that my order would be shipped today.  Still nothing.  I have requested a full refund. Lets see how long it takes for them to issue the refund.<//Review>

Be warned: Both the product and the customer service are below satisfactory. Moreover, forget about getting your money back. I purchased Julian Bakery Paleo Pegan bars (variety pack, 6 flavors) and backordered paleo protein bars (variety pack as well) at the beginning of August. I received Paleo Pegan bars, tasted them all and had to discard. I tried many bars in my lifetime, these were horrible, both texture and taste, microwaved or not. Just didn't taste like something that is safe to consume. Think clay satursted in refined oil. A month after I placed the order, I contacted them about the backordered bars. I was told that they are out of ingredients and I could either wait or get a refund. Based on my previous experience with their bars, I opted for  a refund. It has been a month since then. I reached out to them a few more times, and I still have not seen my money. Based on the product quality and their conduct, this company should not be in business, period.</Review>

<text>Usually get excellent products from this company, though received a rancid jar of pecan spread. Contacted the company but never heard back. Finally, months later, reached out again and was not met with a friendly and concerned customer service person. Instead of receiving an apology and refund for the bad product, we were told of some 24-hour policy and other "run around" and that we could take photos of the jar; then email them with an explanation, etc. - why should we have to be bothered so much, and certainly didn't feel taken care of. We didn't even care so much about the $10 refund; we just wanted to be sure they were aware of the bad product, etc. I'll share with my patients that they will generally do well with these products, but God forbid they need customer service.</text>< Rating>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>I never leave reviews, but I had to speak on this company. they are TERRIBLE! do NOT order form them! I ordered direct from their website. it took 2 months to receive my order. They sent me a "status" update explaining an issue with some broken equipment (not apologetic at all). In that email, there was sentence about "money back guarantee." I figured I would give them the benefit of the doubt anyway when I FINALLY received my order. They are DISGUSTING! they taste like play-doh and they stick to your teeth.
I emailed them about getting my money back (after all, they did say money back guarantee). WRONG! they told me they would refund me if I mailed all of the bars back unopened. HUH? they wanted me to PAY to send them back in order for me to get my money back? Even AFTER it took them 2 months to send me my order? I assume they repackage returned items (be cautious). This place is a joke. I hope they close down soon! I would give them less  than 1 star, but it is not possible.< /Review><user_id>108895478377872886009< /user_id><Name>Samantha Smith<//Name>< Gmap_id>

<review>I am still waiting for my bars to be shipped after ordering a month ago. I have called twice to be given two dates for shipment that have now passed and, as every one has stated, I had no updates from them, I had to call myself and ask what was going on. If they are so behind in orders, they shouldn't charge our cards until the order actually ships. I wonder now if I will ever get my order. And if you make a negative comment on Facebook, they delete it. I will be calling yet again tomorrow to see what is going on.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<text>I placed an order in early April, never received it.  I emailed the company a month later and they said they were having manufacturing equipment issues.  I asked to cancel my order then and they told me no.  They then told me they would be at my house May 22, still never showed.  A week later, half of my order was at my door. All the bars were melted and mush.  I am returning them unopened and requesting the second half of my order to not be shipped -- though I am sure that request will be denied.  Epically disappointed in this company.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

I ORDERED INSTA KETONES FROM JULIAN BAKERY. The next  day i got a email telling me delivered 3 business DAYS. The next day I started reading THEIR review, and started reading PEOPLE didn't get there orders. So i got a little scared THINKING i might have made a mistake buying from them. I ORDERED on a Wednesday and my order CAME on Saturday. My product was fresh and everything there. I AM pleased WITH my order AND the Girls at customers was very nice. I WAS going to order from ANOTHER company BUT JULIAN BAKERY WAS less expensive.

Horrible customer service ordering online.  Missing items from my order and unable to get a refund or my missing items shipped.  According to my invoice there were 2 items on backorder, still nothing done except customer service tells me the items were shipped.  Even IF I get this problem resolved, I will NEVER order anything from this company again!  Dishonest!!👎👎👎👎👎< /Review>

I would give it a no star if that were an option. I ordered protein bars early April. On Apr 7 I was told I would receive by Apr 14-21. On Apr.14 I received an email stating they would ship shortly. I tried calling but got a dead end answering machine. I received an email telling me they had issues with their ovens but they could send me certain bars. They promised to ship Apr. 26. I've still not received them. I've asked for my money back. Very disappointed,<//Review>

I never leave reviews, but I had to speak on this company. they are TERRIBLE! do NOT order form them! I ordered direct from their website. it took 2 months to receive my order. They sent me a "status" update explaining an issue with some broken equipment (not apologetic at all). In that email, there was sentence about "money back guarantee." I figured I would give them the benefit of the doubt anyway when I FINALLY received my order. They are DISGUSTING! they taste like play-doh and they stick to your teeth.
I emailed them about getting my money back (after all, they did say money back guarantee). WRONG! they told me they would refund me if I mailed all of the bars back unopened. HUH? they wanted me to PAY to send them back in order for me to get my money back? Even AFTER it took them 2 months to send me my order? I assume they repackage returned items (be cautious). This place is a joke. I hope they close down soon! I would give them less  than 1 star, but it is not possible.< /text>

<Text>Same experience as everyone else. I ordered paleo protein bars a month ago and was given a tracking number that never shipped. Zero communication from seller. If I ever receive the bars, I won't order them ever again even if they the best I've ever tasted. Shame on you, Julian Bakery, for your dreadful customer service!< /Text>< Date>

Ya, wow. what's wrong with the people running this place? Arrogant, condescending and rude "customer service" staff. I called today to inquire about a product experience - worst interaction I've had with a service rep in a very long time. Management you better wake up - Is this the brand reputation you desire? Is market demand for Paleo baked goods this high you can operate in such a manner? Maybe I need go start a Paleo Bakery that treats customers with grace and kindness!</Review>

I made a first time purchase from this company.  A box (12 bars) of InstaKetones Protein bars.  When they arrived the box was crushed.  I opened one and could barely eat it!  I had to google the company to look up contact information.  I have to pay to return the product and they are only going to credit me for the 11 bars I am returning.  She stated they could refund me for the 12th if it hadn't been opened.  Well....how would I know if I liked their product if I hadn't tasted it?!?!?</Text>< date>

Here are some:

1.  Paleo Protein Bar (Chocolate Brownie)

My favorite low fat, low sugar, high protein chocolate brownie bar.  Put in a microwave for 50 seconds and it will taste like a real, high fat, high sugar brownie - without all the bad stuff.

2.  ProGranola 12g Protein Cereal Vanilla Cinn (Paleo : Low Net Carb : Gluten Free : Grain Free)

3. ProGranola 12g Protein Cereal Espresso (3 Net Carbs, Gluten Free, Grain Free, Soy Free, 0g Sugar)

It's hard to find low fat, low sugar granola -  and this doesn't taste low fat or sugar free.   You won't feel like you're giving up anything.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>I ordered Paleo chocolate and I received an order confirmation and delivery status that it should be here in three days with a tracking number link. I waited almost two weeks, called them several  times they never answer their phone!! You can't leave a voicemail! Then I emailed them saying the tracking number and information doesnt work and I need to know when it's arriving and copy/ pasted my order information and confirmation. They emailed back saying " due to high demand we ran out of chocolate, would you like a refund for the chocolate or your whole order?" I wrote an.angry email back saying "first off all chocolate was my entire order, I cant believe you would.not have enough inventory when u promise customers it has shipped and will be there soon. If u don't have the decency to offer a discount or to say we will rush it to you as soon as we have more chocolate, and to give a custom a phonecall you are a horrible dishonesty company!!!!!" They issued me a refund for the 30 dollars( which still isn't on my card) and no email back with an explanation or apology! On Amazon they are still advertising the chocolate to get to you in a week. This company are piece of (sh..) liars!! Do not order from them!!!!!!!<//review><Rate>1< /Rate>< pictures>

<Review>Horrible service.  I received notification that my order was processed on February 29, and to expect delivery on March 3.  No delivery every occurred.  I called their 800 number to ask for status, and got their voicemail.  I left a voicemail for them to call me with status.  They did not.  I emailed them to ask where my shipment is. There was no response to the email.  I will not order from this business ever again.  They owe me $32.99 for a non-delivered product.</Review><user_id>102759607841423707894< /user_id>< rate>

Usually get excellent products from this company, though received a rancid jar of pecan spread. Contacted the company but never heard back. Finally, months later, reached out again and was not met with a friendly and concerned customer service person. Instead of receiving an apology and refund for the bad product, we were told of some 24-hour policy and other "run around" and that we could take photos of the jar; then email them with an explanation, etc. - why should we have to be bothered so much, and certainly didn't feel taken care of. We didn't even care so much about the $10 refund; we just wanted to be sure they were aware of the bad product, etc. I'll share with my patients that they will generally do well with these products, but God forbid they need customer service.<//Text>

Do yourself a favor DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS DISHONEST SO CALLED BUSINESS , I placed an order on 04-28-18 and paid for 3 items totaling $49.86 via PayPal I never received the package on May 9th After several attempts calling an emailing Julian Bakery and receiving a USPS tracking # which stopped showing delivery status I had to file a complaint through PayPal they managed to mail me 1 of the 3 items ordered which I received on 05-13-18 and never the other 2 which where priced at $29.99 they responded that I received all 3 items per their tracking # which only 1 was delivered on 05-13-18 and they refuse to issue me a refund. Bunch of thieves promising a 3-4 business day delivery still fighting to get my money back DO NOT BUT FROM THEM.< /review>

I am still waiting for my bars to be shipped after ordering a month ago. I have called twice to be given two dates for shipment that have now passed and, as every one has stated, I had no updates from them, I had to call myself and ask what was going on. If they are so behind in orders, they shouldn't charge our cards until the order actually ships. I wonder now if I will ever get my order. And if you make a negative comment on Facebook, they delete it. I will be calling yet again tomorrow to see what is going on.</review>

Placed my order on 5/2/16. Today is 5/13. No order and no response until I emailed them. Claimed they sent me a tracking number which I never received. Also, that they had an equipment breakdown but never notified me of a delay in shipment. Now they tell me it will be another week before my order ships which means they have held my money over 3 weeks! Last order they will ever get from me!<//text>

I ordered the paleo bread and it was not only delivered damaged but the bread was moldy and soggy. The smell was horrendous.  I immediately threw it in the trash. When I requested a refund the next day from them they said they could not refund my money because they wanted me to get a picture of the moldy bread. I explained to them it was a perishable item and moldy I threw it out. They now refuse to refund my money.  What a disgrace. !!!!  Buyer Beware !!! Barely worth one star<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I wish I would have read the reviews before placing my order and throwing $60 away. Exact same story as the other reviewers... Placed order, tracking # shows there has been no shipment. Over 2 weeks without a word and I have sent emails and called with no response. Also read multiple reviews of moldy bars and bread. Also that the bread has been tested and it has the same or higher glycemic index as white bread. Do not waste your time and certainly do not waste your money on this company. VERY disappointed!

Also of note, read the immature messages "from the owner" in response to some of these reviews. Seriously, the customer has paid money out, they have not delivered on the product yet they are defensive and condescending. I don't understand...< /Text><username>Catherine Wells< /username><Rate>1</Rate><resp>{'time': 1459339052117, 'text': "Catherine,\n\nI am sorry you didn't get a response from us but we did not get any e-mails sent to us by you.

It takes 1 month after shipping label is created to get the product.  They do not respond to customer inquiries about shipping.  Good product if you refrigerate them, awful if you do not (turn to mush).  The shipping is a very serious problem.  I actually have to question exactly where they are made, because it takes 1 month or more for them to arrive.  As such, I will not order again.  Buyer beware.< /Review>

<review>I waited exactly 33 days after I placed my order to receive my products, so don't plan on getting them in the time frame they advertise. Phone calls unreturned, horrible customer service as many of the other reviews suggest. And, when I finally got my stuff, the bread was moldy so I couldn't even try it. The protein bars taste like chalk. The list goes on. I would never order from them again and suggest others not waste their time or money and make your own Paleo products.< /review>< Gmap_id>

These bars were absolutely disgusting. They tasted like cardboard mixed with sawdust. I got the Paleo Protein Bar - Variety Pack with 8 bars in it. I couldn't even fight my way through eating all of what I got. Not to mention the price was outrageous.
They tasted stale and just plain bad. I have had my fair share of protein bars, and I can say, without a doubt, these are the worst I have ever had.
And to add to it, they took about a month to arrive after ordering them.
Do not buy these bars!</Text>

One star because I have yet to get my order.  I have sent 2 emails (from my yahoo account in case someone from the company actually reads this) and called twice to get status on an order I originally received tracing info for.  The package was never sent to the carrier, so I called and was told they ran out and had to make more Monday, would have them by Thursday (today).  Sent  another email requesting status, no response, called again today only to be told maybe next Monday because they were waiting for trucks and there was some storm and yada yada.  Asked why no one responded to my emails and the girl ( of course I got no name) went on a rant about their auto email that does not respond, while I stated clearly I sent emails to the link from the website.  Just want my money back at this point but hope to be able to find a way to reach someone who has a clue what customer service is!!!!!< /text>

I just bought 3 packages of bread and maintained in the freezer as instructed, the bread was spoiled in 10 days, the smell was so bad since the product arrived,  they supposed to last at least at month.

Don't trust the macros. They state the bars are keto friendly  (low carb) but when I tested my ketones after eating 12-24 hours later, my results were completely off. The nutrition information is not truthful.< /Text>

<review>I own 2 supplement stores and purchased a box of Instaketones protein bars....orange burst....the most disgusting bars my staff and I have ever tasted.  The nasty after taste was never ending. The box was 29.99 for 12 bars so not what i would consider a bargain.  2 of my staff couldn't even finish their bar.  I read bogus reviews about the bar before ordering.   Contacted them about a return....nothing open can be returned and return postage is my dime....lol.   This is why supplement companies never last very long; misleading customers and a terrible return policy. Being in the supplement industry, and have eaten 1000s of protein bars, this product should never have made it too packaging.< /review>< pics>

I placed my order Apr 17. I received notification Apr 20 that my order was assigned a tracking number. Apr 22 I was sent an email stating it would be shipping "shortly" and here it is May 9 - still no order -  and when I track the tracking number - the only information provided is:
"The U.S. Postal Service was electronically notified by the shipper on April 21, 2016 to expect your package for mailing. This does not indicate receipt by the USPS or the actual mailing date. Delivery status information will be provided if/when available."

RIDICULOUS! I will be canceling this order, disputing the charge on my credit card and I should've paid attention to all of the reviews.< /text>

<Review>This company is clearly a joke, based upon the numerous negative reviews. They've been using the "Your order was delayed because of a production piece of equipment failing" excuse for months apparently, yet they continue to sell product and issue emails saying "your order was baked and shipped" and even assign a tracking number. Why would you send this email, which is clearly not true, particularly if there was an equipment failure (also, clearly not true)? There are responses from the company dating over a month old that state that the equipment failure was corrected, yet my 2-week old order still gets the same excuse/response. Save yourself the hassle and stick with Quest Bars.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Wish we cold give 0 stars!  Placed order on 4/10, after several unanswered emails, falsely given 2 different ship dates, my order finally was received 6 weeks later.  Order was missing one of the flavors ordered.  Emailed and was told oh we ran out so we substituted, would have been nice to have been asked about this.  Company also removed me from their Facebook page after I posted my experience (there was no false information, foul language, or rudeness in my review) so that others could see my experience.  Actually filed a complaint with the Better Buisness Bureau this morning for this sham of a company.< /Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>I was so excited to have something bread-like on a keto/paleo diet. I didn’t even expect it to be great, I was very forgiving, and still- it’s so incredibly awful!!!  I was surpirised at just how horrible this bread tastes.  I am so disappointed that I bought the 3 pack and am now stuck with 3 of these digusting loaves for $30.  I highly recommend buying one loaf and trying it first. I attempted to force myself to finish at least one loaf because it’s such a waste of money but I simply cannot. It will ruin any meal. I wanted avacado toast but I’ll eat an avacado plain any day before ruining one by slathering it on one of these slices of sawdust bricks. Wish I had read other reviews before purchasing but I reeeeeaaaally wanted to like it.</text>< UserId.>

I had a bad experience with this company first time I ordered but took a chance and ordered again and this time spent $209.96 and over a week later, still no package.  I tried calling numerous times only to find out their voicemail box is full and not accepting messages!  I posted on their Facebook page and ALL my negative comments were deleted and yes I took snapshots of them to prove it! I have a copy of the email I sent them and they didn't bother to respond to that! Something has to be done to stop this company from scamming customers and taking their monies! Buyers beware, order at your own risk!  I am going to consult with my attorney to get my money back!</review>

Their ketone product is a complete scam. They'll Facebook block a doctor who is board certified in obesity medicine to prevent people from finding out that they scam people. That should tell you everything you need to know about them.< /text>

If your machines broke then email all customers waiting. Don't make them call you to see what is wrong. I'm hoping the product is good because their customer service is horrible and some of these reviews I am reading are concerning. So far I am very disappointed.

<review>The only reason why this review is getting one star is because I cannot rate it any lower. I wish I had read the reviews on this site before ordering as it would have saved me $30 I'm probably never going to see again.
I placed an order mid February of this year and received an email a few weeks later that it would arrive April 1st. It was only after 1 week and ME reaching out to THEM did I get an explanation that my order had in fact not shipped because of broken machinery and that my order would ship in the following days. It has been a month since that email and I have neither received my order, nor an update or anything explaining what the heck is going on. I emailed requesting a refund, however I have no expectation that they'll even follow through on that.
Don't waste your time or money with this company.< /review>< Pictures>

As all others have said, it is hard to even give this company one star.  I have never dealt with such poor customer service and so many repeated lies from a company.  I have had the same experience as many others - I placed an order on 5/24.  Today is 7/21 and I am still getting the run-around about broken equipment, being out of stock, etc., etc.  ALL LIES. They do not answer their phone, rarely respond to emails, then every time they do it is a new story/excuse.  They have had my money - nearly $60 - for two months.  I never write reviews, but this is the worst.  I had to say something and will continue to spread the word any way I can!< /Review>

As others have stated, waited a month for my order. Tried contacting the bakery through phone and e-mail. Took a week to get a response. Finally got my product. TERRIBLE. First, the Chocolate Brownie bar, it's beige and not a bar. It is soft and disgusting. I'm pretty sure brownies should be brown. The Almond Fudge bar is covered with a sheen of oil. You can't even hold it. And it is hard as a rock. Never again. What a disaster! These bars are awful.</review>

Slightly annoyed. I ordered a sample box of paleo bars on the 2/28/16. I have yet to receive. I received an email  from them on 3/4/16 saying that a shipping label had been generated with tracking number and that my bars would arrive on 3/9/16 but no movement (according to tracking) on my order since!  I called on 3/10, and they were not very friendly.  The woman said a machine broke down, and they could not make them. They told me I'd get them on Saturday, 3/12... Let's see. At $40 a box I would expect better service!<//Review>

<Text>I purchased the variety pack of the bars and my only complaint is the lengthy wait time.  This is due I understand to the fact they are made to order so, with that I understand.  The bars are an acquired taste I have to admit, however if you are trying to do meal replacements and be healthy - it's is not going to taste like a true brownie.  This is common sense.  With that being said - they are passable in the taste department.  Chocolate mint and coconut shred are so far the best.  I am a busy mom and business owner so I need something to grab and go, at the same time not high in calories, carbs or sugar.  So far I have not found anything else that would meet this standard, most protein bars are full of fake sugars (yuck), soy protein (yuck) and just overall not appealing more than once.  The Paleo bars are, in my opinion, a good substitute if you are looking to replace a meal and are concerned about GMO's, gluten and fake sugar.  I only wish they were available locally.  Give them a try, everyone is different in their preference of taste.</Text>< Pictures>

I was sent an email that my paleo bars had shipped on 4/18/16-expected on or around 4/20- but the tracking number went NOWHERE! Called and got generic message that equipment was down, orders delayed until 5/12. My question to Julian Bakery is this: How can my order be affected by the equipment failure when it has already shipped??! No email was sent with an explanation or apology, and obviously I am not the only one! I certainly would be much more forgiving had you reached out to me and others. Get your customer service mojo on, Julian! For a start-up wanting to make and retain customers, this is not a class act.<//Review>

I had read on a blog about how delicious Julian Bakery paleo bread was.I placed and order for their paleo bread.  3 1/2 weeks had gone by and I still had not received it.  I sent an email and there was no reply. I called many times, but no one ever picked up the phone.  I finally got lucky, and someone answered.  I was told that my order had been misplaced.  Two or more weeks had gone by before I received the very expensive paleo bread.  It was an extremely small, small loaf.  It was the worst tasting thing I have ever tasted.  There was even an off taste to it.  It was a waste of time, money, and taste.< /text>

I am not an employee at this company. I am not being paid to write this review. This is not a fake account. While I can't speak to people's issues with shipping, the products are great. I have been supplementing ketones into my daily diet as well as before my runs and I feel great. People who complain about the flavor of these products clearly have not tasted other ketone supplements! Does this taste like kool-aid or candy bars? heck no! But that doesn't mean they taste bad either! Julian Bakery, don't let these nasties get you down. Keep up the good work!</Text>

<review>If I could give 0 stars, I would.
I purchased the protein bars, fully anticipating they would not taste like a "normal" brownie or doughnut. Not only did they not taste like a doughnut or brownie, they did not taste like anything remotely "normal." The texture, in and of itself, was just awful.
That being said, I placed my order and received it 1 month later...which after several phone calls to customer service, and emails, I never heard from anyone! I had to resort to Social Media just to get a response and to get my bars sent to me. AND THEN, they deleted my comments to make it seem as if they had been on their game the whole time. This was not the case!

I appreciate the company's vision, but cannot stand behind the execution at all.<//review><Name>John Klock<//Name>< Resp>

<text>Placed an order on May 21, reached out on May 23,  to get shipping info. was sent a tracking #, that (as I type this), claims the label was created and is waiting to be picked up, since May 23. I have sent 4 emails, and left 2 voicemails (no one ever answers the phone), nothing from them. I am cancelling my order, reporting them to Amazon and disputing the charges. I knew Paleo bread was too got to be true...<//text>< Date>

THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE! NO ONE RETURNS CALLS AND LIKE HUNDREDS OF OTHER CUSTOMERS, WE RECEIVED MOLDY BARS AFTER WAITING OVER 5 WEEKS! IF THESE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS, THEY WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS SOON! THEY HAVE REFUSED TO MAKE THIS RIGHT WITH US AFTER LEAVING NUMEROUS MESSAGES FOR A CALL BACK. THEY HAVE FAKE PB POSTINGS AND OPERATE POORLY. HORRIBLE!</Text>

If I could give them 0 stars I would. I placed my order a month ago and still haven't received it. They don't respond to emails or voicemails. Bad customer service. I finally asked for a refund and was told I had to wait an additional week for that!
I was excited to try the paleo bars but it's not worth waiting for an order that might not ever come! They don't even have the curtesy to let you know that they aren't shipping your order!
If you live in San Diego and can walk to the store and buy on site great! Don't waste your time or money online.<//Text>

<Text>I had the same experience as one of the other reviewers when I called I was told of an equipment malfunction and my order has not been baked. Then voila! I received my order in two days. I ordered the coconut flavor and the vanilla pudding flavor and both were horrible. It's like chewing taffy that never ends...not like gum, but taffy because it sticks all over the insides of your mouth. I sent them back and waiting over a week (7days) for a refund. The reviews on Facebook must not be legit. I had to stop Julian Bakery from showing up in my newsfeed.< /Text>< Response>

<text>Wish I could give this a NEGATIVE 5 STAR rating!  This company is a joke!  I ordered my bars on 4/26.  I've received a 'pre-tracking' number and that's where it sits.  I understand having equipment failure....but when I'm given 3 different time frames for delivery it gets frustrating.  No one answers the phone and the emails I send always come back with a new and extended delivery date and then the comment "the wait will be worth it".....nothing this frustrating can be worth it and I will NEVER purchase from this company again.  I really think you potential clients should heed mine and everyone else's one star warning!

<text>I have always loved their products, especially the paleo bread, but the shipping time used to be awful! They have totally improved on that, my last order came in less than a week. Their new paleo crackers are like, life changingly good! I wasn't a huge fan of the old almond flour crackers, they were soft and crumbly, and pretty bland. The new crackers are crunchy, and have a great flavor. I love to use them alone as a little snack, or with some raw cheddar, or tuna, they are awesome. Love this company and their products that make eating paleo so much easier!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

It was so hot  (FL) that the supplements and the noodles are destroyed.  The mailing address I used  and the one on my credit card when I placed the order s a different address then my business where I received a door tag.    Not even sure how they found my business.

I wish I could give this no stars they are that bad... After reading what I thought were honest reviews on Facebook, I decided to order the variety pack. What I should of done first was do a google search on this company, because it turns out they are a scam and are being reviewed by the FDA for false advertising of their ingredients and promise. But instead of doing that I went off what I thought was the truth..and the truth is these bars are awful and down right disgusting!!!
They buy promoted Facebook ads and only display the fake positive comments. If you trying leaving a comment that is in anyway negative, they will delete it. A company that cares about their customers would of tried to rectified the situation, but instead they just delete and sweep it all under the rug. THEY ARE A SCAM! STAY AWAY!<//Review>

This is the review that I have posted on Yelp.  Evidently the owners never respond to those reviews, so I will post it here.  In addition, I guess I am an idiot, because when I called regarding my last order (placed 3/22 and still not received as of today 4/26) the girl assured me that it was a Paleo bar problem and if I had ordered the primal bars they were shipping out immediately.  So like an idiot, I ordered the primal bars on 4/18 and still no bars! and of course, no response..... I love these bars, and it is horrible that they cannot work out the shipping issues.

YELP REVIEW:
This is going to be a mixed review because I absolutely LOVE their Paleo bars.  I am not a big fan of the flavors that I originally thought might be my favorite, mint & cookies and cream, but they are still ok.  I have ordered the variety packs to get each flavor.  My favorite are glazed donut, cinnamon roll, coconut shred, and  caramel.  If you have tried low sugar/high protein products you will appreciate the great taste and wonderful texture of these bars.  If you are new to the low sugar/high protein market, I could understand how it might not be what you were expecting, For medical reasons, I had to drastically reduce my sugar intake, while also increasing my fiber and protein.  I have tried many many products and this one has become a staple for me.  I was so happy to find something that satisfies a sweet craving while providing lots of protein and fiber both.  That being said about the wonderful product....

The shipping is a joke.  I have a few other products I would love to try but they can't seem to get the bugs worked out on their shipping issues.  I live in the country (way out) and USPS is the worst possible way to receive deliveries.  I am into my third order  placed on 2/3/16 (each order having it's own shipping issues).  On this order, 2/5 I received a confirmation, and on 2/8 I received a tracking number that my package would be shipped 2nd day USPS on 2/10. On 2/10 I received another email stating it had left and should arrive to me by 2/12.  The tracking number that they provided still hasn't left the store as of today 2/16/16.  I sent 2 emails asking for updates with no response.  So I called today and the girl answering the phone, Katie, said that they had encountered some problems in production and my shipment had not left yet.  I am absolutely not upset at all that something has come up in production.  I am upset that no one would answer my emails about food getting lost in our postal service for 6 days.  Communication makes all the difference in the world.  If their shipping information was dependable, I would absolutely rate them a 5 star business.  I sure hope they work this out (UPS and Fed Ex are much more reliable).

I am a huge fan of their product and was excited about trying more items, but it doesn't do any good to make a good product that you can't get delivered.<//Review>

<Review>Good product, terrible logistics and service.

First, the good: I think the Paleo bars are actually quite good. Note that they use Stevia and not sugar... so they do have the aftertaste usually associated with alternative sweeteners. Thankfully it doesn't bother me, so I quite enjoy the bars. I'd say the cinnamon roll ones are my favorite. These have helped me curb my sugar addiction, for sure!

The OK: Some of the bars are a little oily, as others stated, but whatever. They are soft and chewy kind of like the big sticks of tootsie rolls. Most of the bars use egg protein which sits with me better than whey. But, with a lot of high-protein, high-fiber foods (at least in my experience), they can cause cramps. Again, I've not been affected by this - but a friend who tried a bar from the same batch I was eating said they got cramps. I guess it varies from person to person.

The bad: Their shipping is an absolute joke. Three orders, and it's always the same. Wait two weeks for the shipping notification and tracking number. (Two day shipping, right?) Then, another week or two from getting the tracking number to when they actually bother to ship it. *Then* it actually comes in 2-3 days. It's 4-5 week minimum wait from when you order.

And you know what? I'd be OK with that if they were just up front about this. I've never actually gotten a hold of any customer service rep (I did try emailing the "sales" address, to no avail). But from the excuses I've seen: swamped with orders, machine malfunction, whatever, it sounds like it wouldn't matter. Unless they have a machine breaking down every time I order, they're just not being honest with themselves about their real turnaround time. FINE. Just be up front on the site that it takes a while... and don't tease me with a tracking number which is useless for another week (or two).

I'm currently waiting on what will probably be my last order. It's a shame, really... Just a little more transparency and messaging and everything would be fine, and this would be a 5 star review. But seeing the same complaints (and responses) going back for years, it seems like they just don't get it. Too bad.< /Review>< resp>

Ordered April 3rd and was told via email my bars were shipping the 18th and would be delivered the 20th.  Called on 20th when my bars didn't come and was told their machine broke and my flavor couldn't be shipped until the following week but I'd get it by saturday.  Emailed back the next Saturday and was told the machinary still wasn't fixed (its April 30th at this point) and that I'd have to wait until may 18th for my order to be shipped.  I refuse to wait 2 months for a shipment if bars.  I tell then I want a return or to change flavors.  I'm told it will be shipped the next Monday.  Its Tuesday and my tacking order still shows it hasn't been taken to the post office.  To make it worse their customer service is horrible.  Not once did i receive an apology.  I also find it annoying that not once did they take it upon themselves to send me an update "just a heads up.  Our machinary broke and your order is delayed." Nope.  I had to keep being the one to hunt them down.  I will never do business with this company again.  RUN!  Save yourself the stress.  Too bad you can't do reviews on Facebook or post to their wall.  Also no one responds to my email anymore and when you try to call their mailbox is full and you can't speak to an actual person.  Even tho its their business hours.  Its also a lie in their responses that they "apologize people didn't get the email sent out.". Bull.  There was no email sent out.<//text>

Ordered 4/3/16. Received an email that my order would be freshly baked on 4/11 and I would receive by 4/13. No communication on the delay. I have called 2 xs same story about being behind in production due to machine problems. No one we emailed me to tell me about a delay. Shipping tracking number made and no movement. Called yesterday and ask they just ship me something whether it be a complete value pack or not. Told it would ship yesterday and I would revive on 2 days. Still no movement on tracking number. I paid through PayPal I guess I am going to have to ask paypal to help get refunded. This is ridiculous turn around time. I tried to comment on Facebook in the feed to warn others and it is removed everytime so only positive feedback shows. Today is 4/22/16! So disappointed wish I would have read reviews.<//review>

If I could give zero stars, I would.

This is entirely regarding their online business and has no bearing on their brick and mortar, which I have never visited, but if you're considering ordering online from them, RUN - DON'T WALK - to literally any other supplier.  I placed an order back at the end of March.  I was told it would ship in early April.  I was sent a tracking number and told that I would receive my product by April 8th.

April 11th rolled around and the shipping status was still "pending," so I emailed them.  No response.  I emailed a second time.  No response.  (AND YES, I CHECKED MY SPAM FILTERS, THANK YOU.  Nothing in spam, either.) Thank God I went through PayPal, because I then opened a ticket with them.  Three times I attempted to contact them through PayPal's system, and sure enough - no response.  I escalated to PayPal, which gave them 10 days to respond to PayPal itself, and - you guessed it - NO RESPONSE.  I was just issued my refund through PayPal because the bakery never even replied.

I don't know what their deal is, but their online sales practices are extremely shady.  Not worth it, but if you absolutely MUST try, use your PayPal account - DO NOT give them your credit card information, because if they can't even reply to PayPal, the probability of you getting a refund should you fail to receive your product is likely null unless you have PayPal's arbitration to back you up.

I'll likely be filing a few reports regarding this company, because I'm not sure if they realize this, but their business practices are seriously toeing the "fraudulent" line (and that's being generous, since I'm pretty sure, based on other complaints on here, that they've long since fully jumped over that line).  I can't emphasize this enough - DO NOT ORDER ONLINE FROM THEM.</review>

Ordered the Paleo Pure Protein (Egg White Protein) 2lbs last month to use it in my morning shakes. Received it a few weeks later. The product tasted like rotten eggs. Tried it 3 times and trrew up every time it was tried.So I called them & requested a return & was told by their sales girl Katie to ship it back at my cost.
They received it last Thursday & now they replied that they will not issue any refund. Terrible product...even worse customer service.
Do NOT recommend this horrible product. Waste of money.< /text>

<Review>They have changed the recipe on the Protein Paleo Bars.  They have a most discusting after taste.  I just dont like them.   I wish they would go back to their original recipe.  I really don't want to give them even one star but I had to in order to post my opinion.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

To the folks at Julian Bakery: Intentionally or not, you seemed to have duped a lot of people who had high hopes in you and your products. It appears you have continued to sell your bars and gladly taken payments all the while knowing you have not fulfilled orders for months. No emails, same old excuses...bad karma, Julian Bakery. Attempting to be buyer, beware!< /Review>

<Review>pitiful excuse for a business, like many others, I ordered (4-6-16) and have yet to receive the order (5-4-16). In the meanwhile I asked for a refund on 4-30, but no response on that either. It's my hope that businesses like this close up shop since they don't deserve the right to based on past practice. If you research the company and owner it won't take long for you to figure out it's a very troubled outfit.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Is this company still in business ?
It has been over 1 week they changed me but no one answers calls or emails for refunds or order updates

Their products are great but the service is the worst ever

Had an appropriate at 9 arrived at  8:45am I was the first person there noticed multiple people entering before me and they arrived after us so I went to ask what was going on... no one sits at the reception so I had to wait again till they popped in I noticed they had scribble out my name  so instead of asking if i was here they took it upon there self to cross out my name.  Mind you they asked if my name was on the list and I gave them my name grrrr... 😠</Review>

<review>Don’t go here. The X raid technician and the office manager were great. However. The first dentist I saw when he numbed me it numbed my eye! He acted like it was no big deal. It was terrifying. I couldn’t blink for over an hour and they didn’t even care. He started to work on me without covering my eye or giving me any type of moisturizer for my eye. The Novocain had wore off a bit, I still couldn’t Blink, I could feel him drilling in my mouth I told him to stop.

I left the office. I was charged $3000. I came back two days later because he had left a sharp tip on one of my teeth. From the drilling. The second dentist I saw was a woman. The rudest  professional I have ever met in my life. She was angry at something— maybe me? She was very rude. I complained to the office manager and left again. I did get a cleaning from a great hygienist but I was still charged $3000. I did complain to the corporate office and they felt that I deserved no money back at all.

Think I’m kidding? You can go there and find out for yourself. I repeat:   do not go here. They should be out of business.</review></record>

Horrible customer service!! Had an issue with my bill and Went there to resolve my payments, and there were 2 girls at the front desk and they just dont want to answer your questions and they try everything to get rid of you. I asked the girl so who should I talk to for my payments and she said you can talk to jene. She doesn't even have a phone number or extention to talk to her directly. So I've beed contacting them and everytime the girls bring some lame excuse as if she can't respond. I went to the office a few times and they either say she's at lunch or she's not here. Totally regretted doing business here</review>

Man, I don’t know how this place only has 2. something stars. HONESTLY. It’s beyond me. This place has done an absolutely AMAZING job with my teeth. They are literally the friendliest people ever. From secretaries in the front, to doctors pulling teeth. They’re all so nice. I got a tooth pulled and I kid you not, it took them 10 minutes. It was super quick and absolutely painless. I wouldn’t recommend going anywhere else!!! This is the dentist you wanna come too!!! I love it.</Text>

We get here at 135pm just to be told that since it's the weekend our insurance couldn't be verified 🤬. Shouldnt that have been considered when they made the new patient appointment?

I would give them negative ratings if possible. Please avoid coming here.I came here in Oct 2019, after my first visit I decided not to come here.  I requested them to send my X rays to me via e mail. They refused. I was told I have to pay them a visit and bring them a USB. When I went to the office I was told I needed a new USB. I got them a new USB and then they asked me to cone some other day.< /Review>

The price is not affordable!!! I would have to say the front office are amazing though. Jeanette, Patty, Margaret are very helpful and kind. If it wasn’t for these workers I probably wouldn’t be so happy. But they always make my visit pleasant. One thing I didn’t like was I felt like the accounting department gave Me a product that they wanted to give me I asked for a specific electric toothbrush and I was pinned with a western dental one. This product does not work well and now I’m stuck with the bill. Not happy about this situation. They didn’t let me choose after I asked for a kids toothbrush for my daughter. The front staff though are truly amazing and always are kind and very helpful. They go above and beyond.</Review>

<Review>After walking out of an appointment last week due to a lack of a Dentist with sufficient implant experience.  The office took action and brought back the Dentist I had been working with (who was suddenly transferred to another office) to complete the procedure.  Dr. Nathan did a wonderful job, explained each step, did the necessary verifications (xrays, etc) after each step.

My rating for this visit is 5 stars, but my overall rating of the Western Dental Burbank Office is “2 Stars”.  The constant changes in staff make it impossible for the follow-thru of a long treatment plan and there is no guarantee that the replacement has the necessary knowledge and skills to complete the treatment plan.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1559248213847, 'text': 'Dean, we are happy to hear your experience was to your expectations.

I hate going to the Dentist. But as soon as I came in to Western Dental/116 to get my process started... Janette and Margaret made me feel at home. They ran the process smoothly and professional and gave me great comfort in explaining the process on getting all my 4 teeth extracted.
Thank you guys, and the whole team.< /review>

<review>Update Jan - 20 - 2020

They made me an appointment and when I came they were closed for renovations. This is without informing me!

-----
Woman hung up in my face when I asked her to explain which teeth were the 1st and 16th.

She seemed increasingly frustrated with me as the short call progressed. She eventually told me what was happening, before I could speak quickly said "ok" in an angry tone (as if I asked something unreasonable) then hung up in my face.

Very unprofessional. Don't take your bad day out on your clients.

-----------

this isnt the first time i've had problems with them

- I've had a denist go on lunch break in the middle of my appointment. I just left.

- Another time they put a filling in my tooth, and it fell out the next day.< /review><resp>{'time': 1572975940415, 'text': 'Eddie, we apologize for the service you received, we assure you we only aim for all of our patients to receive the best experience possible.

<Text>Do not come here! I was weary of low-quality Dental offices when I first came, but I was a college student at the time on a tight budget and decided to proceed anyways. It has been a terrible experience, one I wouldn't want any one to relive! From the lack of appointments for tightening braces, to the confusion in their billing, please guys don't frequent this Western Dental office. I'm most sad that I had my credit score affected on an error committed by this office. Because they didn't see that I had previously updated my address, I was sent to collections because of this address change. Never had I been contacted! My number hasn't changed in 10 years so I'm certain they could have called! These guys are the definition of low-quality dentistry. I or anyone else I know will ever be back...</Text><user_id>113179432071825843653<//user_id>< response>

Do you like waiting for hours and hours?  I don't either.  This facility is nothing but waiting, and I am really upset with the shear amount of time that I have to wait here.  It's not a one time problem either, it's consistently slow.  DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME.</Review>

I came in today to get my chipped tooth fixed. This was my very first visit. I honestly have mixed feelings about this place.  I will begin with the front desk girl. So nice and polite.  Right away greated me with a smile and was very quick with the paperwork. Once that was done. I was taken in for Xrays. The nurse that took Xrays  was also very nice and professional. When the Xrays where taken, they took me to see the hygienist. Wow...I've never seen such an unprofessional behavior. She was extremely rude and full of attitude. Constantly interrupting me while i was trying to explain to her my health history. Then was trying to convince me that I am lying to her about my teeth cleaning. I am not sure what her name was, but she was a young woman. I wont return there again. Will look for a different dentist now because i just do not want to deal with rude people. Btw. The actual dentist is good. But I am sure there are other offices with great staff as well as a good doctor.</review>

<review>So far this has been an unpleasant first two visits, my first time here I waited 2 hours to be seen. When I was finnaly in the back, they were in a hurry because they close for lunch, so nothing was done.  Now I'm here on my second visit and my appointment was at 9 am, it is currently 10:15 and I haven't been seen. At 9:45 I asked the receptionist what was taking so long and she said she didn't know because she had registered me a while ago.she went to check and the back office informed her their dentist had cancelled and another one was coming in and he would be here by 10am.  I'm still waiting!</review>< Pics>

My son and I had our first and last appointment with this terrible group. While I sat in dentist chair, a coat came in to examine my teeth. She walked in with gloves already on she has something in her hands b-lined to the trash can to toss it than came to me and said open your mouth. I said no thanks. I found my son before they started on his mouth and ran out. I want to know why she thought it okay to trash something without changing her gloves and use same gloves on me? I am not slow nor mentally ill. I watch and I am a thinker who processes quite well...!!!< /Review>

Well I came in year ago to get regular cleaning and check up. What ever my insurance covers.  They said they needed to do alot of work . On my teeth.  But that my insurance covers only a part . And that I needed to pay 7,000 dollars and some change. I told the salesperson for that location I could not afford that at that moment. Its been a year and they haven't called me. To schedule a regular year to year check up or anything.  Now I'm in alot of pain.  I have to wait 30 days to change dentists provider's . So it's all bad now.my side cheek is swollen and I'm in pain. All because they fail to pay attention to the small cases now it's become a problem for me. If you don't have money to spend don't come to this places they don't care about human's health or well being. All they care about is money money.</text>

< review>
My husband came into Burbank office and needed a tooth extracted. They helped a bit and pulled it. Gave a big speech about taking the Painkillers they were giving him for a tooth extraction. They gave him 600 mg ibuprofen and proceeded to lecture about only taking these in extreme pain due to addiction. But like we told them we have a cabinet full of over the counter ibuprofen and they acted like the 600 mg was something crazy addictive. Just weird to make such a fuss over over the counter Ibuprofen and act like it is a hardcore painkiller. Just keep it real. All burbank life residents are not all stupid.
The pharmacist at CVS by Ralph's stated

"maybe that Dr is taking your Painkillers we never heard of that."  Drs acting like ibuprophen is a painkiller.

We need dentures will give an update next appointment.< /review>

Waiting time is ridiculus, my husband was left in a room for over 3hrs with no work done. I asked the receptionist 3 times if he had been seen yet,she said she would check but I got no response. After 3 and a half hrs I said to receptionist if you have NOT started his procedure yet please send him out of there and I will go elsewhere, well 10 mins later he comes out with a bleeding mouth with gauze in there, and we leave. We had just got home & they called back to say he had to go back as surgeon had not completed his work. I specifically said we would leave if work had NOT been started.My husband said surgeon came in cut his gums then said to another dentist who came in the room. "come & look at this work I did on this other patient" and he left hubby in the chair, it was then the receptionist came in the room and said" your "mama" says you have to leave NOW and brings him out. First of all my hubby is 62 and I am 65 I am DEFINITELY NOT his mama. Very unprofessional and wait times are for ever. Stay away.</review></record></dataset><record>

An incompetent center. Made an appointment for the first time, spend an hour in the phone with their "first time - insurance verification employee"  to make sure insurance could cover our appointment or procedures. Of course when we get there " oh I'm sorry we don't take your insurance". OMG...waste of time. If you care about your time find another place.< /text>

PATIENTS BEWARE!!! FRAUD ALERT!!!! I made an appointment here because they had a special for a free consultation exam with x-rays. As soon as I went in I mentioned to them regarding the special and it was confirmed by Patty. She said since I mentioned it to her then she will honor it. Who says that ?? Horrible way to talk to a patient. That's their corporate special and they need to abide by it. The over all experience was bad. I was trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. The x-ray was room was disgusting. I felt like I was at a free general clinic. The cleaning was awful! It's not even done by the doctor. It was done by the dental assistant. She was slow and it took her only 5 mins to clean. No results. Teeth still the same. Didn't scrub good. She obviously didn't care about the patient. The doctor was very nice when I met him and was understanding and caring but the whole experience felt like they were pushy sales people trying to make money. The amount they were trying to charge me was more than an actual dental practice not a general multi provider clinic. I signed exactly for the authorized charges for services rendered that day. The consultation exam and x rays were free. They pushed me to buy a nasty unnecessary mouthwash to apparently "help" the gums. This could have been a prescription and could have been prescribed by the doctor but instead they wanted to sell it and make a sell. No proper sealing on the bottle either. I had this appointment in October and today they called saying I was a balance of $104 !!! This is what I mean by fraud ! I payed exactly for services rendered on that day. No other services were rendered. I was provided documentation of what was rendered and that I payed for the services. There is nothing else to try to bill me for. I will not pay for any unauthorized fraudulent charges billed by Western Dental!!! Complete scam !! Avoid this place !!! Horrible place!!! This place is not affordable !! Go to an actual dental office not a pretend to me cheap clinic because they will rip you off. I didn't care about the appointment I was just never going to come back here but since I got this nasty phone call by western dental regarding the fraudulent charge, that's what pushed me to write this review. Customer service rep on the phone was rude as well. Avoid this scam place !</review></record></dataset><record>

Their bad work literally fell out of a family member's mouth several times and had to be fixed by a real dentist who said they ruined the teeth forever. You'd be much better going to Tijuana for cheap dentistry.<//Review>

Didn't want to give one star, but could not post without at least one!
This by far the worst dentist I have ever been to. The customer service was horrible, there was only one dental hygienist didn't clean my children teeth, only polished them. We waited for over 30 minutes to get in the back and then over 30 minutes before seeing the hygienist. We were never offered a seat until after 20 minutes of complaining about the lack of seating and customer service. When I was finally asked if I would like to sit my youngest was about to be done so that was pointless. Please stay away from this place, even if you have MediCal, they do not care about you and you deserve better!</review>

Terrible  experience since I went on time and the receptionist tells me that the Dr . wants me to come back.  They should have called me before I went there.  I didn't even get an  apology.  I just told them that I wouldn't come back here since they should have called if he was too busy.  That's why I had an appointment.  A simple call and I would have went later.</text>

<review>Took 1hour and 50 mins to get an X-Ray and look through the mouth. Who knows how much longer it will take to get a regular cleaning done. Terrible receptionist. The workers inside were friendly and nice, but hat was the only upside to this place. Has no respect to patients' time. Never took more than 20 mins to do this in other dental offices. Writing my review as I wait for my 2hour long cleaning. Hopefully, I get out by my 3rd hour.< /review>< Pictures>

worst dental corporation,  they don't care about yor health,  its all about taking money away from you and damaging your credit. if you are late fir appointment they will charge you a reschedule fee and if you make a contract monthly payment that day, they will apply your monthly payment to the reschedule fee first, then later you will get screwed with a late fee because your last payment was not enough and will report it to your credit as late payments,  even though you made your payment on time, plus the costumer service is horrible,  they transfer you around the world first , put you in hold forever, their offices look and feel like emergency rooms, where you have to wait forever to be seem and their billing department is the worst to deal with if you find a mistake that ultimately you give up and just ed up paying them extra unnecessary fees just to get it over it. Worst Dental Services ever,  stay away ad support smaller and friendlier doctors.</text>

<Review>Sitting in the exam room right now, an hour after my appt. time. I still havent been seen. Just overheard the dentist tell the assistant to "wait on the three in the exam room". Not a single perso has come to see me since I had a god awful x-ray session with a very rude assistant. This is astonishing to say the least. Service here is not what I would expect from any professional medical office and is very disappointing. I highly recommend going elsewhere, and I havent even gotten my teeth cleaned yet!< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1534534318636, 'text': "Ocean's 7/11, we are sorry to hear that your appointment was not up to your expectations.

The service is great and everyone is friendly but the only reason why I rate 4 star is because they won't fix my gums in the middle of my two front teeth I did some research and if they don't get rid of it by the time they take my braces off the two front teeth can separate AGAIN 😞</review>

<text>Stay away from this office in Burbank ca. The Doctor in charge lacks time management and professionalism. My appointment was at 11, finally The doctor saw me at 12:40, spent 4 mins with me. Did not seem knowledgeable, I've seen many dentists before and this lady lacked expertise.  Later her assistant comes over and says we need to reschedule you for cleaning and cavities. I said to her "I've been here since 11 there were only 2 patients before me" She says I don't know I just got here and she has other patients". I got up and left. Ridiculous and pitiful service. Western Dental is a disgrace of a company, I'm staying away from this place you should too. Save the headache!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< review>
I went to this office to have a tooth extracted.  I waited for 3 hours to see the dentist.  They did an assessment. Brought me to the finance office where perks helped me.  They were going to do 3 extractions on my right side. Then wait a month to do 3 on the left side because of health condition and being pre diabetic.  Well this was explained to the oral surgeon.  He understood.  They brought me into the chair.  The oral surgeon and the assistant were upset that they were staying late.  So,  he started pulling teeth. He pulled 6 and broke 2 crowns.  It felt like he was tenderizing meat.  Pulling my head from one side to another.  He was pounding into my mouth like you would pound a nail to the wall. When the office manager came she said.    I guess it was better they did all at once.  They handed me a prescription without a doctor's Npi on it.  Pain for days.  From fri they next  Thursday.  Till from all calling thru different numbers.  They gave me an rx. The office manager offer to fix my broken crowns. That they wanted my gums to heal.  I been calling for the past 2 weeks. They tell me she is on meetings, busy, lunch or not there.  I called last Friday.  They said she will call me back.  She never did.  Today I call corporate and told me that they I been calling the wrong office. Gave me a wrong phone number. I call the office directly to be treated rudely. And told me that perla was on vacation.  There was nothing they can do. I told them what can I do. They told me I can do anything i wanted.  I told them maybe call the state board of dentistry. They told me that for me to do whatever I wanted to do. And they hung up on me.  I need a resolution today.  Not in 30 days</review>

TLDR: Impressively incompetent, dirty, and scammy. Do not waste your time, money, or teeth. Also, there are ants.

I had to give them my insurance information four times before it stuck. Two of these times they called me at work. I was in for a simple cleaning. It took over two hours, in large part because they didn't call me until about 40 minutes after my appointment has supposed to start. I just started a new job and left early for this appointment, so this made me really angry. Complete indifference when I asked what was going on.

A hygienist started polishing my teeth, stopped because she said the machine wasn't working (which made sense given that the paste was all over my face, my hair, my arms, and my pants) and then left without rinsing out my mouth. A few minutes later another woman came over to tell me that it would be another ten minutes because someone was on break. When a woman did come over to finish the polishing (using the "broken" machine) she wasn't even wearing her face mask properly and kept shoving the vacuum down my throat. Note that that was just the polishing, it took another two people to finish the cleaning.

The dentist did not bother to introduce himself and spent maybe a minute with me. He then recommended some procedures, one of which I had never heard of and was not covered by my insurance. When I asked the hygienist what the benefits were, the only thing she could tell me that was it, "makes your gums feel cleaner." Yeah, I am not about to pay $360 out of pocket to make my gums feel cleaner if that's the only reason to do it.

After the appointment I was contacted saying I owed $144 for opening an account with Western Dental. I had no idea what they were talking about. I called the dentist office and they were charging me $94 for fillings I had not had done and $50 for X-rays which they had previously said the insurance was covering. I asked multiple times before I left if I owed anything and they had said that everything was covered. I've checked with my insurance and the X-rays are covered, so I have no idea what their problem is.

Oh yes, and they have ants. Everywhere.

To sum up: they are inconsiderate, incompetent, and rude, they will try very hard to suck your wallet dry, and the place is filthy with I do not want to know what and ants.< /Review>

As the first two reviewers indicated, this was by far the absolute worst dental experience I have ever had in recent years.  I was seen by one dentist who left me waiting in the share, and then another dentist took over about 30 minutes later who didn't even have the courtesy to identify himself or explain why he was seeing me instead of the first dentist who examine me.  Above and beyond all, the dentist proceeded to inject me with novacaine on the left side of my mouth despite my efforts to ask for an explanation.  When he finally stopped, I explained that I was being treated for a crown in my upper right side following a root canal completed by a private endodontist at a different location.  The dentist responded, "Why didn't you tell me?  Next time let the dentist know which side they're treating."  He didn't even bother to read my chart!  Then he left me waiting in the chair for another 40 minutes.  The worst, worst place ever.  Stay away at all costs!!!<//Text>

The worst western dental I ever delt with EVER. Every time I try to get in touch with the office they don't answer or direct me to another office. I go to talk to them personally and there office is closed, but online it says that there open. BS, nobody has any customer service skills over there what so ever. I'm trying to take care of my insurance with them and they lost my original paper work. I went back to review my status and they told me I didn't exist. Now they completely lost my trust because that's my information that they lost. How unprofessional is that.I can't take it anymore, if nothing gets taken care of soon there's gonna be legal issue brought to there attention. Western dental is completely responsible for the staff and management they hired at the Burbank location so for that they better fix it because theyre gonna go out of business just because of there employees.< /text>

Been going here since moving from Ohio. I paid 10,000.00 on crowns onlays. My front 6 teeth have had care done by a female doctor who is on maternity leave. Since then everthing has gone bad. They said my bite wasn't right and thats why the crowns were coming of. They filed the back of my crowns several times and now they hurt and are sensitive to everything. I was told by one of the dentist that the lab was the issue but corporate made them use them. I have seen 4 different dentist all with a diffetent thought why my teeth hurt they ground down the back of crowns as well as my natural lower teeth. I also, have 2 other patients file papers with insurance information and phone numbers and addresses.  What happened to the hippa?  If my teeth don't get redone properly I will have no other resource but to go the hard way. I have pictures of ants crawling on counters were they were mixing materials and a bathroom that was such a mess in the early am.< /review>

This is by far the worst worst dentist office on the planet ,i was there yesterday my appointment was at 11:00 at 12:00 i got out of my chair and I said what is going on I have to go work in one hour they said wait 10 minutes I waited 15 minutes no body came by so I told i have to leave they said can you come back Saturday . the only and only reason I have to go back is because they did a new set of dentures for me and it,s the worst ,so if they don,t do it right I will call my insurance and tell them  not to pay them and I hope the insurance will listen to me.I recommend very very very strongly to everybody to avoid  this location, if there is rating below ONE star that will be my rating.<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) This is the worst place to go for your dental health, do not go here, you are only going to waste your time and your money is stolen and they ruin your credit. Bored of calling me and charging me for something they didn't do to me and all the staff there are very despotic and don't pay attention to you and when you ask to speak to a manager they tell you that they are not there and they leave a message and they don't call you back I repeat don't use western dental do not work 🤬

(Original)
Este es el peor lugar para ir por tu salud dental  no vallan acá solo vas a perder tu tiempo y tú dinero te roban  y te arruinan el crédito te cobran y no te hacen nada  yo fui y no me hicieron nada y me están cobrando  me tiene aburrida de llamarme y cobrarme por algo que no me hicieron  y todo el personal de allí es bien déspota y no te ponen atención y al pedir hablar con un manager te dicen que no está y dejan mensaje y tampoco te llaman de regreso  repito no usen western  dental  no sirven 🤬< /review>< Pictures>

Alerta! Recomiendo a los pacientes leer buen su poliza porque de esa forma están conscientes de los pagos que esta gente cobra...asisti a una cita y me estaban dando precios altos que no coincidían con mi poliza les insiste que deacuerdo a mi poliza eso era muy alto y ella seguia insistiendo que esos eran los pagos y ofreciendo financiamiento ante mi cara de asombre e insistencia la mujer luego me dijo "mira si tienes razon segun to poliza no tendrias que pagar nada"..me querían cobrar 240.00 dólares por un servicio que según mi poliza lo cubre el 100% es decir no tendría que pagar nada...  inmediatamente llame a mi aseguranza para dejarles saber lo sucedido.
Mucho cuidado con este lugar.< /Review></record>

<Review>My favorite bakery in town!!!!! Cheap price for all their item and love their fruit cake. You can always customize the cake just to send them a photo. Got a huge portion of my cake for under $100. Highly recommended this store for whoever love bakery items! Will definitely come back again and please stay in business forever!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr1hNUdBfClq_sF3hVcDXn-8vXHu3ptV-JAGc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYSUAP8ZOg-nu73dV4hJOvckJnmijyXW7razo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcseT5Vuzx6iDFajZFlcr3gVast6ApSme_OX4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnDNpjgCDdaYrcozAr-LFiK7uxH0p03IeMEII=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNko-6YIdF5nnuWfy-hHzsRDRZIcRaqTvbgaqU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM19C2ANYSLXtyC1JoZByKsPewMBvDcXMHzBis=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRAfvHovpJcz7twj7XIYK1MTqeGuJLR9wVkJ8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCELl10WCrS4JGf2Kyz1zDpPjvXLu6Qp0ZjlI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdeB-_zQz1G-HMgCHP64ewk7rYP7xoC4L2MLQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYQzbg0EmG93upsa12tSDVAzDAJVPl5ailAsA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXNfzM_x6WjrMcKjUYXZm_dzYJ-nORL_j7WfA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr7MaM0pdQapgAb_E4uEs4WdQ99Aq64lgK2bM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNW1sYr3r9Ms0ZoK8vaFMgg3eJg5EHIjuT-otk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoKgCcLq6StHfMmiGKa8UuKPY0TEgyTByTuII=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIGJSqvQtYeb9akh2epLb3Xr1zAe_uV3Thutk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN87F--uagqXzGjzESxd3TvtTnmqkeTxsFdxIU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoHosZu4p4Iod2ppIyQJYDjrAPlD8sZAZS4q4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJ85J11zOoR3lbMKBz2z2BHGI1kuDNDUZLtC4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQ8ExZcNIs4mn_Xx0lAnekDTwINV4E-oLOq3U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9Cj4jGufgBNNdYzzuLZDAvXPU2ut5iaUrG6M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6KYbmx9oI0cMmMxSYrm3eNeDIE7x-e-7MDec=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl13pkPOeFq8Z9o30K4tu0UfAYv5bSzA4oleU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUe0WsGm8lYh_n3nqmJdXdkdFJcT6ChZZrKUk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6qCv_6PBSGL5bDV83G37ltpRB22eifDJsx80=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHeTpTifEypAaHE8Q8kpQTWvZCsA8Fb-MDkU0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>First time at this place! I probably came too early and they were just setting out the pastries... Alsa I didn't have much to choose from. I grabbed a few random ones and thought I try a Crepe! It was surprising to see a ham crepe.. Definitely not gonna try that..(yet)! I settled on Strawberry ice cream crepe!! It was so good but not enough ice cream! And a tad bit too many diced strawberries fruit! Some fruits were sour! But that goes really well with the sweet strawberry ice cream flavour!</Text><GmapID>0x809ac56efcc922bb:0x6bf4bca4b39eba1a<//GmapID>< date>

Cafe food and the setting at this location is excellent. Visited about four, it was not full. Looking forward to returning with my relatives. Bring your hunger - portions are large. Reminds me of a place in New York I liked to visit.</review>

<review>Nice convenient Bakery. I go there for the pork baos. I've tried a few other things but I seem to like the pork sounds the best. I love it they have a point system available to offer me free goodies. I also like the day have sales and offer me get e on line through text messages. I'll be interested in trying one of their drinks or a sandwich or even a cake</review>< pics>

There are a lot of different pastries here.  I've only been able to try about 10% of the items and they've been really tasty. Pineapple bun is my favorite so far but the egg custards are also yummy. There are also egg waffles and Hong Kong milk tea here. This is a good place to grab a quick snack in the morning before taking on your day.</Text>

Clean, neat, friendly staff. I was very excited when I read Jeff's review. I like Hong Kong style milk tea ( rich and smooth tea with evaporated milk)  a lot. I paid $3.60 large. I am Disappointed because it is not even close to the fake stuff From VITA hk style milk tea . Which cost around $3 for 6 pack. I would not recommend hk style tea from this place. I wouldn't be mad if they take this item off the menu for the fact that it is not good at all. Sad.< /Text>

<text>I have been waiting for almost a decade for a Hong Kong style bakery to open up in Sacramento.  When I first moved to Sac, I tried ABC Bakery and it had some good staples, but it wasn’t quite enough for me.

Now you might be thinking, what’s a Hong Kong Style Bakery; this genre is nothing ground breaking but having grown up on this stuff, there are some definite classics: 1) Hong Kong Style Milk Tea, 2) cocktail bun, 3) red bean bun, 4) Taro bun, 5) egg tarts, 6) HK style Swiss roll.  I think they do a great job with these items.  I tried the chicken pie which they also made well.  It brought back a lot memories with some buttery goodness.

You know what, it wasn’t a whole paycheck like a nearby bakery (both have their merits but dollar for dollar, I think the value is here).  I wasn’t able to try their breakfast combo this time around but it’s on the list.  I think they did a good job rounding out their menu with some dessert and lunch items too.  Another review mentioned about kicking you out if you don’t buy something, and I think that’s pretty normal (esp by south sac standards), no loitering.  Keep up the great work Pegasus.  I hope you’ll be around for my grandkids to experience.< /text>< pictures>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>(Translated by Google) The waiter at Little Pegasus Bakery on 65th Street across from SF Express was too bad. I just visited the shop and bought a pandan cake and other breads. I returned to the car and wanted to eat, but my hands were dirty. I walked into the shop again and asked the waiter to give me one. Hand in knife? The waiter even told me that the charge was fifty cents apiece, and such a vampire shop would not buy it in the future.

65街顺丰对面的小飞马面包店服务员太差了，刚刚光顾店里买了一条班兰蛋糕还有其它面包回到车上想食，但手脏，再次走进店问服务员可以给我一个交刀吗？服务员竟然对我说收费五毛钱一个，这样的吸血鬼店以后都不去买了。<//Text>< user_name>

Even if it is cold, take it home and warm it up, but it is delicious. The only drawback is that the milk tea there is really not very good, at least not as good as the regular milk tea shop, so it is not recommended to buy it. But you can still buy it if you want to try it. There are also egg waffles and waffles, many types.

还不错的店，里面面包的种类很多，而且新鞋出炉的很好吃。即使冷了带回家热一下也很好吃。唯一的缺点就是那里的奶茶的确不怎么好，起码比不上那种正规的奶茶店，所以不推介买。但想尝试的还是可以去买的。里面还有鸡蛋仔和华夫饼，种类很多。< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Not a good place to walk through if you want to go fast. It's super crowded and I don't plan on joining a Christian fellowship today either.</review>

<Date>1582496492681</Date><rate>5</rate><text>Can't believe the dummies who give it a 1, 2 or 3 star reviews with comments like it's just a gate as in to keep cattle enclosed.  It's a piece of art.  The design and artwork are well worth taking a look at.  One also has to remember this was originally the backside of the campus.  The main gate is on North Side.  And then let's not forget the history that took place here.  From students being sprayed with tear gas by then Governor Regan, the equal rights protests and the national guard with guns.

Next time you pass through the gate, stop and take a look at the design and artwork.  Then do a bit of historical research to learn what's happened in the shadow of the gate.  The world you live in today was greatly influenced by what happened here.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>0 stars as a gate... it doesn't even close! I mean if Stanford tries to attack us we will have no defenses!
4 stars because it is a great spot to look into Strawberry creek or out across the beautiful campus that is UC Berkeley.
5 stars because someone dressed as Spider man climbed it and sat on one. of the towers during Halloween.<//review>< pics>

What the University of Carlifornia must consider doing is to reconstruct the Sather Gate into a more notable landmark. It was too small for my liking though<//Review>

<Review>It's a gate. It's really not that exciting. Plus you're very likely to get harassed with flyers by the organizations tabling on Sproul. Also if you're a tourist trying to take pictures in front of it, there are usually hordes of students trying to walk through it at all times to get to class or go home.</Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) A typical gate at Berkeley School. It is also the place where Masayoshi Son passed through this gate and dreamed. As a student, I would like to go through this gate someday.

The quality of the food was beyond reproach. Taste and presentation of food couldn't have been better. Food temperature was HOT and freshly made. Will definitely return. Kudos to the chef..Jukebox with authentic Mexican music was a great touch.< /Text>

<Text>Man this place has forever been my favorite taqueria.  They always make the meat dreshly cooked as you order not like the place next door where they have meat in trays that are cooked in the mornings.  I'll highly recommend this place to any of my friends and family 👪.  No Regrets.</Text>< Pictures>

Good food. "Almost" like home.  Prices are fair. They do serve just enough food that you're full and not wishing for more.... Good enough to eat everything! Service is personable and pleasant. Homemade corn tortillas are a plus of course! Keep up the great work people! Be seeing you soon! :-)< /text>

I had to ask for a carne azada sope.  It was the worst thing you could eat.  Never ask for a sope.  The carne asada was old and and it was like soak on oil to make it like it was fresh.  The tacos in general are good.  But don't ask for anything else.< /Text>< rate>

(Translated by Google) THIS PLACE ALREADY ENDED WITH THE HISTORY
THE ONLY RECOMMENDED IT IS LAA TORTILLOTAS MADE AMANO
WITH SOMETIMES SUNDAYS THAT CERTAINLY IS WHEN MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING
AND IT IS THE MOST SOLD
AND NOTHING MORE
THE REST OF THE FOOD
THIS MISTAKE AND VERY BAD MADE
NOTHING TO SEE
YEARS AGO THAT WAS ALL BETTER
CURRENTLY THE FOOD IS NOT GOOD TODAY
I DO NOT KNOW THE REASON
BUT DO NOT EFFORT TO SERVE WELL
AND GIVING THE BEST TO THE CUSTOMER
AND IT MAKES ME EXPENSIVE FOR SO LITTLE AND SO BAD

(Original)
ESTE LUGAR YA TERMINO CON LA HISTORIA
LO UNICO RECOMENDABLE ES LAA TORTILLOTAS HECHAS AMANO
CON MENUDO LOS DOMINGOS QUE POR CIERTO ES CUANDO VA MAS GENTE
Y ES LO MAS VENDIDO
Y NADA MAS
EL RESTO DE LA COMIDA
ESTA MALISIMA Y MUY MAL HECHA
NADA QUE VER
AÑOS ATRAS QUE ESTABA TODO MEJOR
HOY ACTUALMENTE NO ESTA BUENA LA COMIDA
NO SE LA RAZON
PERO NO SE ESFUERZAN POR  SERVIR BIEN
Y DAR LO MEJOR AL CLIENTE
Y SE ME HACE CARO PARA TAN POCO Y TAN MALO</Text>

<review>Dave is outstanding. I needed a replacement front wheel for my road bike which seemed like a very simple task however two other SB bike shops didn’t see the profit margin in it. Dave got me a new wheel easily within one day. Highly recommended!<//review>< GmapID>

Called a large place in town about a chain repair, said it would take a couple weeks to get me in. Called the guys at Fastrack and they had me in and out in 10 min. Great service highly recommended< /Review>

<review>It was local and easy to bike to. Luke was quick and helpful with a small bike repair I wanted done on my bike chain. Only took 20 minutes and was an affordable repair.

Dave is great!  I called him about a new SRAM cassette that just came out and he ordered it and installed in on my bike within 2 days.  He did the work in an hour and his labor charge was extremely fair.  He also improved my bike fit at no extra charge.  This place is a "find" and he has another loyal customer.</text>

< Review>
My aunt received 2 gift cards for having spent several hundred dollars there recently, and during her most recent trip to Fastrack , she forgot to use them (there was a big sale that day and she got flustered by the crowd and long lines). I thought I would try bringing in her receipts and the gift cards to see if I could fix it for her.< /Review>

<text>These guys are awesome! I had a tire and seat stolen off my ten year old bike and brought it in to get it fixed up. I don't ride much so I just wanted enough to ride it again. They immediately went through what they had, found the parts I needed and installed them for me. I was out the door in half an hour. Extremely happy<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>This one is easy!!!   Dave and his partner take care of you.  They go way out of the way to help you and at no charge sometimes.   The knowledge is there with the best of any bike shop.   The best part is that Dave gets it that you want your bike back sooner then later.   They work at meeting your schedule.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This shop is one of the best that I've ever visited and I've seen a lot of shops in my day (just trust me on that one). The owner, Dave, knows his stuff inside and out. He's an amazing mechanic himself, but has his trusty sidekick Luke there in case they need four hands on a job. It's the kind of shop where, once you know Dave, you can just go in and sit down and shoot the $hi% for hours on end... if you like that sort of thing. Great selection of stuff, not a stuffy haughty atmosphere. Yup, this really is a great shop.

I'm really sorry that there are one star reviews of this shop here on Google. Truly, this is a great shop and worth the visit if nothing more than to see the cycling museum-worthy paraphernalia.</Text>

I recently moved to Santa Barbara and went to Fastrack to get all of my gear, bike set up and get into the world of cycling. The guys at the shop were very knowledgeable, were able to help me out and get me set up with everything I needed. If you ever have an issue you can go back to them and they will help you however they can and are great with customer support. I would highly recommend this shop to anyone that is looking for a good shop to go to. I think some of the other reviews are out dated and this shop is far better than they make it out to be. Excellent bikes, parts, people, and service.

Check them out!<//Text>

I got a bike as a gift and was having some issues with dialing it in. The reviews said this was one of the best shops in town but they also were high end. I am a newbie and was a bit concerned walking into a specialty shop like this.

Dave (owner) grabbed my bike and my cell phone and told me he knows exactly what to do. I came back the next day and my bike was ready to go and Dave took his time to explain to me what he did. Here I am a $50.00 customer getting the $10,000 bike treatment that one would expect from a shop like this. He not only took the time to explain what he did but he answered some new rider questions and did not try to sell me anything. Just solid service, solid advice and a great understanding of road bikes. Everything small business is about. Give em a visit they have all ranges of bikes and the knowledge and know how to get you riding tight.< /Review>

Best staff in town. Came in with questions about how to fix my flat on my first tubeless tire. Didn't try to over-sell me, showed me how to fix it myself and left with the appropriately sized product. Always coming back here.< /Review>

A little frustrated. I went in to ask if I could buy a new visor for my bontrager helmet and was told that it would be "near impossible" to find. I went home and did a google search and found the exact part I needed on the Trek website! Obviously it wasn't impossible to find if I could order it directly from Trek. I could understand if it wasn't in stock at the store, but considering I'll likely have to pick the part up at the store anyway, it would've been nice to at least have been guided in the right direction.<//Text>

I just purchased a new bike from here. I am a daily commuter and use the bike to get to school, work and to a from the bus.

I had a great experience Luke and Dave are awesome. They helped me pick out the right bike and got it tuned up. If I ever want another bike in the future or need help with mine, I won't go anywhere else.< /Text>

<text>I was in Santa Barbara taking my son to college at UCSB.  He does not cycle much but needs a bike to commute. We saw the junk at KMart and some pretty expensive new stuff but one call to the owner and on a Sunday no less we were totally hooked up.  He had a perfect used older 'mountain' bike for a great price.  This is a great place if you like excellent customer service and a friendly and knowledgeable salesperson. We got lucky that he helped us on such a short notice and if/when we need another we will contact them right away.  We were there 9-24-2017 on Sunday.

This is by far the BEST place I have ever been to to get waxed.  The staff are all so friendly and the studio vibe is easy going and relaxed. They have me in and out in very little time and they follow Covid-19 protocol easily.  I have been coming here for 2 years, and I have been waxed by most of the staff.  I can't say enough about this place!!  Easy, Fun, Professional!!  So happy to feel normal again after a long 2020!!<//text>

Every technician there is friendly and knowledgeable.  Their scheduling system makes it easy to schedule or adjust appointments. I've been more then satisfied for every tanning and wax service I've had done.< /review>

I have never left this place crying but today. I definitely did. I use to love this place because I have really sensitive skin and their wax is gentle on my skin. I would drive from Los Angeles for 2 hours to San Diego just to use them. However, after my last experience I really understand the person makes the difference. My service was booked with Viviana. Not by choice but I selected the next person available.  I was running late as halfway to San Diego there was a deadly car crash that blocked the I-5 for 45 minutes. I called the location and informed them of what was going on, they said no problem just know  some of your services (bigger services such as legs) would not be able to fit into your appointment time.  I  had no issue with that as I understood I was the one running late.  Upon my arrival I was told the appointment was canceled as I took too long (even though I still had 35 minutes remaining on my appointment time, a 5 minute underarm service could of still been provided)  and their was another client coming. And Under normal circumstances they only wait 5 minutes.... Why would that not be mentioned on the phone when I specifically said I was driving from LA and their had been an accident? I could of saved my headache, gas, 3 hours on the road and just turned around and gone home. That’s not the worst part. The worst part is, I was sent a link to rebook my appointment. I click the link and it offers me to rebook my 5 minutes underarm waxing at 4:40PM (20 minutes before they close).  I booked it, was sent a  confirmation text, and email,  so I waited in my car. At 4:32PM I walked up to the door,  and it was locked. Viviana was inside but was yelling through the door. After a while of seeing I couldn’t hear her she came to the door to inform me they are closed, she clocked out already and so that’s that. I told her I had an appointment for 4:40PM and thought don’t close until 5PM she told me that’s not true because there was nothing in the computer saying I have an appointment. And she clocked out so.....  I showed her my confirmation. She said again “well I clocked out already”. I asked her if I could use the bathroom and I would just leave after that and head back to L.A. she told me No as once again “she clocked out already” and was the only person there.  I’m not understanding how after  driving 3 hours. Something as simple as “may I at least pee in your toilet?” Gets a “I clocked out” and the store is still technically open for another 24 minutes.  I assume it’s personal. Maybe my being black was an issue as I’ve never met this woman in my life to be treated like a liar and  like I was the one who had done something wrong when I was simply following a link they sent. I’ve never been treated like I was doing something wrong by asking to use the bathroom in a location where I would be a paying customer. I did not expect any major favors after my 3 hour road trip, but I at least expected that if they asked me to rebook they would honor that rebooking. If the computer is wrong then they need to update their system instead of confirming appointments for the client then claiming to be clocked out when you get there.<//text>

<Date>1580273712546<//Date><Review>I got in on a next day appointment - their system
Is very easy to use and book with. I ended up having to change times last minute and they were very accommodating.

My actual wax was with Bree. She was very sweet, asked questions about my previous wax experiences, and she was fast (which I like- it somehow hurts less).

I only took away a star because it was too fast - and when you’re that fast, you’re not very thorough. I felt a little rushed, and there were some areas she could’ve taken more time on. But it’s an appointment based business so I get it- the more appointments you get the more money you get. I would definitely go back but I just know what to expect.

Heads up- they use a combination of hard wax and soft wax. Soft wax strips that top layer of skin causing some sensitivity. Just so you know.<//Review><GmapID>0x80d9544c21542899:0x2f09c5a8d697c788<//GmapID>< pictures>

Based on the reviews I’m sure it would have been a better experience but unfortunately they cancelled on ME last minute after I booked an appointment a day in advance. On top of the confusion I got an email saying my appointment was 20 min later than what I set. Probably won’t try this place again<//Text>

Nice ladies, parking is right infront of the establishment so just because they’re using the parking lot to do services due to COVID-19, it doesn’t take away from parking<//text>

<text>I was fully expecting to love this place after reading the reviews but my actual experience was lack luster. I scheduled a French bikini wax and face wax. After the waxer completed my face wax, I noticed that my sideburns were uneven and I had stray hairs left on my face. I immediately asked to use her tweezers to remove the stray hairs and I asked her to make my sideburns even. It took 2 attempts to even out my sideburns which left them shorter than desired. She kindly filled in my eyebrows after waxing them which I appreciated, but when I got home and removed the make up, I noticed stray hairs that I needed to clean up. I was mostly satisfied with my French bikini wax. My only complaint is that the top wasn't waxed in a straight line. My remaining hair is a bit slanted and oddly rounded at the top. I will say that the staff are friendly and professional. However, in my opinion, the outcome of the services and the experience did not align with the price point or my expectations. Unrelated to the service, the parking situation is a bit difficult to maneuver. Beware when entering the parking area or exiting, you may have to reverse to make room for a car coming toward you in the opposite direction.< /text>< name>

My favorite place! Sabrina is so sweet and really gentle. My skin is very sensitive and she never fails to treat me right. I’ve been following her for years and won’t see anyone else. Her listening and communication is key she makes sure I understand what is being done and the expected result. I always recommend her to my friends and coworkers and some have even became regulars like myself. My advice book with her asap before she schedule packs up!!!<//Text>

<text>Cute wax bar located in Normal Heights/ Kensington. I usually get me waxes done by Bree and she’s amazing! Appointments are always very prompt. She does a great job and it’s as painless as possible. She’s always a good conversation to take your mind off the waxing and makes sure to get rid of any stragglers. Bonus, she has a good show playing in the background!< /text>< pictures>

<text>I visited this cute little wax bar one day after work - which means they already get points for being open past the typical 5PM. Ya girl is a beauty but without a wax, I can be a beast... I was serviced by a very lovely lady, Viviana, who was so personable but better yet - knowledgeable about her field and products. She was careful and comforting and I definitely recommend you ask for her the next time you visit!</text><user_name>Marguerite Dao<//user_name>< rating>

<gmapID>0x80d9544c21542899:0x2f09c5a8d697c788< /gmapID><Name>Erika Munante</Name><text>Recently new to San Diego and I was on the hunt for a waxing studio. I am a travel nurse and have to find new waxing studios in every state I go to. With so many options I happened to come across this gem. This was the FIRST and ONLY place I tried. I booked my first visit with Angie for a Brazilian. I waited several days to see my results. I was so pleased that I went back in shortly after for my underarms. My appointment went smooth. I walked in, was greeted right away, offered a beverage, and waited only a few minutes until Angie came out. Angie is a really sweet and professional esthetician! She made me feel comfortable, answered all my questions, and even gave me some helpful tips. Being a nurse, I always watch for the cleanliness of the esthetician and facility. Angie exceeded my expectations, she changed her gloves, never double dipped, and went from clean to dirty areas without cross contaminating. I am really glad I found this waxing studio. They offer an awesome monthly membership for Brazilians, which I highly recommend!<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

<Review>I had an awesome experience with Sabrina! I’ve been waxing for a while now and have had many waxers over the years but none of them were as quick and thorough as her. She was also very sweet and friendly which made me feel very comfortable. Needless to say, I will definitely be returning!<//Review>< user>

I love coming here, not only because it is close to where I live. But the girls there are GREAT. I go to get waxed by Rachel, n she's amazing as it is. Very professional n funny at the same time. She definitely helps remove the first time jitters n after that it's smooth sailing. I highly recommend coming to Elixr Wax Bar!.</Text>

I've been a loyal client every month since 2013 (it has gone thru a few name changes since then lol), and I would NEVER go anywhere else.  Hands down, this is the best wax boutique in the county.  I think I first found them (then 'Wax in the City') on Yelp - and was very impressed by the reviews, so decided to check it out.  The boutique is so cute.  The girls are the sweetest, most friendly people - and I love my Angie!  This place is Clean, clean, clean!   The wax they use is top of the line, and they use different types of wax on different parts - so they obviously know what they're doing.  And in all the years I have been going, I have Never seen anyone Double Dip!  Don't cancel last minute/no-show - it'll cost you!  These girls rely on their appointments, and they fill up quickly... I think walk-ins might have a tough time, because this place is regularly booked solid (but that's what happens when you're the best).  Their booking website is really easy to use, and you can make any changes to your appointment.  Hey!  If you're a student, you can get a special discount on Thursdays - I love that!  I have never been to their downtown location - but Angie only works at Normal Heights, so that's where I go.  I hear it's really nice, though.
Go. Ask for Angie. You won't be disappointed.<//Text>

Trisha was very quick when working with hot and cold wax on my bikini + leg areas. She also kept a nice conversation going which provided a welcome distraction for a rather newbie waxer gal like myself. Good experience overall!</Text>

They do a good job however, I never seem to see the person I schedule with. I'm not a fan of surprises, at least let me know in advance that the person I'm scheduled with will not be in do I can decide to reschedule or not instead of arriving to get the surprise.</Review>

I came to Lush via groupon and haven't left! I go to Angie and rebook my appointments while I'm there to get the $10 discount. Definitely try it out! Clean place and professional staff!< /Review>

< Review>
They get the job done, so I'll give them credit for that

However, customer service needs a lot of work

For example, the receptionist demanded that I wait inside starting 10 minutes before my appointment or they would cancel. This is absolutely ridiculous considering the situation with COVID,  and there was no reason I couldn't wait outside. This is in addition to the fact that they made me wait more than 30 minutes after my appointment time to actually be seen.

Dr. Carey is alright, but not the friendliest person.

If you go here you need to make sure you're very aggressive about being seen, or they will waste a lot of your time, really unprofessional.< /Review>

{'time': 1612822586073, 'text': 'Hello Saketh, We are sorry to hear about your recent experience at our business.  You are correct, you should not have to wait inside the office especially during COVID, nor should you have to wait extensively for the doctor.  Since your visit over the past summer many of our office policies and protocols have changed.  Currently, we  have patients to wait in their car and call/text when they arrive and we call them up when we are ready for their exam to begin.  Because we have so many protocols on social distancing, disinfecting, and schedule blocking - there is still some wait for the providers but we are continuously working to improve it. We hope you give us the opportunity to serve you.'}<//resp>

<Time>1604540505150<//Time><review>Dr Carey is great doctor and he provides excellent service, however the ECSV clinic has the most terrible billing department that I've even seen.
I've spent 6 months trying to figure out why my visit was claimed as "out-of-network" (I had 3 visits to ECSV this year, only one visit, the second, was marked as out-of-network, it's definetely some mistake), but I don't have an answer. My insurance told me that ECSV can't fill out a claim rightly, so it's marked as "out-of-netwrok". It looks like I'll pay the whole bill, just to save my time after 20+ calls to insurance and clinic.< /review>< username>

Shawn was my technician.  He was very professional.  Th staff at Carey Vision was very friendly from beginning to end.  They made me feel at home.  Dr Rutti was great.  Explained everything he was doing and made me feel very comfortable.  You can tell this place knows what they are doing.  Keep up the great work!</Text>

< review>
Six monthly checkup visit : received and started the routine tests and scans exactly on time. Then a long (30 minute) wait in an exam room before seeing the big doctor himself.
This is common experience with doctors in the area. One would think that the process could be better understood and handled better. Then a lot of professional people would waste less time.

I believe the quality of service and medical expertise at this office are well above average, and the office management is superlative. Everything apart from the wait is effective and efficient.<//review>

Highly recommend this clinic! Everyone is every professional and helpful. I was seen by Dr. Casey and Dr. Lally. The nurses where also very polite and competent. I am very grateful they accommodated my request to email me my results and notes as I'm an overseas visitor and would have to update my ophthalmologist back home. So happy I went to them!< /Text>

<text>Carey Vision Medical was a referal from my primary care physician.
The staff is very friendly, proffesional and helpful.  Dr. Carey communicates clearly, makes sound recommendations and is also very proffesional and friendly.  Appointments are flexible and they seem to be considerate of you time.  You can have your prescription processed right at the office and the frame prices are in line with what I have found at other eye wear stores.
I would recommend Carey Vision Medical.</text></record>

It is a good place to take the exam

A real professional Dr. In macular degeneration. People should see her to heal that problem.

I wish my left eye will be healed to have a good vision as my right eye.

Anyway, she is a devoted doctor.</review>

<review>Excellent doctors and care, but the ridiculous wait time makes it impossible to give them a higher score.  I’m always a few minutes early for my appointment, but have had to wait from 30-60 minutes passed my appointment time just to get started.  Then often wait another 20-30 minutes in an exam room before the doctor comes in.  This is not ok.< /review><rating>3<//rating><name>Barbara Lepiane< /name><Resp>None<//Resp>< user>

<text>Although I do trust Dr. Carrie with my I care very much, I cannot say that the experience was enjoyable;  simply because the building is not entirely acceptable for wheelchairs. I can see they're working on it though and look forward to my next visit in six months.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

I thought my appointment was at 10:30am but it was 11:30am, they took me in right away, so I was out of there before my regular appointment time. A big thumbs up for Dr. Lolly and her crue.< /Review>

< Review>
I have been a patient of Dr. Rutti for many years.  Now that he has joined Carey Vision, I still enjoy the same personal service and on-time appointments from qualified medical professionals and conscientious office staff.< /Review>

My appointment was at 10 am and I saw the doctor until 11:40 am! That’s ridiculous, almost two hours late... I had another appointment at 12:30 and I couldn’t make it, I basically lost all my morning waiting here. Really bad experience.< /Text>

<text>Absolutely in love with this place! Wonderful range of vegan and veggie options along with their regular menu. Adorable patio seating with some tables tucked away in lush plant life  It gives me a bit of a New Orleans/ French vibe as well even though they say old style cali feel.</text>< pics>

Food and service are always top notch. The back yard patio is dog friendly for outside diners. They'll also bring your pup a bowl of water when you ask. I love this place so much and wish I lived closer to it.
They are Covid-19 safe so please wear a mask when not eating and tip their hard working staff accordingly.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>Absolutely incredible food, perfect atmosphere, and wonderful service and staff. This was my first in person dining restaurant experience since the beginning of the pandemic, and I was completely blown away by how thoughtful and well-organized this place was. 10/10 would go back often. Also, I used the Yelp wait list and I highly recommend it! We were seated within 10mins of arriving.</Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<review>This place isn't too fancy, but the food is still awesome.   A shout out to all waiters that have been working hard to serve the food quickly.  The place was spacious and clean as well,  which is a great impact on me.   I love how organized they were. From the entrance, they were very welcoming.    It was a great place to dine in.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Hands down, one of the best restaurants in Ventura. Their outside patio is pet friendly- they even supply water bowls! I have to force myself to try a new dish every time I come because it’s too tempting to stick with one dish, and then I’m so happy because the new dish is always amazing...and then I want to order it the next time, lol. Heads up, they don’t take reservations for breakfast/lunch, just dinner, but you can do a same-day sign up on Yelp to put yourself on the wait list.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx5zK1WgOihiyYGED3kzITcLnONcJq4VQst1o0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIwczJagsSC7Y1G9sjmn6wut7RX2vA29BR5zZm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCeUWPkO1OAOHMrR_ayMmhE8b4SvD2pyQ8KBkk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80e9ace1d769e3e1:0x430ae333e970d2d4< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I love this joint. I’m not the only one because on weekends you can wait hours to get a table. Perfect brunch spot for a gathering of your girls or a meet up with family. Incredibly flavorful food, refreshing and delightful drinks & decadent desserts. Must try the Pablano Del Mar, Strawberry Hibiscus Mimosa and the finisher or starter, Maple Bacon Beignets. 😋<//Text>

<review>One of my go to breakfast places. They have an awesome ambiance, great COVID safety measures, super clean, and they have a beautiful patio. The service was good and the food was even better, their breakfast options are all super tasty and generous and I definitely recommend this place if you’re in the area. Definitely try the Green Tea Tiramisu pancakes, they’re so soft and delicious, they don’t even need syrup since they’re so good on their own. The Brunch Burger is massive and delicious, and the white chili is some of the best I’ve ever had!<//review>< pictures>

I am from out of town. I was drawn in by the maple bacon beignets for breakfast. The customer service was very kind and attentive. I received my order pretty quickly and I ate it in the car so I would be able to eat them fresh. They were just okay. The beinets were a bit tough and over cooked, but the maple syrup and bacon flavor was really sweet and smokey and helped moisten and season the dry beinet.</Review>

<review>An elegant dining experience! They had fresh truffles flown in the night I dined, so a few off hand dishes were offered. I'm glad I choose a pasta, as it was divine. Overall this is a lovely Restaurant, and the service was great and ambience was perfect. Still a lovely place to enjoy an evening. I highly recommend this restaurant for their exceptional service and food!</review>< Response>

This place is amazing! From COVID safety, friendly service, and amazing food! I don’t regret coming here at all. The chocolate french toast with my sweet banana strawberry and eggs benedict were cooked to perfection and best in town. Service was super friendly and fast. Clean, minimal, and relaxing. Will always come back here, thanks to all of you.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Café Nouveau was a wonderful breakfast surprise through and through. The service is very professional, yet friendly and welcoming. Strict covid protocols were observed, including temperature checks, which is a first for me in a restaurant and made me feel safe. The dishes, albeit traditional, have fantastic flavors with fresh ingredients. We were amazed by the beignets, biscuit and grave, and chorizo egg scramble. Café Nouveau was a great place to spend our Saturday morning and we will definitely stop by again when we are in the area!<//Text>< pics>

Amazing menu and superb service with a quaint atmosphere in Ventura.  They have a very well thought out setup to deal with the social distancing requirements.  Almost a Disney feel to the setup.  Owner made the rounds to every table checking on the customers.  We had breakfast,  and must say, start with the Maple-Bacon beignet. Absolutely wonderful!! Can't wait to try lunch and dinner menus.< /review>

Upon arriving in the area, the parking is across the street but limited in spaces. If needed, there is some street/neighborhood parking. Staff was accommodating for my large party of seven + one dog. We didn't wait too long for a table luckily and we're immediately seated away from other tables per Covid-19 precautions. Our server Hector was very funny and gave great suggestions of what to order. He served us to the best of his abilities and was wearing a mask as well as gloves to make sure we were comfortable dining here. I was not disappointed with each dish ordered from what Hector suggested. The eggs benevilla, the eggs Nouveau, the peanut butter bacon banana bacon french toast sandwich and the beignets were delicious. I hope to be back when I'm in the area again.</text>

Came to Ventura during a nice little COVID-break from Los Angeles to get away from all the craziness. During my time there I found this spot while I was exploring the city.

This is the second time I’ve come here for breakfast, and I love it! They have great customer service and despite how busy they are you generally don’t have to wait too long to get seated here.

Today my boyfriend and I split the s’mores pancakes (yum!) and I had the vegetable and pesto frittata while he had the Nouveau scramble, both were delicious! I highly recommend the frittata especially if you like pesto, and the pancakes were a perfect hit is nostalgia for s’mores with the roasted marshmallows on top.< /Text>

This cafeteria really has it all, and I'm thankful because their charges are just within my budget. The foods and any other beverages here are really good, and I could not ask for more about it. Everything was really tasty, and I'm thankful because I was greatly satisfied with the service. Thank you so much, guys! Keep it up!< /text>

<Text>Five Stars is an understatement... This place sets a new standard for breakfast/ brunch... The service is amazing, staff is professional, friendly, and gave great recommendations, food came out hot and fast, probably in less than 15 minutes (while they were packed on a Sunday morning). Can't go here without getting the beignets. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu... We loved the breakfast sandwich and benviella Benedict. We will absolutely be back</Text>< Time>

Best breakfast in Ventura County. A little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. The dishes are well worth the wait (always a little wait especially on the weekends) and the price. If you’re really hungry and feeling a little adventurous try the Peanut Butter Bacon Bananna French Toast Sandwich👌👌. You won’t be disappointed I promise.<//text>

I love going to this Restaurant! I have been many times, and the quality of the food is always excellent. I enjoyed the pear and rocket salad and the beef carpaccio. The staffs are nice, and the ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner. You may have little clue what you are eating without referring to the menu, but you really don't care because it's all so good!<//text>

< Review>
This place was absolutely adorable! What a lovely Gardner patio. Most importantly the food and service was outstanding. Must trys: maple bacon beignets- they weren't sickeningly sweet they were just right. We came on a Sunday at around 10 and waited for 25 mins to get in, I think that's quite reasonable. :)<//Review>

<text>Our favorite place for great food in Ventura.   We love the food, service and atmosphere.   This time for lunch I ordered the strawberry salad with balsamic / add chicken.  We are always greeted like family here.  They have a great selection of breakfast, lunch  and dinner items on there menu.  The restaurant is always decorated for the upcoming holidays, whatever it might be.< /text></record>

Came to Ventura during a nice little COVID-break from Los Angeles to get away from all the craziness. During my time there I found this spot while I was exploring the city. The had a great service, amazing food taste and quality, Staff were super fast and also helpful with some good suggestion that can make your day even more better.</text>

Cafe Nouveau has always offered patio dinning. We miss this place post Covid and decided to try the new way of Covid dinning! CN has put in very thoughtful measures - masks, gloves for the wait staff; the process of only certain staff will clear the used plates and flatware; the way to pay bills. They separated the tables, added aluminum shields to the screens that separated the tables. We were dining in private !! We felt safety measures were satisfactory to us.< /review>

They only offer patio seating right now due to governor's orders, but the patio is so nice. We got seated at a private section where we were surrounded by beautiful plants and flowers.</review>

I love this beautiful spot for delicious food and a really wonderful atmosphere. The owner and all who work there are such quality people.  The owner has done an excellent job complying with the extensive(exhaustive!) regulations to reopen. The outside seating area is now made into cozy seating areas protected from others. It continues to be a beautiful setting with luxurious plantings outside this lovely 1920s converted house. A delight!</text>

The bacon beignets were great, the pancakes dry, everything else absolutely delicious. The don't have alcohol though, which I found interesting. Not hard liquor at least. Although for some reason they have rice vodka.... it's kinda confusing.

The vibe of this place is just right though. Def recommend.< /Text>

Wait time was quick and we felt safe with temperature checks at the door. Nice use of technology for digital menus using QR codes, tablets for each server for quick order and checkout. Lovely outdoor seating is private, green, and happy. Our server was funny, helpful and attentive. I recommend the Frisco burger and the au gratin potatoes! Yum! Can't wait to go again.<//review>

Fabulous breakfast choices. Very New Orleans style food selections. Haven't tried lunch or dinner as of yet, but if its anything like the breakfast, its 5 star.
My last order was Bananas Foster malted waffle with rum butter sauce. Have to order the scalloped potatoes,  they are really good , as is everything else I have tried.
Prices are reasonable as well.< /Text>

We shared an order of bacon maple beignets
They were absolutely decadent! Lots of bacon crumbles, a good amount of maple syrup

I ordered the bacon, gorgonzola & caramelized onion frittata
It comes topped with diced tomatoes and arugula

The bacon flavor was more subtle than I'd prefer, the tomatoes and arugula added a nice, refreshing layer to the profile

My youngest daughter had chocolate brioche French toast
Pure decadence: a mountain of bananas, strawberries, and whipped cream, atop two slices of midnight dark French toast, a generous helping of nutella between them

Amazing flavor

My oldest daughter had the peanut butter, bacon, banana French toast sandwich
Two slices of Texas toast sized bread surrounded a dazzling mixture of PB, bacon, and bananas, and is served with a thick maple sauce

Incredible flavor

My dish came with a cornbread blueberry muffin
Different, but tasty, warmed, with butter

The check came with three miniature lemon poppy seed muffins with frosting and sprinkles
A delicious end to a great meal</text>

<review>I love this beautiful spot for delicious food and a really wonderful atmosphere. The owner and all who work there are such quality people.  The owner has done an excellent job complying with the extensive(exhaustive!) regulations to reopen. The outside seating area is now made into cozy seating areas protected from others. It continues to be a beautiful setting with luxurious plantings outside this lovely 1920s converted house. A delight!</review></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful experience for breakfast!  The restaurant has done a spectacular job, providing great food and perfect service all the whole maintaining an environment that is very clean and safe.  From temperature screening to shields around the tables (which only added to the ambiance), a very nice experience.  Oh, and did I mention how wonderful the food is?  Thanks Cafe Nouveau!!!</review>

My daughter and I drove to the Cafe Nouveau from Burbank when she came into town to visit, the last Saturday of January, 2020. We had other things to do in Ventura that day, but this place is one of my daughter's favorite places to eat. It has become one of mine also! Take it from me, the food is great. This was my 2nd time eating there with her. I had their Chile Verde Omelet for the 1st time and it was great!< /text>

Brunched here 2x in 3 days, and would have on Thanksgiving too if they were open.  Great brunch options from benedicts to beignets, and they manage their clientele and service super efficiently.  The go to place for breakfast in Ventura.</review>

- apart from the mandatory mask, your temperature gets checked before entering
- all menus are virtual (no sharing with previous guests)
- coffee refills are done by serving a new mug (no sharing of refill coffee pots with other guests)

Thank you for taking the pandemic seriously while trying to keep the business open and serving the customers! <3</review>< user_name>

Awesome breakfast with the Elvis French toast - bacon peanut butter bananas sandwiched between cloud like French Toast. Chorizo jalapeno omelets with white beans and sweet potato biscuits, OMG! #WorthTheDriveBreakfast< /Review>

The best all around restaurant in Ventura.  Breakfast lunch and dinner you can't go wrong.  The service is exceptional too.  Dinner and dessert never let's  down.  Tonight we had the black beast, flourless chocolate torte.< /Review>

Great food - a little pricey. Worth it for our anniversary breakfast. Love the beignets - not dry at all. Their house made syrup is amazing - very decadent. Great topper for pancakes,waffles or french toast. Ordered eggs benedict - delicious. Also had cinnamon raisin french toast - amazing!!! Service was attentive & friendly. Our temperatures were taken at the door quickly & efficiently. Lots of shrubs & climbers to help diners have privacy & feel cozy. Heaters kept the morning chill away.<//Text>

<review>Stopped in here for brunch while on a roadtrip and it was a great find! This place gets busy but it's worth the wait! The entire staff were so friendly and good to us. We got complimentary mini cupcakes, it was really cute.

The food was awesome, I tend to fill up quickly so I packed half of mine and it was just as delicious later on. The beignets were amazing! As soon as we saw they had them on the menu we knew we'd have to get an order. Thanks for the awesome experience!</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9vmkEHy5LWJ8TztgsHkgUcL_jHLXG0_Q5jObl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNc5faWyUyNkr7WbcWIwdLMEXKpI4rKxmQZEG7s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqXgnPgkDbaguXB-lMqA8-NwCPsUIeZhVYxiiz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

Our favorite place for great food in Ventura.   We love the food, service and atmosphere.   This time for lunch I ordered the strawberry salad with balsamic / add chicken.  We are always greeted like family here.  They have a great selection of breakfast, lunch  and dinner items on there menu.  The restaurant is always decorated for the upcoming holidays, whatever it might be.<//Review>

Cafe Nouveau has always offered patio dinning. We miss this place post Covid and decided to try the new way of Covid dinning! CN has put in very thoughtful measures - masks, gloves for the wait staff; the process of only certain staff will clear the used plates and flatware; the way to pay bills. They separated the tables, added aluminum shields to the screens that separated the tables. We were dining in private !! We felt safety measures were satisfactory to us.<//Text>

This place was absolutely adorable! What a lovely Gardner patio. Most importantly the food and service was outstanding. Must trys: maple bacon beignets- they weren't sickeningly sweet they were just right. We came on a Sunday at around 10 and waited for 25 mins to get in, I think that's quite reasonable. :)< /review>

I ordered the maple bacon beignets (delicious!!).  Salad was delicious, but I feel that the portions could be larger.  Green tea tiramisu was so so.  I couldn’t really taste the green tea.   Environment was quaint.</review>

"More of your cupcakes Carlos"!  Your food is so good - I just need my momma to share more of what's on her plate with me.  Your kitchen and you should be *** Michelin (is that good tires-I'm too young to know.)</review>

<review>We got sat inside to not wait for the outside seating.We had a large group, 11, and we only waited about 20 minutes. That shows that they have an efficient service! We had so many good things for breakfast. I suggest going with an appetite. The servings a re generous and the flavors are on point.I love the fact you can have a cup of coffee while you wait. Though parking can be limited, I suggest you come early and find a spot in their parking lot access the street.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>This restaurant is literally built in a house. It's super charming and they definitely embrace the New Orleans vibe.
Our group had a variety of things; The s'mores pancakes - SUPER sweet so I'd recommend splitting then unless you want to experience a huge sugar crash. The Poblano Del Mar - delicious but it's a lot for one person to take down - The rice was well seasoned, the pepper was well-cooked and wasn't mushy and the seafood and veggies meshed well with the entire dish. The one dish that was a little lackluster were the chocolate waffles - instead of having the chocolate chips mixed into the batter, they were out on top and therefore ended up burnt. So the waffle was really a plain waffle with burnt chocolate pieces, which was... Not great and went unfinished.

Overall though, yummy food, great service and a pretty short wait considering how busy it is.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0Rs9w2nubXuIf58BpWUotplfYVOPxufdQkTiA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipME9nlju1v1nzLXzutS1LdtZrK3BKEAgQrJ9xfA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80e9ace1d769e3e1:0x430ae333e970d2d4</GmapID></record>

<resp>None< /resp><review>Delicious and worth it! Been there for breakfast multiple times, they do serve lunch and dinner. Had their Benedict, omelettes, seasonal breakfast menu, left full and satisfied. Go for their bake goods, toast you can get anywhere. Very attentive staff. Options to sit inside or in their patio. It can get busy, so try not to loiter after eating, it is very cozy and charming not too. Parking is available across the street, and in the neighborhood.<//review><userid>109160354616725142690< /userid><gmapID>0x80e9ace1d769e3e1:0x430ae333e970d2d4< /gmapID>< rate>

Love this place for dinner.  I often  forget about this quirky little joint and when I return,  like last night,  we all smack our heads and ask "what took us so long?"  The food is worthy of a special occasion and the prices are so reasonable.   The wine list is great too. Go!</Text>

Quaint converted home. Small Dining areas are all rooms in the home. Lots of outdoor seating. I've only gone on Fridays and it's always busy. Food is good and good variety. Service is attentive. I really like this place.< /text>

What a wonderful place. The food is delicious. It's always so busy so I never get to go. There patio is there best if you want to wait even longer. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. The service is great! The parking is literally half the battle of this place. If you don't mind walking and waiting this is the place for you!;<//review>

<Review>I came here on a Tuesday morning, so there was no wait to be seated inside. Perfect little bungalow with garden views even! I couldn't believe they had matcha tiramisu pancakes, it was delish and not too sweet! Also got the Italian sausage and eggs with the au gratin potatoes and sweet potato biscuit. Like what in the world it was all so good! Service was great, very nice and made me wanna tip well!<//Review>< user_name>

<text>I absolutely loved every dish we had!! Cannot wait to come back and try more!!! Top 3 breakfast places I have ever had!! Very beautiful place! Their food was good but I really didn't like their hollandaise sauce, it tasted like there was maybe cherry and orange in it? I'm not even sure what the taste was. The pancakes were great and we ordered a couple different kinds!<//text><userid>106125903041273017526</userid><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

What a great place to have a nice lunch. They are open for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner but use care on your arrival because they close mid afternoon. The setting is wonderful with a garden setting and Spanish home and well maintained. Portions are generous and everything is great. You must have the Beignets here, you will come back for them alone. Great menu choice's, service was prompt and came back several times to see if we needed anything.</review>

The long morning lines moves quickly but greatly eased by the complimentary coffee,  hot apple cider, and tasty jalapeno strawberry lemonade. Overall,  great spot. Oh, def try the beignets! Best when shared.< /review>< Pictures>

If you choose to go on a weekend, don't be in a hurry; it gets very busy and the service can get slow . My guess is it's because the kitchen's a bit backed up, but man their food is amazing.
A lovely old house with eclectic decor< /text>< Pictures>

Lovely setting. Kind and caring staff. Delicious food. Amazing selection of unique cuisine. Miixed up our bill and a requested choice of sides but they were happy to make the adjustment. Definitely worth trying. Would visit again.< /review>

<Review>Omg. So good! There's always a wait and the food is all so delicious. Staff is really friendly and honest. Can't wait to try more things!</Review></record></dataset><record>
<text>Restaurant is located in an old house.  Seating is available both inside and out.  The atmosphere is quite nice.  The staff were very pleasant with warm smiles.  The breakfast menu is very extensive with selections of American and Mexican classics.  They have a very large pancake selection with various fruits and syrups available, eggs Benedict, waffles, etc.  They have Saratoga sparkling water available which is nice.  Visited here just after opening during the week.  I would imagine this place would get rather crowded on the weekends.  Two eggs and two strips of bacon were $5 and then pancakes were about $10.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes and there were plenty of blueberries. I saw some reviews mentioning dogs but I didn't see any during my visit. Recommended.</text>< rating>

We had breakfast here after spending the night in Ventura and I was blown away by this place. The beignets were the best and the service was impeccable. Your coffee was never empty and portions were just right. We'll be back the next time we're in the area for sure.< /Review>

<text>I love the food here! It's super tasty. Few things that aren't great though... No kids menu. Not a single kid friendly meal. And the sides are pretty expensive. One egg is $3.25. I mean come on. And not every menu has the specials, which you should definitely try!< /text>< Pics>

<text>Had dinner with my friends here a couple of nights ago. A quaint house which has been renovated into a restaurant. I had the green chicken enchiladas which were absolutely delicious. There is no parking which is a bit of a setback. I do recommend this place for brunch they have a very nice patio.<//text><Date>1550036018835</Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

Expansive brunch menu with standards and interesting items like an Eggs Benedict served atop a ranchero sauce drenched tamale instead of English muffin. It was excellent! Only negative was the house coffee cost $4... the priciest I recall seeing since eating in Tokyo.<//Text>

We really enjoyed our breakfast at Cafe Nouveau. The food was great, and the coffee was very good. Service was excellent, also. We were seated quickly, and the waitress was super friendly and helpful. The patio was perfect for enjoying our morning near the coast. I love restaurants like this that have converted an old home into a one of a kind location.<//Review>

It’s unique setting in an artfully re-purposed home is just the beginning of your enjoyment. Then comes the friendly and efficient staff and the great menu offering unique and delicious creations. The Brie Quesadilla blends brie cheese, apples, walnuts, and a maple syrup mustard drizzle for a delightfully different fusion of flavors. The reasonable prices mean you can make this a regular stop, yet its appealing setting and tasty menu choices make it the perfect choice for a special guest.<//Review></record>

<Review>It's my favorite place to get breakfast but everyone knows this place now and with all the tourists in town, the wait can be a pain on the weekends. The food is tasty and the service is top tier. It can be pricey depending on what you order but be prepared for a $45 bill for 2 not including tip.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Don’t drive right by! Nestled in its lush garden setting in a quiet Ventura neighborhood, you might miss Cafe Nouveaux. But seek it out. It’s unique setting in an artfully re-purposed home is just the beginning of your enjoyment. Then comes the friendly and efficient staff and the great menu offering unique and delicious creations. The Brie Quesadilla blends brie cheese, apples, walnuts, and a maple syrup mustard drizzle for a delightfully different fusion of flavors. The reasonable prices mean you can make this a regular stop, yet its appealing setting and tasty menu choices make it the perfect choice for a special guest.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80e9ace1d769e3e1:0x430ae333e970d2d4</gmap_id></record>

<Text>We started coming here 3 months ago when we first moved to Ventura. We were immediately hooked! So far everything we have ordered has been nothing short of perfect. They have the best maple bacon beignets that are to die for! They serve these incredible sweet potatoes biscuit or Blueberry muffin with almost all breakfast dishes.  This particular dish pictured is a pesto vegetable frittata.  Great flavor and loaded with zucchini,  onions ( not on mine however), mushrooms, smoked gouda and a seriously flavorful homemade pesto. The dishes however take second fiddle to the staff and owner. Will definitely remain one of our favorites ❤< /Text>< Response>

If I could think of my favorite reason to come to Ventura this should be the first place I’d go to and this would always be my answer.

Don’t be surprised if you have to wait 10 or 15 minutes after 9 o’clock because the whole town likes to come here… And why wouldn’t they? It’s fantastic!

I have to tell you the peanut butter and chocolate cake needs to be kept a secret because if I saw that and ordered it when I first arrived it would be all I eat LOL!

I went for the breakfast sandwich which is perfect the bun that serve done is nice and tender but does it get all sloppy and gross after a few minutes… It stayed delicious the whole time… And didn’t get a single stain on my white T-shirt.

If you like healthy salads look no further although I didn’t order the chicken salad the person I was with did it was almost so beautiful I hated seeing it be consumed LOL!

But let’s just say this the service is great I had so much fun it was like visiting a bunch of friends I hope I get to come back and see them all again!!<//Review>

Food was good but the waiter we had was very rushed, pushy and rude. Just visiting Ventura for the day. Patio was very pretty with all the plants and birds singing. Probably try somewhere else when we come back to visit. I would come back but want to try more cafes in Ventura.< /review>

This was my first visit but I'm in love. Everything we had was amazing, but my favorite was the coconut macadamia nut pancakes. They were so incredibly good. The caramel vanilla sauce they serve instead of syrup was a fun twist. Adorable place with indoor and outdoor seating. Pets aloud at the outdoor tables.</Review>

A converted house with a charming, indoor/outdoor garden environment. Very efficient, professional and friendly service and a menu with many delicious choices for breakfast, lunch or dinner. For the area it's a little bit pricier but a whole lot nicer.</Review>

CAFE NOUVEAU IN VENTURA CA IS A VERY UNIQUE RESTAURANT WITH A WARM AND COZY EUROPEAN FEEL TO IT. THE STAFFING WAS VERY FREINDLY AND EFFICIENT AND THE PLACE WAS EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAN WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I ALWAYS LOOK FOR IN A RESTAURANT. I HAD THE EGGS BENEDICT AND POTATOES WITH AVOCADO WHICH WERE VERY WELL PREPARED AND TASTEFUL. THEIR PRICES ARE COMPARABLE TO OTHER RESTAURANTS WITH LESSER SERVICE IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. THEY OPEN FROM 8 AM TO 2 PM AND THEY REOPEN AT 5 PM TILL 9 PM MOST OF THE WEEK. ONE WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED ONCE YOU TRY THEM.<//review>

<Text>They were very good about accommodating our large party of 9 on a Monday morning. Most of us had separate checks and that was no problem.  Good variety of food choices and everyone was pleased with their meal. Breakfast sandwich was a hit. I didn't really care for the sweet potato biscuit, a little dense for me. However, the regular biscuit looked nice & fluffy. Our meal was ended with complimentary mini cupcakes. Nice touch. The handicapped entrance was an ordeal. It was far from the front for someone with limited mobility.  Also, the handicapped bathroom is near the handicapped entrance so it seemed like a long walk from the dining area.  Everyone had a hard time parking so try to come in as few cars as possible.<//Text>< Pics>

A little pricey but yummy. The outdoor area was really nice to sit in on this sunny day. The celebration dessert was very thoughtful and plenty to share.<//Text>

Never disappoint! Always a warm greeting with the intent to get you and your party situated ASAP. Once you're seated that's where the fun begins! Too many food and drink options to choose from, all prepared and served with the upmost quality. If you haven't had the chance to eat here then I encourage you and your party to do so, However, if you're a regular like myself then you know what I'm talking about!<//Text>

First experience was so so. I tried the breakfast tamale because it came highly recommended by the staff and was 'soooo good'.  It was interesting, but I wouldn't order it again. The table was sticky and we had to ask them to clean it. The waitress was really nice and the service was good. We'll probably try it again.<//Review>

Too many choices to decide! That's the worst thing I can say about this place. And the choices! Oh my! Lots of unique, delicious options. The service was the best ever! I felt like every one was waiting on me, not only my waitress. My new favorite in Ventura.< /review>

We were passing through the area and stopped for breakfast. Best call of the trip so far! The food was excellent, I had the breakfast sandwich as a burrito and it was excellent. The staff are very friendly, attentive and helpful. We had a wonderful breakfast and will definitely be stopping here again.</text>

Beautiful ambiance. Friendly staff. Obviously well established with captive clientele. Vegans beware, not an adaptable menu or chef in my sole experience. Everything has meat and or dairy, no menu alternatives. Vegetarian menu has dairy. No reason to return.<//Text>

I found this place via a search for an "organic breakfast in Ventura." The atmosphere was great, the service rocked, the flavor profile was a great attempt.  But the more I eat fresh, locally grown organic food the more I can taste the substandard subtleties of conventionally farmed ingredients. There is a flatness to it. So my hope would be that they find local farmers and get better ingredients...because really amazing food starts there.<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Such delicious food. Plan on a wait, when you go for brunch, but it is worth it.

They have a unique fusion of Creole and Mexican food mixed with California freshness and focus. Eggs Benedict with a tamale? How about Eggs Benedict with a crab cake and spicy tomato remoulade sauce? Either way, it is all delicious.

Very efficient staff takes  good care of you and turns tables faster than you would expect. Highly recommended, just be ready to wait 10 to 30 minutes for a table.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures></record>

They were so delicious I had to keep from trying to finish them. I had a bold and flavorful creole eggs benedict. It was two poached eggs each on top of a crab cake on top of a biscuit. The hollandaise sauce was complimented with a spicy tomato sauce.

<review>Tried to go here for brunch this past Sunday morning. Put our name down for 2 and was told it was a 20 minute wait. No problem. Sit down right next to the door and sip on our coffee. After about 15 minutes we watch the 3-top that walked in the door with us get sat. Then we proceed to see a couple who just got done running walk in and be told it would be 5 minutes, and were promptly sat before us. 30 minutes go by since we put our name down, and we watch several groups of 2 and 3 who came in after us get sat before us. I go in to ask the kid working the list what was going on, and he tried to give me some canned response about larger groups and yada yada ya. Not buying it. 45 minutes after we put our name on the list, I told them to take it off and we went elsewhere. We won't be back either, which kinda sucks because the food is usually good, but we won't tolerate being treated like this.< /review>< pictures>

This place is a gem in a sea of mediocre. It is wonderful. Service great. Food choices extensive and delicious. What keeps me going back are the maple, bacon beignets. No one food has thrilled me more and I have had them in New Orleans. Parking really bad.</Review>

<Review>Favorite place to come for breakfast and lunch. The blueberry corn muffin is always a must tho!! Today we shared the Nouveau Garden omelette and the Breakfast Sandwich. Tried the hash browns and the (amazing) ah gratin potatoes. Everything was great as usual.

<Text>Warm and cozy atmosphere with a vintage home look. The employees were friendly and welcoming. Our server was fantastic had great recommendations which my sister and I ended up ordering from them. She had the delicious mouth watering upside down pineapple pancakes. They were so delicious I had to keep from trying to finish them. I had a bold and flavorful creole eggs benedict. It was two poached eggs each on top of a crab cake on top of a biscuit. The hollandaise sauce was complimented with a spicy tomato sauce. I strongly recommend this place for it's ambiance, the employees which are awesome and the delicious and different styles of breakfast<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Cafe Nouveau is one of a kind in every respect.

Excellent, inventive dishes with amazing ingredients that are fresh and full of flavor.

Exemplary hostessing and wonderful servers.

Casual comfortable, yet you feel in the interior section like you're somewhere out of the country, and at the garden area like you're in a tropical backyard.

The owner Carlos is so kind and humble. He and his wife have such creative minds in the kitchen - so many dishes are just excellent every time you order them.

For my wife and I, this is our #1 choice over all other restaurants in the region.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>Bad, bad, bad, actually worse
Used to be so good. Not sure what changed, but now the service is bad, the food tasteless.
We had 2 omelettes. The Mediterranean omelette had only traces of vegetables, but lots of cheap pizza tomato sauce. The garden omelette that my wife had included veggies but no flavor. The side salad that both of us requested instead of potatoes was just a pile of lettuce. We were however surprised to see that we were charged extra $1 each. They are supposed to tell you in advance.
Bottom line - we will not eat there again<//review>< pics>

A quaint French Creole flavored cafe provided a great way to start our weekend. Maple bacon beignets to start. Chocolate chip, almond and coconut pancakes with vanilla caramel syrup with a side of chicken apple sausage for me and a custom scramble for hubby! Large portions and cozy atmosphere or patio seating for a warmer time. Excellent service and large menu selection,.</text>

<review>Good service, and tasty food.  Choices are numerous and varied.  We've been there for breakfast in the past. This time we were having a lunch.  Most choices were $13-16.  Drinks were $4 each and any variation can also add to the bill.  With tax and 20% tip three of us had a $75 bill.  Kind of pricey for a lunch.<//review></record></dataset><record>

This place is delicious.  A upscale breakfast place that recently started doing dinner service.  The staff is beyond plesent and the food is never bad.  Also, they do great champagne mimosas.  Get here early on the weekends because there will be a line.< /Review>

Great atmosphere on the outside patio, surrounded by trees. Wait staff was fabulous as was the food. Relaxed brunch with family and even had the dog with us since we were outside.

Parking was across the street. I'm disabled but was still able to make the short walk across the street. Entered from the back patio instead of the front door to avoid the stairs. Staff was still there to greet us and ensure we were taken care of.

Definitely want to go back there again!< /text>

<rate>4<//rate><review>Excellent place for brunch, they have some really good dishes that are specific to Cafe Nouveau. Such as their vanilla maple syrup and their specials. They also have a pretty good omelette. There's usually a line after 8:30 and a very popular place for brunch on the weekends. It is street parking here only.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Incredible outdoor setting, consistent fast and friendly service and delicious food makes this a staple in Ventura. It is a must-try but it does get very busy, as it should so just be prepared for a little wait if going on the weekends.<//Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>Awesome Little place. Lots of character. Food was amazing. We ordered beignets the waiter informed us that he thought they were over choked so he made the kitchen remake them. That to me says pride in ones work. It looked like the menu was all breakfast which is what we were there for (at noon). If you haven't gone go. Only negative is us kind of hidden. It looks like someone's house. Just look for the giant sunflower. They have a new dedicated customer.<//Text><userid>110801731066321616443< /userid>< Rate>

Stopped by for brunch on a weekend trip from LA. Beignets are delicious!! Highly recommended. I got the eggs Benedict with crab, but the spicy sauce was really overpowering. Didn't taste much crab flavor. The regular eggs Benedict was delicious though, so I'll probably get something simpler next time!< /review>

Croquet Madame was the bomb!! If you have never tried this dish it is a French Bistro Standard in Paris; it's an upscale open faced grilled cheese with ham & egg with Mornay sauce. My girl had Frisco Burger was "Fabulous". Others in our party had the Eggs Creole which is an "Eggs Benny" style dish with a Crabcake w choice of Gratin Potatoes or two othersWe made a quick stop here on our way home from a camping trip and it BLEW ME AWAY; we were so supprised<//Review>

This is one of the best options for breakfast in the area. I feel they're a bit overpriced for what your getting.

Tip: If you're coming for brunch come earlier than you'd think because the line is always long. Sometimes it can take an hour to be seated at peak times.</Review><name>Nia Patterson<//name><user>108204089717228538967< /user>< gmapID>

This place is great for brunch. I come here regularly. My favorite are the nana, chocolate chip, walnut pancakes. They're the best pancakes ever! And the staff is always very kind and nice.

Tip: If you're coming for brunch come earlier than you'd think because the line is always long. Sometimes it can take an hour to be seated at peak times.< /Review>

I have only eaten breakfast here. At times there is a long wait. The food is good but I think it is expensive. They do not offer a kids menu. I found that disappointing because you have to buy a 3 year old an adult size meal.<//Review>

Their private parking lot is too small and you can only fix little cars and they put too many parking places in too small of a space.
The food is not good enough to deal with the parking problems.< /Review>

Must visit cafe along Ventura Harbor. Had crepes, fresh fruit, coffee and croissant for Sunday mid-morning meal. Nice place to eat and visit with friends indoors or outdoors in the open air cafe (memories of Southern France). Will visit on next trip.</Text>

The Eggs Benedict is The Best I've Ever had. My son had the Chorizo Steak or Burger and he Loved it. Full of Flavor & Very Tasty !
The prices are a Lil' $pendy, But the portions are worth it.<//review>

Excellent customer service and delicious menu, whenever one of the wat staff walked past they asked if they could top off our coffees and were just generally really friendly. Cute interior was decorated for the holidays. The two breakfast dishes we had were very tasty. I had the seasonal special with gorgonzola and bacon. Delicious!!!< /Review>

This is a cozy little staple in the edge of downtown Ventura serving a very eclectic menu which includes innovative items like bacon waffles and chile relleno burritos as well as all the classic breakfast favorites. They have indoor seating as well as a romantic outdoor patio. The wait staff is very attentive and acommadating.<//text>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>I ate here several years ago and thought it wasn't all that bad then. I hadn't been back until recently where my experience was completely different. I ordered an omelette with fruit. The eggs were completely over cooked and the fruit was less than stellar. And to boot, the prices are higher than anywhere else in Ventura. I hate giving negative reviews but I hope the proprietors read these reviews and make changes. I won't be spending any more money with this establishment.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80e9ace1d769e3e1:0x430ae333e970d2d4</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

What an incredible experience. We arrived in Ventura only 15 minutes before Cafe Nouveau was set to close, nearly resigned to order grilled cheese from the hotel room service menu. When I called to see if we could order take out, David insisted that we come in to eat and not rush despite their closing soon. He said their food was so good it shouldn’t sit in a plastic box. And he was right!

I enjoyed the mushroom risotto (talk about comfort food!) while my husband loved his Mahi Mahi tacos.

This restaurant has a great vibe, great food, and great service. We even walked out with a complementary treat for dining there.

And now that I’ve read their breakfast reviews, we will be back again tomorrow morning. Yum!!<//text>

The food is consistently good. The only drawback is waiting, especially Fridays & weekends. Also parking can be tight on weekdays. After 5 & on weekends there is a large city workers parking lot that the public can use. It is across Thompson Blvd behind the houses on the Blvd.<//text>

This estaishment needs a lesson in customer service. They just lost two customers today for horrible service issues and they probably won't care because they have the were always busy mantality. Well just wait more and more restaurants will open up around Ventura so you better step up your game.</Review>

The maple bacon beignets are to die for as well as the traditional ones and their dipping sauce. This place is fantastically decorated and has a get away feel.<//review>

<Text>The wait time was about 20 minutes. We were sat in a weird and busy zone inside the house, between the bathroom and what we're guessing was a kitchen, which had waiters constantly going in and out. It just felt really busy around us.

The food was good but really rich. We felt full after our starter alone - the maple bacon beignets. I ordered the matcha green tea tiramisu pancakes. It was tasty and fluffy but too much for me to eat at one sitting. I also ordered a side of bacon (my fave) which was probably the saltiest bacon I've ever had. I didn't like the bacon on its own but thought maybe they went for a saltier option for the maple bacon beignets, to offset the sugary sweetness of that item, one of the most popular items on their menu< /Text>< Pics>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Review>Potato's warm not hot. Very small potion.  House potato's where just potato's. No onion, bell pepper.   Smaller potions.  It is a ok breakfast place.  Busy. But food I had was ok.

During strawberry season.   But, only have strawberries for decoration per waitress.

It was very average.  And with a $37.00 bill for breakfast it was not even close to worth it.

Waitress was busy and mater of fact.  Not real friendly

Food was ok.   Nothing special.

My omelette was about $16.00.  Holy sh't.   All I had was onion, bell peppers, mushrooms and sour cream. And I just realized there was no cheese.

Place is clean and a nice atmosphere.

On the grill cheese they only forgot one thing.  The cheese.  Larger roll but used a mello cheese.   Should have used a Blue or Gouda  cheese.

End result.   Na. Do not bother

Week flavor and no creativity< /Review>< pictures>

<text>One of the best kept secrets in Ventura.  The Poblano Chili over the Sweet Potato Puree is my favorite but the Fish Tacos are a close second.    Food and service are outstanding!<//text></record>

This local gem affords a fun atmosphere with its colorful interior which dons eclectic furnishings reminiscent of Victorian, art deco & 50's diner eras. It's not a surprise there is a waiting list for a table because locals and visitors experience a culinary delight with any menu choice. Today hubby and I started with beignets, which were melt in your mouth amazing! Our main courses of sausage frittata and Nouveau garden omlet with au gratin potatoes were abundant servings of pleasurable flavor. We've been coming here for years and have always enjoyed delicious food, friendly, prompt and attentive service. We immediately think of Cafe Nouveau when hosting out of town visitors. Bon appetite!</Text>

We arrived when they opened. We were one of two tables occupied.  My veggie omelet was lukewarm, the scalloped potatoes were cold and the toast was soggy. Even the coffee was mediocre. Will not be returning.< /Text>

Charming breakfast place in a converted old home. Delicious Breakfast Benedicts for around $12. Complimentary coffee, cider and fruited water while you wait for a table. And tiny complimentary cupcakes are served in place of after dinner mints! Wanted to try the Beignets...but was too full. Highly recommend the au gratin breakfast potatoes. Sadly, no Diet Coke...my only disappointment. Tattooed be host was delightful. Server could have been friendlier but excellent bus staff kept our glasses filled and was very attentive!< /Review>

Great food and service. Wait staff very professional and knowlegable.
Parking can be a task but worth the effort as the food is great and plentyfull. Definately a return trip to enjoy another meal is planned for in the future.</review>

Very crowded arrived at 11am and had to wait 30 minutes to be seated.

Parking is difficult because it is a residential neighborhood so you will probably park on the side street

<text>Cafe Nouveau is absolutely our favorite breakfast restaurant in Ventura County. We drive in from Camarillo for their delicious, crispy waffles and the veggie omelets. Their menu is unique and fun. Wish they would open a restaurant in Camarillo!< /text>< Resp>

<userid>109014135056687453354<//userid><Date>1470552032867<//Date><Text>This place is really good! I had the seafood risotto and the New England clam chowder and both were delicious. The price isn't bad either, well, not for the amount of detail these folks put into their food. The complimentary marinara and bread exemplifies this point best. Using artichoke, olive, grape leaves and freshly baked white bread, marinara and bread are easily worth $3+ but they literally give it out, I had two portions lol. Anyway your probably in a passenger while your significant other is driving right now, so i'll stop yaking and just say one more thing stop by, you won't regret it.

Food                                 Service:
Freshness/quality: 5      waiters: nice ASF
Portions: 4.5                    timeliness: good

<text>We love this spot for Brunch! Dog-frendly, kid-friendly with high chairs and with a comfortable patio. The food is delicious and consistent and the service unbelieveable.
Within minutes of ordering drinks and apps, they are delivered . The servers always check on you multiple times too! Don't miss this great dining experience</text>< Time>

(Translated by Google) Excellent place for breakfast or dinner. Coarse and delicious dishes. If you do not mind the calories, I recommend the chocolate toast and any type of waffle. For dinner, the poblano del mar is something you should try. The staff very attentive and efficient. The owner very friendly and is always aware of any situation and with all customers. My favorite restaurant.

Por la cena el poblano del mar es algo que debes probar. El personal muy atento y eficiente. El propietario muy amable y siempre está pendiente de cualquier situación y con todos los clientes.
