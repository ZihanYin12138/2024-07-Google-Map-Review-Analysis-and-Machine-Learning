<review>I cant complain. Best dispensary out there. Good deals, good weed, best of all 20% discounts. When you go for happy hour. So look at it as you are paying regular price. The discount helps alot with tax. Honest buds. Been coming for a 1.. never again ANY other shop.<//review>< Pics>

Today's venture gained us 3 different varieties: Wedding Cake, White Mamba, & Lowell Lemon Lush (hybrid, indica & sativa). Kan-Ade came through with the goodies & a t-shirt. Happy Hour discounts and whatnot.
I give it a phat 👍🏾<//text>

<Text>The shop is great.. The tenders and personnel are pros. They only gripe i have is some of the flower they have is 6+ months old.. and no price breaks on old items.

Update.. still selling old products.. they have good deals though.. I think you shouldn't charge taxes on old products to get inventory moving.. Imo..<//Text><Name>Arthur Chavez< /Name></record>

<text>This was the best stocked store we found while in L.A. The selection was far and away the best. They had plenty of people to help, without being too pushy to move you along. They had a 'clearance cart,' and had deals for first timers. The way they have it set up makes it really easy to shop and check everything out. We'll be back in L.A. in a few months and will definitely be back.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0x6uFZPEr3EVArMnex6kiRa-3MW2PNTsQ-yAK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0DcOP49zXyaiU4o9Cq6vfiilwajH4vsr2029I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsMYDkwbMT_ZhbkgvI029R1SPoMY-aCQWFB8Hp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Mite infested clones (see pics). I drove up from Long Beach to pick up some up some dark heart clones. The shop looks nice from the front and inside, but when you start looking at the strains you will notice that only about 25% of them are actually in stock. I asked about a strain and bud tender said oh we haven't had that in a long time. Why is the jar still on display then? I guess they need to give the appearance of a huge shop with all this variety to justify long waits in line and high prices. I ask about the clones and the budtender says they just sold them sorry. I had called in advance less than an hour prior. She says they have more in the back but only their "clone guy" David handles them. Ok it happens... I'll try again tomorrow.

Day 2 I call in advance, they say can't hold them for you first come first serve. I make the 30 min drive up there again. David, goes to the back of the shop and brings out some clones. I take a quick peek and ask him a few questions about how they've been cared for so far. They have ropes keeping you about three feet from the counter so it wasn't easy to inspect them. My mistake was having faith in this shop to sell safe quality products and I didn't check them closely. I assumed the dark heart brand would carry some quality?

By the time I got home i realized they sold me the worst mite-infested clones you've ever seen. Had to make another hour round trip to get a refund - minus the gas money, time, and the tip I originally left.  David acted like he couldn't believe it and had no idea. If his job is to manage the clones then he needs to be replaced. I've had to sterilize everything in sight and hope I've seen the last of this shop's bugs. I should have really went over them closely before I left the shop. B real should be ashamed having any affiliation with this place, what a joke.

<Review>I loved it! Amazing selection, super helpful staff and great deals! I took advantage of 20% off for being a new customer and the next day 20% off if I went in before 10am. Mike Tyson’s Lemon Banana Sherbet hit the spot 🥊 🚀
Definitely going back when I hit Cali. If you don’t your insane in the membrane!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>Been coming here for a long time. Drgreenthumbs is always showing customers love with the daily morning specials. Definitely worth coming. The owner is top notch. Exemplifies customer satisfaction. During anniversary events he made sure people that slept overnight were well fed and taken care of. Never seen a clinic be so generous. Really good karma towards this store< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Budtenders be S-L-O-W. Lots of staff doing everything but helping customers. Expect a 20-40 min wait for a 3 min order. The deals here are really just market price for products that they charge extra for outside their happy hours. So there’s always a line out the door with people looking for cheap weed, when there are at least five other dispensaries within a 10 minute drive from here where the same products are much less expensive. If you’re standing in line here, get back in your car and drive to Skyhigh LA, Silverlake Caregivers, Syndicate Huntington, Greenwolf LA, or California Caregivers Alliance. Those are just off the top of my head. Dr Greenthumbs is a racket. Stop giving this poorly-run shop your business.< /Text>

<review>This was the best stocked store we found while in L.A. The selection was far and away the best. They had plenty of people to help, without being too pushy to move you along. They had a 'clearance cart,' and had deals for first timers. The way they have it set up makes it really easy to shop and check everything out. We'll be back in L.A. in a few months and will definitely be back.<//review>< Name>

The owners are extremely greedy and will not discount you on a defective product. Don’t even get me started on the curbside orders.

People are great, love the budtenders but recently got the buy one, get another for 1$ gpen pods with a free battery. Great deal, bad thing is that the battery and a pod were defected. Not their fault but don't feel like coming back< /Review>

Mite infested clones (see pics). I drove up from Long Beach to pick up some up some dark heart clones. The shop looks nice from the front and inside, but when you start looking at the strains you will notice that only about 25% of them are actually in stock. I asked about a strain and bud tender said oh we haven't had that in a long time. Why is the jar still on display then? I guess they need to give the appearance of a huge shop with all this variety to justify long waits in line and high prices. I ask about the clones and the budtender says they just sold them sorry. I had called in advance less than an hour prior. She says they have more in the back but only their "clone guy" David handles them. Ok it happens... I'll try again tomorrow.

Day 2 I call in advance, they say can't hold them for you first come first serve. I make the 30 min drive up there again. David, goes to the back of the shop and brings out some clones. I take a quick peek and ask him a few questions about how they've been cared for so far. They have ropes keeping you about three feet from the counter so it wasn't easy to inspect them. My mistake was having faith in this shop to sell safe quality products and I didn't check them closely. I assumed the dark heart brand would carry some quality?

By the time I got home i realized they sold me the worst mite-infested clones you've ever seen. Had to make another hour round trip to get a refund - minus the gas money, time, and the tip I originally left.  David acted like he couldn't believe it and had no idea. If his job is to manage the clones then he needs to be replaced. I've had to sterilize everything in sight and hope I've seen the last of this shop's bugs. I should have really went over them closely before I left the shop. B real should be ashamed having any affiliation with this place, what a joke.

Came across this place and I like it! They have a point system which is really awesome and daily deals. Went on a Friday they had 15% off and they also give first timers a 20% FYI you can’t stack deals. A really big variety of weed and you can actually see it because of Covid you aren’t allowed to touch or smell the weed but you can see it and that’s really helpful. Huge variety of edibles and anything you actually want. They sell bongs, vape, pens, flower. Check it out< /Review>

< review>
Parking is a little cramped, tbey do offer valet for their reserved spots at the end of the parking lot alongside the building. SOO MUCH to choose from, and i was told flower is half off or bogo or something on Friday's, but I've only been here once. Service was great, got what I came for, call ahead to double check they have what you want and tip your budtender!!< /review>

It was cool. They have a wide variety of many different strains. Bud tenders give great customer service and go out of their way to meet your needs. Perfect place to stop by if you're on the go and in need of some flower. In n out. Definitely returning.<//Text>

This was my first time at this shop it seemed like the Best Buy of pot shops. It was kind of over whelming in a way. It seemed clean, organized, but somewhat over priced.<//text>

<Text>For the most part the bud tenders are professional
However I'm more than several occasions I have experience inappropriate interactions I am assuming it is in their effort to encourage me to give more tips.

My favorite place to go. Bud tenders always 100 makes me go back. Also selections are always great. Prices are manageable. Always love spending my money here.<//Review>

Yesterday I went to Dr. Greenthumb’s and had the best experience from how helpful and informative Crystal and everyone in their staff was.  Hands down the best time I have had at any cannabis store since I have visited California and a special thanks to Crystal for helping me find everything I needed .< /Review>

Shout out to Mariah sorry if I spell your name wrong. She was extremely helpful, professional, patient,  and generous. I honestly don't do reviews but I went there a week ago and couldn't believe her generosity. Thank you so so much. And the weed was 🔥🔥🔥🔥< /Review>

<review>A cool shop easy registration first time. Its well lit with a nice display setup. They carry alot of brands so you'll definitely get some fire. They also carry some brands and strains you can't get at any dispensary like backpack boys etc. They also carry the napalm grenade by Xzibit one of only a few to carry it. If you like to smoke top quality the 150 is worth it (172.88) with tax lol I bought a few< /review><rating>3<//rating>< GmapID>

First time visiting and was amazed by the size and scope of the store. The store was clean, well lit, TONS of products throughout and friendly, helpful staff. Dr. Greenthumbs appeared to have something for everyone, with flower prices ranging from $25 to $75+ per 3.5. I really enjoyed the way the flower was displayed, in individual magnified containers with built in "aroma ports." This store hints at what MJ dispensaries can feel like in the post abolition phase of the industry.</Review>

Me and my brother drove down today from San Diego. I was super excited 😁 to finally get the chance to go. Let me tell you the  Inside is a really huge area with nice lighting and plenty of samples to look at. I love that they are all are individually labeled with name,thc percantage,cbd % in small container with aroma holes. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. Our budtender was the best by recommending the Kush Og it has the best taste and great high. The drive here was totally worth it and will be going back ☺. Thanks Dr.Greenthumb!!!
DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!! Medical and Recreational<//Text>

Um yes please! So I live down the street and drove past Dr Green Thumbs a few weeks ago. So on my way home tonight, I decided I needed a little treat. You are greeted with red carpet and ample illumination from the front door. After the doors open slow as schit, you walk into Heaven absolute Heaven. They have EV-VER-RYthing! It's like MED MEN meets your favorite low key local shop with great budtenders, excellent weed, and awesome deals. They are open from I think 8 to 10. It's like 25% tax, less with your rec. You get 20% off your first time and I think in the am you get 20% off for happy hour. It's my new spot. Thanks Doc! Chappy Cholidays to all and a Puffy Nuevo Año.< /Text>

I highly challenge the knowledge of these budtenders .
Firstly they couldn't identify the difference between Flow Kana label Indica & CBD.

Nor could they provide which are outdoor grown to the indoor grown brands.(flower)

And those display containers are a joke a majority of that flower is dried out and have little to no aroma. FYI bring hand sanitizer.

I ended up buying 7 grams of the Cypress Cannabis-Double Grape. And 3.5 grams of the Fire Society-Lava Cake

The Double Grape was perfect. nice and fresh,aromatic once opened.
As for the Fire Society it was so dried out,i had no reason to use a grinder.

Pls stock up on Flow Kana with high thc potency</text>

I noticed that a new dispensary opened up right near my house (less than 2 miles away) not only is it close, they carry all my favorite brands/goods (Loudpack, Runtz, Cavi Cones, Cookies, etc. plus everyone was super friendly and helpful! I’m excited about the early bird deals (20% off in the morning) and will absolutely be back again and again and againnnnn< /Review>

< Review>
This to me, is the best African Restaurant in south LA! I ordered okra soup and Eba with extra meat. This was the most reasonable priced African food I had with the amount of food I got! It was so tasty, like back home. And it was a lot of food, I couldn't finish! The cook and his wife came out to say hello (this is huge for African Restaurant to show good customer service). I was overall impressed and can't wait to go back. I will love to try more things on the menu and would write subsequent reviews< /Review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>I used to really like this place. Yesterday I ordered jollof rice and chicken. It took them 40 minutes to prepare my order. When I opened it, the plantain was gummy (you could tell it was not made to order and they just reheated old plantain), the chicken was taken from stew and was limp (as opposed to them frying it like they were supposed to) and the rice was just clumped together. It ended up in the trash. Food was not fresh. For the price, they have a lot of nerve.<//Text>< pictures>

The meats were seasoned to the bones...literally!!!! The entire meal was Super tasty with perfect spice. My son thoroughly enjoyed his meal as well. I will definitely return and tell my friends about this place if they ever visit LA area. I always rate my meals, I gave my stew a 10-10! My fried plantains were cooked to perfection, however they sprinkled salt on them so I couldn't enjoy them as much; my family ate them for me.< /Review>

<review>Yesterday was my first time going to this place. Sad to expect a certain kind of "Nigerianness" in the environment and customer service which left a whole lot to be desired. Your orders are taken and asked to sit wherever you like and no one asks or offers something to drink while you wait 30-45 minutes for your food.
But truth be told, I didn't come here for the ambience or the customer service, I came for the food.
My request was for bitterleaf soup and pounded yam. The presentation was perfect and I looked forward to devouring every bit of the food and licking the plate...HOWEVER, the soup was extremely too salty. So salty I was unable to eat the soup after downing the food(since I already paid for it). And since no one bothers to come ask you "how's your food", or "would you like anything else?" You know, the little things we take for granted in "American" restaurants and cafes, I could not tell them my soup was extremely salty.
Time to pay for my meal, I stood in front of the counter for close to 5 minutes, and while they all saw me standing there after my meal, they ignored me and carried on with their conversations with friends after which I was kindly asked, "are you ready to check out?"..
Men....that soup looked really good and well made..but for the salt.</review>< user>

I actually got the food for my birthday, I got it early because of quarantine, I ordered ahead, and I will admit that the wait was long and I was kinda bored, but me and my family had really been wanting to go there for quite some time so I took my birthday as an opportunity to go. I called ahead and ordered the fish pepper soup (the picture below but like not as aesthetically pleasing, since this is a google picture). It took 22 minutes to be made in total, idk if that's a long wait for some of you. While there I got a family owned shop vibe, and the owner was very polite to me, (although the phone call was different, mostly because I can't understand accents that well through the phone in particular) he told me to sit and wait as it was still being made, I was nervous because I get very nervous in new places and around people whom I don't know. He finally came out with this very small container that cost $15 and I was livid because it was so small and yet so expensive. But I finally got home and ate it and the taste was immaculate, it was absolutely delicious, I couldn't have asked for a better soup ever in my life. It was definitely worth the experience. It was spicy though (obviously) but it didn't matter because I love spice and the taste was so good I didn't care, it had a strong bold unique taste, it was sour, salty, spicy, umami, and sweet, literally all the taste. IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD, even with my social anxiety I would 100% experience that again just for the taste. There were a lot of fish bones and like I hate fish bones but it was worth picking it out for that flavor. And I dislike fish skin, but once again, the flavor smacked. There is this african thing called fufu, I meant to get it but once again social anxiety, but I believe it would pair perfectly with this delicious soup<//Review>

Horrible horrible food, service and environment. I just got rice and stew and the stew tasted like a can of tomato paste. Absolutely no flavor at all. That wasn't the worst part. The owners carried on conversations sitting in the dining area. They had 2 teenaged boys watching basketball and screaming at the TV being rowdy and a baby, running around the restaurant banging things and making all sorts of noise. Just UGH</text>

This place feels pretty authentic in terms of quality and customer service. The food was good but the prices were too high in my opinion. The place needs to be renovated and made to look new if they really expect anyone to be okay with the menu prices.</Text>

I ordered for take away so I sat about 15 minutes waiting for my order. By the time I got home it did get a little soggy and the bun was falling apart.I went with the burger and lamb. Although I feel like they put the beef instead unless that's just how their lamb tastes.This was gooey cheesy goodness. The gravy is just extra deliciousness.</text>

Horrible and tasteless food. No ventilation. Went with my friends and everyone of us feels the same way. If you have to really eat here, to be safe just go for pepper soup and goat meat. I forgot to add the service was extremely horrible.</Text>

<Review>Trust me folks.I was at Nkechi African cafe today with my family on our 2 week holiday  to California. This is the best Nigerian restaurant  that I ever visited.The jollof rice was toothsome and highly delicious.Great and friendly  service.
Wow,simply cannot wait to be there  again.
If you are visiting  Los Angeles as a Nigerian,a visit to this great restaurant  will make  you feel home away from home.
I doff my hat to Nkechi restaurant</Review>< pictures>

<review>I am giving this place a 4. It was clean, food came out promptly, and the stew, moi moi, and Jollof Rice were delicious and on point. The reason it's not a 5, The egusi soup was bland, and no spices or pepper, and I get that it's a family owned restaurant, but the kids were the servers and were engrossed in the Notre Dame game. When he finally came over, he asked me what I wanted. Being new to the place I asked for a menu. The menu should be offered no matter who it is. Overall 4 stars for the convenience, cleanliness and timeliness of the food. Thank you</review>< userid>

There is no professionalism with these guys. They’re not receptive at all. Customer service is very important, but these guys don’t have it. Food overpriced yet there’s no appreciation. The owner of the place selects those that she relates well with. From the moment you enter the place , there’s no proper welcome nor appreciation. Wish I could get another place. Food salty too.< /Review>

Just came to LA for work. Was looking for an african restaurant. Saw this particular base on the review. I have to drive almost 50mins to get those cos I was craving for African food. Got there it took them a while to attend to me. Gave me a menu took a while to get back to me, vegetable one of the most common food they don't have I ask for jollof rice the man said no more rice with so much attitude will never recommend.< /Text>

We called in 15 minutes before getting there and got there and still waited for an hour 30 mins to get Egusi soup 4 plates. 2 on our party left. Shame this is the best LA has to offer. No ventilation, hot restaurant with poor customer service.</Review>

I went late one night and I will never go again, I thought they were giving me stew, they gave me fried fish dropped in greasy tomato sauce over white rice, no other veggies or flavor in "stew" and no nutrients whatsoever. What makes this Nigerian good, and for $15 that's crazy!<//Review>

The service is excellent and the place is welcoming. I will NEVER EVER go near Veronica's again in life now that I found Nkechi.<//text>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>Food was ok, very poor customer service and unpleasant attitude. The restaurant needs to be cleaned. Was irritated by the environment, had too many filt on the floor. The guy that served me kept cleaning his nose with his hand, that was nasty. He practically tossed a bag at me to pack my food myself. Long wait time even after ordering ahead. I got a bill with no tax item on the list but tax added to the final amount. Customer service is unacceptably poor.< /Text>< time>

<Review>This is my second time in California and first time dining in an African restaurant here. I came to Nkechi after seeing the 4.0 google rating. In a nutshell, they tried to be nice but the egusi soup was tasteless...not enough salt and it has a slight bitter taste to it. You can tell they used 'jollof seasoning' in their jollof rice and stew which was saturated with salt/maggi...the food is nothing like African dish, just coloring and water. The plantain was okay...not ripe enough for me though. If you know how to cook, then you know. Definitely not returning.<//Review>< user_name>

It's always wonderful to eat at Nkechi African cafe.  It is a home meal far away from the mother land.  The organization management is always amazing.

Service was poor. Waitress was rude. Waited over an hour to get our food. When my food finally arrived, my egusi and fried fish was killed with salt. Service was terrible. I definately won't come back to this place.</Text>

<time>1450756678730</time><Rating>5</Rating><Text>Most African restaurants in LA serve Ethiopian cuisine. Food from the Western regions of Africa are more difficult to find. Veronica's Kitchen and Nkechi African Cafe, both family-owned restaurants in Inglewood, are the only restaurants in LA that offer a taste of Nigeria.

Staples of Nigerian cuisine appear to be heavy flavored dry soups and very spicy meat stews, eaten with a starchy mound of yam dough called fufu. On a Friday evening, we ordered two very traditional Nigerian specialties: isi-ewu also known as a spicy goat casserole and an egusi soup which is a viscous soup prepared with ground melon seeds.

Nkechi's offering of isi-ewu was critical in my decision to try Nkechi instead Veronica's Kitchen, which only has nkwobi (cow leg) on the menu. I wanted to eat something exotic that night.

Isi-ewu is a unique and impressive stew for adventurous eaters. The main component of this dish is the goat head and the stew includes the brain! The preparation process is extremely tedious, as all the goat hairs have to be removed and the head needs to be thoroughly washed. The head is steamed/boiled, cut into smaller pieces, and then the meat stock is simmered in a sauce that contains a blend of chili spices and seasoning. This Nigerian delicacy is extremely spicy, and the sauce was a bit overwhelming compared to the flavors of the meat, so be prepared to order some water or a palm wine if you need to relieve the overwhelming heat.

On the other hand, egusi soup is more mellow. It is a viscous soup consisting of melon seeds, spinach, and a choice of meat (fish, chicken, mutton, cow leg). The preparation of this most popular Nigerian soup is also labor intensive, requiring melon seeds to be ground and made into a paste before the paste is mixed with spices stir-fried, and then the product is boiled with meat stock. We chose tilapia as the stock, which was dry and had bones. The taste was slightly bitter but also very rich, which was not expected for a soup with similar consistency of Chinese porridge. The soup is very nutritious and many Nigerians enjoy it with fufu, a firm white ball pounded from from yam flour. Fufu is generally flavorless so it is used to scoop up soup or stew (similar function to injera in Ethiopian cuisine, I think).

Portions at Nkechi are generous and two hungry diners can easily share a soup and meat stew, then bring home leftovers. Service was prompt and the server was extremely patient. Everyone else at the restaurant were native-Africans, so this seems to be the place to find local African food. The damage for this dinner was $45 not including tip, which is expensive for only 2 dishes but understandable considering the native spices and fresh ingredients used, as well as the amount of labor required to prepare each dish.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Good experience and food. We had the stew with rice,plantains,suya,moi-moi and egosi soup with assorted meats. Kinda pricy but nigerian food can be expensive due to ingredients. We will come back if we are in LA again.<//Text>

Ok here's what happened..I like to eat african and luckily for me I live with females who love to cook but im flexible bcoz I eat and crave fast food too. So one day everybody in the house traveled and I was left at my own mercy whether or not to try to cook me some African food or eat fast food. I got so hungry at one point and began searching online to see what restaurant sounded good and booom!! I stumbled upon Nkechi's..., read the online reviews and quickly felt confident goin there. Schemed thru the menu and reluctantly went for the ogbono soup and fufu with goat meat (Essie-wu), then laced it with some palm wine...O.M.G!!!! Thats all I will say.<//review>

<Review>If you love Korean food please please do not go here. Ordered 3 dishes:  간장게장crab in soy sauce came out spoiled (vinegary taste).  갈비탕Rib soup tasted awful (can't even describe the taste). 감자탕Potato stew had meat  that looked black & tasted like rubber.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Food was good. Generous with side dishes. The price is not the cheapest but you get a generous portion and the taste is one of the better Korean foods in the area.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I love this place. First, their service is always awesome. They're very friendly and almost like family. Second, their food is awesome. You can find many traditional Korean dishes here. Third, they're pretty cheap compared to most other places for this quality. They also have free parking and are located right in the middle or Korea Town. Very convenient. Awesome restaurant!!<//Review>< pics>

Very reasonable price for individual dishes compared to other Korean restaurants.  Not a fancy place but the price is good.  They have TVs. My favorite is the octopus over veggies and rice in hot stone pot. They give you a mix of side dishes - my favorites are the kimchi radish and seaweed.
Don't try to ask about genetically modified ingredients in the food though, lol.</review>

(Translated by Google) The soy sauce crab is so delicious. It's not salty, it's a lot, and it's really delicious! There is a place called the name of soy sauce crab at Geumgang Estuary in Gunsan, but it tastes comparable to that of the house. Thank you for making it delicious. Great place for Korean food. The name'delicious table' is so true and perfect for this restaurant. All good but my favorite is the'ganjang gejang' or'sea crabs marinated in soy sauce! The best in L.A./Orange couty!!

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>(Translated by Google) What makes this food with these ingredients is unbelievable.
I can not eat it because it tastes like it's stinging like a crab.
The shrimp contained everything that turned black.
I can not imagine that I did not know these ingredients.
I took a take-out and brought it home 30 minutes away.
And where did the $ 50 container come from?

(Original)
뭐 이딴 재료로 음식을 만드는지 기가 막힙니다
게는 얼마나 오래된건지 다리에는 살도 없고 삭힌것처럼 쏘는 맛이나서 도저히 먹을 수가 없네요
새우는 다리가 전부 검게 변한걸 넣었네요
이런 재료를 모르고 넣었다고는 생각할 수 없는 상태입니다
테이크아웃해서 30분 떨어진 집으로 가져왔기에 시간이 아까워서 리턴 못하고 다 버렸습니다
그러고 $50 이나 받는 용기는 어디서 나온건지..< /text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Soy sauce is not the only disappointment.
I came after the surgery because I want to eat crab ...
It was really delicious years ago.
Be increasingly disappointed
I'm upset this time.
The big egg in the leg is like plastic.
It is small and slightly mixed with medium,
I think it would be better to subtract the photo of the soy sauce that the customer had previously

간장게장 실망이 이만저만이 아니네요
수술후 게장이 먹고싶다해서 왔는데...
몇년전에는 정말 맛있었는데
점점 실망하다
이번에는 화가 나네요
게다리에 커다란 알이 플라스틱 같아요
작아지고 살짝 중간것이 섞여  있고 휴ㅡ
예전에 고객이 올린 간장게장 사진은 아예 빼는게 좋을거 같습니다< /Text>

I ordered for pick up from the app and I received the saddest sandwich. Missing ingredients i asked for (cheese and black olives) the ingredients i did receive was little to none. It was the emptiest saddest sandwich I've ever gotten at a subway. I also ask for extra mayo. Barely any mayo. The customer service was a bit rude but it didn't bother me much. I just want my sandwich done right.<//Text>

<review>Very disappointed with two female employees, they were talking in their language and giggling to each other while they were serving the customers. I am sure probably saying something funny about the customer. My sandwich was so soggy because she rushed to do  with so much of source. This is not the first time they talked to each other in Punjabi. Ladies you can talk in your language but not when serving customers.</review></record>

I don't eat these sandwiches too often, but at my last visit they informed me that they have discontinued roast beef. Wow.</Review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><text>Placed a pick up order and requested my bread toasted with swiss cheese. The bread was not toasted and no cheese. I also ordered a raspberry cheesecake cookie and received chocolate chip. When I went to pick it up it was just slapped on the counter. I know it's not the biggest deal in the world but it would be nice to receive what you paid for.<//text>< Pics>

<text>Ordered chicken ceacer wrap,they put only one scoop of chicken on wrap when your paying for two scoops. All other Subways put two scoops.  They charge the same price. Don't buy from this Subway they are a rip off. I said if you don't make it the same as the other Subways then keep it. I walked out and went to different Subway, the second store put two scoops.<//text>< response>

Horrible customer service . Nikki a worker at this location was absolutely not helpful at all . She mocked me and my girlfriend under her breath as we simply just ordered our sandwiches. As if we were asking for something unreasonable, when my most complicated request was just a bit more sauce on my sandwich. Nikki has left a horrible taste in my mouth with this experience at this location. She was mean unprofessional and simply should not be able to serve people with such negativity directed at the customer.<//Text>

Oof, why do I keep coming here, that's it, never again!  They never understand what I'm saying AND I even tried telling them in Urdu/Hindi, I'm bilingual, still never understand...  So getting a sandwhich you want is about a 20 minute process, they could atleast act like they want to help/customer service me when I walk in!  Latest sandwhich fail: i ordered the current promotional "chicken parmasean" sandwhich, simple enough, chicken cheese marinara... She bakes my sandwhich and then asks what kind of mustard I want, I replied I want it like the picture haha and she forgot the cheese, so she puts cheese on and then asks honey mustard? I said nooo I would like marinara, she's like oh fine, gets a spoonful of marina from the meatball dish and pours it on, I say thats it, pay and sit down, they ring me up for a meal, just ordered th sandwhich, finally sit down after getting refunded and repurchasing and lo and behold, the marinara is freezing cold, the dish they keep it in isn't even warm!!?! Gotta be a health hazard, I'm guessing it should've been warm atleast and then they bake my sandwhich to heat up the sauce... Well I go back up and they refuse to make me a new sandwhich WTF!? You poured cold sauce on my toasted sandwhich, defeating the purpose of a warm sandwhich hahaha this franchise is ridiculous do NOT come to this location!!</Review>

Asked them if we can get a new batch and this is what they came out with. The 2 on the side were given to us after the ones on the left because we paid for an 8 piece originally so they put something together quickly and that's what they came out with. Feel like the staff that originally took our order, Ariana, was almost disrespectful and I tried to be as polite as I could. I said I'm sorry when I originally told them if I could get a new batch, so it was a bit unfair. I could have been extremely rude if anything.< /Review>< Date>

Greta location and great staff. It just needs more tables to dine in. We always went to salinas or santa Cruz for wings but now we have one in our community.</review>

Wings are good but their service is terrible, we have had the same experience more than three times. We ordered ahead (when they decided to pick up the phone) and also online. We went to pick up at the time we were told and we still had to wait another 30 minutes because our order wasn't ready. Their costumer service and time management skills needs to improve.<//Review>

< Review>
This place isnt that great. Obviously it's my fault for thinking the plain wings would just be normal, non spicy, seasoned wings, but they took the word plain literally. I mean who wants  unseasoned, unsalted, flavorless chicken wings? And on the complete opposite side of the spectrum, we have the fries being over seasoned and salty to the point where I feel disgusting. Also the mild wings taste like the ones from the grocery store, but like the cold ones that you heat up and put buffalo sauce on it yourself ya know. Anyways shouldve gone to kurger bing<//Review>

I love wingstop im general but it would be great if the MANAGER IVAN would get retrained, and get some management skills no manners and way to talk to his employees infront of costumers. We are going through hard times and we the people support our food industry but some people are losing it. He definitely needs some write ups. Not the first time ive had a bad experience there . Specially specifically with IVan the manager""".</Review>

I like the chicken wings . I like fries. They are generous with the fries. But I recommend you order before you go in , because it's usually a 15 minute wait, or more depending how many customers are in wing stop.< /text>

<Text>Wings are great but twice now I have placed online orders around 11:15 for my wings to be ready for me at 12. The first time they hadn't even started my order at all when I got there. The second time they had "just started making them". I even called both times to make sure my order went through and specifically asked if it would be ready at noon. I have a 30 minute lunch so I really needed them on time, that's why I placed the order early online.< /Text></record>

I've placed Future orders 3 times and they always manage to never have my order ready on time. Place my order pretty early in the afternoon and I arrive and my orders are never ready on time. Out of the 3 time I've done that two of my orders were wrong. This review of for their service and not their food. Food is good. Not BDubs good but they're ok.</review>

Food was good the customer service needs lots of improvement. The young women named Aileen who took are order was in such a rude mode. I ask to clean the table because it was sticky and she roll her eyes. I did tell her thank and sorry to bother I know you got upset. Her answer was that is my everyday face trust me. How would I trust her?! Really they need to be tech proper etiquette</Text>

<review>I'm not going to lie I , myself dont love wings period. My family on the other hand does. Wing stop is their favorite wing spot and they are so glad there is one here in Watsonville again! I'm giving 4 stars for the French fries and friendly staff. Thank you for always being so polite and happy.</review><Rate>4<//Rate><Name>carrie h<//Name><user>111862270038045387184</user><pics>None</pics><gmap_id>0x808e1a5aa53e1acf:0x74f115f95f2a6a79< /gmap_id>< Date>

<rate>1</rate><text>Although it's beginning to rise up and establish its reputation in the Watsonville community, Wingstop has a long way to go to offer the best wings in Watsonville.

UPDATE: No improvement in any way. Too overcrowded and orders take too much time. You have to wait there as you awkwardly stare at irritated people waiting for their food. I had many issues with my fries being cold and the wings lacking sauce. Still doesn't live up to my expectations and most likely won't.</text>< pics>

Tasty wangs, easy call up and order & food was ready on time. It's pricey goodness,  my only complaint was that 3 of 4 sodas that I chose were unavailable but my 4th choice was Icecream Orange Soda which was surprisingly good.<//text>

My fiance and I came here for a quick bite to eat on a Sunday afternoon. We were plesently greeted by Andrea. We were unsure of what to order and what was best for our buck, however Andrea throughly explained the menu and assured us the best value to tasty wing ratio. We are completly satisified and she even helped us out with a  2 quarters out of her own pocket. She definetly needs a raise!!</text>

<text>Came here a night ago to get some wings and fries to go, when I got home I noticed I ended up getting completely different wings that I didn't even ask for but I got the same amount that I payed for(15) . I was OK with this,  I'd let that slide any day especially since it was almost closing time for them. later that night I'm running to the bathroom vomiting my brains out for about an hour. I go to the doctor the next day tells me I got food poisoning and a virus from the food. so in one meal I got a side of pharmacy pills, a visit to the doctor and extra medical expenses. 10/10  would come here to get food poisoning again .</text>< Pics>

<Text>I'm not sure what happened exactly. I went in with my bf to pick up our online order they said it would be a few minutes. They knew we were together and we sat together. We waited at least 15 minutes before I told my bf I was going to walk to food maxx to get something to drink which took maybe 8 mins if that. I got back and still no order. I asked him if they said anything to him and he said no. So we waited another 10-15 mins before someone who had just walked in before I left for food maxx received their order... I asked them and they finally said they had tried calling me. My phone was on silent and they literally called me 4 feet in front of my bf like why not just tell him? And call me in the 8 mins I went to food maxx out of almost 40 mins of waiting but my bf was there and we were the only people waiting for an order and they saw me come back. Out of 25 boneless wings, we had ordered 5 Hawaiian and they were out of the Hawaiian sauce. Why not say something when I first walked in, when we were there for 15 minutes, or when I walked back in the store. Again we were the only ones waiting for an online order. The crew was awkward to say the least they didn't seem capable of doing anything separate and had to constantly look at the few orders they did have. One girl constantly wiped her hands on her jeans and I mean constantly. Like 5 or 6 times each time she would do it every minute or two. I think if it was a different crew I would go back. Weird to have that awkward of a crew on a Saturday night.</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) No, the truth is this place. They do not have lids for the glasses, I mean, there is not what you occupy at hand, the attention I do not really care, not the food I do not want to pee if the attention and the cleaning, and the supply of the utensils who take care to eat and see,

(Original)
No   , la verdad este lugar . No no tienen tapaderas para los vaso , osea no hay lo q ocupas a la mano , la atencion no me guato en realidad , , no de la comida no me kejo peeo si de la atencion y de la limpieza , y el abastesimiento de lls utencilios q se ocuan para comer y vever ,<//review>

I went to go get my acrylic nails removed (which i can do by myself but didn't want to deal with it). I waited for like 20 minutes no big deal. There was no one behind me so I thought she'd take her time, but when the lady was removing my nails she cut me not once (which is still bad) but TWICE!! The second time really bad to where, if she hadn't put nail glue on it (which is not good either), it could literally lift up!!!!! It hurts when it touches anything and its throbbing!!!! And I still payed.... Never going again and wouldn't recommend!!!< /Review>< Pics>

<text>This was my first time to Old Town Nails on Saturday.   A lady who spoke no English  did my pedicure.     It was a rush job because she had to stop and run to the backroom several time during my pedicure. It was a very unprofessional atmosphere due to the noise of children crying in the backroom.  There were little girls running around the place as if it was a daycare/nails salon. I was trying to relax but was not able.   in addition, the workers were yelling to each other  back and forth .  Paid $50 for pedicure with tips but was not happy.    Will not be coming back.</text><Rate>1<//Rate><user>117936387312928500356< /user>< response>

FABULOUS! My mom and I just had manicures and pedicures with Christina and Nancy. It was a wonderful experience, one of the best pedicures I've had. The paraffin wax and hot stones are wonderful and make for a very relaxing experience. Both Christina and Nancy are so lovely! Our nails look fantastic and we will be back for sure! If you are looking for somewhere to go, look no further!</text>

I have been to numerous nail salons here in the valley that only care about getting you in and out as quick as possible so they can move on to the next guest! Not great when removing dipping powder as it takes much longer than gel but is so much better for your nails! Finally found a place that is willing to put the health of your nails and customer service first!! Kudos to Andy for making Old town Nails my go to salon - fantastic experience and the staff are so friendly too!< /Text>

Great service, professional, and wow !
This is one of the best places for ingrown toenails.
The location in old town La Quinta is  very easy to find and accessible.
As we age our toe nails keep growing.
Men need a good pedicure too !< /Review>

<Review>The girl was pushy, rough and rushed through my pedicure and manicure. Then she  put my sandal on my foot when I told her not to and because my nails were not dry yet. She didn’t listen and put the sandal on and put a big dent in my big toe. She didn’t even offer to fix it. She didn’t speak very good English and was very rude. I will never go back there again.</Review><user_name>Kathy Diamond</user_name>< gmapID>

< Review>
Just had mani/pedi. Great experience! Easy parking, very clean.  Tina the owner personally came over to help with ingrown toenails and spent a lot of extra time making sure they were cut.  Priced like big chain nail salons but felt like a boutique experience. Maggie did mani and she was fast, thorough and friendly. Have tried a lot of places in La Quinta and this is hands down the best. Love this place and cannot recommend it enough!<//Review>

Terrible experience here. We walked in to get manicures and I asked if they offered dip powder manicures (I had a dip powder French manicure on) and they said yes. The woman who was doing my manicure started to file down my current dip powder on my nails and then proceeded to fill with acrylic. I stopped her and said, "No, I don't have pink and white on my nails, this is dip powder" and told her that this was to be soaked off and reapplied. She said that "we don't have dip powder for French manicure, only dip powder in colors" to which I said that was fine - I would pick out a dip powder color. She then continued to try to fill my nails with the pink and white and I kept telling her that's not what I had on my nails - she told me to stop and that she knew what she was doing and that what she was doing "was better for me." She proceeded to fill over my dip powder with the pink and white acrylic which looked terrible - it didn't match the pink and she did nothing to fix the white, which was chipped. She then tried to cover all of it with a regular pink OPI nail polish, didn't do anything with my cuticles or even perform a manicure and then charged full price. Steer clear of this place - liars.<//review>

Okay. Let’s leave off the distractions like misspelled words in the menu and undertrained waitstaff that other reviewers complained about and talk about the FOOD which is AMAZING. Fresh pasta made in house? Yup. Farm fresh kale and pomegranate and squash and corn? Yup. House made potato chips to die for? Yup. Pet-friendly patio and indoor booth seating? Yup. Temple coffee served in a French press? A thousand times yes. They even have gluten free and vegan options. Do yourself a favor and go for dinner. Try their seasonal pumpkin cake, it’s so delicious. And then go back for lunch. I’ll probably see you there :)</text>

Oh my gosh, this restaurant is a hidden gem.  We love love the Bourbon Bacon Hamburger!  Have been there several times since we discovered this place, and never have been disappointed.   We really enjoy sitting outside, it's so relaxing as you can see and enjoy the view of the water.  My new place to eat.  Thank you for the great food!!! We will be back!!!<//Review>

<text>Oakwater offers a chef's table at a reasonable price. The wine list offers quality choices also at reasonable prices. The atmosphere is cozy. We have been there three times. Each time the waitstaff seems to be training. Plan some extra time. Honestly, it is nice to have some time to enjoy being out with friends and family.< /text>< gmapID>

This place is incredible! My girlfriend is gluten free and we struggle to find quality options sometimes. This place went above and beyond. Great customer service. The owner/chef came and checked on us. The food was great and the setting is unique and beautiful. We can’t wait to go back!</text>

Pretty underwhelming. My scallops were cooked beautifully, the sides were bland. The beet salad was nice. My husband asked to be surprised and the waiter chose the porkchop which was overcooked and when my husband told him the waiter replied oh well at least you enjoyed some of it. So maybe we will try brunch sometime but not in a hurry to go back for dinner.</review>

<Text>Lovely waitess, pleasant dessert, very nice side salad. That said, mostly nothing special about the food, especially for the price. Soup was under seasoned and quite bland, trying to be overwhelming with two beef patties on the burger was unappealing and lacking the grilled taste expected in a great burger, it was more like smooshy meatloaf. While I don't doubt the excellent quality of the offerings here, the end product is just not engaging enough to entice a return visit. Nice setting, nice folks, wish you well, need to consider upping the ante on taste.</Text>< userid>

It was terrible. Bland salad, and overcooked bland Salmon. The Chicken Rigatoni Marsala sauce tasted like flour. We did not eat our entries, we left and went somewhere else. We were very disappointed. It was certainly not worth the drive from Placerville to check it out.< /text>

<text>Served spoiled scallops. Only ate one out of the three and told the waiter why. No comment or compensation. Tried to contact manager by phone and email but no response.
Waited an hour for entree’s. Waiter did not check on us or fill water glasses.
Three out of four entree’s were bland. The fourth entree was the scallops that smelled like ammonia. The cauliflower purée served with it was delicious and I would of liked to of had more of it.
The payment process is terrible and the waiter stands over you and waits until you are finished so the iPad is not left at the table (I’m assuming). Is there only one?
Did like location, ambiance and decor but question the ethics of chef and management, and food is not great so will not be back.<//text><gmap_id>0x809ae1dc36381589:0x946347b412a5b056<//gmap_id><pics>None< /pics></record>

<review>Overpriced and disappointing. Loud and anything but cozy on a cold, rainy night. All four of our entrees were underwhelming, which were $15-30 each. At $200 including 4 entrees, 2 appetizers, 2 desserts, a $30 bottle of wine and tip, I’d rather spend a little more and celebrate a special occasion next door at Hawks.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Okay. Let’s leave off the distractions like misspelled words in the menu and undertrained waitstaff that other reviewers complained about and talk about the FOOD which is AMAZING. Fresh pasta made in house? Yup. Farm fresh kale and pomegranate and squash and corn? Yup. House made potato chips to die for? Yup. Pet-friendly patio and indoor booth seating? Yup. Temple coffee served in a French press? A thousand times yes. They even have gluten free and vegan options. Do yourself a favor and go for dinner. Try their seasonal pumpkin cake, it’s so delicious. And then go back for lunch. I’ll probably see you there :)< /Review>< pictures>

My family held a 30+ person party in the side bar area of this facility. The service was amazing, the food was high quality and good prices, great portions and did I mention high quality? I would bring a relaxed date here to eat lunch with a beer, or have a fancy night out in one of the best areas Granite Bay has to offer! The beer variety is extensive with light to dark and everything in between. We couldn't have chosen a better place to come for the party since everyone was extremely impressed with the entire atmosphere and food. Thanks to this place for such a fun day!< /text>

We have been there three times. Each time the waitstaff seems to be training. Plan some extra time. Honestly, it is nice to have some time to enjoy being out with friends and family.</Text>< Pics>

Nice, modern atmosphere, nice menu variety, good food, reasonably speedy service. Vegetarians / vegans will appreciate that any of the burgers can be substituted for the impossible burger. Servers have always been friendly.</Text>

Staff were on point. Lasagna was wellmade and fresh even on an early tuesday night. Beer selection is mostly local with a good variance of styles, all bottles no draft but not old. Bit pricey but still cheaper and much quieter than hawks. Lunch menu looked more interesting than dinner, looking forward to it.</Text>

Pretty underwhelming. My scallops were cooked beautifully, the sides were bland. The beet salad was nice. My husband asked to be surprised and the waiter chose the porkchop which was overcooked and when my husband told him the waiter replied oh well at least you enjoyed some of it. So maybe we will try brunch sometime but not in a hurry to go back for dinner.</text>

<review>Lovely waitess, pleasant dessert, very nice side salad. That said, mostly nothing special about the food, especially for the price. Soup was under seasoned and quite bland, trying to be overwhelming with two beef patties on the burger was unappealing and lacking the grilled taste expected in a great burger, it was more like smooshy meatloaf. While I don't doubt the excellent quality of the offerings here, the end product is just not engaging enough to entice a return visit. Nice setting, nice folks, wish you well, need to consider upping the ante on taste.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>It was terrible. Bland salad, and overcooked bland Salmon. The Chicken Rigatoni Marsala sauce tasted like flour. We did not eat our entries, we left and went somewhere else. We were very disappointed. It was certainly not worth the drive from Placerville to check it out.</review>< Pics>

<Date>1552747926633<//Date><Rating>1<//Rating><text>Served spoiled scallops. Only ate one out of the three and told the waiter why. No comment or compensation. Tried to contact manager by phone and email but no response.
Waited an hour for entree’s. Waiter did not check on us or fill water glasses.
Three out of four entree’s were bland. The fourth entree was the scallops that smelled like ammonia. The cauliflower purée served with it was delicious and I would of liked to of had more of it.
The payment process is terrible and the waiter stands over you and waits until you are finished so the iPad is not left at the table (I’m assuming). Is there only one?
Did like location, ambiance and decor but question the ethics of chef and management, and food is not great so will not be back.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x809ae1dc36381589:0x946347b412a5b056< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Overpriced and disappointing. Loud and anything but cozy on a cold, rainy night. All four of our entrees were underwhelming, which were $15-30 each. At $200 including 4 entrees, 2 appetizers, 2 desserts, a $30 bottle of wine and tip, I’d rather spend a little more and celebrate a special occasion next door at Hawks.</text>

Frank and his team at Minuteman produced very sophisticated business cards. They were a dream to work with and now our go to printing service.

We chose raised spot gloss, suede finish in black, 16pt weight. Definitely worth opting for a premium card to make an impact.</review>

I have used various printers, however, Minuteman Press in Irvine, CA has proven to be the best. Be it customer service, willingness to do what it takes in order to satisfy the customer, and both Frank and Brad are really good and caring people. These days, the whole experience with designing my business card was terrific. Call them and you will soon see they are the best!<//Text>

What a great shop to work with! I was helped by Frank, who continuously responded to me quickly. I had a tight window of when I needed a large amount of things made. They finished it a week earlier then expected. Everything was perfect and exactly how we wanted. They have great prices for the high quality products. I’m already going to order more products from them. I highly recommend Minuteman Press for all business needs. Thanks Frank!! See you soon!< /text>

I have had the pleasure of working with Frank at Minuteman Press for several printing projects. Most recently, I needed to have some large window clings printed. Frank was very quick to respond and their turnaround for production was prompt. These window clings upgraded our look in terms of our building's branding, so many thanks to the Minuteman Press team in Irvine for this.<//Review>

<Review>Frank Matsumoto of Minuteman Press in Irvine, CA takes great pride in his attention to detail.

July of 2016, I volunteered to help a relative prepare for a celebration of life. She wanted to provide classy programs for the tables and did not have much time to acquire them.

Frank came through. He was very sensitive to the emotions running through my being as I brought in artwork. He was in almost constant contact, asking for verification that I approved of the copy and letting me know when I could pick up the printed material. Everything looked beautiful. I felt pleased knowing that I was able to ease the burden slightly for my relative in her time of need.< /Review>< resp>

Not only is Minuteman press fast and friendly but the quality of work is exceptional! I've had multiple transactions with this location and it's always been quality work in the right amount of time every time.

I've been in business for over a decade and rely on the quality of my product. I only get a quality product when I find a quality service like Minuteman press in Irvine because some of my work relies on quality prints and contracts. Thanks Minuteman press for your hard work to deliver a good product!<//Text>

<review>I have been using printers for over 30 years and these have been by far the best to work with. They respond quickly, are super friendly and helpful and the jobs come out beautiful. I highly recommend at least getting a quote from them before you have anything printed.< /review>< Pics>

Frank and Brad are absolutely fantastic to work with. They get each job done quickly and produce great quality work each time! They make a point to go out of their way to help us hit each of our deadlines. We couldn't be happier with the ongoing positive experience we have with this group!</text>

I am a busy Realtor in the Irvine area. When I need my flyers or my postcards done, I call Frank. I send him the PDF, and pick up my flyers the next day. I love the personalize service. I love that Frank knows who I am and I can’t even pick up my stuff after hours, once I’ve paid for it. Love knowing that my printing will be done professionally and exactly how I like it. I highly recommend this business!!!< /review>

<review>Not only is Minuteman press fast and friendly but the quality of work is exceptional! I've had multiple transactions with this location and it's always been quality work in the right amount of time every time.

I've been in business for over a decade and rely on the quality of my product. I only get a quality product when I find a quality service like Minuteman press in Irvine because some of my work relies on quality prints and contracts. Thanks Minuteman press for your hard work to deliver a good product!</review></record></dataset><record>

This place is GREAT! I had a last minute print job that i was rushing to get done and not only did they get it done fast it was better quality and cheaper than the other printer I had used in the past. The owner Frank even contacted me for a flyer I was printing to let me know that the color of the writing needed to be changed to stand out more. I really appreciate the fact that they took the time to contact me and let me make some edits rather than running off 500 copies and charging me for something I can't use. I will definitely be using this place for my future printing needs.< /text>

Excellent service.  A+++++++++ all around.  We didn't pick up on prints on time and even though they were closed, they sent someone to the store on their day off to get us our order.  Couldn't have been more impressed.  Thank you so much for everything.<//Text>

<Response>None< /Response><Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Unbelievable Customer Service.  That is how Frank and Brad at Minuteman Press Irvine Spectrum differentiate themselves from other printing services.  Their attention to detail on every order I submitted over the years was remarkable. These were training materials that required the assembly of many pieces.  They never complained about my rush orders and often would even drive an order to a local customer site to ensure on time delivery.  I moved out of the state so now more than ever, I realize how spoiled I was with their great service.  Thank you.<//Text>< date>

First time at lucky wheels but not the last. Everyone was very helpful and talkative. They have parts on hand but can order parts at a fair price as well. They have every tool under the sun including a sand blaster and various welders. They also offer oil and tire disposal for 5$.< /review>

<Text>Brought in a Vespa with a tire issue, fully prepared to drop a decent amount of money. They easily could have told me I needed to replace the whole tire, but instead showed me it was fine and didn't even charge me a diagnostic.

Lucky Wheels Garage is one of the coolest and most unique shops in America. It’s a DIY co-op style shop where, with a membership or day pass, you can wrench on your motorcycle projects. From welding and fabrication to general maintenance, LW has the tools and knowledgeable people ready to help.<//text>

If you want to work on your bike and don’t have the room or the tools, this is a perfect place for you. They have everything you could need and are incredibly helpful. Not to mention, there is amazing coffee two seconds to the left of LWG.<//Review>

<Text>This place is awesome, I love the concept of fixing it yourself. The cool part about it is that they Guide you along the way. I am new to the whole motorcycle maintenance so,They were able to break it down for me so that I could understand and fix The bike on my own. This was a plus for me because I didn't have to pay for a mechanic to do the labor. Repairing my bike only cost me $35,  had full access to equipment and tools< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Had to change a tire on the go, had it delivered from the big guys to lucky wheels garage a few days prior and even tho I never did that before I just had the best time, the crew will give you just enough hint and push so you really learn to take care of your bike!! AND I saved money.

Ever since they established themselves in Boyle Heights, there is a lot of noise from motorcycles riding back and forth on Mission Rd. Every night it goes on and car alarms turn on because of the bikes vibrations and they used to have loud parties with rock music on Saturdays, thank God they stopped. This is a residential neighborhood and I have a 2 month old baby who can’t sleep because of the noise. I am sure none of these guys would like it if somebody came to their neighborhood with this much noise.

Amazing community moto garage.  Pay a small monthly fee to access their tools, lifts, and machine shop.  Pretty much everything you need for DIY wrench work on your bike without having to buy an entire garage worth of equipment.  Awesome idea, awesome staff.< /Review>

This is one of worst stores I have ever visited. you would think Chocolate would be sweet. These people are rude and very dismissive. I waited for almost 20 minutes to get service. The manager was very dismissive.< /text>

GF suggested this place to get some desert after dinner. I ended up getting a super delicious chocolate coffee smoothie drink with whipped cream and chocolate. If you sign up for their online program you can get a free chocolate item every month. Definitely going to come back again next month.<//review>

I highly recommend their milk chocolate dipped Oreos if you are having an extreme sugar craving. Their truffles are also good, but be warned for these deserts are quite pricey so I don't frequent it as often as I would like. The staff is always friendly and if you join their rewards card they offer a free piece of candy per month which can save you a couple of bucks.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Nice customer service except I told the girl please no oreos in my ice cream I'm gluten intolerant. Her co worker decided to help her out and guess what? Filled up my ice cream with oreos. Sad part was I did not notice till o hit the midpoint of the cup< /Review>

Very grateful to find this museum.

Collections ~ Grounds and collections were very immersive. Lots of hidden gems. Curator's notes surrounded artifacts and models / casts with ample context. Top to bottom exploring "in detail" I spent about 4 hours here and enjoyed every minute. But if your party has ~2hr or less I think it would still be worth it and you can cover most exhibits.

Experience ~ A volunteer gave a brief tour and at the time of this review C19 guidelines were in effect. Everyone in museum and all staff were mindful. Very clean and not too crowded if you go in the early half of day.

Tip: Rose Garden is also close by, great place to go after. GPS will take you to the front, but make 2 Lefts after and you'll see signage for parking lot.</text>

Definitely bringing a picnic next time I visit so I can enjoy the soothing atmosphere longer. Staff is courteous and informative and the exhibits are very well layed out.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuQPmiCddWKRP4-IL5Mq6jZKuF7x-mrg45q7_1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOFINd4w1qNyQFst-a4lMKBccWbYEHRo3QSnzD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOU5jfJV8U6m_euO6XocROLR-zm34ITBuqSG6XF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWutvzZ6m8xpEAxSbromzuEXkj9cF4wR-uumPa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMm70N6zEZq2n4w1kcSMQ0WJeh1P_mlRZLa5giW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9MGhiVzg5tcZnC5i9_a-zwO4GUqAHl9vwtbuW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbtiwEnsyklWvb0h28EsuUssAIyXI6TRKG-xv_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzkn13C4xlGiPE-zzVTDYqZGdncyNVA2vRA-9z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-OIKxlSd5FQjIeEQua93TxE4z3XCha1mZQoJk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxAcpDqMc0KiP_AhyA9Qeb3QMHC-qqBfh3bjhH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOTrHEmLqBY23jPIv9UmhDiMBrxmC1rtE8Qe5x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNANvPxCMJsx10g4ZSmEHysBo1sCypQIAuFOaN1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7gW1fHowPJWXkl_17KYcbOI_AB_xQQu00SHEc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMmcPKsmycfdgYiX65tNK1XE58pud-_VPfF5ap=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRpn8KtcvpRKqesnyZW-JYrN5m9Nk8RrFfBk-G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORsqv6dMNkbIf5Q7lll6cssW8PS10qSTLDSEeI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPViELsRKn-SYyYDNao7jmxBBX2Pjo3QJ_QwrBR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZDcUWHrQsaSNE64dgZj51MBEf9F-Ze9orn33Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808fcb6b68eb46d5:0x813b70ab82510592< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Everyone who works here is incredibly welcoming and happy to answer any questions. I would highly recommend using their application when touring the galleries. I plan on returning with a membership so I can explore each gallery.<//Text>< Pictures>

Nice museum about Egyptian history, art, traditions.  It takes 1.5 hour for a quick walkthrough and 2-3 hours if you read all the descriptions or take a audio tour. Most staff are nice except one young lady with short hair at the front desk. I feel discrimination with her rude behaviors.<//review>

<text>Unfortunately, the museum is really lacking in organization. Rather than being slowly introduced to Egypt and a timeline of history, it immediately dumps you into a random collection of statues and replica artifacts.

Additionally, even though every display case contains a bunch items to view, they are accompanied with a large paragraph of text. Though that's nice at first, it ultimately amounts to a thesis worth of reading.< /text>< user_name>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>One of my favorite museums of all time. It's deceptively large, and has so much depth.
Kid friendly, accessible, good for social distancing.
I highly recommend visiting, even if you only have an hour or two. $10 for an adult ticket is an amazing deal for an incredible museum, especially compared to other tourist destinations in SJ.

(The tomb walkthrough is INCREDIBLE.)

I always wish I had all day to wander the property, as the gardens are so gorgeous as well.   They even gave us free tickets to visit again this year as we left.
What an awesome place.< /Review><Date>1621802170372</Date><resp>None<//resp>< pictures>

<Review>4.5 stars! Great museum at a fair price! Lots to see and discover! Only issue is there aren't rest benches in the museum. There's a lot to see so pretty soon your legs start to get tired. Especially not great if you have a disability.<//Review>< Time>

Very nice museum.   There are both original artifacts (including mummies) as well as replicas of more famous pieces (the Rosetta Stone, the Code of Hamurrabi and more).   It is small, but there is a lot to see and learn about.   Admission is quite reasonable, and it is close to the rose garden.   Well worth a visit.</text>

Wow, just wow. This place was super interesting with all of the artifacts. The outdoor area was in a word stunning. The history on display here is truly awe inspiring and takes you on a journey through time. The staff were very welcoming and informative. So much to see inside and out. The front walkway gave you a tiny insight to what your mind would be opened up to in a few moments. This place could easily take a couple days to see everything in its entirety. Thank you, when I am back in town I will be coming back for sure as I know I only saw the tip of the iceberg on our first visit.<//Text>

The building is beautiful and the garden outside. They have so many different artifacts and curated rooms and multiple mummies and sarcophagus that you can see up close. I visited this museum about 5-6 years ago and I still think about how cool it is. I hope to be able to look around again some day.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Positives were that a lot of the interior displays were really interesting, also the exterior landscaping is awesome. The labyrinth will surprise you for not having tall walls. I would label it more of a succulent path. My favorite part was going into a tomb like tunnel that took you to the next section.

Negatives were that some of the interior displays seem outdated and once you enter the main lobby and visit overall musty smell.</Review><response>None<//response>< username>

Gardens are very zen. A great place to relax and enjoy the scenery, sunshine and meet others doing the same!  Wear your masks :)<//Text>

<Review>This is a really awesome place and a must visit. Firstly it not very visible they should do something about that. Once inside its really amazing how many exhibits they have on display. They have divided the entire museum into several sections all of them with their own significance. All the exhibits have detailed explanation. You should have at-least an hour to browse through all of them. The ticket is $9 but worth it. They have discounted rates for Seniors, Military, Students. The staff there is super helpful.< /Review>< pictures>

I’m so glad we decided to visit. The museum only costs $9 each for adults, and that is really such a low price considering it took about 2.5 hours to get through, and we did two extra workshops/tours. Everyone working here is friendly and the tour guide, Robert, was so intelligent and enthusiastic. It was family friendly but there are mummified bodies so kids may get a little freaked out. You could easily just avoid those galleries though. I highly recommend checking this place out!<//Text>

I love this place, have found childhood memories of the museum.  Its chock full of great Egyptian artifacts,  the gardens and buildings are beautiful.  It dates from the mid 1920's and it's a nice day visit. The surrounding neighborhoods are very quaint and cute< /text>

<Text>Great place. Very educational. Lots of great content and artifacts. Great for kids. Has a Garden and planetarium. I give it a 10 star...

If you are up north in Cali stop on by. You will be happy you did.

<text>Amazing museum! General admission is as low as $9.- and on top of that you can watch free shows and get free tours. The gardens behind the museum are also just amazing! The museum has so many awesome things: mummies, a walk through a tomb, miniature displays of both the daily life for people in Egypt as well as miniature displays of building structures. Honestly this place is even better than Winchester mansion!!! My friends and I spend 3 hours at this museum and the gardens and all yesterday. I definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling through San Jose, it’s a one of a kind must see. Side information: We parked the car on a free public parking lot across the street, 5 min walk. The museum is wheelchair accessible, kids are free, with your triple A card you can get a discount, showings are at 2 pm and also 3:30 pm in the weekend, the museum has lockers and all building have bathrooms.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMivkUblOrTDtgwttQFQt0qamM5dZ9USvdDJ0Ce=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGmUkT94b0z2XWt1WN7ZK4_BSlCHUfFtS38F_G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnJGgq2QPd60ga1KqL6LKPTk5k8RTfm3BYPr44=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrNfUEJlrYdLPEj6Wfz1jGSvhsQAyBmg74cwO7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgKYbwDvgnN_mxpmiKoJA4K3p2bY3f8kErR8Lt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUWaZbI3CpqQk_POUXsILlD01pwK4s4AtguBfB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQjboMxW4IbVPOXIfKoJM1FtG0t8hI6JbkncUA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpH34gnzTwKSFGOgr01pZPlOjbcL0ADugcSsHc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4J4-LRIRdIpqFyuQzccomWIT0O7dnSAAfnGol=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM91RxjESkC8ZAZn8ETQz5qHyIQ5ezVNiSaGQlp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyxUACe2t1BMZU4jR62JN9s0VyEHSPcgJtEveA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi1KwwSKcyt7Rbb918Nu5_6KhHQPKD-_cciHkO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

From the outside, museum does not look like it is as LARGE as it actually is on the inside. The place is huge! There are different levels so put on your walking shoes. Many stairs to go up and down on.  But there is a electric ramp for wheelchair or walker accessibility. There were a lot of people and many had brought their children,  some seemed a little bored a lot seemed to have fun. From dieties, to actual mummified people,  to beadwork,  pieces from the tombs, and of course sarcophagus room.  Give at least 2 hours, 3 if you decide to do one of the weekend workshops that are given-look on the website to find out which one is being given. There is also a lybrynth behind the building that you can walk and meditate with. There is also a separate planetarium but right now it is closed for renovations.<//Text>

Wow, just wow. This place was super interesting with all of the artifacts. The outdoor area was in a word stunning. The history on display here is truly awe inspiring and takes you on a journey through time. The staff were very welcoming and informative. So much to see inside and out. The front walkway gave you a tiny insight to what your mind would be opened up to in a few moments. This place could easily take a couple days to see everything in its entirety. Thank you, when I am back in town I will be coming back for sure as I know I only saw the tip of the iceberg on our first visit.< /text>

Despite being small, the displays were very interactive and informative (it felt like we were transported into the Egyptian civilisation). Displays were also easy to understand and not too over the top, making it universal for all age groups. Overall, this is definitely a must-see in my book!</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOLin-ekXLjQFLq_awOt9xnrQxz8EYnWR5uKXt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMu-uJ4dcAV8-ARVEWK99K_f80mUtMKtf6m3D7y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPh1_zkFRrmw3quWqDO4L7AuckUWBlgbbs5kAjL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPKN8XVuZszOhFb7Y4MAJorKtJ68_qcJOB0AVm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

The museum was built to represent the Egyptian buildings. There were a lot of artifacts and with lots of detail.

The service was really good. They have this tour where they bring you inside a tomb and they will explain everything in the guided tour. They are also there to answer any questions if you're curious.

Definitely a place to visit if you're interested in Egyptian history!< /Text>

This place is amazing if you enjoy Egyptian history. The grounds are beautiful. The only minuses are lack of food and a gift shop. It would have been nice to find videos or books on sale to further the experience</review>

It was the first time I saw an original mummy. I did not have any idea of visiting the place. I just dropped in there.
Wow it was an amazing experience for me. Everybody in the staff was friendly. informative. Helpful. Many artefacts with real value can be seen here. The instructors explain the way the mummies are processed in very attractive way.  Must visit place if You come to San Jose.</text>

One of the best museums I’ve ever visited! Despite being small, the displays were very interactive and informative (it felt like we were transported into the Egyptian civilisation). Displays were also easy to understand and not too over the top, making it universal for all age groups. Overall, this is definitely a must-see in my book!<//Text>

Tells the story of Egypt from the start to the end, artifacts displayed nicely, information detailed. We loved wandering through and learning so much more than we thought we had known. Highly suggest a visit to spend a couple of hours!</Text>< pics>

This is absolutely one of my favorite places in San Jose. I come here whenever I'm in The Bay area. It's beautiful inside and out so you can check out the exhibitions or just walk around the gardens.< /text>

This is a pretty amazing place if you like Egyptian artifacts. Extremely reasonably priced. The grounds are gorgeous as are the buildings. They have a planetarium (a separate fee but still reasonable). Plus they have a replica of a tomb that you can walk through! Very much worth a visit or two!</text>

The service was really good. They have this tour where they bring you inside a tomb and they will explain everything in the guided tour. They are also there to answer any questions if you're curious.

Definitely a place to visit if you're interested in Egyptian history!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObfNftvUO6qPlhCdgMNO2QlJwLbRm6YgLKiDYe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz1ntxz4D7BRvO9mxZ3kfiKwqaQr-0XEpseTiw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

From the outside, museum does not look like it is as LARGE as it actually is on the inside. The place is huge! There are different levels so put on your walking shoes. Many stairs to go up and down on.  But there is a electric ramp for wheelchair or walker accessibility. There were a lot of people and many had brought their children,  some seemed a little bored a lot seemed to have fun. From dieties, to actual mummified people,  to beadwork,  pieces from the tombs, and of course sarcophagus room.  Give at least 2 hours, 3 if you decide to do one of the weekend workshops that are given-look on the website to find out which one is being given. There is also a lybrynth behind the building that you can walk and meditate with. There is also a separate planetarium but right now it is closed for renovations.<//text>

Great little museum near the Rose Garden.
Displays are informative and attractive but a little dark in places.
There are all sort of side rooms and a tomb mock up, so it's worth going when you have more time than we had.< /text>

Interesting museum with a wide range of different types of egyptian artifacts.   Apparently, it's the largest collection west of the Mississippi River.  I have no way to verify that, but it is a hidden gem in the South Bay.   Also, there is a very nice garden that surrounds the museum, so leave some time for that.<//Review>

Dark as a cave but definitely worth a visit! Adult tickets are $10, student with ID is $7, and there's a AAA price of $9. I spent almost 3 hours here so I think it's 100% worth the price. There's a really cool replica of a tomb, it's very dark and the floor is uneven so watch your step! There's a lot of Ancient Egyptian artifacts and various replicas as well. The placards are very informative. Preserve the artifacts; be careful not to use flash photography!</Text>

I used my ID card to get the student price for the museum entry ($7) which was nice.

The place is beautiful to look at from the outside. It has Egyptian style structures on all 4 sides of the museum.

The exhibit is really good with so many original items (note that some will be remakes of the original). But the lighting is a bit dull inside which doesn't let you stay interested. I had a tough time being active and reading the information. But few of the exhibits are interactive and those are nice to see.

Overall this is a one time visit, you will like it more if you become with probably an excited kid.< /text>

Walking the grounds alone is a great way to spend the day. It was beautiful even in the winter.<//text>

Dedicated to the knowledge.  No gift shop 👍. And a beautiful garden with exotic plants. Didn't see the planetarium but I'm sure it would have been awesome.</Text>

<Text>Wow, like 9 areas to check out.  Egyptian artifacts,  real mummies,  history glorious!   Free parking in back across the street.   Plan on spending at least a few hours to see everything and take it all in.  No snack bar inside or anything like that.   Not even a gift shop but definitely watch the video as you enter to get a better understanding of the rosicrutean society.< /Text>< Pics>

At first I had my doubts, but ended up spending the whole afternoon there. They have 3 floors worth of Egyptian history. From their day to day artifacts to an actual mommy. Had a guided tour of the replica tomb which was fascinating. They also have a pretty Egyptian style garden in the back. Planetarium tickets are free too.< /text>< pics>

<Review>It’s not a big museum, but quite nice. We liked the tunnel - dark Egyptian rooms. We have a 3-year-old, so it was a bit boring for him. Good museums are those that have something to play and interact with! Some faux sarcophagus that you could go into or any other games would be great.<//Review>< userid>

<Review>- Guided tours
- Can be walked within 2hrs.
- Reasonably priced

When you arrive right in front is the admissions desk. The price for two adults was $16 with a AAA discount applied. The staff was very friendly,  nice and knowledgeable. You can walk around the galleries in any order. The are about six galleries in all. The gardens outside are beautiful. Overall a wonderful museum!<//Review>< pictures>

We loved this place, though it could use some modern updates. Only $8/person or less if you're in the military or in education. Sooo much information and perfect for an Egypt enthusiastic. Definitely join the guided tours they offer. We listened to one on jewelry and it was very interesting. Also the Alchemy exhibit was fascinating. Very sad they didn't have a gift shop, though.<//review>

We weren't able to go inside, but the gardens around the building we're very nice to walk through. There are a lot of nice structures to look at as well. The Peace Garden was especially nice.<//text>

It's a museum that wouldn't bore the museum-haters.. plenty of photo-ops both inside and outside to keep them from cribbing.. and interesting information for those who do check out the exhibits! Worth a visit, if you live in or visit San Jose!</text>

<user_id>114351763890828011977</user_id><review>Well curated collection, but could use better upkeep.

There's free parking at the back of the museum compound, a decent entrance fee (generous discounts available).

There had been much to learn and be amazed at. My favorite part was the underground walkway that made one feel what it's like to walk through an Egyptian tomb.

The building is dated, and the grounds look like they only get a cursory manicure every now and then, but it's easy to see how beautiful it all was (and could still be). The pond in the Peace Garden had some healthy koi inhabitants.

Would love to come back and see the museum in a polished and renovated state.</review><rate>4<//rate>< Name>

Had a great time here. My daughter is obsessed with Eygpt and she was fascinated walking through the museum and seeing what was there. It was a very educational and fun day.

I wish the planetarium experience was better. It was a let down.< /text>

Educational, with good displays and knowledgeable staff. Delightful, Egyptian tomb recreation. While you need to pay to visit the museum, the grounds are free to explore. Lovely fountain. Serene​ reflecting pool and lovely plantings interspersed with early twentieth century replicas of ancient Egypt. Great for meditation and quiet walks.</text>

Great artifacts, interesting things to see! The museum needs some updates, it looks like it hasn't seen a major update since the 80's. Also, it would be helpful if there was a suggested route so that the people would flow in a natural way through the exhibits, for now it's a free for all and is confusing. Also there is so much information that it is overwhelming, there has got to be hundreds of thousands of words describing every little detail of every tiny artifact, its great to have that info, but too much for the average tourist.  Overall satisfied, it just needs some updates to make it more receptive to the modern museum goer.</review>

It looks a little corny from the outside but their collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts is like none I've ever seen before.  The museum is very well organized and there is so much to see.  It's super reasonably priced and there's an actual replica of a tomb!  It's a must-see if you're in the San Jose area.< /text>< pics>

Bountious lore and exhibitions on ancient history. The outside garden has been well-cared for and the outside architecture has some Masonic flair.</Text>

Everything here is really well kept and clean. They have a lot of replicas of the real artifacts. Only a few real artifacts were here. That's why not the 5* as I was hopping that everything is the real deal. Still close enough. Would not go again and glad didn't pay the 9$.<//text>< user>

<name>Lahta Stephens</name><Review>This museum is worth going out of the way for if you find yourself in San Jose. It's bigger than I thought it would be for a suburban museum and covers more than anicent Egyptians - there's also Babylonians and Alchemy thrown in the mix too.
One odd thing is that Rosicrucians were behind setting up this museum, so expect a low key promotion of Rosicrucian ideals and beliefs when you go.<//Review>< user_id>

It’s not a big museum, but quite nice. We liked the tunnel - dark Egyptian rooms. We have a 3-year-old, so it was a bit boring for him. Good museums are those that have something to play and interact with! Some faux sarcophagus that you could go into or any other games would be great.< /Review>

They have around 3 actual mummified remains on display and many sarcophagus and artifacts from ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. A truly educational experience in archeological history. The staff here were super helpful and even helped us out with a few pennies for the souvenir machine !! The planetarium has a show every weekday at 2 pm. Weekend timings are different with multiple shows. There's not much propaganda about the Rosicrucian order but they have a mini library inside to read up. Parking is on adjacent streets. They could perhaps benefit from having a gift shop inside. Overall a great place to spend half a day in San Jose.< /review><user_id>102853881244673541075< /user_id>< Pictures>

- Guided tours
- Can be walked within 2hrs.
- Reasonably priced

When you arrive right in front is the admissions desk. The price for two adults was $16 with a AAA discount applied. The staff was very friendly,  nice and knowledgeable. You can walk around the galleries in any order. The are about six galleries in all. The gardens outside are beautiful. Overall a wonderful museum!< /text>

For the low price of the ticket I spent at least 2 hours walking amongst gods learning about the daily lives of ancient people and examining ancient artifacts.  Spectacular gem of San Jose which needs more support and some updating.</text>

Well curated collection, but could use better upkeep.

There's free parking at the back of the museum compound, a decent entrance fee (generous discounts available).

There had been much to learn and be amazed at. My favorite part was the underground walkway that made one feel what it's like to walk through an Egyptian tomb.

The building is dated, and the grounds look like they only get a cursory manicure every now and then, but it's easy to see how beautiful it all was (and could still be). The pond in the Peace Garden had some healthy koi inhabitants.

Would love to come back and see the museum in a polished and renovated state.< /Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>This museum is worth going out of the way for if you find yourself in San Jose. It's bigger than I thought it would be for a suburban museum and covers more than anicent Egyptians - there's also Babylonians and Alchemy thrown in the mix too.
One odd thing is that Rosicrucians were behind setting up this museum, so expect a low key promotion of Rosicrucian ideals and beliefs when you go.< /text>< pics>

<Response>None</Response><Text>There may be several museums in and around most large cities, but museums with authentic mummies and artifacts over 3000 years old are very uncommon.

The Rosicrucian museum is a relatively small museum in size, but it has the largest collection of Egyptian artifacts in the whole of western North America. The ticket prices are very competitive and are cheaper than most museums in the Bay Area. Even better - the last 1 hour is completely free on the weekends! Parking is limited but free as well.</Text>< GmapID>

I absolutely loved this museum! There were so many pieces, the theming and flow was intelligently laid out, and the staff there were ready and responsive to my questions.  The alchemy exhibit upstairs was really interesting, and the way that it was laid out spoke to the passion of the curators.

The grounds that the museum are on are some of the most tranquil, relaxing examples of native species and relaxation gardening that I've seen.< /review>

I began visiting this museum as an elementary school student and as an adult it is still awesome! Though I live out of town now, I had a few hours between appointments in San Jose and decided to revisit the museum. I was so impressed by the polite and helpful staff as well as the exhibits and information provided. I spent a few delightful hours wandering around the museum. I highly recommend this site for a visit, no matter your age!<//Text>

Very impressed by the quantity of artifacts they have here. The main attractions are the Mummies. However, the museum is fairly large and has many areas to explore on the outside as well. Will definitely be coming back again.<//Review>

<time>1582053202038< /time><rating>5< /rating><text>Really cool exhibits, each detailed with explanations of everthing inside. A lot to see, three stories of exhibits, artifacts, and models. We were really impressed with the life size tomb that you can take a free self-tour through once inside the museum. Ample parking on the side streets. Also cool that they try to get you a discount if you are a student, AAA member, etc. Definitely worth it for the value and also for the gardens and planitarium around the outside of the museum. A must-go if you are in the area.<//text>< Pictures>

<username>Rohan Jay<//username><Text>Found this hidden gem in the midst of downtown San Jose. Honestly I was surprised to find so much information on the Egyptian culture and history there. They also have this really beautiful garden outside, called Peace garden with a lot of plant diversity around the area. The planetarium was closed for renovation but the whole place in general is worth spending time especially with family or kids.</Text>< pics>

Beautiful Ancient Egyptian Museum that has been here for decades. Much has been done to keep this museum relevant. The thousands of ancient Egyptian artifacts, mummies and a tomb replica make this the best such place on the West coast! The gardens are beautiful but I'd recommend picnicking at the nearby San Jose Rose Garden.<//Text>

The garden is very nice. Perfect place to have a walk during weekend especially in the morning. I saw a lot of couples walking and talking pictures around the swamp and the building. Sometimes there are fish and beautiful flowers, you can see pomegrates and grapes. There are also 3 tables with chars under a very old tree, perfect to take a rest< /Text>

Well worth the price of admission - rooms upon rooms of treasures. Plan on taking the time to stroll thru the gardens as well as seeing the superb collection of artifacts.</review>

I was last there over 15 years ago.  They have greatly expanded their collection since then.  The descriptions of what is in the display cases is very informative.  Be sure to check out the gardens as well.  Plan on a few hours when you go.<//Review>

<Review>I came here for a field trip in my junior high(Dartmouth Middle) school, and was, well, delighted to see an ACTUAL mummy(though you could smell the rotten bones through the glass, which was unfortunate) and some more mummies, and a life size model of what a pyramid would look like, which was really cool but also scary(I'm pretty sure that the life size pyramid is only accessible by the groups or classes with the guides). Overall, it was really nice and detailed.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><username>mango</username>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The tomb tour was very well done and my favorite part. The tour guide was very engaging and knowledgable. The tomb is based off multiple real life mummy tombs and the level of detail was awesome to look at. It really conveyed a narrative and did a great job displaying the rituals and concepts of the Ancient Egyptians' death rites. Outside of the tomb, all the exhibits were well put together and contained fascinating details and objects from the Egyptians' daily life. It's a small museum, but well worth a visit.<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

<Name>Anna< /Name><text>Outdoor area is serene , well kept, and beautiful. Admission fee is under 10 pp. There is a tour guide or you can walk yourself. We did self guided for about 10 minutrs then joined a group. It was very informative. The sarcophagus are incredible. There's several different areas to view. You can also do the planetarium if it's open. The staff is friendly and the bathrooms were spotless.

My family went here yesterday and we had a fantastic time at Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum! We had no problem parking our car since they have a parking space available and the admission is very affordable! There are lots of sights here such as the mummies, artifacts, an Egyptian tomb, miniature displays of Egyptians and building structures in Egypt.  Outside, they had outdoor art with a fountain and labyrinth, a very relaxing walking space with the kids. We would definitely come back here if we had a chance.< /review>

<review>If you love ancient history you absolutely have to visit this museum. The displays are laid out in chronological order. Very interesting and educational. There is so much information available it is impossible to see it all in one day. It was well worth the $9.00 addmission price($7.00 for senior citizens).< /review><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I love this museum!! I do, however, miss the gift shop. Being able to get postcards of a museum, or cards, is how I like to remember  and also share with others.<//Text>

<Text>Their shrunken heads are really creepy! We loved our visit here. The mummy with hair and a shriveled up tongue intact was fascinating and gross. On the educational side, our family always has appreciated anything archaeological, so there was a great deal to keep us engaged with the exhibits, learning and having a great time. They offer museum tours, garden tour and a planetarium! From a sociological perspective, there is much to see and learn about ancient Egypt, whether in a group, solo, couples or with children. There are also programs for learning, including a junior archaeological program and more.Their outside park has a temple and labyrinth so there also are outdoor activities that will provide the young (and young at heart) and energetic with a lot of fun. Their gift shop had the best rose scented incense I have ever experienced. There will be enough oddities here to keep the whole group engaged. They offer free admission for the last hour, but one hour is not enough to experience all that is offered in this fantastic, curious, creepy and exciting venue< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808fcb6b68eb46d5:0x813b70ab82510592< /gmapID></record>

Went here as a kid on a field trip and had such an amazing trip I came back with a friend recently. The museum has a recreation of a tomb that you can walk into as well as countless artifacts and recreations from ancient Egypt. This place has some activities for kids,  but it is a lot of reading so young children may be bored after a while. The grounds of the museum are beautiful and peaceful to walk through,  and the municipal rose gardens are a block away.  This is a very unique and special place and if you love museums and learning about other cultures,  this place is a wonderful experience!</review>

Amazing place, One trip is not enough if you really want to soak in all the knowledge this place has, The staff are very friendly and enthusiastic, The Egyptian exhibits are amazing, they fill you with wonder and awe and you start appreciating this ancient civilization, the museum gives you a glimpse of almost every aspect of ancient Egyptian civilization; daily life, religion, crafts, royal affairs, architecture, agriculture and of course beliefs of afterlife.. great place to spend the weekend with kids. Do not miss the free planetarium show and the library</review>

<review>The staff is very nice. Two displays no longer have functioning lights. I kind of feel like the hole tour experience needs a bit of a makeover. It's been the same sort of factual, informational presentation for many years. It would be great if they can integrate some technology or even have a component on a cell phone that students might be able to follow along with like bar codes to scan for information.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>Been wanting to come here for years and it was beautiful. My favorite part of the museum was actually the alchemy section- which was a surprise to me! All of the Egyptian artifacts were fantastic and I learned a lot. They had so many cool artifacts I had never seen before as well!

<text>Surprisingly fun! I went on a rainy Super Bowl Sunday, and it was a nice outing. I'd go again on a sunny day to spend more time strolling around the gardens - I think there's also a rose garden nearby that's supposed to be lovely. The museum itself is pretty informative and a relatively good price considering how much time you can spend there. Some of the items are replicas, so just keep that in mind. However, there are some genuine archeological finds here, which is pretty cool.< /text>< Pics>

The museum is amazing, what a great surprise to find in the San Jose!

Taken off one star due to zero ramps inside the facility. If you have a stroller or wheelchair, you will have a difficult time moving between floors. This museum is not ADA compliant. There is also no place to park strollers.

Again, the museum is great!< /Review>

I love the Rosicrucian museum! My father in law was a Rosicrucian and I grew up down the street from the San Jose facility. The building is old and has a LOT of stairs. They have chair lifts to get you around BUT if you're in a 350 pound power wheelchair and you weigh 201 pounds you are not going to be able to go because there's a 550 pound weight limit.</Review>

This place needs some serious updating. The outside is really cool and well maintained but the inside is a different story. Feels like you're going back into the 60s when you walk in. The artifacts are decent enough.<//review>

The amount of artifacts they've been able to stuff into this little museum is surprising. There is a lot to see here - and be prepared to do a lot of reading! The displays are very informative, but it's overwhelming to wander the displays and try to read every description.</Review>

Had a lovely time with my 12yr old son! He already knew a lot about the culture and people's, thoroughly enjoyed schooling me in the details of their gods, goddesses,  and rituals. The conducted TOMB TOUR is a must👍
Highly recommended for kids and adults 🖖< /text>

Well worth the price of admission - rooms upon rooms of treasures. Plan on taking the time to stroll thru the gardens as well as seeing the superb collection of artifacts.< /Text>

Surprising good museum. An excellent collection that has unique pieces and delivers everything with a fun and interesting tone (some of the curator notes are unexpectedly hilarious). The tomb recreation is neat and you can add on a planetarium show to round out the day. We were there 3 hours and didn't quite finish or get bored. I had to drag my wife out while they were trying to lock up.< /Text>

<text>Worth a trip. The lighting is awful in this place and feels a bit disorganized. I do like the retro feel of it all but it would be nice to spruce it up a bit. Some items looked like they were sitting in water... but when we pointed it out they said it was glue. Why such poor gluemen skills? This stuff is irreplaceable.</text>< Name>

Really enjoyed this tranquil place in the midst of a big city. The only drawback was we went on Easter Sunday and it was closed for the interior exhibits. My bad for not checking the schedule. However just wondering around the outside with the Landscaping the buildings was a treat in itself. Can't wait to go back and see the exhibits inside.< /review>

<Review>This is a very cool museum.  We thought it would just be one building but is an entire complex.  Outside there is a peace garden, a temple and a labyrinth (it's tiny and cute).  Inside are multiple rooms covering Egypt, some Babylonian and some Sumerian artifacts.  They also have a recreation of a tomb that is very cool!  We went as part of a voluntary extracurricular trip with a few teachers and some students.  It was more fun than I expected.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcb6b68eb46d5:0x813b70ab82510592</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>A very good museum, filled with a wide variety of mostly Egyptian artifacts. There are a lot of  very well  done reproductions, for  example of the Rosetta Stone, which are unusual to see in a museum but which are fascinating and informative. The variety of things and the manageable size make this an excellent place to spend an hour or two, especially with kids who like museums. Some of the exhibits need to be fixed up, and are showing their age.< /text></record></dataset><record>

A little bit of history in our very own south Bay. I highly suggest this for people interested in Egypt who live here. It is not something to go to as a short term tourist. Do check out the outdoor gardens of this museum. There's also a beautiful rose garden nearby to chill after the visit.<//review>

It has quite an impressive collection, with both original egyptian artifacta , replicas of actual artifacta and artistic renditions of well known artifacta. It's true it's not the British museum, or another bigger museum but the staff are CLEARLY dedicated to their work, were unfailingly pleasant, patient and helpful. This museum is a definite labour of love. It's  not the poshest but it's  definitely deserving of patronage. They do need a gift shop though.<//Text>

What a gem!!!  It's such a treat to have this in the middle of this concrete jungle!  It's not that big of a museum,  but it's a very well put together.   And it really is truly an Egyptian museum.   All their artifacts and displays are Egyptian things or of Egypt (sometimes museums have some things from other cultures or other part of the world to fill some space).  Even the outside area was such a delight!  The peace garden outside really do give you a sense of serenity!  What a find!!!< /text>

The cool, but corny decoration at the entrance made me feel at first that we were going to find only replicas and more corny stuff inside. But the collection is big and most of the pieces are really from Egypt. The few replicas were molded from real pieces and, so, are very trustworthy. The guided visit to the tomb replica worth it a lot. The workshop to learn some hieroglyphs was really cool. Do it if you have a chance. It is a must go if you are near San Jose.<//Text>

The scenery outside of the museum is beautiful.  All the flowers and statues are really intriguing.  If you go to the garden there is tons of plants and a big pond in the back with beautiful fish.  Inside if you just wanna browse they always have info next to the artifact.  If you are interested in a class they have classes they announce for kids and adults to learn about things like perfume,  cosmetics,  and even mummification. Overall I think the museum is a great place for learning students or family's.</Review>

It's full of rare treasures which aren't even marked in a prominent manner. Eg the cylinder seal of Nebuchadnezzar II which I've only read about but not seen. It's one of four in existence only. Free WiFi in the museum and there's an audio tour/app. There's a guided tour of a tomb replica and a session on how to play the game Senet. All good fun and worth doing. You'll appreciate the tomb exhibit more if you do the tour because it is dark and hard to see in there and there are no labels in there to explain what you are looking at. There are mummies with skeletons inside! There's even a mummified catfish.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>A little piece of Egypt right here in San Jose.

I first discovered the Rosicrucian when I went on a field trip there many years ago. It sparked my live of Egypt and history, and really brought it all to life.

If you love Egypt and history, or just museums then you'll enjoy the Rosicrucian. They have mummies, and artifacts, models, and a tomb. There's gardens and tours. It's like stepping into another world and time.</Review>< UserId.>

Really cool museum with a reasonable entry fee, and a free planetarium. This museum has such a unique architecture, landscape, and location in the midst of a bustling downtown school zone. Really interesting place! There was a lot information, which was overwhelming, but overall a nice experience.< /text>

I was surprised by the quality and abundance of the artifacts. Super friendly staff. Could be a little better maintained but it’s well worth a trip. History buffs should plan to spend some time. Bring a lunch and eat on the grounds outside. Also has Mesopotamian artifacts and a lounge are with sofas and books to read. Loved it.< /text>

This is a very quirky and cool museum! My mom and I visited all of the antiquities sites in Egypt, many years ago, and they are better, but if you want to see some Egyptian antiquities without a major trip, this is pretty cool. They have mummies, and even have a tomb!<//review>

< review>
I've always driven past this museum and recently took my mom to explore this museum.  We were both happy to have visited the museum.  In a very compact footprint, there are multiple levels of displays and artifacts.

One thing to note if you have difficulty walking that I didn't notice any elevators, rather something to a motorized stair chair.

This was not available when I visited, but there is a tomb tour on certain days that people have mentioned is something worth seeing.

Parking is at the back of the museum.

Admission discounts for AAA members and others. Check the website.< /review>

<text>This museum is great. It's a great place to take your children so that they can see the way Egypt lived. The tomb tour is extremely interesting and it's very educational. I learned so many things I had never heard about ancient Egypt. I was amazed by the way of life. The displays are really interesting as well. The garden outside of the museum is also wonderful. There are lots of great photo opportunities as well. My 8 year old enjoyed his time there and us adults did so as well.<//text>< Pictures>

My boyfriend and I recently moved to San Jose and we thought it would be cool to do something new.  My boyfriend is facinated with Egyptian history. We spent a good 2 hours there.  There were a few children there and the staff did a good job to make sure it was quiet and the visitors were being very courteous to everyone.  It is probably a place you would only go once because I'm not sure how much they have new exhibits.<//text>

<Text>Was a great private museum with the service and experience of a large public museum.  The Indiana Jones exploring of a tomb was amazing.  Quantity of exhibits surprised me.  My daughter loved it too, and didn't want to leave.  You can spend the whole day there.  Good education on Rosicrucians.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I live locally and went on a rainy day, but really I should go more often. The artifacts are outstanding and displays easy to walk through, some of the paneling is old and outdated but to be honest I'm whining. Remember this is a private museum, so with what they have is spectacular. They do a great job balancing the grandeur with every day life of ordinary people, what they did, how they lived, how women gave birth, games they played. What I also appreciated where the artifacts on the Assyrian culture, an often overlooked people in ancient civilization that is still thriving well in the Bay Area!

This is a cool museum that I discovered as a friend told me about it. It's tucked away in a residential neighborhood, near a Botanical Garden. The outside is nicely lined with statues, looks quite regal. They have a garden as well. A lot of history and great artifacts. It was surprisingly big. You can easily spend a couple of hours. There was a lot information, which was overwhelming, but overall a nice experience.< /review>

It was fun to find this little spot in the middle of the high tech companies.  It took you back to the old times and the tour guide was very good.  However, the facility is not very disable friendly.  Two hours is all you need at this place.</Text>

You get a lot for your money! We spent a couple hours and I learned a lot from the museum. The buildings architecture is beautiful outside too! I only removed a star because the outdoor garden could use some work... but maybe they do that in the summer! Deff recommend!</Review>

For me to spend 5 hours in this museum, seemed like 3, to see the Egyptian artifacts, view their video, and visit the Peace Garden at the end of my visit of the museum was a fitting end for a lovely afternoon.</text>

The grounds are very pretty and I appreciate that there is free entry for the last hour of every day the grounds are peaceful, free to enter, and worth visiting for a picnic lunch.

However I was very disappointed in the museum itself for having no information about tours (there is a free Android audio tour- or your can rent a set of headphones for $4- but they don't inform you of this), dates on items (there's a list of the eras on the wall on one of the top galleries- I saw it at the end) a map of the any of the galleries Etc.

I was also disappointed to learn that they have planetarium exhibits every day but when I ask them at the desk it had already ended for the day. I was there in time but they did not let me know that it was ending early.

Overall staff needs more training and to be more informative.< /Review>

We took a group of mixed aged kids from 4-12 and had the tour. It was lovely, the kids loved it and were wanting more. At the end of our tour we were given tickets for all the children to return for reentry at no cost. Lovely grounds, great for picnics or just for wandering around to enjoy the sights and the koi pond.<//Review>

Had a great experience very informative and it looked small from the outside but once inside it was a lot bigger than I assumed and had a ton of artifacts and the 4 year old mummy was kinda creepy but was a good experience my daughter enjoyed and the tour guides are really helpful and you tend to appreciate how advanced and the way of life and thinking was back then , the replica of a tomb was great and I enjoyed the informative displays they do< /text>

The last hour is free! My husband and I were looking for something fun to do last minute, and this popped up on a Google search. It looks amazing from the outside. The inside is *very* dark, but I'm sure its to preserve the artifacts, as well add to the ambiance. They have an actual like pyramid "excavation site" (dont know the actual name of it.) That you can walk through. Its super dark in there, and there's hieroglyphics on the walls, a "dig site", etc. Its really cool. They also have actual mummies, and TONS of things to look at and read about. The free hour was enough time for my husband and I to look at everything, though we did kind of rush towards the end. If you like to linger and really spend your time taking in the info and views, then I would recommend paying and spending more time.<//Text>

But I had fun, the tour at 4:30 PM was for sure the best part. Kids had fun too.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Cheap way to spend some time! I am not super into Egyptian history, but I still enjoyed this place. It had a lot of really neat trinkets of the ancient Egyptians, some educational opportunities if one was so inclined to learn more in depth about some of the things at the museum. They also had a walk through tomb which was really neat.<//Review>

Great exhibits with detailed descriptions. Easy to lose track of time and spend hours in there.

The park outside is well maintained with a fish and lotus pond, and a vegetable patch.

Parking is easy to find.<//review>

There are several rooms to explore with plenty of displays and exhibits. Some of which need maintenance, there were several with lights that did not work. Most of the exhibits appeared to be recreations, but they were still pretty amazing. It didn't take long to explore the entire place. The tomb you can walk through was a very nice touch.<//Review>< gmap_id>

This is an amazing museum in a lovely park that helps highlight several key features of Ancient Egyptian history.  There are many clearly labeled and authentic artifacts and a replica rock cut tomb that will illicit ooos and ahs from young and old.  Definitely a must visit.<//review>

Wonderful museum, excellent price, beautiful gardens and grounds. Tomb tour was amazing. The alchemy exhibit was awesome! Will return when I am in town. I recently found out that for the last hour before the museum closes each day, the admission is free. It makes for a lovely afternoon.<//review>

Really interesting place! They have an on site planetarium as well as a garden and a "maze". The ground are all taken care of well. The exhibits inside were super cool as well, with curator notes and explanations. The staff have guided tours of a tomb and artifact studies. Perfect place to spend some time and learn!< /Text>

Oh my goodness I love this place! There is a recreated tomb that is just fascinating, as well as a planetarium. There are many real Egyptian mementos as well as the Rosicrucian temple there. The Rosicrucians were a secret spiritual society that promoted wisdom and healing. They have made themselves known in this time because they are so needed. All this is in a beautiful garden with a labyrinth,  rose garden, Egyptian sculptures, and beautiful trees.< /Text>

There was a great abundance of Egyptian artifacts and displays here. It was well worth the 7 dollars we paid with the student price. The planetarium was a bit disappointing as it was just a short documentary about the sun, and didn't really tie in the relevance to the ancient Egyptian civilization. Overall, the museum was interesting and rather inexpensive.</text>

Really interesting place! They have an on site planetarium as well as a garden and a "maze". The ground are all taken care of well. The exhibits inside were super cool as well, with curator notes and explanations. The staff have guided tours of a tomb and artifact studies. Perfect place to spend some time and learn!< /text>

< Review>
Best Egyptian Museum I've ever been to.  Well, the only one, but it has a great collection of artifacts and reproductions.  The "tomb tour" is good.

There is also a planetarium attached that is in serious need of a renovation, but that does not detract from the Museum and the site (many of the things to see are actually outside).<//Review>

The man at front desk was a rude jerk, we did not  feel welcomed.
Items on view were excellent.
Management needs to redo labels and descriptions of items. They are spread too far and it is very annoying. Plus management needs to discuss appropriate behavior with it's employees since they are voice of museum. It was pretty warm in there too.<//Text>

Great exhibits with a wealth of information. Statuary and artifacts from ancient Egypt tell the story of this great civilization from several dynasties. There is a guided tomb tour,& the mummy display is popular with kids & is not frightening. The grounds are part of the AMORC religious facility & the landscape & architecture all reflect Egyptian style. As a life-long student of Egyptology, I found the experience informative & the "next best thing to being there", minus the sandstorms, venomous animals, & extreme heat. Joann at the Roscicrucian Libary is a jewel, and you cannot go wrong visiting this wonderful facility that combines history, literature, artifacts, and friendly people who love sharing the heritage of this great civilization.< /review>

This is a great museum for Egyptian enthusiasts. There were several exhibits of particular interest, including real mummies and lessons on how to play the game Senet. The only "down side" (depending on your situation) is there really isn't anything kid friendly here. Whereas many museums have more "hands on" type activities for kids, this museum is definitely more "look don't touch". Also, the planetarium is NOT a planetarium, they just show a regular movie on the wall, which was pretty disappointing...no star show or dome display (which was not mentioned anywhere we saw, though we could have missed it).< /text>

A good and accurate introduction to ancient Egypt.  Many of the artifacts are reproductions, but I have seen the originals and they look extremely faithful.   The dome theatre is broken, and now just shows some basic videos projected on a wall.   The reproduction Egyptian tomb is excellent and looks just like the real thing (though cleaner and better lit).< /review>

This is an amazing museum in a lovely park that helps highlight several key features of Ancient Egyptian history.  There are many clearly labeled and authentic artifacts and a replica rock cut tomb that will illicit ooos and ahs from young and old.  Definitely a must visit.<//text>

Love love love the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum! I've been coming here since I was 7 or 8 and I have never gotten enough. After a long time without going, I took my kindergartner here for the first time a little bit ago and she loved it! I was impressed with how well they are keeping it up. Back in my day you had to wait for the guided tomb tour, not so anymore. It's open all the time! Come ready to learn and be amazed by one of the best Ancient Egyptian collections in the world!</review>

Was closed the first time we tried to come, so walked around the gardens which are filled with nice plants and neat architecture (photo op!!). When we eventually did see the museum, it was satisfactory — informative and overfilled with items, but not the most modern nor interactive of museums. I loved the little reading nook they have with Egyptian-themed reads, probably my personal highlight. Definitely educational and a good way to spend  some down time. Also, AMA members get a discount on the entrance fee, so rememberer to bring + show your card!< /Text>

Love love love the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum! I've been coming here since I was 7 or 8 and I have never gotten enough. After a long time without going, I took my kindergartner here for the first time a little bit ago and she loved it! I was impressed with how well they are keeping it up. Back in my day you had to wait for the guided tomb tour, not so anymore. It's open all the time! Come ready to learn and be amazed by one of the best Ancient Egyptian collections in the world!< /Text>

Great collection for such a concentrated space and nice grounds.  While many large pieces are recreations, those pieces themselves are impressive and really give the feel of the real thing. I especially love the recreations of the tomb and peace garden.<//text>

<name>Bob Zomermaand<//name><review>Wow.  I am a history lover. This museum is going to have my attention when I get back to San Jose again.
The planetarium show was not worth the time spent.  If I we're rating just that I would give it a half star. What it was is a video projected on a small area of the dome. Not a planetarium show at all.  I had told my grandkids that it would be a show spread across the sky, and we got a video with Whoopi Goldberg. How sad was that?!!<//review>< GmapID>

<Review>If you're in the area and you're looking for something cultural, this is the place! And bonus, if you come within the last hour of closing, admission is actually free! I came by on a Friday afternoon and there were about 10 others in the museum. It isn't very large but it would definitely take more than an hour to explore but a great way to save some money and see a snippet of ancient Egyptian history!< /Review>< pics>

Growing up on the peninsula, it seemed like I came to the Rosicrucian Museum every year on a field trip.  In reality, I probably came four or five times.  I remember coming here and running amok with all of my school friends.  We would peer in to the mummy tombs and run through the tunnels.

It brought back great memories being here today.  However, the museum hasn't changed at all since I was here as a kid.  The exhibits are nice but technology has moved way beyond a map with locations that light up at the press of a button.  Especially in Silicon Valley, I would have expected more.

Having said that, the 12 year old and the 16 year old had fun along with the adults.  I think they may have even learned something along the way.< /text>

I fell in love with this museum the moment I went in. I couldn't believe that the mummies there were real. I especially loved going down to where it seemed like we were inside a pyramid or a cave. It was so beautiful and there was so much to learn. My family loved it. Even my 6 year old son. I highly recommend this place and would like to return soon.<//Review>

I learned quite a bit thanks to exhibits that dig into daily Egyptian life (their black eyeliner was made of lead powder which kept flies away. Who would have guessed?) I've been to the British Museum twice and I think this place totally competes. Sure, the British Museum has the scope, but this place has a level of detail that's much deeper and more informative.<//Review>< pics>

Very neat place with lots of artifacts and explanation. We visited the planetarium, which was nice to be in because it was one of the oldest ones in the country, but they didnt project the stars on to the ceiling like most planetariums I've visited. They just played a movie on the side of the dome. But staff was friendly, and well worth a visit.< /review>

I learned more about ancient Egypt and its pantheon than we knew before. There’s a lot to take in. All aspects of Egyptian life are covered. I thought the curation did a very good job at showing how average ancient Egyptians would have lived, not just the nobility. We especially like the model of the tomb.At the end of the tour there’s a video on the Rosicrucian religion. My husband and I are devout non-joiners so we ignored the PR message and just enjoyed the museum, as a museum. FYI – If you are put off by folks trying to convert you, the Rosicrucian video is very low key. And I don’t think its at all mandatory. My husband and I are folks who savor every moment of a museum visit. That’s why we watched.</text>

Make sure you don't miss the garden outside. We went there after the museum closed. The entrance is on the corner of Park Ave  and Naglee Ave.< /review>

The museum was wonderful. Great assortment of Egyptian artifacts and it's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from outside.
Planetarium was a bit of a disappointment because they just showed a movie but considering it was free, I really can't complain too much.</review>

Self guided tour is fun. Nestled in a neighborhood, the tomb in the museum sometimes has a guide who explains the myths and beliefs of Egyptians' afterlife. The souvenir store was closed many years ago.</Review>

The museum was interesting and a great way to kill a morning or afternoon. The planetarium show is a huge disappointment. It's really just a regular movie on one wall of the planetarium theater. It's free but don't waste your time.</review>

An interesting place to visit in San Jose! Has lots of different Egyptian artifacts to display the different parts of Egyptian life. The displays and interior are dated, but seeing the pieces were well worth the low price.</text>

<Text>This is a small, strange museum and very poorly maintained. There are some interesting replicas of statuary and some small artifacts like beads, pottery and jewelry as well as some small mummies.

There are a few beautiful pieces and it is a relatively cheap museum to see, and it's small enough to go through in an hour or two, depending on how much time you like to spend looking at objects under glass, many of which are poorly lit and most of which are poorly described.

It was set up by amateur collectors and it shows. The information about various objects is often vague and sometimes inaccurate. The groupings of artifacts seems quite haphazard.

The Rosicrucian Order itself is a somewhat mystical group, so there is also a large space devoted to alchemy and a small reading room with shelves of books on various mystical and "new age" topics. Near the museum entrance you can watch a small video about the order. If you spend the time there, you should know what to expect of the reading room.

Overall, it might be worth visiting this museum for the novelty of the building and the grounds more than the contents, but if you have some time and don't mind giving about $12 to a fringe religious group for the experience, it can be an interesting way to spend a couple hours. Just don't expect to come out of it significantly more informed about Egyptian art or history (or even about the Rosicrucians).<//Text>< GmapID>

<Text>What a nice museum. They are closed Monday and Tuesday, but the entry is free from 4 until they close at 5 when they are open on Wednesday to Sunday. Entry is not expensive if you want to really take your time and see it all at your leisure, which we have done several times. But thanks to the generosity of the Rosicrucians, you can visit this museum for a quick look during the free hour, and that's what we did today because we were in the neighborhood. It's really cool to be able to see real mummies and actual artifacts from Egypt. The museum staff is low key and very knowledgeable. There is even a reproduction tomb you can see by going down into a simulated pyramid. Definitely go on the tomb tour so you get the full information, but this is only available during the paid period, so come back later for that. The museum has several floors, and there is even one section dedicated to alchemy. You will see statues, cuneiform writing and other artifacts and dioramas from Egypt. There is also a small planetarium where they do a short presentation. The outside of the building is also really cool and there are places to sit and gardens walk around and enjoy. Parking is smallish, but you can easily park out in the street. The neighborhood is upscale, very safe and not far from dining and shopping. This is a good little museum off the beaten path, combine it with a visit to the rose garden and make a day of it. Recommended.<//Text><Name>Joe G</Name>< user_id>

<Text>I love this place! My dad used to take me here as a kid and it was the best time. As an adult visiting now I have all the same excitement. I love showing this little gem off to visiting friends.

FYI: I wouldn't recommend this place to kids unable to read, they will likely be done in 15 minutes while you're still gaping in the first room. However they may enjoy running around and exploring outside the museum.<//Text>< Pics>

We are a homeschooling family and studied about Egypt this year, so this was an exciting place for us. We learned so much, the tour guides were fabulous and it was so great to see a lot of stuff first hand. They have a lot of original pieces and mummies! Highly recommended and definitely take a tour. So worth it.< /Review>

The gardens alone are lovely all year and free to stroll, with a labyrinth, senet game, CA native plants, fountains, palm trees, a koi pond and Egyptian architecture throughout. They have free planetarium shows daily at 2 and the museum itself has a great many artifacts and an alchemy exhibit. There is also a research library with all sorts of arcane books that is also free to look through.< /review>< Pictures>

This is a neat place. Unfortunately, it is a little small. There are a lot of artifacts and a couple mummies. Very neat to see. However, not much changes here so after going 3-4 times, it is hard to find a reason to go back.< /text>

<Review>A vast collection of curios, both authentic and recreated, from Ancient Egypt and Assyria. The museum is surrounded by placid and well-maintained gardens replete with Egyptian statuary and iconography. The mystical aside, this is a great place to broaden your horizons and refresh some of the more interesting Social Studies lessons from your childhood.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum is San Jose's best kept secret. This museum has such a unique architecture, landscape, and location in the midst of a bustling downtown school zone. Everything about this place is serene, it's the perfect place for introverted children to hang out with their grandparents, especially the alchemical museum.
Some people have said that the place is "dated" they are terribly wrong. This place is to this day unfathomably too ahead of its time. How is Alchemy related to Ancient Egypt? And why is this museum in San Jose, why not somewhere else? What is Rosicrucianism? The answers to those questions reveal that this place is much more than a museum, much more.</Review>

<time>1497903193365</time><rating>5< /rating><Text>I love my Mummy, I do.. You will too when you go to this museum which I believe has the second largest collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts, mummies, and information.  {Largest I believe is in Germany}

Plan on spending three to four hours in this multi-level building and the Planetarium next door. {They have movies there that are always interesting}.   Plan your visit so you have plenty of time to see the exhibits, the movie, and then return to the exhibits and gift shop.

The site has a gift shop, a parking lot out back, a flower and Koi pool garden, and much more.

The entry fee is low and the value is tremendous.  If you are in the San Jose area for one day, then I recommend going to the Winchester House in the AM, then to the Rose Garden and a restaurant for lunch, and then to this Egyptian Museum in the afternoon .   It is a full day, but well worth it.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Love the Rosicrucian Museum!  A great place to take your kids to learn about ancient Egypt.  Beautiful gardens.  Don't miss the 'tour of the tomb' with a live guide, offered daily.  A small cozy museum, but well worth it if you are in the San Jose area and find Egypt fascinating.</review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I love this place, and not just because I am a rosicrucian. The vibes here are so calming and restorative, if you can, try and come on an equinox, or an early Sunday morning, and trace your footsteps along a garden maze, and contemplate your place in the universe, while gazing into the meditation pool, which if I'm remembering correctly has some koi fish in it. I took many pictures of the outdoor gardens and posted them here on Google, but if for some reason, that one didn't make it up, leave a message, and I'll upload more.  I have no problem uploading more pictures, but to experience the truly inspiring magic of the place, you should visit in person, and plan on spending a good amount of time absorbing the energy that is inherent with each step thru the gardens.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This is a neat place. Unfortunately, it is a little small. There are a lot of artifacts and a couple mummies. Very neat to see. However, not much changes here so after going 3-4 times, it is hard to find a reason to go back.< /text>

I learned more about ancient Egypt and its pantheon than we knew before. There’s a lot to take in. All aspects of Egyptian life are covered. I thought the curation did a very good job at showing how average ancient Egyptians would have lived, not just the nobility. We especially like the model of the tomb.At the end of the tour there’s a video on the Rosicrucian religion. My husband and I are devout non-joiners so we ignored the PR message and just enjoyed the museum, as a museum. FYI – If you are put off by folks trying to convert you, the Rosicrucian video is very low key. And I don’t think its at all mandatory. My husband and I are folks who savor every moment of a museum visit. That’s why we watched.</text>

<Review>A little underwhelming and overpriced. Fairly small and almost no interactivity. There are some really cool artifacts and great explanations. I enjoyed the outside quite a bit too. Also I'm not sure if this is normal or their system was down but they had to write down my credit card information on a piece of paper?

The connected planetarium was pretty bad though. While it is apparently one of the first ones in all of the US, when I went there, they only showed a tiny rectangular video on a corner of the dome instead of a proper dome experience. The video itself also seemed like a cheap 20 year old documentary you can just watch on YouTube. Definitely not worth the time.</Review>< user>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>The greatest museum I visited in Bay Area in the last year!  They have excellent exhibits, you can read a lot of useful information about them as well as about ancient lifestyle in a whole. We had a luck to catch two guided tours (it is advertised with information system and free for everybody), our guide was awesome.
We spent 5 hours in this place and left it only because had not enough strength to continue. We are going to visit it again, for sure!
Couple technical notes:
-it is very cheap, only $9 per adult.
-there are a lot of free parking around.
-not sure that it is good for kids, because it is more like scientific museum, not an entertainment.
-be sure to take warm clothes, they have pretty cold rooms where mummies are laid.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
I've loved this museum since my first time going 25 years ago. It doesn't have the most elaborate displays, but for only being $9, it scratches the itch for an afternoon filled with ancient history. That being said, I think my biggest complaint is the lack of decorum from the guests that come in. I spent a couple hours there and it was full of screaming children that were running around. I absolutely cannot believe that these parents nowadays think that everyone in the world should have to listen to their children's tantrums. This isn't a children's museum. It's not full of bubbles and hands-on inventions like the Discovery Museum. None of the displays can be understood by children under 5 (i.e. you need to know how to read). So why are these young and unruly children allowed to ruin the experience of people who want to learn? Parents: Learn some manners. If your kid starts crying/screaming/talking loudly/running around in a quiet museum, they should be taken outside immediately; not after 10 minutes of trying to rectify the behavior. Better yet, don't bring kids under 5 here, period. Trust me, it's no fun for them or the people who have to listen to them! Museum employees: You need to lay down some better boundaries with these disrespectful parents.</Review>

A museum like no other. The place is a little... peculiar👁 with it being in part a Rosicrucian museum but you definitely will feel as though you're walking through history itself.The architecture and interiors are flawless.< /text>

From the beautiful gardens filled with extraordinary smells to the tons of ancients books and artifacts. I was so intrigued by the alchemy exhibit I had to return! Only the second time I spent the whole time emersed in so equally fantastic books in the rosicrucian library. The librarian was super knowledgable and friendly!

Nice displays of ancient Egyptian artifacts, plus some Babylonian stuff that ended up in Egypt due to trade. If you go, make sure you download the audio tour to your phone! It is really good.<//review>

<Text>Very very cool mummy collection and artifacts. I was particularly surprised by the mummified baboon and the secret it contains. I came here for a school project and was able to find everything on my list in a reasonable amount of time and enjoyed myself in the process. When I attended there was no AC and the platarium was not doing full dome projections but other than those 2 things it was a good experience. Also, the Rosicrucian history is interesting if you haven't hear of that before.</Text><Name>Vic Led< /Name><UserId.>111091652904807736176</UserId.><gmapID>0x808fcb6b68eb46d5:0x813b70ab82510592<//gmapID><Rate>4< /Rate>< Response>

<review>I haven't been there in 20 years, but I remember all my thoughts while there as if it were yesterday. I remember every step I took, every artifact I saw. I'm taking my 9 y/o daughter in 2 weeks. She has been begging to go to a museum and I wanted to take her to the best one. Well, since Mars isn't accessible, we'll just come here!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The exterior of the museum is a peaceful  area filled with gardens, a koi pond, and various plants, trees and flowers that make it a great space to walk around or take pictures. The inside of the museum is dimly lit when you first enter but the lighting encompassing the artifacts is well lit. There are many wondrous objects to discover and a recreated tomb area that was really cool to go in! Definitely recommend going here! It is also ada accessible and has student discounts and it is free after 5 pm<//Text>

Really bad service. I suggest everyone not to go on weekdays. This is what I was told by the admission girl in the front. I drove down from LA...and just want to visit the tomb, but was asked to wait 30 minutes. 30 minutes later, I was asked to wait another 30 minutes. I paid full price to go in, I don't think I m any less important then the school tours. I was told that this is what happened if I go on a weekday. We left without visiting the tomb. I ve also filed a complaint via their website, but no replies.</review>

Disappointing!!! It’s actually really sad this place. Went here on a school field trip. I was very disappointed that they teach about Egypt, but fail to mention the word Africa, as if they intentionally mean to leave it out. No one that works there is black, and most of the displays are made with fair skinned examples. I’m not African, but I find it disturbing.

The point is to learn about hr culture, people and landscape. Epic fail.</Review>

<text>It is a beautiful museum with 4 galleries. It shows all the eras of egyptian history, and houses real mummies and  also houses replicas of many tombs. However, i saw very less information on pyramids, which i was eager to explore. Rest the museum is a good representation of egyptian history.<//text></record>

Entry fee was $8. Had to find parking on the street. The exhibits were very informative and the whole museum is laid out well. Overall took about b two hours to go through all the exhibits.<//Review>

Theres at least 3 hours of eye candy if you take your time. Interesting mummies but hands down best part was the alchemy set up. The guides are informative and clean. I went with another person, and it was a Thursday so yay elementary school fieldtrip? We avoided the children by alternating exhibits. The only compaint was that the little stamp stations do not stamp well on skin haha tho i understand it is meant for paper.</text>

Nice to visit this place for sake of the fact. Not sure how this museum was created in San Jose and what's the intention. Planetarium has some show with an outdated movie about space objects.</Text>

<username>Joel Headley</username><Review>Small museum with mummies and other artifacts and casts of artifacts. My 6 year old was a little bored by it all, but the older kids (8-12) enjoyed walking through the exhibit.

The gardens outside are very nice and the kids enjoyed playing around the fountain outside.< /Review>< pics>

Irrelevant to you all - from decades ago.  (No computers to leave reviews)  My mom always took us kids there.  It was free.  Never tired of the mummies & shrunken heads.  Hope they still have shrunken heads - fascinating.  The tomb room - dark & mysterious w/the rocky floor.  No guided tours - no guides - you got to wander around as long as you wanted.  The Museum should know just how long it's been a glorious place to visit.  Sounds like much has changed - the crowds & waiting to be let in?  "The times they are a-changin"...  (no planetarium then)< /Text>

Egyptian artifacts, a park that is modeled after an ancient Egyptian structure, a planetarium next door... all kinds of neat stuff here! Definitely not like a normal museum.<//Review>

Very interesting exhibits and a surprisingly large collection! My 1st and 3rd grader loved it and I would like to go back by myself to linger over some parts at a slower, grown-up pace.< /Text>

< review>
My husband and I were here about 15 years ago and quite enjoyed it. When we brought our kids this month we were fairly disappointed. The museum itself is "old school," not very coherent in its presentation. The planetarium show was disappointing. Instead of a full hemispherical show about the ancient Egyptians' astronomical science (very entertaining once upon a time) we got a dumbed-down, tiny DVD movie about stars, about which my 9th-grade son pointed out several factual errors. So go for the sarcophagi, but skip the planetarium.< /review>

Theres at least 3 hours of eye candy if you take your time. Interesting mummies but hands down best part was the alchemy set up. The guides are informative and clean. I went with another person, and it was a Thursday so yay elementary school fieldtrip? We avoided the children by alternating exhibits. The only compaint was that the little stamp stations do not stamp well on skin haha tho i understand it is meant for paper.</Text>

Unbelievable how the artifacts have been preserved.  A walk through ancient Egypt that I will do more than once since it felt kind of hurried due to it being a field trip.< /Text>

What a gem ! A delightful collection of artifacts from various ancient societies (Egypt, Mesopotamia etc) with great exhibits many of which are interactive.

The museum ground are also well kept and have many interesting statues and well as trees and plans  from various parts of the world.< /Text>

The place doesn't have separate ramp for wheelchair and stroller and so we have to carry our stroller up and down the steps when we move from room to room. Also bigger backpacks is not encouraged and will be aaked to store at front desk. It is a good place for people without kids or with kids who can behavior appropriately throughout the visit.< /Review>< name>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>The mixed reviews on this place made me hesitant to go, but I'm glad I did. I took my two kids ages 9 & 11 and we spent the afternoon wandering the museum. It was a rainy Friday and it wasn't crowded. All of us enjoyed it very much. We should have come earlier in the day to be able to thoroughly explore all of it and I feel the need to return to do so. It houses an impressive collection of mostly authentic ancient Egyptian artifacts as well as some replicas and castes of artifacts housed elsewhere - mostly it's the real deal. Lots of indepth descriptions with each item allow for a deeper understanding and appreciation of the exhibits. It is highly educational. The composit tomb replica is fun and the tour worth while. The whole place has a lovely and pleasant atmosphere, including the gardens, though we didn't make it to the planetarium. I also enjoyed the educational exhibit about the history of alchemy and learning about the founding society of the museum. If you are interested in Archeology, Ancient Egypt, Alchemy, The Rosicrucians, or just enjoy museums, this is a must. It's not a physically huge place, but it is quite concentrated and makes for a lovely day.</text>< user>

Wish I could give zero stars.  Attempted to take my 4 children ages 2-14 and within 10 minutes the front lobby staff managed to make us feel so unwelcome we left.  Scolded my 2 year old 5 times to not "jump" or "stomp" as waited in line for admission. These kids who work here need a lesson in PR. So absolutely rude and unprofessional! DO NOT BRING SMALL CHILDREN!</review>

The museum has a great collection of artifacts from all eras of the Egyptian civilization.
If real mummies are not mysterious enough, they have a walk-through replica of a tomb. I was amazed to by the details of the carvings and the beautiful wall paintings in its chambers.

The museum has a planetarium with a daily show which was a complete let-down. It uses a low-resolution, rectangular projector which looks worse than a large-screen TV. The ticket for it is free for visitors of the museum. So, I can't complain much.

Definitely a great place to visit for someone interested in ancient history.</review>

Parking is in back, and across the street in back,  quite a bit.  The tour of the tomb is worth the price of admission.   Maybe twice a day  like  11 and 2, dunno.

The philosophy of the Rosicrucians is interesting too.   There is a video running continuously.   like a secret order.   international.

Too much to absorb in just one trip.< /Review>

<Text>On a family vacation, stopped in for a few hours before heading to Sacramento with my 8 year old.
Staff at the front desk offered to mind our giant bag as it wouldnt fit in a locker.   Lots of little tidbits of information spanning generations, beautiful mummies of the human and animal sort, daily life information, alchemy, farming, religion and construction.
The grounds and gardens are beautiful and a good area to have a quick lunch.
The koi pond in back could use some love, though. There was only one large fish, and it was covered in growths on its skin,and the water was full of algea and only a few submerged plants for the fish to hide in.
Interesting place for small groups with larger children.< /Text>< Pictures>

my 5th grade class went here in 1988 or 1987. we were playing with koosh balls in the courtyard. we saw the ancient practices of human preservation. we should now be doing cryopreservation as needed in every case. i will make that happen with politicians and paying people to get frozen. i am superstitious.</Text>

Out side looks very cult like with (in my opinion lots of wasted space) there is a nice fountain you can relax around and eat lunch at, if your in the area. There is a koi pond with one "foot long" koi fish and a bunch of little ones" I was not impressed. (Outside grounds 2 stars)
The inside has lots of relics some real some fake. There are a couple of dark rooms upstairs with fake relics that are set up to look like a worship room. (Way to satanic for me) 0 stars.
We went in the Planetarium where I saw a collection of their paraphernalia on there occult  beliefs. it was all I could stand, I turned around and walked out.
I went home and did some research on them, turns out I'm not far off the mark. They are definitely an occult and believe in mysticism 0 Stars.

My goto place every time I have a visitor from out of the area. The shock value of taking somebody to see a replica pharaoh's tomb where they'd least expect to find it - in Silicon Valley, of all places - simply cannot be beat.

The free and ample parking nearby is quite convenient and the museum store sells memorable goodies.<//Text>

Love the museum artifacts & planetarium. I have been coming here since I was a child.

The Rosecrusion Museum was created to strengthen their believers ties with an ancient egyptian form of spiritism. Rosecusionists curate the museum to support their belief system. Over the years, items of questionable origin have been slowly curated out of public display. One such example, a piece of the original 10 Commandments, amazed me as a child.

Beware, the docents are Rosecusionists. They will attempt to indoctrinate you. Docents use the displays to give credence to the historical interpretations & pseudoscientific beliefs embraced by Rosecusionism.

The replica tomb, mummies, tomb artifacts, mummification recipes, ancient languages & scripts all support archeological discoveries made in Egypt. How those findings are interpreted is where differing ideas have evolved.< /text>

The museum was fairly interesting. However, it should be known that this place is connected to a cultlike organization. Your defenses are lowered because you expect to be at a museum, but over time go through the sickening process of realizing the unscientific and misleading nature of the place. I had a background creepy sense the entire time I was there, but I didn’t know why.  Realization came when I walked by a video in which it’s explained that Rosicrucians do not practice the alchemy of old which apparently was changing based materials into gold!!!???

Are you kidding me. There is not a single way to just magically transform something into gold.  Sorry.  So calling this place a museum is a travesty.

Later on, I realized that this was a spiritual place, so I attempted to engage with it on a spiritual level. There were beautiful gardens outside and I meditated for a while.

People in various religions have always attempted to use the spiritual to gain control the physical, thinking that there is some way to circumvent the basic laws of the universe. For instance, the desire to magically learn how to turn rocks into gold, rather than doing the real work of doing something of service to others that will be paid for in return. For me, reaching into the spiritual involves the relinquishing of control, rather than this appropriation of control through the spiritual world.

I’m a scientific and a spiritual guy. I think that this museum has it wrong on both fronts. Very disgusted and disturbed by this experience, but I also learned a lot (about strange spirituality and pseudoscience), so in the end I guess it was quite educational “museum.”

On the other hand to be fair, the gardens were an excellent site for meditation and it’s definitely a spiritual place, that’s great. I just wish it felt like more of a real, authentic and not delusional spirituality, and that it was explicitly stated that this is basically a church.

Also one more thing, they claim that a guy name Hank was the founder of this Rosicrucian movement, but I did some research and this movement actually started in the 17th century. Not sure how Hank the founder fits into that.

Lol.<//text>

<Review>Interesting both as a repository of many things Egyptian, but also as a glimpse into Rosicrucians, a secret religious order.  They had a video that described it, claimed many famous adherents, but I wasn't clear about how it related to Egyptology.  I was surprised at the size of their facilities.

The tomb replica was pretty cool, as was the replica of the Rosetta stone and the obelisk with the code of Hamerabi.  There were cool statues and busts of Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and Cleopatra, and of course they had a mummy and embalming jars to hold the organs that were removed.

I would have been interested to get more commentary about social implications of expending tremendous resources on burial places to provide for continued success in the afterlife of the rich and powerfull.

The exhibition on alchemy was interesting and while it showed some shortcomings of practicing chemistry without a good theoretical basis, it was what they had available.  Much of what they "knew" about earth/water/air/fire must have held back science.  It seems like they codified and institutionalized some of their technology and controlled how it was shared.

However, they seemed to have a bunch of gear for experiments, and must have found some useful and repeatable processes despite reliance on superstition and analogies instead of periodic tables.  While goals like conversion of base metals to gold were misguided, they did some complex and for the age, sophisticated stuff like distillation that had useful applications.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcb6b68eb46d5:0x813b70ab82510592< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

They have about four galleries of artifacts on display. You can tour a replica of a tomb, and thereias a planetarium, although they did not have an appropriate program to show in it when we were there.< /Review>

Lots of Egyptian artifacts, allocate several hours to visit, make sure to go into the underground crypt, free if you arrive within 1 hour of closing.<//Review>

Went to see a planetarium show entitled "Journey to the Stars".  It was nothing more than a regular projector and a youtube quality 23 minute movie.  Not a dome show at all.  What is the point of watching a regular format movie in a planetarium???  Super disappointed.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) This is a great museum that guests must visit. In particular, there are people who think of a masterpiece in the style of the French writer Rodin, and the door to Hell is so impressive that they stand 30 minutes in front of it. Egypt Pavilion, South America Pavilion, China Pavilion Here, Korea Goryeo Ceramics Museum is the best in Northern California. I highly recommend you to see it.

손님이오면 꼭가는 훌륭한 박물관임. 특히 프랑스작가 로뎅작풍에 대표작 생각하는 사람이있고 지옥에문은 그앞에서 30분을 서있을정도로 압권입니다. 이집트관 남미관 중국관 여기에 한국고려자기도 현대미술관 등등 북가주에서는 최고입니다. 꼭보시라고 적극추천합니다.<//Review>< Date>

<rating>4< /rating><review>(Translated by Google) Very interesting museum with a beautiful garden. There are many statues and buildings in the style of ancient Egyptian architecture. One feels that he really is in Egypt. We did not go in because of the expensive entrance fee, but the architecture of the garden was successful.

Velmi zajímavé muzeum s krásnou zahradou. Je zde spousta soch a budov ve stylu staroegyptské architektury. Člověk zde má pocit, že opravdu v Egyptě je. Dovnitř jsme nešli, kvůli drahému vstupnému, nicméně architektura zahrady se povedla.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnjOzeruwe_XBjmU9iFNB6vYex_cF5FE28OvEp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlqMm4ObZXsBUBDV5nlUzoDMaC9YJxl8g_NGRW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQuhwIkLu5DtM_8Q30gcTCD9Jt5QY6XgkMecor=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpkqmoaUk9ftr4RX7O4nQtbZTSvjL-_ZHqE6nu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjhfjPyd2ClHmNL2TkarYNPV3HPrQFFZBBv7oQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT3C-t0OfSCxfFtqtv7Rx2WbiQ-vZEqheKbE08=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKlIl5whGMEBwWL32szS0vUVbmP90IgCbX6ncA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo63doxsYTutlcW0gvFW3pzNXYrY1X_p9-jOSG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwxnIeUfoxXBteUyhixDg-ng9Jg_oq--WdCeIB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Excellent attention by the staff that works there, has several rooms to get out knowing a little more about this ancient and imposing culture, has access for wheelchairs and they discount children and older adults, as well as students. The place is very clean and at all times they were kind to us. I definitely recommend it widely.

Excelente atención por parte del personal que labora ahí, tiene varias salas para salir conociendo un poco más de esta antigua e imponente cultura, tiene acceso para sillas de ruedas y hacen descuento a niños y adultos mayores, así como a estudiantes. El lugar está muy limpio y en todo momento fueron amables con nosotros. Sin duda lo recomiendo ampliamente.< /Review>

The Egyptian Museum in San Jose. It was very surprising that there was such a museum in San Jose, but the inside was fulfilling and it was a lot of fun!

(Translated by Google) This is the largest Egyptian-themed museum in the West, built by the son of Harvey Spencer Lewis, the founder of the ancient mysterious sect of the Rose Cross, who believes in the mysterious religion of ancient Egypt, to showcase his father's collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts. The entire building completely mimics the style of the Egyptian temple and is said to be the only museum in the world to be built into an Egyptian temple.

这是美西最大的埃及主题博物馆，由信奉古埃及神秘宗教的玫瑰十字古老神秘教团的创始人Harvey Spencer Lewis的儿子建立，用于展示他父亲收藏的古埃及文物。整个建筑完全模仿埃及神殿的风格，据说是全世界唯一一座修成埃及神庙的博物馆。</text>
