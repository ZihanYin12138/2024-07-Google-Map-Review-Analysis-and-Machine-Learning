< review>
I highly recommend A Touch of Gold Pet Grooming! I got an appointment the same day that I called. They're so kind, & detail oriented. My German Shepherd got a de-shed, & didn't have one loose hair after which is very impressive!! She left shiny, fluffy, & fresh! I'm very pleased with the work. I'll be recommending A Touch of Gold Pet Grooming to my friends, & anyone looking for a new groomer.🐾❤️🐶🐕🐕‍🦺❤️🐾<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>This is the only groomer who successfully completed an entire grooming session on my two, 7-month-old puppies. They even went above and beyond and threw in complimentary bleaching shampoo for my white Husky. They were very responsive and did all this for us at a very last-minute, same day appointment. I'm so grateful for these ladies!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Good place! Tanisha helped us out when we adopted our dog. Called everywhere and nowhere had walk ins. And or new pup needed a really good grooming. She did a great job, made our pup look like a new dog! Great customer service. She even told us things about our dog that a vet didn’t even diagnose. Our to go grooming place for our baby dog. Thanks!< /text>

I love A Touch of Gold Pet Groomer! Always able to squeeze my furbabies in! And they really listen when you ask them to cut a certain style!  I went through a handful of groomers that would butcher my babies hair so bad 👎  so glad to finally get the recommendation for this place!  They always have my furbabies looking and smelling fresh!<//Text>

After searching for weeks, I looked into A Touch of Gold Grooming, and I couldn't be happier! I have two larger lab mixes, one long hair and one short hair. My short haired one got a bath and is so soft! My long haired one got a bath and hair cut. Both of their ears are the cleanest ever! And they both smell amazing! They got me in the SAME day! (which is a huge plus for me!) Their prices are VERY reasonable! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thank you guys, I will definitely come to you next time we need services!<//Text>

I THINK I WOULD'VE NOTICED IF MY DOG HAD HEMORRHAGES IN BOTH OF HIS EYES before we left the house. Not to mention, he still hasn’t stopped shaking and was scared to move when I picked him up. These are all red flags. Please do yourself and your pup a favor and go somewhere else. Yes they’re affordable, but not at the expense of your fur baby.<//review>< date>

<text>This place is very professional. After taking my dogs to other places, I finally found the best one! A Touch Of Gold. It is obvious for me, after my dogs were groomed there. They smelled great. They are always excited to get in, when we get there. It's the only place I will take my precious Boston Terrier, Dug E. (we took our 1st dog Rookie Martin, there too,  who recently passed away-A Touch Of Gold, was so caring, and compassionate, and shared our pain-Very personable! We appreciated the flowers, Tanisha)
I recommended this place to my niece who also has a dog, Tank. They loved it, as well.<//text>< Resp>

< Review>
I had gone to Classy K-9 Clips for 10 years, but once she sold it to another owner, I thought I would try a new groomer.  What a mistake!  I have a long hair Chihuahua which my husband explained to the guy at the counter how we like the grooming to be done since it was his first visit.  When he picked him up he had shaved most of his coat to about 1/4 inch.  That has only happened once by mistake in the 13 years we have had him.  He looked like a cross between a poodle cut and a lion with a long mane.  They had shaved his pants off, but left puffs of hair on his legs.  We were not happy at all, but considering his age, we didn't think it would matter as much. We are on bonus time with his heart/kidney diseases.  After getting him home, we noticed they hadn't even cleaned his ears.  I don't know if it was an "off" day with the two guys working there, but we are never going again!< /Review>

They've always done wonderful and Daisy always comes out eager to leave but happy. Today was the first time trying the teeth cleaning. Oh my gosh I was amazed. Daisy back teeth were horrible and the vet would charge me over $800 to put her out and work on her. Tanisha did this for $100 and they are white as can be and Daisy didn't have to be put under anesthesia. Would so recommend this place.< /text>< pics>

We travel to Oceanside often to visit our daughter and needed to get our baby Shih Tzu groomed. they accommodated our busy schedule and got us in same day we called with no appointment!! We could not be more pleased with the customer service and quality of work!! I'm very picky when it comes to the quality of a groom and they nailed it here!! 5 stars for sure! we will be back, Thank You Again.</Review>

I am so THANKFUL for Tanisha and her exceptional grooming to animals!  Today was my first visit and she was so helpful working with my time frame and taking care of my White Jindo Dog, Evie.  I was astonished to see how beautiful, groomed, nails clipped, ears cleaned, etc and how happy our little girl was after a wonderful bath.  Highly recommend and will be a customer forever!!!!</review>

<Review>Terrible experience! Brought my dog in for a grooming with pictures of how I'd like her cut. Spoke to the owner,Tanisha Banks, she said her daughter would do the cut. When I picked up my dog her cut was nothing like the picture. She claimed she thought the pictures were for another dog. Although my card specifically asked for the Teddy Bear cut. She said she would give me a discount on the next cut which her mother would do. I showed up for my 10:30 appointment and Tanisha hadn't made it in. I left at 11:00 and she still wasn't there and I never received the courtesy of a call. If you care about your dog this isn't the place to go!<//Review>< GmapID>

I have been going here for 5 years And counting I take my long hair cat to be groomed and get a good short hatcut because the cat gets too hot and will pull it out and get back hair ball so she does everything for me Tasha is great and she cares about my pet  and when I have questions or concerns she will answer then for me love this little place.</review>

They were very friendly. The hair cut is ok. Very uneven. I have to take scissors to cut all of the long weird hair that was missed. For the price they aren't too bad. They do have top notch customer service.</Text>

<date>1470253857961<//date><Rate>2<//Rate><Review>They deffinetly over schedule. My dog has been there 4 hours a couple of times just for a bath. When you schedule for a certain time you would assume he would be worked on right away since that is his slot you had to schedule for, but apparently not here. They kept him in a cage for a while before even taking care of him. I only got him back once where he looked really good. Other times he came back still wet and didn't look any better then what I could have done. Every time I took him there he got so scared and wouldn't move from the door. It was concerning for me that he acted like that because he never does. I don't take him there anymore.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>This is only my 2nd time, but they do a good job, which is why I went back!
Unfortunately, the dog I take in for grooming barks and barks . . . and barks . . . Agh! I believe he barks the entire time he is there! Can you imagine a dog barking for over an hour and they still smile at me when I pick him up?! They get extra kodo's for being patient and putting up with it!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>I went in with no expectations just tired of waking up everyday in pain. Beth fit me for my arch supports and throughly explained the product for me. I was very happy with how well the inserts felt from the start. After purchasing I began to wear them as I was instructed to and started feeling the benefits rather quickly. I am now wearing them all day at work. As a nurse I walk about 10-15k steps per shift so my feet are essential to my work. I am waking up now with substantially less foot pain and feel much better on my feet at work. I would recommend this store to anyone experiencing foot or heel pain.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>Been suffering foot pain for one time. Came here to see what options were offered in arch support. Took between 40-45 minutes to take some measures and evaluate what the foot was doing.
Micheal was very helpful, explained their system calmly and clearly. Very professional.
Felt comfortable asking questions along the way and he often asked if I had any questions as well.
They will continue to check in with me to see how I come along.
The total price of the system is expensive but if it works and helps the pain, I think it will be worth it.
The insoles are lifetime guaranteed.
I will update the review based on how the process continues and how it ends up working for me.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1621991037082, 'text': 'Rebekka, thank for sharing your experience. We are looking forward hearing how things improve.'}</Response>< gmapID>

The product was a bit pricey, but it was definitely worth the investment.  My feet is feeling a whole lot better already after using the 3-step system arch support for just half a day.  Great service too!<//review>

Had been experiencing foot pain from the metatarsal pad on my left foot. I was assessed and fitted for insoles, the pain disappeared instantly. I was also educated about proper fitting shoes as well as how our feet can break down due to improper weight distribution  on the pressure points on our feet. I also bought some good walking shoes there. Thank you so much Jonelle for all your help and professionalism. I highly recommend visiting Good Feet should you have feet issues, they will take good care of you.< /Text>

Service was outstanding! The Goodfeet system works better than any other orthotic device I have tried, and I have tried a few. The meant different options in terms of shoes was impressive. The care my Representative showed in fitting me was mind-blowing! Who knew that my feet weren't size 10 and A half, but size 12?!!! I'll tell you who. Not any other shoe store I have gone to in my adult life, including SAS Shoes.< /Text>

We went to Good Feet a year ago for my daughter, she was having severe leg & foot pain during softball. Our experience was awesome! They explained exactly what the issue was & got her into some inserts & she immediately felt relief. She grew over the past year & we went back in & got new inserts & had the same great service. Clients for life!!< /review>

The service was amazing. I loved the personal one-on-one care and attention to detail. They were also great at explaining exactly what was going on with my feet. (Dumbing it down when I needed that wasn’t a problem for them either.) I will say that I was a bit shocked at the price (especially at first). The price is the only reason I give them four stars instead of five. It’s not for the faint of heart, or small of wallet/purse. (For my style/build it cost $300 per pair of inserts plus an additional $20 per pair of “athletic cushions” or rather pads/soles that go over the inserts. They have a three tier system, so they prefer to sell you one of each of the three types of inserts and three sets of “athletic cushions.” For those of you not interested in doing the math, that would have been $960 for me before taxes. Prices may or may not vary based on what your style/build of foot is. I honestly don’t know.) The people are exceptionally helpful, and caring, though. My experience with them was absolutely fantastic, and I’d recommend them to almost anyone. I cannot stress this enough... Again, I was treated by Truly wonderful customer service, and I’d recommend them to almost Anyone.<//text>

I regret not stopping in sooner, worth every penny!  I have dealt with ankle pain for years and was very impressed at how it disappeared almost instantly after wearing my Good Feet Store 3-Step Sysrem only a few days.  It's been a month now and I'm walking 2 miles every morning with my wife before work.  Thats something I could never do before becuase the ankle pain was just too much to deal with.  Thank you to the team at the Fresno, CA  Good Feet Store.</review>

My husband rants and raves about his inserts that he never goes even 1 day without wearing (which he also bought from Good Feet many many years ago) I recently started jogging and my feet we’re starting to become sore. My husband took me in and John was so nice, patient and helpful. My entire experience there was amazing!!’ We purchased the inserts and immediately I could feel the difference and within a week of wearing the inserts I couldn’t even feel them in my shoes. The soreness I once had is no longer an issue for me since I started using the inserts from Good Feet. I would highly recommend Good Feet.

<review>I went to Good Feet because I was experiencing shoulder pain when I would walk long distances. I saw my chiropractor who suggested I get better arch support. I saw the Good Feet commercial and decided to give them a call. The customer service was superior from the onset. Jonelle the fitting specialist explained the process and the pricing and made sure I was fitted for the different types of shoes I wear. I would recommend Good Feet to anyone needing arch support; it has made a tremendous impact in my life.

Sincerely,

Trina T.</review>< Pictures>

I’m so thankful for The Good Feet store. I’ve been wearing their insoles since 2006. Last week I purchased the 3-Step system and it is helping with my plantar faciaitis.
Alicia is the foot specialist that fitted me. She really knows her product and was super nice. I highly recommend this store and their products. The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 star rating is that the products are a bit pricey.

< Review>
I had pressure sores and went to two podiatrists and they were no help. Both of them wanted me to come in every two weeks to dig out the problem, so my feet hurt all of the time. My girlfriend found the good feet store and I went in. The gentleman there helped me to pick the correct inserts and I went through the break-in period. I will tell you that my feet felt much better right away and now they are 1000% better.   They even work on my size 17 feet. If you have foot issues. " Go To The Good Feet Store". I mean it!!</Review>

<review>I struggle with metarsalgia and had to wear a boot for 3 weeks. The boot helped but it was a struggle to put on and take off every time I drove my car.  That is when I decided to go to The Good Feet. John was very nice, professional and knowledgeable. I decided to purchase the 3 step arch supports and I'm glad I made that choice. I can now walk with very minimal pain. I highly recommend The Good Feet!< /review><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

<review>Beth was the associate who fitted me. She was extraordinarily helpful and knowledgeable about the GoodFeet product. As I have a unique situation of a considerable amount of hardware holding my legs together, (following multiple injuries) I felt confident in Beth’s expertise and guidance in the fitting process to find the perfect balance for my needs.  Additionally, Beth did a wonderful job of informing me of what was included with my purchase and what the GoodFeet policies are.
I purchased the complete GoodFeet System and am already feeling the benefits after only 4 days.
Thank you so much for helping to significantly improve the quality of my life.
I wish you all the best for continued success.
GoodFeet has my highest endorsement.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Having been active for most of my life, I have my share of bumps and bruises.  But I didn’t know how badly my arches affected my “duck feet” when I walked.  My feet are more forward facing now and I feel so much more stable than I thought possible.  Good arch supports aren’t inexpensive, but your good health is priceless.  Thank you Good Feet!< /review></record></dataset><record>

I wear them all day-everyday. My lower back pain improved by day two, and my back (upper and lower,) my hip, and even my knees have all been feeling better. My range of motion, or my willingness-to-move for that matter, is great. I felt the adjustments happening with pops and clicks in some joints and just like that, lots of pain and stiffness was gone. I had a stiff pain in my right hip for over 20yrs from ice-skating and that went away by day two. I recommended them to my boss and he said he would stop by.
I will never again go without my arch supports from "The Good Feet Store." Ray Appleton, from KMJ radio Fresno, said it would change my life, and I think he was right.

Excellent service and couldn’t be more satisfied with the results. The inserts have done wonders with the pain I was having with my bunion. I would caution they do take time to break in. Don’t rush it like I did and run 8 miles in them before you are ready. Had to stop wearing them for 4 or 5 days to let my arches rest. No problem any more and back to running in them once again.</review>

<review>Painful flat feet was an ongoing problem for many years. Arch supports from a pharmacy didn’t help and a pair from a podiatrist weren’t 100% effective. A good friend came over with Good Feet inserts and allowed me to wear them for a few minutes. The relief was immediate! Instead of measuring my footsteps, I felt like running down the street. At the first opportunity, I bought a pair and never regretted the purchase. They are a miracle.<//review>< Rate>

Jonelle does a great job ensuring my footwear will work for its intended purpose. As a repeat customer she still takes time to measure my feet each visit and makes sure I have exactly what I need. That’s why I come back over and over.< /review>

< Review>
These arch supports saved the quality ofmy life. There were mornings I was unable to get out of bed because I was not able to stand on my feet. Literally, I would have to ease the burden of bearing my body weight unto my feet.  This almost daily ritual could take up to 40 minutes and even longer to fully stand some mornings. Often I would come home from work with my feet so sore that I would refuse to remove my shoes, because the security and tightness of the shoe was holding back pain.  I had frequent issues with my Achilles and often would have to refrain from excessive walking or running. Within a week of getting my supports, ALL of what I just described went away. 100%. I have zero issues with my feet now. My nagging back pain went away.  Who knew...? Had I known this was possible, I would have bought these several years earlier. Also, all my new shoes wear even on the soles, where as before I would have uneven premature wearing of corners and sides of the soles. It is not an exaggeration that these arch supports improved not only the quality of my life but my eagerness to do more activities. Places like amusement parks are enjoyable again... so far as the walking goes. This was an investment into quality of life and it is worth every penny.<//Review>

I have suffered plantar fasciitis in both feet for years. I heard the advertisement about the Good Feet store on KMJ and in desperation stopped in to see what they had to offer. I purchased their system and in a very short time both of my feet felt normal again. Just finished my first backpack trip in years without pain. Thank you!</review>

Miranda Castro at the visalia location was so caring and very dedicated to her client  come to Visalia and get fitted by her .     I had Dr prescribed inserts had them for 4 yrs just never was right left had issues.  I decided to try goodfeet  inserts . I only purchased the maintainer. And I had 2 weeks of adjustment but it's been 2 months now I feel great and no issues on left foot no longer .  They are expensive for the 3 inserts system but you don't have to buy all three. You can build to the 3 .   Thank you.</review>

< Review>
For 15 years I had horrible foot pain. I've tried many diffrent types of insoles and they helped but never completely took the pain away. For years I would wake up and had to walk on the side of my foot because the pain in my heal was so painful. I went to the good foot store in Fresno and I can honestly say it was the best purchase I made in years! My pain is all but gone. I can walk I can run with no pain at all. I feel such relief but wishing I had gone there years ago.the insoles are durable and will last for years unlike the others I've had that last for a few months.  Beth and jonelle are awsome and a pleasure to deal with. THANK YOU GOOD FEET STORE!<//Review>

<review>This is definitely a spot to go to if you want to take a quick dip in the Pacific ocean! I had the pleasure of walking the frontage of this beach and taking about a 30-minute dip swimming back and forth having a great time! There is also a spot where my buddy got married that you can rent from the city! It's a great idea and I highly recommend this place!</review><Gmap_id>0x80dc03fc27adf2ab:0x2440be8d6d58823e</Gmap_id>< name>

I really wished I got a place near this area. It’s so beautiful and the water is so blue. The only downside to it is that it’s not dog friendly. I would’ve loved to walk my daughter and dog here all the time.<//Review>

< Review>
One of the must see places near San Diego. Come either early in the morning or later in the day to avoid crowds and crazy traffic. Evenings are nicer as the sun comes down.

You’ll be amazed by the cliffs, birds, and sea lions hanging out within just a few feet from people. Be mentally prepared for their smell, haha. Very entertaining and fun for all ages.

Overall, it’s a great place to witness wildlife and enjoy picturesque views of the ocean and cliffs. Sunset makes it even better!< /Review>

<text>Cute shops, great walking paths, beautiful scenery! There isn't a big beach to lay out on due to the tide. The seals and sea lions hang out on the rocks which is cool to see
It is still a gorgeous place and you can't beat the views!< /text></record>

There are lots of sea lions, seals, pelicans, and medium sized black birds here. The views are nice (cliffs overlooking the ocean). At the cove, itself, the animals are a bit far away, as they are down stairs sea level and you're up above (though you can kayak to them). Just down from the cove you can walk down to the water and get very close to the animals plus walk in the sand.< /review>

<review>Beautiful views! First time to California and wanted to see seals and sea lions. I was not disappointed, they were everywhere.

This review is for sightseeing only as I did not use the cove beach area due to time constraints. The water is much colder than the Gulf of Mexico waters I’m use to.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2lC5dlLGNN8A20srwZ8v-tLaJ7u3wscfzFUO6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg-V5CP1XFtkd2bhzEJMTSH7iJdxpjvDJ5c7_g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dc03fc27adf2ab:0x2440be8d6d58823e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We saw over 150 seals and/sea lions. We got soaked on the sea wall and my friend got pooped on by a bird! I rode a Bird scooter and was just a fun afternoon<//Review>

Really beautiful. A lot of wildlife. Fun place to go for lunch or dinner and then take a stroll and see all the sea lions and seals. Wear comfortable shoes if you plan on trying to get close to the sea lions and seals on the rocks etc so you don’t slip or fall. If you’re ever in San Diego this is definitely a place you have to check out.</text>

<text>Great spot to visit! A lot of space, nice little cave and beach spot. When I was here, there were lots of Seals present. You can get pretty close to them to see. It's quite a beautiful spot.

Full disclosure, it was pretty stinky while I was there, probably due to the seals.<//text><rate>5< /rate></record>

Wonderful place to take a romantic stroll, view a sunset and watch people get ridiculously close to wildlife. The area has been rebuilt over the past few years and is now super clean and very nice. Parking is still rough, so if you plan to see a sunset, get there about an hour before sundown.
Also...don't pet the sea lions.< /review>

Beautiful beach but the smell of the decomposing kelp is pretty off-putting and in some areas is unbearable. It would make La Jolla a perfect getaway if somehow that got cleared.

Sunset views were breathtaking.< /review>

I love to soak my soul with the nature and the beach. This place is fun to walk around and watch the seals lying on the shore. Parking is hard to find, of course since it’s always crowded but be patient and you will be fine. Enjoy it.<//Text>

<review>I love coming here in the evening to watch the sunset and seals laying out on the rocks and playing in the ocean waves. I love the sound of the seagulls.

<rating>5< /rating><review>This place is a true gem. Beautiful view of sea..chilling wind..with sleepy..lazy..playful seals and seal ions. Visit early part if morning to avoid crowd. Free parking along the cost is available but tricky to find and you may waste time. If ok to pay then there is paid parking for $4/hr as soon as you enter the area.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-1oAy1Jiwmra7vFIRd7KuWz6h_mgEfkVhS_HT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ1LwvKpLJVWNMc0u1qljRFY2NuWbxnnp-1m0H=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA5-zI9JW6MZ_u4K67x1gaZyy87bEJ6lApF3zI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAL1pkqxpW4jIK_Bnhc9WkhwkMKevtkuKVv51z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5W74tAaqWTrwfBM5gbkJsA_VCzsytUtR720fp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH_pucIguvKil98L2WAXPiFHI-7VblSFxkMVg1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBRyWDtAqo5aXnGbeSQ20edCH47eSgz59GXKVJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyD9rlndtRMth46TXvcJQV7fNQM9kv6WwJSly1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>I was looking for a unique area to take my business card photo and this was it. The views never end, the tide changes and the shore says it all; to new beginnings. #Clydeafornia  La Jolla is the Jewel of San Diego. A true beauty.</review>< Pics>

La Jolla cove is stunning. One of the best ocean front parts of SoCal in my opinion. The beach and opportunities to snorkel are bountiful and something I highly recommend taking advantage of. The weather is always beautiful, the water is beautiful, and there is plenty of shops just up a few flights of stairs</text>

Easy walk from downtown La Jolla. Public bathrooms located at the park are pretty decent. Nice, well marked walking paths. Small beach for swimming. Sea lions enjoy sunning themselves on the rocks.<//Review>

This is the most magical place in all of San Diego. I sat here for 2 hours watching those beautiful seals. There are a lot of idiots that invade their space and touch them. I hope they get seal finger. Almost saw a dumb girl doing a photo shoot get swatted by one. There was a big bomber there I called Cecil. I hope he's enjoying his sea days.<//text>

Beautiful beach and cove, with tide pools, beautiful sea life, and sea shells. The views are gorgeous and there are lots of great spots to sit, relax and watch the tide come in. Very relaxing, natural atmosphere. Also, If you are a yogi or do meditation, this is a great place to do it. This is my go to beach whenever I come to San Diego.<//review>

It’s breathtaking and just a MUST for all who come and visit San Diego, CA. If you’re able to include it as one of your stops through CA then I highly recommend you do it for at least an entire day. The beach is clean, so is the park area. It can be very crowded and parking can be hard to find but if you can get there early enough, you can beat the crazy late afternoon traffic. There are seals that swim near the shore where civilians will be so I suggest if you have children, be careful leaving them unattended. Otherwise, bring your sunscreen, beach attire, BBQ supplies and make it a day at the Cove!<//text><rating>5< /rating>< Gmap_id>

If you Love seals, this is a place to go. They are everywhere and they are very sweet. You can also swim and snorkel with them. Life time experience. And it is wild nature so you don't have to pay for it :)< /Review>

The views are nice. Very calming scenery. Clean area. It's good for picnic area, exercising, jogging, strolling while watching the open view of the beach. I'm sure kids will love this place seeing all those sealions. It gets crowded after 9am. Hard to find parking lot though. Today, I just went to get a piece of my mind. Very peaceful.<//text>

Wonderful experience. Great place to walk along the coast, see giant waves, see wildlife, ge your feet in the ocean.  Wear a swimsuit, even in winter months, the waves are strong, you will get wet!<//Text>

La jolla cove is such a great stop on the way to LOs Angeles from San Diego! It s quiet and great views. Worth spending half an hour just admiring sea lions and pelicans taking a rest on the shores.< /Review>

Little seals everywhere you look and lots of people. This is a great spot to snorkel, scuba, wade, tidepool, or just chill. Definitely not a place if ur looking to surf.<//Review>

<review>Great views of both the ocean and the seals, the place is usually crowded and finding parking can be a pain given the constant flow of vehicles, but overall a great experience. It’s the jewel, indeed.<//review>< Pictures>

Great place to take photos and see pelicans, seals and other wildlife. There's a store with a cave entrance that you can pay money to walk through to get down near the water.<//review>

< Review>
One of my favorite places in San Diego! Love to come here and walk out on the walkway into the ocean 🌊 so peaceful and relaxing. Love the sea lions can walk pretty close to them it’s a pretty neat experience for everyone to experience I think. If you ever go to San Diego I recommend you coming her and checking it out. My kids love it as well . Just to sit with your husband and family and listen to the waves and watch the sunset 🌅 is the best experience ever!!!< /Review>

<Review>Beautiful view of the shore. Seals abound the place and are 'communicating' with people. It has an elevated shoreline, a cliff. You have to go down cautiously stepping on big rocks to reach the shore, which in a sense is a good shelter for the seals coming on shore.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Absolutely beautiful place with an abundance of wildlife. LJC has it all to include sea lions, exotic birds and whales. There is also a very cool running trail nearby that takes runners next to cliffs on the ocean, amazing.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dc03fc27adf2ab:0x2440be8d6d58823e</GmapID><response>None< /response>< user_id>

Just a beautiful area. Parking may be a little difficult to get if you go after 10am, but if you go to early, the fog may block your views of the ocean.  The seals and sea lions are the main attraction for us.</text>

<text>I have to leave a review because this place is AMAZING but it was heartbreaking to see some of the treatment to the sea lions/ seals. There were so many sea pups and young lions that people were getting VERY close to, touching, and throwing sand at, despite NUMEROUS warning signs posted that pups can be abandoned if humans get too close. It was such a gift to see sea life so close, but it's not worth it when these animals are in jeopardy. :(<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because of the lack of parking in the vicinity and also how expensive the pay-parking is with the options available. I feel it can be handled better. Otherwise, you get a beautiful view of the ocean. You get to watch the sea lions and seals. The small beach looks very pretty.< /Review>

And seeing the pelicans, the sea lions and other wildlife just chilling in the sun makes me happy. My favourite time to go: March, April. The colours are fabulous with a display of nuances of blue, green and all the colours of the flowers. I really recommend a stop there :)</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

La Jolla Cove is the most picturesque place we have ever visited. As a cove this is a small circular bay, providing protected area to colourful marine life. Beautifully surrounded by the cliffs, it’s widely famous for snorkeling, scuba diving, surfing and many more activities.< /Text>

Great park and beach right in the Village of La Jolla.  This is a very popular spot, so it was crowded but well-maintained and clean.  Nice park setting with open grass and a walkway along the sea cliff.  Stairways leading down to a small beach with good opportunities for snorkeling or diving.</review>

<Text>There is a parking lot at the top of the cove, but it fills up quickly. Street parking is available (with a 2-hour limit) along Prospect and Coast Blvd as well.

You can walk along the cliffs or there are stairs leading down to the sandy cove.<//Text>< Date>

great location, but it’s best to visit in the fall. the weather is still good and most of the tourists have left. excellent for shopping up in town, if you’d like to drop some serious cash.<//review>

Such a beautiful and relaxing place. I fell asleep as my husband, son and his friend played in the water. It temporarily overwhelmed my senses enough to dull the pain in my body as I soaked up the positive energy there. 😁<//text>

Plan on at least 30 minutes and 3 loops to be able to find parking in this area. The seals are a site to see and if you’re lucky you’ll even see a sea lion trying to establish it’s dominance. Not a place you want to go on a romantic date to....smells like the bathrooms haven’t been cleaned there in years. Guess the sea lions haven’t heard of  fabreeze yet😂< /Text>

<review>This was the first time I had been back to La Jollas beaches in more than a decade. Google maps took me to a street where there was parking and it also served as an overlook to where the seals / sea lions rest and play. This street also features the crab catcher restaurant along with access to Eddie V's via a long staircase. There were no wildlife to see besides the birds and they smelled horrible. Access to the cave was through a shop so I wasn't sure if it costs money or if it was public access, I think that information should've been more clear. Either way, it was nice out and the walk was nice.</review><Date>1545151108221< /Date><resp>None</resp>< rating>

<Review>THE COVE IS FOR EVERYONE! You can lay up on the shore or walk the park. Seals 💛are always there to say hello.(Don't get to close) The water looks great plus there's benches everywhere so you can watch the waves. And if you want to shop and eat, places are across the way.</Review>< pics>

Beautiful place this is! Getting parking might be difficult but once you get it, you should walk and go down and see! You can see many seals. Also, when the tide is low, there is a small thin structure made just for people to walk in that! It’s really nice!<//review>

<Review>Very beautiful and relaxing place for tourists and for a weekly basis visits. Views are superb,  sir is so fresh and healthy. Lot of activities can be done over there. This is beside that you can take the best photos shoots there. Restaurants as well have all kind of delicious foods, ice creams,  wine and beers. You will not be able to get enough  from going there week after week. It's really an amazing place to spend time and more<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dc03fc27adf2ab:0x2440be8d6d58823e<//GmapID></record>

We took our first trip here and just stayed on the walks by the road.  The good is lots of wildlife like birds and seals, and you can see things quickly.
The bad is parking, the beach looked crowded, and it smelled pretty awful.  Wildlife and people were very close swimming feet from one another.

I recommend going but be prepared for parking.< /Text>

Gorgeous scenery, lots of seals and sea lions. Free parking can be hard to find. I dropped my family off at the far north end then parked at the far south end where more is available. I ran back to meet up with them and we took our time walking back to the vehicle.< /Text>

Beautiful...only issue is parking and the stairs. I am handicapped so for me I couldn't go down to the beach but it was still  breath taking.<//review>

<review>One of my favorite attractions to take my friends who visit san diego. The seals and sea lions are special and the scenery is beautiful. You can rent snorkels and kayaks and enjoy it from the water as well. Parking can be tough so we just park up in the village. People are usually hanging out or playing in the grass.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc03fc27adf2ab:0x2440be8d6d58823e<//Gmap_id></record>

If you want to see sea lions and seals up close this is the best beach to come too. La Jolla beach and downtown is famous for its art galleries and fine dinning.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It is one of the most beautiful places I have been, it is one of the mandatory stops that must be made in San Diego. In addition to the beautiful view of you can see animals very closely and you can interact with them and take beautiful photos. Important to go early to get parking. Also use sunscreen as the sun is very strong.

(Original)
Es uno de los lugares más hermosos que he ido,  es una de las paradas obligatorias que se tiene que hacer en San Diego. Además de la hermosa vista de puede apreciar de muy cerca los animales y se puede interactuar con ellos y tomarse hermosas fotos. Importante ir temprano para poder conseguir parqueo. También usar bloqueador ya que el sol es muy fuerte.< /review>

The food is great here. May have to wait a little bit in case if you order a large amount of items from the menu, but it's always worth. The items I recommend the most are pork bao, melty cheese pork bao, pork & takana dumplings, and the chicken sandwich.</text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Tried the cheese nikuman with pork, gyoza, and crab fried rice. The pork was very juicy and finely chopped so it stays soft and wonderful almost like eating those shao lung bao. I came back the next day for seconds. Decent portions, it's a nice take on chuka.  Better to eat there though, unless you live really close by.<//text>< pictures>

Good sub, nice people. The person even wiped down the slicer for our vegetarian sandwich. I wish they had a few more options to put on the sandwiches, but that's a company wide issue, has nothing to do with this particular store.</Review>

1st time to any Jersey Mikes. Turkey  provolone on rosemary bread  was surprisingly very good. Service was great. Until Black Karen felt she needed special treatment by demanding the entire crew changes gloves and sanitize all equipment before making her sandwich..uncalled for.< /Review>

She cares about her customers and is warm and pays attention to detail. She literally has my sandwich memorized.

<text>Good sandwich but good grief the prices. $16 for a Italian sandwich I can get the equivalent size at subway for half the price. After chips and a drink you’re looking at $20 for a flippin sandwich. I can go to a nice restaurant for cheaper. I won’t be back. Too expensive.< /text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Bread was too hard. One high chair at this place and it had a broken strap. Not at all safe but the only option when I have a 8 month old. And usually I use two high chairs one for the 8 month old and one for my 2 year old and my 4yr old sorts at the chair.</Review>

I have yet to try more then 4 or 5 selections from the menu.. And yes they're more expensive here than say Subway, but again in my opinion well worth it...<//review>< pictures>

<text>I enjoy the turkey sandwich with nice flaky bread.  I just wish they could figure out a "really light splash of oil and vinegar" isn't two splashes of their generous bottles.  I have found this happens at all their locations though and partly blame the bottle tops they have on those things.< /text></record>

The sandwiches are as always at Jersey Mike's great. My family loves eating there and we were stopping through on our way home with my wife and 3 kids. The girl who took our order was really rushing us.. and we knew pretty much exactly what we wanted. When my wife went to say it would be lettuce only on my kids wrap she cut her off and said ok we will do that over there I just need your orders (with a bit of an attitude). So we finished our order, my wife does not like blue cheese and was getting a buffalo chicken wrap so she waited as she had already been cut off trying to customize the order. They finished the kids and my orders and my wife noticed the other sandwich make was making hers by the grill. By this time it was already too late.. we were in a hurry and my wife was being polite and said it was fine. She is nicer than I am.. but anyways. The blonde skinny girl working has quite the attitude. I could understand being rushed a little if it was packed but at the time of ordering we were the only people on the Restraunt. I've been to a lot of Jersey Mike's locations and this was the only.time I've had a negative experience. The 2 stars are only because the other girl working was nice and the food was great.< /text>

<review>Don't go. They don't know how to run a business. They ran out of bread (yes, bread) and kept the store open so that people parked, walked in, studied the menu, only to be told they don't have bread to make sandwiches. If they fail so hard in this regard I can only imagine what cleanliness and food safety failures are going on.</review><gmap_id>0x80dc829c4f93b869:0xa10ab33b8cff768a< /gmap_id>< rating>

The tasting room is beautifully decorated, the hostess is nice, the music is easy to hear at the right pace, tasty bread, and to complete the experience, of course, a fine wine. I'll stop by more often when I have time.<//Review>< pictures>

Overall, I am super impressed with this bar!  My boyfriend & I came in right at 5pm for some happy hour on the way out of downtown back to The Valley.  We stumbled upon this gem by searching the Yelp map and it was an easy pit stop off the freeway.  The reviews truly are an honest testament to the service, ambiance, and overall experience.  Drinks are killer, music is choice, atop provoking conversations with the staff.  Clean bar and restrooms.  Daniel is engaging and was inquisitive to learn my and my bf's preferences.  Marcial was conversational in sharing the history of the bar.  Only these famous last words come to mind: "I will be back!"</Review>

It is a unique place to have good time with friends over a few glasses of wine and beer.  You can bring your own food.  The owner, Joseph, is very kind and generous and the atmosphere is fantastic.

I've been a bunch of times. I didn't think about writing a review until now though. It's great. That's probably the best term. It's my after work hangout, because I can still talk to my friends with the music in the background, get a great drink, not too spendy and don't have to wait.<//text>

<Review>Really?! I haven't reviewed this place before? Strange, since this was one of my go-to spots when I first moved to SF.

I've been to trivia night a few times back in the day and always had a good time even though I think the games are rigged. Can someone really know that much baseball trivia?

Anyway, the service can be up or down but overall it's a good time here.

Even though I'm not the biggest fan of Irish pubs, this one is A-O-K!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
The menu is vast and varying, comprised of mostly rum-based drinks, but including a sprinkling of some based in other major spirits, as well. One of my favorite aspects is that each drink is shown with the silhouette of the glass it comes in (usually coupe, tallboy, or tumbler) next to it to help you picture what you'll get. Each drink we've had has been delicious, whether it's been sweet, smoky, strong, citrusy, or a complex combination of the above. I can't wait to return on my next trip to SF!< /Review>

The spot is much smaller than I expected but we were lucky to grab seats (it was a bit early on a Friday night). We ended up ordering about 4 drinks together and I really enjoyed them all! The drinks are fairly priced and delicious! I was expecting something super sweet but was pleasantly surprised to find well-balanced and decently strong drinks.< /text>

<text>Came here with close buddies and didn't have to wait long to get seated.  It was the third place we went to because the other ones were too crowded or loud. The cheesy tater tots are delish. The drinks are strong and there's a large variety of cocktails. I've been here three times and the service is always amazing especially this time with Jen. Highly recommend. Celebrities even come here so there's some local color.<//text>< name>

Food is not great, but drinks are really good and the ambiance is worth experiencing. Also converts to a dance club at night. Great place to go if you're tired of run of the mill, headache-inducing club music. Bissap's playlist is a lot more eclectic and engaging. :D</text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Went here for my birthday, emailed in advance to reserve a table in the front room for my friends at no cost! It was such a good decision, gave us a break from the dancing in the back room and a chill place to hang out with a drink and have fun!</Review>< pics>

It was my first time at the Well last night- and I really enjoyed it.  Music was great, not too crowded and the crowd was really good too.It didnt take too long to get a drink and it wasn't too crowded for a Friday night.< /Text>

<Text>So I feel like a lot of people would enjoy this spot and the drinks it has to offer. The drinks are visually pretty and a lot have coconut cream, YUM LOL. It is another pretty cool "themed" bar in the city.< /Text><Name>Angela Hall<//Name><Pics>None</Pics><gmap_id>0x80c2c64b3c7f4307:0x363fab566c4d85a6<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Trendy bar with a really fun crowd everytime I go there. The bar is divided into separate areas and 2 floors so lots of different areas to hang around there. The music is also pretty cool and in the weekend it turns into what you could call almost a club with folks dancing all over the place.< /review>

This place has lots of arcade games and for cheap! The food is definitely good with great portions.  The alcohol is a little bit pricey compared to other places but still had fun.  I like how open the area is with an upstairs bar as well.  Must check this place out if your into arcade games and some drinks.<//Text>

Good food, Good drinks . I love their menu and they have happy hour low price food as well. Service is a bit slow . Couple it waitresses there have a very bad attitude as if they hope to be doctors but some one forced them to wait tables !! One is rude and I'm surprised she hasn't been fired yet .<//Review>

<Text>Visiting from out of town and attending a birthday party there, someone associated with the birthday person brought two bottles of alcohol into the establishment as a gift. With approximately 15 folks, the birthday guy opened the bottles and poured a drink for several members. The bottles were rather small but each person who accepted received 1 glass and the bottles were emptied. The gift givers then left the establishment. Approximately 15 minutes later, one of the security staff had noticed one of the empty bottles and identified it as not being purchased at the clubs bar. He was visibly upset and called several other security staff over. The Birthday person explained the situation, apologized and instructed members of his party to purchase drinks from the bar. That obviously wasn't good enough for the staff. I (didn't have any drinks) asked the staff member proper policy and he stated "outside alcohol is not allowed here" I then asked "well how did it get past door security?" The security staff then went to get the black lady who was working the door to show her what had transpired as a result of her lack of proper protocol when allowing folks into the establishment. Instead of her admitting fault and just moving on, she started placing blame on everyone including myself (remember I didn't have any drinks nor did I know any of the folks involved other than the birthday guy). After her terrible acting job at being upset, the security staff huddled away and decided to ask us to all leave. Mind you, all the guys in our group were over 6 feet 200 lbs.. one of the females who had just arrived after the situation to this point asked why she was asked to leave and she was "manhandled" and jerked/led/pushed out of the club, I then realized that these staff were nothing more than unintelligent cowards at this point. I asked why I had to leave when I didn't consume any of the "prohibited alcohol" and they offered no excuse (nor did they bother to put their paws on me like they did the little lady). I kindly thanked the group for the invite and encouraged them to leave and they did so without further incident.  My advice to the club manager is to train your staff (especially the door staff) to not allow outside items into the establishment. If items such as outside bottles of alcohol as gifts are allowed in, place them behind the bar area (storage) and allow the receiver of the gift to retrieve when they leave for the evening... most importantly, admit fault when you are wrong... I was angry a bit and started to create club flyers and promote in areas like Compton and Watts, even sponsor transportation for "those folks" to attend the club possibly on a regular basis. Club LR staff I'm back in Texas and a bit disappointed that my last night in LA went like this, but it's all good now. If any of you are in Houston, look me up and I'll gladly show you some nice nightclubs when people use common sense, are not over dramatic and most importantly are able to handle situations as they come up accordingly.

<Review>Been to this bar a couple times, the vibe isn't too bad. The drinks were fairly priced between 10-15$, but the drinks aren't too crazy good. The service needs a bit of improvement.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2c64b3c7f4307:0x363fab566c4d85a6< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

There's always a cover charge of $10 which isn't too bad, but the vibe is more for older people like 45+ .</Text>

This is the best place to get burritos, tortas, tacos & more! He even makes vegetarian burritos! The flavors are authentic & in these past 16 yrs he has never failed to fully satisfy our hunger. We love Ramons taco shop! ❤ At el campo market. 😁</Review>

<Text>If I could give a ZERO star, I would.

My complaint is that they are in the business of ripping people off.

I had ordered food from the taco truck next door (which by the way was horrible) and was told that they don't accept debit/credit card so I had to go to this store to get cash back. I went in the store and grabbed a small can of Pepsi and asked for $25 cash back. The total transaction was about $29 and I remember thinking, dang... I paid $4 for this small can of soda. Well, I just checked my bank account and it shows that I requested $27 cash back (I asked for $25 and got $25). I know it's only $2 but if they do this to every person that goes in there, that adds up. They gave me $25 and put $2 in their pockets.

Just Beware!</Text>< pictures>

I enjoy the cold drinks at the store, but the best thing is that it's conveniently located next to a taco truck, they make some really tasty tacos and also have a vegetarian menu!! I will definitely be going again and highly recommend!!!< /text>

They have Cafe de Olla here. Never knew what that was until today. I'm just passing through and do not frequent this location. The cashier is super nice and the facility is clean. Expected for being close to Calabasas/Malibu. Good location.</text>

(Translated by Google) It's a gas station with a beautiful inside inside.
There are many types of coffee at a moderate price.
The beautiful taco is like everyone, although the waitress is very friendly and bilingual.
The price of gasoline like all of the area.

(Original)
És una gasolinera amb un taco bell a dins.
Hi ha molts tipus de cafè a preu moderat.
El taco bell és com tots, tot i que la cambrera és molt simpàtica i bilingüe.

I bought a laptop in early February and had to call because the computer would not even start.  As it turned out, the hard drive was not plugged in so they helped me put it together over the phone when I called them. They also said they would give me a part so the hard drive would stay connected.  Because the refurbished computer wasn't even functioning when I got it I decided that I would return the computer so I called them back where they informed me that I would have to pay to ship it back.  No where on the Walmart site does it say this.  For returns it states that you have a 15 day return policy.  There is no mention of paying for shipping the laptop back or a restocking fee.  I also returned the computer 9 days after I received it.  When I called them I explained I was not happy that I got a laptop that apparently was not checked before it was sent out otherwise it would have worked when I got it.  When I called to get a refund they said it would be 24-48 hours after this phone call so after a week I noticed that I was not refunded I had to call again for them to get some sort of clearance to get a refund. I feel that if you are going to charge people a restocking fee you should let people know.  I paid $259 for the computer and after I paid for shipping and the restocking fee I have lost $80 to this horrible company.   If I could give a -5 review I would.  I am not sure how you can charge a 20% restocking fee especially when you sent out a defective product in the first place.  Never again would I ever use this company for anything.< /review>

I called for a Graphics card which is around 8-1k depending on the card. The guy on the phone said they had a lot so asked how much and he said they were 1500 for the cheapest. Just WOW! This place is part of the problem why so many can’t get anything. SCALPING AT ITS FINEST! If you looking for a card just get a custom pre build there’s plenty around with a fair price.<//review>

<UserId.>106621549771040376114< /UserId.><Review>The worst online buying experience I've ever had. The laptop was defective, They tried everything they could to keep me from returning it. I bought a second laptop to use while the first was being returned. I was told I wasn't allowed to simply return it. The process took months, they made me pay for the shipping and a restocking fee (about $50 overall). I had to call several times to ask for a refund, weeks after the laptop was received. Rude and dishonest. You're better off with no computer than one from ASN Depot.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Read these reviews carefully - this is not a coincidence that so many people complain about the online buying experience.  These folks hide behind the Walmart Brand, then provide an awful customer experience - refusing to accept returns, stating a 15-day return policy.  When has any company ever had a 15 day return policy for an online purchase?!?  Totally unethical, and passive aggressive.  Avoid at all costs.</text>

<text>Very demeaning customer service. Salman has a corrupt attitude, and tries to make shady side deals and charges you extra fees, I would give this unpleasant character zero stars if I could. Salman calls you with pressuring sales tactic to have you spend more money on upgrades. He sent a couple computers with missing hardware and no OS. I can only imagine what shady deal these computers come from, in a dark alley at 3 in the morning is my best guess.  I tried to explain to him I wanted to send them back and he verbally attack me and wouldn't let me talk, wouldn't hear me out, over talking me. Be very careful he will call you and  try to make side deals for equipment upgrades with him, and have you make payments through PayPal which is not connected to the original Wal-Mart market place that the order was place. It will cause problems later if you need to return and request a full refund. If you notice that a majority of his reviews are from people that have negative reviews with similar situations like my own, is he terrible at treating his customers with any respect? I would think so. My advice to people who are looking for good quality used computers and don't want to be ripped off, stay away from this shady guy, he is bad news. FYI, I sent back his computers and to this day I have not seen my full refund.< /text>< Pictures>

<name>Lordescissorhand<//name><date>1609796104412</date><rate>1</rate><Text>In April of 2020 I had reached out to a post on Facebook about computer repair. I got an immediate response from David Alvarez he stated that he would be able upgrade my computer. I requested that I wanted to upgrade the SSD the RAM and the Battery of my MacBook Pro.

I met David at ASN Depot he came outside and met me I thought because of Covid-19 regulations. Within a day in a half David has my computer completed. I went to David’s house to pick up my computer. David made me wait over an hour before bringing my computer.

Within days of receiving my computer I noticed the battery would deplete within an hour or two. I had reached out to David on numerous occasions over the next 8 months about the battery. David offered very little communication nor and explication as to why my battery was declining so rapidly.

I called the store ASN Depot where I was under the assumption I had business with to ask about the warranty replacement for the battery. The person on the phone had no idea who I was nor did I actually do business with them.

David immediately reached out to me and stated that, that was his job and that if I needed anything to contact him directly. Funny thing is he acted as if it was his store originally. Still until this day David has not replaced my battery I no longer feel comfortable with him working on my computer. I will be reaching out to the BBB about this issue.<//Text>< Pics>

I didn’t want to give any stars at all due to the fact I paid for a all chrome laptop and they sent me whatever they had which was not what I ordered . Then spoke to a customer service rep Solomon who was not at all caring nor added any type of compensation and or credit due to me getting the wrong order so I’m highly upset and will get in contact with the bbb as well to make sure they are aware and of my dissatisfaction just terrible 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾< /review>

< Review>
I purchased a computer from ASN through Walmart marketplace. It appeared fine but then I turned it on and the screen was glitching. We called to discuss returning it as the flyer inside asked us to contact them instead of going through Walmart for the return. We were told it had to be returned that day because apparently they don't accept returns after 15 days. (Nothing about that in the information with the computer or at the time of the purchase.) We had been out of town and just returned so we barely met the cutoff. They received the computer back and it took them more than a week and a phone call to issue my refund... well part of it anyways. They kept 20% of my refund... apparently a restocking fee that we had not been made aware of. $77 to put a broken computer back on the shelf??? I'm assuming they want you to go through them for the refund instead of Walmart so they can keep part of your money and so Walmart doesn't know how awful of a business they are. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS BUSINESS!!!  Seeing the other reviews makes me wonder how this company is still in business.< /Review>

Be careful when buying something from this company. They send you the broken computers and then they say to return it, which you will come to pay twice in shipping and handling charges. I bought a refurniched laptop but it came to me it was a used laptop with scratches and a broken screen and they never told me the details it had. I arrive with a broken screen. They are swindlers and thieves. If they had told me that I would not have bought it. What bothers me most is that the owner said that this is normal when you buy a computer of that type. That is a lie because on ebay and amazon they tell you the problems that the computer has before buying it, I refer to the tests.</review>

Purchased a refurbished computer thru Walmart.  I knew it would be refurbished and was comfortable with that kind or purchase.  The price was great. The computer was better than expected, looks and performs like new.  There was a small settings issue which staff took care of quickly and courteously.  Very satisfied customer.<//text>

I returned a computer because it was in bad condition and defective and the person who treated me very rudely told me that for a long time they only gave me 80 percent of the refund. It is the worst I have seen for sale in the United States, I do not recommend it at all.<//text>

This company is a fraud. Not only did they send me a computer that was 7 years older than the image displayed on the Walmart website, they also had the package re-routed away from their facility to avoid issuing me a refund, when I shipped the product back to them. I will likely have to file suit against this company and Walmart to recover my loss.<//text>

Super happy I found this ASN computer store in Chino Hills. I purchased an awesome used Mac desktop from these guys. They were super helpful in helping me choose the right Mac computer for what I need. The computer works great!! It also saved me tons of money from purchasing a new one. Thanks so much for your great service!!</Review>

ASN Depot is one of the best places to shop for a new computer, fit for any use. They have anything from home and work laptops, to gaming desktops and notebooks. Everything is custom made and built to perfection, and the durability of their products is unimaginable. Their products will last you at least four years with good use, which is a great plus in my book. I was completely satisfied with their product, service and pricing, and I would highly recommend them to anybody. Their repairs group is also top notch.

All of the staff at ASN Depot are very knowledgeable of computing technology altogether, and they are all competent and more than capable   of doing what they do at this amazing place. None of the advice and products I have received from this place have ever let me down; they have always made me more than satisfied. This is one of the very few private businesses that excel in what they do and perform more than the expected. I personally have never found any place I was more satisfied with than ASN Depot; their products and what they do is definitely worthy of experiencing.<//Review>

I needed a cooler for my CPU. I asked if they had any Noctua or any with 140MM fans. I was told on the phone they had 4-5 different ones. When I got there they had cheap small coolers or $200 water coolers < $130 at BB or $120 on amazon. All they seem to carry is used junk in the store. I do not like being lied to just to get me in the door.< /Review>

<Review>These guys are  for real. I live in the area so I even went to their store to check them out. Bought a souped up refurbed e6440 on line (they have to configure to your order, i7, big ssd, etc). Arrived looking brand new & equipped as agreed. Had trouble with charging the battery (only go up to 19%). They sent a new charger but suspected it would not solve the problem. It did not. Incidentally they don't guarantee batteries but this was something else.Sent back the machine and they repaired it and returned without charge under the 90-day warranty. You can buy an extended warranty if you're going to haul around your laptop. You also get personalized service. Talk to Salman with your order and questions.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Reporting you to walmart you sell through and to Better Business. The computer you advertised and sold on walmart was NOT the same one you sent. It arrived with a broken cord, was missing items and camera, ive called and left messages with no return. Now after only a cpl months of having your scam computer the windows is "Expired". Company and computer is a SCAM do not trust them.<//Text>

<Text>If I could give them 0 stars then I would. Sent me the wrong item. Then it only lasted a short time. Made me purchase another laptop since I couldn't go without one for a few days. Ended up that it took almost 1 week for them to get it in the mail. I finally get the new one - I mailed out the old one the next morning. They had told me that they would return my money thru paypal - the form that I used to buy the 2nd computer. They changed their minds, insisting that I misunderstood...I didn't...I was very clear in my question originally and then the day I sent the old one back. They are now just going to credit my walmart card...my original form of payment. I will never purchase anything thru any site from them and I discourage anyone else from doing so.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Well as someone who doesn't really do reviews I had to give one to ASN especially to the representative Mos! I'm not tech savvy at all but being a broke college student I had no choice but to buy a laptop that would do the job. Not only did Mos explain to me thoroughly how laptops work and what I would need, I wasnt pressured into buying what I didn't need and was both given a discount and encouraged to come back with any problems or help needed! I have always believed to be loyal to the right people when they reciprocate trust and respect and I do believe Mos and the people at ASN have done just that! Will definitely come back for all my tech buys! Thanks again ASN!< /Review>

Three years ago I bought a computer tower and a laptop from this business.  they still work and my tower got a virus recently but they repaired it right away and made the computer better then what it was.  The employees are very friendly.  I recommend anyone to this business for any computer or gaming problems.<//Review>

Was just in here from shipping back a bad ram kit I got off amazon, and decided to check this place out and decided to pick up a kit for a system build I'm doing for a client, techs were quite helpful and friendly.

However, their prices are pretty high the RAM kit I bought I asked he said $95 (which he's pricing per DIMM module in the kit, I understood that.) Add the second DIMM in the dual channel kit $95+$95=$190+(7.75%)=$14.72+$180=$204.72 for the dual channel I needed it right away for a build I finished but the RAM kit I ordered I had to ship back due to a bad module. I could've bought the exact kit for 30% cheaper off Amazon but I couldn't wait for shipping.

Lower the prices a bit and I'll be a regular otherwise I'll just go on Amazon or down to fry's or microcenter for parts.

I know you just sell parts and systems on the side and your main gig are repairs and virus removal. But your parts pricing can be a bit more reasonable.<//Review>

<review>I wanted a high-end laptop to use while traveling and have had good luck with Dell products, both new and refurbished. ASN Depot had exactly what I wanted in a refurbished unit and offered some upgrade options. I contacted them several times with questions and their responses were always very prompt and courteous, even for dumb questions (I'd missed the answer in the description.)
When I got the laptop, it was perfect -- looked brand new and had exactly the upgrades I'd ordered. Except for one thing: I'd requested Windows 7 to be installed, and it came with Windows 8.1. An easy thing to overlook, as it had been early in our email chain when I had requested that.  This sort of thing has happened to me a number of times, and while not ideal, I can see how it could easily happen in our fast-paced society. As long as they make it right and time isn't an issue, I'm OK with it.
I contacted them and offered to install it myself if they'd send me the software. Understandably, they preferred to do it themselves to make sure it was done right, so paid for shipping both ways.
I got to thinking, I want to install Linux on this machine, maybe they'd be willing to make a couple of changes to make that process easier! And they did:
Guys, can you set up the BIOS to use legacy booting instead of UEFI? Sure, no problem.
How about repartitioning the boot drive to only use half of it for Windows 7, so I don't have to shrink the partition later? No problem.
How about turning off any fast boot options to avoid possible problems when shutting down Windows, booting Linux, making changes, then rebooting Windows? Done.
They called me when they were doing those changes to verify that they did exactly what I wanted, and they did. Exactly.
Excellent customer service, and always courteous. I'm a happy camper, the system is awesome, and I absolutely wouldn't hesitate to order from them again.<//review>< Pics>

I had a great experience at ASN. I've built a computer after buying the parts here when I was 14 years old ~ 10 years ago. It was my first gaming rig and boy could it hang! I then bought an ASUS laptop 4 years ago that was extremely powerful and only cost me about $700. It was powerful enough to run the latest games at the time, including Crysis 3 and still be quiet enough for school work. Recently a friend of mine build a monster computer, and he has been running games like PUBG and Overwatch at over 100 FPS all for a crazy bargain. I'm thinking of stopping by and upgrading my HP Omen with some rams, an SSD, and maybe a 1060Ti from these guys because I know they have the latest in stock. Thanks Sully and Sharif!<//Text>

<review>Salman, the owner at ASN Depot sold me a used, Dell M6800 top-of-the-line laptop for $2941 claiming it had a 1 year warranty thru Dell authorized Service Centers. It did not. The s/n he sold me was stolen from Dell, according to Dell and Dell would not service it nor provide any support under any circumstances, despite that I was an innocent victim. When I had technical problems, ASN agreed to repair it, but promised 100% to not write to my SSD hard drive. Instead, they reinstalled windows, which erased more than 2 weeks of dozens of sophisticated engineering applications that I had initially installed. The fingerprint reader still did not work. Again, he told me he refused to refund my money (even though the laptop was in exactly the same cosmetic condition as when i got it) because he "didn't have to". I was stuck with a laptop that I couldn't get service on. For the fingerprint reader, only Dell can provide support for that in case of most problems and they weren't helping me. I asked Amazon for a refund and they denied the claim initially, then after appeal, they refunded my money since the claim was valid. I highly recommend that you do not do business with ASN. You will likely be ripped-off as I was. You have been warned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have no reason to lie as I have been made whole by Amazon and AMX.
Finally, if you read most all of the reviews, it is obvious they were written by the owner or his cohorts. Look at the wording and language and the content. For example, who submits a review after buying a computer 3 years prior? There are many like this. They all give glowing reviews with not one word of any problem at all. This is very unrealistic. Even a glowing review will often have some small negative point. But not any of these. Please see for yourself.<//review>< Resp>
{'time': 1458016304430, 'text': 'Although I don\'t like to discuss these publically  but in this case I will make an exception.  The computer was and advertised as used on Amazon. The warranty is one year and can be serviced by Us and the third party warranty company which contracts with the maitacturer also.  Furthermore, we did check your system when you brought it to our store and found unlicensed software. The system was thoroughly tested,. The problem on the system was corrupt software not hardware . Warranty covers hardware not software. Yet we went beyond this and offered to format and reinstall operating system which the customer denied due to not having the unlicensed software.  A public lookup of serial number on Dell shows the system on Dell\'s  database as well as the express code that matches. " stolen" systems will not have that in my opinion.  You also left the part out where you have kept the system over 4 months and have not returned it to us and yet you have received money back.  Which in turn makes you in possession of property that does not belong to you.  We have offered help from the day one even though the software issues and corruptions are not covered by any warranty.\nWe have been in business for 15 years and are a very reputable firm.  We are here to help should you choose to accept it.  But we cannot help you diagnose third party unlicensed software corruption, and that we did inform you and Amazon alike.\nSo having said that I do recommend you revise this as we do reserve the right to follow up recovering the property that belongs to us at the moment.  We would also love to see the proof of your claims that somehow we sold a "stolen" laptop.\n\nLastly, our conduct and professionalism is public and false acquisitions and defaming our public record will no longer be tolerated.\n\nShould you wish to work with us in a professional manner, we will welcome you.\n\nSincerely,\nASN depot inc.'}< /Resp>

I will definitely come to ASN Depot, Inc. with future computer needs. They were so helpful in fixing my laptop. They explained all my options and broke down the price. They did not try to upsale anything and helped my make the best decision for my needs. I'm very satisfied with the service here. Thank you!</text>

<text>I guess the lady thought I was going to steal, as soon as I walked down the aisle she sent someone to watch me. So I decided to just stand want watch him....he was 100% doing nothing but watching ME. Then I find the item I'm looking for and it rings up $2 more than the posted price..same lady tells me that prices aren't as marked,  the price is whatever it rings up. When I threatened her with the county she fixed it. I'll never go back to this ghetto establishment.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<text>This Ragin' Cajun girl Loves this store😍!  From Peanut Patties to Bayou Chef or Zatarans products to Cajun spices- Rainbow Market has whatever you need to prepare your traditional southern dishes. If you like cracklin' or boudin (try the crawfish boudin) indigenous to the Parrish region,  they sell it frozen...you won't be disappointed. What lacks in aesthetic and decor, this mom and pop establishment has been selling Louisiana staples for years at a reasonable price👌.< /text></record>

<Review>The store is not really clean, and the meat smells pretty bad! But they do have a good selection of Louisiana/Cajun/Creole products that are hard to find. Kinda like Tony's in Baton Rouge. But a knock off version. And, they sell Lotto!!</Review>< Pictures>

This place is the worst place to buy anyting.. aside from them selling old rotten meat, expired eggs, and combining hearts gizzards and rejected meat with small amounts of beef ground up to be sold as ground beef!! My wife worked at this place for a few weeks and could not bear the horror and when she was asking them to stop doing this she was fired.<//Text>
<pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1592528828774, 'text': 'She\'s your "wife?" Well, than she lied on her application as she stated for her payroll as "single" god knows what more lies she fed us.  First off, she was not fired, she verbally quit and left with anger and you making these false claims can have consequences for you so I would be very careful what you state. These ridiculous claims is a form of retaliation out of anger.  We have had longstanding customers and employees who have returned for the quality of our meat and other items.   She only worked for us under two weeks and displayed nothing but  disturbing and emotionally unstable behavior. Despite of that, we did not take action as of yet until the day she acted out and stated she can\'t work here anymore and we weren\'t going to convince her otherwise.  She sent  a number of obscured messages attacking, blackmailing and threatening us claiming that she "works for the city" LOL. Just by her uneducated form of communication and behavior via text confirms her claim as false, a long with she "gets paid to go to businesses and see how they are running their stores"  threatening to report us while we are a grade A.  Than, she continues withe her exasperated text messages and apologizes to me in her for being rude after making threats and than expressing interest to come back to work again and start all over again?!!  This display of emotionally and mentally unstable person, would never be considered for rehire.  Her behavior is unjustifiable and unacceptable for any workplace.  We wish her well.'}<//resp>< gmapID>

Rainbow Supermarket has been around a very long time. It's also a landmark for that area. I know you could buy lunch or dinner out the store. I don't know if they still sale dinners but I know their still around.</Review>

I've shopped here for years and I swear they change management like crazy! The lead butcher is rude and their meat is inexpensive but I dont believe it's fresh...Managers yelling at staff members in front of the customers. Prices are ridiculously high on other items. It wasn't always like this!< /review>

What an experience!!!

I haven’t been to sizzler since I was a lil kid! I went last Thursday because all the other restaurants we wanted to go too we’re had long waits. It was late after a graduation.

We sat down got a high chair for my 2 year old we noticed it was dirty so we asked was it sanitize the waitress said yes EVERY NIGHT! LOL so we all looked and said well it’s 8 at night was it cleaned today she said no but kids have came in but if WE want WE can go to table “over there and use the peroxide water!!!! I was so through!!

So the manager came by and we asked her she was like oh I can clean it for you, I said wow the waitress said we had to she said oh no I’m so sorry’ that’s not your job.

That was that the food came out about 1 hour later why I don’t know because it was only 3 other families in there with us! The food arrived cold!!! We all left with food on our plates! Fried shrimp was cold! Fries cold! Shrimp skewers undercooked and cold! Food in my sons and mother n laws cup! Stuck on the cup. Soup cup was dirty! I had all 12 chicken wings left because that was cold!  Steaks was not done! Lobster wasn’t done! Just gross!!! Bread was cold thin! I mean everything about that night in sizzler was pathetic!!

I can’t believe the experience we’ve had! No one cares it was like what ever you already paid too bad!<//Review>

<review>While Sizzler isn't high-end, it is a long time destination for people looking for a family restaurant serving a decent steak with other options like seafood and salads. This restaurant is clean with good seating and views. Staff is friendly and servers are good about checking up on patrons' needs. The food itself is typical Sizzler..it's fine. Prices are moderate.<//review>< pics>

Still haven't opened the salad bar (for obvious reasons) but hopefully soon enough.< /review>< username>

<text>The best thing about our visit on Mother's day was it was not crowded.  After eating the food I understand why. Our food was cold including the soup.  Our streak were way over cooked and dry and tuff. We didn't send them back for fear of an extra unwanted ingredient might be added. I was just happy to be out the house inside a restaurant.</text></record></dataset><record>

The food is reasonable for the price, although the clam chowder soup was too salty for my liking. The place is decently clean.<//review>

Very basic visit appeal. I guess because of the Covid Protocols, for instance they still aren't allowing salad buffets. You have to order first and they will make it for you. They didn't even put on the TV's while we were there but the waiter service was ok.</review>

Due to covid-19 in full effect The Sizzler is taking all precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. Outside seating was kind of romantic with my loved one. Service was great & our server was very attentive
Most importantly she was nice wit a beautiful personality. Food was hot & delicious
I really enjoyed my date @ Sizzle<//Text>

Overall, the portions were a healthy size for the price, and the food was fresh and flavorful.  My only real complaint was that I could have used more bread, especially with the tomato stew, which was screaming for bread.  On balance though, the place was well priced for great food, and the portions were good size, and the food was almost all uniformly excellent.< /review>

Ordered the Steak & Grilled Shrimp Skewer medium rare

From left to right the streak went from well done to rare..it was all bad, not to mention my brother bit into his hamburger to find a piece of hair.

Also missing fries and clam chowder

Never eating here again<//review>

Can't go wrong with all-you-can-eat salad bar very filling with all the extras they have chicken wings, macaroni and cheese, tacos, nachos, chicken fajitas, soups and fruits... Don't forget to ice cream with all the toppings you want... And all staff members are very nice and helpful.  👍👌< /Text>

<review>Nothing brings me more hate from my closest friends and family than my love for Sizzler. I had a long lunch break and was able to come here for lunch and it was absolutely amazing! Take your time with the friendly server, cheese bread, unlimited salad bar, steak and veggies, and soft serve ice cream with toppings. Sizzler really is a "get what you pay for" type of place so if you are expecting something amazing, look elsewhere. But if you're patient and can vibe with the ambiance it's a really beautiful reprieve.< /review>< Pics>

Sizzler had dine in. They practiced social distancing. Very clean, sanitary. Waitress had mask for mouth eyes & gloves. & buffet  items were served  to the table straight  from the kitchen. Angela was very knowledgeable & professional and made me feel at ease after I haven't been in a sit in Restaurant in 3 month.<//Review>

The service was impeccable the cashier helped me order a better deal, the 6 jumbo shrimps outside layer light crispy while the shrimp was juicy, clam chowder was so good with the cheese toast they give oh & the new fruit juice was just right with my meal. I will be back tomorrow for lunch because the food was good & the service was fast & they were very careful because of the coronavirus i really appreciate that...<//Text>

I haven't been to a Sizzler in a while but they've really stoop low in terms of the portions they give you nowadays. I hope it's just this Sizzler in particular the one by the LAX airport , but I don't see Sizzlers making more money if they literally only give you two items for $15.</Review>

Each location is different.  The Culver City location gives you the soup and salad dishes, but lets you pour your own soda.  The Inglewood location pours your soda, but lets you grab your own dishes.< /Text>

Very high priced menu. Even the salad bar is basically 13$, nothing special just the ordinary. We came here at a last minute decision because someone closed down Hometown, Wonder who did that!? Anyways the service is cool. The guy who brought out the food was super duper nice, he should get a raise.  The food is alright. Don't get the shrimps (not very tasty). Overall it was a good experience. Being my first time here I did expect more, in the end I'm just thankful to have the opportunity to be able to pay for this experience. There is a lot of people who can't.< /text>

A little confusing if you've never visited.  The young lady taking our order tartly asked if we knew what we wanted. Of course,  we had no idea how the ordering system worked.  I told her that I had looked over the menu and,  unless the edge of my steak would be expertly decorated in gold leaf, I think I'll just order water. Post disarmament, she laughed and was delightfully helpful =)
Truthfully, the price was very reasonable considering we fed a family of 6...in California...for $120.
The steaks were impressive - juicy and cooked perfectly. The salad bar was fresh and more than adequate to complete a good steak dinner.
I don't think I could have asked for better. It was a last minute restaurant trip, and just a mile or so from LAX! We'll definitely return when we visit Cali again next year.</Text>

Best steaks for the price and boy you can just add a lobster tail for a few bucks 👌

It was my first time there, it looks like they used to have a salad bar, but now they bring you a mixed house salad 🥗< /Text>

The cashier was patient when taking my order. The salad bar was clean and stocked with some really tasty seasonal items. The server was pleasant, attentive, and he remembered to bring back what I requested. My order came out before I could finish my salad. My steak was just how I asked for it. The peach lemonade was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and my experience.  Will definitely be back. Loved the garlic mash! A really nice option when you don't feel like mixing your baked potato!😊<//Text>

< review>
Ordered the steak (medium) and grilled shrimp combo. Was considering adding the salad bar or even getting just that, but the salad bar wasn’t super impressive - a few types of lettuce and some salad toppings, fried chicken, spaghetti and meatballs, and a few flavors of jello and banana pudding for dessert.

The shrimp wasn’t cleaned very well and there were several chunks of shell on the main part of the shrimp that I had to peel off. The rice was so soaked in lemon that it was inedible.

I ordered my steak medium, and the first time it came out rare. When I got our server’s attention I sent it back. It went back on the grill (after going onto the table and being cut into - MAJOR health code violation) and around 5-7 minutes later came out very well done. I sent it back a second time and they sent out a new steak. Cooked just as rare as the first one.

The cashier, server, and manager were very nice and credited the difference between the shrimp skewers and the steak and shrimp combo, but that’s the only reason I feel this review even deserves a one star instead of the ‘I’m only giving one star because I can’t give zero’ ratings. I hadn’t been to a Sizzlers in many years and we only went because it was close to our hotel at LAX, and based on this visit I would have a hard time recommending it to others.</review>

Always clean, can get crowded(especially for holidays). Salad bar is what I usually get, my favorite are the chicken wings, and sometimes they have Pozole in the soup section. If you want great service and are there during the day, ask if Tony is working and sit in his section. His service is always great, and will make you feel right at home.<//review>

<rating>3< /rating><review>Great tasting food. Portion sizes are way off. Salad and ice cream bar are a great side order if you have kids. The wife and I enjoyed it but my portion size was way off from my wife I got the Chicken Malibu with mash potatoes for $13.99 and the wife got the baby back ribs with bbq chicken 14.99 and a salad bar 6.99. What a surprise when our meals came and my steak was 1” wide by about 10 inches long, the chicken malibu was a piece of breaded chick puck with a slice of ham and cheese, the mashed potatoes were the best part in a separate dish on the plate with salted melted butter. My wife’s 3 ribs were large and covered in bbq sauce her chicken was a actual breast char broiled I believe with a healthy helping of bbq sauce. Her baked potatoes was perfectly cooked and pressed open with there butter sauce added to it. She also had the salad bar which for her was great because it had a sea food salad in it which she loves. All together I was impressed with here’s and left hungry with mine.

<Review>Sizzler the ultimate fast food killer. I love sizzler.
All fast food prices went up. So before you think about mc d's,  burger king or others go check out Sizzles. I had tri tip steak and a bake potatoes for 12.95. If you were at fast food places it would cost $10.00.  It makes good sense to spend $2.00 more.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
There were changes after my year-long absence. It cost me at least $ 30 (including sales tax) for the complete meal (normally around the $ 20 range last time), including the vastly reduced salad bar (missing out some of my favorite ingredients. Some of the furnishings have high top tables, one which I took & didn't mind. There were a few customers as I observed unlike before.<//Review>

So glad they are back. This is one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Oakland. The food is delicious and always consistent. My favorites are the scallops, salmon, and the shrimp corn cakes are a great option that blends together so well. Don't leave without trying the chocolate souffle or the Panna Cotta.</Text>

This is your classic Sizzler, my nephew always gets the giant cheeseburger and fries and he loves it. Salad bar is kept fresh, we went for lunch typical busy mix of local businesses taking their lunch break and some neighborhood regulars enjoying a meal in the air conditioning, nice clean bathrooms. The crew was very friendly and helpful, nice and fast get you in sitting down and eating in just a few minutes. Only rub is parking is pretty tight, they have a valet there to help but could be a problem at lunch time.< /Review>

Don't leave without trying the chocolate souffle or the Panna Cotta.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

The food was really good, like what I expect from the brand. The hostess was very friendly and helpful. The waitress, however, didn't remember I was there, I think, because it took a long time to come by my table and once she did, seems to have forgotten that I ordered a drink. She wasn't terrible. She was nice enough and smiled a lot, just wasn't very attentive.< /review>

<text>This is the most community driven Sizzler I've ever been to. Suuuuper chill. Secret: do NOT order a loaded backed potato. That's $5. Order a regular baked potato for $2.50 then get all the fixings at the salad bar which you undoubtedly got cause you're dining at Sizzler.<//text><user_name>Andrew Devine< /user_name>< rate>

<Review>Bait & Switch.
Went in for the $6.99 lunch deal they have posted outside which was a burger or chicken plate or salad bar.
I asked for the salad bar which came out to $9.99.
I asked for the lunch special. Cashier said there is a $6.99 salad bar and $ 9.99 salad bar.
I said, ok, I would like the $6.99 salad bar.

Cashier said, we don't have a $6.99 salad bar. Only a $9.99 salad bar.

How does that make sense to anyone in charge?

Last time I go to that shady place.<//Review>< pics>

Decent restaurant. Got salmon and fries, with a bowl for salad bar. Fried chicken from bar is very salty, skin is bordering on rock-hard. Chicken has no flavor. Pasta cooked well past al dente, and sauce is flavorless. Salmon skin still has shards of scales on it, and table is not cleaned well. Would not come back.</text>

No other restaurant can get as simple as sizzlers, a family style of coarse. I asked a simple question about a simple sauce on the burger which the employee answered "uhh I don't know burger sauce". I didn't ask to be complicated I asked because I have an allergy and it acts like this that make me rethink about me eating here again.<//Text>

No other restaurant can get as simple as sizzlers, a family style of coarse. I asked a simple question about a simple sauce on the burger which the employee answered "uhh I don't know burger sauce". I didn't ask to be complicated I asked because I have an allergy and it acts like this that make me rethink about me eating here again.</review>

I was there 4/30/19. Around 3 it was pretty slow parking lot is decent sized. We ordered steak & shrimp skewers, n upgraded to the bigger steak the shrimp was lil salty, I got also got the strawberry lemonade which pretty good just the right amount of sugar. Steak was decent size n very flavorful waitress was on point n attentive .I gave 4 stars cuz of the salty shrimp,  nice clean place will go back soon.

The only site that I have found in USA where you can eat like in Italy.
Light Soup, varied salads and meat.
The best is that everythings is served plain (or buffet) where you can add after a sauce ... if you want.</Text>

<Review>After standing in line for 20 minutes, my family and I sat down and the table was sticky. We had to wait for 15 minutes more to see our waitress who only said two words to us and didn't even ask if we needed anything. Our drinks were never refilled the whole time we were there and the salad bar was stocked with food that was sitting on a cart in front of the bar. I ordered beef tips which was the "manager special" and let me tell you there was NOTHING special about this crappy food. I ordered mine medium and it came out BURNT! I would suggest going somewhere else!!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< rating>

< review>
The quality of meat here has gone down a lot.

I ordered sirloin tips today for lunch.

Presentation was nice, two skewers loaded with meat, resting on a bed of rice. However after removing the wooden skewers there were at least half of the morsels of meat that consisted almost completely of gristle while the remaining pieces also were difficult to eat with slightly less strips of gristle and fat.

I brought this quietly to the attention of my server and she said everyone complains about it.

Is it just me or is something missing?

I saw a new feature upon arriving at the restaurant today, free valet parking! I did self park but am thinking money is being spent here in the wrong places by management.< /review>

Food was okay service sucked( or should I say what service)   had to ask a busboy to get something for me in order to get the service person over and then service person wanted to clean the table while I'm eating (which would have been fine if she had cleaned the table 10 minutes earlier).< /text>

This was our first meal in the US the service was good but quite confusing when you walk in it since you have no idea if you should go left or right. The manager and staff is incredibly friendly.</text>

Worst sizzler ever. It should close down it's that bad. The staff are extremely rude, the food was stale or soggy and there was a grease smell that came from the kitchen. Outside there are homeless people, stray cats and cockroaches. I was completely shocked at the poor condition of what I remember being a great restaurant.< /review>

Terrible dining experience on Friday evening April 17, 2015.  My Italian grilled chicken breast was very small and like eating shoe leather.  I asked for a refill on my iced tea a total of 3 times and never got a refill even though I was assured one was coming each time.   I finally just left.< /Review>

<review>I was under the impression that Sizzler had gone bankrupt in '89 and closed up shop everywhere soon after...until I moved back to CA and tasted truth for the first time in twenty years.

The ribs were dripping off the bone and melting in my mouth inbetween endless trips back and forth from the salad bar of wonder centerpieceing the restaurant.  The folks at Sizzler don't mind if you're feeding a party of three with only one 'AYCE'  salad bar purchase so don't feel bad that they do when you do.  This is Inglewood, right up the street from 'Randy's Doughnuts'  and 'Roscoes Chicken and Waffles' ; do you really think they care about how much salad you walk away with.

I couldn’t think of one thing I could complain about past myself for mearly having a thought in my head that there would be anything about Sizzler that I  could possibly want to complain about.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>I was under the impression that Sizzler had gone bankrupt in '89 and closed up shop everywhere soon after...until I moved back to CA and tasted truth for the first time in twenty years.

The ribs were dripping off the bone and melting in my mouth inbetween endless trips back and forth from the salad bar of wonder centerpieceing the restaurant.  The folks at Sizzler don't mind if you're feeding a party of three with only one 'AYCE'  salad bar purchase so don't feel bad that they do when you do.  This is Inglewood, right up the street from 'Randy's Doughnuts'  and 'Roscoes Chicken and Waffles' ; do you really think they care about how much salad you walk away with.

I couldn’t think of one thing I could complain about past myself for mearly having a thought in my head that there would be anything about Sizzler that I  could possibly want to complain about.< /Text>< name>

Have been there several times, but the food now seems to be bland, no favor, the salad dressings are watered down.  This place has changed over the years. Could it be because the neighborhood has changed?!</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) American-style steak is simple but delicious! It was good because there was a salad bar and I could not get vegetables in the US. Cheese toast (with garlic?) Is good! I think that it is cheaper than Japan and good for families.
