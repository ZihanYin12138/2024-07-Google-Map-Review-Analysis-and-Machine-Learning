I’d have given this pharmacy 5 stars just one month ago. I’ve been coming here for years.

The pharmacy technicians here are all quite helpful and kind. Some will go out of their way to help you, should any issue with filling your medication arise. Most of the pharmacists are also quite kind and helpful. However, there are a few new (?) pharmacists who are frankly dangerous. They might try and override your doctor’s orders and might even try and stop your medication suddenly. One that can cause seizures and death if stopped in such a manner. Both of these things happened to me at Otay Mesa.

It’s taken me two weeks to try and get a prescription I’ve been on for over 10 years filled and it’s still not ready yet. They are punishing the patient for lack of communication among their own staff. This has severely aggravated one of the exact conditions the medication was prescribed to treat. I am scared to go back to this location as it is retraumatizing each time. I will likely be driving 20+ minutes to the next closest location, even though I live approx 1 mile from this one.</Review>

<Text>I have been with Kaiser for over there years now. This is the first time I’ve experienced or even heard of this: the doctor, Dr. Diaz himself decided to cancel my 1 month old son’s appointment. I understand it’s not emergent, but to not even address the parent’s concern at all by totally cancelling our appointment? It’s unprofessional and unforgivable.< /Text><gmapID>0x80d94ed7bee2bd6b:0x906a508caddaa54c<//gmapID></record>

<Text>My exp. This past year has been that Kaiser is using Covid to slow or even deny services to it's members something that Kaiser is infamous for and gets sued freq
Over the past year I have found frontline people at Kaiser like the people who answer phones make appt or greet you at the entrance a absolutely obnoxious and rude. I get the impression that they feel protected insulated from the paying members because of Covid restriction. You can't walk into a managers office before and complain!. And when you ask for the manager or the admin in charge they hang up on you.
That is why I file a complaint with the HMO regulators in CA every week</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This company is a JOKE! Your response to my review is also a joke that link does not hellp at all. Just today I had a phone appointment for a serious health condition, waited by my phone and they never called. They just cancelled the appointment.  I had to call in and wait 25 minutes to find out what happened, I was told my doctor claimed they called three times and it was busy which is a lie. If so why didn't they email me or contact me through the app like before?  When I called in to find out what happened they could do NOTHING they were so full they couldn't even give me another appointment. Avoid this scam company, I'm getting out as fast as I can!< /review>

Had a trip and fall while running.  Cuts and abrasions.  So I went in the next day, Presiden'ts Day, to Urgent Care to get properly dressed and a tetenus shot.  I arrived at approx 5:55 pm.  I was checked in by service rep Candy Cuevas.  (Nice alliteration.)  She then directed me to take a seat.  So I'm sitting there waiting.  At around 6:35 pm a male staff member comes over to me:  "We have cameras and we've been watching you," creepy, I thought.  "You're supposed to go to the other window."
Well this was  my first time at Urgent Care in about five years, so excuse me if I didn't know.  I told him that the service rep, Cuevas, did NOT say anything to me about that.  He replied with an express apology then changed the topic to checking in to a second window to get my ID bracelet.  I told that lady to let them know what had happened which caused me to be waiting there for a little over a half hour.  She said she would but I don't think it helped any because by the time  I got out it was  past 8:00pm!!!  The young lady at the second window said "I apologize for the confusion."  There was no confusion.  Candy Cuevas simply did not tell me I had to go to the other window next.  Now, sure anyone can make a mistake, but when the staff member who was "watching me" came over to me, another patient rose to his feet and complained that HE TOO had NOT been told anything by Candy Cuevas and he had been there waiting for a whole hour!!!  So, obviuosly, she was NOT informing patients as she should have, creating a backlog in the process.  Further, she had no "training" on her badge so she could not have been new.  These positions in representative services are very coveted positions.  And if some people are unable to do their job right or take it for granted, they really should not be there.< /Text>

<Date>1538515577676</Date><rating>4< /rating><text>All of Bonita and Otay Medical Staff have been great. And the doctors in Urgent Care are awesome. Such friendly caring doctors. Compared to other insurances I have had. Kaiser tops them all.
Dr Aguilera has been my primary since I rejoined years back is the BEST doctor ever. I just love her caring concerns and emails me back fast every time I’ve emailed her.
The Garfield surgical doctors are good. But I have issues with their expertise. I feel they need more time to better the as far as surgery concerns. I haven’t been very happy so far.
And the emergency room Doctors  on Zion  haven’t met  the list at all of a great rating. It may be due to the fact there is only one hospital in this area for Kaiser. I sure hope that it is remedied soon. Because the value system is jeopardized on ratings from the crowded emergency  room area. The amount of patients compared to the doctors combined with the low amount of rooms they have. I really think they need another hospital facility. Either in South Bay , Otay or east county. I think it would greatly  improve how doctors treat the patients at extreme times. I give them a four  over all. When this improves my rating will rating will go up too.
I hope that we can look forward to seeing improvements in the near future.<//text>< Pictures>

My first time. I called customer service the day before to ask for appointment.for urgent care. She said I can just walk in but she never said wait time 1.5 - 2 hrs. Front desk said it has always been the practice of Kaiser. They don't even triage? I have flu symptoms.  This is first time to have to wait this long. I tried to call customer service again to see if I could use my card with a different facility but it's been almost an hour and no one picks up. I. Nauseated and dizzy. I wish I could change my plan. I thought it's go nood because it has Kaiser name. Now I know it's not really how I heard it. I will call benefits dept if they could change or just cancel. Good luck with that for me. I know when October comes, I will definitely change.
I am editing this review. The one star was for a first timer. But there is such a thing as.excellent customer service recovery which they far compensated for the initial disappointment. I was wondering about The smiles and complacency of patients at the waiting room at the time until I found out once  inside how excellent and  and warm nurses and doctors are far above any other facilities that I have experience. It's also  sa great service all in one stop shop:urgent,l primary, lab, pharmacy. I am glad I did choose Kaiser health insurance.<//Text>

<Text>Kaiser has been the worst medical insurance ever . There providers call out sick constantly making me have to wait yet another month for an appointment. This is just my experience with orthopedic department . My daughter has physical therapy and 3 times they called me the morning of the appointment to tell me the therapist called out sick . Mind you these are different therapist that she would get scheduled with . 3 times in a row cancelled and cancelled .

First experience was awesome at the worker comp office of Dr. FERAR (with an appointment but had to wait 3 weeks). The Dr. made a referral and told me to come back if they don't call after 2 weeks to get an extension for time off work. He said to just drive here on the 2nd (2 weeks from office visit date) and the desk will print the extension letter and we'll send you on your way. The Dr. made it clear to me that this is an easy process, and now I've been waiting 1.5 hrs to get a stupid letter printed to extend my time off work. They would not expedite me to get the stupid letter printed, I had to wait as a walk in as if I was there for a regular Dr. visit. Dr. Ferar needs to learn that it isn't as simple as he made it seem and to better inform his patients of the process. I am now late to another appointment due to the misleading info.</Text>

<review>Always saying  Medicine not ready/Dr not sent order / it's not in the system/ we dont control what Dr order/ still waiting for ?. This  Pharmacy is getting worse by the Minute , they make you  feel  like  they are doing you a favor. Theirs no accountability , No responsible personal in charge . They dont have a clue that the  Medicine we need is for patients like us to feel better and live a healthier life. Can't wait to find a different pharmacy to  get our prescription. Very disappointed and frustrating at this location. Problaby won't matter what this one customer is saying.</review>< Gmap_id>

I rushed through traffic to get there.  When I arrived two ladies act like I was inconveniencing them by showing up.  I guess they get tired from sitting down all day.  Maybe they can invest in some customer service training or buy them a couple of gym memberships.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Staff is nice and the facility is modern, but, it's too far to drive for urgent care and this is only one of two places where they have urgent care now. That's not the fault of this facility, but if you have to go to urgent care, you'll be driving here.<//Text>

< Review>
I went there to get an ingrown toenail removed and the doctor that could “supposedly remove it” stated that it was my fault that it happened to me. I agreed because it WAS my fault and he proceeded to give me mupirocin ointment. But the fact that he called me out and didn’t help, I still have an ingown nail and the ointment DOESNT HELP. The only reason I’m giving a 2 star is because they helped my mother with a lot.< /Review>

<text>Terrible experience so far.  We took our son to get a physical done and his shots to start school. Keep in mind that my son is 4, and the Doctor was supposed to order blood test, which he forgot to do. The doctor seem like he was new, which usually I don't mind, but when we kept asking questions, he looked confused, and often times responded with an " I don't know" . When I got to the lab the next day, they drew blood, but like I said the order was not complete. They drew blood on my son for the partial order, and the next day they had a hard time finding that he had any blood work done. According to them there was no blood work drawn. After they found it, they told me that it wasn't complete and that I needed to bring my son for another blood draw. I couldn't understand the accent of the lady on the phone, but she just kept saying "it's ok, it's ok, we just need to draw blood again". It's hard for your patients to take days off, and I really hate to hear "it's ok" like its no big deal. Now I have to go again for this incompetence, and it is not ok. Besides, how easy do you think it is to draw blood on a 4 year old?<//text>< Gmap_id>

<text>The new front desk girls are rude and don't know anything. I'm disappointed in whoever hired these snobs. They misinformed me so my insurance is still pending for my 6 month old. Luckily someone  in claims is doing their job right by correcting this mishap but why should it come to this in the first place. Jesus take the wheel cause these new girls give attitude and don't know Jack. Very upset by this only because I wouldn't want my baby to have an emergency while my insurance is pending. 👎👎👎 Kaiser, you let me down.< /text>< pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Don't go to this hospital !! It is the worst option. In March my wife had our third baby and all prenatal appointments were here. From the beginning we realized how careless the nurses were, but for insurance reasons we stayed. We decided not to have any more children and asked for the form for the tubal ligation procedure. They did not have the Spanish form and although my wife understands the language and I know English perfectly, they told us that we had a translator. Nurse Rocío was given the task of translating and signing the form. Total months passed and we realized that they never gave us the form and we went for it a few days before the delivery. On the day of delivery, they tell us that the form of the procedure does not have the signature of Nurse Rocío and the operation was not performed despite having given our authorization long before. Then as a second option at the permanent Kaiser Hospital on Mission Rd. My wife had the IUD installed. My wife commented that the nurse who attended her that day struggled a lot in the facility, she placed one, checked and realized that it was incorrectly placed and at that moment she took it out to place another, when the nurse rechecked she comments: " much better ", which obviously did not convince my wife. As the month went by, and after so many desections and doubting that the device was correctly placed, we went to another doctor to make sure that the IUD was inserted correctly and after checking with ultrasound he told us that it was NOT in the right place, so That was a risk, even the device threads were too short. We are now using methods that don't really make us feel totally safe because of all the carelessness and incompetence of the Kaiser hospital staff. Don't go to Kaiser for your own good ...

No vayan a este hospital!! Es la peor opción. En Marzo tuvo mi esposa nuestro tercer bebé y todas las citas prenatales fueron aquí. Desde un inicio nos dimos cuenta de lo descuidadas que eran las enfermeras pero por motivos de aseguranza nos quedamos. Decidimos no tener más hijos y pedimos la forma para el procedimiento de la operación de ligacion de trompas. No tenían la forma en español y aunque mi esposa entiende el idioma y yo sé el inglés a la perfección nos dijeron que ocupabamos traductor. A la enfermera Rocío se le fue Dada la tarea de traducción y de firmar la forma. Total pasaron los meses y nos dimos cuenta que nunca nos entregaron la forma y fuimos por ella unos días antes del parto. El día del parto nos avisan que la forma del procedimiento no tiene la firma de la enfermera Rocío y no se hizo la operación a pesar de haber dado con mucho tiempo antes nuestra autorización. Después como segunda opción en el hospital Kaiser permanente de Mission Rd. le instalaron a mi esposa el DIU. Mi esposa comento que la enfermera que la atendió ese dia  batallo mucho en la instalación, le colocó uno, revisó y se dió cuenta que estaba colocado incorrectamente y en ese momento se lo extrajo para colocar otro, al volver a revisar la enfermera comenta: "much better", lo que obviamente no dejó convencida a mi esposa. Pasando el mes, y después de tantas desepciones  y la duda de que el dispositivo estuviera bien colocado acudimos a otro doctor para asegurarnos de que el DIU estuviera puesto correctamente y después de revisar con ultrasonido nos dijo que NO estaba en el lugar adecuado, por lo que era un riesgo,  incluso los hilos del dispositivo eran demasiado cortos. Ahora estamos usando métodos que realmente no nos hacen sentir seguros totalmente por causa de todos los descuidos e incompetencia del personal del hospital Kaiser. No vayan a Kaiser por su propio bien...</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

(Translated by Google) Very poor service they give both on calls and when you go to doctor's appointments, if you get lucky and they give you an appointment. Now I understand x that quite a few people move to another place. They tell you to be 15 minutes early but it is useless because other people pass by anyway who arrive after your appointment.

(Original)
Muy mal servicio el que dan tanto en llamadas como cuando vas alas citas del doctor ,si es que te toca suerte y te den una cita. ahora entiendo el x que bastantes personas se mueven a otro lugar. Te dicen que estes 15 minutos antes pero de nada sirve porque de todos modos pasan otras personas que llegan después de tu cita.< /review>

Pool table, shuffle board, watch tv, free coffee, etc. super clean shop. Don’t risk going to a dealer or mechanic who doesn’t do tires regularly. They’ll make mistakes....8 Ball won’t. They do this all day long. Trevor and 8 Ball tires are honest and do great work.

Matches internet prices, low prices on labor. Excellent selection. They can order any tire and ship next day if not in stock. They also do breaks if needed. Balance with beads or weights. Comfy seats and drinks while you wait. Pool table and shuffle board to play while you wait also.</Text>

The Guys at 8 Ball are Amazing!!!!
I've always had them handle my tire needs but this time I really needed their help. I just got a 2012 Harley Ultra Limited and noticed that there was a strange pulse from the front brakes. The Guys at 8 Ball figured out that there was a slight warp in the rotors and replaced them along with the pads and now it stops Butter Smooth!!!!! Thanks to the Guys at 8 Ball I'm ready to take this bike cross country!!!!

Thanks Again for the Great Work!!!!!

By far the best price on tires!  Trevor was super helpful and when I called back to book the appointment, he remembered all my details from our first conversation when he quoted me. Saved me time , which I appreciate. Professional, knowledgeable, and courteous and when I came in, he made me feel welcomed...I hate to say - not always the case at motorcycle shops. Thanks Trevor, I’ll be back and spreading the word on your killer vibe there!< /Text>

<Review>Honest, reliable, and timely.

Don't even  bother considering going anywhere else to get your tires. Competitive pricing, and effective appointment system make the experience a great one into any looking to get some help. In addition, the waiting area is comfy with complimentary helmet shelves, cold water, and even coffee machine.

I got some American Elite 4's for my 2006 FXDL that was recommended by them, along with a rebate promo they had going on for the tires. I had some other choices in mind for tires, but they provided excellent customer service give me a bigger picture as to what I would eventually end up getting.

Ask for Trevor! The man knows his tires and will always do you a solid for each riders' individuals needs. Thanks again guys!< /Review>< gmap_id>

Trevor and Josh are both great techs and are very knowledgeable. Customer service is beyond superb. Turn around time is usually spot on. Had my bike towed and the flat bed was covered in oil. After repairing my valve stem they made sure to wash off my tires and still warned me to take it easy for a few hundred miles just to be safe. They also price match and will make sure you are taken care of. I'll keep coming back. P.s. bike night elevery last Wednesday of the month.< /text>

I have never had a better tire changing experience in my life. First of all the shop is clean and spacious, well lit and welcoming. I had an appointment made and my bike was taken exactly on time.

They have a pool table and shuffleboard table in showroom, I got to talking to another customer and we played pool while we waited for our bikes to get worked on. It couldn't have taken more than an hour.

Pricing was fair and they even spotted and corrected a small assembly error from the dealership I bought the bike from.

I was referred here by a friend of mine, and I'll be referring anyone who asks me to these guys too.

To top it off, the other customer and myself got on our newly shoed bikes and went on a ride!< /text>

Received a flat tire and was stranded. Called around to towing companies and they said that they would be  able to come get me in an hour. I decided to call 8 ball for advice on a faster towing company. Talked to the owner and he was able to come get me at no charge! I was so relieved! Great printing on replacement tire. This will now be my place for all my bike tires!</review>

Called in for a new front tire. Spoke with Trevor, and despite being as busy as they were, he was able to squeeze me in. They had the best selection and he was able to provide a great recommendation for my style riding.

Prices were incredibly competitive. Trevor and Josh took great care of me. I would not go anywhere else.

Absolutely the best place to get tires! The customer service is exceptional and you can’t beat their prices! I had a flat on my bike yesterday and they got me in and replaced the tire extremely fast. Not to mention the waiting area is the best I’ve seen and been in. If you’re looking for a place to buy motorcycle tires, I highly suggest going here!!!< /Text>

<Review>Excellent young man that owns this shop, super knowledgeable about his product,  killer prices, beyond excellent customer service. Shop was spotless both inside the showroom and in the work area.  Had my softail classic on and off the lift in a short time and installed not the tire I asked for but suggested a better (commander III) instead. Cant say enough positive comments about my new tire guy in san Diego< /Review>< Time>

Great service and detail. Thanks Steve. I gained better insight on tire service and maintenance because of Steve. He not only wiped down the front wheel and the tire I bought, but he wiped down the rear as well to give me a starting point to watch the area. I have about one year left on the rear tire and will be back when it's time.  Thanks guys! (Steve & Trevor)</Review>

<Review>Staff was super helpful when I was going back and forth on tires for my FZ-07. There selection was really strong, so I had more options than I expected which actually felt overwhelming at first, but their knowledge of each and every model made it super simple.

I booked an appointment on their website , received a confirmation text describing the process and when I arrived they had already set aside the factory spec’d tires for my bike.

The whole process took about an hour, but the wait went by fast as I played a few rounds of pool, enjoyed a nice cup of coffee and even played shuffleboard.

I’ll definitely be returning.<//Review><rate>5<//rate>< pictures>

Story time! So I got my bike out of storage earlier this week after it had been sitting for a couple years and took it the place I purchased it to get it refreshed including new tires. Got the bike home last night and when I went to ride it this morning, there's a screw in the tire. Call the shop and they say the best they can do is 10% off a new tire.. so I get to buy a new tire after I just got one and rode 10 miles on it. Now that that parts out of the way...

What can I say about 8 ball tires.. these guys are the best! Honest and knowledgeable and even pointed out a few things that were overlooked. They recommended a new shop for me to take the bike to. I will be following their advice! You owe it to yourself to give them your business! I hope to do more business with you guys in the future you make everything smooth! They had my bike in and out in less then 30 mins. Thank  you again<//Text>

Exceptional service and products. I rode in with a nail in my back tire and totally forgot that I had purchased a tire replacement warrantee with that tire. They promptly notified that the new tire would be provided for free. Needless to say I was very impressed. Since I also needed a front tire, both were installed while I waited. I have never received this level of professional tire service in my 55 years of riding. My only regret is that I didn’t find out about 8 Ball sooner.<//text>

8 Ball Motorcycle Tires was a great place to get tires.  Staff was friendly and courteous.  Trevor was knowledge and gave good recommendations for tire selection without shoving down your throat.   He setup appointment and sent out reminder via text.  Steve was the tech who did the service for set of tires.  Service was quick and location easy to get to.  Traffic was a little thick around 5pm but that is to be expected.  While waiting coffee and water available and good seating area along with place to put gear.   Overall very pleased and future business is 💯.</review>

<Text>My experience with 8 Ball Escondido has been over the top. First, I had a great experience getting my new rear tire in 2018. Then again, over 1 year later I realized there was a problem with the exhaust due to the way the axle bolt was re-installed. After talking with Trevor about it and sending some pics, he immediately ensured me that they would take responsibility and had my bike towed to the shop where they fixed everything up the same day. I'm amazed at the awesome customer service here, it's not very often you come across a great owner like, Trevor! I will definitely be getting my tires from here in the future and highly recommend 8 Ball Escondido.</Text>< UserId.>

<Text>Very kind staff. I got a new set of tires for my 883 they have great prices and are very helpful. It was all done in a timely manner and very pleased with the overall experience. While waiting I was offered a drink and also watched them help other customers and making sure everyone’s needs have been met. Very great place and will always recommend to anyone that needs new motorcycle tires!</Text>< pics>

Recently had a front tire replaced at 8ball Escondido. Both the service tech and owner were awesome. I'm a new rider and they took the time to show me some good beginner routes around San Diego, were very personable and most importantly, the tire feels great. I will definitely be coming here for all of my future needs and would recommend them with confidence.</review>

<Review>Great customer service.

But then I hit a pothole out of town. That's where the nightmare begins. They cross threaded a few of the nuts and lost one from the rear wheel, they didn't tighten down my muffler and failed to replace one of those bolts, and their road hazard warranty is completely useless if anything happens to you out of town, so don't buy it if you ever plan on riding outside of San Diego county.

Edit: this place really knows how to make an unhappy customer happy. I don't think I've ever seen a company in California work this hard to make things right. Thanks Trevor!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>After a month of riding and some hard miles on new rubber, I'd like to thank 8 Ball and Trevor for hooking me up with some sweet tires for my DRZ. Trevor walked me through the options, explained them thoroughly, and made a solid recommendation that's totally changed my ride. 8 Ball was quick and reasonable, and communicated extremely well through the ordering and installation.

<text>Never met a Trevor I didn't like. That goes for 8 Ball Motorcycles Trevor as well.  He, along with Steven are both incredibly helpful, provide super fast service,  are incredibly friendly and there to help. Way better (and more reasonable) than going through a dealer, handily beating any other quote I was able to get for new KLR tires. If you need your tires swapped, there's no better place to get it done. Will definitely be back! Thanks guys< /text>< gmapID>

If you guys are second guessing about going here, DON'T. These guys really know what they are doing and are crazy knowledgeable about every motorcycle tire on the market.

Pro service, big confidence in Steven and Trevor..
I needed tires, I knew that....but where to go. I remembered the supportive team some months back for SemperRide on base at Camp Pendleton. So I called today, got immediate help, Steven pinned down what I needed and checked inventory. I rode directly to 8 Ball Motorcycle Tires, Escondido. This was my 1st time in the shop, I noticed how spacious and relaxed it is. Trevor got me matched up with tires, no surprises... I was back on my bike in no time. Cool shop, no pressure, good vibes and No Judgement! Thx -Celeste<//text>

< review>
I tried 8 Ball for the first time.   I usually see the dealership to replace tires, and it often takes a week to coordinate,  and possibly in the shop a day.

I called Trevor at 8 Ball in Escondido, and he used his obvious knowledge to help me choose the right tires.  Then the shipping company messed up the delivery,  and Trevor called me immediately to let me know.  No surprises.  When the tires were delivered,  again,  a prompt phone call from Trevor letting me know.

Steven the mechanic not only changed my tires in just under 2 hours, he took the time to point out some future maintenance concerns specific to my motorcycle.

All in all, I will definitely be using 8 Ball again.<//review>

8ball tires in amazing I got the American Dunlop elites a great price and the protectoin plan was worth it as 1 month later I struck a nail. These guys replaced it for no charge and even welcomed me by my first names as I walked in. Could not recommend these guys enough!</review>

I had two suits and one suit jacked cleaned here. Had to take the time to give these guys a review because I had a great experience. Great service. Fast too. Asked me when I wanted it done by, love that! Did a great job. Fixed any buttons or hems that needed repair. 5/5 for these guys.<//Review>

< Review>
I am a professional Santa Claus with a very expensive suit. I will only trust Bud's Dry Cleaners in Roseville to clean it. No worry about color run in to the fur as I had at another place. They are professional, get the items out timely and fun to deal with THANKS, Cindy and staff at Bud's.</Review>

<text>Do NOT bring your wedding dress here!! Or anything for that matter. I brought my wedding dress here to be dry cleaned as I have a tradition where for my anniversary I wear it, and was looking forward to wearing it for my 2 year anniversary. I dropped off the dress and was told it would only take 2-3 days to be cleaned. A week went by and I got no call about it. Come my anniversary day there still wasn’t a call so I came by to inquire about it and it still wasn’t ready. Worst part is the lady who was helping me admitted that it had been snagged by someone there but quickly said they could steam it out. She said all this very nonchalantly and didn’t even apologize for the snag, I mean come on no one wants to hear someone messed with their wedding dress like that! They told me to take the dress home and bring it back later so they could steam the dress and complete payment. My family was furious when I showed them what had happened to the dress and they recommended I take it to David’s Bridal, where I had bought it, to have them fix it. When I called Buds they told me David’s Bridal wouldn’t be able to fix it; that David’s Bridal didn’t know what they were talking about or doing. I told the lady on the phone I was going to have David’s Bridal fix my dress and she rudely told me “good luck with that” and nonchalantly said not to come in and pay for the cleaning. Of course I wasn’t going to pay for a cleaning- they ruined a part of my wedding dress! The worst part about this experience was just the lack of compassion and taking no responsibility on their end. Also, I had taken the dress in to be cleaned in a stunning David’s Bridal bag and got it returned to me in a cheap see through plastic bag. Horrible experience I would never recommend you come here! I should have listened to the bad reviews about this place. I’m also expecting to get a reply saying that I’m lying (as that looks to be the response people who give bad reviews get) or that I somehow have the wrong place. This is the Buds off of Judah Street in Roseville. Beware of this place! Never coming back.

Update: I added a star to my review as the owner did reach out and apologize, which I appreciate. However, I still would never come back because of the emotional toil this whole situation took on me and how rude the employee was.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1604613450334, 'text': 'Janelle\nI am so very sorry that we failed you  terribly. I am also very sorry for my employees response. She will be reprimanded for that. It is not the way we have been doing business for over 63 years. I am second generation and have owned the business for over 40.\nI want to say I am sorry for the debacle. If there was a snag in the chiffon it can easily be steamed out. I wish you would have reached out to us. I would have taken care of it no problem. We do over 200 wedding gowns a year and have really never had a problem. Snags do happen sometimes. Even when wearing. But it is not ruined. I will gladly fix it or replace that piece of fabric.\nI know that it is very special to you and we treat them that way alway. We just missed this time.\nPlease reach out to me and we will take care of you.\nBtw. The review you were talking about me asking if she had the right place the plastic bag she had in that shot was over 15 years old. We can not use printed plastic bags since the early 2000. I finally talked to her. She had it hanging in the closet for that long. Then took it out and it was dirty.\nNot to make excuses. Just wanted to clarify.\nPleas reach out to me. Again so sorry we messed up.\nCindy Nichols Kitchell.\n916-521-1156.'}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809b203f9c093283:0xa34fa3e6cfe0f9ee<//Gmap_id></record>

The people at Bud’s are the best. This cleaner went above and beyond in helping me when I experienced a flood in my home recently.  The day after the flood I loaded up rugs, towels and linens In garbage bags and they laundered and cleaned everything to perfection.  I then took over 9 decorative sofa pillows that were stained and what I though were not salvageable. I finally moved backed into my home last week and went to pick up the pillows. To my surprise they were on hangers and had been cleaned to perfection.

I will continue to recommend Bud’s to everyone. It’s so unusual anymore to find a business who cares and they definitely care for their customers.<//text>

HORRIBLE PLACE!
Ruined my brand new shirt that cost me $120 and when I got it back I explained to them that they messed up the shirt, and I want it fixed. They lied straight to my face and told me that they don’t know what I am talking about and they didn’t do anything!
it didn’t look like that before I gave it to them, and the shirt was brand new.
Had a bad feeling about something happening so I learned to always take pictures of my garments before I get them dry cleaned, and at the time I even had pictures of it before I gave it to them and tried showing them but they didn’t want to see the pictures.
Horrible place to do business, and to get your dry cleaning done!
They have zero customer service and are liars!!< /text>

< Review>
Just moved to Roseville and needed some uniforms pressed and looking sharp.  Normally I would iron myself but I wanted to see if dry cleaners were worth the money.  Two uniforms were $36!!!  And it took a week.  Ok kinda pricey but when I got the uniforms back they didn't even stand up to my home ironed set.  I asked them about it and apparently the uniform I brought in wont take starch.....what?  Needless to say I had my faith in dry cleaners crushed, until last week I figured I'd give it one more try and took it to the cleaners down the street.  $18 and ready in two days.  Picked them up and was amazed, creases are thoroughly starched and look crisp and sharp.  So I found my favorite new place.  I wouldn't recommend Buds for uniforms but maybe they are great for other things...hopefully.< /Review>

I just finished six months of Invisalign that was easy, fast and pretty painless.  I love the results. I’m now turning 60 and my smile is back, my teeth are straight and looking better than they did pre-diving board.  Why did I wait so long?  You’re never too old to look and feel your best.  I’m glad that I invested in myself in appearance and in recovering something I lost.  Thank you.

<review>Dr. Melko and her staff is great. They are professional, thoughtful and helpful. What separates Dr. Melko from other dentists I have gone to is her transparency and patience. She will take the time to explain the procedures and consequences so one can make an informed decision. I have been going to the same location for over 30 years. During that period, there have been 4 dentists. Dr. Melko is by far the best.</review>< rate>

I needed a thorough dental cleaning and when I visited Melko Dental I was highly impressed by how thorough Dr. Melko is with her examination process and how she takes all the time you need answering questions and concerns. Mercedes, the hygienist did my cleaning and she is very talented playful and gentle as well. She took her time educating me on my gum health. Their team is following very strict Covid safety protocols and they have aerosol suction devices close to your mouth in addition to the suctions used inside the mouth. The entire facility is state of the art and most importantly  is that it’s echo friendly.< /text>

<review>Sabrina is the best. She works the front and is always warm and welcoming while making sure everything is done efficiently.

Mercedes was the dental hygienist for my deep cleaning. She was quick and thorough with the cleaning. There was only 1 time I felt any discomfort and she remedied the issue quickly. Also the time flew by chatting it up with her.

Dr. Melko is very informative and open about the current status of your dental health and all the possible procedures/treatments that may apply. Extremely professional.

Great overall dental office.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><UserId.>113823869512089371460<//UserId.>< date>

<text>I was away from home and visiting Mt. View California and my front tooth veneer came off. Dr. Melko was very understanding and was able to see me the next afternoon. The office staff is kind and amazing, they follow all safety instructions for Covid 19. I felt safe and truly taken care of. I was seen right on time. My veneer is back on my tooth and it was prompt proffesional dental care. I highly recommend Dr. Melko dental office. If I ever move to Mt. View area she will be my dentist for sure.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I have been a patient there for over two years and have had some very complicated work done all of which I felt very informed about my treatment plan while it was happening and the expectations so there were no surprises.  Dr. Melko has a very gentle hand, explains what she is doing during the procedure, and does beautiful work at restoring smiles.  Her team, Sabrina and Christina, are awesome and always so friendly and welcoming too.  The whole team takes the time to get to know you personally and are not only invested your health and well being, but your happiness too.  Dentist visits are always nerve wracking (especially for me), but this team is incredible and it's why I still come see them even though I live in San Francisco, the team and the work done are all worth the drive!</text>< Pics>

From the moment you walk into Melko Dental you feel a positive energy, greeted by an amazing smile from the office manager Sabrina. I am offer tea and water while I await to be brought in by the hygienist Mercedas. The hygienist has a very gentle touch during the cleaning, Mercedes also has great pointers on how I should easily enforce flossing in my daily lifestyle. After my cleaning I was then seen by Dr.Melko she looked at all my teeth to make sure all my teeth are healthy! I can’t thank this team enough for the amazing care they have provided me all these years.

Melko Dental is HIGHLY recommend!</review>

Better than my previous dentist. Dr. Melko is very comforting. I liked that she didn't pressure me to get a root canal immediately when it didn't make sense with my insurance coverage limits. Dr. Melko is understanding and a nice person.

All the staff were super friendly and helpful every step of the way. I was a first time patient and got my appointment scheduled a few days after making contact with Melko Dental clinic. Everything was done in a professional manner and they’re taking the proper precautions against COVID-19.< /Text>

<Review>As soon as you walk in the door you are warmly welcomed by the receptionist, Sabrina. I would say she is more like an office manager. Everyone there is very friendly. The hygienist that cleaned my teeth was so gentle that I was pleasantly surprised when it was over.

Once I arrived at the office, the waiting room was comfortable and the receptionist was extremely friendly and nice. There was a short wait, then I went in for my cleaning, the cleaning was thorough and well done. Following the cleaning, Dr. Melko came in to check my teeth.

<text>This is a really top-notch office! Dr. Melko is smart and straightforward, with an excellent bedside manner, and someone I trust with my teeth. Beyond that, it's the office staff and the hygienists that really take the office from great to stellar—and why, even after moving, I'll still drive an hour through traffic for a regular cleaning! Cannot recommend Dr. Melko and her team highly enough.</text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

I found Dr. Melko's office via the Delta Dental Provider Search. I was initially impressed by their website and pictures of their facilities, which gave me the impression that they were focused on making a great practice based on a foundation of patient care. I've currently had two appointments, and in both instances, the appointment started right on time. From Sabrina in the front office and all of their staff, they make patients feel comfortable. They give clear explanations for the treatments both before and during the treatment. The office is clean and bright. It is a small practice, which makes things feel more personal.</Review>

Dr. Melko and her team are great. Sabrina at the front desk is friendly, efficient and helpful. Dr. Melko explains everything she is going to do and makes sure you are as comfortable as possible. She is also very thorough - I came in for a cleaning that was performed by a hygienist. When Dr. Melko came in to check out my teeth, she noticed a stain on one of my teeth that she thought she could quickly improve. Even though it was the end of my appointment and the end of her day, she took the time to polish away as much of the stain as she could and it definitely made a difference. I really appreciated it!< /Review>

The office staff is incredibly nice, accommodating with appointments, and considerate of one’s needs.  After my first exam, I was shocked to hear that I needed many, many cavity repairs and multiple new crowns and replacements; you would think my previous dentist would not have allowed the accumulation of so much tooth decay given that he was scheduling teeth cleanings every six months! I’m thankful Dr. Melko was able to start the dental repairs right away.< /text>

I thought my experience with Dr Melko was exceptional.  I am a physician myself, and I can tell when a medical professional is really skilled and competent.  Dr. Melko did extensive work on me, and she did an amazing job.  What I appreciated most was her bedside manner.  She honestly told me the pros and cons of different treatment choices, and what I liked most was that she was NOT trying to sell me anything.  She was focused instead on the best treatment choices for me.  She even mentioned that what another dentist recommended wasn’t necessary yet, and that we would keep a watchful eye before I had to pay the expense of additional treatment.  Her staff was great too.  In terms of downsides, the office was too warm for me temperature wise, but when I commented they made it more comfortable<//review>

< review>
I came to get some serious and sorely needed dental work done, and I was really dreading it– but Dr. Melko and the other staff members were all incredibly supportive and they really made the whole process quite easy. I was walked through my options, the process with my insurance was really transparent, and they were also very, very careful to make sure everything was numb before doing anything that would be painful, which I really appreciated, for obvious reasons :)

I'd definitely recommend them to anybody who has a fear of dentists' offices. It's just a really warm, welcoming place.<//review>

Just finished up my first visit to Melko Dental and I have nothing but fantastic things to say about my appointment. Clean and comfortable office, amazing staff that makes you feel welcome immediately, and an extremely proficient dental team. I had a top notch cleaning and was alerted to some gum recession that no other dentist or hygienist has told me about. I'm glad I got that heads up!  Highly recommended.<//review>

< Review>
Staff had a great attitude from the front desk to the dental chair. The ladylat the front desk (Sabrina?) is a joy to speak with and a great help with paperwork. This is the first time I've had constant suction from the dental assistant which I greatly appreciate. The doctor explained everything she was about to do from start to finish and was able to treat me without discomfort.</Review>

Very nice people (seriously, very very nice!), wonderful service and low price.

Sabrina in the front is extremely helpful and Terry, the hygienist spent a long time properly cleaning and explaining. They deeply care about the patients.< /review>

Best dentist I've been to. Dr Melko and her crew are available for you the whole time you're there, they make you feel safe and pay attention to everything in order to make your experience perfect.
Based on how great my experience was when I went there, I'm sure that this place will become popular soon. I hope that nothing will change once this team gets the fame it deserves. I hope they'll keep the listening ear, the smile and the professionalism.</Review>

Melko Dental is a wonderful dental practice. Everyone is friendly, helpful and professional. I've had two deep cleanings, an extraction, and two fillings done at this practice, and each experience was as pleasant/painless as possible for what is usually an unpleasant ordeal. I highly recommend them.<//Text>

Dr. Malek and his staff are the best.  I've been a patient here since 2011 and never have I left disappointed.  They take care of myself along with my two boys and do such a great job.  Their staff is so enthusiastic every time we come.  I would and do consider them friends.< /Text>

Just to indicate how satisfied I am with Malek Dental, I should mention that I drive from San Francisco to Malek Dental in Mountain View (about 45 minutes drive) every time, as opposed to going to a dental office in SF.  The staff is organized, friendly and courteous and Dr. Malek himself is definitely the best dentist I've ever had.  He is very meticulous in giving you the best care that you might need and he definitely is a very capable dentist.  He is very easy to share with any concerns that you might have regarding your dental health and he does a great jobs in addressing them.  I've had a couple of fillings with him and I couldn't be happier with the job he did on my teeth.  All of these qualities make my 1.5 hour drives every time I go to Malek Dental absolutely worthwhile :-)</Review>

We are so happy that our daughter's orthodontist recommended us to Malek Dental.
Every member of the team is extremely nice and Dr. Malek does an awesome job.
Now, our whole family visits his dental office regularly.
We all have been more than satisfied with the treatments we had. We have the great feeling that we can trust him regarding medical things that need to be done - or can wait.
Another big plus: You come in, and a very nice atmosphere (e.g. gentle music...) awaits you.
Justifiably, Dr. Malek is listed as one of Mountain View's interesting persons.
He and his team do great!</Text>

For many years I have been switching dentists every six months looking for a dentist that I can trust. A dentist who is honest, competent, knowledgeable, truly cares about the patient and does not push unnecessary procedures to rip you off.  Over all I have been very happy with my dental work and I hope this relationship could continue for long time.< /Text>

Update: I went in for a cleaning and they brought to my attention that my bottom teeth are not aligning up correctly with my top teeth, so causing some damage to my bottom teeth. They mentioned about Invisalign to me before but I just saw teeth straightening as something cosmetic. My boyfriend has mentioned to me before that I have to get it fixed before it messes up my other teeth. After hearing about straightening my teeth other then cosmetic reasons then I decided to get Invisalign. The staff helped me navigate through the whole process and gave me very helpful pointers, so here I am on my second set and smooth process so far. Thanks Melko Dental!

Original post:
I used to dread going to the dentist, but here I look forward to my visits. The environment is very friendly and they communicate with you through the whole process to let you know what to expect. I love that I can request for a blanket to keep me warm and also vaseline to prevent my lips from being dry at the end.<//Text>

first time going there. was very clean, quiet and polite. music is very enjoyable. my check up was fast and easy, found multiple issues that needed attention and I quickly scheduled future appointments. looking forward to getting a happy mouth with Dr. Melko!

Update: after extensive dental repairs and maintenance I truly value Dr. Melkos team and care. the staff is awesome and super friendly. my teeth look and feel great.

*EDIT TO MY ORIGONAL REVIEW*
I'ts been almost 3 years now and I have yet to have a bad visit. my teeth are happy, my smile looks great, and so does the staff. office is always clean and never a wait time. wish I could stay with this office but I will be moving on in a year; will be hard to find a replacement.<//text>

<review>Never have I ever encountered a business that was so clearly irritated and annoyed at a customer calling to try book an appointment. Worst attitude from whoever answered the phone yesterday. Thankfully I found a new dental practice to move my family to.</review>< Pictures>

Perform for Life is really the best. The second you walk into this community, you’re greeted with open arms from everyone. All movement specialists have a uniqueness to them with their own niches, and are all extremely knowledgeable in their craft. These coaches will go above and beyond to get you where you want to be. I've worked with Coach Dan and he is one of the realest you’ll ever meet. He’s honest about what he sees that needs improvement and will work diligently with you to reach your goals and then some. He isn’t hesitant to tell it like it is. During this time, he’s making sure all his athletes are out there and putting in the work with socially distanced 1:1 sessions in the park! 10/10 would recommend.</Text>

I had a virtual session with Coach Dan that was wonderful! I got a great workout that helped me feel strong and more aware of what my body is capable of. Coach Dan made it possible to do everything from home without the need to buy any equipment - making this the most accessible and enjoyable workout I have a had in the last few months! I highly recommend Coach Dan and Perform For Life!</review>

I trained with Anthony N. for 6 months and had the best experience at Perform For Life. Prior to starting, I had been recovering from a series of injuries to both my lower and upper half of my body, so I was a out of shape and had only finished my Physical Therapy a few months prior. After completing the assessment, I was paired up with Anthony N. who had also suffered from a shoulder injury before - and was well equipped with in his expertise on how to get my mobility and strength back. Anthony took his time with me, and was careful to not overwork certain problem areas until my body could handle it. This is not to say Anthony went easy on me when I did have the strength, but I appreciate Anthony's patience in allowing my body to grow at a safe pace. I highly recommend Perform For Life (regardless of the location) if you are somehow who is looking for an intimate training session with a knowledgeable fitness specialist, or looking for a small group training class that is not 30+ people piled into a room.

Lastly, the gym plays great music! I know music is subjective, but it's not just top 100s on repeat every single day. Some gyms in the city will just play the same station every single week, and it gets tiring to hear. Good music does wonders for a workout session.

Thanks for all the hard work Anthony! You've made me a stronger person because of it. Thank You P4L!<//text>

I had a virtual session with Coach Dan that was absolutely awesome - I was able to get a great workout! I have a fused ankle and the best part was feeling safe and comfortable doing exercises while knowing Coach Dan knows his stuff. I have already recommended Coach Dan and Perform For Life to others!< /text>

<Text>Where do I start, this P4L gym is amazing! I've been to this location a few times and would rate my experience 5 stars each visit. Clean bathrooms, sanitized equipment, and new weights!

Awesome energy and knowledgable trainers ~ they are extremely eager to help and will take time to teach you fundamentals if you've never seen the exercise before.

They take time to listen and understand what you are striving for ~ WILL help you meet and exceed your goals, while having fun!

The classes are the right amount of intensity for everyone, and you'll love the workout supersets. I'll be back again, next time I choose the music! THANK YOU COACH DAN!<//Text>< Pics>

Small Group classes here are excellent!  The 7:10pm HIIT-Strength Monday and Thursday classes are great!   I’ve been taking the classes for almost a year now, started with Coach Becca and now Coach Jon.  He’s personable and keeps the motivation up after a long day!  You can make it as challenging as you need, with a max 8 people he’ll guide you to do the exercises correctly.  There are regulars to the class, and seeing the great fun people in my classes makes working out something to look forward to!   The other group classes are great too when I get a chance to do them, but I’m glad P4L has a 7:10pm class as that works best with my schedule!<//text>

It was my second time taking a group exercise class with Perform For Life, but my first time taking a Small Group Class at this location. I took the class with Coach Jon and it was definitely one of the sweatiest classes that I've been to. He went through all of the exercises clearly before we began each circuit. The exercises made my muscles burn-in a good way, and by the end of the class I was ready to just lie on the floor. Coach Jon is funny and engaging with the rest of the class and encourages each person to do their best. While I haven't taken many classes at P4L, it's clear that he wants us to know that everybody at P4L is a part of the family.< /Text>

<Text>Been doing small group classes and I love it. Very challenging in a great way. The coaches pay a lot of attention and adjust the exercise for your skill level (both easier and harder). I love that there are different workouts with different coaches to change it up as well! Everyone has been so nice. It definitely has more of a community feel that I haven't seen at most gyms. Would highly recommend P4L!<//Text>< pictures>

He is new coach but he goes extra mile to make sure that you perform exercise correctly. He also experiments with routine to find what will fit better for specific group. I definitely recommend P4L gyms to anyone who wants to stay fit and healthy.< /Text>< Pics>

Almost 4 years later this is my second home. With my continuous struggle of scoliosis I decided to enhance my life with adding one on one trainings at P4L. I avidly did the shared personal training sessions which was and still is exhilarating, effective, and powerful. My choice to get one to one personal training was to hone in on getting a better quality of life and really getting the help to find exercises to enhance my performance. Cheri has been my personal trainer for almost a year now and I am extremely fascinated by her technique and ability to scientifically find exercises that have really enhanced my life. She is extremely educated, present, & filled with knowledge. Every session I feel stronger, challenged, and supported. She is tactful and really takes the time to curate the best movements and techniques to make me stronger. Best decision I have made to take care of myself more.</Text>

I did group exercise classes for a few months here. The gym was too small for me. The size really limited the amount of different exercises one could do so you were doing pretty much the same workouts every week. The classes were also too crowded when they were full and often the classes you wanted would fill up before you could get a spot. The coaching was ok given their constraints though.</Text>

Over a year ago I walked in with a complex goal of losing weight, getting stronger, being more flexible, and finding a regular routine I would commit to. That's a pretty complex ask. They simplified it, into a series of personal and group tasks. My coach, Austin, made our 1 on 1 sessions a place to mark incremental progress, tracking gradual increases in weights and reps to keep me motivated. Taking classes between sessions kept the momentum up while bringing a lot cardio into the strength building. And with so many different instructors with different styles--Melissa, Charles, Amber, Anthony--it stays fresh and different. In six months P4L has met and exceeded my expectations. I'm very thankful for such a engaged and dedicated staff<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I went to P4L to have my run labs done and would highly recommend for anyone looking to take their fitness to the next level. I have been a competitive athlete for 15 years and continue to compete at a high level in amateur Muay Thai. Getting my run labs done was an awesome way to pinpoint specific areas in my physical fitness that I could work on to make gains in my overall performance and how to stay healthy for the future. Walking in, this place has a great energy and you can tell that there is a personal relationship with the trainers and their clients. I worked with Pita and Maddie during the 2 hour labs that we did which included checking flexibility, stabilizer muscles, analyzing my gate and VO2 max amongst other things.  They use cutting edge technology and video to help provide you with visuals. They are easy to work with and we laughed the whole time. At the end of the session, I left feeling happy and uplifted even though these were people that I had just met.  Even if you are just starting to get into sports/exercise, this is a great test to get your baseline fitness and help identify goals moving forward. Thank you P4L! :)< /Text>< resp>

<Text>The entire staff at P4L is so welcoming and awesome to work with! Small Group training is always challenging and fun!

I trained with Charles for three months to prep for my wedding and it was the best choice I could have made!  Charles has a great way of pushing me to do things that I would never do working out on my own, while also helping to understand the mechanics and the reason why I am doing the exercises.  Charles' laid back attitude and calming presence makes workouts fly by.   He consistently listened to the exercises I enjoyed and helped to tailor my workouts to the things I enjoyed.

Most importantly, I can see a huge difference in my strength and body composition since starting to work with Charles.  I had particular areas that I wanted to target for my wedding dress - Charles not only improved those areas but also improved my entire body.  He paid attention to my body composition and my strengths and weaknesses and worked to improve those.< /Text>< pics>

Coaches at P4L are really knowledgeable when it comes to treating your body right, conditioning, training etc...  I love the gym atmosphere, everyone is really supportive. I’ve taken boxing and strength/conditioning classes. Coach B instructs you through rigorous boxing workouts, I would recommend this class to anyone. Coach Charles instructed me through one of the hardest workouts after a long day at work. If you want to relieve some stress take one or both of these classes, they will not disappoint. Keep up the good work P4L Coaches!✌🏾<//review>

Hands down, P4L is the best gym & personal training experience I've ever had. Not only are the classes fun and challenging, but they are small enough to where you still get individualized attention. The coaches truly do care about their clients and helping them meet their fitness goals. My trainer, Brandon, really pushed me to show up. In fact, I don't think he EVER missed 1 day in the 9 months we trained together! The owners, Bryan and Justine, have really set such a high industry standard that I've yet to see in any other gym. Not only are all of the coaches knowledgable and constantly learning about topics in their industry, but it's evident that they are passionate about their work. This isn't just "a job" that they show up to (sadly, like most gym trainers I've had). It's a lifestyle that they are excited and committed to, and they're passionate about getting other people to love fitness. My favorite thing about Perform for Life is the community that they've built - Bryant and Justine, along with all of the coaches and even the clients!, are all so kind and genuine. Look no further - THIS is IT!</Text>

<Text>I've been doing the group training classes for about a month now at P4L and I wish I had started earlier!  I already feel and look way more fit and I've noticed I'm more energetic and focused throughout the day.

I've had group training classes with Charles, Nathan, Amber, and Anthony so far.  They all are very welcoming and they bring their own individual personality and fitness background to their classes. The group sessions offer a HIIT interval training style with a combination of body weight exercises, free weights, and stretching.

If you're looking for a fun and rewarding way to jump-start your  physical activity level, I highly recommend trying this place out!

<text>Best. Gym. Ever. I've been training at Perform for Life on and off for nearly three years. Recently, I've been working with trainer Michael Phillips, trying to improve my weight lifting numbers. Michael has done an amazing job of providing structure to my workouts and helping me see major gains in all of the big lifts (deadlift, squat, bench press). Everyone at the gym is incredibly knowledgeable in all things fitness, and they apply this knowledge in practical ways to help improve your form, prevent injuries, and see big gains. I'd recommend personal training at P4L without reservation for anyone who has hit a plateau in their fitness journey and need that extra push to take things to the next level.<//text>< Time>

I love everything about the P4L community. These days the title personal trainer does not mean too much, however the trainers at Perform for Life are indeed Movement Specialists. They take a personal approach by listening to your goals, doing an assessment, and help get you moving in the right direction. Plus, their community events are a blast. While P4L is not my primary gym, I still look to their faculties for my training and health approach. Appreciate you guys!< /Review>

Overall an excellent gym. Great coaches all around. I want to single out Coach Eva, she’s awesome. She started an Olympic lifting program from the ground up at this gym that is definitely the reason I keep coming. We have a cool mini-community with people on the same wavelength wanting to move more weight around and do more explosive movements than the small group classes allow with how many people are in them. It’s an awesome way to be able to track measured progress of performance in a way that’s more engaging for me than worrying about numbers on a scale. Only reason for the loss of the star is because it seems like management is getting a little dicey with the scheduling of the oly classes. Built out a new location that’s perfect for it with platforms and everything, put oly classes on the schedule then cut them a couple days later with no notice. Seems like it’s short circuiting a really cool aspect of this gym that was starting to grow. These classes are literally the reason I come and it’s rough to see them deprioritized like this.< /text>

It's an amazing experience every time, they pay attention to my form during each exercise and motivate me to be my best.  I have become stronger, more flexible, and more in tuned with my body.  Their workouts also target muscles I don't usually focus on when I'm by myself and improve on everyday movements.  They have a great team who are friendly, professional, and FUN FUN FUN!!!  I look forward to my workout every time.  Thank you P4L!!!!</Text>< pics>

It's been exactly one year since I started personal training sessions at Perform For Life and I'm so happy I found this place! I started out seeing Amber 2x a week and now see her only 1x a week. Amber goes above and beyond and makes sure I'm also exercising and maintaining a healthy lifestyle out of our sessions. She'll even go so far as creating workouts for me on days I am not at P4L. The P4L fam is the best. Thanks!<//text>

These are legit personal trainers. I met the owner Bryant who has the background and  knowledge to help get me physically to the next level for my golf game. Titleist Performance Institute Certified. We spent the first hour screening my movement which gave him a clear roadmap  for me. Five star!< /review>

I've been attending small group fitness classes for 5 months and I am the strongest I've ever been. All the coaches are motivating and genuinely kind people. The weekday morning classes are a great mix of body weight, dumbbell, kettle bell, and TRX training - with some HIIT thrown in. The coaches are also always working to improve the gym - open to suggestions and critiques. Love P4L!< /Text>

<Review>I absolutely love Perform For Life!! The best decision I made to further my boxing career was to step inside of this amazing gym.

The energy once you step inside is GREAT and very WELCOMING. The entire staff as a whole makes it a very comfortable and great place to be. I've been going to a cooperate gym since 2005 and I got use to seeing personal trainers usually just sitting there on their phones while watching the client work, looking very uninterested, not engaged and basically the trainer just looks like he/she is going through things out of a book. Not here at Perform for Life. The specialist here not only look the part but they are fully engaged with their individual client. That goes for the group classes as well. I usually go to Charles's Friday morning group session and it's best group fitness class I've ever taken. With it being a small group setting it makes itnintimate to where you would get lost in the shuffle within those super huge fitneas classes and would be doing an exercise completely wrong and might even hurt yourself in the process.

Outside of the fitness spectrum, I love the fact that Perform for Life GIVES BACK. They volunteer their time at Glide Memorial, I see that they give back to the youth and they are for the community. The shows a lot of integrity and who they are not just as a gym but as a people. A place like that will always have my business and support.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1502913849594, 'text': 'Wowwww, these kind words gave us goosebumps!

For years I became a creature of habit and continued to do exercises that were not producing results and in the end unfortunately creating injuries & discomfort to no end where I felt I was going to give up. Through training with Bryant & Justine not only have I become stronger, leaner, and got my groove back, I was given the confidence that I can do anything. My body has seen results that I never thought was possible because the founders have the capability & intuition to provide an all encompassing workout that will make you the best version of yourself. Their amount of knowledge is insane and their ability to be personable makes you feel like you have known them for ever. Every time I walk into P4L I am filled with such high energy and every time I walk out I feel like I achieved a new milestone.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate><gmap_id>0x8085809ff89c7e1d:0x68a7acd3a3e45dc6</gmap_id><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>During 2016 I had four gyms, Perform For Life is the best! PFL is a unique combination of talent and community that combines to make it the best experience in SF.

All of the trainers teaching all of the classes and doing private sessions have kinesiology degrees. You won't find this background at your other local gyms. The owners work hard to provide the best product wrapped in awesome customer service, love, and community. This is a great place to meet and foster friendships while achieving your personal best. I cannot recommend them enough. I've worked with almost all of the trainers and all are amazing. I think you'll be impressed.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Text>Recently I told Amber how pleased I was with our work together.  Through my work with her over the months, I have begun to make the transition from a person who had to go to exercise to help improve the odds of keeping my cancer in check, to a person who is beginning to think of exercise as a part of my personality and a valued lifestyle choice.
Amber shows unusual skill in gauging the exercises to my ability.  It often seems as if she starts a set of exercises with a low-ball warm-up resistance.  In subsequent sets I get to request more weight.  That experience of wanting to do more, to work harder is, for me, a unique experience around exercise.   By low-balling resistance and working up, Amber models and teaches a kind of patience that I had never associated with exercise and allows me to experience a quite novel experience in myself of eagerness around exercise combined with patience about the results.  Despite my impatience with her cautious approach, I often wind up feeling manageable muscle soreness after workouts which makes me feel just a bit of the self-righteous and heroic warrior.

Amber shows unexpected inventiveness in hitting the same basic muscle groups in novel ways as well as a consistency of attention to proper form which is unaccustomed to me.  This keeps my workouts interesting and also works all possible associated peripheral muscles. It also contributes to the impression that she really thinks hard about how to make the workouts interesting and entertaining.  She is also so consistent about monitoring the basics of good body mechanics that I now anticipate the corrections she is about to make.  This makes it easier to integrate our training into my daily activity.  For example, I now experience brisk walking as an exercise in awareness in balancing the demands on my legs and calves with my buttocks and back chain.  When lifting, I remind myself to anchor my lats and pay attention to not over-stressing my shoulder joints.  Over the months, my posture has greatly improved, and friends tell me that I am looking much stronger.

Amber is unexpectedly organized in the way that she presents her exercises. She typically starts with warm-ups, presents the main core of our workouts in in sets of 2 or 3 exercises targeting opposing muscle groups, each set repeated three times before moving on to the next set.  She finishes with some playful cool-downs and balance exercises.  This gives me a way to think about the structure of a workout session which has been very helpful to me in beginning to explore working out at home.

Amber's personality and attitudes present a good fit with my personality needs, which has been very helpful in encouraging me to think of exercise as an enjoyable part of my lifestyle.  She is professional about maintaining some distance between her needs and mine, yet not so distant that I don't feel that I have come to know her as a person and feel a sense of her genuine caring and playfulness.  She has skillfully managed all the negative personality traits and unproductive attitudes that I brought to exercise.  For example, each workout she cheerfully and genuinely encourages me to complain about whatever is interfering with my desire to exercise - and then tells me to get going.  She models using one's body with all its limitations as best as one can at the time.  Again and again, I have had the experience of coming in grumpy and unmotivated and leaving feeling energized and successful.  An experienced exerciser may take this for granted, but believe me, this experience is unaccustomed in my life, especially as I have aged and since my cancer treatment.

To the extent possible, I think that Amber brings a quality of broad knowledge, professional attitudes, consistent effort, and playfulness  to our workouts that encourages me to think about my daily activities as potential opportunities to reinforce my workouts and to gladly integrate exercise more deeply into my life.  And that is what Perform for Life is all about.</Text>< Rate>

I started my fitness journey here at P4L in 2014.They made working out fun for me. Their trainers were great and very knowledgeable, made me feel at ease and safe. I had to leave due to personal reasons but the health and fitness seed that P4L planted in me kept growing. Now I’m finally back, YAY!!!The atmosphere is still the same, warm and inviting. The trainers, there’s more!! Which means different workout routines because no trainer trains the same and I personally love that!! The fact that P4L was always in the back of my mind no matter where I was doing Fitness or falling off, lol, says a lot about P4L. They left a great impression on me and I’m so happy to be back!< /Text>

<Text>I am a person who hates working out and all things gym related, including weird gym culture. This is the first place where I feel extremely comfortable and actually look forward to my personal training sessions as well as group classes. My gf initially dragged me here for personal training sessions and the whole experience from signup to actual sessions was well above my expectations. Bryant and Justine listened to my hesitations about "gym life" and reiterated that P4L fosters a extremely open and non-judgmental culture and is most importantly, fun.

Charles is our PT and is great. He listens to your fitness goals and constructs something that is realistic and challenging, but also enjoyable. So far it's been a great experience and couldn't recommend both P4L and Charles enough. Thanks guys!<//Text>< Pictures>

Perform for Life has changed my life with their dedication to overall health and wellness. I've been going for three years now and it's hands-down the best place for fitness in SF. I've tried everything from muay thai, to big-box gyms, barre, spinning...you name it - and Perform for Life has been the only place that I'm excited to go back to. In three years, I have not done one same workout, I'm constantly challenged and I'm part of a community/family there that I love!<//Review>

I currently reside in LA, but when I visit SF I always make an effort to work out at P4L w/ Coach Bryant. Bryant conducts full body assessments and suggests helpful modifications for my bilateral tendinitis in my arms. His specialized workouts cater to what my body needs, and I feel safe that I will not further injure myself. I have gained a lot of strength and mobility during our sessions and have continued to follow his regimen here in LA. I would also like to mention that Bryant referred me to Bob, who’s speciality is in Clinical Body Work. Bob helped me tremendously when I had an acute flare up of tendinitis in my achilles. After a session with Bob, I was no longer limping, and my pain decreased drastically. The next time I am in town, I will definitely be training with Coach Bryant! 💪🏻<//text>

<Text>Having been to many different gyms, P4L has definitely been the best. Feeling comfortable and confident that your trainers really know what they're doing is so important. I have had injury problems for years and have often had issues with trainers at other gyms not giving me the correct exercises based on those injuries. But at P4L, I know that I can trust that they are giving me exercises tailored to me that will only help improve my health and not aggravate my injuries. The few corrective exercises that they've given me thus far have been very helpful for my chronic back pain! Furthermore, going to P4L is always an enjoyable experience because every person is outgoing and friendly. They all make a point to learn your name and ask you about your day. Being a part of P4L is like being a part of a community rather than just being a member of a gym. Perform for Life is 100% deserving of it's #1 rating and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to go to a gym with top notch service and quality!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

My experience with P4L has been exceptional & rewarding so far. I Found out about p4l threw my girlfriend , she  is friends with coach charels, & they went to Sf state together! He had reached out to her trying to get intouch with me cause he had known I compete in mixed martial arts. Finally  I got in contact with coach charels, & I came down one day did my assessment, automatically felt comfortable with everyone, & it was a  good environment to work in. I was able to meet coach Bryant , coach Justine and coach Brandon that same day as well! These guys down here are professionals at what they do!!! They obtain the knowledge to help you with your personal needs, being a professional athlete or even someone who just wants to get in shape. I've never felt more stronger, faster and sharper than I do right now! They really do care for there ppl down here! They assist you in the areas you want to focous on & also make sure your work ethic is up to par. They are there to not only help you, but push you to do better! You come down here it's like one big family everyone working real hard day in day out, everyone says hi to you and bye when they leave, this stuck out to me because I come from traditional martial art school, and this is what they teach respect all your coachs and training partners! This is hands down the best gym in the Bay Area! I been here for 2 fight camps and pulled 2 spectacular performances of my Career thus far, and will be part of the P4L family for a very long time! Coach  Charles Armstrong  and coach Brandon are some beasts foreal! The whole staff are!!! I highly recommend this gym for everyone!!!!</Text>

I've come to this gym for the small group classes and I absolutely love them.  One class was led by a resident boxer so we worked on throwing different punches with a partner and boxing-oriented training exercises.  I go here to get a great all-around workout with these small classes.  The different instructors keep things interesting and fresh every time.  They keep a close eye on you ask well to make sure you're doing the exercise right so you don't injure yourself (something the instructors at my climbing gym could learn from since I guess I'm the only one who's not a ripped adonis there).  The atmosphere is SUPER friendly, helpful, and welcoming to all skill and fitness levels.  They have all the equipment and very nice ammenities like a  couple of changing rooms in the back and a full on showah for those of you who get extra Sweaty McSweats before a day at the office. Charles is a pretty dope trainer, too!</text>

Every single small group fitness classes is taught by expert trainers who are also available for 1:1 sessions. Once you've hurt yourself at Crossfit or your wallet at Equinox you should come and meet the gorgeous and talented team and local community patrons at PFL. You won't regret it.</review>< pictures>

Hard to find a decent haircut place like this during pandemic without rising the price while I was there asking for a hair cut. They took care of me and I like the hair cut they did. Thank you.</review>

<Review>I LOVE this salon! I live right across the street, so I have visited frequently. All of the staff are skilled and professional. Supercuts has a Check In process online, and this location also accepts phone calls to get checked in. Sometimes there is a short wait,  so I usually check in during busy times, such as weekends. This salon is located in a Strip Mall and has a lot of parking. Prices are very reasonable for all services, which include haircuts, styling, and color. They also sell many great products.  This Hair Salon is an EXCELLENT place to get hair cuts for the entire family. They have a punchcard that offers a free haircut after 10 haircuts. I am in the process of moving out of the area, and I wanted to take this opportunity to THANK all the staff at this Supercuts! Thank you Nicole, Natasha, Lisa and Megan I will miss you all.</Review>< Rate>

The lady did a perfect job on my hair. She took a lot of time on it and it came out way better than many other places I have been. The wait was kind of long but she made up for it! 5 stars for sure<//Review>

<Review>Adriana is amazing!! I went in for a "long bob" cut and was too afraid to go too short because I've always had long hair, and she respected that. She washed and cut my hair and followed instructions very well. Just a few days later I was feeling like I should just go for it and go shorter, so I went back to Adriana and asked that we go shorter, and she took me in that same day and made my hair look amazing  I absolutely love it! I highly recommend going to Adriana!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2dbdf0269d7f9:0xb6ccb6187111834b</GmapID></record>

Been going here for a few years, great for a good and quick haircut. Use the app to go when it is not as busy - although the check-in feature is useless as you will still wait when you get there.</Review>

A wonderful hair dresser(sorry I forgot your name) fixed my disaster haircut I got earlier and made it look great. The hairdresser had long blonde hair at the time with, I think black in it, or maybe her makeup was black. IDR but this place was great. I'm definitely going back.<//text>

<resp>None</resp><text>First of all the customer service was amazing. I placed a special birthday order and I was not turned down. . ( I've had that occur at other B.R.) The cake artist is super talented and amazingly sweet. I highly recommend custom birthday cakes at only this location. My theme was PS4 for a very thrilled 12 year old. I've come here for the last two years for my son because Oreo Ice Cream cake is his favorite. Anyway, thank you Baskin Robbins team on Western and Franklin.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

Customer service was poor.  Anytime your product is overpriced you are suppose to compensate by great customer service.  Just go to Rite Aid across the street for your ice cream.</Text>

<Text>It must have been the cashier's first day. The person "in charge" didn't know what he was doing. Both the fish and chips were sitting under the heat lamp for a while. I will not be going back.  I guess I'll be looking for another place to get my fish and chips for the remainder of Lent<//Text>< rate>

Great food, professional staff and great location.  I recommend posting a larger advertisement sign so non-locals can locate this establishment more easily.< /Text>

I had to go back and forth to pick up my food then my moms food. I returned to get sauces and a to go box. Each time I went up I was greeted by Ryan with a smile and he was very helpful. I felt like he enjoyed  his Job. Hopefully he will be appreciated by  this restaurant.< /review>< Rating>

Always good,never got a bad shrimp or funky fish.You might have to wait a few min, remember fresh fryed food is best
if it hasen't been sitting for a half hour.

Make sure you don't try to use a Long John Silver gift card here because they won't honor it! So basically they have my money tied up in a card and I'm unable to use it. Terrible!<//review>

I will never order nor will I come here again. Drive thru was backed up and employees having conversation. I order my mom food n mine food and I had too wait exactly 13 mins for my food. They just put stuff in my bag and didnt tell me wat it was so before I left I checked our bags and l ask him was this for and they gave us cookies for the long wait then I ask for fries and he gave me mash potatoes and gravy and l ask him where is my fries, he said Oh we ran out, l told him why didnt u tell me that, he didnt answer me so l just gave him the mash potatoes and gravy back and left. Bad customer service and lacking on drive thru, also no communication. Ill never come back here</Review>

< review>
I New this place in 2019 with my wife and we were impressed by the high quality of the massage, I came this year and was absolutely amazing, I have this place to come back every time I visit San Diego!!!
I m from Spain but travel around the world and love that massage but this place is the best I ever been, Jenny was this time the massage therapist and she is very professional and highest level you can find 👌🎯
I was very stiff in my back and after 3 days I was new!!!
Thanks very much and hope to come back soon 😍</review>

💆‍♀️ BEST THAI MASSAGE EVER!

So the place from the outside looks sketchy it's downtown San Diego, when you enter you may also question the inside at face value 😬 but I've went back several times:

Hands down best Thai massage!
Super friendly
Firm pressure
Great technique
Best price

If you haven't gotten a Thai massage or don't want firm/hard pressure you will need to let them know ahead of time.< /Text>

<Text>My husband and I flew in to SD and decided to get Thai massages.  I have had a few Thai massages in the past both NOTHING compared to the Deep Tissue Massage I had at Little Thai Massage.  My therapist literally walked on my back and used her feet to work deep into my tight muscles.  It was absolutely amazing!  Highly recommend!  🖐 ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️< /Text>< rate>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I've gotten many sport and deep tissue massages before but this was my first Thai massage. It was awesome. They do offer more gentle and relaxing swedish massages if deep pressure isn't your thing. Be prepared to throw modesty out the door because they stretch you walk in you and massage you draped with a sheet but it does move around. The language barrier might be off putting to some but it didn't really bother me. Highly recommended if you enjoy Thai massage, deep tissue or sports massage.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

A friend and I were visiting San Diego and wanted massages. From the outside, I wasn’t sure what to think but the other Google reviews convinced me that we should walk in.... and this place was amazing! It was probably one of the best massages I’ve ever had. It’s clean and professional. I highly recommend!</Review>

My certified massage therapist is named Diana. We came in very last minute. They got us right in. I will never go to anyone else. I had back issues and haven't felt this good in MONTHS! She is absolutely amazing and I can't wait to go back! The price is also amazing. Everything is clean and has a relaxing aesthetic.</text>

I was a in town for a meeting and was looking for a place at the last minute that would be open rather late. It was easy to get an appointment. I was very impressed right on the arrival with cleanness of the place. It’s a small place with devided curtains but don’t let this bias you. I have had the best massage ever by Dianne, and believe me I’ve had a lot of massages. I loved how she combined traditional massage with stretching and hot stones. If I could stay there all night I would :-). I wish I lived closer, but next time I’m in town I will most defiantly come back for a session. I would very highly recommend this place.< /text>

<text>I really enjoyed this massage, it was my first time getting the Thai massage (I got a 60 min combo massage, I've had Swedish before). All the stretches with the pressure is absolutely perfect and you will leave feeling refreshed! Especially for those that feel they dont get enough pressure when they go for massages as they can use full body weight if you prefer. They really seem to find all them points and work them. The only thing that could have been better would have been warming the lotion/oil  or having the room a few degrees warmer but really it wasn't a big deal. So that being said, i definitely recommend treating yourself to some self care and giving their massage place a try :)<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

As a frequent traveler looking to find high quality massage services, traveling to any new city gives me a little apprehension; however when arriving at Little Thai Massage & Body Work today in San Diego, Maya made me feel extremely comfortable, will definitely be back!

Great service, amazing massage, stretch, and joint popping,  and great rates!

<Review>Lisa and Mia are excellent professionals.
We went there with pains and could almost not move due to lumbago. After their treatment we were like new and the mobility was back. They know exactly what the are doing. We can only highly recommend them.
Next time we go to San Diego we definitely will book them.
Deep thanks again Lisa and Mia.<//Review><Time>1520200766451< /Time>< Rating>

They said they offered deep tissue so I went in for exactly that.  My upper back and neck were killing me.  I told the masseuse explicitly that's what I came in for.  Instead, I was given a general run down.  Hot stones, the masseuse stepping on various parts of my body, and a back stretch that I did not ask for.  Very disappointing.  I left with a $65 loss, and my neck and back still killing me.  Unless you just want a general Thai massage, I would suggest you go to another place that will actually listen to you.<//Review>

I called and booked an appointment on that same day and explained the situation. They took me in right away and I wobbled my way in. It was my first time getting a Thai massage and I did not know what I was expecting. Trust me, the whole process was very painful as Mya stepped on me and dug her heels into all the knots accumulated in my body. But the good pain was very much needed, for I felt relief right away! She was very caring the whole time, and made sure it wasn’t too much for me to handle. Will be back again!< /review><rate>5< /rate>< time>

I came to this place a few weeks ago and I have to say I was pretty disappointed. My therapist was really really sweet but they did not work on the spots I specifically asked them to & it actually really hurt at times when she was massaging, which has never happened in other massages I have gotten. I left feeling more sore afterwards, which shouldn't have happened because I have gotten plenty of massages before. Also, since there are no walls between the other massage tables, it was very loud. I could hear the other therapists talking and the other clients in their treatments which made me a bit uncomfortable. The massage therapist I was with even left the session with me for about 10 minutes to take care of another client who had just walked in, where they were talking very loudly. It definitely took me out of a relaxed state and made the massage less enjoyable, especially since it made my massage that I paid for less time. I was bummed that I spent my money on something I did not feel satisfied with afterwards - I would love to try this place a second time to change my mind but would not want to spend my money again.< /text>

Went for 1 hr but since my masseuse ( Maya) was so good and she was available I extended it to 1 1/2.
Great! Great experience! After asking me if I had pain and etc she went straight to the center of my pain.
I have been suffering pain shoulder for almos 2 months. Chiropractor and mainstream doctors could only give steroids which didn’t solve the problem.
After my massage I am FREE pain! I am not local but will certainly return to Little Thai Massage Loc 2 when back in SAN.
Oh and last but not least: price??? Unbelievable great!!
Absolutely worth!<//Review>

It took awhile to get in, but that was a good thing. It meant they were up and running. We actually tried to go to Chili's first, only to find out they closed at 4pm. They had no staff. Everyone wants to sit at home and collect free money from those of us that work for our money. Anyway, our server was very friendly, very attentive, and polite. The food was delicious, and served just the way we requested. We had friends in from out of town, and stayed longer than we maybe should have. But they didn't seem to mind, nor did they ask us to leave. Had we seen they had people waiting to be seated though, we'd have left. I hope more people will go out to these restaurants that are open. And please be sure to give them a good tip!<//review>

<text>Although I was initially drawn by the fact they have seafood to accompany the steak. I happened to be there on a Wednesday, and there was the special walkabout Wednesday deal, which has a 5oz steak with a side and small draft beer for $10.99. Limited choice of domestic beer, more specifically, 2 choices.
Most items on the menu are priced higher than I thought it’d be; nothing special about the steak and under par with the price I see on the menu. Rather go to Red Lobster for the quality and price.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>I ordered a steak rare plus and got exactly what I asked for. Many people I go out with rather medium rare however, I'm from a place where meat cooked rare is best. As far as sea food goes. My girlfriend loved her grilled shrimp appetizer, the sauce served with it was extraordinary. Overall  i enjoyed my experience and will 100% come back again. Thank you my server Kim, and the owner Leah.<//Text>< pictures>

The service was very good. The food was ok. I ordered prime rib and it was a lil chewy. I ordered it outback style but I guess they don't do that anymore. The pasta with steak and shrimp was pretty good. Steak was much better than the shrimp. The restrooms were disgusting! Me and my husband both went and it was really bad. Not sure if we'll be going back anytime soon.<//text>

Best value steak in town. We shared the 9oz filet mignon between us. Baked sweet potato with a hunk of butter is delicious!

Parking is easy, the Clairemont Town Square mall has a ton of stores, so it's one destination for pretty much all the family needs.</Review>

<Review>Tried to order and was told they are closed they turn off their grills and close the kitchen at 830 so they can close by 9. I called at 840 for two items that do not require a grill. All I wanted was soup. But was told I can't order after having had to call twice because the first time they would not answer. Extremely disappointed. Will not come here and will suggest others stay away as well.</Review><resp>{'time': 1619206115326, 'text': "We appreciate you letting us know about your experience.

Picked up curb side takeaway for dinner.  The food was very good flavor.  I ordered grilled chicken, Mac and Cheese, slow roasted prime rib, and pork chop dinners.  The pork chops were a little over cooked, but tasty.< /review>

< review>
To compete with Black Angus restaurant, the Outback has steak and seafood specials that blow them away.  The steaks are noticably better quality and way more tender than at Black Angus.  The seafood is better than at Red Lobster. The servers are super friendly and eager to make suggestions.  If you are lucky your server will be Victor G.  He is the best server we've had in 10 years, not just at the Outback.  He treats you like you are at a five star gourmet restaurant.  If the Outback is smart they will promote Victor so he will be the regional trainer of all new servers, followed by managing his own restaurant.  He takes pride in his work and does his best to please you.  That's something I've never seen at a chain restaurant.</review>

<review>This visit turned out to be a bad experience. First time ordering via online and won't be doing it again. In all actuality, it was a total waste of $104.00. Did a review the same night on the app as requested. It said they would respond in 24 to 48 Hours....here it is 6 days later, and no response from anyone. Just not happy with this Outback location right now and definitely not happy with Corporate at the moment. With everything going on right now, one would think that Customer Service would be a major priority, but, apparently not.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Covid precautions. This location does not have Sailor Jerry's rum 😪
Shrimp add on comes on bread now like it use to.
Waiter was nice and added some garlic butter because the shrimp looked dry. Great customer service.< /Review>

I generally enjoy the food but tonight I had a large order with a 6 oz filet minion . The filet was cooked the way I like it but the meat itself had so much gristle in it that you could not even cut it. I ended up giving it to my dogs.</review>

Well , they just told me not to come back after 20 years of eating there , a few weeks ago i order to pick up like i do . And my food was ready just setting there but the manager and new guy thought they would go through there work schedule . Instead of giving me my food i sat there watching them for 5 mins . So i got out and knocked on the window it scared them i guess . The new guy turned around scared like and got my bag as i pointed at it . He opened the door with one arm out with bag i took it and left . And been there a few times since then . But tonight the new guy was there hearing my voice in the middle of my order he told me to hold on for some reason a long few minutes later an manager got on and told me i had an altercation there . I said never . He said well you did and you can not come back . Wow this is unbelievable because i knocked on the window.  Then i called back to talk to the manager about this . He was no help just keep saying i was at fault . Then the manager had the nerve to say i was not talking right like i was drunk.  I was very surprised by that and i  told him i had mouth surgery from cancer and it's hard to talk . I am surviving from this cancer i don't need this . And the manager hung up on me thinking i was drunk . I don't drink in the first place . What is going on people 😕< /review>

<Review>This Outback is inconsistent in both vegetables and  steak, as well as cooking knowhow.  I was a regular until the new franchise owner took over and now I will no longer go there due to consistent problems with food, service and personnel / management not doing a satisfactory job at fixing or resolving issues. 2 specific issues are they randomly change the side order vegetables when they are too expensive for them to purchase for the store which is just unheard of in other chains of stores. Like for instance brocolli, carrots, and califlower, changed to asparagus, and then to green beans. So the menu is always wrong. They also consistently undercook steak and then want you to immediately resolve it with the chefs by sending THAT steak back to be cooked more. I understand the concept. However this is uncomfortable and embarrasing and the steak never tastes right in a second cooking. Then they argue about not charging you for unacceptable food or service after waiting 15 more minutes for your recooked steak while your entire table eats without you! And this has happened to me several times since the changeover of owners/ management. I even gotten my steak back 10 minutes later still uncooked (pic included)   Please, dont accept rude or arguementative behavior from the owner at this store. Or just dont go there.  Ive also called Outback corporate for assistance because i would have liked to resolve this somehow, but they do not seem to return calls. I also gave the new owner a few chances to resolve this with me but she just argues for no reason. I will always miss eating here, and wish it was the same Outback ive gone to for almost 20 yrs. But it isnt the same so just go with no expectations, if you go.<//Review>< pictures>

We sat at a table under full sun and literally baked. They could have provided umbrellas or some kind of shade. The food presentation was not very appealing. It was flavorful but could have been done much better. We've eaten here before, but something has changed. It just wasn't as good as we've had in the past.<//text>

Steak was very peppery and, although I like a medium rare, to rare steak, mine was barely cooked at all. Plus they gave me the wrong drink. Probs just a bad night, but for us, who don't get a lot of us time...it was really disappointing. Normally our favorite place.< /review>

<Review>The food was good, the service was great. Tried chili's first they said 15 min to sit, then when they called our name they said 15 to 25 mins to get a server. We left, and went to outback. It was much better,  got right in, and ordered immediately. I will be back.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>The food was prepared perfectly and the margarita was wonderful. But, the service from our server, Kathleen, was absolutely extraordinary. She is one of the most attentive servers that I have ever had. Kudos to Kathleen because of who I will definitely return to Outback. Thanks to her for the fantastic work.</Text>< Response>

I used to dog this place but it has killer steaks! Who would've thought? Some menu options are like you're typical chain restaurant, but there's def some treasures. Prime rib, awesome. House salad w ranch, awesome. Coconut shrimp and wings deserve mentions, would be better if they were cheaper tho. Happy hour is just half portions for half the money, except for big beers are LEGIT $1 off!</review>

The service was very helpful and observant. Bring your appetite because portions are large. Mood here reminds me of Colorado Springs area.</Text>

<Review>The Queensland chicken and shrimp pasta was decent. My friend ordered Aussie cheese fries and steakhouse quesadillas and they're both pretty good! I actually enjoyed the quesadillas a lot! It was just right amount of meat and cheese in it and the portion was just right! Our server was nice, but I have had better servers at different locations od outback steakhouse. That's why I give it a three star. Overall still a good experience.< /Review><Date>1514156526446<//Date><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4ZtgnRwYH00vEGEDIz9R-qjHVPSIT0LND9Rzb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOHhCyebsJg92I_1xsM5U7APJMBb-9ntNg7wNE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

Service was great at this location compared to the one we usually go to in carlsbad, very attentive and easy going. We came for my husbands birthday for lunch. Ribeye steak was perfect and tender. I orderd the pasta with shrimp and chicken breast. Wow the chicken breast was extremely tender and juicy. The best chicken breast of my life seriously. The shrimp was dee- ishiously well seasoned. Wings and the bleu cheese dressing were mouth watering. The seasoning is great but maybe too much for those who eat very bland. But personally i loved it!< /text>

Food was just ok, but for the price I expected more than wilted salad and over cooked meat. They didn’t even have the kids coloring menus, which are my kids favorite part of going to Outback restaurants. However, the service was beyond good. Our server, Daniel, was attentive and great. I just feel the people in the kitchen are the ones dropping the ball.< /Text>

<Review>Don’t waste your time coming here, the steaks are blend and they don’t even offer the Mac n cheese. It’s beyond me how they use 17 different seasonings and the steak is still tasteless. I payed $27 for a tasteless steak don’t waste your money or time. I’m from Az and the ones out there would never serve such a disappointment< /Review>< username>

<Text>I was trying to reach this outback (Clairemont mesa) over the phone for a takeout order since 8:30pm.  I was placed on Hold for over 15 minutes.  I called back to see if that did the trick and finally someone picked up to tell me their kitchen had just closed.  From looking at their website I can see they are supposed to be open until 9:00pm.  It should not take someone over 20 mins to place an order over the phone & then b told sorry you just miss the cut off.  Really unprofessional & it seems this restaurant really doesn’t want people business.<//Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dc00f6090890df:0x79532cd03bc31f72< /Gmap_id></record>

I love outback steakhouse. It's a great place to get a decent steak at a decent price. Whenever I need a steak fix, my choice is almost always this location. I love the staff. Very rarely do I have an issue here. The few times I have had a problem, they were quickly resolved.<//review>

Made with the most delicious parts of the steak, it is served hot and is a great alternative to sandwiches and burgers. I've never been served anything less than excellent, across the menu. My husband and I have been regular patrons in the Clairemont Square restaurant, since it opened years ago.<//Text>< Pics>

Don't worry if it's busy, it is worth the wait. The place has a great feel to it. Ambience is similar to Fresno's scene.<//Text>

Gotta tell you I was disappointed.  I hadn't been to Outback in a minute but I agreed to meet my friends at 9pm. It was a party of 3 and the restaurant was NOT busy at all.  Everyone ordered salads but I gotta tell you it took FOREVER to get our food, which was good, but the service was slow AF.  Idk if we'll give Outback another chance especially because I ended up getting really sick when I got home. Only other thing I ordered was the baked potato soup with no bacon.<//Text>

My favorite Outback in San Diego! Great attentive staff. Delicious tri tip and Brussels sprouts. Also recommend the giant chocolate cake with raspberry sauce..... *Homer drool*

I tip my hat to all the staff and especially the managers. Show's great leadership!< /review>

We went at 11.30 am ..us two gals wanted to sit and chat.  Our server was attentive before and after our food arrived. Food was great and cooked perfect.  My steak was medium and my friends had hers rare with barely warm center.  Just the way we ordered them.  Salads were fresh and I love their Blue Cheese dressing.  Fresh bread right out of the oven.  No complaints about anything.< /Review>

Is it amazing? No, but it's a well-seasoned steak. The prices have gone up over the last couple of years, so for us, it's not really worth it. That said, this location had particularly good service. They were very attentive with everything and pretty quick.< /Review>

<review>I stopped for lunch for the Steak & Ribs deal. I called on the way and asked if they still have the Steak & Ribs deal? The girl on the phone said yes we do so I proceeded to go to Outback. I seated myself and a server soon came by with a menu. I asked about the Steak & Ribs deal since there was nothing on the menu about it and was told oh no we have this one now pointing to something about steak and salmon. I said is that deal over? He said well I don't know if we even have the menu card anymore because everything is getting ready for Mother's Day. But I will check and see if I can get it for you. Bottom line I got Steak & Ribs and a Coke and a water with mashed potatoes and spent $25 . for lunch.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Horrible experience!! Not only were we treated rudely, but the service was horrible. The people who got there AFTER us were waited on, served, ate & left when my date & I had just finished ordering. They took 30 minutes to get our server, another 20 to bring us waters. By the time we had ordered, we were about to go next door to eat instead, but my being pregnant and with cravings took the best of me. We were there for almost 3 hours. Now.. all that into consideration.. let add this. My date and I, hispanics. The people whom i mentioned before, white! So, however the situation may be interpreted, I saw something I hadn't seen in a long time. Descrimination. A person knows when it's being done. And i hope that wasn't the case. But they made me feel so small, and unimportant. So, basically, don't go eat here. I know I won't ever again step foot here again.< /review>< user_id>

Solid service Everytime we go. Food is tasty, never disappointing and nice quality for the price. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is because the last two times I've gone my steak has been over cooked. Asked for medium and got well done, twice.</review>

I do like this place - the service is good and it has a friendly atmosphere.  It could be so much better if the steaks, especially the Prime Rib were more tender.  Granted, 27$ is not much for prime rib nowadays, but it is a lot for a tough piece of meat.  Everything else, IMHO, is great, why ruin it with a tough Prime Rib.  For most of us, this is a special dinner, so I hope Outback Clairemont will take the final leap and make this a great dinner. They have so much to offer - I hope they can do it.  They may be a chain restaurant, but are they chained to a certain meat supplier who cannot deliver quality meat? Please make the changes you need to be the great restaurant you could be.  So much care goes into your other items - can't you find a better meat supplier? I sure hope so!
A loyal customer who deserves better.

A very decent steak. They're specials and happy hours are way easier on the wallet. Very fresh veggies and lots of healthy options when you're really looking.
If I'm indulging I have the coconut shrimp the sauce they serve is like orange marmalade.</Text>

Food order was taken incorrectly, asked for medium rare received well done and asked for loaded mash and received regular mash. After an attempt to fix I got fully rare (I could still hear it mooing). Asked for a refill of Sprite and got a water. Definitely will not be coming back to this location and I do not recommend anyone else coming here neither.< /review>

Good service, my waiter was Daniel. He was an excellent waiter. Kept our drinks filled up, asked if we needed anything. Food came out pretty fast. Five stars.</review>

<review>Today tuesday january 28 @ 7:35pm, Server was good, food was good. But at the end the experience and service they ripped it off so bad when I tried pay the hostessA send me with the bartender, when I get with the bartender and I tried give the money he just said (rude, arrogant and loud ) " give it to the server !!

Then I went back with the hostessA and the she called the other hostessB
now, the hostessB call the manager and finally the manager took the money and I got my change back.

Before you hire a hostess make sure she is a thinker (criteria) and knows the basic basic basic step.

And your busser or dishwasher I bet they have so much better customer service than the bartender.</review>< pics>

<Review>Fantabulous to say the least! The filet mignon was scrumptious and everything else was absolute perfection. The manager was on his toes and was very accommodating. Our server did an excellent job as well. Visiting San Diego for the first time, Outback proved to be an outstanding choice as everything else as delicious and very satisfying.</Review>< pics>

The first time we came we got excellent service and great food, even in the middle of the dinner crowd! The second time was even better. My mom got the prime rib, and some people know that some Outbacks can be a little too harsh to the steaks, this one was PERFECT. Definitely 10/10 would come again.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I wouldn't call it lively, but its where I go for a Prime Minister's prime rib, I get the largest cut. Au Jus is on point, bread is amazing. Blooming Onion is 1800 calories, so pass on that. Sherry mushrooms are amazing. Caesar salad is really good too. Lots of families. Dark in side. Courteous servers.<//Text>

Service was pleasant and quick, but the food has changed. I can't describe how, but it's not quite what it was a year ago. Kind of tasteless. Could've been me, I'm sure. Maybe I was just having an off night in the taste buds department.< /Review>

We went in, sat down, waited a few minutes. No server came to help us so we hit the button to call the server. We waited 10 minutes and no one came to serve us or take drink orders so we got up and left. Terrible service. The place wasn't even crowded.< /review>

We come here because the kids like the cheese fries. Otherwise I'd stop coming. The food is certainly acceptable and pretty much the same as any other Outback. But the service is consistently bad. Our drinks always take a super long time to come out, then stay empty for 15-20 minutes. Apps come a minute before the entrees. Last time they didn't bring us bread. And don't get me started on the all you can eat shrimp. The fact that it's all you can eat relies on your server coming by more than once every 30 minutes.<//review>

Steak was overcooked, was supposed to be the large choice, but was small like a child's size  with shrimp but came with lobster the size of a crawdad and had no flavor, came with white fake drawn butter instead of regular yellow butter. I complained and they they added 4 miniature shrimp on a stick overloaded with pepper. My wife's coconut shrimp was fine. Won't go back to the Clairemont Outback. The waiter was confused and did not take responsibility for the order mixup. Bad experience on our 51st anniversary. Ugh. Rich<//text>

Casual dinning. There is something for everyone on the menu.  Moderately priced. The staff is friendly and attentive.  Nice place for a  casual dinner. Ask about their dinners club.  You get a free dinner every 4th visit.  They offer military discounts and AARP discounts.< /review>

<Text>Most Outbacks me and my family have been to have been either mediocre or bad, with the exception of the Woodbury, MN location(Why did it have to close?!?). This location was completely different. We were on vacation in 2016 and we came here, everyone's food was excellent. It was so good in fact, that we came back 2 days later, and it was even better then! My mother ordered the Prime Rib(which can be a gamble) and it was perfect. If I were ever in San Diego again, I would definitely come back.</Text>< pics>

I will not eat here again until they get rid of the screens at the tables that cannot be turned off. Last time I went I could see at least 7 screens flashing and some of the content on the screens were advertisements. I don't want pay 30 dollars for a steak dinner to be bombarded with bright screens that are advertising things that are not related to the restaurant.

Also when it was time to pay the check the waitress made my 73 year old mother use the screen to pay even after I asked for a paper copy of the check. She had a hard time using the machine which was not a nice way to end a expensive meal<//text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Quite disappointed by that place even though I did not come there with high expectations based on reviews and how the building looks like.

The food is OK, but not great. I think they always overcook a bit (I asked rare and got medium, my girlfriend asked medium and got well done...). Considering the price, I feel it is a bit pricey for what you got.

As for the service, definitely not good. After we got served, we never saw the waiter again (even for checkout and we ended up self checkout hopefully...). My girlfriend got seated on a dirty seat. She notified it and only got towels to clean it by herself.

So basically, you pay the price of a good steakhouse for an ok food and poor quality of service.

I dont plan to come back again.</text><rating>2<//rating><resp>None< /resp>< user>

<text>Wanted to enjoy the All You Can Eat Shrimp with Steak night.......found out it's all you can eat shrimp only if they actually serve you the shrimp. Ordered the extra shrimp as soon as the dinner was served. It didn't show up until after we were finished eating.  This was only one of the problems we had at this Outback. Took forever to be served, food came out moderately warm which was disappointing. During the meal no one checked on us. Ended up going to the bar to get another beer. BTW the place was half full and looked like plenty of wait-staff.<//text><userid>108254528950796178584<//userid><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Food was good.  Outback is very consistent.  Place was full at 7PM and service was confused and inconsistent.  The use of table kiosks seems to have dampened the servers enthusiasm for personal service.  Manager oblivious.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dc00f6090890df:0x79532cd03bc31f72<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Most Outbacks me and my family have been to have been either mediocre or bad, with the exception of the Woodbury, MN location(Why did it have to close?!?). This location was completely different. We were on vacation in 2016 and we came here, everyone's food was excellent. It was so good in fact, that we came back 2 days later, and it was even better then! My mother ordered the Prime Rib(which can be a gamble) and it was perfect. If I were ever in San Diego again, I would definitely come back.< /text>

<review>Service is generally good, food is generally good, but if you're facing the front of the restaurant in the afternoon, be prepared to have the sun in your face during dining. No blinds either so don't bother asking them to close them.<//review>< user_id>

< Review>
Sat down at the tables in the bar area. I watched several employees walk by without anyone acknowledging we were there. After seven minutes my daughter and I left, probably never to return to this location again. My daughter and I have attended this location at least 25 times. Sometimes they are short handed, it happens. But when at least 5 servers walk by without acknowledgment it’s time to go elsewhere and get the service I expect. What happened to Outback?<//Review>

<review>Sadly we did not have a good experience at this restaurant. The waiter was very nice but the steak that was ordered had to be returned because it was burnt. They called it seared I call it burnt. Burnt meat will cause colon cancer.  This meal was served to a retired doctor. They did bring another steak but was unable to eat because it was dry. Don’t think we’ll be retuning.</review>< UserId.>

Don't go to this Outback. Rubber steak, undercooked potatoes,  canned soup, warm salad. Outback is a family staple for us, this location is badly managed.  I do NOT recommend at all.</Review>

A bit disappointed. We had always wanted to go there so we waited ' a long time' for our food. Well, the waitress forgot our order and when we got it, the steak was tough and lacking in flavor, the salad was not cool. It seems that it may have been just a bad day for them.</Text>

Carside service, missing items, called to complain, was put to a voice mail, I'm still awaiting a call. 18 hours later, so I called back. The girl at the other end transferred me back to the order line and I was hung up on. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! The steak was ok, but not worth the hassle.< /Review>

Overly priced for extremely salty food. .i ordered the french onion  soup and it was so generic and salty that I'm actually surprised i didn't stroke out in the parking lot...my husband ordered ribs and they tasted like a roast, and were just as dry..my daughtervirdered the sesame salad with ahi and it was decent...paid almost 80 bucks with tip. So not worth it.< /text>

<Review>(Un)limited Shrimp

Was persuaded to pay extra for their unlimited shrimp option. Big mistake. Plate they serve you with your meal is a good size - after that it's like you're a criminal or something. Tiny little bowls with two or three shrimp, swimming in oil. Terrible. Asked for larger bowl, asked for less oil: wouldn't do either. Finally gave up. Shame the steak was tough too...< /Review><Rating>1< /Rating><Name>Alexander Robert<//Name>< Response>

Was greeted with a smile I soon as I walked in. Seated immediately, and the ambience was not loud and over bearing. Food came out at a good time afree ordering and the staff was friendly.</Review>

Have been dining there for several time including birthday celebration. Pricey yet high quality foods. Service is average. The french onion soup was too salty.
Fyi, this located inside shopping center that has krispy kreme (behind), 99 cents store, big lots and Vons.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Great and traditional meat restaurant !!!
The Australian network is spread across the world, but the menus have some differences between countries.
In the United States of America, you may choose to have shrimp at will to accompany any dish for just $ 9.99.
There are two types of shrimp (breaded and grilled in butter) that can be ordered while the hunger lasts! Worth it !

Ótimo e tradicional restaurante de carnes !!!
A rede Australiana está espalhada pelo mundo, mas os cardápios tem algumas diferenças entre os países.
Nos Estados Unidos da América, é possível que você opte por camarão à vontade para acompanhar algum prato por apenas U$9,99.
São dois tipos de camarão (empanado e grelhado na manteiga) que podem ser pedidos enquanto durar a fome ! Vale a pena !< /review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) We did not know this line of steakhouses with Australian dishes. We ate well and it is a little more expensive than the average of the genre.
