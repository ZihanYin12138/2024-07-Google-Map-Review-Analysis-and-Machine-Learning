They said it would be fine. When I got there, there were 3 people in a piercing booth behind the desk. No one acknowledged me for more than 5 minutes so I left.

{'time': 1583218991125, 'text': 'Hello Rebecca,\nI’m sorry you weren’t acknowledged when you walked in. That would be me in the piercing booth and sounds like I was piercing. I still try and keep an eye out for people coming in but sometimes I miss clients when they come in. Typically you can always walk in and get a piercing within 10 to 20 min max and that’s why we say just come on in.  Not sure if someone who wasn’t busy didn’t say hi or acknowledge you and if so that’s not how we like to treat or clients.\n\nHope you give us another shot.\n\nThanks Ryan\nEC Tattoo'}</resp>

She is absolutely fabulous.  I know it seems like an odd place to get a facial but she is extremely skilled and with your facial you get product to take home to use for a month.  She also did my microblading with shading and also does lashes. Can't recommend her enough.< /review>< Resp>

<date>1572066522297< /date><rate>1<//rate><Text>Got a tattoo with my daughter a few weeks ago and instead of using creams during healing process I was instructed to use a plastic wrap that should stay on for 5 days and all is healed. The problem is my skin is now permanently scarred!!!! I was upset and after a couple weeks contacted the shop to ask for a refund.. nothing I can do about my skin; it’s permanently scarred so I thought I should at least get my money back. Talked to someone who said they could help since manager wasn’t available but then tried to tell me about getting a cream to clear up... no cream can clear up a scar that being said he told me the manager would be in contact with me. No call ever came... what kind of business finds out a customer was scarred and does not return a customer call??? A bad one.. I have 6 tattoos. Not a lot but enough to know being scarred isn’t part of the process .. use this shop at your own risk< /Text>< pics>

Unfortunately I got the message a couple days later as you called on a day off of mine. But I tried calling the number on the note and it didn’t work so I’m guessing the person who took the note wrote it down wrong. I was hoping you would call back but didn’t here back from you. I’m sorry you felt we just abandoned you not caring. If you can email me at Ectattoosd@gmail.com or give the shop a call again Saturday through Tuesday.\n\nThanks Ryan\nEC Tattoo'}<//Response>

Went in and got my nose pierced as a walk in. Staff was SUPER friendly. Shop was really can and seemed well organized. It's nice seeing shops like this. Makes it pretty welcoming. Only downside is parking but that isn't their fault.<//review>

You should come in and Check out Johnny Vampotna's work. He's a great Tattoo artist and he looks like a Sexual O'Possum, he smells like Cake & Heaven, his blond hair is like a golden wheat field from my childhood memories.I own two of his painting and cherish them more than my first born. His name is Johnny..and he's awesome ( like a O'Possum, remember?)</Text>

I went here to get my industrial done. First I went and talked to Nemo the piercer that day, he said it was impossible for me to get an industrial. A few days later a friend of mine told me to go on the weekend to see the other piercer Kevin, so I did and left with my industrial I wanted. He explained why it would be difficult to pierce but NOT IMPOSSIBLE! its healing up great.< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>This shop has so much going for it if only one of the artist there would get his s**t together. Scheduled an appointment for a $400 piece with Gregory, the day of the appointment I come in and he tells me he accidentally scheduled two people for the same appointment time and asks if I can come back in 2 hours. It wasn't that bad until he tells me 2 hours later that the stencil machine broke and he'd have to push back the appointment a day, which alright it sucked getting flaked on twice but it wasn't the end of the world. Finally got my $400 piece done, with $250 taken off and $150 towards my next piece since he kept flaking.

The next appointment with $150 was scheduled a month later, come around that time, I text Gregory asking when our next session would be. He's here being shady not giving me clear dates for our next appointment, saying he'd text me back cause he's busy but never does, and at one point stopped replying at all. I'm writing this with plans of going in and getting my $150 back. Totally unprofessional, the other artists here (Smallz, etc) are chill and professional, GREGORY IS NOT. DO *NOT* CONSULT HIM FOR ANYTHING. Save yourself the trouble and go to someone who's actually corteous and professional.</Text>< Pictures>

The ramen here is amazing. It was very comforting with very rich delicious broth. When I finished my bowl I just sat there in admiration. It was a masterpiece. My family loved it and we will definitely come back soon.< /Review>

<review>this isn't your traditional ramen place, they got their own special flavor. the price is starting to be on the higher end $20-25 per person. i personally like it a lot because they're opened throughout the day and late as well for delivery.< /review>< pics>

This is my favorite restaurant in all of Los Angeles. I love sitting at the bar if I go by myself.

They have a cute little side room for groups and I guess it’s like.... a hot stove to cook meats? (I don’t know, I don’t eat meat, but it’s so adorable)

I see other comments saying it’s small, but honestly if you’re seated, it’s doesn’t feel like that.

There’s booths for larger groups, tables for couples, and the bar to sit at.

I really never eat out or buy food out, but when I do this is really the only place I go to.

I always get the vegetarian ramen. There’s an excellent portion of noodles in the soup, as well as broth.

I love how every component of this dish has so much detail. The mushrooms and cabbage in the soup have both been separately prepared in a different flavor from everything else in the soup. I love how there’s so many different flavor components.

Also, I always add tofu and seaweed to my soup.
I don’t know what type of tofu y’all use or if you make it fresh, but it’s SOOOOOO fresh and delicious.

Customer service is always excellent and friendly. I can tell they care genuinely how I’m doing or if I need anything and always make a point to have a conversation with me outside of just “what can I get for you?” It’s nice to be in a humble environment with such delicious food.<//review>

<Date>1559220884274< /Date><rate>4<//rate><review>Located off Carson in Torrance. Small parking lot shared with other businesses during the day time parking will probably be tight after the other businesses close parking would be better. The place is small they have a big table in the middle to accommodate a big party and a couple of booths along the side and a few rooms to sit Japanese style where you take your shoes off. The staff was friendly and service was pretty fast. I wasn't hungry for ramen so I just got some edamame. Our server was very attentive and apologized for either missing something or taking long for anything I think he was overwhelmed with the big table party but he was cool and took care of us. Overall a nice spot for a late ramen craving. I'd go back for ramen.<//review>< pictures>

Drinks are expensive a can of soda is about $2.35 or so but their noodles are great for their price I ordered a $12 bowl which are pretty big bowls and the taste is amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to any ramen lovers! They also had a $1.99 draft Sapporo beer for happy hour! Spicy Miso Ramen is my favorite! Very delicious and creamy.<//text>

The ramen broth was tasty! I ordered the spicy miso ramen and it was the right amount of spicy. Let's just say I came in with my nose stuffed up and I left being able to breathe.

<Review>Used to come here alot, recently went right after work with a coworker and it was great. However, I'm not a fan or a lot of fat on my meat as I noticed the meat was mostly fat now,  I remember the meat having a little bit of fat on  the side but now it's like they give you a whole slice of fat. Don't know if I'll be coming back and time soon or if I do I'll ask for no meat because I'm not going to pay extra for a piece of fat.<//Review>< gmapID>

Got a spicy Ramen
Was not the quality I got previously.
Was so bad I wont be back
Broth was brown and tasted burnt
Was terrible
I called to complain never called me back
Broth is usually good I wasted like 16 $ that's alot to just throw away the food I was going to have for dinner.<//Text>

<Review>Worked here for about a year I believe and I never got tired of the house ramen or the appetizers. I still go eat every now and then even though I don’t work there anymore. Gyozas are a must!! Really love the chashu bowl with extra sauce and a flavored egg. The staff is really friendly and the private booths are where it’s at.<//Review>< Pictures>

When I want ramen I look for authenticity & believe me this place fits the criteria. I love Tonkatsu ramen, but something about the Spicy Miso caught my attention, best decision I've made. The broth just drowns ur tongue of various flavors, extra chashu is a must. The noodles are a little different than the Tonkatsu's but much better. I only wish I could fit more in my stomach.< /Review>

Staff is very friendly and they have different types of seating but is a bit of a wait if you come during peak hours. Another great thing is that it's open late so if you're looking for a late night meal, I would recommend this place as well!!< /Review><time>1531063353542<//time><GmapID>0x80dd4aa384884dd7:0x15c0e2370a4e342a<//GmapID>< response>

Great vibe. They have private booths for up to 4 that have a 90min time limit. There are little hooks to hang your stuff on the wall. I dont remember if there was music but we had a regular volume conversation. The gyoza was one of the best I've eaten, the Zabon Chasu ramen was ok and the cold sake was good. Customer service was excellent.  We didnt have to wait to get our bill.< /text>

Great customer service. The wait staff really knew their menu. I read the other reviews and couldn't disagree more with the bad service. Zabon's has a hip young multi racial staff which I found to be a refreshing  change of pace from the usual ramen shops in the South Bay Los Angeles area. Beautiful simple traditional Japanese decor. Spotlessly clean. I ordered the spicy ramen from their lunch menu. Only 8.95$. 2.00-3.00$ less than a bowl of ramen in the same area. The broth was a bit on the salty side for me. Portion size and soup temperature on point. Fast service.<//Text>

<text>Love it! Always quick to seat. Delicious ramen. They have thick and thin noodles so if it matters to you that your noodle is thicker then get the Miso! The staff is also great. They have booths and small tables and a bar area. They're also open late! Follow them on IG for 10% off your 1st visit (within 4 weeks).<//text></record>

Love this place, Its usually here or jidaiya in the torrance area.
Pork based broth with a slight undertaste of fish based broth(People who don't like fish, don't let it deter you, you probably wont even notice it).
Couldn't tell you what kind though.
Solid flavor strength, ask for it extra strong if you like, they will do it.
Chashu is soft and juicy.<//Text>

Good Ramen but a little too much salt in the sauce.  I had the curry and wife had traditional ramen.  Both salty.  Prices are higher than average.   But we will go back again.< /text>

<text>While looking for late night dining, we found this place, it was a pleasant surprise. We ordered just about everything on the menu and liked everything we ordered. Shishito pepper appetizer was perfectly done and fried rice was flavorful. I had spicy chachu ramen, it was packed with flavor from the bone broth, smoky pepper, and roasted onion bits. The noodles were thin, not my favorite kind, but it was commendable.</text>< Pictures>

First time here and loved it. The ramen was on point. I got the spicy ramen with habanero paste and Damn it was 🔥🔥🔥 i usually don't finish the broth but it was so so good that i finished every last bit. The happy hour is awesome and everyday of the week. The server was so sweet and helpful and just loved her thick accent. Will be returning soon thank you guys<//review>

This is your typical Japanese ramen shop: a few tables, a mini bar, and a few booths.

There is a large room on the left upon entering, and is normally occupied. I can say the same towards the booths (towards the right, window view of Carson St) but not as frequent compared to the former.

Service is fantastic, the servers check on you from time to time, unlike other places where they just seat you and, well, good luck getting service!

I get the usual [will update this later of the specific order when I visit again as well as include a picture of the menu(s) for your convenience].

If you're not familiar with Japanese cuisine, the portions are VERY SMALL compared to American cuisine, so don't be surprised if you order anything that ISN'T ramen and find that it looks rather skimpy.

I don't know if they have a customer-usable restroom as I never asked (will add on next visit).

I always come back for the spontaneous ramen cravings!!!<//Review>

HIGHLY recommend the veggie ramen.
Even if you are on the pro meat team like me the veggie ramen is a must try.

It is extremely  flavorful and is probably one of my all-time favorite ramen dishes.

I normaly add Yuzu pepper. Which gives it more of a citrus than spicy flare.

Cost a little extra but so worth it< /text>< pics>

This place definitely improved since grand opening in terms of service and ramen ! They taste so much better and their appetizers are a definite must to try. Service is better and I've been to zabon about 5 times already. The ramen I get has more flavor and less salty now. You get a good amount of food. They really do try hard to be efficient and care about each customer. I believe the managers are only present here, and they're English is a bit broken so that probably came off as "rude" to some customers, the way they may speak to them. You're always greeted when you come and and when you leave the restaurant.< /Text>

Came here because my cousin said it was good so I just had to try it out. Its a fair sized place with i believe 2 enclosed tables, we sat in one of them. It's both a pro and con because yes its enclosed but it made it easy to forget we were there. Also being busy made it easy to forget us since our table wasn't in eye sight. Service could have been a tad better but it was still good. My waitress stayed helpful and positive which is always great. Now as far as food goes I had the takoyaki and small curry rice to start, both of which were great delicious starters. My main course was their spicy miso ramen but I had to add flavored egg and seaweed since I love having both in all my ramen. Be aware that the spicy miso ramen doesn't come with egg already. Almost every other ramen spot I have been to has it already included in the ramen so that was different. The seaweed however wasn't how I prefer seaweed on my ramen. This place had it chopped up and it was moist served on the side. Other spots serve it dried and in 1 or 2 large pieces inside the ramen; that's how I prefer it. Overall the ramen was great and filling. I wish I could try it with sake and dessert but I'll save that for next time. I do recommend this place and I will return for another time.<//Text>

The place is a bit small but it's still good. They have one room with the traditional tables where in you have to remove your shoes. The service was good and they were accommodating. The ramen was alright. It wasnt the best but it was still good. I ordered the chashu ramen and a chashu bowl. The chashu bowl was also alright. I believe the chashu pork was cooked a bit differently than usual.<//Review>

The noodles are good and the chashu is tender, but the tonkotsu broth is a little saltier than I prefer. The service is kind, but pretty standard.< /Text>

Service was excellent, attentive, warm and welcoming. The food was good. I thought the Ramen broth was very rich and flavorful. I ordered the Chashu Ramen and it was well rounded. Generous amount for Pork Chashu. The ramen noodles was thinner, but it was perfectly cooked, not too soft, just right amount, overall well rounded bowl of ramen.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) We are doing it until late and are saved. Ramen tastes good and there are many other menus. The clerk feels good too.

<Review>(Translated by Google) I ate Spicy Zabon Ramen.It was great taste for me.
It is a spicy spicy dish (sansho?) And a distinctive dish.
There are various types of common ramen around here, so I want you to continue the characteristic taste.
I want to eat another kind this time.

I ate Spicy Zabon Ramen. It was great taste for me.
麻辣的な辛さ（山椒？）であり、特徴的な一品。
一般的なラーメンはこの周辺にはいろいろあるので、このまま特徴的な味を継続して欲しい。
別の種類を今度は食べてみたい。< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

(Translated by Google) Although it is written as Kagoshima ramen, there are variations such as miso ramen and boiled soup ramen. It also makes the noodles harder.
During the happy hour, beer and snacks are reasonably priced and reasonably priced, so it's easy for one person to enter.

鹿児島ラーメンと書いていますが、味噌ラーメンや煮干しスープのラーメン等バリエーションはあります。麺硬めもしてくれます。
ハッピーアワーの時間内ならビールとおつまみがお手頃サイズかつ手頃な値段で、一人でも入りやすいお店です。<//review>

I asked for no ice, you 3/4 cup.  Might as well get ice...I paid for a full size drink but get a partial cup...unbelievable!! Drink variety is not all that great either.  I won't recommend  to my friends or family to come.<//Review>

Cute little store. Many choices of drink. We tried green Thai tea (less sugar) and it was pretty good. The combo pandan waffle with ice cream was delish. Pretty good price too. Recommend!<//review>

<rating>4</rating><text>I was feeling the urge to have milk tea and found Passion near my work. I'm so glad that I went there because the Jasmine milk tea was so delicious. I went there around 3 on a weekday and there was no wait and nobody there.

I ordered 2 large. 1 in the cute plastic bottle but as you can see in the picture - It is smaller than the large cup size.

Tip: Buying the plastic bottle is not worth it unless you buy it separately and get the milk tea in the regular plastic cup. Otherwise, I would give them 5 stars.

I would definitely go again and possibly give Passion 5 stars.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSFLSK-97To4WiWvHKdwGHCgv7EBMuXV8iruqY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<text>As I have heard a few times, the best dessert place. This place is small and quaint. However, service is quick and if you can get a table, it's really cozy for an afternoon. I love the atmosphere and love coming back here.Look forward to coming back again very soon with my son.</text>< Pics>

This place has a little bit of everything for everyone.  You can get your fancy roll up ice cream made to order, or just a simple customized tea.  They also have tons of fried snacks like your popcorn Chicken or squid balls. There are TVs playing with loud music to keep the place lively!< /review>

Tried the very popular Hawaiian sunset from yelp recommendations... It was not very good at all to me. I thought had fallen into some sort of running gag where everyone tries to make you believe it's good just because it is so bad.

Maybe this was just me being unlucky, but I tried my friend's Hawaiian sunset and it was pretty much just as bad.

I liked the cozy place. It seemed nice. I will hopefully give this place another shot in the future, but for now  I can't highly recommend this place.<//text>

The drinks were alright. The food was pretty dry. They give discounts. They have roll ice cream which is pretty loud. This is also a party atmosphere.<//text>

Nice place to chill and get tea at. Originally my brother and I came to get their bingsu, but the person who makes it wasn't around and would arrive later :(. We ended up getting some of their teas which were pretty good and refreshing. I will have to come back for their bingsu another time<//Text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>We came here because of the cute reusable bottles they were offering, but they didn't have the same ones. So, it was empty when we entered. It was dim in the place because the lights weren't on, but there was music playing. The cashier didn't suggest any popular drinks they had while we were standing there deciding. She was awkwardly standing there and staring.

So, eventually we placed our order and sat down. Looking around at the walls and the decor it was similar to Tea Society, but more on the simple, and plain Jane side. The floors were not mopped with a clean mop. You can see the dark grey/black streaks of the mop. Very yucky. They didn't clean up the yogurt toppings area, maybe even didn't cover it up either. The spoons were not removed toppings were around the counter.

While looking outside a young man got out of his car to remove the cone they had placed there to "reserve" parking to park. He backed his car up and parked. Came inside to retrieve a dolly for seven big bags of ice. We were observing and trying to see how bags of ice was in his trunk, it was deep and we first assumed there were only to and my step-daughter commented, "Really? He couldn't carry that one bag, wait two bags of ice?" Then I saud, "Wait... there might be more." Low and behold there surely was more! Anyhow, so we get our drinks after a long and left. So did the young man dropping off the bags of ice. Once he moved his car he put the cone back.

Does that mean the cones are there for the employees to park only? Usually they reserve it for the patrons right? I don't get it.

Anyhow, cleanliness was not good nor the service. Wait time was much longer than most places and they weren't even busy. I wouldn't recommend this spot after trying it out once,< /text>< pictures>

<Review>It's close to my work. The teas are decent but can be inconsistent in quality every now and then. The 4 start is definitely for the customer service. They really try to accommodate the clients request. The menu is smaller but still have good options.< /Review>< pics>

Great place to have that specialty tea. Highly recommend the mangonada smoothie. My first choice for teas is the oolong peach, the earl grey milk teas, and their underrated jasmine milk teas. The owner takes great care providing quality teas. Trust me, she's working in the back making sure your tea is exactly made how you like it. I highly recommend this tea joint than any others.  I used to go to other tea shoppes before but none matches the creativity of this place.

Update: the owner has a "secret menu" haha...if I knew what they are. Well, the matcha milk tea is very refreshing on a hot summer's day.

Update no. 2: the owner came up with new drink specialties. Fruit teas infused by lychee jelly bits, peach oolong tea. Recently her snack menu has undergone changes. Passion T now selling Asian Fusion snacks! Whenever you see Moo on the menu (for instance mac and moo) it is filet mignon meat stir fried in vegetables and  macaroni noodles! I tried the moo egg rolls, AWESOME! The owner came up with what I think to be superb fish sauce chicken wings! Don't be fooled, it is fried chicken wings and it does not come with sauce. You have to request and I suggest sriracha! 5 stars on the Asian Fusion.  They're open for Christmas and I know where I'll be. I guess traditional Christmas food will have competition? Lol!😀

Anyway, Passion T does not disappoint. Enjoy the nice, easygoing atmosphere or ambiance.

Updated:  Sometime in April 2020, in the beginning of the pandemic, the store changed management. Sure the menu is still there, with additional menu items that the new owner added. Though i've only been there four times ever since, it wouldn't be fair for me to say if things had gotten better. Or not.<//review>

<text>Came here with a friend to try the place out. My go to drink is the wintermelon black tea drink with boba ($3.85) because not all places carry it.  We also got the popcorn chicken and chicken gizzard. I've been told that the San Jose area has excellent tea drinks and the caveat is,  I'll be comparing it to my go to place in NYC.

Wintermelon black tea with boba ($3.85) - the wintermelon flavor was okay, I thought a little muted. Similar with the tea. Not as strong as I thought it would be. I don't know in detail how their teas are made or what type of tea leaves they use or how long they brew it for but either my taste buds are dying or it's a little tamed. I guess one good thing is that it wasn't overly sweet.

Overall, their boba is spot on. It's soft, chewy, not hard, and it hasn't been sitting around for awhile. I thought the boba was still slightly warm after immediately trying upon receiving the drink. If I only had the boba itself, it would have been a 4* review. I know of other places where they do more stuff to the boba to more or less enhance or compliment the teas. Of course that's extra ingredients/overhead but that's part of business decision/planning. If all other stores are not as good as this store, no need to change your model. But there is room for improvement.

As for the foods, I thought they were fine. I don't think you come to an establishment like this for their food. It's rare for these places to serve food that is better than their drinks. Since their main focus are drinks and desserts, there is a lesser weighting factor from the foods. One unique thing about this place is chicken gizzard. You definitely don't see that often and it's very catered to a certain type of population. I think it makes them a little unique.

For now, I'm going to keep my options open and will definitely come back here to try their Earl Gray. I think that's another tea drink that takes a little care and finesse to get it right.</text><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>109028906014708659267<//UserId.>< Pics>

We love our fence! We live at a corner lot and needed a privacy fence for the side yard. We decided to do a privacy fence with aluminum on one side. They came and installed quickly and efficiently. I cannot tell you how many compliments we have received from the neighborhood. I have even had people ask if they could take pictures so they could get the same style in their yard. Cannot give enough compliments  to MANDA Gates And Fences!< /review>

<Text>Moses came out to do my estimate the day after I contacted him. His crew was quiet, polite and clean. There was a slight miscommunication about our gate but once we pointed out the mistake it was fixed quickly and cheerfully. And, the finished fence looks great, with fantastic attention to detail. The crew even replaced a board that was much darker than the rest of them. Finally, the invoice is the same as what was estimated. Can't ask for better! Well done. I will be happy to refer you to my friends.</Text>< pictures>

Portions of our fence had fallen over the winter. I requested a quote from MANDA on and received a call from Moses a couple hours later. He was able to come out to the house the same day to provide an estimate. His estimate fell in the middle of the four companies who contacted me.
My neighbour and I felt comfortable moving forward with Moses and he was able to do the work the very next week. He even emailed us our own respective contracts. His crew was punctual and polite, and completed the job as promised.< /text>

<Review>I highly recommend this company for those looking for a quality fence and a super professional team. They put up a 6ft privacy fence to replace my janky chain link one. They were easy to get a hold of, provided great service, and worked efficiently. One of the reasons I chose them for my home project was the great customer service they provided. I called different fence companies for a quote and others were curt and unhelpful. MANDA Gates And Fences provided stellar and timely customer service. If you want a high quality fence, choose MANDA for sure.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Very conscientious , friendly, looking for ways to reduce costs when estimating. Removal done swiftly and cleanly. Workmanship very good. They had to go out to buy more wood when some of what was delivered was unsatisfactory. Will hire them for remainder of fencing in years to come.</Text>

Excellent work!  Our fence is beautiful.  They were punctual, the workers were considerate, had a great rapport with each other, got the job done efficiently, and cleaned up afterward.  I'm only sorry that I didn't use them for my other fence a few months ago.  They also fixed that other guy's work on the gate!  Stellar!<//review>

<text>Working with MANDA Gates And Fences was great! The owner came by same-day to provide a quote on the spot. When we kicked off the project he was able to come by later that week. His crew did an incredible job removing and installing a new wooden fence and finished the project in one day! I was so pleased that everything moved ahead quickly. The fence looks excellent and I'd highly recommend them!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Moses and his team were very responsive. We got quotes from three different companies, Moses' price was not the lowest or highest, but the advantage was they were able to start much sooner than other companies proposed. The installation process was smooth with no issues. The final result was great. It gave new vibes to our house. Great job!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>There are multiple reasons we highly recommend Manda Gate and Fence Company. Avi, the project coordinator, was patient, respectful, attentive and responsive throughout the decision making and entire construction process. Replacing the gate and fence on our complex and challenging site required a great deal of professional skill. The crew, specifically Eric, Michael and Chris, took great care to complete the installation as we had hoped and expected. This is a service oriented company that does excellent work.< /Text><name>Wendy Edlen< /name><Pics>None</Pics><user>101493084892655994115<//user>< Rating>

Moses and his team is the best! Very prompted and detailed work. We got our fence in 4 days!  We met with Igor for a quote and we got the response right next day. We got started on the project right in the same week. His team is very self sufficient. I would recommend them to anyone!</text>

We recently hired MANDA Gates And Fences for a big fence replacement job and could not be happier! The entire process was exceptional; Our sales rep was quick to respond, showed up on time, was polite, made great suggestions and we received the quote the same day.  The crew was kind, quick and their work was top notch. I would highly recommend this company!< /Text>

<Text>MANDA Gates And Fences is an honest company that stands behind their work.  I was very impressed with their ability to work with us when I pushed to have the work done sooner. They also came back and fixed any issue I had with the work.  The workers were courteous, timely and did their best. We installed a fence to match another one that was already there and a set of stair off of a deck. They did a custom rail to match the old one.  It came out exactly like the old one. I would hire them again in a heartbeat.<//Text>< gmapID>

My interaction with Moses was a positive experience. I reached out for an estimate for a fix after a car hit our fence. He was prompt and detailed in his response and provided a very well priced fix with an explanation of the work to be done. Had our neighbor not got his nephew to fix the issue, we would have 100% gone with Moses.</text>

Had a replacement fence installed last week and we couldn't be happier. The installation crew was punctual. They were very careful of the garden plantings which were up against the old fence. The crew was very professional and polite and the job came out great. A good experience.</review>

Moses, the owner, answered my very first call. He came to look at the property, took very thorough measurements and worked with us patiently on some confusing survey lines. True to his word, three weeks later, the supplies had arrived and his crew worked tirelessly, professionally, with an inordinate amount of attention to detail to complete the job to our specifications. I love how the fence turned out. Could not be any more pleased. Would highly, highly, highly recommend MANDA Gates And Fences!</Review>

This company has been in business for many years and is truly knowledgeable and professional. The staff is friendly and answered all my questions. When the technician came to update and repair the gate, the work was done well. While we often think about repair costs, the technician worked on finding the best solution.< /review>

<Review>These guys are the best! Very professional, efficient, and price is right! Came out and removed our old cedar and replaced with vinyl. Part of the fence was problematic and in a tight area, but his crew took care of it with no problem. The owner is very responsive and attentive to his clients' needs and desires.

<review>This company is top notch! They installed a fence for our dog run, a wroth iron side piece on the side of our house and a custom made iron screen door! They are all beautifully crafted and very well made and installed! They showed up on time, prices were fair, and very reliable. I recommend this company for any of your custom iron needs.</review>< pics>

<Name>Rose Carl</Name>< Review>
The team did an amazing job building our cedar fence. From the initial estimate to the day they finished the project, just an all out excellent experience. They provided a fair price to build a fence in our unique yard with a very steep slope. The rep was super flexible and open during the build out and was understanding to all of our fencing needs. We couldn't be happier with our decision to hire MANDA Gates And Fences. We hope that we get to work with them again in the future when it comes time for some more fencing, and will happily recommend them to others until then</Review>

<Review>Total pros, I highly recommend Manda.  They came for a free consult, had a comprehensive estimate the next day and were a full week ahead of schedule on installation. They do all their fabrication in house so they were flexible on customization and have a lifetime warranty on the code box.  Great experience and will definitely use again.  Thanks Moses!<//Review>< time>

<Review>Amazing. Moses and crew did a fantastic job. They tore out our old fence and put in the new fence over 3 days. The fence is beautiful and very high quality, and they even put it a couple inches into the ground to keep the dog from digging out. The gate is sturdy and perfect. When the rest of our fence needs replacing I will absolutely call them again. With our new fence, the yard is like a whole new yard!< /Review>< Date>

I worked with Moses in planning my fence.  He was attentive and professional.  He understood what I wanted and helped translate into the choices I made before construction.  Moses was enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the details of fence-building.  I would happily work with MANDA Gates And Fences again.  I can't wait to see the actual structure.< /text>

From the quote all the way through the followup from the quality inspectors post-installation, these guys are top notch. We live in a new development with hundreds of houses being built, and have already recommended them to neighbors who are using them as well.

We had our aging fence replaced in the backyard.  Our fences are only 3 ft tall and the original fence was not very pretty. Moses came in and put a decorative fence in and it looks like a piece of art!  They were very neat and came on schedule! I would highly recommend them!  They are now doing my 2 neighbors fences!  Thanks for a job well done.</text>

Very reasonable estimate for my small fencing job, (34 ft of 6 ft high vinyl fencing, plus a 10 ft wide, drive thru gate).  The install crew was very professional and efficient.

Affordable and great looking fence + gate. Easy to work with, very timely, and quality work. Fence install was over 3 days, but that was only because it rained in late afternoon on the second day. But the group worked up until that first raindrop. Much appreciated and great work.< /Text>

MANDA Gates And Fences team installed a new gate and fencing to my side alleyway. They  also installed new supports for existing fences. arrived on time, stuck to the agreed quote and was good fun to have around. The work was completed quickly and the workers were calm and pleasant people. Loved this company.< /review>

Price was fair and the work was done within a week of us reaching out each time. Hopefully I won't need a new fence for a while but if I did I'd call them again.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
The gates in my backyard were falling apart and so I called MANDA Gates And Fences.  Moses and Gal came super quickly, made awesome gates and installed them in less time than they had estimated.  This company exceeded my expectations and my gates look so good!  Everyone I interacted with from this company was super nice and would recommend them for gate repairs, installations and even if you need custom design gates then this is your company.</Review>

Moses is a good honest man that runs a nice business.  He gives a competitive quote and is willing to do the extras to accommodate customer requests.  He's open to suggestions and will ensure you end up with a high quality fence that will meet whatever needs you may have.</review>

Moses built a 75ft long, 6ft tall privacy fence in our backyard recently. The crew that showed up were friendly and professional. Moses and crew started taking the old picket fence out on a Thursday and had the new fence built wrapped up by Monday. There was some confusion regarding a significant detail about the fence that required an afternoon of rework, but MANDA Gates And Fences was very responsive and accommodating to work through the issue. In the end, they took care of us well and the final result is better than I expected.< /Text>

I would highly recommend this business to install your fence. The service was great and the price was competitive. He came quick for a measurement and installed shortly after. I would hire him again!< /Review>

This is a company that we refer to as an 'always company'. They are always very responsive and helpful; always true to their word; employees in-house and on-site are always very courteous; and always perform top-notch work.  We have found them to be one of the more ethical companies that we use.... and we always use local companies with local employees.</Review>

They had the fence up in two days from start to finish. They used cedar instead of pine fencing which lasts much longer.Quality work, timely expertise in their line of work.Definitely recommend.<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Beautifully done! They installed two fences. One on each side of our house. Work was done to perfection. The crew was on time, on schedule and reasonably priced.

The crew did a phenomenal job on our side gate and sliding RV gate. Everything is custom, and comes with a quality guarantee. They managed to get everything done less than a month after hiring, plus hauled away the old rickety gates at no charge. We even had a hole in our metal awning on the new place we bought, and with rust running through, and they managed to patch that up. Needless to say, if I have any welding needs, I'll be calling him MANDA Gates And Fences.< /text>

They did a great job explaining things well during the consultation, showed up on time and built our new fence to perfection - which isn't easy to do in our yard given the terrain and uneven slopes of the ground. Would definitely recommend Moses and his team for any fence needs.</review>

i've been shopping here for eight years and am always handled like own family once I stroll within the door. they have an amazing selection for nearly any want and that they exit in their way to provide you pointers for your undertaking. That being stated, I knocked off a star because i've noticed the charges on a few things are out of hand.< /Text>

Newland True Value is everything a hardware store should be and more. They have great customer service---always friendly and willing to help. Never a disappointment in finding those detailed parts I needed to complete my home projects.</text>

<review>What more can I say. A great little mom-and-pop type hardware store with  lots of unique items. A large specialty Hardware section, tools, Plumbing, household items, screens, etc. If you know what I mean then you know what I mean.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>I've been shopping here for 8 years and am always treated like family when I walk in the door. They have a good selection for almost any need and they go out of their way to give you tips on your project. That being said, I knocked off a star because I've noticed the prices on some things are out of hand.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Local neiborhood hardware store that always stocks my favorite perfectly chilled FrostTop Rootbeer...
Very friendly and helpful staff.
They practise a unique quality of customer service that is pretty much rarely used now a days and in a professional level of speaking to customers, from what you would think is a stupid question to a profesional answer or sugestion.</Review>< pics>

Newland's is a GREAT hardware business with plenty of assistance, like an old school hardware store! They cut glass were as big box hardware stores do not. I can find the correct screws in their well organized system. I can go on and on......Also,there is PLENTY of parking in back. No more HD for me.<//Text>

<Text>My day started in North Hollywood, California at the Big lots. We were looking for a patio set. They were out. They told us that the Canoga Park, California store had them. We drove to Canoga Park and guess what? They didn't have them. We spoke to this employee in Canoga Park that made it his mission to find it for us. He finally found a store in Santa Paula, California that had what we were looking for. He spoke to an employee named Jose. Jose asked his manager Chris if they can hold the items for us. The policy of the company is not to hold anything for customers, however given the circumstance, he made a decision to hold the two patio sets that we wanted. We drove all the way to Santa Paula and found both Jose and Chris. They were extremely friendly, kind and apologetic for all that we had gone through. Chris, the manager rang up the order for us. He then instructed Jose to take the items out to our truck. They both assisted in putting four large sized boxes on the truck. Chris was gracious enough to tie all of the boxes together so the boxes wouldn't shift or fall during transport. I tried to tip him and he refused to take it saying it was his pleasure to help. Overall the customer service at the Santa Paula, Ca store was excellent. Thank you to Chris and Jose for being great.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1H9sEH2hwWsEIyraYDIQn43_G0gRl54JXUz0P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXKcxs-p93qImC04Aw4WLl13Vpy7ZDZ-uomqXK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO-rtcYiAxVvfRSk8USoXT9aGTWpx10mZIh9beI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWwjqag6j1sNLUkM7ay9s7obyktcrGMrBaF85C=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0L4LDC0qw3-uhir1k5VRbdicHwxgoDPOLlmCO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

Pride Auto Air Conditioning was great to do business with. I took my wife's 2011 Acura  MDX in for an inspection. The auto tech Eddie was straight forward and gave me a quote in less than 5 minutes. He fixed the issue, (replace busted hose and recharge) in 4 hrs. I'm pleased with the work and the professionalism of the front office manager. I'd recommend anyone looking to get their auto A/C fixed to give them a try first.< /text>

This place is not worth 1 star! We brought our suv 2 times because the ac stopped working. The first time the ac worked for like a week. We recently bought back again, the dude was like nothing is wrong and charged us $199 for freon. We took my suv yesterday to an auto shop and they told us we have leak and they're replacing it. So don't waste your time and money here.< /review>

<review>I was convinced to check out this place after reading all the "great" reviews. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't so great. After getting back my car, the issue with my AC wasn't resolved.  I completely understand that sometimes it's trial and error when it comes with cars. I took back my car hoping to get the issue resolved.  The mechanic, I believe his name is Eddie, was rude, very defensive, and dismissive. Right away he seem like he didnt want to deal with my car. Saying he was too busy and that he wasnt going to be able find the problem with the AC. I've worked in customer service for years. I know how difficult it can be to work clients but I never gave him any reason for him to be rude, defensive, or dismissive.<//review><username>Omar Gutierrez<//username>< userid>

< Review>
The number of stars I rate them speaks well of the Pride in their name. I came to the shop for a checkup of my Accord's ac. Eddie found whats wrong, explained to me the necessary repairs to be done and gave me a quote. He made the repairs, charged the system with refrigerant and cleaned the system with compressed air. He even pointed out to me a leak in the power steering hoses. The charges were reasonable and fair. I brought my other car for him to look and see if everything is ok with the ac. He put in a little bit of refrigerant and some cleaning  of the condenser. I highly recommend this shop if you live near or are in the area. Not open on weekends though.<//Review>

< Review>
I found this shop using google maps. I gave them a call to see if I could set up an appointment for tomorrow or even today (march 1, 2016) he said to get there by 3:00pm. I used my lunch hour to race there so  I could hopefully have cold air. My vehicle was inspected and I was quoted a price. I told them to go for it!! This was way too easy!! In less than an hour including travel from walnut I have cold air!! Everything should be this easy. I would recommend this business to a friend......or even a foe!!</Review>

Got an estimate and decided to leave my 06 civic with them for the day. The car was done earlier than expected and for a lower price than the estimate. It's been a few months since getting my ac fixed and still working great. Thank you for a job Well done< /Review>

<Text>This guy is old school.  He won't put parts on your car you don't need, so sometimes you might have to go back a time or two... but it is because he is idealistic and honest and refuses to sell people parts they don't need.  If you want an honest job performed by someone who takes his time, Ron is for you.  I sincerely wished he charged more.. I'm afraid he's still charging '70's prices<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c333b8bccd3c81:0x703059ac1c65e88f</Gmap_id></record>

I've used With Pride twice for repairs, and once to diagnose a problem caused by another shop. Very reasonable and fair pricing. And they didn't charge me anything for the diagnostic visit. Highest recommendation!</text>

<Review>Fred Powell helped my 22 year old Son order the Nectar mattress after trying it out in the store, my Son has been not happy with the mattress we had purchased from Costco about 6 years ago and had heard Nectar Mattress was the way to go. He's an athlete and needs a good nights sleep. After laying on it for sometime in the store he was ready to order. It's guaranteed for a full 365 days and you get a mattress pad and sheet set and two pillows with purchase, added bonus. The sheet bundle is really nice and not sure of the thread count but I am very particular and these feel wonderful. It was quick, easy and I am very pleased with our experience. It was delivered in less than 24 hours and the guys who delivered were wonderful as well. They helped with the mattress we were replacing which I was giving away and they wrapped it quickly in the plastic the new mattress came in, so it would stay clean for the person we are donating the mattress too. All together a terrific experience and would highly recommend Sit 'n Sleep in Fullerton.< /Review><date>1614794379543</date>< Name>

<Review>Arrived in the evening and was greeted by Diego. Explained our current mattress and he showed us some mattresses that were similar to ours. He went over the differences between memory foam, hybrids, standard beds and pillowtop. Explained and showed us options for bedframes as well. Once we chose our mattress checking out was a breeze. He broke down the price and shipping and reminded us that we needed sheets since we upgraded from a queen to a king. Asked us about pillows and a mattress protector too. Setting a delivery date was a breeze and the delivery drivers were courteous and efficient. Thank you Diego for making the process so smooth!<//Review>< user_name>

Fred powell Made us feel welcome the minute we walked in the door. We had no idea what to ask or what to look for. Mr. Powell  made us feel like we were Very important. It was like we became friends instantly. He was so knowledgeable and asked us many questions and the end result was we got in the bed that was perfect for us. He is very experienced and kind and patient. We would recommend him in the store to all our family and friends< /Review>

The process was quite easy but we were scammed. The mattress itself was 1.3 k and he said he would take 100 dollars off but said that the protection and the bed sheets were free. It wasn't and our total was more than expected.< /Text>

I always dreaded buying a mattress... thinking it would be time again to be pressured to buy. What a pleasant surprise at this location where Eddie welcomed us and helped us. I had first come an evening by myself to get my bearings on mattresses and got lots of helpful information and tried several mattresses. Came back on a weekend with my wife (and baby) and we did the test laying down side by side, where their system determined the best fit for each sleeper and recommended mattress to fit both.
I recommend doing this test: they have color-coded their mattresses so it helps identify which ones are probably a good fit for you.

There was a lot of mattresses to try, and the part I really appreciated is that Eddy gave us a lot of space: not pushy one bit. Verdict: bought a king size mattress and adjustable bases. Thank you Eddie.</review>

Floyd was very helpful and knowledgeable... he helped my 88-year old grandmother get the comfiest mattress and even gave her some time to take a test nap... when we left she told me several times that “Lloyd” was very helpful and friendly... overall, we had a very pleasant buying experience.< /review>

Like the computer analysis they have that determines the best bed for your body. Something you cannot do if you buy online. From the analysis the salesperson was able to point us in the right direction. We tried several beds until we found the right one for us. The salesperson was very helpful.< /review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Literally my best experience purchasing a mattress. Dave took great care of me! When I walked in, I was immediately greeted and he advised me he would be with me as soon as he could as he was assisting other customers. Once he was available, we narrowed down what was right for me and then before I knew it we were doing paperwork. The store is well maintained, but when I replace again I’ll be coming back specifically because of Dave. Thank you for making my experience as positive one!< /Review><date>1568432120238< /date>< user_name>

<Review>I met with Dave in November 2019, letting him know that I would be looking for an apartment for the upcoming summer and I would be purchasing a new mattress. First, he had me try the bedmatch technology to find the perfect mattress that’s catered to my sleeping habits. A few minutes later I was matched with the King Koil Xtended Life Grayson. He gave me his card and I told Dave I would see him soon.

Fast forward to July 3, 2020 and Dave remembered me!  I said it was time for that new mattress. Within 20 minutes, I was in and out. I got a great deal because of the 4th of July sale. But most importantly, Dave displayed some of the best customer service I had ever experienced!  Thank you for all your help Dave!< /Review><user_name>Alexander Gallegos</user_name><Gmap_id>0x80dcd601f5cd34c1:0x28e6e91c870f6cf6</Gmap_id><Time>1593823953587< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Walked in and Aaron greeted us immediately! I felt very welcomed. He asked us if we were looking for anything in particular and I said a queen size plush mattress. So he told us anything with the green tag and showed us how each section differs in price range. After that he went away to let us be alone and try out the mattresses and said if we have any questions let him know. Ended up buying a mattress and box spring. Aaron hooked us up with a really nice deal! Overall amazing experience! Thank you Aaron<//Review>

<Review>Chad at Sit & Sleep was so helpful and nice. He had so much patience. He had me try several beds before I chose the one I wanted. Prior to that I told him about my neck and lower back pains. We narrowed it down to 3 beds. He took the time to explain every detail on the bed and refinancing. I would recommend to my friends to try them out first.

Came here to compare mattresses.  We had been shopping around and had a basic idea of what we were looking for.   Floyd was finishing up with a family but was still very attentive and kept checking on my wife and I.   He answered all our questions.   He was knowledgeable and helped us make the right choice for both of us.  I think we got an excellent value for an amazing bed and adjustable frame.   I can’t wait for it to deliver.</Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>I recently stopped into sit n sleep in Fullerton off of harbor looking for a new bed.  Dave was the sales associate that welcomed me and assisted me looking for the right bed.  He put me on the bed match and then started the bed selection.  Went through a few beds and found the ones that i really liked.

I honestly wouldn’t have been able to find the perfect bed without Dave.  The bed match helps, but Dave just knew so much about each mattress and was able to really give great advice when picking out the right mattress for you. Dave wasn’t pushy or overbearing, just really wanted you to make the best decision for you, not just trying to sell you the most expensive thing in the store... unless that’s what you want.

If Anyone is looking for a new bed, sit n sleep might have most of the beds that you might want, but you need to see Dave in Fullerton to find the right bed for you.<//text></record></dataset><record>
<review>The Sales Consultant Dave Fazek was outstanding and really worked to assess and meet our needs.< /review>< Rate>

<text>The staff are extremely helpful and not just trying to sell to make money. I purchases my first queen last year and I am in love with my Beauty Rest pillow top mattress. My mom came to purchase hers a couple weeks ago and unfortunately the guy that helped me transferred to another location but this other guy was very kind and helpful and recommended helpful advice on pillows for my bad shoulders.

Shopping for a mattress can be a major pain followed immediately by buyers remorse. Working with Floyd brought that down dramatically. He was friendly, knowledgeable and never tried to “up sell” me on a mattress I couldn’t afford. He tolerated my pointless stories and even gave this guy a pity laugh when attempting to tell a joke. I have no complaints about me experience...minus the fact that I just shelled out a bunch of money. I guess writing a solid review for a solid experience makes the the lighter wallet worthwhile. Thanks for the help, Floyd. Enjoy my money while I enjoy my mattress.<//Text>

When we arrived, Floyd the manager popped onto the sales floor eager to help us, but also gave us the space and time we needed to talk to each other about what we were looking for. Floyd went above and beyond and was able to get us the bed we wanted and stayed within our budget. I can’t wait for someone to ask me for a mattress referral so I can send them to Floyd and they can relish in the same great experience we had!! Thank you Floyd!!</text>< pictures>

Everything was great except one thing. I purchased a KING size mattress and bed, but for some reason they gave me QUEEN size sheets. No idea why.

Other than that brain dead moment, the people were great and eager to help, especially Floyd.<//text>

Larry was not only nice, he was pleasant to talk too!  He was NOT pushy and answered all of my questions, even when I called him 3-4 times!  He did not ignore other customers while helping me, like most salesman do when they think they have a sale.  I can't say enough about him!   I purchased a bed 3 years ago from the Puente Hills store and had a very bad experience there.  When I buy my next bed, I will buy from LARRY!!!<//Review>< Time>

This is my place. I've even got my kids hooked. Lol. They have everything you need for a great night's sleep. Tencel sheets worth every penny, Tempur pillows that are AMAZING,  bed covers that literally cool you down, and of course they have mattresses, bed frames, headboards. Everything!!. The staff are exceptional. They really know their stuff. Really!! I'll ALWAYS use Sit 'n' Sleep for all these things. #lovemytempurpedic#lovemyergobase#sitnsleepforlife#getone</text>

We purchased a Cal.King mattrass from your store in Jan.2015.
Six months later we noticed that the mattrass had low indentation on both sides where my husband sleeps and  so do I.
I wrote to your main office and got a response that that they will send an inspector to see what the problem is and recieved a letter from the company that is in the limit.
Afer doing that 3 times with no results  we got a letter that they will not help.
We paid quite a bunch of money and our mattrass looks like a camel.
Very desapointed with the company and the treatment we recieved.<//text>

<Review>Great experience with Aaron at the Fullerton store. He was extremely helpful and informative.  We got the opposite customer service at Brea, they were to busy to help and it was like we were bothering them. We left the Brea store went to fullerton and purchased our first king Tempur-Pedic. We also purchased a full for our son. Shop at fullerton NOT Brea.</Review><user>113786922080823365294< /user>< resp>

W hen you roll to the center you have a hump in the bed. the two sides are indented not to comfortable. the company came out to inspect it and it was sunk 7/8 of an inch  and they said it has to be sunk at least 1- 1/2 inch. Inte the store it was nice and firm but you get it home its a different bed.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Barbara Lynne<//username>< response>

Clean shop and seemed to be very popular. Cristina was my stylist and she was great, asked lots of questions so she was sure she understood what I wanted. I was impressed with this business.<//Review>

I moved to the area one year ago and needed to find a new salon/hairstylist. I have now been 3-4 times and the salon experience is great every time. I never feel rushed and my color and cut are fantastic. The salon is easy to get to with plenty of parking and it is always neat and clean and feels very welcoming. Highly recommended!</Review>

La Mode really has a luxury feel to it & I love going in to get my hair done. I have gone to Garrett the few times I have gone in & I don’t have a single regret! He takes his time no matter what I’m getting done & he makes sure that I love my hair before leaving! He makes me feel comfortable & does exactly what I want to my hair. If you’re thinking about going to La Mode, do it & book with Garrett, he’s awesome! The entire experience I have at La Mode makes me feel relaxed and refreshed when I leave. I don’t have to wait around for someone to check me in, they are really professional & on time, which is hard to come by sometimes. I finally found a quality salon & stylist that I feel comfortable going to.</Review>

<review>I went to La Mode for the first time last Saturday and I really enjoyed my experience. The salon itself was very clean and they took all the necessary COVID precautions. Garrett really took his time to cut and style my hair just the way I wanted it. He left my hair feeling soft with a lot of volume. I will definitely be going back to this salon.</review>< Pics>

GARRETT SAVED MY HAIR. I NO LONGER LOOK LIKE A CALICO CAT. As most people do, I base my decision on whether or not to conduct business or purchase a product mostly based on reviews.  That being said, I will admit that I never actually take the time to write them myself, this will be my first.  I made a blind appointment with GARRETT, because of Covid-19 most salons are closed La Mode was one of the few open and the receptionist scheduled me with Garrett.  My previous hair  stylist did not listen, and to be frank she had me out here looking like a calico cat.  Garrett fixed my hair in one sitting, without frying it my highlights are gorgeous.  There's no more patches, and my hair is a beautiful beige blonde that I have been asking for, for over a year.  Other hair stylists told me it would take months and months of me going back every six weeks to have them charge me a fortune for a color correction.  In fact one salon told me they would need all day and two stylists for my hair.  Garrett, is simply amazing. He's amazing enough for me to write my first review. :) I'm so grateful.  Thank you Garrett!<//Text>

My wife went in for a haircut and color. Crystal was her stylist. She did a terrible job the first time by not covering all of her grays. She also had a Brazilian blowout, but it did not have good results. The cut was not what she asked for and the stylist rescheduled for her to come back to redo the color and for a light trim, but the trim turned out to be a disaster. She left my wife’s hair uneven on one side, she made a diagonal cut. It’s obvious that the stylist was upset that she had to work on her hair again, and did it intentionally to ruin her hair. This woman does not know how to cut hair, or mix colors and dye hair properly. The owner was there and saw all of this, but was on the stylist side. All she did was sarcastically say I’m sorry. Someone else would have offered a refund, and shown more concern with the fact that a customer was not happy in her salon. Do not come to this salon, because the owner is on the stylist side, even when they do terrible work. I will file a complaint with the Board of Barbering and Cosmetology.</Text>

I have been a long time customer and have always been extremely satisfied with the overall experience. The stylists remain current with styles and products. The customer service is excellent and I have recommended La Mode Salon to my friends and will continue to do so.

I am still a happy and satisfied customer of La Mode Salon 3 years later.  The salon's atmosphere is wonderful!  The stylists are very accommodating  and friendly.  I have recommended this salon to friends and they too are very happy with the service and styles they receive from La Mode Salon.</review>

I've been coming here for about I would say three years now. I started coming here when I had short hair now and now I have long curly hair. Garrett has always been my hairstylist, he really does a great job, everyone there is nice plus i like clean environment and the service they provide. The owner Linda is very sweet and always greets me with a smile. The whole team is awesome and I wouldn't go anywhere else. Thank you La Mode salon and thank you Garrett for always keeping me on Point! Lastly for all the great hair products you offer me -they really do the work!< /text>

I am always more than happy every single time I get my hair color and cut with Cori! She exceeds my expectations on every visit. She is an expert, true professional, a perfectionist at her best, thorough and explains what she understands that you want, then gives her expert opinion as to why. She leaves the decision up to you.  I am a happy client through and through. I have referred many friends to Cori, and they have all remained Cori's regular clients since. We All Love her attention to detail, her work, knowledge and professionalism! SHE IS THE BEST STYLIST EVER!</Text>

"Linda has been in charge of my hair for years....and long may it continue. She's excellent, thoughtful and genuine. I consider her a friend. The whole staff at La Mode are friendly and personable and treat each other like family . I've no intention of going anywhere else as long as there's hair on my head and as long as Linda's hands don't drop off!"

Absolutely love this place. Everyone makes you feel right at home. Garrett is my stylist. I have never thought short hair looked good on me so I was hesitant letting someone new cut my hair...but I was shocked at how amazing it turned out! It was so cute and perfect. He is now the only stylist I will let cut my hair. I walk out of the salon happy every single time 😊< /Text>

<review>I love everything about this salon. Linda has been cutting and coloring my hair for 12 years, and even though we moved away from the area six years ago, my husband and I continue to drive more than an hour each way because she is not only incredibly skilled at adding subtle highlights to my hair and cutting both my hair and his, but she genuinely cares about us, our families, each and every client, and every stylist in the salon. This really is a place where you can explain what you want your hair to look like and enjoy the process and the results.</review>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Sent my mom here last week to get her hair done and she came back extremely pleased! She was telling me all about how friendly and helpful the staff was and how much she enjoyed her time there. She got her hair colored and cut, which can often be a long and drab process. However, she told me the appointment flew by and that she felt extremely cared for.

I'm super thankful for the team at La Mode for giving my mother an exceptional experience. She will definitely be going back in the future!< /review>

I highly recommend La Mode in Murrieta. I have been visiting since the salon opened and the owner, Linda, has been designing my hair for well over 14 years. The salon is elegant and radiates friendliness and warmth. It is beautifully decorated and also clean and well maintained. Linda has never failed to amaze me - I bring pictures and she will tell me what works and what doesn't for my hair. I can honestly say over the years I have had every style and every length and color. I have never been disappointed! Linda's team are so friendly and helpful. It is obvious they are constantly having ongoing training to maintain their high standards. They stock beautiful products and are happy to recommend styling products to suit the style created. I can honestly say that when I visit I feel like I am visiting old friends - thank you Linda and your team - you guys are the best!!< /text>

I have been a client of La Mode salon since it's opening.  The salon is modern and comfortable.  My stylist Linda stays apprised of all the new techniques and products which, I love! She is one that listens and asks questions about what you want so that you leave the salon feeling like you look great.  I strongly recommend the team at La Mode and my favorite stylist, Linda.< /text>

<Review>Jackie hasn't been there long but did an excellent job fixing up my pixie haircut. The previous one was too boyish and had a lot of uneven edges (I had to go to a bargain place with a hair emergency). The conversation was excellent, there were free beverages provided, and the environment was both fun and relaxed. All in all a wonderful experience.</Review>< Date>

Can't say enough about this salon!  The stylist are awesome, the space itself is really cute and welcoming, the products are great and service is always great.  I have been going to the salon since they opened and it is so cool to see how it has evolved and grown.  I would absolutely recommend them and have to friends, family and strangers who ask where I get my hair done.  If you are looking for a great salon, I highly recommend you check them out!!<//review>

I love this salon and my stylist Linda.  She is very knowledgeable about curly hair and very caring for all her clients.  She has given me awesome haircuts, styling tips and products to use that really work with curly hair.  It is a great salon with many wonderful stylists and I highly recommend it.< /text>

I have been going to La Mode- Murrieta since the year it opened.  Linda has been my stylist for well over 10 years. I have extremely thick hair that takes a lot of time to color, cut and style.  Linda  ALWAYS takes her time and does and amazing job.  I leave there feeling amazing.
The salon itself  is always clean and all the entire staff is courteous and friendly.< /text>

I've been getting cuts from Linda for 7 years and they continue to be the best I've ever had. She is skilled, talented, funny and kind. Lovely relaxed atmosphere...no uptight salon vibes. When friends ask, I always send them here.<//Review>

<Text>Today was my first time at this location, I previously went to the Menifee location.  I switched because Stevie started working at this one and she is the best! Stevie is a wonderful person and amazing stylist! She always does an awesome job on my hair.  This establishment is very clean, chic and plenty of parking! The price is definitely worth the service and hospitality you receive! I don't go anywhere else to get my hair done except La Mode. :)<//Text><username>Jaelen Knolla<//username><time>1493678032627< /time></record>

Everyone at the salon is very friendly and they make you feel like you are in charge of your hair...they will do whatever you want with a smile.

<Review>Cori has been doing my hair for years and I wouldn't go to anyone else! I trust her opinions over even my own sometimes, she has a way of interpreting what I describe and really making my hair come to life. I used to color my hair dark brown (almost black) and she helped me transition to blonde seamlessly with no damage. She's also the word of reason when I get a crazy idea about something I've seen on Pinterest. To put it simply: she knows my hair and she knows what I like, that kind of trust is priceless. I've followed her whenever she has switched salons and am happy she's now at La Mode. The interior of the salon is beautiful and I love that they carry the Bumble products line!<//Review><Name>Amanda Wardlaw< /Name>< userid>

<Review>I have never written a review before, but if I can help just one person in the same situation that I was, then this will be well worth it. La Mode Salon in Murrieta is by far the best hair salon in the area. After having the same hair stylist for almost 9 years (at a different salon that I won't mention), I seemed to be stuck in a rut. As I was getting older my hair was thinning, and the texture was changing. Although I continually expressed my concerns, and said I wanted to change things up, it always fell on deaf ears. Repeatedly each time after getting my hair done, I would leave with the same style and color as the time before. I became so frustrated that I began to look for a new hair stylist. After extensive research, and reading lots of reviews, I decided to try La Mode Salon in Murrieta. I am so glad I made this choice, and I could not be happier. My stylist is Linda, and I must say she is wonderful. She is just shy of a miracle worker. I love that I never feel rushed. She always listens patiently and carefully to my concerns and ideas, and then discusses options combining my request and her ideas together. She makes me feel so comfortable, and I completely trust her opinions.  In the 4+ years that I’ve been going to Linda at La Mode, I have not once left unhappy after an appointment. This place is wonderful! Believe me you will not be disappointed.</Review>< name>

I have curly hair, and not every stylist knows how to cut and style it. Cori is awesome. Call her now.<//Text>

She listened to my concerns and began working. I left the shop happy and back to myself. The people are friendly, shop is clean and all the beatitians are great. (You get to see a lot while your color is cooking)
The best thing about Crystal is that she listens and does what you want, not to say she wouldn't suggest if she thought you needed something a little different, but there is a conversation. You don't leave vowing never to go back because your hair is not what you wanted.
I would highly recommend La Mode Salon!
Have a great day! ❤️🐾</Text>< pics>

Love this salon and absolutely love Jax!! I've trusted her with my hair for years. She's taken me from pixie to long and back again. And from platinum to black and every shade inbetween. Always 5 stars!< /Text>

I have been going to La Mode Salon for over four years now and I love this salon. The staff is amazing! I was greeted by Jessica and was asked if I needed anything then proceeded to inform my stylist Stephanie that I was here. It is refreshing to be greeted immediately with a smiling face and made to feel that you are a top priority.

The salon is amazing. Very clean, open and beautifully decorated. My favorite is the chandelier that brings a touch of elegance. The staff and other stylists are so friendly, warm and inviting.

My stylist is Stephanie Guest! I have been going to Stephanie for over four years! She is amazing! I always seem to want to make a color change to go darker. Stephanie listens intently and always has done what I have requested and also provided me with future options for color and highlights that would enhance the look and am trying to achieve. I have 100% confidence in Stephanie! She is a stylist that keeps up on the latest trends, knows what she is doing and understands the look that I am trying to achieve.

In addition, I very much value the fact that La Mode has stayed in business and Stephanie has remained there. So many times, salons close due to lack of business, poor client service...this is very important to me. I like to know that I have a solid salon to go to and a stylist that does not constantly change locations...I feel part of the La Mode Family...keep up the outstanding service you provide!!!

I have been with Cori Mangos going on 7 years. She does a wonderful job on my hair keeping it healthy and looking nice (and I am really picky). Cori has moved up the ladder with La Mode Salon and I can see why, she is professional and educated on hair care, styles,  coloring and the featured hair products Bumble & Bumble and United.

La Mode is a happy, professional, clean salon that makes you feel welcome whatever your age. I have introduced my high school aged daughter to Cori and she is now a client to Cori as well. I am pleased that Cori has found her career with La Mode Salon as it is a A+ In my book.

I highly recommend La Mode Salon in Murrieta!!!

Izabela did an amazing balayage in my hair. Lightening my hair was a challenge because it is extremely dry and damaged and has been neglected for an embarrassingly long time. She explained everything before doing anything to my hair to make sure I understood and was ok with everything throughout the process. She was friendly and nice but still upfront and honest so I knew what to expect and I couldn't be happier with the results. She also gave me EXACTLY what I asked for and want in a cut. I hadn't been to a salon in years because horrible past experiences but she has renewed my faith. I will be returning to her for all of my hair care needs in the future.</text>

They are great people and all of the stylist there do an awesome job. They definitely earned a favorable review and recommendation. If you need a hair stylist or hair cut and live in or around the Murrieta / Temecula area then stop by La Mode Salon.</Text>< pics>

My hair is dry, damaged, and unruly........basically I have curly, curly, really curly 3B type hair. I've always had trouble finding a stylist that knows how to handle curly hair. Ever since I've moved from Orange County to now Murrieta / Temecula, It's been even harder to  find a new stylist in this area. I don't like choosing any establishment by how many stars they have on Yelp, but I am a visual person and the pictures of La Mode Salon look amazing! So I took a chance.....And thank goodness I did!!

Rick is now the one and only person who can touch my hair LOL He not only knows how to cut and style curly hair, he's good at every other kind of texture and hair type's (from my friends that I referred). He definitely knows what he's doing and does a great job of asking you questions and giving you recommendations based on your hair type, daily routine, maintenance level, and facial structure..etc. And good thing he does, because honestly not every cut and color is for EVERYONE. The other thing I like about Rick, was that he made it point to educate me about how to keep my hair healthy. Prior to my visit I fried my hair with intense heat and chemicals, which left my hair dull and breaking at not only the ends but the middle. I've been scared to blow dry my hair or straighten it. Now with Rick's help  my natural curl and moisture is finally coming back and every now and then I let him blow dry it straight(which he's amazing at btw) And if a stylist knows how to do perfect a blowout on crazy curly hair, and it lasts for days?........then you know he's good! So ask for RICK!< /Text>

I brought pictures of color and style and did not get what I requested. I also think the pricing is outrageous and especially when I hate it!  I wish I could add the pictures maybe a link to show the differences<//Text>

I had the pork belly Benedict,  their Bourbon, coffee and cream beverage and the donuts with butterscotch. Really flavorful, very friendly staff as well as prompt service! I would definitely return!</text>

Great place to stop for a bite to eat. I had the chicken sandwich, I wished it was bigger as I ate it with pure delight it was awesome.  Paul our server was excellent checking on our table frequently was appreciated.  Thanks Paul.</Review>

The food is good, but I would stay away from their party package. What you see in the picture attached cost $70! It was supposed to feed 5 adults, but as you can see the sides will only feed 2. Also, they will block you on their social media if you call anything out that they don't like.<//Text>

Excellent place. I live in the senior building next to the restaurant. Food and service is great. Don't let the surrounding area detour you. The people outside are dunks and drug addicts. No reflextion on the great food and great atmosphere<//review>

<text>I’m not sure what new Oakland we have going on here to have rated this place so highly, my experience was totally different....

My roommate and I hosted a few friends for a small celebration. Because we have a few neighbors who speak highly of this place and it’s reviews he decided to buy their party pack. Online it reads it should serve 3-5 people. We received 8 pieces of chicken, a side salad enough for one maybe two if portioned small, a side of vegetables enough for one maybe two if portioned small and cornbread enough for two. To top it all off, the chicken was more bone than meat.

When I called to ask about what we received the woman who answered the phone told me the meal had been portioned correctly and they’ve sold over “5000 meals that way” and here I am thinking..... he just spent $70 on this. The problem isn’t the money but the portion and the quality both of their product and service. This was poor on all accounts. To make matters worse when he reached out to them on various social media outlets they blocked him rather than address the issue or to explain their service, another poor response. This review was set to be two stars as at least there food was flavorful and cooked well, but for such poor service it’s inexcusable.

When compared to various other eateries in the area I’d say take your money to Gus’, Cater to U, hell even Krispy Kruncy is better than this. For $70 the caliber of what we received should have been top of the line.

Inappropriate on all accounts.< /text><Gmap_id>0x808f80ae5ae98e41:0x77d349a4ec94a7e3< /Gmap_id><rate>1<//rate>< pictures>

<time>1613331784191<//time><text>This would be a hard place to find if it had not been recommended. It is truly wonderful: the friendly staff, the amazing cocktails, and truly terrific food. I would characterize Hopscotch as a bistro. The patrons were truly a mix of all kinds or folks, and the entire place had a great vibe of secret, but unpretentious, destination. My Brussels sprouts, oysters, fried chicken and donuts--yes, donuts for dessert, accompanied by a butterscotch creme for dipping!--all were absolutely wonderful. I'll be to Oakland soon again, and I hate to forego other dining opportunities, but I've got to come back to Hopscotch again.

This is a cute spot. It seems some of the old fashioned coffee shop elements are still in tact. The house special is the fried chicken . It was very good. Actually everything was really good. We had tubs Ap, salad chicken and a beignet with a delish custard dipping sauce. I'd eat here again in a heartbeat<//review>

The chips were still so crispy and well salted. The burger bun was a bit soggy but the meat was cooked well and the lengua was so tender. The donuts were so delicate and the cream was perfect, not too sweet. The maple old fashioned was just the right amount of sweetness, I wish we had ordered more than one order.<//text>

<Review>I did not enjoy eating here. Their sides are awkward how do you serve fried chicken and not have sides like mashed potatoes or mac & cheese ? The service was very cold not a very inviting vibe. Had a side of broccoli and bacon and it was really cold like it came out of the refrigerator I guess that’s how they serve it. It just was nothing special. I honestly could’ve save $25 and ate at McDonald’s and been happier</Review>< pictures>

Great service, delicious food, and awesome cocktails. The location is conveniently close to the freeway and had plenty of street parking too. We made a reservation so there wasnt a wait. It wasn't too busy on a Sunday afternoon even if you don't have a reservation. Definitely coming back here again so we can try all the different cocktails and meals.<//Text>

This restaurant was very cute, the service hospitable.

I came to have dinner before a show and had to take my entree to go. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it better had I ate it there. I had ordered fish and the entree was all messy by the time I got to it later. It was good though...but I would have preferred the experience the short time I actually was at Hopscotch

There I had the oysters, pickles, and sparkling wine. It was all wonderful. Again I wish I could have enjoyed everything there. I did not want to leave.</review>

<Text>Cozy and contemporary diner feel to this spot!

Besides the carafe size that was disappointing for 3 people, the food was delicious and service was great!

Scrambled eggs and biscuits was comfort to the soul. Buttermilk chicken is a must get!  Their fried batter was so bomb, lightly crisp and treasurable to the taste buds.  Chicken meat was superbly tender and went well with the sesame dresses salad!  Kimchi fried rice with soft boiled egg was on point.

I loved the fluffy cinnamon donuts at the end with the creamy dip that they provided along with it.  It made it a hop to my step and a smile of pure delight when I was done!<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Arrived at almost 3PM on a Saturday to a full house. Grab a seat at the bar and was told we can still order brunch item. Also caught the last couple days of Oakland Restaurant Week. The brunch menu for Restaurant Week is a solid deal, 1 donut + coffee or tea (jade green was some really good green tea!), 1 cocktail, and 1 main entree (came in huge portion).
We tried the fried chicken with biscuit and pork sausage gravy (awesome fried chicken, crispy, juicy and flavorful) the kimchi fried rice with shoyu egg (4 halves 😮)

Tip:
1) Get the fried chicken and try with the orange hot sauce
2) Happy hour daily from 3-5PM (see picture for menu)<//Review>

We ordered the lamb pasta, green salad, fish with seafood broth and chocolate mousse. The salad and lamb pasta were good but nothing spectacular. The cod was really delicious but the clams and mussels tasted fishy and gritty. Chocolate mousse was served frozen unlike other places but I enjoyed it with the sesame cookie under it! Service was excellent. Friendly staff.< /review><time>1482299733251</time></record>

Donuts and butterscotch cream are not to be missed. Lightest and fluffiest clouds of fried dough I've ever had.< /Text>

A small place that you could miss walking by if it weren't for the line outside of people wanting to come in and eat. Its kind of a confusing place...old school diner feel for Japanese fusion food. Fried chicken was done well. Pork chop was decent but would maybe recommend something else. Whiskey selection was good. Recommend reservations!< /text>

Small seating area with big flavors. Street parking only. I’ve tried it twice and both times were great. Great attentive service, very kind. Handicap accessible. Beer and wine available. I’d say it’s kid (family) friendly but be prepared to sit very close to next table. One restroom available. They said they are known for the fried chicken. It was really super!  My only complaint is that the chicken served with a side of slaw was $24.00 plus.< /review>

{'time': 1522813694166, 'text': "Hi Matt,\nI rarely reply individually, but I wanted to personally apologize for your experience on Easter Sunday Brunch.  As you can imagine, it is one of our busiest brunches of the year.  Unfortunately one of our team members had a death in the family and I had to jump in at the last moment to bartend for the day.  I'm a seasoned bartender, but as the owner, I don't spend much time slinging drinks anymore, so my ticket times were slow.  And I was unable to be on the floor supporting the staff amidst the rush. The dessert cocktail you ordered is one I haven't made in a while and it definitely took too long. I am so sorry. Generally we are known for our congeniality, but I think the day had been really waring on us all at that point.  I'm sorry that you bore the results.  If you give us another chance, please let me know you are coming in so I can try to make it up to you.\nSincerely,\nJenny Schwarz\nOwner, Hopscotch\njenny@hopscotchoakland.com"}</Resp>

<review>Very overpriced (pork ragu was 24, doughnuts were 10) but the food was solid. Nothing mind blowing, but the depth of flavor was very well done. I recommend getting the ragu with a little hot sauce, as that breaks up the flavor of the ragu a bit more.< /review></record>

I came here for my 30th birthday during Restaurant Week and the team at Hopscotch was very accommodating leading up to dinner - very responsive over email, answering questions, giving me an option to add a customizable message on the menu, etc.

I didn’t have a cocktail but my friends did and they all enjoyed them. The Norteño comes to mind as a particularly good one with green pepper vodka (perhaps from St. George’s?). Nice selection of wine that is reasonably priced. As for the food, Restaurant Week for our group size was a set menu, family style.

A few key items: started off with a kale salad (👍🏽), Kakiage - tempura veggie/bamboo shoots which was great, and burrata with squash (best of the bunch).

For the mains, the spatzel with brats was fine but nothing unique about it. Same with the buttermilk fried chicken which seems to be their most popular dish (not as much flavor as expected and ours were a bit dried out). The soba malfadine carbonara was great! I added some salt to bring out the flavors after breaking the yolk but I liked the fusion between Japanese + Italian.

Dessert was awesome. Loved the donut and mud pie combo. Donut could’ve been hotter but I imagine it’s because of our large party + the extra 45 seconds of the HBD song 😆

Overall, I didn’t think it was worth the $40 price tag, mostly because the quantities weren’t on par. Now, this might be due to the group/family style/restaurant week factor but none of us left full. One note about their service: they graciously comped one meal as my gluten-free guest was mostly neglected throughout the meal. I had to ask several times what she could eat and what she couldn’t eat despite stating in advance and getting confirmation days before) her dietary restrictions. That bit was disappointing but this stuff happens and I appreciated their manager apologizing profusely and making amends. Would I return? Possibly but perhaps with a smaller group.<//Review>

We had a 10:30 am brunch reservation were the first guests to arrive.  The hostess asked us to wait and than asked if we had reservation I said yes and provided the name of reservation.
She proceeded to walk us out the door of the main dining to the overflow annex a cold less comfortable environment.  I thought it was extremely odd, trying not to assume the worst.
My party was disappointed started looking for new restaurant for brunch. The waitress was kind & closed the door the temperature of the room became acceptable and we stayed.

The food arrived  some was excellent and other items not so much the chicken appeared to be pre fried and fried again.

There was a lack of coffee choices no alternative milk.

They began seating people in our area 35 minutes later overheard party stating they did not have reservations.

I would not recommend this restaurant<//text>

<username>Allie Miller<//username><Date>1587253938010<//Date><Rate>1</Rate><Review>I'm not usually one to write reviews when stuff isn't the best but all parts of this experience was a huge bummer. I ordered off of caviar, and I live a few blocks away so it shouldn't have been an ordeal. I placed the order, and waited an hour before calling Hopscotch to see what the status was. After calling twice and being hung up on as soon as someone picked up the phone, I finally got through. They said the order was on the way. I waited another hour and called again. Still on the way. After two hours I get my meal and it's completely burnt. Really bad communication and terrible quality.</Review>< Pictures>

I had the kimchee with pork belly. The pork belly addition was not worth it as it was mostly fat. The Meal lacked much flavor and needed salt and pepper. However the Pimms cup cocktail was very tasty. The prices here average around $15-20. I tried my cousins Chicken and biscuits I was jealous lol They didn’t run the a/c and we were burning up!< /text>

Went for happy hour. Delicious wings and cocktails (surprisingly good cocktails)! Oysters so-so (fries served to people next to us looked like they'd be tasty though we didn't have room to get them). Friendly people and v good service. I'd go back for more!</review>

<text>Ate there alone the first time (around 3pm - because awesomely they do not close between lunch and dinner!) I wish I had a video of the experience because it was just SO sweet. But first and foremost let me tell you the meal was scrumptious. Eggs Benedict salmon style: Perfect poached eggs with very yummy hollandaise on thick fresh lovely egg bread - a hunk of smoked salmon - juicy and house made - and the best brunch potatoes I ever ate - made in their own little individual caste iron pan. Delish green salad or fruit salad also part of the game. The server was a guy so kind so thoughtful and professional it brought out my Cheshire Cat smile! I’ve now gone several times with family and friends and Hopscotch has that kind of discipline and consistency I really do love. Bartender is also a sweetheart. I do happen to like their red leather bistro diner look. I’m the spoiled one so trust me. Top notch effort and cuisine. Go uptown for this one!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I went for brunch and got the kimchi fried rice with pork belly. It sounded great in the beginning but when it finally arrived, the fried rice was overly salty, the pork belly tasted really flat. It's pretty to look at (when adorned with so many onsen eggs) but when you eat it, it ends up being a burden to eat it all.

I did get the doughnut as an appetizer (it should be treated like a dessert). It tastes like what you can get at Doughnut Dolly's, so you should just go there instead.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGQQ0dDCwF_odzVYMe86wMe8LPcTdDY39Aun94=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHstuBeTlJWbtj0QNZYnAWYr8BB5ZMdkA9ZpuB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>The waitress charged 20% for the tip. We were seated in the other part of restaurant that didn't have ac. It was super hot and they gave me not so cold water. They had a great sirloin steak though. Although the steak was well done, they were still very moist and soft.</review>< Pics>

Hands down the best restaurant in Oakland.  Their pork chop is my favorite thing to eat when it is on the menu.  Last time I had braised Lamb neck which sounds a little adventurous, but blew everyone in the group away.  Wine list and service are on point too.  Fried chicken is awesome, but I feel like there are too many other good items on the menu to warrant ordering it unless you are in a big group.  Should be everyone's go to restaurant recommendation if anyone asks because they are always consistent and won't let you down.</review>

We've been coming here for a few years now and I'm never disappointed. The food is excellent and the service is great. The only downsides is that we live far from it and that it's in a marginally shady area. But hey, it's a risk I'm willing to take to come here.<//Text>

Hopscotch is a tastefully laid out American Japanese fusion food affaire. Small restaurant with seating for maybe 30 inside, a few tables outside.

Our food was pretty stellar. Fried chicken, biscuits and gravy, country potatoes, all great. Drinks were good as well (gin fizz). We did have to wait over 30 minutes for our order to be retaken because our bartender forgot to put it in, so I have to detract a star for that; realistically, I don't see service being an issue at all normally.

Also a great selection of unique scotches which I can't wait to try next time. Be aware the prices are not cheap but the food portions are pretty generous. This place is worth a try, you won't regret it.< /text>

I got it with the chips and it was a great compliment.Also shared a side salad that was fresh and very well made.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Very big portions the lemon chicken salad was definitely big enough for two. Had great spots to sit inside looking out on the street... Don't go here unless your prepared to spend around 20$ the only down side< /Text>

We came here during 'restaurant week' and they had an odd menu combination where some things had to be ordered as a package deal, which was unnecessary. The waitress was great about explaining it and finding solutions though. Generally very good service. The restaurant itself is small and loud, which can be good or bad depending on what kind of night you are looking for. Felt a bit cramped but the food made up for it. Overall a good experience.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Excellent food and service. This is a bit of a hole-in-the-wall with four tables outside and maybe ten inside. You can also eat at the bar. Their mixed drinks are excellent and unusual. Our shared starter of tempura-fried vegetables was very tasty, but a bit on the greasy side. Two of us had the buttermilk fried chicken and one the halibut. All the mains were great. We shared one dessert, the doughnuts. Don't be put off by the name. Try it. Overall I would give Hopscotch five stars except I think it is overpriced. Three of us with drinks, a bottle of wine, one starter, one dessert and three mains racked up a bill of $270 with tip. That is very expensive for what and where it is.<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>Hopscotch got in touch and pointed out, quite rightly, that my initial review was not helpful. So I am elaborating a bit. I have heard a lot about this restaurant and was simply disappointed.  Getting served initially took some time. Our party was served after a party of the same size who arrived and was seated well after us, which is always a bit disappointing. However once service began the wait staff was very kind and attentive throughout the remainder of the meal. I had the fried chicken. The salad accompanying it was great, flavorful and fresh. The chicken was rather bland, and not evenly cooked throughout.< /review>< Pics>

Very friendly & small. About 3 blocks from the Oakland VA. A bit pricey, the proportions and taste will make up for the price. I will definitely will be there if I have time Wendy visiting the Oakland VA or that part of Oakland.</Review>

I only had one lunch and for the second lunch meeting had dessert.

The wine selection is quite big and the prices are pretty reasonable. They also have 4 or 5 draft beers to choose from. The food is good quality and done with care and creativity. There is bit of Japanese/Asian influence but overall result is very good. The service is very good. The staff is courteous and attentive without being intrusive. This will be my go-to place if I am in the Oakland area.</review>< pictures>

Nice place for a light meal. Came here with a group of five for dinner and we were able to be seated outside right away which was great. We had cocktails which were pricey but they were delicious, too. The waitstaff were very attentive and patient with us as we took forever to decide what we wanted. In the end, three of us got the hamburger because it was the cheapest entree option and the other entrees seemed very overpriced, but the appetizers were smaller. One person in our party got the soba noodles which she did not recommend and did not finish. The burgers were good (comes with beef tongue on top which was very tasty!). Overall, we were happy with our choice of coming here, especially because it was a beautiful day and we were sitting outside.<//Review>

A great spot to sit and stay late with friends.  Friendly staff, and they even allow you to taste a wine if you have a question.  Our table had the oysters—nice and fresh.  I enjoyed my pork, and the tri-tip was very tasty, as was the trout.  Try the dessert menu—small but fun.  Finally, we had takeaway friend chicken.</Text>

Some things on the menu change, some stay the same. Asian inspired modern California cuisine. The fried chicken is amazing, the burger is great. Other than that, I recommend getting a bunch of the small plates and sharing a big one or two. Pretty good beer selection, all the cocktails I've gotten there were great.< /Review>

<text>I love their food, they have a great selection of Japanese whiskeys and great cocktails like "Sizzle it", but the bartenders are dry and unapproachable. I like Aubrey and Nomi, the place is chilled but again If I'm going to spend $80-100 on a meal with 2 cocktails the least I expect is a smile or some type of interaction from the bartender otherwise I'm just giving my money to a light pole.< /text><name>Astro Keka<//name>< Time>

We had the fried chicken with gravy, the donuts, and the hopscotch burger. The fried chicken was phenomenal, one of the best I've had in the East bay. The burger was tender and juicy, and I'd say on the top 5 burgers I've had though perhaps a little too drippy. The donuts were small portion for the price but they include a delicious butterscotch cream that is really good. Brunch is definitely the best time to go but seating is limited so be prepared to wait.< /Review>

<Text>Nice ambience, but fried chicken was far from stellar. Seasoning on skin was too strong and distracting, with the whole fried chicken piece being difficult to eat. Strongly recommend trying a different dish.<//Text>< pics>

If you find yourself in Oakland, unsure about where to get food,go to Hopscotch. This place will make your food dreams come true. I ordered the Lotus fritters (delicious) as my starter, and the Pork chop‎ (amazing) as my main course. Those were the two best choices I had made in a while. The fritters were perfect. The right combination  of crunch and acidity. The pork chop was the star. It is a very thick cut of meat. But unlike more expensive restaurants I have visited, this pork chops was perfectly cooked. It was juicy and full of flavor... Magical. The sides were just as good. ‎My advice, hop over as soon as you can.< /review>

Cool little unique spot, but just not for me. If you're introducing yourself to this place, try out the burger. I had never had cow tongue before this and it was actually a nice touch. My waitress Atalya was quite nice as well.< /review>

<username>Marchal Monckton<//username><review>I went here with a group of about 10 for our holiday lunch. The food was all really good. I had the first base burger with bacon and cheese and a few of the appetizers. It was a little weird that we were seated in a different space two doors down from the main restaurant. It also took quite a while to have our meal. While I appreciate a good leisurely meal, 2.5 hours was a long time for a lunch.<//review><UserId.>101451200018609663610<//UserId.></record>

I love this kind of upscale Japanese-American fusion food. I haven't seen that much Japanese-American fusion, so I thought that this place was pretty cool and unique. I really enjoyed the food here and the interesting flavors that come from combining Japanese cuisine with American cuisine. I came here for the brunch and got the Braised Pork Belly Benedict. It was very nontraditional and different from a regular eggs benedict. The pork belly had a soy sauce asian flavor which was very interesting in combination with the hollandaise. It was also very tender and fatty which added more richness to the dish. The dish as a whole was almost too rich and I'm glad it came with a side salad.<//review>

{'time': 1540667878739, 'text': "Hi Campbell,\nI'm sorry that you had a less than stellar experience.  Our pork chops are of the highest quality locally sourced meat.  Chef recommends they be served medium, but we do always take a temperature when we take the order and are happy to cook the pork all the way through. If a dish is not to a guests liking, we are happy to fix it or get something else out as soon as possible.  I wish you would have let us know while you were dining so that we could have had an opportunity to rectify the situation."}</response>
< Review>
Great location but they served me a raw (literally book me a taxi to the hospital raw) piece pork. The waiter (who coincidentally asked if a vodka soda was on the rocks or not) didn’t appear concerned or apologetic about the chiefs inability to cook a pork chop. This place seems like it would have a lot of potential but poor execution. Shame.</Review>

I had the buttermilk chicken sandwich, someone else had the pulled pork sandwich and lastly the hamburger with french fries and a delicious dipping sauce. Perfect for lunch, it's close to the courthouse so parking was not a problem and there's outdoor seating too. Do try!!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>We arrived without a reservation, so they opened up their second seating area right away. You’d think given we were in a separate area we might be a little neglected - but the service was exemplary throughout the entire meal. We got the tri tip steak, the green salad, and the fried chicken. The salad actually blew us away and I can’t recommend it enough. The steak was perfectly cooked and the chicken was ideal. I also ordere the Impeachment cocktail and have been dreaming about it since.Every part of this meal was amazing, and the staff were incredible. Can’t go wrong!</text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808f80ae5ae98e41:0x77d349a4ec94a7e3</GmapID></record>

<Text>Cozy small restaurant with great food and awesome staff. Their oysters are among the better we've tried and their burger the best to date, despite costing only 15 bucks. Also their brisket was super tasty.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Small space, but Fabulous Food & Drink.  I have been twice the last two years and was stoked both time!  This is real high end comfort food that will more than satisfy, but amaze you and yours.  I get to Oakland fairly often for film and shows and this a must stop place if time permits!!< /review>

A shining star in Oakland’s dining scene, Hopscotch combines Japanese and American flavors for a top notch brunch and dinner.  Tip: order the fried chicken and try the Yonsei oyster with Uni, salmon roe, and raw oyster.</review>

We ordered the uni ravioli, the asparagus, and the fried chicken. The uni ravioli is a magic trick invented to allow you to imagine a sashimi scallop wrapped around uni is a ravioli, supported by shoshito oil and herbs. OMG. The asparagus, perfectly firm without any woodiness, had a lovely mayo sauce, flakes of parmesan, and the platonic ideal of anchovy slivers (silver skin, a gentle salty smoky flavor). The buttermilk fried chicken was slightly hot, and a confusing anatomy of white meat (even on the drumstick) and wonderfully crunchy crust. A house-made chili sauce, thin, clear, hot and still with flavor, was provide in a cruet. You must get yourself here.< /Review>

<review>We order out from Zacharys at least once a month. The restaurant is small and crowded at night so we always do take out! Best deep dish - spinach and mushroom and good health chicken. Now we also order gluten- free but can't get in deep dish - still delicious but flat! Recommendation - order a few hours before you...< /review>< userid>

Hopscotch is supposedly a "trendy" restaurant in the  Alameda/Oakland area that my wife and I visited on our Honeymoon. It has way too limited seating which is not ADA friendly what so ever. And while the food is eclectic, the taste is lacking. It is certainly not worth the price.< /text>

This restaurants flavor profile and food combinations are terrible! That cannot be a true chef creating that menu. Cod is a soft fish great for stews or battering. They served it with cooked spinach and miso. It was an extremely mushy dish. No texture. The fried chicken came in a bed of cabbage. It was fried hard and had thin and dry batter. The sunchokes were tasty, but needed an aioli or some type of Sauce. The chicken could use some dipping sauce also. They served cold mozzarella on top of cooked veggies. And gave us tiny, cold, uncooked tofu cubes with what tasted like the sweet red sauce you get from the Chinese restaurant. Absolutely nothing about anything on that menu was worth our $150 meal. Fortunately the company paid for it, but we could've went ANYWHERE cheaper and had quality options. The idea is high end, but the food is not.< /Review>

<Review>If there's a better place for brunch in Oakland, I don't know what it is. I can't seem to stop coming here. The bartenders - Aubrey and Cody - make excellent cocktails. But then, Hopscotch has a compelling list of Japanese whiskeys in addition to Scotch, bourbon whiskeys and Irish whiskeys. Then there's the food - the buttermilk fried chicken and biscuit with sausage gravy is superb. So too are the benedicts - they should just bottle their hollandaise sauce. Oysters - outstanding. The Thistle Meat bacon - outstanding. The wine list.... I could go on and on. Just go!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I tried the chicken and biscuits and the eggs benedict with pork belly. The pork belly seems like more of an afterthought, nothing really special about them. The fried chicken is really good though, very moist and flavorful throughout. They have a house made hot sauce that is not really hot at all, but it does add a nice layer of acid to the chicken, which will help to cut through the rich gravy.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Great dinner and perhaps the best fried chicken I've had in a long time. Go just for that but everything else was excellent as well. One of the best new restaurants I've tried in the Oakland restaurant boom!< /Review>

We had to wait for several parties to be seated before us, eventhough we had a reservation. Service was slow and unfriendly. What earns the two star rating though more than anything is that the waiter asked us 'what do think about the menu?' but when I expressed that I thought there weren't re enough vegeterian friendly brunch options he got super defensive. Food was only meh.< /Text>

Yummy!   The French toast, the fried chicken & biscuits (oh those stick-to-your-ribs bisquits!), not to mention the au gratin potatoes in the adorable little skillet!  The coffee was a bit light & blue-borrle-esque for my tastes, but the rest was amazing, with fantastic friendly service.< /text>

We didn't, went before a concert at the Fox last minute, and got stuck in the weird side building they have for spillover. Prepared to drop some dough on tasty food. They burger and fries chicken were fantastic! So were the sunchokes (my new favorite veggie).  The tequila drink was strong and perfect for some concert pre gaming. I'll be back here, but I'll make a reservation ahead of time and come back for more special occasions. My boyfriend and I super loud people, so this place might just be a little more formal than we are prepared to handle lol</Review></record>

Uni (sea urchin) & Salmon Roe, served on an Oyster. This is easily the most decadent seafood dish I've ever had. If you're still reading this hurry up and make a reso.

The menu is simple, but the flavours are complex, a lot of thought has gone I to the profiles of each dish.  If you're still reading this hurry up and make a reso.

These guys get a lunch crowd so If you're still reading this hurry up and make a reso.<//text>

<time>1516655901801< /time><Rate>3<//Rate><text>Stopped there during Oakland Restaurant Week with some colleagues. The special menu were items from their regular menu, at higher prices, since they included donuts...

The small restaurant was full so they took us doen a couple of doors to a separate room. While it was nice not to have the noise of the main dining room, it was cold and somewhat strange to be there by ourselves.

Service was efficient. The selections came out after an exceptionally long time. The food was good but not amazingly so. The waitress would not split the check so we ended up scrambling for eho paid for what,  which was unnecessary.

Doubt I'll come back with similar offerings all around the area and more pleasant staff and environments.<//text>< Pics>

A casual dining venue with a bar in an up and coming neighborhood. The fried chicken is a must try, something about the coating that makes it crispy and juicy. The oysters and fish were good too.< /Review>

I got the Salmon. It was delicious, and tiny. I also got the chocolate mousse for dessert, and it was one of the more amazing things I've had. Haven't tried the wine selection, but their whiskey selection covered some very delicious names (Lagavulin, for one).</Review>

I will drive across town (when I could be sleeping in) to ensure I get a table for brunch at Hopscotch. Or, I could simply make a reservation. It's worth it. Everything we've had here is worthwhile. First base burger,  fried chicken, hash, tonkatsu sandwich... for me, the standout is the kimchee fried rice with pork belly and jidoku eggs. Servers are quick and friendly; bartender is amazingly talented and just the right amount of chatty, ingredients are stellar and it all adds up to the pot o' gold experience. Post-brunch satisfaction has reached its zenith, thanks to Hopscotch.<//text>

<review>Wow, what a satisfying meal. We started with an avocado and seaweed salad featuring a perfectly ripe avocado, next had an amazing burger with beef tongue on top, and finished up with housemade sorbet. Great selection of wines and scotches too, along with pleasant peeps taking care of you. Top pick!</review>< user>

We were excited to come here. It went downhill the moment we arrived. The hostess quoted a 2 hour wait, with only 2 parties of 2 ahead of us. We decided to wait and were sitting at a table less than 20 minutes later. We ordered. The food finally arrived and was lackluster. Nothing too memorable. I would pass with so many other great spots in the area.< /Text>

Kind of overpriced but the food is pretty good. Closest brunch option to The Uptown. Packed around noon.< /Text>

Medium service, ran out of water and never was given more. Food was decent but not awesome or even good enough to make me want search for a parking spot to eat there again.<//Text>

Staff is friendly, small spot, burger is good, but the food and drinks are a bit pricey. Good spot for some lunch though. Might come back next time I'm in the area<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>The wait staff was pretty nice.  The food on the other hand was bland if not bad. I mean I make a better chicken and biscuits at home. Also, way too pricey $25 are you kidding me I can go to any chicken place a get Food for a family of 5 for that amount and I barely got enough for myself.  And if you are going to scramble eggs add salt and pepper or at least give me the option to do so. The greens tasted like foot and horseradish. The potato were OK I guess but they were served in a cast iron pan which would be ok except as we all know cast iron can not be washed the one I had been served had been the potato did have rusty after taste. Such a waste of money.< /Text>< pics>

This is a well-established white-tablecloth Italian fixture in the Rockridge restaurant zone, featuring fresh local ingredients. It's classy in terms of ambiance, service, and menu; the offerings are reasonably comprehensive, and just about everything is very good though not spectacular. The pasta dishes (primi) recommended.</Text>

I've been here several times for dinner and brunch and the food has always been delicious! They also have great options for beer, wine, whiskey and cocktails. One thing Hopscotch can work on is their service. Checking in is always awkward and wait time for food, after being seated, is long.< /Review>

<Text>The staff was attentive, friendly and worked well as a team. I wish the food worked well. Our party was 3 and not one of us gave the food high marks.

The uni in the Yonsei Oysters were undetectable. The oyster and salmon roe overpowered the Uni.

I couldn't taste the tongue in the 1st Base Burger. Luckily it was served cut in half and I picked out the tongue to eat it plain.

Happy hour beer was served in smaller glasses, so not a real happy hour price.

I did enjoy the desserts: Mochi Cake and Butterscotch Pudding.

I had high hopes as the ingredients were intriguing. I probably won't be going back as my try list for the Bay Area is pretty long, but I would give it a try again if someone asked me to go - only because the staff was great and the menu looked great. The food wasn't bad, just didn't the high price.< /Text><Response>None</Response>< user_id>

It's wonderful to dine in a restaurant where there are no strangers. In Hopscotch, a less than 40 seat bistro meets diner mid-priced Japanese‑inspired restaurant in "Uptown Oakland", no one is a stranger. It's steps aways from the Fox Theater and, with a few more steps, the Paramount Theater. A new "stranger" is greeted by Jenny and feed by Kyle (co-owners) only to be most welcomed by Jason the mixologist behind the oversized blue white marbled counter. And there was no "bottom two" ingredients deleted from his complex cocktails. Of which are enough to fill several menus; check it out: our two menus didn't match when it came to the cocktail list. And that kind of says it about Hopscotch. Worth checking out.<//text>

Awesome little spot. I tried the oyster with uni and roe and it was delicious and refreshing. I thought that the uni would overpower every flavor but it was not the case: I was able to test and appreciate every ingredient. For entree I opted for the pork belly benedicts on challah bread. Very tasty! The yusu hollandaise was something else and the eggs very fresh. The side salad was great. Not a big fan of their potatoes.

My friend loved their wasabi Virgin Mary.

I'll definitely come back!<//Text>

Even with the expansion, which seems to be mostly for private dining, it's hard to score a walk-in here. And with good reason -- the food and cocktails are outstanding.</review>

I finally got to try this Oakland resto that everyone raves about. I went for lunch at got the fried chicken. I generally prefer white meat, but they served it dark, and it was delicious! :D I also love the white beans they serve on the side. I just wish they had more of them. I got the Duck Fat chips with aioli, but those were just okay. I'd definitely come back and try dinner.</Text>

I was out working my 2nd job for my family and wife who was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and was directed pick up an order for the 1st time . I was informed that there was some discrepancy in payment and the credit card paid all except $0.45 and as the waitress begin to tell me politely the manager jumps in and immediately starts attacking the company I work for and me. He was very rude, he cut me off before I could even begin to talk. I couldn't even get half of one letter out of my mouth before I was met with such a harsh and angry attitude . I felt very uncomfortable. I just paid the money out of my pocket so that I continue having a great day .  This being my first time at this place I was excited about coming back as a customer as I sat there enjoying the music and look of this bar until I was met with very biased, angry, and what felt like some sort of secret Prejudice from management only . The staff there seem pretty nice but I would not patronize this place nor will I tell my friends about it and we have a large social media network and at least 40% live here in the bay area.  The prices are not worth the service from the Management Staff.</text>

A charming quaint local Oakland spot with wonderful food.  We sat at the bar and ordered what the bartender recommended which included beer steamed clams, kanpachi sashimi, and the duck liver pate and opted for the fried chicken for dinner.  All were quite good and wonderfully prepared.  The service was attentive and good.  The decor is that of a friendly neighborhood bistro.  I called a half an hour before we arrived asking if there was availability at the bar.  We had to wait about five minutes when we got there but then a spot cleared up for us.  It's nice that they have a few chairs outside and it's a pleasant place to wait and take in the city on a warm night.

We will definitely be back.< /review>

Pros:
- trendy atmosphere
- decently fast service

Cons:
- food was average and rather forgettable
- I couldn't really find the "Asian" influence in the dishes
- extremely crowded and cramped
- over-hyped on Yelp

Bottom line: I won't be returning. But other diners seem to have good experiences, so maybe I was just unlucky.</review>

<Review>Hopscotch can be a very conflicting experience.  Brunch is great; dinner is lackluster.  Service is great; then it sucks.  One dish can be amazing; the next dish can be a dud.  I've been here a few times, and always leave scratching my head, wondering how I should feel.  Here are some takeaways:

First of all, the place is TINY.  I think maybe eight tables and a bar with eight stools.  It can be very crowded, so factor that into your plans.

Brunch is very solid.  The fried chicken is out of this world, maybe the best I've had in California.  The Bloody Mary is fantastic.  They'll even do a solid French 75, which isn't always the best experience if the bartender doesn't know their stuff.  If you sit at the bar, the bartenders are always pleasant and your service (and your cocktails) will be great.  Get the donuts, you won't regret it.

A few days ago we went in for a Christmas special "whole lamb platter," which consisted of a few different cuts of lamb, broccoli romanesco, cauliflower puree, and cornbread.  It sounded good in the e-mail, but the dinner was just... underwhelming.  For $65 we got a "portion for two" that was generously made for one, and immediately regretted not ordering something else.  All of the food was fine, but none of it was special.

The service was also pretty bad.  When we asked for cocktail pairings instead of wine pairings, the waitress basically said, "Um, well, the wine is really good. Are you sure you don't want wine?" and then offered no help when it came to cocktails.  In a place that actually has a great bar, you'd think they would be more willing to talk cocktails.  We felt like we were being pushed hard towards the wine pairings in a gross, upselly-type way, and it was a bummer.

I keep thinking I should go back to Hopscotch and give them another try, because for every negative point, there's a positive point.  Really and truly, I've had some great bites and drinks here.  But it's just not solid enough to stay in my thoughts or stomach for long, especially with so many great restaurants in the Oakland/Berkeley area.

Hopscotch needs to up its game.  There are some ballers around here.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I enjoyed the Unagi (eel) & Cucumber starter, the Greens & Shrooms starter, and the Chika Chika Slang (or something) cocktail. Everything tasted great, unique, and high quality. Portions were small for their price but probably still worthy. I would have loved some carbs on the side; I wanted potatoes at the end... hah! The bartender was cool and the vibes were good. I found that the food overall was pricey yet yummy and a great experience for those certain occasions.< /review>

My partner and I started with the Yonsei Oyster and the fries. The oyster came with uni, salmon roe, and citrus soy. I didn’t taste a citrus element, the soy was light like a dashi, but it was surprisingly really good in a decadent way and it felt refreshing in the Oakland heat. If I had known how delicious they were, I would have ordered a dozen of these!

The fries were crispy and it came with a Frenso chili aioli that was creamy, a touch spicy, and it’s something every fatty like me would enjoy.

I ordered the First Base Burger and it came with a house ground chuck, griddled beef tongue, pickled onions, and sesame aioli with a side of Kennebec chips. You can also add bacon or cheddar and I opted for the latter. It’s not a homerun, but still exciting in its own way. I asked for medium rare and received a rare patty but I found it to tender and juicy. The aioli was sparse so I can’t tell you what it tasted like, but the pickled onion added a nice contrast to the beef and the sweet bun.

My partner ordered the chicken club and it came with lettuce, cabbage, bacon, tomato, and fried chicken. It was simple but the fried chicken took it up a notch. I only had a bite but have to get it the next time we visit.

Items do not appear as described but we had a good meal here.<//Text>

Came here with a friend for brunch on a Sunday morning around 10:45. Since it was still early, we were seated right away, outside on the patio per our request. Service was wonderful and quick, and they made some nice suggestions for brunch, although their menu is really limited and very much Asian-inspired.

We started our meal with a carafe of Mimosas for $15, which equates to about 1.5 drinks per person. My friend had the kimchi fried rice with miso marinated jidori eggs. We hadn't expected her rice to be so moist and wet, more on the side of risotto than fried rice, though still good. I had the pork belly eggs benedict, which came with a side salad and skillet potatoes. The Benedict was good, though really rich with the creaminess of the egg yolk, hollandaise sauce, and pork belly fat. The side frisee salad had a nice tart vinegrette. The skillet potatoes came out pipping hot on a small cast iron skillet, though it was rather creamy and cheesy, more like potatoes au gratin than the skillet homefries I was expecting for brunch. Since the pork belly eggs benedict was already so rich, the potatoes seemed like excess. I wish I had gotten fruit as a side instead to even the meal out!

Street parking was easy to find. We found out afterwards that their is also a second half to the restaurant two doors down, so there's definitely more seating than the main location shows.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Their brunch is amazingly sweet and they even have a unique way of preparing their food. There are seats inside and out. The quiet environment is lovely. I recommend that resto to all, especially at brunch hours!

(Original)
Brunch zao ni ya maajabu yani tamu sana na hata wana mtindo ya kipekee ya kuandaa chakula chao.  Kuna viti ndani na nje.  Mazingira tulivu ni ya kupendeza.  Napendekeza hiyo resto kwa wote, hasa saa za brunch!</Text>

I'd love to hear what we can do better.  Please feel free to be in touch directly jenny@hopscotchoakland.com.\nSincerely,\nJenny Schwarz, Owner"}< /Response>
