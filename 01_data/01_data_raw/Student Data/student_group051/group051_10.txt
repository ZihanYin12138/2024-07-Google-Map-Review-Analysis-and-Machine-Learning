the food is good, but the tortilla chips are so hard to chew on that you could break a tooth easily, they need to do something about it, I hope someone from management sees this comment.</Text>

The covered patio is an excellent place to enjoy the awesome food they serve here! Minerva, my server, was courteous & attentive.  I liked that she let me eat my meal without being intrusive yet she was there at the precise moment when I did need assistance.  A huge plus in my book.  The cortaditos here are a caffeine addict's dream.  :)< /Review>

Pricing on the other hand is a dollar or two more then other competitors. A simple chicken enchiladas meal will run you 18.99. It's good but still pricey. This is my 3rd visit and it's safe to say, I'll be back for a fourth.< /text>< Pictures>

Food not so tasty this type of restaurant is more to go hang out and drink with friends than to enjoy good food,  and not even the drinks are good enough I ordered a piña colada and never even tasted no alcohol in it I drink it like a smoothie.</review>

I initially ordered the Chicken Enchiladas in Mole...if you don't like SWEET mole this dish is not for you...I ended up exchanging for Milanesa Chicken which was good.

Price is a little up there and the food was average, but the service provided was great.

Special thank you to our servers Gabriela & Ruth who did not skip a beat.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeDWLy1vNBE4guC0qtMK3ZK_a-2xH5Q_oWPweq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2cdd17598b38d:0xe250d3bda255cc8a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

1st visit after opening, not a bad place, good sea food specially... Bar section is very lively and it has an overall good atmosphere. I will definitely visit again soon. Prices are a bit above average, but portions match the price in my opinion.</Review>

<text>Very happy with the service... Food was excellent got the happy hour special #3, beer and 4 street tacos, there was so much meat I was able to make 4 extra tacos... My wife got the sopes tio, very good portion... We ordered the habanero mango wing, very saucy and crunchy, to our surprise it came with 3 onion rings 👍. All in all very good experience.!!!<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP63tS-21IFwLrD6npm9bKDdu_vK-mR6p8PHLBa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxOknLuvvnrFyP0l7AwGfrKIkG3Gl9S1FlgWsi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

The food, atmosphere, and service are pretty damn amazing.  Stopped in really quick just to check out the sports bar area and ended up staying for lunch.  Our server, Lore, was on fantastic and on point!  Will definitely be bringing family and friends here to watch games and have a good time!</review>

They need to improve their training techniques for their waitresses. Once you are served they no longer bother to go to the tables to check how your food came out, and or if you need anything else. They don't acknowledge you until you call their attention. They also didn't bother to ask if it was our first time there since they just opened. They didn't bother to go over the menu or ask if We had any questions in regards to the menu. Hopefully they can work on improving these flaws to make this place more welcoming so they can gain returning customer's.< /review>

Not to mention the remodeling of the building is gorgeous! You can bring the whole family or just come to party and watch some sports! Excited to come here after work for happy hour<//review>< Name>

<review>I Love their food, amazing new installations.
December 2nd 2019 around 3pm
The service is the worst, after 10 minutes of waiting for someone to take my order I actually request one of the waiters to send someone, 10 minutes after still nobody took my order. I got up disappointed and left the place the worst part is that one of the managers came after me and grabbed my arm thinking that I was leaving without pain 👎</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>I hate being the one to post a bad review when I went to this location with High hopes to be satisfied and have a new place for breakfast with my family, how sad that we were so disappointed. The food was decent but we received horrible service. Not the waiter specifically I think she really tried her best, but they don’t have a good system to keep attentive to the customers. We waited 45 mins and nice seated to get a glass of water and have someone ask us what we wanted to eat. Then waited another hour for our food only to come see they got two of our orders wrong. It was all sour from that point. We won’t be going back anytime soon, how sad. Very disappointed< /Review><date>1571599619380</date>< rating>

This restuarant is decorated more than I thought. It is beautiful inside.
Half of the facility seems to be dedicated to "club/bar" part of the restaurant that is not visible from the dining area (kid friendly).
They accommodated for a party of nine for us which is good, as some places have stationary tables and aren't able to.
The food was incredibly delicious.
Mexican style dishes as well as seafood dishes, and many breakfast plates as well on the menu.
I have to say it is the best Mexican eatery I have found in Downey.
I do want to mention it can easily add up to be very pricey. Average price was between $15-$20 per meal.
I had Pescado Habernero (whole fried fish), and it was so large of a meal, there was left over. I left satisfied and happy.
The service was great and I have no complaints about it at all.
Pricey but worth it if you have the funds to spare.
Great job with the location and restaurant El Pescador of Downey!< /review>

<review>We were pretty exited to have our Friday night dinner and try this new pescador. Beautiful place, drinks were good. However we had a horrible experience with our waitress and our food. I had order an empapelado and my girlfriend had order 2 shrimp 🍤 tostadas, the empapelado came out right away, but we waited 30 min for the food we ordered. Waitress came by to tell us that our food was coming out,  we continued waiting and when the food arrived they brought my girlfriends food (tacos ) that was not what she order. At the end I was the only one that ate because we were not going to wait another who knows how long for our correct order. Honestly very disappointed. The waitress didn’t even apologize instead she was blaming the cook for her mistake, and tried to justify by stating that the table next to us had their order wrong as well ! We didn’t care about other people !</review>< Pictures>

This was my first time here and was a very enjoyable experience. They have a check in waitlist that you are able to view your place in line. The outdoor seating area was very nice and the heating lamps were a plus. The drinks and food were amazing and would definitely come back again.< /review>

Best quality and value fish around. Must buy in bulk. Bring cash. Not known for their customer service but they make up for it with their product</Text>

<Text>They were dishonest about the weight of the seafood. I bought a King Crab and the worker there said it was 6 pounds on average. When it was on the sclae it showed 8.05 pounds with a box and the women there said they would tare the weight of the box and counted it as 7 pounds. Guess what? I arrived home and found the box was near 2 pounds (I tared weight of the box's base)! That was $40 more revenue for them. Shame on them!</Text>< pictures>

The case was closed, but they sold the Lobster was fresh. When I go them home to cook them. 60% of the Lobster's were dead. I have bought solid fresh fish from K&C in the past, but was very disappointed with their quality with this purchase.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808fcc88062081e7:0x1b345426e1f0e514< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Today paid $100 with change expected to be $40. I got in my truck to leave and one of the clerks flagged me down and we handled the $40 change situation.

My second or third time here this week.  Oysters...big</review>

<Text>I called them on Dec, 23rd around 11am. asked them if they have box of lobster available, the guy told me the shipment will come in between 3-4pm and ask him how much per box? he said $200 I've been to this place a few time I usually paid $170-$180 but when I got there at 4:30pm and waited inline for 20 minutes and ask for 2 boxes, the short bald headed guy said he only have 1 box and it's will cost me $230 I told him I called around 11am you said $200 and I ask him why he said because he had to pay high cost for the shipment. Which is BS, so I ask him give me the 1 box you had, he went inside and came back and told me he's ran out of the last box of lobster and told me to come back the next day and I told him I can't because I drove from Stockton and for some reason he sold a box for $230. I never ever do business with this place ever again.<//Text><rate>1<//rate>< response>

Best place to get seafood and prepare it any way you want. It's very easy to miss this place. Got Kumamoto Oysters @ $80 for 5 dozens. Oysters were kept carefully and workers there were kind enough to give me a bag so the box wouldn't leak.<//Review>

Nice selection and prices - box of 60 Kumamoto oysters for $80. A lot of the employees don't speak great English.l but the woman working in the front was helpful. I was in and out in 5 minutes.</Review>

<text>I was recommended by a local foodie to try K & C Seafood Wholesale for the freshest oyster in the world. No kidding. After trying them on the grill, I don't want oysters from anyone else. I live on the Gulf Coast, I don't think I could find someone this fresh like K & C.

Fresh is not just an adjective. It's a requirement for all seafood vendors. I'm glad to say that K & C has met this requirement. The live oysters and other seafood items were air flown from the sources.

It's like I'm in the seafood heaven. I would hit up this place again when I come back to San Jose Bay Area next time.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< review>
On Father’s Day, I called ahead and they said they have everything. I went there and wait in line 30 minutes, then they said out of lobster. The guy was very rude. I came here again on July 4th and got a box of lobster for much more than what is sold at the supermarket. The lobsters are small and pricey. The guys selling them were so rude and very pushy. The price changes all the time depending how many people are there. Very dishonest business. Don’t waste your time here, buy it at the supermarket you will get bigger and more quality seafood and better service. I wish i can file a complain about them not wearing proper facemasks and not following COVID-19 guidelines.< /review>

Avoid! Seller not honest! Always add additional weight in price calculation. For example, scale reads 10lb, you get charged for 13lb. I always get charged about 25% more than the actual price. I once told them, hey you are not inputting the correct weight, but they always have excuse, like the unit price is now higher, etc. Seller is shameless to lie to get every dollar more from buyers in every single transaction.< /Text>

Hidden gem at the north end of San Jose!  This place is incredible!  The sheer variety of live seafood they carry!  Everything seemed to be reasonably priced and very fresh, still kicking in fact!  I got Dungeness Crab, razor clams, spot prawns and little neck clams for a Memorial Day paella, all on Memorial Day afternoon! Quite a fun place to go.  They have some live lobsters in there that are massive.  Claws the size of your hand!  Can't wait to go back and get some for the next BBQ!<//Text>

Greetings fellow lobster enthusiasts,

Have you ever heard of the “soup’s Nazi?”.  Well, this wholesale-seafood business is run by a lobster Nazi.   I believe this business is likely run by a middle age Asian couple;  the women and the man seem to both speak fluent Vietnamese, Chinese, and English.  I arrived Sunday (December 24th 2017)  morning to wait in line to purchase my share of lobsters and dungeness crabs for my Christmas-day-family meal.  Paid my $200 in cash - because they only take cash -  for the box of lobster, no receipt was provided. I then told the man in charge of the line, likely the male proprietor, that I am also interested in the possibility of purchasing crabs as well;  so he told my mom and  I that we are welcome go to inside and look at the crabs and lobster in their live seafood tanks.  Being price conscious buyers,  we inquired about the price of the lobsters in the various tanks as well as the price of the crabs.  Having realized that the crabs price were a couple of dollars more expensive than our local Oriental supermarkets, and that we already have enough seafood/lobster for the family meal,  we decided not to buy any and started making our way out the store.

At the entrance of the doorway, to my unpleasant surprise,  we ran into the male proprietor again and he was extremely angry, he told us to get the heck out of his store and that we are not supposed to being asking his staffs any questions; he was so mad, for reasons not known to me, that he was forming at the mouth and used impolite language on us, the idea was to humiliate us into leaving the premises.  Since he had a couple boxes in his hands he decided to push us out of the entrance of his store with  his boxes.  He was treating my mom and I , his customers, as though we are dogs and/or beggar that dared to enter his business.

This being America, I know my rights and stood my ground.  So he back off a bit, I told him I had like a word with the female proprietor because we were in the the store just the weekend before to check out the place.  So I walked over to her and asked her if she would be so kind as to give us a discount a on my purchase today, because the weekend before, we  spent $40  on a  on 2 small lobsters  and 3 crabs that were preserved on ice and 2 of 3 crabs turned out to be spoiled.   ... don’t by buy any crab that is preserved on ice.  Two of the 3 crabs were spoiled as my wife and I found after she wasted precious time preparing them. She told me to toss them out  but I decided to try one of them as it did not seem to taste bad, and my wife wasted a couple of good hours in the kitchen preparing them.  Needless to say, my guts told me it was a mistake that evening, had a small case of food poisoning.

[Trimmed content due to character limit exceeded]

Moral of my story.  By all means,  refrain from doing business with K.C. Food Wholesale, because this business have no respect for their customers as I have experienced and described above.  If you decide to continue doing business with them or giving this business a try,  stay the heck away from anything that they preserved on ice.   Because they had be glad to sale you spoiled products, willingly risk giving you food  poisoning, on account of making profit.  And if you have the audacity to confront them about the bad product they sold you, they will make fun of you, lob verbal  abuses on you for good measure, then throw you out of their store as if you are beggars.   Ask for receipts for your records when you buy from K.C Food Wholesale;  so that if you do get food poisoning from consuming their seafood, you will have evidence to show the city of San Jose Food Safety Inspector.

Seafood aficionados,  beware of K.C Food Wholesale rotten business practice.  Demand that they treat you, their customers, with respect.  Because as it currently stand, this business seems to have no concern regarding your physical health nor your well being in consuming their products.  Nor any respect to your mental health when doing business with them.

Regards,
Dmitri

Oysters. Love 'em. Shuck 'em myself, eat 'em raw, with at most a squeeze of lemon. Around here, you can get oysters all over the place. Generic Chesapeake Bay or pacific oysters at any asian market, 2 dozen at a time. Better quality oysters, at prices approaching highway robbery, from most Whole Foods locations. Or you can go to K&C. Kumamotos and Shigokus at $60/5 dozen. Olympias (120 in a bag) by request. Fresh pacifics of the highest quality, ranging in size from delicate to giant grilling sizes, at wholesale prices...

... and then there's the giant lobsters, live scallops, clams, mussels...< /Text>

<review>Everything fresh! I work very close, and Mateo's is my go to place by default. For a sandwich or a treat, fruit, fresh juice, ice cream, popsicles, whatever! I love it!

Mateo, thanks for finally coming to the westside. I just can't get enough of the fruit bars, sandwiches, drinks, and bionicos. The servers here are nicer than other 3 locations. The only downside is no parking. I circled around a couple of times around the block to find a meter. The music is always very nice. See you tomorrow for my vampiro #1! Orale' Mateo's! Update: just learned that Mateo passed away last week in Mexico... I'm so sad. I knew Mateo for over 15 years! What a delightful person he was, so generous and caring. I once told him that I did not know the taste of pitaya, and he gave me a whole paleta (bar). I was hooked on pitaya since. I think heaven wanted some awesome bionicos and fruit ice cream/bars. RIP mi amigo Mateo. We'll miss you, and thanks for letting us get to know how wonderful real fruit products, including drinks and ice cream, as well as sandwiches and bionicos. Love what you did for us all while you were with us, my friend. Adios.< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>As someone who's mildly lactose intolerant, the broad range of water based nieves is a game changer. The fruit nieves here are so incredibly strongly-flavored, and I love it! Also the kiwi paletas are a standout. Favourite flavors are probably the strawberry and the passionfruit, but it's hard to go wrong. SO likes the horchata and the walnut (he does not suffer from my dairy issues).

Recently, I also learned that I'm a big fan of the sandwiches here -- bean paste on a sandwich is something I didn't know that I was missing, but made my life much much tastier.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
If you're looking for delicious ice cream in a hot day. This is the place to go. They have the most delicious ice cream ever. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. Ice cream tastes healthy and natural. They have some Mexican flavors. But if you try them you won't regret it. Another wonderful treat you can try from there are the bionicos. Every time I go there I have to buy one. The employees and manager are very friendly.  Last time I was there with my kids my youngest son threw the biggest tantrum ever that I took him outside and the manager was concern he came outside to check up on us. He asked my son what was wrong and gave him a scoop of ice cream which put a smile on my kids face. So definitely a kid friendly place. By the way place is so colorful and cute that kids will love it.<//Review>

<Text>Really happy there is a new location close to home, I don't have to go to Culver City anymore just for Ice Cream. But anyways if this is your first time I will let you know that this is the BEST Ice cream shop in LA. The flavors and texture are amazing and also very delicious. Just note it can get packed. The prices are fair and they even have fruit and veggie related drinks. COME CHECK IT OUT!!!! ☺<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>I wish I could give this place zero stars, and for only one reason.  They ALWAYS close anywhere from a half hour to 45 minutes before their listed time.  The number of times that I and my wife have planned on being their 10 minutes before closing to just pick up some ice cream to take home, only to get there and have it already be closed and often having other potential customers looking in through the windows disappointed as well, is insane.  If you say you close at 9pm, close at 9pm, not 8:45pm.  It's that simple.  If you said you were going to close at 8:45, we'd come at 8:30.  But when you say 9pm (on the door and on the PHONE mind you), and you're closed at 8:45, and I'm there at 8:50 and SEE PEOPLE inside cleaning up looking at me and not letting me in, then I and all the other people that I've seen coming at 8:50ish (because guess what, people make plans based on what you say you'll do, i.e., close at 9pm) will take our business to other ice cream places.  It's super unprofessional and you've already lost a TON of business because of it, and will continue to do so.  It's simple guys.</text><rate>1<//rate>< pictures>

<Text>Chris and Luis are very good what they love to do on the job site. I recommend any paint and body work done to the Vehicles. Mine 2020 corolla hatchback got finished within 2 weeks as they said.

This is my second time bringing my car to Luis Body Shop. They consistently provided excellent service and great price. The job they did on my Porsche Mecan is perfect. I had a big dent on my driver side door and my mirror also got scratched. My car looks like brand new now. Also, since I don't want to claim insurance and need to pay out of my own pocket, they tried to save me money but didn't give up the quality. Highly recommend!!< /text>

Luis Body Shop, you are the best!!!  I put a *huge* scratch and dent down the back half of my roommate's car.  Luis Body Shop gave me a great price, fixed it quickly, and you can't even tell anything happened when you look at it now.  Because of Luis Body Shop, I'm still allowed to use my roommate's car.  Oh-- and he even washed the outside and vaccuumed the inside-- awesome!!<//Review>

I had the best experience here! Everyone here is so friendly and informative. I took my car in for repairs during this crazy pandemic and they managed to get my car back to me within 3 days. A1 work as well, and they really cleaned up my car which I appreciate. You can also track your service online which is great, and they are super responsive! Thanks for taking care of me and my car, will 100% return!< /review>

A friend recommended Kirill for my automotive needs.
I've serviced 6 of my family's cars here.  From simple oil change and tire replacement to engine diagnostics and engine/supercharger installation I can rely on KSH to do the job right and at reasonable rates.  I will drive from San Mateo to Los Angeles for their great service.</Text>

Perfect in every way! Got 5 quotes for a slightly dented left fender on my GF's Volvo s40.  Super simple damage, not bad, but wanted to get it fixed.  The 5 quotes I got prior to Avenue ranged from 850-1400.  All involved buying a new fender as they said it couldn't be straightened.  Most involved blending the door and hood to the fender paint requiring significantly more work.</review>

JP Auto Body Shop went beyond great service giving me peace of mind and dealing with multiple complicated insurance claims on my behalf. Not only did they do a great job (about every panel on my car had been vandalized with dents), I received my car detailed and spotless inside and out and in a timely manner.<//text>

The team at Chapparone Auto Body did a great job on my 2006 Cayman S after getting backed into in a parking lot.  Mark Jr. was very friendly, knowledgeable and clear about things.  They took care of the work quickly and flawlessly.  There is no better shop around in my opinion.

Thanks a million.< /Review>

John provided some helpful suggestions for getting a used bumper.  I had them repair the front fender, which I thought was beyond repair.  They did an amazing job.< /review>

Fantastic customer service, extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Offered a complimentary rental for five days because my insurance wouldn't cover. Even gave me a ride home when I dropped my car off.< /Review>

Very beautiful and peaceful church hidden in the Residencial neighborhood of Atwater village off of the 5 Freeway and Colorado exit.

The church is open to public and even in this crazy time where the fake narrative of Covid-19 has destroyed businesses, families and closed schools and churches, this church offers the peace for God and prayer. Be blessed. God loves you< /Text>

My first and only experience at Sunmed Health was not as pleasant as the reviews I've seen posted. The intake staff was poised and brought me into the waiting room as normal to fill out the new patient information  documents. "Good so far." Once the forms were complete, the nurse returned to record my medical history and take the payment.  All seemed well.  Sometime later, the doctor entered and began with a series of questions that made it quite apparent he had not spoken to or discussed any of the information just documented with the nurse.  After several minutes of reiterating what I'd just spent the previous forty minutes documenting,  to much discomfort ended the consult. Normally, in these encounters where a  patient is seeking professional services from a physician,  is it not  the physicians responsibility initiate the warranted customer service that will create the synergy for a potential business relationship. Not the patient.
Seemed very disinterested in my business.<//text>

I think that, no matter how great the doctor is, they MUST have a great staff backing them up.
Dr. Sunio's staff are very friendly and prompt. The online messaging system works really well, and they have been super accommodating with my busy schedule.
He is knowledgeable and encouraging. I'd recommend him to anyone who feels they need a physician that is honest and genuine.<//Review>

Not to mention the office when you walk in whatever  season it may  be is always beautifully decorated welcoming you :) or the beautiful fish tanks in waiting rooms that give you a serene sense as your waiting to be seen by Doctor .
I would highly recommend Dr. Sunio to family, friends or all who are looking for a good  Doctor. Dr Sunio and his staff  are one of the Best Doctors & staff here in Visalia .</Review>< Pics>

<review>I've just completed my first six week with Dr. Sunio and his amazing staff. I lost 24.9 lbs at six weeks with no gimmicks,  I have not felt deprived or hungry.  With the knowledge and guidance that I have received on the Sunmed Health and Weight management program I am finally losing the unhealthy weight that has caused me to miss out on family events and has contributed to health problems.
I recommend everyone struggling with weight and health problems caused by being morbidly obese to make a first appointment, ask questions,  and commit to a new you.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

It is nice knowing you have a Doctor that listens, and hears you. Then talks with you to solve your issue. He has done more for my health care and improving it .

I should say that his staff and nurses are some of the best I have seen in many years. The ease of getting an appointment and when I had a problem and needed to get in fast, I was set up to come right down. 5 Stars for his Staff as well.< /Text>

Dr Sunio has a been both myself and my husband’s doctor for several years. Never has he failed to be there for us quickly.  He knows our typical ailments and remembers even where we travel and what we enjoy doing. He keeps us healthy and encourages us to be active and to  exercise.  He listens to our preferences on what we feel is important   Never makes us feel inadequate but always encourages us with the importance of doing what he believes to be the right way to a longer and more active life span.<//review>

The receptionist is the kindest soul ever met.   She always attends to whoever needs, never distracted, attentive, and loving.  If you want the absolute best of care, make an appointment.

I followed Dr. Sunio from Visalia Medical Clinic to his new practice at Sunmed Health and Weight Management. Dr. Sunio is very thorough and personable during my visits. I feel he really listens to what I have to say and gives honest feedback.

The entire staff at Sunmed Health and Weight Management are helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.</Review>

He is the most comprehensive,compassionate,knowledgeable doctor I have known and since I am a registered nurse for over 30 years, I do understand medicine and providing excellent diagnosis and care.  Just as a side note, since he has added weight loss to his resume, I have lost over 30 lbs..because of his counseling during my visits.  You will never regret choosing Dr Sunio!<//text>< Pics>

<text>Dr. Sunio and his staff are very friendly and very informative. I joined their CMWL (Controlled Med Wt Loss) program mid Oct 2017 because my primary dr’s office at that time didn’t offer anything like this. CMWL is a non surgical program and as long as you’re dedicated-you WILL lose weight! I started their “Fast Track” program as I was anxious to lose wt asap. Fast Track involves CMWL food and for some, possibly medication. I felt this was the best way for me to “detox” the bad foods out. Dr. Sunio suggested weekly appts & said not to be discouraged if at my 1st weekly check in, I didn’t lose anything as most patients don’t. To my surprise (and his) I had lost 7 pounds! Their scale is not your regular drs office or home scale either, it weighs your electrical resistance, water wt, BMI, muscle/fat, wt of ea arm/leg & torso. Each appt since, I’ve lost anywhere from a few pounds up to 12! Please note, each follow up/weigh in wasn’t always weekly and if you’re not motivated & do not follow the plan as laid out for you; don’t expect these same results. I am eating regular foods and now read food labels. To date; I’ve lost almost 55 pounds and KEPT it off. THANK YOU DR. SUNIO AND SUNMED STAFF!!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I seriously can’t thank Next Generation Peat control enough. Words can’t describe how thankful I am for their wonderful friendly staff and service. Mitchell was very nice and assured me that all the bugs would be taken care of. And sure enough not even a week later all the ants are gone and other bugs. Previously, we had another company come spray twice and never saw results like Next Generation. I cannot wait for my next service to thank them in person.< /Text>

I found a hidden gem when I competitively sourced for service through Yelp and selected Next Generation Pest Control.  I have found them thorough in their response for service and very professional. The Technician that came out to my home, Mitchell Colvin, was friendly and informative.  I am happy that I chose to have a monthly service contract for nine months out of the year with this company.< /text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>The Team at Next Generation Pest Control came over an installed pigeon spikes to keep these birds 🐦 away. I’m hopeful that the rest of these 2 story homes in my neighborhood follow suit and do the same, so these pigeons can find a new home elsewhere. No more bird droppings to deal with on my driveway or front entry door walkway.
Thanks to Next Generation Pest Control.
Thanks again Team.<//text>< Date>

Customer service was great, kind, and friendly. I have seen a huge improvement after the very first visit. I just bought a home and was seeing lots of spiders and cockroaches. I am keeping their service to maintain control of these pests.< /review>

<Text>I would recommend Next Generation to anyone having an existing pigeon problem or anyone having solar panels installed.  I had my solar panels installed two years ago and, word got out, and the pigeons began showing up on my roof.  It got progressively worse.  This spring they had pretty much taken over.  I talked to a few different companies before calling Next Generation.  I was impressed by their knowledge and the solution they were offering.  Plus, the cost was very reasonable... I was not disappointed!  The entire perimeter of my panels are now protected by a black PVC-coated galvanized steel mesh, and the panels, the roof and the gutters have all been thoroughly cleaned up... Thank you, Stephen, and thank you, Geraldo!!<//Text>< user_id>

They definitely live by as many visits as is needed to get the job done. They have been out about six times in two weeks. Not because they missed anything but because we have called with new issues being caught that were not known initially. Always seems they make it out in the same day or next business day. Even took our call when they were technically closed to schedule an appointment. Staff are very knowledgeable and professional. Highly recommend.<//Review>< pictures>

I was dealing with pigeons after having solar panels installed.  I put in a request on line and not even 5 minutes later I got a call,  he scheduled me an appointment came over within the same week. Sanitized my roof,  got rid of the nasty poop, and put up protective gear that prevents the pigeons from returning.  It was so worth it, I had been loosing it with the noise of the pigeons every day and going out to my backyard seeing and smelling the mess had gotten draining.  Thank you Next Generation Pest control for your timeliness and  professionalism!< /review>

<review>I can't say enough good things about this company. I asked a question via the website and recieved an email back that day answering my question.  In that email I set up for them to come out the very next day.  Stephen came out exactly on time and even texted to let me know he was on his way.  He was very pleasant and walked around my property to get a good look at all the pests we were dealing with.  We decided that he would come back the very next day to take care of all that I had.
The next day him and Cesar came,  with the text beforehand telling me exactly the time they would be pulling up. Both Stephen and Cesar were polite and very thorough.  They even got rid of ALL the spiderwebs on the exterior of my house!! Their price is great and I am very excited to get help dealing with all the pests I have living in the country.
You will not be disappointed!
Update after 1 week,  no webs anywhere! We couldn't go 1 day without webs.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

We've been using Next Generation Pest Control for over a year for our monthly service and wasps treatment they go above and beyond any pest control company I have ever used.  We had an issue with bird mites coming into our office from nests they were building outside the door and they showed up the same day assessed the situation sprayed the property inside and out and came back the following day to spray again to make sure the mites did not spread.  They also recommended installing a bird netting under the eves of the building so that the birds could not keep coming back and building nests.  Within a few days they had the materials and installed the netting system to keep all birds out and we have had no issues since.  Next generation is reliable and has a great knowledgeable/friendly staff I would highly recommend using them they aren't your average run of the mill pest control company who shows up does a mediocre spray and leaves.  They take care of their customers right.<//review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Very professional and great service! Way better than our previous pest control provider. They initially came out for a bat problem, but noticed other areas where rodents could enter. They took care of the bats, the entry points in our garage/around our house where rodents could enter, and sprayed for insects. We also had thick weeds they were able to spray & take care of. I also noticed their spray method & techniques to be a lot better than our previous pest control provider & felt that they covered everything as opposed to our previous provider seemed to do the bare minimum. I also like that they text you when they’re on their way. We signed up for their bi-monthly spray services. Very happy with our service and definitely would recommend!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>It's not everyday you wake up to a dove in your chimney.  I wasn't sure who to call so I filled out a request through Home Advisor.  Within 10 minutes I was contacted by Next Generation Pest Control who set up a time to come do an inspection.  They gave me a time window between 10am and 12pm.  The gentleman (sorry, I forget the name) was knocking on my door at 10am sharp!  After a quick inspection inside my old 1950s chimney he determined that he would have to attempt to remove the Dove safely from the top down (there was no way to get it from the bottom up).  He went to his truck and constructed a device that would allow him to remove the dove from approx. 15 feet above!  with a little patience it as a success!  He safely freed the bird which both I and the dove are thankful for.  Maybe most impressive about this experience?  There was NO CHARGE!  I'm not sure why and I'm sure it doesn't happen everyday, especially for someone who had never used their services before.  I am so impressed with this company and will absolutely do business with them again.  Thanks again, Next Generation!<//Text>< Pictures>

This was our first time using a pest control service and we’re very impressed. Jon Watson came out to our house and explained exactly what needed to be done to solve our ant/ bug problem. He did such an amazing job that it worked instantly. We are so happy with the results that we are going to continue using their bi-monthly plan. We will be recommending them to everyone.</Text>

<review>They were quick to come out to service when i initially called. Veteran owned and Vet discount 👍🏼  Professional service and he took the time to explain what was going to happen post-spray. There still were some residual critters after but I called and they came out again no charge. I would definitely recommend this company.<//review>< GmapID>

I have had my home for 10 years and never had a need for pest control, that was until we had a flea problem out of nowhere.  The backyard was infested and we didn't even want to go back there, I looked around on the internet and saw a lot of places don't  post prices and had mixed reviews. I then came across Next Generation that had prices which are competitive to what I have found and very good reviews which is also a plus, what sealed the deal for me was finding out they are veteran own and operated. I called in the AM and had an appointment 2 days later, they have excellent customer service and when it came time for them to spray the tech that ended up being the owner was super nice and informative. He confirmed we had a big issue in the backyard and even switched up the chemicals to make sure he got rid of them. It's been about a month or so and they have really been nocked down we can now go back into our yard without getting chewed to bits by fleas, I have also seen a reduction in other pests too. If you need pest control don't hesitate to call this awesome company.
Thank you Next Generation</text>

< Review>
Next Generation's customer service is above and beyond.  I had questions and the receptionist (I forgot her name, sorry) was able to help me and give me the information I needed. They were able to fit us in the next day, which was pretty awesome.

Our exterminator was Stephen,  and he was very prompt and professional.  He did a very thorough consultation and he touched base again after the treatment and gave me a run down of what he'd done.  I was really impressed because other pest control companies we've tried weren't as thorough and did the bare minimum.

The pricing is reasonable, and they're totally accommodating. I highly recommend them.  Our backyard looks like a bug graveyard, but that means the job was done.</Review>

<Text>The best pest service, by far. We get monthly preventive treatments and they’ll return at no charge if there’s issues in between appointments. They text before arriving, always attempt to make contact at time of service and are above and beyond friendly, respectful, and professional. Support this veteran-owned business!<//Text>< Pictures>

Great service, good rates, friendly employees. Sprayed every nook and cranny she could.
Update: They seem to do good work but I have asked multiple times for them to call before arriving and they never do. I never know the appointment date until the day before and I never get a courtesy call before they arrive. This is very frustrating. If we don’t know what day and time they are coming then we can’t be there to let them in our garage or backyard for them to spray. Maybe I should just stop letting them in and make them come back multiple times before next appointment so they can get the picture. Fix this or I will be canceling service. I find it very unprofessional.<//Review>

The team at Next Generation Pest are amazing.  They initially came out and did a routine spray.  About 2 weeks later we started having an any problem inside the house.  Called Next Generation Pest and they had a team member come out first thing the next morning.  A week later no more ants.  Then about a week after my ant problem we started having pigeons nesting under our solar panel.  Called Next Generation Pest, they had someone access the situation the next day and was able to set me up with installation 2 days later.  They did a great job bird proofing my roof and cleaning everything.  And the best part about the service... was the price.  The bird proofing was the cheapest price around, I saved a few hundred using Next Generation Pest.  Highly recommend 👍</Text>

Jonathan was non pressure, spoke in terms I understood, and even did a couple of things to better manage points of entry for rodents that we had not discussed initially. Plus I'm happy that I went local, with a smaller company. Let me tell you, we've contracted Terminix in the past, I'll leave it there!! Now we have to wait for the results, the service was done today, so we will know in a week or two. Definitely a good experience thus far.< /text>

The usual great service experience with Next Generation Pest Control .  They have been very responsive.  The service is always 5 Star.  We are perfectly happy with Next Gen.  I even recommended Next Gen to a door to door representative from a competitor.😊<//Review>

<review>Great team! Always arrive with a smile, friendly professional service, prepared to treat  all areas
of the yard and exterior house for creepy crawlers.  I am very happy with Next Generation Pest Control.
They took care of an ant issue that started a couple years ago for the first time. Haven’t seen any ants since. Apparently, the ants were building colonies on the perimeter areas of yard. Rarely see any webs outside, much less anything else.  Good job, guys!<//review>< gmap_id>

I thought that the war I have been battling with them  would be one that I would NEVER win and I would be fighting with them for the rest of my life but then my daughter convinced me to call Next Generation and it was the best decision that I have ever made! Now, not only can I breathe a sigh of relief but I can enjoy my home again because I have not seen 1 single bug of any kind, anywhere on my property. Thank you so much, Next Generation for making this happen for me and I am eternally grateful.<//review>< pics>

I've known and conducted business with Steven for years and have always been impressed with the integrity that he handled his business and clients.   I have been using them for about 6 Months now and am enjoying our yards and home without the nuisance of insects and bugs especially at this time of the year.  I highly recommend.

Thank you Next Generation!</review>

<text>We thought we had bats or rats in our attic. Found Next Generation Pest control online. Impressed with website. Called owner Stephen and he showed up next day and thoroughly inspected our attic even though two nationally known pest companies had found nothing. He narrowed down the problem to a vent pipe from a bathroom exhaust fan. Two days later he and Mitchel disconnected the pipe and removed nearly a cubic foot of grassy nesting material from birds. Very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly. We signed up for regular pest control services. We highly recommended this company.

Thank you Next Generation Pest Control for your prompt attention to our concerns. We called Friday, before Labor Day weekend and they arrived on Tuesday to complete our first inspection and service. Stephen gave a thorough review of his services as well as expectations. We were unhappy with our previous pest control company that we had been with for many years due to constant pest problems even though we routinely requested the former company take care of it. Stephen not only addressed why these issues continued but explained how he would continue to maintain and prevent. We were told to expect a few bugs due to him flushing a few nests but since his visit only 1 week ago, we have only seen ONE inside our home. One tiny little earwig. Before we had several spiders a day, several earwigs, and many other pests outside the home and inside our garage. I hope that this level of service continues, if it does we will be loyal customers for life. I have a phobia of bugs and simply will not tolerate them inside my home. Next Generation seems to have heard my plea and answered that call. Thank you! 5 ⭐️’s! I will review again in a few months and hopefully it’s still 5 star’s with little to no bugs. Let’s go ahead and say no bugs. Ha!</Text>

<review>I had a really bad case of wasps at my house and decided that I couldn’t tackle the problem myself so I went online to find a pest control company that would be able to help. As soon as I saw Next Generation Pest Control I messaged them for a quote and their response was amazingly quick. They were out the very next day and took care of my problem without a hassle and also pointed out other issues that could arise as well as taking care of spiders and spider webs. Their customer service is amazing and they are very thorough with their services. I would 10/10 recommend to anyone who is having any pest related issues. I am now a regular customer and couldn’t be happier! Thank you Stephen and Erica for your awesome work and being so helpful with our pest problem. Two thumbs up for a great company!<//review>< pictures>

They never pushed me for a certain type of service, they told me what their recommendation was and let me pick. The price isnt the cheapest nor most expensive Ive found, but its also not outrageous and I get to support a local business.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x8090403f0a03d087:0x992518765885c91<//GmapID></record>

<Review>Mitchell came out today for our first treatment and before he could even leave the bugs were already dropping dead. He also located an ants nest that has been super active in our backyard. We have littles and making sure outside is kid friendly is a priority. I am so glad I was referred to this company. Also, no extra fees for "first time set up" like some other companies is a plus! 👍< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate><username>Vanessa Lopez<//username><Gmap_id>0x8090403f0a03d087:0x992518765885c91<//Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Time>1558559050288</Time>< user>

<Review>My cousin signed up with Next Generation Pest Control a few months ago and told me how happy she was with their service. I had a problem with spiders I was avoiding but then I noticed an infestation of aphids. It was time to deal with it. I called Next Generation Pest Control and Mitchell was able to come out the next day and take care of me. I was impressed with his professionalism and customer service. I had quotes in the past to do a monthly service from other companies and Next Generation Pest was by far the best priced. I highly recommend this company for all your pest needs.<//Review>< user>

We had Mitchell come out today, from Next Generation Pest Control, and he did a fantastic job for us! Not only did he spray for ants and gnats, but he also cleaned the spider webs from all of our stucco outside. Mitchell is very personable, conscientious and reasonable as well. We were very pleased with what he did for us!<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I’ve never hired a pest control service before so I did not know what to expect from prices and quality at all. After a lot of research and reviews it finally came down to 2 choices but ultimately I went with Next Generation Pest Control because when I spoke Mitchell I did not feel pressured to get the service and he did not bombard me with a bunch nonsense. He was polite and quick to answer all my questions, I signed up for the 6 month service and the following day I called to find out about the appointment, he quickly said that he would be over the same day and gave me a 2 hour window and sure enough he showed up within that time. In person Mitchell was very professional, had a clean attire, and his vehicle was organized and I was also impressed that since he is the owner and comes out to service sites too which says a lot since most owners don’t do that, He listened to my needs when it came down to the pests that I had and needed removed and explained in full detail what he was going to do, he quickly cleaned my house of all spiderwebs and began spraying with a pressurized sprayer. Once he was done he gave me a fast recap on what he did, overall I have seen a lot of dead bugs around my house, I am 100% satisfied with the service, professionalism,  and I would definitely recommend his service to anyone who is looking for a great pest control service...Thank you Mitchell...<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<username>Dex Ter<//username><Review>Called Next Generation after not being able to get our black widow and weird roach problem under control.  Technician Mitch came out only one time and we haven't had a concern since.  During his visit he was able to inform us on what type of roach it was, ease our mind as this was not an infestation, and gave us pointers on how to not have them come back.  Very professional, courteous, and we were very pleased with the service.< /Review><GmapID>0x8090403f0a03d087:0x992518765885c91</GmapID>< Rate>

<review>I'm very impressed,  I called at 12 noon on a  Saturday with a problem I discovered on Friday night, I explained the situation to a gal at the office ( who was very nice and patient with all my questions). she contacted someone who was working that day to try and fit me into the schedule.

Long story short Stephen contacted me within 15 min, said he would be here by 1400. He showed up on time was very professional, easy to talk to, answered all my questions and explained everything and what they do when they come out. He took care of everything and was done way quicker than I expected and the cost was very reasonable!

I'm extremely pleased with Next Generation Pest Control! Thank you very much!<//review>< date>

<text>Mitchell and Stephen were fast, friendly and prompt. They came when they said  they would and completed the job quickly and efficiently. Had been hearing pecking all over the roof. They said the chicken wire that had been put up by the previous owner was not cutting it and the birds could easily get under it. They removed it and replaced it with professional grade pidgeon wire. Very happy with the new wire.< /text><user_name>Gm Francois< /user_name>< response>

These guys are great.  I spoke to Mitchell today, and they followed up with an appointment the same day.  Unbelievable, but they had an opening and squeezed me in.  Steven showed up right on time and introduced himself and we discussed some of the issues I was concerned about, so after a few minutes he got to work.  And what a job he did.  I cant Express how satisfied o am with their services.  Everything about these guys speak professionalism.  Give them a call and you will find out   thanks Mitchell and Steven<//review>

<Review>Stephen contacted me promptly when I made an inquiry through home advisor. He came out to see me for an estimate within 1day. Stephen was very professional and provided a competitive quote for a pidgeon issue at my home. Stephen and Mitchell arrived on time and completed the work to my satisfaction in less than 1 week of when I made the call. I've signed up for their regular pest service as well. I would recommend this company to anyone looking for a pest control service.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x8090403f0a03d087:0x992518765885c91< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Next Generation Pest Control is a really great company with spectacular service! Stephen came by today and sprayed the inside and outside of the house and cleared all the cob webbs and made sure I didn’t need anything else before he left. They have a customer for life!<//Text>

<review>Called Next Generation for a bat problem in my attic. They were very responsive and came out the next morning. Mitchell gave good advice as we went through the attic and perimeter of the house together. Great price and will be looking at using them for regular pest control as well.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I called numerous places when I discovered I had a bed bug problem. Many of the places where seriously expensive and required a ton of work on my end. Stripping every bed in the house. Moving a lot of furniture and displaced my family a significant period. With no garantee.  Next generation came and look at the situation and quoted a much more reasonable price and garanteed results. I gave them the green light. That was several months ago. Completely resolved.,
I now continue a bi-mothly service with them that I am very pleased with. Zero pest issues including, finally no ants. I rate the best.< /review>< date>

<review>They keep the park relatively clean. Not too crowded in the morning hours. It has 3 basketball hoops.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c433c679ffe7:0xc96021ce28cb9823</Gmap_id><rating>4< /rating><resp>None<//resp>< user>

Rose Hills Rec Center has a great park director Leticia (Letty) she and her assistants are very helpful. There are lots of children activities and a senior group that meets there with many outings. The playground/park area is small, it feels just right for it's size. There is soccer, baseball, basketball, BBQ area with tables and for the toddlers there is a sand box. The playground has gentle rolling hills to sit, relax and take in the beautiful view of the San Gabriel mountains (clear day). On windy days you can fly a kite, and see the white clouds passing in the blue sky. Bring a volleyball net, set it up in the outfield and have a ball. The playground/park is clean and maintain nicely, very nice. May you have fun and enjoy...<//Review>

I love this park. It offers free meal suppers, dances, it's accessible and free parking and it's safe for all kids to use. It has bathrooms as well and friendly service</text>

Rose Hill Recreation playground/park is just the right size, not so big that you lose sight of your children. You can watch your kids play baseball, basketball, or for toddlers they have a secure sand box area. This rec center has soft rolling hills, that you can lay down relax and still have a view of the playground. You can also BBQ under beautiful shaded trees near restrooms and Rec office. So bring the family and friends and enjoy the day. Yes it's a small rec center, but (less is more). Meet and greet, get to know your Rose Hill Rec Center, and your Rose Hills community...<//Review>

<review>I have been a repeat customer of AVT since 2015...David and his crew have always done an excellent job in a timely manner. The work has always been fairly priced. I highly recommend AVT. Also I would like to say over the years I have brought AVT domestic dodge mercury and import honda and german audi. They are knowledgeable and get the job done right the first time.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The unprofessionalism of this place is repulsive. I paid 2 thousand dollars and waited over 2 months for a job that should have taken a week. Then when i get my car back not only is the original issue not addressed, yet come to find out the grill has been hacked out multiple times then spot welded quite poorly i might add. Not to mention the mangled dipstick the so called “mechanics” tried to force into an engine in which it doesn’t belong; as well as various wires and cords left hanging loosely, free to get caught in the belts or fan. All of this aside, when brought to the mechanics attention they attempt to lie to me and say that is how it has to be done. In reality the reason the “mechanics” cut my front grill off my car was the result of pure laziness meaning they didn’t t want to do it the right way and take the engine apart to get it out, so they just cut my car apart. Beware of these con-artists at all cost.<//Text>

<review>Giving them 3 stars. Came home and checked the fluid level on my transmission after they installed a new transmission. The dipstick was broken, missing several inches of the lower dipstick. No one told me they broke it, in addition to this several bolts were loose when I got the truck back home.<//review><time>1572202439996< /time>< username>

Fresh, great flavor and texture. Fast service. Not a lot of seating for lunch rush, but would definitely recommend for take out. Paid about 11 bucks for a pretty big sandwich and a Vietnamese espresso.</Text>

Great food, good customer service and speedy food prepping process. Staff are friendly and seem to enjoy their work that they too have fun in the kitchen.  A nice and welcoming atmosphere.<//Text>

Great hearty sandwich and great Viet coffee.  They have some baked pastries in a clean shop as well.  Expect to pay a little more, but definitely a good place to get your sandwich and coffee fix.</review>

This place has great food! I can only speak for the banh mi, but I can only imagine that everything else on the menu is great as well. <3</Text>

<review>I cannot believe the hype around this place. Went here because I needed a quick bite. I’m quite fond of Vietnamese food so I like seeing what different places have to offer and this place was very disappointing. A one star is extreme but I’ve read and seen the other reviews on here and yelp and I just can’t believe them. At the very least this place is not representative of “inexpensive” or “Vietnamese” food.  I don’t know why this place is listed as cheap because it’s a rip-off compared to other restaurants that serve the same food in the same area.

My grips:

Bahn Mi Sandwich
- Their small is priced what most places charge normally and their “large” is $2 more and is the size of most place’s regular size.

- There was less meat on the large than what I get on most place’s regular sized and cheaper sandwiches.  I’d say vegetarians should consider this place if you’re worried about getting meat on your sandwich because you won’t.

- “Large” means “more bread”.

- Someone there must own a pepper farm because these people seem to think spicy peppers should be used as a filler instead of a garnish.

Vietnamese Iced Coffee

- Same “small” and “large” problems as the sandwich.

- 3/4 of the drink was thick cubed ice.

- The server initially gave me a small even though I asked and paid for a large.  I corrected him and watched him remake the next one. He just poured the small into a large cup, and added a few more ice cubes.

-  The server asked me before making the drink (in the wrong size) if I wanted it sweet.  I said yes. The drink was more bitter than a Starbucks cold stale straight black brew.

I’m not a foodie and I don’t normally care enough about poor restaurant experience to say anything. I just don’t go back. Obviously this place inspired me to react this way. That’s not a motivator I’d like associated with my Vietnamese restaurant of choice.< /review>< Pictures>

Adding a star because I keep coming back and it really is good. And apon further

Good food. The person behind the counter stopped taking my order mi sentence to greet a friend in Vietnamese. They spoke for about 45 seconds before he let me continue.<//text>

<Text>Hands down my favorite Banh Mi spot.   Blows other places out of the water! Even the larger more known ones in SD.   Number 1 and Number 8 are our favorites.   The tofu is delicious and great for vegetarians!   Born and raised in SD but currently stationed in AZ.   I make the drive from Arizona about once a week and this is always my first stop before I do anything.    It’s also my last stop on the way home to grab to go!</Text></record>

<Review>I just tried their special Banh Mi since this is a Banh Mi shop after all.  Compare to the other close by shop, the taste was not terrible but nothing special.  For the price, you can get better elsewhere.  Service was friendly and quick so it's great for lunch time.  I would come back to try other stuffs on their menu.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Excellent Banh Mi Sandwiches.  The bread was fresh and crispy, and the grilled pork and veggies were marinated just right.  The owner was friendly and calling in my order avoided any lines.  It's definitely my favorite Banh Mi in SD.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>A great balance of flavorful meats, fresh greens, good picklings and soft bread makes this sandwich one of the better ones.  A pricier sandwich but it packed top to bottom. Pâté chauds are flaky good.  Vietnamese iced coffee good and strong.  Friendly service.  Shared parking in a busy shopping center.</text></record>

Had a tofu veggie banh mi. The tofu was cooked sweet which wouldn't be my first choice, but still tasted really good. All the veggies were super fresh. The bread was so good and quality that reminds me of Bale Sandwiches which is my go to, but is unfortunately so far from me. I was reluctant to post this since I feel like this area finally got the sandwich shop it deserved and I would love to keep this place to myself. Prices are great and it looks like they have tons of other stuff to try. I'll be back!<//text>

<review>Their banh mi bread was so dry and difficult to eat. I ended up pulling the meat out and eating it alone. I was really surprised. Their pork pate pastry is delicious. And their spring rolls are decent. I will still come back, just not for their sandwiches.<//review>< time>

Awesome breakfast croissant sandwiches! Definitely worth an out of the way trip in the morning. Fresh baked croissants, pastries and the baguettes are awesome. The baker really knows his trade. Friendly owner and staff. Fast service. Outside and comfortable inside seating great for a little laptop work - wifi. A little difficult to see this jem from the street behind the Carl's Jr., so hopefully Google can help remedy that. Also, good expresso with added condensed milk for a semi-sweet caffeine boost.<//text>

< Review>
At $4.49 for the banh mi special sandwich, this is more expensive than what I am used to. However it's open at 7am ...earlier than most banh mi places, so this would be my first stop before road trips.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Hello Auntie Hue how are you? You are Russian child. On the day I heard my mother say that she was texting or telephoning aunt and Aunt Lan all refused. I just came out here. Mother and son should do nothing. But today I sent a message to my aunt on behalf of my mother. Ah ah, I went to the street to carry a gucci bag, and I drove my car to the door wide, why did you want me to pay money? Friends at the time of the wedding, my mother thought that the intellectuals of the intellectuals opened a US company to whip up her aunt and aunt. The new hour is "rogue fake intellectual" is the wife ck aunt. Did you go to the temple to be a ghost? Teachers owe debt kiep now does not check the kiep after providing pay. Quick retribution. I am reminding her that I am not looking for money, but I am also trying to find out how to protect my family and people in my family to ask brankcruptcy. So I will take pictures of my aunt's aunt to post len ​​group Vietnamese in America, Vietnamese people o san diego and many other groups, we know that my family is living like that so we do not suffer like your mother. I will scan the news for my family and the people I know. I hope no one is conn like you wish you and your family happy. Ah, there is also a safe aunt who has facebook de con up, let her know that her parents ate "bowl of it"
Hue Johnson is owner. She & her own husband my money but don't want to give E the money. So i would like everyone in San Diego know her family better and the company fraud in vn không phải victim of her family.

(Original)
Hello Dì Huệ khoẻ không? Con là con của cô Nga. Hôm bữa tình cờ nghe mẹ con nói là nhắn tin hay điện thoại dì và dì Lan đều từ chối. Con kiếm dì giờ mới ra đây.  Mẹ con hiền nên không làm gì.

<text>Their food menu is pretty good I liked it. There are some menus have pork in it, since I don't like pork so they replace it with turkey bacon for me. Loved their coffee and cream. Coffee was perfectly warmed. Stuffs are very friendly. They try their best to keep everything very clean & sanitized for you. Stuffs wear mask. Overall it was a nice experience for me.</text>< rate>

<text>It's busy here but the food is great! They hired new workers and the management here is very good , you won't be disappointed. They follow social distancing by placing window dividers in between each booth and they disinfect the tables after each use.

I ordered the cinnamon pancakes which comes with eggs and hash browns with turkey bacon .

To those who can't eat pork, you can ask for alternative options. Like instead of pork bacon they can give you turkey bacon.  The food is very good!</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO28NZguzs7MccZYqWPG0gy7jNobBWKUGrXqqbN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

It takes some time for them to even take our drink order. Then when they finally take our food order it takes a long while to get it. I know things are different but when you're dining out with a child it can be a bit challenging.</Text>< user_name>

<Text>This particular Denny's is wonderful.  The restaurant was very clean, very covid-19 safe and has an extremely friendly staff.  Our waitress was attentive and pleasant. Our meals were delicious and much better than most chain restaurants.  Hot, fresh, smelled good, plentiful and most important delicious! We look forward to frequently visiting even though it is a distance from our home.  Well worth the drive for a pleasant dinner out.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Service is ALWAYS great, chefs are always understaffed and overworked, franchise owner cuts way too many corners. I remember ordering chicken tenders to go and they gave me about a fifth of a pound of chicken for $12+. The four fingers they gave me were smaller than my own, and unfortunately I am not an exceptionally large man, width or height.< /text>< rating>

Great customer service here. It wasn't busy at all. The dining area is closed for indoor dining, so there is an outdoor tent that is open for dining. Food was great as well. I will most likely return when I am in the area. Love the double cheeseburgers!!</Text>

Denny's has been disappointing the last couple of years.
This location is no exception, there are a couple dedicated hard working people working here. However that does not make up for the dingy, lack of cleanliness, or the drastically overpriced food.<//text>

Absolutely fantastic, and more than your money's worth. The food was great and quite frankly, way more than we could eat. Delicious! Ordered 2 burgers and an omelette. Jeez, the amount of food was crazy. I haven't seen burgers that big in it seems years. You would laugh trying to compare say McDonald's or Burger King, or even Carl's Jr. Definitely worth your time.</Text>

I ordered the berry & vanilla crepes to go tonight. What I got was pure cold, soggy, mush, in a strawberry soup.(see pictures) Do not waste your $ money on the crepes, well at least if you're ordering to go! They obviously don't have any standards if you're not eating in their presence So disgusting. ( FYI these pictures were taken within 3 minutes after I received my order)</text>

Our waitress was very nice, but my food was messed up and all they did was scrape some the gravy off (it still had a ton on it) and put the meat back on the plate upside-down.</review>

<text>Ok the 1 in Rancho Cordova was a let down burnt our hash brown soggy toast . However you want to truly enjoy Denny's go to the Denny's in Cameron Park Ca. The staff very friendly and professional the cook thier is very good all our food was cooked perfect not over cooked at all or over salted my husband salad was huge and fresh the Manager was very very polite even took out the tip we left to our server his shift had ended as we were cashing out

Denny's in Cameron Park Ca so far os better then any other Denny's I have had in ca since the 2000 .<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I am giving denny's 4 stars based off this very delightful item I discovered on there menu called Fried Cheese Melt. Now I feel between the descent service, and the cleanliness of the store this rating is perfect. However this Fried Cheese Melt has been a staple for me at this particular restaurant made up of fried cheese sticks cooked up into a grilled cheese with a side of very delicious marinara sauce. I even prefer pesto over marinara for almost all my dishes but between the combination and taste of that marinara and cheese stick/grilled cheese fusion I can't imagine a better sauce. Denny's will definitely be seeing me again in the near future.< /Text>

<Text>This Dennys has always been very friendly to all varieties of people-not discriminatory like a lot of places, nor are they lazy. They aren't "off in their own world". They seem to work great as a team, picking up where another left off and so forth, rather seamlessly . i feel like they have genuine smiles. Even better is they aren't greedy for that penny or 2 you might be short either!<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< name>

< Review>
Management is terrible. I feel bad for the servers.

Tonight, attempted to dine in with my young son and waited nearly an hour without food.

We left and received an apology from the server when the manager should’ve apologized and give some type of compensation.</Review>

<resp>None</resp><user_id>104823938511964985091</user_id><review>I visited this location with my family last minute as our reservations at another restaurant fell through. When we arrived we were promptly seated. We then waited a few minutes for our waitress. We ordered our food and that’s were the mess started. My burger was so greasy the entire bun was soaked and you couldn’t even pick it up. I paid extra for onion rings and received 4 rings on my plate that must have been sitting under a heat lamp. My wife ordered chicken strips that came out severely over cooked. The breading was very thick and almost dusty because of how Over cooked they were. The fries were great. My daughter ordered a pancakes plate and we asked for no bananas but of course it came loaded with bananas and when they “rushed” a new order out that took at least 12 mins. When they came out the pancakes were burnt and my daughter only ate 1/2 of the two pancakes which are usually her favorite. Outside of the lackluster food we were checked on maybe once and that was only when the check was dropped off. We sat around for another few minutes with no one coming to the table. We then paid and left. Hopefully this can be used as a training opportunity. I won’t be getting my money back so might as well use it as a learning moment.<//review><pics>None< /pics><gmapID>0x809add820c8b2e85:0x1e6bf59acfd05c4</gmapID></record>

This Denny’s has really well prepared food!!! I love the classic bar up front and the neon signs, it makes for a great vintage atmosphere. Tati is the best server, she always remembers us when we walk in and knows our previous orders! Such a sweet girl! Request her and TIP!< /Review>

Friendly faces and great food make for a sparkling ambiance. The perfect place to get the perfect meal before OR after that regrettable drunken sexual encounter. It's also a great place to meet people for said encounters, just ask your waiter for details.<//Review>

Lousy parking. Crowded when they did the remodeling they should have increased the size of the dining area, instead peoples tables are so close you feel like you are sharing a  table with strangers. Waitress was very nice. Hamburger was so greasy and the meat tasted like cheap ground meat it had a weird flavor. And the only alternative to bacon and sausage if you are allergic to pork is turkey bacon they need to add turkey or chicken sausage.</Text>

Stopped in yesterday on 3-28-2019. Was given great service and this was by far the Best Denny’s food and quality of food that we have ever eaten. Generous portions. We live about 15 miles away, but will definitely make the short trip for a great breakfast.< /Text>

My father dines at various Denny’s and had never been so poorly served. To start off they were seated far out from everyone else. Seemed like the servers were debating who would tend to them. My father asked for coffee and was served maybe half a cup of coffee and was never asked If he would like a full. Getting silverware was An act of congress. My son really felt like they were not being treated correctly. And asked if maybe they were being treated like that because they are Mexican. Mind you my son is nine and half white half

<Text>Half the food came out way earlier than the other food which doesn't make sense. Two chicken fried steaks, over easy eggs and hash browns came out faster than bacon and eggs... The bacon was undercooked for what was actually ordered and 2 pieces missing, and there was eggshells in one order of eggs. I have no real complaints about our waitress Tiana, who was still learning the ropes and super friendly, a large group came in and we felt like we were pushed to the wayside.< /Text><UserId.>108984405933985254397</UserId.><rating>3</rating><resp>None<//resp><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<Text>Denny's is always a great place to go late at night after a fun event, but skip this one. We have never had service this bad! We couldn't even get a to go menu. From rolling eyes, making us leave the table, because we were ordering out, to taking our order with her back turned to us Joylynn was the most awful excuse for a waitress we have ever had. I shouldn't have given them our business, but we were starving and it was late. Do not go to this location, we never will again. If you do go, check your order prior to leaving.</Text><rating>1</rating><Name>Stacey Carson<//Name>< Gmap_id>

My server was from "across the pond" I guess you'd say. He was awesome. Now with his own customers with everybody in the restaurant. He was just such an outgoing nice guy. Wish I could remember his name but  the restaurant was in Rancho Cordova California.<//text>

Not bad, not great.  Cramped seating and somewhat costly meals considering the mediocre quality, but reliably open and typically without much of a wait to be seated.  Clientele really brings the venue down a star, though - rare is the Denny's trip where there's not a screaming child at one booth or another.<//Review>

Well took 15 minutes to seat us & after waiting 10 mins to take our order we walked out. The manager or supervisor on duty does not seem to manage the team. He seemed not to be a multi tasker. Normally we have good service.  I do know they were busy but they had a good staff o. Hand. Also one of the waitresses was leaving asked of he wanted her to stay. He said no. Also the person. Supervisor on duty had no name tag could not get his name. If I see him on staff I will walk out.< /Review>

The customer service here was horrible. I came in to have breakfast just me around 10:45am.This was still in the morning time and there was a few families seated but majority or everyone looked to have been served their food.There was a couple who was seated just before me and there was a couple who arrived after I sat down. The couple who arrived after me had their order taken before me..no big deal figured she would come to me next. I waited around 10 more minutes to have my order taken after I just witnessed them taking the other couple order. After ordering another 10-15 minutes go by before I even recieved my appetizer. At this point I'm getting frustrated. I go to the restroom in hopes of having my food placed on the table by the time I return.Walking to the restroom I see the couple who was seated just before me getting their plates cleared from finishing their entire meal. Unacceptable after that I tried to inform my waiter of this she seemed to not care that much paid for appetizer that was burnt by the way but I still paid. Needless to say I won't be returning<//Text>

Me and a friend came in on a Friday night around 8:30. They were very clearly understaffed. Food took a long time and multiple tables were having issues all around us. The server was very professional and did their best given a bad situation but I would not go again.<//Review>

Slower than slow!  Got seated right away... noticed it was 10:08am. Waitress asked if we wanted coffee? No water please...10:21 finally got some water, hold on... she'll be back, that at lease only took a couple minutes... she took our order... 10:54 our food finally came. Minus the sugar free syrup and my coffee. Told her to forget the coffee. by now I had given up... never did get the sugar free syrup back to me...  she never came back until time to give us our check... whick she charged us for the coffee...<//text>

It's a Denny's, clear and true to what it is. Not the best food, but not the worst, it maintains it standard of food and service. Would go again and probably will.</Review>

It's Denny's. If you haven't been there, I don't know why not. This location is hit and miss on wait time depending on the size of the crowd but the service is always friendly, the food is good and comes hot (or cold if it's supposed to be), the refills keep comin', and they take coupons. Want breakfast for dinner? Or lunch? Or breakfast? Or in the middle of the night because you have the munchies? Denny's is the place to go. 😀 They have surprisingly good nachos, too.< /Text>

The service is pretty good most of the time. The food is hit or mis though. For what it is, it's kinda pricey. But it's a chill place to grab a quick bite or even just have a meeting or whatever. So I guess what I'm trying to say is it's alright.</text>

Food service after being seated was good. Initial customer service when my wife an I arrived was terrible. People that arrived later than we did were being seated first. It wasn't until I asked what was going on that it was noticed that we were on the top of the list.  Servers on the other hand were gracious and attentive.< /Text>

<Review>The server my family and I had just before midnight on 6/3 named Nathan was so kind, so funny, so friendly. I just had to write a review so this location knows he is doing a great job. He is the kind of server you would want for your family. Definition of service with a smile from a friendly face.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Okay, does Denny's really deserve a five-star rating? Well, as a diner it does. Service is fast and efficient, the food is tasty and consistent, and the menu is kept fresh with seasonal or promotional items. In a sense, Denny's is the Great American diner. Though I typically go there for an occasional breakfast (omlette or the Grand Slam, I will go for lunch once in a while to get a Club sandwich. They've been around for years, so chances are that you've experienced Denny's before. If not, I don't think you'll be disappointed, knowing what to expect.< /Review><time>1547080109424<//time><name>m d</name><UserId.>117005227251539850897<//UserId.><resp>None<//resp><Rating>5<//Rating>< pics>

The absolute worse place ever. I'd give it less than one star of I could. They allow dogs in there, people in bikinis and shirtless too. My husband and I left because of the quality of food and service. We got outside and saw a bunch of kids in party buses going in and out and then taking off their clothes LITERALLY to use the bathroom right outside where everyone can see them. Will NOT ever go back. Tried calling to complain, no answer go figure.<//Text>

Excellent experience. We were served with a smile and Vega was really nice to our family. The waitress went out of her way to discuss the discounts available and we realized we qualified for one that we hadn’t been using at a Denny’s before. The staff made the experience.< /text>

She wasn’t being  attentive at our table the whole meal we had. In the middle of our meal she decided to take a break. In addition to our meal we discovered mold on our fruit and reported it to the cashier. The cashier called the manager over to us  and he totally disregarded the photo we showed him of the food. He tried to look up our receipt for the transaction but it wasn’t in the system since the waiter made us pay already. He responded by saying he would of applied a credit for the meal but since they already took the money there was nothing he’s going to do for us. I ask him for a refund but once again he said there’s nothing he could.<//text>< rate>

< Review>
This is an early morning review. The restaurant was pretty clean as you would expect for a place that didn't have many customers at that time. Was promptly greeted, seated, and given time to look over the menu. Food and service were alright. The bathrooms were well maintained as expected.</Review>

<Review>This Denny's is pretty consistent in having good service and food that matches. Sure they have busy times, but staff usually keeps pace. Easy to reach if going south on Sunrise, but not always so easy to get into if going north. (Got to get into that left lane early to flip the U.)<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Dennys is lacking lately with the $3 coffee, inconsistent food, and dated, old interior. Doesnt feel homey, or clean. This isnt a particular Dennys eother, consistant. Not sure what's hapoened, but is no longer an affordable option. 2 people $30 for slams? Rather go to mom n pop diner.<//Review>

I always have good service and the food is great.
This location might have issues with keeping employees as they are changing hands often.
My only gripe is the place could be cleaner as menus were dirty, tables and window sills could be cleaner. That all may be due to shortage of help or can't find good help.
Bottom line is the food is always good and the waiters/waitresses are friendly and hustle to give you great service.<//Text>

The manager is easy in the eyes.
Oh the staff is great too.
I came in today, and ordered biscuits and gravy. My biscuits were really hard and our drinks never got refilled. Dissapointed.< /review>

They were good when I was like 12 years old. Now, I just can't deal with the quality of the food. Lack of consistency but I will say their hours keep them on the map.</text>

<text>Food/service is good. They seem to have a little trouble making pancakes. Offer Great flavors, they're just a little tough. Overmixed I think. Chehalis stores service was iffy last time there about a week ago. Waiter forgot 3-4 items and he was a bit slow and they weren't that busy< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Terrible service! I placed an online order for delivery. Denny's uses third party delivery services, in my case Doordash. The driver got lost and barely spoke English, I got my order an hour late and incomplete.
I spoke to a manager at Denny's who assured me that he had issued a refund. A week later nothing. I called several times and was told it's my banks fault. No. They just have TERRIBLE service.

<Review>Very busy, that they took around 45:00 minutes just to get a dessert.
We had to waste more than 3 hours for dinner.

Waited along time for our food...one of our meals had been sitting under the lights for a good while when we finally had it served, sauce had a dry crust on top...not the worst Denny's I've been in, but not the best either.<//Review>

Service was extremely slow. If I hadn't been so hungry, I would have left. Had I been on a lunch break from work, I would have had to leave without eating. I won't return.</Text>

<Review>Food was good. Wrong potatoes were served. Asked for cheesy potatoes and was served with gravy instead. Bought apple pie to go and ice cream was added on hot pie which melted before I could get home. Would have preferred it was put in a separate container. Wasn't aware it came with ice cream too.</Review><gmapID>0x809add820c8b2e85:0x1e6bf59acfd05c4</gmapID>< Time>

Much nicer and cleaner than the last time I remember  (when we went there many year s ago). Not a cheap meal anymore but everything, except the bacon, was good. I will keep it in mind on Christmas morning.< /text>

<Review>Terrible experience.  Only went with intention of using a coupon from the 2018 greater sacramento dining & entertainment coupon book. Ordered 2 meals, coffee & soda. While we were eating the Server said they couldn't take the coupon due to it said "greater Sacramento" & this dennys was located in "Rancho Cordova". Lame for a business to be so petty & not  accommodate the situation with a compromise of accepting the coupon since we had already started eating.<//Review><date>1541391784690<//date></record>

The waitress service was really  bad asked her to bring silverware 3times our coffee was cold by the time she brought silverware, we had our grandkids and they were inpatient cause they were hungry, we tried to entertain but when food was brought 55 minutes later, our grandkids meals were the last ones to arrived, then  my husband and I ordered a Philly cheese steak sandwich mine had little tiny 5pieces of meat so I pulled meat aside put them in one of the corners of plate and waitress came over to bring my grandkids food, I asked for a $12 sanwich this is what I get of meat amount she took it back and brought it back and told me that this is the amount is to be in there, equals to 3oz, she told me they could remake it I should ordered something else. So I said forget it but is the last time I order again, when it was time to pay our bill was $64 split in half at the end wanted to charge us $84 so they had trouble trying to figure out. Never again this was their last chance<//review>

The service was sub par. I usually come into your restaurant every couple.of weeks and I have never had such bad service. I will no longer frequent your  restaurant. It is really a shame as I live in the mobile home park across the street from you.< /text>

Everyone knows Dennys and what they offer. This particular location is recently renovated, with comfortable seating. Service is generally good, the food is generally served as ordered. Overall, if you're looking for a Dennys, this location in Rancho Cordova is pretty good.<//text>

I am not generally a fan of Denny's however this location looks to be newly remodeled and the menu seems to change more often than other places which is nice. I had the veggie egg white skillet and it was really good.< /Text>

Ordered a mushroom avocado omelette.  I got a cheese omelette with maybe half cup of mushrooms & two thinly  sliced  avocado . It wasn't what I ordered. Food server said she ordered it as a cheese omelette $9.00 she added mushrooms $1.00 & added avo $1.50. $11.50 cheese omlette?!! SMH😣 disappointed.< /review>

I ordered food to go the lady i was talking to new no good info about the food didn't help nor give me a time to pick up. And when i got my food it was cold didn't even keep it warm eggs were bad the toast was even worse and the pancakes and biscuits and gravy where water down. Never coming back again if you are reading this owner you have lots to help in.</Text>

Its a nice resturaunt meant for larger groups. The food is very well made and tastes generally well. The only problems I have with it is the service was slow and it can get very packed. A good resturaunt for families.<//review>

They messed up an order for a peanut butter shake when on the menu it clearly has two different types of shakes but they wanted to tell me that there was only the one which was peanut butter and banana instead of the just chocolate peanut butter shake that I ordered< /Text>

The server, Scott, was very rude. And was also sexually harassing my wife with vulgar gestures. Tables were not cleaned ahead of our visit. Never returning here again.<//Review>

<text>Food is okay, but staff is inattentive when you first walk in.  You just stand there while they pay you no attention, this happens even when not busy.< /text>< Rating>

<review>Disappointed with the quality of the food. Not that I expected the best food in town, but Denny's quality has certainly gone downhill from where it was.  Maybe they just had a bad day, I don't know, but the quality just wasn't up to par.<//review></record>
