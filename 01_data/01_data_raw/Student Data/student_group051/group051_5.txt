<text>Thank you Armstrong Plumbing. I had a broken shower handle which forced us to shut the water off to the house. They were able to send out Josh right away, on a Friday, so we weren’t without water all weekend. I’m so thankful he found and replaced the part. Now we can keep clean!<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxFMLCss8QthPIqQBmn7DH3IMiqN32ms9sotzj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwSE1sTGcV0IfS-tpVITmx1lqTyKO5ZGvUym9g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1576526510221, 'text': 'Thank you for providing us with feedback!'}<//response>< gmapID>

<Review>Peter and his assistant were amazing. They came on time, were very professional and personable, and promptly fixed multiple plumbing issues in no time during their visit. They went above and beyond and I can't recommend them enough!

Look no further for a plumber, book their services now and be a happy customer. Thank you so much Armstrong Plumbing!< /Review>< Rating>

<review>Incredibly stressful experience. I had a faucet above the bathtub that needed repairing and in addition asked for a quote to replace the tub. The technician Vince was nice, he ordered the parts for the faucet and sent me a quote for a bath replacement which came at almost 10K. The bathtub itself was just a little above 2K and labor over 7K. I thought it was a tad excessive but nevertheless I did not want to believe that just because I am a female and a foreigner that someone would do price gouging thus I have asked for a second quote with a different tub. That quote never came. Change of tactics, asked to purchase the parts for the faucet from them so I could hire a different plumber, ironically every time I called Scott the manager is always out of the office (I wish I had his job : ) it seems that everyone I was attempting to reach is always at home. I am laughing at this experience as I was able to order the parts myself, tell the wholesale company that recommended Armstrong to me about my horrid experience and tell everyone I know just how unprofessional, price gouging and exploiting this company is. It made me want to become a plumber.  The conclusion is that it's never about the mistakes companies make but rather the client not being heard. All it would have taken for them was to call and say "we do not want to sell you the part or do business with you" and this review would have never been written and my time would have been spared.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Armstrong replaced my sewer line to the street a short time ago. They completed the job on time and my yard looks good as new. The trenchless technology was the way to go. I now have a plumber I can trust because they do what they say they will, all with a smile.< /Text>

<text>Ramon is awesome!  He and his assistant were courteous, professional and right on time.  This is the second time we’ve used Armstrong Plumbing and they are head and shoulders above plumbers I’ve had in the past.
Their trucks and equipment are first rate, their plumbers are knowledgeable and go out of their way to explain what they are doing and why.  They represent their employer very well, they take pride in their work.  They are careful to always wear masks and keep 6+ feet distanced (we first used Armstrong in April, just weeks into the pandemic shut down).
I have no problem giving Armstrong the very highest rating, I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone needing plumbing services.
Thanks Ramon!!< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1602083422989, 'text': 'We appreciate your business and look forward to working with you in the future!'}</Response><gmap_id>0x809ad9edc52ffb6d:0xef85787feae79adf<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have used Armstrong for my water softer install and they were great. This time I called Armstrong  told the lady on the phone I have a leak under the kitchen sink w my filters. Why would they not advise the plumber so that he has the right tools. I felt that I paid 165.00 for nothing. Send someone experienced in that area ??? Filters can leak if not changed from all the minerals collected from the water, it’s called build up. I don’t use the water from my kitchen sink to drink so I removed the water filtration myself. I could not see paying an Add’l 80 something an hour or 30mins. Their base rate is first 30mins 165.00 felt ripped off and no fix????? I can see 50.00 for a no fix but 165.00 crazy. Michael was nice but not knowledgeable w filters<//review>< pics>

Jon W from Armstrong Plumbing showed up early and de-scaled my tankless water heater for a fair price. He showed me how to do it myself too. He also, for no charge, looked at my toilet (phantom flushing) and told me what the problem was and that it was an easy fix I could do myself. He was polite and put on shoe covers. Couldn’t ask for more.</Review>

I used Armstrong Plumbing to replace my sewer line.  My house was built in 1936 and the lines were very old and deteriorating.  They were very efficient and mindful of not destroying my backyard.  Of the 3 companies I reviewed they were the most competitive.  I highly recommend them</text>

They were however able to get their remediation manager out to take a look. It was unfortunately a bad experience, as Mike pushed for a complete tear down of the entire area that was wet. The estimate was over $1K. The plumber I actually hired didn't recommend this action was warranted. I was quoted for removal of insulation when no insulation was in this garage space. If I hadn't gone up into the garage attic and checked myself, Armstrong's "professional" advice would have costed me unnecessary repairs. Buyer beware!</Review>< Pics>

Kenny was outstanding.  We had an unfortunate break in a water line and our home warranty company gave us the run around for 4 hours and ultimately said they could not help us.  We called Armstrong plumbing at 9PM and Kenny was at our door within an hour, fixed the broken line in 45 minutes and did a great job.  Would highly recommend Kenny and Armstrong plumbing.</review>

They were so crying about the whole thing and in fact they even waved the service fee.

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I needed a second opinion from a plumbing company in good standing, so I chose Armstrong Plumbing. Jason Wigginton, Service Estimator, diagnosed my home's plumbing problem and his diagnosis was totaling different than the first plumbing company. Basically, the first plumbing company estimated a cost of $800 with a $300 discount for a pressure reducing valve replacement. I don't have a pressure reducing valve on my water main. Talk about fraud by the first company!!! If you want an honest plumbing expert I recommend Jason with Armstrong Plumbing. He was reliable and thorough and honest with his findings. He saved me a lot of money on unnecessary replacement parts and labor. Don't forget to always get a couple estimates before you hire a contractor. Make one of those estimates from Armstrong Plumbing.</text>< Pics>

Thanks for sending Peter out to take of our plumbing problem today. He has a great sense humor and personality, and he took care of  the job quickly and efficiently. I will be using Armstrong for all future plumbing issues that may arise and with a nearly 70 year old home, they will arise . I also think Peter should get a raise.<//Review>

We had an emergency plumbing situation at one of our apartments complexes over Thanksgiving week. As always, Armstrong Plumbing was very responsive and professional when contacted. Their team members arrived early in their window of time and was thorough with the job as well as explaining the situation and remedy to my team. I highly recommend Armstrong Plumbing.</review>

I was able to book an on-line appointment on the week-end and confirm first business day. My plumbing needs were quickly diagnosed by Peter C. and the work was completed very professionally to my satisfaction. Peter arrived on time and the work was done within what I budgeted. I'm new to Sac and will definitely  use Armstrong Plumbing again for my plumbing needs.<//review>

We recently had a sewer line issue at our house and I was referred to Armstrong Plumbing by a neighbor of mine. Knowing nothing myself about how my sewer line works, my complete trust was in them. I called at 3:00 pm on a Tuesday and was informed by a friendly dispatch agent that service would arrive later that afternoon. They informed me of the hourly cost which comparing to others sounded reasonable.

Evan Dobrowski arrived at my door at 4:30 pm with a smile and a handshake. He inspected the issue, explained to me what he thought the problem was, then immediately began to work on it. Within minutes my sewer line was clear and water was flowing to the city line! *sweet—we can take showers and use the toilet*. Evan dropped a camera down the pipe and showed me on a monitor that a tree root had caused the backup in the line-- which was pretty freaking cool to see. The snake that he used was able to push through the clog and shave back the root so that the line would be temporarily clear.

Evan explained to me what the long-term solution would be so that my wife and I could make a decision on how to approach it. The quick work and thorough explanation, in language I could understand, made me feel like I called the right folks.

As I mentioned, I don’t have very much plumbing knowledge and so like most, I put my complete trust in to those that I hire. Because I trust my neighbors, I trust those that they recommend, and I’m very happy with decision I made to call Armstrong Plumbing.< /review>

George K., the plumber and his apprentice, Ian, exemplified competence, professionalism, and clear communication. Plus, they were congenial. We have floundered around with various plumbing companies, and we finally have confidence ithat Armstrong is the premier company to call for plumbing issues.< /review>

Asked them to investigate a recurring problem with a sink drain that had come apart prior, causing water damage to my building. Their plumber came, met my tenant, tightened the pipe, and left, sending me a bill for their minimum visit fee of $165. I can and did tighten this pipe already, and didn't need to pay someone $165 to do so again. I was hoping to be advised of root cause, what I could do to prevent, what to replace, etc. I'm still in the same state as before, with a plumbing problem that's likely to recur. I deployed a bucket and will consult someone else.

I wrote a letter to complain and never received an answer. However, they did charge my credit card anyway.

A month prior, I called them for a clogged pipe at another property. The same plumber as above came. He did address the problem. However, I was very adamant that we be careful in the space, as it's where my blind cat lives, and we needed to be mindful of the door. After he finished, he left, and I discovered that he left the door open. My cat escaped, but came back, thankfully! I also noticed that he left my front door open, and I'm grateful that my other cat didn't make a run for it.

I never write bad reviews, but this is deserved. You have your choice of plumbers, and you want to do business with someone who is responsible, professional, and provides good service. I did not get that, and I have several properties to maintain. I will take my business elsewhere.<//Review>

TLDR:
If you need a plumber, pick Armstrong Plumbing. Their prices are fair and their people amazing.

My Experience:
I contacted and scheduled an appointment with Armstrong Plumbing to look at my toilet and fix a few things related to plumbing that have been annoying my wife and I.

Their dispatcher was upfront about the costs we would pay and hourly rates. Once I agreed, they sent their plumber, Vince.

Now, I have a 10 week old son who was at the time of the appointment was in the middle of a nap. Vince came over and was everything you want a service person to be: clean, polite, knowledgeable, empathetic, and cost conscious.

He called instead of rang the door bell, wore slip on covers, used gloves, diagnosed problems, provided ranges of solutions for budgeting and was empathetic of my wife and I dealing with a sleeping child.

When he had to do work, he made sure to be a quiet as possible and told us the expect noise level so we could be ready to either move our child away or stay in the room where he was sleeping.

When we were done, the prices were exactly what was quoted and expected. There was no deviation, no "additional charges".

All in all, I had a fantastic experience.<//text>

This was my second experience with Armstrong Plumbing, and it was again excellent. Their technician Peter arrived on time, was very professional, and explained exactly what he was going to do.  On finding the problem, he explained what was needed, and that due to the the nature of the problem (roots in a drain line) it might reoccur in the future.

I'm very impressed with this company and won't hesitate to call them in the future.<//review>

Alex, the technician, came as scheduled and replaced the supply line and valve.  He also replaced the toilet with a new low flow one.  Both Alex and Mike (?) were professional and courteous.   They were quick and left the work area clean.  We had a slight leak and Alex came back and fixed it the same day.  This is the second time we have used this company.   We are quite pleased with the service and would recommend them to anyone who needs plumbing repairs.< /Review>

Evan was punctual courteous ,  explained well and gave options .
Armstrong I would recommend due to fact tech Evan
Was not only on time -and well within the 2 hour frame -but he was honest .
There was no pressure and I  certainly would use them again without any hesitation.
There was no high pitch sales or gimmick .</review>

Excellent customer service. Russell was fast, efficient and easy to work with. Armstrong was able to squeeze me in with only a couple hours notice. Have used Armstrong several times for my house that I rent and the duplex that I own and every time, they have been friendly, courteous and efficient. This is the second or third time that I have had Russell at one of my properties and each time, he has been great! Highly recommend!!<//Text>

It’s really hard to review his work since he didn’t do anything and just charged us for visit $160. He didn’t have tools to cut thru our bathtub to get to plumbing. But I didn’t appreciate weird personal comments. Not very profesional. Will definitely call someone else to fix our problem.<//Text>

I contacted Armstrong Plumbing for a clogged bathroom sink. They sent out their first tech and they were not able to fix the problem. The service tech informed me they would be sending me their specialist Ramon. I was a bit disappointed nobody followed-up with me like I was told. I however, called early the following week and Ramon showed up the following day. He was very professional and did a fast and efficient job. In less than 1 hour the clogged bathroom room sink was fixed. The 5 stars are really for Ramon’s service.< /Text>

This is our second time using Armstrong Plumbing, with the first time being from an old water heater.  For this service call we had a rusted outdoor line that was poorly installed from the past owners, a 1960's home with much need TLC.  Bruce and Jason did a wonderful job on the fix and we have WATER!  Thank you so much Armstrong Plumbing for the quick call and giving us some sanity in our lives.< /review>

Easily 5 stars! When I called Armstrong Plumbing yesterday and explained that both my washing machine and dishwasher were backing up into my kitchen sink and that I had company coming for five days next week, they schedule an appointment for 7:00-9:00pm last night and added that the technician they were sending was fast and one of their best and that he might call me to ask about coming earlier. Bruce called just after 5:30 and arrived shortly afterwords. He listened to my description and set to work. I checked the backup from the dishwasher last night and the washing machine this morning. No problems. I would definitely recommend Armstrong Plumbing for any plumbing needs;  professional employees and competitive rates.<//Review>

Sewage waste clogged a bathtub drain of an old rental unit.  Bruce was prompt, courteous, and professional. His arrival time was within the two hour window specified for the appointment.  I had previously attempted to remove debris from the side drain with a standard 25 foot snake but failed. Bruce brought out a 65 foot electric powered snake and was able to clear out the debris (a big, nasty hairball) easily and provided little tips on future maintenance of clogs.<//review>

<text>Bruce cane out to teplace my valve on the gas log fireplace.
I was unable do turn the valve die to weakness from arthritis in my hands. PG& E apparently did not verify if the valve was stuck or not and recommended teplacement based on my observations so I called Armstrong. Bruce came out and callede as I was inable to be there when the tenant scheduled the appointment. Armstrong took my payment info over the phone and send Bruce.
When he arrivef he called me and advised the valve was ok in working condition.
I trust Armstrong to do whats right and based on this experience I trust them as a tesult of Bruces honesty and integrity. I will use Armstrong in the future for all future plumbing needs.<//text>< pictures>

There is no way to overstate our satisfaction with Armstrong Plumbing, and especially with Peter Chappel's work and customer skills. We are doing an extensive home renovation that includes the kitchen and guest bath. We had originally contacted Armstrong Plumbing as one of three competitive bids. Peter did the initial review and estimate, and actually offered a helpful suggestion regarding the guest bath shower head height…and this was before we had chosen Armstrong to do the work!!! This was something that we never would have thought about, and became the deciding factor in choosing Armstrong.

In the interim, our primary contractor suggested a different plumber who would do the work at a lower cost, so we informed the three bidders as such. As renovation progressed, our contractor's plumber didn't work out, so we needed to find a plumber on short notice, as guest bath prep work needed to be completed before wall tile could be installed. We called Armstrong Plumbing, notifying them of our situation and immediate need. They politely, and quickly, scheduled Peter (at our request) to return.  He arrived a day later to install the bath shower valve, raised the shower head outlet, and installed new drain cap in the tub. He was astute enough to discover that the shower valve was damaged, so we arranged for a replacement; he returned later that afternoon to complete that installation.

Once the counter tops and wall tile were installed, we again requested Peter for the kitchen/bath completion. He arrived two days later, at the end of a long day for him, and promptly completed the necessary work, including his discovery that one of the bath sink faucets was leaking (yet another defective part!).

Throughout his work, we became better acquainted with Peter personally; he is very personable, humble, and his professionalism and work ethic are world class. We couldn't be happier with Peter, his work, and with Armstrong Plumbing. We're planning a master bedroom/bath suite renovation next year, and we will definitely call Armstrong…and absolutely request Peter.</text>

Kenny was thorough and provided a video of his findings. We originally had him for booked for 1.5 hours, but he said he finished the scope in half the time. He only charged us for half his time.

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>On Time and On Budget - George at Armstrong Plumbing did a great job for us. He replaced our service PRV which was malfunctioning and all three shower mixing valves because the hot and cold water in our house was mixing. He gave us an estimate last week (lowest bid of three contractors, but not overly low) arrived on time, did the work, was clean and respectful, and ended up charging the same price that was quoted. There is nothing more I would want from a plumber - good work, on time, on budget. Thanks George.< /Text>< pictures>

Armstrong Plumbing was recommended to me by a friend. We had a shower drain and toilet backup. Ramon was our service specialist and he was immediately personable and professional. He did an inspection, gave plenty of detailed information, and only did the amount of work that needed to be done. Based on Armstrong being personally recommended and furthermore based on Ramons excellent service I'll be using Armstrong again in the future. Thanks for your time and for giving my mom peace of mind!< /Text>

Armstrong Plumbing saved the day! Thank you Brooklyn for being so helpful & guiding me through this process. Forrest went above & beyond to correct another companies major screwup. He knew how stressed & worried I was about what had happened with my plumbing & was able to rid me of those worries. His apprentice Bruce is very fortunate to be trained by someone with integrity. This has been the best experience I have had with any home repair business. I had a botched Water Heater install by another business that left me without a solution. Having ZERO water in my Kitchen, Laundry, and only cold water in the tub is no fun 😩 Then being told by the owner of the company that did the hack job that it's my problem & to call a plumber is just wrong! Armstrong Plumbing gave me a detailed report of everything not up to code or permitted & identified that my water pressure/blockages were the direct result of an improper install. I appreciate an honest company who looks out for customers & strive to right the wrongs of those who give their industry a bad name. Thank you so much Forrest, Bruce & Brooklyn!! You are my go to for plumbing & I'll be recommending Armstrong Plumbing, without hesitation, to others 🤗

Highly recommend!! 👍👍👍👍👍</text>

George did and excellent job in diagnosing the problem, ordering the proper parts, and installing in a timely manner. He was up front about what would be required to get my problem fixed, and started the process of ordering the parts immediately. Thank you Armstrong Plumbing, will definitely use this company for any future plumbing issues.</text>

<Review>Jason from Armstrong arrived half an hour early and did an assessment of my newly installed Puronics water filtration system. He provided valuable information which I needed to determine if this system was actually the appropriate type as well as what are available as alternatives.. Furthermore he tested the hardness of the water from the well to make sure that I actually needed such a system.  This unbiased assessment and diagnostics is a true mark of professionalism on par with the best in the trade.< /Review>< pics>

On late Christmas evening we had a gross plumbing issue.  The back bathroom toilet got clogged and for some reason backed up into the two downstairs shower and toilets stopped flushing and also caused our laundry not to drain.  Thankfully we have a bathroom on a different plumbing system.  Armstrong came out the next morning and Greg T. assessed the situation and snaked the main line without complete success.  He then came in and snaked the shower that wasn't draining and success.  Plumbing has been working great throughout my home.  Greg was absolutely amazing, thorough, and determined to get the job done.  He kept me posted on what was going on as he worked.  As difficult as it was his goal was to not see his customer (right after Christmas) get hit with a big plumbing bill.  I have been a customer of Armstrong Plumbing for years and they are truly a very professional and friendly crew, from the office staff to the field staff.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ARMSTRONG PLUMBING!!!<//review>

We've had Jason from Armstrong Plumbing, as well as another of their journeymen out to our house for repairs and installations multiple times. They are prompt, courteous, professional, clean and respectful of our home every time they are here. They never leave a mess, everything always works the way it should, repairs are always expert and installations are neat and professional. They take pride in their work. We highly recommend Armstrong Plumbing.< /Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>I called Armstrong to change a leaking cartridge in my kitchen faucet. After several tries and some time, the "tech" informed  me that the cartridge was forever stuck.  Fair enough.  He DID try.  That's not my complaint.  I was charged the full price for a failed attempt.  Some money would have been fair, just not the full price.  I was left with a leaking faucet.  So I bought a new faucet and I will have it installed by another plumbing company; who as it turns out, charges less (much less) per hour.

< Review>
Mike C. and the apprentice he had with him, Danny, were fantastic! They were knowledgeable and displayed great communication skills. They described what they were going to do, what they found, and what needed to be done. I had a waste pipe that broke in the ceiling of the garage. Mike and Danny, together, were able to identify the leak quickly. They tested to see what "water devices" I could still use, took measurements, and Mike came back the next day to replace the broken joints.

Mike worked diligently. He was respectful of the billing time. In addition to his thorough work, I most appreciated him not trying to "up-sale" me. It is because of this approach that I will call Armstrong Pluming whenever I need plumbing services.

Mike C. and Danny were outstanding representatives of what honest service should be.< /Review>

I was referred to Armstrong years ago by a friend who told me "they're the best in town." She was right! I have called them for every plumbing job since. They're professional, prompt and skilled. Every plumber who has come out from Armstrong has a smile on his face and a can-do attitude for perfection. I honestly wouldn't use anyone else, ever!

They recently replaced my hot-water heater, and there was a problem with one of the parts -- a hose -- they were immediately out to replace the bad part with a different company's product. All good! Very happy customer. Thank you, Armstrong!</text>

I am very happy with the service Jason W. provided for us.  He installed two garbage disposals which are working wonderfully, but most importantly, fixed the drainage problem in our guest bathroom sink.  This was no small order in that Jason had to use his creative talents, time and time again, to finally solve the problem as to why the sink would not drain.  I would highly recommend this young man for any plumbing service.  He's personable, respectful, knowledgeable, helpful, and he doesn't give up on a problem!<//review>

Jacob was the plumber who recently installed a water heater at our home. We used Armstrong Plumbing in the past for some previous work and our experience was very pleasant. Jacob, who was the person for both of these jobs, was both professional and friendly. He explained exactly what he was going to do and followed through. He answered all of my questions and seemed to be well informed on all aspects of his job. I would not hesitate to use Armstrong Plumbing for any future work and would request the services of Jacob. He did a great job.<//Review>

Greg T. Installed new sink faucets in my two bathrooms. One of my countertops is very thick and would not accommodate one of the faucets I bought, so I had to return and exchange that one for a faucet that would work. Armstrong was very flexible in rescheduling the install early the following morning. Greg was on time, did a very good job, and cleaned the work area prior to leaving.< /review>

They answered and replied immediately to my inquiry, arrived in a timely manner when they said they would, and hustled during the time they were at my home performing the necessary work. As a very pleasant surprise, they even discounted the work they originally quoted me, a very significant amount! Their honest and hard-work ethic has been very impressive, the work they performed at my home is beyond satisfactory, and I will be a customer for life.<//Review>< pictures>

Peter C. and Armstrong Plumbing were STELLAR with their service and professionalism for me as I called on them to help out my mom and some plumbing problems she was having. Armstrong Plumbing's handling of my call was on point and Peter's face to face service, expertise, and friendliness was impressive and refreshing. Whenver we have plumbing service needs there is no one else we'll call than Armstrong Plumbing. THANK YOU!!<//review>

I didn't have a complex project...just a couple of shut-off valves and the installation of a new kitchen faucet.  Mark S arrived a little bit sooner than expected but surprised me when he was finished with the install & testing in about an hour and a half.
Efficient, tidy and with very pleasant demeanor. I've had excellent service from Armstrong since I bought my older Hollywood Park home 4 years ago.</text>

Peter C. arrived on time for a problem that we had in our bathroom. It only took him a few minutes to locate the area that was leaking. Soon after that he told us what the charges would be and he mentioned  a discount for seniors. We decided that it was ok for him to start and within a short period
he had one bathroom done. We asked him to repair the other bathroom also. He was very professional and keened up after the job was complete.</text>

I do not hesitate to recommend them to anyone I know when asked for a referral on plumbing work. They have a good rapport with the city of Sacramento as well, which allows them to get efficient and prompt help from the water/sewer department.

<Review>Armstrong plumbing is fantastic.  Best plumbing company in the Sacramento area.  Why do I say this? Because I have had the opportunity to hire several companies to deal with my plumbing problems, and ONLY Armstrong was able to take care of my serious plumbing problems. And they did so quickly and at much less cost than the other companies charged.</Review>< user>

Man, the technicians that come out are literally clueless and unlicensed. Two technicians came out and drilled a bolt over an existing bolt, damaged my floors (saying that they know how to do flooring but in reality, they don't).

These "good" reviews are a scam. They charged me on small caps and did a UNPROFESSIONAL job.</review>

<review>We called Armstrong Plumbing on the recommendation of an excellent long time property manager and real estate broker.  Our job was small, needing expert work due to the age of our home and it's pipes.  The courtesy and attention given us could not have been better had our job been large and very profitable.  George came and reviewed our needs, and offered some options I had not considered,. The bid came promptly the next day, and was quite fair.  Hana scheduled our appointment around our limited timing.  George arrived with an apprentice, Jorden (I believe) and it ws a pleasure to watch them work and to watch the teaching.  Our job was done well, our bathroom left clean, and we could not be more pleased.  I will not hesitate to recommend Armstrong to friends and clients, and will certainly use the from now on for any needs which might arise.</review><Gmap_id>0x809ad9edc52ffb6d:0xef85787feae79adf< /Gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

I immediately got a sense he really cared about his customer just from the way he carried himself. He was very confident and I felt he really cared about doing his best to be fair to me. He could have easily just installed a new disposal I had purchased on Angie's List from his company but he looked at the situation and informed me that he could salvage my current disposal with just replacing a part. I respected his honesty and sincerity in saving me over half the cost and being able to keep the better disposal I had. I thank him and he has gained my trust. If I ever need plumbing services in the future I will be sure to ask for him.

<Review>Called "Armstrong Plumbing" for a water heater estimate, after ours failed and leaked. Showed up as scheduled, they had the best bid, they also were able to get the oversized heater installed, before anyone else could even get the heater delivered, (that's important when you have no hot water :  ) Permits, code upgrades, all included. Will gladly recommend Armstrong Plumbing, and all of their staff!</Review>< gmapID>

Forest from Armstrong Plumbing went above & beyond to find the right faucet that fit the dimensions for my kitchen sink!  He was friendly & professional as he installed installed it, & looked for other possible leaks.
A previous plumber ordered a faucet for me without looking at the space  & when it didn't fit he wanted me to pay the restocking fees.  Forest made all the needed  measurements & took time to actually find the faucet at a very reasonable price!!  I will use Forest & Armstrong for my next plumbing job!!< /text>

I loved being able to text with Kate before making an appointment.  I told her the problem and was contacted quickly.  I got an appointment that was very convenient.
Peter called before he came to my home.  He was running late, but I never felt like he was rushing me.  He got to the root of the problem quickly.  He was very courteous and super knowledgeable.   I will definitely  use Armstrong Plumbing again.</text>

We decided to hire Armstrong Plumbing after looking through the great reviews on Angie's List. I called an set up an appointment which was scheduled for the same day at a convenient time 2 p.m to 5 p.m. I was told that if he could get there sooner someone would call. Peter called at 1:00 and said he was available. Peter arrived shortly thereafter and once he determined what the problem was, we reviewed the price list and he went straight to work.  The pricing was reasonable, I did not in anyway feel over sold nor pressured to get any "extra" services. Peter was friendly and provided great service! I will definitely hire them again for any plumbing needs.< /Review>

<pics>None</pics><Review>At my home Armstrong Plumbing took on one of the most inconvenient, difficult jobs they have encountered, displaying an exceptional work ethic, professional demeanor, and positive attitude -- even as the going got tougher and tougher. Their high tech diagnostic tools allowed me to see the problem for myself and concur with their solution. They were prompt and attentive to keeping the job site clean. Big problem solved. I highly recommend their services. Good people.< /Review><Name>Kathryn Marshall</Name><gmap_id>0x809ad9edc52ffb6d:0xef85787feae79adf< /gmap_id><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

John Huntington cleared all clogged house drains and the street drain quickly and professionally. The drains were each examined and cleared to prevent future problems. Armstrong was punctual which means a great deal with a house full of children and a couple of grandparents.<//review>

<Text>Ramon was amazing. Quick, efficient, INCREDIBLY polite. He made sure to call and give me an update on when he was going to be here, he was good about a mess, and he was also very enthusiastic to help.  I just moved back to sacramento and I've already texted my mother saying that if she has any plumbing issues I recommend Armstrong Plumbing (Hopefully Ramon).  Thank you for being a wonderful company with great trustworthy employees.</Text></record>

<Text>Had a very satisfying experience using Armstrong Plumbing to solve my plumbing problems at my home.  Plumber Mark Sherman provided excellent service, answered all of my questions, and was professional, pleasant and solved my drain issues.  I really appreciated the phone calls that kept me apprised of when I could expect the technician to arrive, so that I was not waiting around all day.< /Text><gmapID>0x809ad9edc52ffb6d:0xef85787feae79adf</gmapID><rating>5</rating>< Name>

Good experience with Armstrong Plumbing who are located in Sacramento.
Needed to replace a hot water heater which was located in the attic.
Armstrong's estimate was competitively priced and their installation /  service was excellent.

<pics>None<//pics><Review>Mark from Armstrong Plumbing was outstanding and professional!!  His service was prompt and he was very knowledgeable and cheerful. When he was finished with the job in the kitchen, I asked him if he had time to fix the faucets in the bathroom and also remove an old refrigerator water line.  He took care of both issues almost immediately and without hesitation.  Because of his professionalism and great demeanor, we have decided to use Armstrong for all of our plumbing needs in the future.  I am sure we will ask specifically for Mark...<//Review>< Name>

These guys were great, and the folks at the office were really helpful and friendly.  They called to check on the status of the leak we had to see if I still needed help after I told them I wanted to call around.  Cheers!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Review regarding Jacob from Armstrong Plumbing. He was absolutely great. He came to assess our leaking water heater. Turns out that we have a direct vent type of water heater and required numerous phone calls before finding the appropriate replacement. He spent the time to track down a heater that was configured to work in our space. He spent over 8 hours to make it work, including building out a platform extension for the new water heater (which he did not anticipate and did not charge us additional cost). He was very personable, clear in his explanations, and was a pleasure to work with.

Quality of his work was superb. He paid attention to details. Afterwards he cleaned up the garage (his work area) so that it was cleaner than when he arrived.

If everyone who works for Armstrong Plumbing is like Jacob, then I would highly recommend the company and certainly Jacob.</Text>

Greg T. came out, and within a few minutes, discovered that the leak was actually coming from the rear bathroom lavatory shutoff valve that had not been tightened sufficiently. What impressed me even more than finding the problem, was Greg's meticulousness in checking for any other possible leaks. Greg was competent, professional, and courteous.

This afternoon we noticed a leak in our outside faucet.  I called Armstrong Plumbing and Joe A was assigned to our request. Joe was right on time (in fact, early) and his pride of workmanship showed.  He is a seasoned plumber and a true professional.  He repaired the leak by installing better fixtures and answered our questions thoroughly.  Next time, we have any issues with our plumbing, I will be calling not only Armstrong, but will be name requesting Joe A.<//text>

They did a great job, worked hard the whole time, were very professional, and left the site as clean as they found it.  Water pressure and availability of hot water are much improved, and its great not having to worry about the old pipes failing.  They also made sure we had hot and cold running water and at least 1 bathroom available each night. My only quibble would be that the crew were only here for about 6 hours a day (including lunch break) for the first 2 days of what was estimated to be a 3 day project, then had to work extra hours on days 3 and 4 plus half a day on day 5 to finish up.  We had to board our dogs for the duration of the project, so the extra days were a bit of a hardship.<//Text>< date>

<review>Kenneth B. was very friendly, courteous and professional.  Good job Kenny.  However, presenting a bill based on the more expensive estimated cost rather than the less expensive actual cost of labor plus materials was deceitful at best and possibly fraudulent. If that's the company policy it should be reported to authorities for prosecution.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

We had Armstrong Plumbing install a water heater.  Peter C from Armstrong came a little early and left a little late to get some unforeseen problems solved.  He did not even charge me for the extra work.  Peter did a great job and was friendly and easy to be around.  The water heater works considerably better than our old one even though it is the same model. Thumbs up for Armstrong!< /Text>

Problems involving water where you don't want it can get serious quickly. I called Armstrong and they set up and appointment for the next day. I received a call back soon after saying that someone could be here in an hour.  I gratefully accepted. Ramon  arrived shortly and resolved my problem with clogged exterior drains (plural) in under 2 hours. Prior to starting he thoroughly explained the procedure and prior to leaving he cleaned up anything related to his job and even rolled up the hose which was used to test a drain and was not rolled up when he arrived.  He did all this with a great attitude.  If I need a plumber I now know who to call.< /Text>

Laird arrived on time, inspected everything and gave me choices as to the extent of repairs to be done.  The work agreed upon was done as fast as possible and my kitchen was clean and everything works again.  The price was very reasonable and I will use Armstrong Plumbing in the future.</review>

My water heater started leaking on Saturday afternoon. The water started pooling fast and lots of it. I called a dozen plumbers in a panic, and most didn't pick up. The few who did weren't available until Monday. Armstrong Plumbing allowed me to book an appointment online from Yelp instantly and answered their phone on a Saturday afternoon! A few hours later Peter arrived with a brand new water heater in his truck. He worked hard to remove the old one and installed the new one, working late on a Saturday night! Thank you so much Peter, we'll sleep well tonight knowing our water heater isn't leaking into our house and walls!!< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I can't begin to tell you what amazing service I had with Jason from Armstrong Plumbing. We recently moved to Sacramento from Visalia and moved our washer and dryer hoping to save some money. He problem solved SO MANY different issues that we were confronted with while learning our gas dryer wouldn't work after all, and even after it had been stacked by an uneducated plumber. He came back to our house 2 different times to make sure the job was done correctly and only charged us the bare minimum and only for 1 visit. He even moved our old dryer down our awful windy stairs and helped set up the new dryer we had to purchase from Home Depot. I have had to use plumbers numerous times in the past but never have I had an experience with a plumber so easy to work with and so knowledgable. Needless to say I would HIGHLY recommend Jason W at Armstrong Plumbing.<//Text>< pictures>

If you'er looking to have a drain cleaned there okay. I had them do a re-pipe on my house in Arden manor. 2 failed inspections, on the third is finally passed) and 2 weeks after they said they would have it complete the hack job is finished.

DO YOUR RESEARCH ON YGRENE. They -Armstrong will sell it as the best thing for you with the 1st payment out a year or more with great interest "6.99%" rates. The admin fees are crazy and bump the interest rate to more than 11%   A 10k -10yr loan was going to cost me 16k at term.< /Review>

One of our toilets was leaking and needed to be resealed. I called Armstrong Plumbing to see what appointments they had available and to get an estimate. Luckily they were able to send a technician out at an earlier time than my appointment (they called me to "ok" it). Technician Justin V. was sent to help us. He was polite, efficient, courteous and professional. Don't be fooled by those innocent blue eyes of his! He knows what he's doing. He did the job in less time than was estimated over the phone and the total cost was much less than the phone estimate. He even fixed the little obnoxious "wiggle" that toilet has had for 4 years (no charge). It wiggles no more and it's better than ever. Justin V. has a great work ethic. He cleaned up as he worked. I would give him 5 stars but I'm cautious and reserved by nature. I'm sure I'll give the 5 star rating after our second positive experience. I look forward to calling on Armstrong Plumbing for future services.< /text>

Our second experience with Armstrong Plumbing. First time was changing drain pipes in the kitchen under the foundation, then trenchless replacement of sewage line from house to street. Both time we received fair quotes and the work was completed as promised. Michael D led the second two man team, and they were great. Staying late to get the job done in one day as scheduled. They also sent someone back, as promised, to pick up a huge block of old cement they had dug up. Armstrong will continue to be my plumbing company of choice. Honest good work!< /review>

<text>We had a clogged drain in our older house on a Saturday morning. I called at just after 9 AM. The woman that answered the phone was polite and helpful, and gave us two service windows for later that day. I chose one from 11AM-2PM. She told us that the plumber would call before coming over. Mike M. called at 1:30 or so and said he'd be there in 10 minutes. When he arrived, he was also very personable, polite and helpful, answered all our questions, had our drain cleared quickly and efficiently, and even added a quick-release cap to our drain cleanout at no extra charge. All told, our experience with Armstrong was pleasant, professional, and reasonably priced, especially on a weekend. Highly recommended!</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x809ad9edc52ffb6d:0xef85787feae79adf< /gmapID></record>

I was very happy with Armstrong Plumbing!! Woke up to my toilet leaking all over my bathroom on a Saturday.  I called a ton of plumbers but either I had to leave a message or they were booked until Wednesday. At about 3pm I was freaking out I hadn't heard back from anyone and there is only one toilet in my house so I needed someone pronto.  I called Armstrong plumbing and they said they could come in 30min!!! Mike M came to my rescue and even fixed a few other problems I had with my toilet and faucet while he was here.  He was super nice, fast, and did quality work.  He was even concerned that one of my cats might have gotten out of the house (it didn't but it was awesome that he cared).  Thank you Armstrong Plumbing and especially Mike, I will be using you in the future for sure!!!!<//text>

Scheduled a estimate for a new electric water heater for Friday April 27th. Bruce was on time and was informative and presented my options where previous companies did not. I didnt get the sense that this company is in business just to make money or the quick buck. He stated he would do the estimate Monday morning (4/30) and email it to me. 5/1 i still haven't received my estimate which is unfortunate. I now feel like I wasted my time with the appointment  Probably have to call and request my estimate. If they have to come back out I'll cancel.< /Text>

Bruce was the plumber that came to our home. Bruce was running early and called me to ask if that was okay. When he arrived we had 4 separate plumbing problems and he managed to blaze through the first three fixing them all within an hour. The entire time he was courteous, and kept me informed of what was going on. The fourth problem had to do with a broken pond auto-fill mechanism. He did not have the parts to repair that but he gave me a suggestion on how I might be able to jerry-rig a a repair myself. His idea worked! I will use Armstrong again and hope I get a chance to work with Bruce again.</text>

<Text>My clients purchased their first home. They wanted the plumbing inspected. Armstrong plumbing did an excellent job. The inspector found some issues and wrote a detailed report including pricing to correct the issue. Since the price to repair the problem was so reasonable, the seller agreed to have it fixed by Armstrong. Happy seller, happy buyer and a happy Realtor! Thank you guys for the great service.

<text>Mark called me and said he was on the way, arrived on time and introduced himself in a nice professional manner. He got to work right away to fix my hot water heater. He tested it out and found the problem. It was a complicated fix, but Mark figured it out and fixed it perfectly. He had the part that I needed, so I didn't have to get a hold of the company to have them send it. He took care of everything. He also put in a brand new bathroom facet for me and made sure that everything was to perfection and cleaned up any mess that he made. Mark was professional, great to talk to and explained everything that he was doing and any questions I had, he answered. He was honest and fair and Armstrong is lucky to have such a great employee. I will continue to use Armstrong Plumbing when needed as long as there are employees like Mark. Thank You Mark for all that you did for me, I do appreciate it.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Armstrong Plumbing’s team, led by Peter Chappell, did an excellent job in repiping my house from old galvanized steel pipes to copper. They had expertise to handle whatever issues arose and did the entire job in a workmanlike manner. In addition, they were very professional in responding to all my concerns and in showing great respect for me, the homeowner, in accommodating my requests during the service. To cap it off, their bid actually came in lower than other contractors, with far less experience , who also bid the job. I would definitely recommend Armstrong Plumbing and Peter Chappell for any plumbing need.</Review><user>111885062803786549280<//user><Date>1519333437329<//Date></record>

<review>We had a main line blockage that started Friday night, but it didn't fully stop water flow until Saturday afternoon around 2 PM. We had difficulties locating a licensed plumbing company that was open on Saturday, let alone late enough to avoid emergency rates. We contacted Armstrong Plumbing and was assured by their customer service rep that their technician, Jason, would be able to locate and solve the problem quickly. She was very patient and quoted their likely emergency rates, which started at 4 (the time they closed). She was convincing enough for me to set a tentative appointment for the 5-7 window. Their technician called us in less than an hour to let us know he'd be able to arrive earlier. He showed up and located an old, buried cleanout and cleared the blockage, which turned out to be roots from the front yard. From start to finish, it took about two hours (we recently bought the house, which was made in the 1960s, and knew nothing about it, so he had to locate the main sewer line, which was buried under concrete and rocks under bushes). When he was done, he provided quotes for installing a proper cleanout and replacing the main line, as well as gave me ideas if I just wanted to make a riser above the old cleanout myself. As he was able to arrive before their closing time, and as a first-time customer favor, he charged us straight time, which saved us a nice chunk of change. For the first professional plumbing experience I've had in my adult life (been a renter for 18 years previously), it was surprisingly quick and painless. I don't normally leave reviews, but it's the least I can do for Jason. Thanks, dude.<//review><Rating>5</Rating><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

What a great experience I had a few weeks ago, with Laird.  He came to my rental to fix a leaky kitchen sink.  Within minutes he had the source of the problem figured out, and fixed it!  He didn't try and tell me I needed other, unnecessary services and repairs done with the sink, like other companies have done in the past.  I felt I was given an honest, fair evaluation and price for the work that was needed.  I would highly recommend Armstrong Plumbing, and Laird, for anyone's plumbing needs.  I KNOW I will use them in the future, both at my rental and my own house that I love in.  Thank you Laird!!<//review>

Joe rebuilt my kitchen faucet that's been working since I bought my house 40 years ago. The model is discontinued and it mounts on a backsplash covered in tile installed in 1927. I was very concerned about finding a replacement that would work with the existing set up after spending the weekend unsuccessfully searching the internet. My imagination was working overtime. Kudos to Joe for saving the day.< /text>

<Review>Armstrong pluming is the best as far as the Sacramento area goes! the technicians were at my place 5 min before scheduled appointment time (always prefer a few min before insted of later).  The price of labor was not bad and the costumer service was wayyyy better then some of the other local companies. I would highly recommend Armstrong Plumbing and I will definitely be using them in the feature!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Woke up Saturday morning to flooded kitchen floor and hallway outside bathroom. Contacted landlord, who contacted Armstrong Plumbing. Michelle called me within 30 minutes of my initial call, scheduled a plumber for between 11am - 1pm. Mike B. called early to say he was on his way. He was fantastic! Figured out the water heater was shot, so had to go get a new one. Also knew he had another scheduled job, so told us what he was doing and when he would be back.
He came back in late afternoon, stayed and got the job done; it wass not an easy job, as space is quite constrained, but he was persistent even as he ran into obstacles, and probably put in an unusually late evening of work to get it done. He kept his cool and was very professional in tough circumstances! A great guy who dealt very well with a tough situation, and got us back on track much sooner than might have been expected!<//review>

<Text>I had the guys come out to an elderly lady's home and repair the broken sewer line. They worked with my schedule, they were asked not to speak to the elderly woman because the stress would be too much for her. They were so great about sticking to the guidelines we had set for them. The cost was affordable. They gave a bid for the work needed; not a lot of work that was not necessary. They are honest, dependable, and hard working.

< Review>
I called Armstrong Plumbing along with two other companies to have my water main replaced after it broke when the city was installing the water meter. Dan came and checked things over and sent me a estimate shortly after that. The estimate was much better than the estimates we received from the other two companies, so we chose Armstrong. Everything went smoothly. The repair job was scheduled and the guys showed up on time and the whole replacement went seamlessly. The job was done shortly after the building inspector cleared the work and the entire process was completed in two days. This was a trenchless replacement so there was very little disturbance of our landscaping. I will not hesitate to call them again for any future plumbing jobs.</Review>

<review>I first noticed my shower pipes "knocking" a few yrs ago...a few plumbing companies said it would cost $2000 or more to tear out the tile and fix the problem. Finally, I found David from Armstrong Plumbing on Angie's List and fixed the problem for less than $100. That was about a year ago, and everything is still working fine. I was amazed and delighted to have found an honest company.

Recently, I heard some "knocking of pipes" when the auto sprinkler system shut off. The first Armstrong tech came out, checked...and said he'd like another technician to take a second look at no charge...David came out and checked the system...to detect the problem and offer the right solution. This is the type of company that will keep a customer coming back & back again.< /review><user_name>Cecile DeCuir< /user_name>< rating>

The repair to my gas line was completed today by Plumber Mark of Armstrong Plumbing. Mark arrived on time, and went right to work. The estimator had thoroughly explained the job to Mark so he knew what he needed to do. The job took less than an hour and the price was very reasonable. I have spent hours worrying about this gas leak. Prior to working with Armstrong, I called 4 other plumbing companies that did not want to bother with this job. One other company sent a "plumber" out who had no tools and no idea what to do to find and fix the problem. Working with Armstrong Plumber I felt reassured that they would resolve my gas leak and they did.<//review>

Mark came within the scheduled window, worked efficiently, communicated what we was doing, and cleaned up well.  He cut out and replaced an old brass fitting connecting a bathroom sink p-trap with the waste pipe, which appeared a little tricky.</review>

I found Armstrong plumbing online and called them to replace the grout around the tile on my bath tub.  Joe came and looked at the tub as I explained that we had done the grouting twice already in the last year and a half.  He told me the reason why it was a problem and said he could do it but it would keep being a problem if I didn't fix the way the tile was put on.  He suggested I get the tile fixed by another company and have it done right.  He did not charge me and I appreciate his honesty!  I will be calling them back for any plumbing I need in the future!  Thanks Joe / Armstrong Plumbing< /text>

Mike came out to hydrojet our line.  He told us how he would want to do it but we told him, from experience, our way was the way it should be done.  Instead of saying that it would cost more or that he had to call his office, like some of your competition would do, he agreed.  He did a great job.  He had an interest in the job and always had a smile, and this was in 100 degree heat.  If we need your service again, I will ask for him.

<rate>4</rate><Text>The only reason this isn't five stars is that I want to be sure the recent repair holds, and that the further repairs I have scheduled for next week work out. But I want to give kudos to this company, because a few months ago, we had an emergency plumbing problem, and the company we paid IN ADVANCE for first-in-line service said they couldn't come for days (not the first time it had happened).  My husband tried Armstrong, and the man who answered talked him through some steps that solved the problem (a clog in the kitchen sink).  At no charge.  Stay tuned for an update!

Update:  The app won't let me add a fifth star above, but I would if I could.  Greg came on time and did a great job fixing the issues that other plumbers had either jerry-rigged or ignored.  Thanks!<//Text>< pics>

<Date>1459873275714< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><text>On 2/24/2016 you sent out two “Techs” to check on a water leak in the planter area near my water meter. They dug a shallow hole next to the meter about a foot and a half deep and two shovels width wide. They proded around in the dirt and had no clue as to where the water was coming from. Your bill stated it took one person ½ hour and the other 3.5 hours.  I watched and quite frankly was less than assured that they knew what they were doing. When questioned neither had any idea as to where the water was coming from. They compiled a very costly estimate to the tune of $6435. Based on what I saw, I called in another company to evaluate the problem and give me a bid to repair the leak.  Within minutes of arriving they located the leak on the other side of the water meter. As stated in my email, the job was done in 2.5 hours for the total cost of $2500 by the Trenchless co.
I really don't believe that Armstrong is a dishonest company in doing plumbing repairs but you do have a problem.
I was watching the 2 people doing the investigative work (that term is being generous)   the short time they were there and what they did was not reassuring my confidence. I am convinced that they did not have a clue as to how to deal with the problem at hand and they over estimated the cost to compensate and cover their behinds. Something to thing about with respect to training and estimating job costs.

Following the Feb. 6 Email that I sent you, I received a response from customer service indicating they would check into it and contact me. Since then have not heard a word.
I did however received a bill for $675.00 to “locate water leak” near my water meter. Keep in mind they did not locate the water leak. Check your invoice #56532.  They came up with some cockamamie estimate that had no credibility. I refuse to pay this bill. If you want to pursue it further feel free, I am very disappointed in what occurred. I will remind you that I had considerable work done by your company in suite B. Now I question the legitimacy of those expenditure as well. I will not do business with your company again.

<review>I have used Armstrong for minor plumbing problems to major plumbing repairs, as well as other complicated projects (sewer line replacements, installation of new water lines, etc.). In my experience, they are professional, competent, and honest in their repairs, maintenance, and new work.< /review>< Pictures>

Sadly, not worth the time. The greeters are super nice and helpful but it ends there. The store is small so they don’t carry all the product lines like their larger stores. No one is around to help with sampling making it impossible to try a color. Lastly they’re always out of the “popular” colors. I’ll just drive an extra mile or two to another store.< /Text>

The store closed before 8pm on Saturday, 2/17, which both Google and their phone line report as the closing time. I arrived at 7:45 pm to find that the store was closed.</review>

<review>Worst quality control ever. They gave me a foundation that had already expired 3m ago in store. And when I noticed it they didn’t apologize and placed an online order, which arrived with only 2m before expiration. You could simply put something out of stock, but trying fooling and cheating with customer is inexcusable.<//review>< pictures>

<text>Was greeted nicely upon entry but the cashier was very dismissive of me as a customer. He never told me how many points I had without having to ask. He also didn’t offer me a chance to purchase a bag for my items, he just slid it back to me under the plastic cage and moved on to the next customer.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>during the covid-19 crisis, this store is very keen on following social distancing and sanitation guidelines, ensuring all customers sanitize hands, wear masks, and know to social distance before they enter the store.

i've visited this location several times and have mixed experiences each time. depending on who i interact with, service here is either ok, good, or terrible. most of the employees do a fine job of being respectful, but almost half the time i run into someone who is maybe tired but simply doesn't seem to be in the mood to be helpful or attentive at checkout.

that being said, i have had decent experiences with the advisors on the floor and with tricky situations with special promotions, returns, etc. requiring routine escalation at the register.

the store is huge and spacious so it's perfect to browse in, but service doesn't seem to be attentive at this location. emeryville is smaller but i've had somewhat better experience there so far. or just order online :(</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>First time walking into this store and from the jump it was such a terrible experience. I am a manager for retail so I know what the expectations are for customer service. I was not greeted by the person at the door, he looked my way but did not bother to ask what I needed or what I was looking for. I tried making eye contact to see if he would bother to help me, but he just continues to acknowledge everyone else but me. I felt so discriminated and left out that I would not step foot in that store again. The representative's name was Angel. Such a terrible experience!< /Review>< Pictures>

This is a good Sephora in a convenient location. The employees are also very polite and helpful. I couldn’t have asked for more. There's a large selection of foundations, blushes, lipsticks, lipglosses, eyeshadow palettes, false lashes, eye liners, lip liners, men's and women's perfumes, skin care, beauty blenders, makeup remover, and other goodies. There's even a little screen here called "Sephora Virtual Artist". I've never seen it at any other location, but basically it has a camera and lets you digitally see what different makeup would look like on you.</text>

Welcome to Sephora Berkeley.  Great location at the old Crate and Barrel Outlet location next to the Amazon store.  All services available... Beautiful location next to food and other retailers.  Much upgraded from the Emeryville store.
Only issue might be parking but it is going to be that way for the area.
The advisors are all friendly and knowledgeable and the checkout was quick.  Love the experience.<//Text>

Awesome customer service, super friendly. But most of all if they don't know the answer they will refer to someone who can.<//text>

Decent stock and they've cleaned the place up a bit since I was there months ago (when it was downright gross). Accepting assistance from any of the "experts" is hit or miss. One young woman asked if needed help finding anything so I told her what I was looking for. She asked another staff member and then told me they don't cary "anything like that". Later on another woman offered me help and she miraculously lead me to exactly the type of product I was looking and wound up purchasing so I was happy about that. Side note, the tall curly top dude at checkout, with enough apathy to choke a horse, can't wait to show you how little cares for you, running over me on script (which by now is rote for him) without once looking me in the face and making sure I noticed. "Have a nice day". I'm impressed by how jaded you are dear.< /review>

They want to charge you extra for old soup and Basil. There’s pho soup used to be really good but I don’t know what happened it just has gone downhill. Poor service and expensive for the nasty pho. No more food for me there!!!</review>

<Text>Closes at midnight and we had just come into the area from WA and it was 10pm already. I had contracted a bug on the plane and knew I needed some hot ginger soup. Maxim's had exactly what I needed! They called it rice porridge but Filipinos call it arrozcaldo and it was so satisfying! I asked for ginger and they added extra I think. The staff were really super nice and they had no problem refilling the hot water for my jasmine tea. All the food was delicious!!!</Text></record>

<Review>Been going here almost 17 years and it’s always been amazing. The customer service is always awesome and I can’t get enough of the Mongolian Beef with a bowl of Wonton Soup. Open until midnight every night. Every person I have brought here loves it and craves it. I moved away and every time I come back it’s the first place I go to. I’ve eaten here for lunch and dinner in the same day multiple times.<//Review><user>104502588881110729472</user><name>JP Dinnell</name></record></dataset><record>

Very nice mixture of Vietnamese and Chinese food. Normally I see a lot of over salting and oil but their food was really good. I especially enjoyed their house soup and clay pot fish.</text>

One of the best Chinese restaurants in San Diego. My family has been going here since my parents found out they were pregnant with me. Their Mongolian Beef is the best you will find anywhere we always order two plates. The Claypot special is outstanding. their chow fun is yummy!! I recommend this restaurant. Also try their black bean crab.</text>

Friendly staff and I discovered via a recommendation of the San Diego Reader's Barbara Barbarella Fokos, I went there because she and her mother raved about the takeout Cantonese style food that they used to order back in New York City. Likewise for me, gone for take out twice, haven't been disappointed; just five blocks away I have been transported back to my childhood Cantonese restaurants' high quality back in Boston. Superb menu and reasonable prices. Also serves Tsing Tao beer which is never a bad thing.</Review>

< Review>
What did I like......hmmmm nothing. The food was gross. And uncooked. I was looking for a decent place to eat late at night everything looked good till I got back to my hotel. Eating my kung pao chicken it was very undercooked and chewy. Gave the lady a call and back she did nothing to make the experience great. She offered me a new one but reminded me they close at 12 and wouldn't wait for me to pick it up again. I do not recommend this place to anyone take your money else where.</Review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>I've been to so many seafood places and I decided to try this one not good. In most places they clean out the poop on the shrimp I would think so for paying $10.+.  for a large shrimp cocktail no avocado it's extra and $1.75 for a can of coke. Then to add the finale I asked to use the girls restroom and it's just a stall inside the kitchen area yeah never going back to this place....< /Text></record>

<Date>1478038035648< /Date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>I grew up in this town. I left this place in the late 80s so I didn't  know where to find good places to eat around here anymore. My family referred me to this place so I checked it out. I went on a Sunday and they had a live Sinaloense band playing. It was like walking into banda club. The music was a bit loud. Everyone looked at me like I was out of place. I guess everyone knows the regulars here. No one tried to intimidate me or stare me down though. The waitresses were really nice. They had an assorted menu to choose from. I had their shrimp coctel and a couple of ceviche tostadas and a michelada. Their coctel was great. Their ceviche tostadas were also great. They serve their micheladas in a large caguama (family size if you are not familiar with the term) size Styrofoam cup with ice in it. I have never been served a michelada like this before. At first I thought, this michelada is going to suck. Beer is nasty with ice in it. Man was I in for a surprise. The michelada was the best michelada I had in my life! I am not exaggerating. I have had plenty of micheladas and this one was the best tasting one hands down. After having two of the micheladas the music wasn't so loud anymore. In fact, the music was not as loud as I would have liked it to be. I was having a blast with my family. I had dancing feet listening to the new school sinaloense banda music. I grew up listening to the old school Jalisco bandas like Banda Machos, Banda Cuisillos, Banda Pelillos and others. Good music is good music. These guys were killing it with the music.

In the end, I enjoyed the visit here. The tab for four people's meals and beers and a bucket of beer I treated a nearby table to was less than one hundred bucks. You can't beat that. I will definitely visit this place again when I am in town. I highly recommend giving this place a try.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2cd203c47f555:0x7eec3ed5cf91cfec<//gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) The food is two teas, but the prices if they are a little expensive, you need to come once so that you realize yourself.
Food its ok but it's a little overpriced.

This store has the most amazing staff, is super clean and cared for on the inside,  however that ends at the door. For those of us that live in the neighborhood and like to walk to get our groceries you know what I’m talking about. The trash filled shopping carts that sit for weeks and weeks untouched and uncollected is just unacceptable! I wish Ralph’s cared about its surroundings community enough to take the extra time to collect these eye scores on a daily basis. This would definitely move them to the 5/5 stars ⭐️</Text>

This is my neighborhood Ralph’s, and my go-to grocery store. They renovated their store a couple years ago, adding a sushi bar, Starbucks coffee and really vamping up their bakery selection.

I love this grocery store because they have an excellent mix of high-end retailers mixed with your typical American retailers. Meaning, you’re sure to find anything you need here.

I trust their meats - and I appreciate how they carry bones for me to make bone broth.

Their produce section is always beaming with fresh fruit and vegetables. They do a really good job at carrying seasonal vegetables, and finding sources to be able to carry things like berries all year round.

Bathrooms are clean, and there is tons of parking in the front and back of the store.< /text>

<text>AMAZING! Their store always well-stocked and never lack stocks. The employees were very friendly and helpful, too. They had a very reasonable and fair price compared to other markets in the city. They have fresh veggies, fruits, and meat. The place is nice, too and well-organized. It was the best experience always!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><user_name>Tonya Evans</user_name><user>115681439443622716326<//user>< gmap_id>

<text>Visiting this supermarket was the best decision ever! I was able to find all the stuff I need at home. It was a clean and neat place to do some shopping with canned food. Their offered assistance was trustworthy. I admired their people who accommodated my concerns professionally as expected. Thank you so much to all of you!<//text>< gmapID>

This Ralph's is next door to the Custom Hotel where I had to spend the night on a missed connection.  Rather than eat at a restaurant by myself, I grazed at the Ralph's, which has the greatest staff I've ever seen in a supermarket.  I bought a deli sandwich, and the checker gave me an honorary Ralph's card resulting in a dollar off.  Happened a second time too when I told the checker I didn't want a Ralph's card since I wasn't a local.  As well, I watched another checker do a larger order in front of me, and her hands were a blur at the scanner.  You wouldn't believe it.  I told her it's the fastest work I'd ever seen.  She smiled and said, "They want us to be fast".  No need to hunt for an express line at Ralph's with these ultra-speedy checkers.  Maybe there's a checker olympics.  Anyway, I'm delighted that this Ralph's happened to be next door to my hotel, and it made my missed connection a much better experience.<//review>

<Text>This supermarket is indeed the best when it comes to providing products and its services. I'm so thankful because this place truly has it all. From imported products and many more. I was really having the best time here because the place was so amazing and everything else was perfect. Good job, everyone! Thank you so much!<//Text>< pics>

Good selection of products,  good prices, clean, friendly store management team. The card readers at self-checkout  are in need of replacing,  as the machines often malfunction with cards. The store has been improving.</Text>

<Review>My local Ralph's (3rd Street, mid-city) used to be terrible: horrible service, rude employees, no help in sight, sticky floors...  But this one is always clean and the staff is terrific.  My mom shopped here until she passed away and knew several checkers by name.  And once, long ago, I met Howie Long walking out of the store (it was a Lucky's back then) with his wife when the Raiders were in LA.  He had to duck and walk through the door sideways, but he made it (barely).   I said, "Hey, Howie!" and he didn't kill me, which I took for a good sign.<//Review>< resp>

Was good. Well-maintained nice little warm lighting not the bright neon of some other supermarkets. Good selection of organic fruits everything was available the crew is very friendly and helpful even at the self-checkouts. And during lunch time to sushi there is well priced.

The baskets are scattered throughout the store so most of the time you have to embark on a scavenger hunt just to find one (not even exaggerating!)

gave them 2 stars because sometimes they sell 2 12 packs of 805 for $24.< /review>< Gmap_id>

<text>I needed a last minute cake for my brother in law and fortunately I was helped by the store manager here. Such a sweet lady and sympathetic. I picked out a cake and right after she got going on the frosting writing down "Happy Birthday Joe!". Rang me up as soon as she finished and I was on my way. Less than 5 minutes I was in and out. I dont remember her name but it was excellent service.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The produce is the best in the area. The produce staff is helpful and knowledgeable, and they take great pride in their work. The management makes sure to call in extra checkers if there's ever a wait, and sometimes they pitch in, too. Also, the checkers are almost all really friendly, so it's a pleasure to shop here.<//text>

<Text>Decent store, albeit smaller than the other Ralphs' I've been to. But it's my local supermarket and it's convenient. Despite its smaller size it still has everything I need--size isn't everything, ha. :) Seriously though, there's no pharmacy, the deli is sort of small, and the other non grocery stuff you find at other supermarkets (including the other Ralph'ss like 2 mi away) probably isn't here.

It's organized, but sometimes seems a little dingy and I don't think there's a lot of care put into maintaining the shelves and deli area. It's a little expensive but there are some great deals with a club card membership thing.  The liquor aisle is always well stocked and kept clean, haha.

Employees...some of them are absolutely amazing and could easily work at a top tier exclusive hotel or something of that ilk. They go out of their way to help and always have time to chat. They're efficient, kind, helpful and generous. This is why I'm not giving it the 3 stars it would deserve should employees be taken out of the equation. There are other employees who do the bare minimum, of course. It's like a 5050 split.

Final score is 3.4<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

Friendly staff. Great well-known low prices. Fresh seafood choices. And my favorite, Ralph's in general carries specific brands that others don't. Now let's talk "Whoo Hoo..."</text>

I just called the Deli Dept. twenty minutes ago about how late they make Boar's Head sandwiches and was told 7:30pm. I get down here and am told their cooling system is not working and no sandwiches can be made. Bad service. I always feel like a villain ordering sandwiches here because they are understaffed. Poor service. Bristol Farms from now on.</Review>

<review>Went there today ( Saturday afternoon) parking lot packed, a lot of people, went to the deli got what I needed and a couple of other things, got up to the line, they only had two lines open and they were long, asked if we could open another lane, was told NO. Then on top of it there was a spill just as you get to the register blocking everything, asked if I could go around, told I need to wait, put my stuff down and walked out.

Some cashiers are really friendly,  while others don't acknowledge you while you are checking out. He store is very clean and organize. It's a small store but they have a large organic section.</Review>

Live here locally, the reasons why the ratings are low because they have very little here. I don't like that they only sell shampoos and conditioners for certain hair types. They don't really service the WHOLE COMMUNITY. Im positive whites aren't the only ones washing their hair in Westchester. Hopefully one day they'll get a section and give us some products lol. Next the customer service is mediocre. I've needed help with balloons and the workers ignored me then rudely asked me if I needed help. My reply would've been very rude if I was in a different mood.  There are mostly good experiences over bad but just a heads up incase it's not goos< /text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very nice store, customer parking seems fair.
Inside it looks like monoprix Gourmets the choice is important but the share of fresh products is of course smaller than with us there is everything. Little dairy butter cheese cream .... unlikely products like minced turkey, or canned tuna called 'chicken of the sea'
There is of course Nutella (made in Mexico) and the famous' the laughing cow 'as well as' pasteurized French brie' of course 'from president.
The bottle of champagne at 59.99 dollars which is affordable 10,000km from Reims, when it is in restaurants in Limoges at 80 dollars for 550 km from Reims.
Red meat is expensive a small American prime rib at 32 dollars it is for tomorrow noon.
The excellent pork ribs in barbecue sauce cost $ 16 for 5 people.

(Original)
Très joli magasin, le parking clientèle semble juste.
A l intérieur cela ressemble à monoprix Gourmets le choix est important mais la part aux produits frais est bien sûr plus réduite que chez nous il y a de tout. Peu de produits laitiers beurre fromage crème....des produits improbables,  comme du haché de dinde, ou du thon en boîte appelé ' chicken of the sea'
Il y a bien sûr du Nutella (fabriqué au Mexique) et la fameuse 'the laughing cow' ainsi que du 'french brie pasteurisé' of course' de chez président.
La bouteille de champagne à 59.99 dollars ce qui est abordable à 10.000km de Reims, quand elle est dans les restaurants à Limoges à 80 dollars pour 550 km de reims.
La viande rouge est chère une petite côte de bœuf américaine à 32 dollars elle est pour demain midi.
Les ribs de porc à la sauce barbecue excellentes, compter 16 dollars pour 5 personnes.< /text>< Pics>

I'm not a fan of most fast-food places. But McDonald's is definitely one of my least favorite. The quality of the food is rough. Such as condiments missing my burger, cheese half of the patty. I wish the workers would put a little more effort in stacking the bread, pickles, patty, cheese and lettuce. At least completely on top of each other cause it created a mess in my car. In general I'll think again of coming back to a fast-food restaurant< /text>

Located inside the Walmart this McDonald’s is subject to Walmart’s hours of operation. No drive thru just a FYI. I frequent this McDonald’s and think the staff is extremely friendly and I have only ever received mostly decent customer service. They have gone through the associates who were on the more rude side and sure they may forget a sauce or a straw now and then but remember that they are human and food service is extremely stressful. Smaller establishment seating can be limited.< /text>

<text>There is an older woman named Katherine who works here and she is the rudest employee. She is so impatient, she gives a hard sigh when customers are counting their exact change, she rolls her eyes when a customer takes a minute to decide what they want including when a customer forgets to add something & when customers ask for a one time refill, she Iightly flares her arms up and looks irritated. This McDonald's is located in a Walmart and I shop at walmart a lot and tend to come in here to grab a drink and something Light so this isn't the first time i noticed she was doing it to many customers. If you're so unhappy katherine, quit your job! Just because you're having a bad day, you ain't gotta ruin everyone else's.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808f95cf3198315b:0xb5a1cd02549bbe4d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Basically the short of it is there are employees hear that basically just want to end their life it seems like because they are the absolute worst and make you basically depressed to be here as if it's not bad enough I'm eating McDonald's. And then anything you ever want is always out. I've been here on three separate occasions they've never had sweet iced tea they've never had chocolate chip cookies they've never had lemonade once or twice they've even been out of the Double Quarter Pounder yet he said he could get me two Quarter Pounders which then I was confused as to how they can't just make a Double Quarter Pounder.</Review>

Used to like McDonald's cuz it was real fast food and now with the freshness concerns they cook the burger until you order it, c'mon its still junk food and meat needs to be frozen or refrigerated anyway so waiting over 5 minutes for same junk food is absurd WE WANT OUR SAME JUNK FOOD FAST as it used to be right when you ordered and while you were paying  BOOOOOM was already there< /Review>

This McDonalds is located inside a Walmart store.  The seating is limited and the service seems to be slow.   Make sure you go here before shopping inside Walmart as you can't take your shopping cart inside the McD's.  Other than that... This is your basic, generic McD's.</text>

Very slow drive thru service, even at non-peak times. Older building,  not very well maintained. Bathroom are usually dirty. Transients are always hanging around inside and in the parking lot. Food is typical. Staff are usually friendly.< /Text>

<Text>I love McDonald's.  I admit it.  I love their iced frappuccinos.  The mocha kind.  When I'm doin' business in Union City (or elsewhere in the USA), I often have that afternoon nap feeling.

So to avoid taking the grandpa nap, I'll zip over to a McDonald's and try one of their tasty frap's.

Interestingly they have more caffeine than Starbucks. and I am really really wired therafter.

I think it's because of a) caffeine, b) sugar, and c) artificial flavorings.  Whatever it is, it's WHY I go to McDonald's, including this Union City locale.  As a locale, it's just average.  Perhaps below average - older and dirtier than most.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I just ordered online today for my 30 min lunch. I asked for brown rice and I got white rice, which I cant eat. Check your items before you leave the store. I had no time to go back and get my order fixed, disappointed.</review>

Owners are awesome people, go way out of the way to make your food perfect. The veggies are always fresh and the don't hold back to serve you well. They smile when you have special requests and attempt to be consistent every single time. Trust me I'm there 3-4 days out of the week.</Text>

<Review>I love Waba Grill, it's one of my favorites!!  I can eat healthy and it's tasty!  At this location, the tables don't move, so if you are on the bigger size, you can fit into some of the seating area< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Service not too friendly at all but the food was ok...just think in today's day you really should be nice and not short with your customers.

EDIT ***What else would I email you about? Your staff was unfriendly as if the customers that were there including myself were bothering him.***<//review>< pictures>

I used to go here a lot for lunch and then one day I was eating and a roach was crawling through the floor. I left immediately and never went back. The owner was there and did not seem to be a big deal for him so I am guessing he is used to it. No taking any chances.</Text>

Definitely giving oportun a 5 start. I’ve been given 6 loans with them. And definitely they are the ones to go to when I need extra cash. No to mention the girls who work there and super friendly and make the process so easy. Look for Martha and Cindy. They can help you out very professionals.</text>

I made a call to apply for a loan, I was preapproved and told to go into this store to complete the process. The application process in store was very easy and didn't take long at all. I was assisted promptly and professionally. I recommend this business.<//review>

< Review>
My wife always goes here and has been getting loans from this business since before we were even together, because the customer service is excellent. The location by Mt. Vernon is closer to where we live, but you just can’t beat the quality of service at this location. I went yesterday minutes after they had closed and the staff was so amazing and accommodating that they still managed to help me out. 5/5 stars would definitely recommend to everyone.<//Review>

<Review>A couple of my family members use the service. They haven't had issues with them as far as I know. I have co-signed for a family member once and it was okay. The process is a bit long the first time you go. Be prepared to wait at least an hour or so. Bring vaild ID, check stub and proof of residence (a bill). If you do use their services beware of the interest rate.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1578515253983, 'text': 'Our Customer Experience Team would like to look into this for you and help you further.

I love this place!When the doctor goes in to check on my kids he actually pays attention to my concerns. He never seems like he's in a rush to get out of the room and is very patient with us. Since he seen my baby when he was at the hospital the first time I liked him. He was very nice and professional.The staff is great and have great customer service. I've never had an issue with them. Thank you Dr.Dakak and staff!!< /Review>

< Review>
Dr. Alan Dakak is by far one of the best children's Dr. in town. Now, I have heard of some complaining of his staff and that his office isn't up-to-date. I must strongly say that Dr. Dakak far outshines any flaws that may come with along with staff and ambiance.
I have all three of my children with Dr. Dakak, and he is now happily my Grandson Doctor.
But, I would like to go back to a horrible trouble my youngest son was having with his stomach. It would hurt at random times for short to long periods causing him to miss school. The doctor ran every test from food allergies to bowl blockage, and still everything came out clear. Then one visit he looked at Eli and asked, "Are you have headraces while your stomach is hurting?" My son replied with a resounding "YES" to my surprise. The kind Dr. Dakak looked at me and said, "It's abdominal migraines." So, I'm happy to report my son is in back in school full time and loving life once again now that the doctor prescribed him the correct medicine.
Please understand that we are blessed with Dr. Dakak who has studied with some of the best in his filed! I would highly recommend Dr. Dakak; I would go through any hoop I would have to in order to have my children and grandchild to be to seen by him!
All the best,
Rebecca< /Review>

<Text>Dr. Dakak is always compassionate and open to listen to my concerns or any questions about my kids. I have a little one that gets sick every 3 weeks and he's worked with me to try and figure out why for so long.I will keep my kids with him until they become adults if possible :D ! Thank you Dr. Dakak and staff for always being so attentive and caring to my kids!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Dr. Dakak does an excellent job at really listening to details before diagnosis or conclusions. Humbleness and thoroughness makes wait time worth it as other reviews complained about. His time and dedication for follow up is unheard of as well.< /text><gmap_id>0x80ea69a28d981cbf:0xd4cc5865717f4775<//gmap_id></record>

Dr. Dakak is a wonderful doctor. My children have been seeing him since 2016. We have 5 children and adopting #6 our baby niece next month. I refuse to allow my children to see anyone but him. He is so caring and actually listens. He is funny and my 2 boys are 14 & 16 and absolutely will not even go to an appointment if they know Richard the nurse and Dr. Dakak both are not the one's to see them. My 14 year old son is very high strung and has behavioral issues due to past trauma with his biological father and Dr. Dakak never got mad at him. He has plenty of patience with him. Not to mention his bed side manner with his patience is amazing. Dr. Dakak works long hours and truly cares about his job. As a medical assistant myself and for someone entering medical school to become a doctor.  I have a lot of respect for him not only as a doctor but as an individual as well. I've referred many families to Kern Peadiatrics because of Dr. Dakak and Richard alone. As well as nurse Inez who may I add is amazing and the sweetest!!! She gave my 12 year old daughter shots 2x and my little cousin whom I'm in the process of adopting and she did great with both of them. My daughter said she is the only one allowed to give her shots anymore. Dr. Dakak also jumped in quick and tested my soon to be adopted son's blood work  just to make sure he was ok.  When we first got custody of him.. As we did not know all the trauma he had been through with his biological mother.  He also takes care of my 16 year old son who has marfin syndrome and anyone who has the opportunity to be able to have him as a doctor for thier child(ren) would be very lucky. Thank you to the staff at Kern Peadiatrics and especially Dr. Dakak, and the 2 nurses Richard and Inez. Thanks to Dr. Dakak for going above and beyond to squeeze my daughter into his im sure already very busy schedule.  Due to her potential PCOS. Thank you all and the Zepahua family is truly greatful for your care Kern Peadiatrics and Dr. Dakak.<//text>

I love this office. All these mothers need to quit acting like victims and realize medicine is not exact it evolves. Let me dummy that down for you. From one day to the next or even hours later an illness can get better or worse. Get over yourselves. I've never had a problem in the last 6 years. A little patience goes a long way. I bet they wouldn't have a problem waiting in line for 2 hours to get into a club though right?!< /Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>They take forever! Especially once in the room waiting for a doctor or PA. They can take all your time in exchange for 1 minute of theirs. Not thorough the last few visits, just was rushed in and out even though my son has been seen for the same thing before, this doc prescribed the same medicine that didn't work the first time...in fact it made him worse!! Went someone else for a second opinion and the doctor I saw couldn't believe Kern Peds prescribed my son what they did with his condition. Oh, one more thing, this office (throughout) is absolutley DISGUSTING! Someone needs to get to cleaning. Even seen as first set of patients in the AM, it is obvious the office was not clean the night before or maybe not at all that week. Couldn't even let my children walk around let alone sit on the chairs. Going elsewhere...<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>If it wasn't for Dr. Dakak we would've never found out that my son had a rare disorder. He is very gentle and caring. My son is autistic and has a hard time with noise and people. He has become very close with some of the staff here. I would never change my kid's doctor for the world.</review>< user_name>

I switched from Bakersfield Pediatrics to this lousy clinic. I had to switch due to changing insurances. Arrived at 3:05pm and it is now 4:30pm and we still have not been seen. The receptionist was rude. I could have been the same but I am not stepping down to their level. I will now have to switch doctors office again. This place is like another Clinica Sierra vista.</Text>

Dr. Dakak is very compassionate and caring when it comes to his staff and patients. He never hesitates to allow the parents to be evolved in all aspects of their child's care. I highly recommend him.<//Review>

I give it a star because they’re bad at their job. Took my daughter in too see the doctor, and they had me an hour waiting in the waiting room and then another hour waiting in the room to see the doctor. We never got to see the doctor so we ended up leaving and asked for our money back. Never going back to this place again.<//Review>

The wait is so long waited 3 hours for them to do absolutely nothing.... I wanted my kids to have a pediatrician who is hands on and sees them every visit not different doctors assistance every visit. They book so many people at the same time so it takes forever to be seen! The place is dirty too.</Review>

< Review>
My daughter was diagnosed with asthma and for over 2 weeks now I have been trying to get her medication bit dimas pharmacy lied about it not being covered by insurance so I asked them to transfer it to Walgreens but they refused so I asked the doctors office to send it but I had to call several times and it is still not sent. First the type was not for the correct age group, then they argued with me about it. They finally said they sent it yesterday but when I went to pick it up it was only the mask for the inhaler but not the inhaler itself. How does that even make sense?! I guess I have to call back and demand it again. Meanwhile my daughter is suffering.</Review>

Worst experience of my child’s life. I called scheduled her appointment still had to wait 3 1/2 hours to be seen and they wanted to give her 5 shots all at once I refused. I asked about a rash she was developing on her chest the fill in dr told me not to be concerned it was just heat rash. Later that night the rash spread to her face and back. I took her to the ER and the dr informed me she had scarlet fever. Never again will I endanger my child by going to this idiotic clinic. I’ve been on hold for over an hour and have yet to talk to anyone about who the fill in dr was that just brushed off my child’s illness as heat rash.</text>

Beyond incompetent, horrible bait and switch amd ended with my daughter in the ER. I met dr. Dakak At the hospital hours after giving birth to my daughter. He seemed nice, competent and knowledgeable so I decided to go with him. When I got there I was never once told HE wasn't the one I was seeing even though I specifically asked for him. I ended up waiting well over 2 hours in a room for some random lady to show up. She talked very quickly and with a very heavy accent. I wanted to walk out but my daughter had some troubling  symptoms (non stop screaming, hard to wake up when she was asleep, extremely dry lips and lethargic). She waves them off, said babies shed skin, tells me she wasn't listening cause I said chapped lips NOT dry skin, and shooed us off. She ended up in the ER the next day because I luckily chose to follow my instinct that something was wrong. She was admitted for severe dehydration cause by a severe tongue tie that kept her from feeding. If I had waited any longer or had believed this "medical professional" on it being dry skin my baby would be dead. Don't go here.</text>

Dr Dakak is a great doctor, does take about an hour and half or so to be seen but honestly you are going to wait like that every where you go. So everyone needs to learn patience.<//Review>

Yes, the wait times are long.
Yes, the office is usually full of screaming kids (bored from the long wait).

But Dr Dakak is worth the wait every time. My son was born with a rare genetic disorder and we spent two months at Dr Okezies office waiting for her to get him the help he needed. Her office has short wait times and she seemed okay but I would leave her office each time in tears because I felt like no progress was being made and like she didn’t really care what happened to my baby, he was just a number.
We switched to Dr Dakak and my sons first appointment he ordered labs and referred us to FOUR different specialist. He also got my son on medication that he had desperately needed since birth for his GERD and was able to find a hidden cleft palate that Dr Okezie missed.
Every visit he is SO genuine and I don’t feel like my son is just a number to him. Dr. Dakak takes responsibility for his patients care and leaves no stone unturned.
If you have healthy kids and just want to be in and out then this might not be the office for you, but if you want a doctor who is thorough and takes his time to make sure all your questions are answered, than you won’t find a better doctor in town.<//review>

<text>So firstly when I called to make the app for my child I waited on hold for 25 mins before actually speaking to someone.

Secondly we arrived 40 early for our app because I had to fill out paperwork. We still ended up waiting another half hour before we were taken to a room.

Thirdly, none of the staff seemed happy to be there. No one was smiling. It was not a very friendly environment at all.

Fourth, we didn't even get to see the doctor we made our appointment with!

Fifth, my son is very sensitive, and one would think that being a children's facility that sort of thing would be taken into consideration.... No.

The nurse basically had me pin him on the bed so he could get his needles. He was so upset he soiled himself a bit. Which by the way for a 4 year is very embarrassing.

Then the nurse practically ran out of the room saying "okay he's done you can go now. " didn't so much as walk us out!

I will NEVER bring my children here again or recommend it to anyone.< /text><user_id>103200948578879588510</user_id>< Rating>

Every visit for our newborn took at least 2 hours, even just a weight check. MA's did not foam in and out before or after touching my baby unless I asked! Dr. Dakas would get 4/5 stars but the practice as a whole I can only give 2 due to wait time.</review>< date>

I like Dr. Dakak but his staff is really rude. Particularly one "Nurse" . Our son came in for a set of vaccine shot but requested that if we can separate his shots due to a reaction with the first shots. Her response was "Here if you don't want the shots you have to sign here" and shoved a folder in my face. We said "No, we want the shots but not all at once" Again she said "if he get sick then I'm out (with both of her hands up) sign here (again shove folder in my face)." So unprofessional. You could just tell she just didn't care and wanted to get in and out. Not to mention the wait in there office is super long and even longer once they finally call you back and wait in the room. Will be looking for another pediatrician.< /text>

The doctor is good but I've had problems with other staff not very professional, always over staffed but has taken three hours for a simple immunization appt, completely rediculous for children to wait that long with signs on every wall saying no food no drinks and inside every patient room in the back has a huge trash can but your not allowed to leave a diaper you have to take them home with you!<//Text>

This is by far the worst Pediatrician ever! Very Unprofessional and the way he handles his patients not caring at all. This is supposed to be his new location bigger and better staff but all I can say is nothing has changed! If anything there staff have gotten worse! Theirs still a long wait even for "appointments" only. I get it you have alot of patients but if you can't handle the work and still be in a calm matter then why are you there!!? Your a pediatrician for a reason you attend your patiens and care for them. You just attend and then don't give a damn after and you treat the parents like there an idiot.<//Text>

The wrost place you can bring your child. The wait is long, the staff is rude. If you call they make u wait at least 20 mins and you might possibly be hung up on. The whole  experience  was just horrible. I don't not  recommend any parent take their child here the only good that dr. Dakak is a good doctor. To bad his staff isn't that good< /text>

<review>One of the most uncomfortable and scary experiences using this product. It’s so strong and potent. My body started to reject this potion. My eyes felt like it was irritated all night. I did a small patch test. I usually don’t have reactions but to this formula I did. I literally washed my hair at midnight because I couldn’t take the reaction I was having to this oil. I washed all my bed coverings and still had an ok sleep. Woke up feeling unusual. I know that’s a lot but it makes me realize how powerful things deep into your bloodstream when you apply it directly to your scalp. Unfortunately, they won’t return so that a $25 lesson for me.</review>< Pics>

I have not received a full refund for an order of holloywood hair bar products I placed on June 16, 2020; since I returned the box containing their leaking products earlier this month July 2020. Hollywood hair bar shipping was unprofessional. I had $102 on a prepaid green dot card when making this purchase on June 16, 2020. My purchase totaled $91. Hollywood Hair Bar took the entire $102 off of my green dot card, and I did not receive the leaking package until 3 weeks after the June 16, 2020 date. I was charged for shipping when Hollywood Hair Bar continues to advertise that any orders over $75 is free.</text>

<Text>Let me start by saying this. I normally don’t write reviews, but I needed to this time. I placed an order on 02/18/2021 for two of their products the moisturize me set and the large extra strength regrowth serum. I received my order today, but the serum was missing. I emailed them immediately of their mistake, and was told that I would have to get store credit and buy it again. I was fine with that as I am a patient person, but they wanted to refund me only a fraction of what I paid in the first place. I am upset that they just can’t send me what I ordered in the first place without all of this fuss. If they don’t refund me the correct amount or send me my correct product BBB, and my credit card company will be hearing from me. I was really hyped about trying their products, but they seem like they don’t want nor care about doing good business and retaining a customer base.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c2b90e544bb873:0xc135df1657d056fb</gmap_id>< username>

< review>
Very expensive products but it was worth a “self-care splurge” at first until I realized they’re just another company trying to scam you out of your money. I decided to do a $50 “self-care splurge” which ended up costing me $100. I noticed this company try’s to sell you the “check out extras” in a sneaky way. Well my luck, my screen froze and an additional product was added onto my basket. I couldn’t go back to cancel because it had gone through already. So literally 7 mins later I emailed customer service. They promptly responded telling me, “ Once we receive the order, it is immediately sent out for further processing to make sure that the package gets shipped within 24 hours. Due to which we do not accept any requests for amendments or cancellations.” This order took place Friday night at 830 pm. And within 20 minutes they were aware of the mishaps.
Their scammy marketing tactics to trick people into purchasing their extras, then locking you in permanently to make an extra buck is plain as day now. The worst part is I’m trying to support small businesses out here and at the end of the day, they will still mess you over. I’ll be purchasing my hair serum products from Hair Growth Co. This product works amazingly, smells wonderful, leaves your hair feeling fresh and IT’S Just $10 a bottle. They will get my money from now on!</review>

I ordered June 12 and just got my package July 8,2020. It was packed very well. I also attached picture for people who still thinks it’s scam. I will update on results in a month from today! Hope everyone gets their package also. I was so worried and was tracking it like a hawk and now I have it yay!<//text>

<review>I was skeptical about purchasing this product after reading the plethora of negative reviews. I have to say I’m so glad I didn’t listen to them. This product works! I contacted the owners via facebook, because all of the reviews I saw were by women. I love my queens, but I wanted to see how it would work on male hair. They assured me it would work so I went on and ordered. I saw the reviews where people said it took weeks and no contact. Cant say that’s true either. I ordered my product on a Tuesday and received it on a Friday. I wanted to wait until I saw results until I did a review. I will say, it took a little longer to see results (it’s been 3 weeks), but I did have patches where hair wasn’t growing at all and these are filling in. It’s honestly wild. I used to order Hims and honestly this is way better. My one complaint is that as my hair was getting used to it, it made my scalp a bit itchy. But that’s gone away. No use in giving this less than 5 stars. Will definitely be continuing my orders through this company as long as the products continue to work. Don’t always believe the negativity!< /review>< pictures>

I love this product. I have seen results in less than two weeks. If you order this product the only bad thing I can think of is it takes 3 to 4 weeks to get to you versus the 7 to 14 days they advertise. If you can get past that you'll love it. It's not Amazon and they do not have a Prime shipping so I've started buying the 4 and 8 oz bottle instead of the more expensive 1 oz bottle. Great product. Hopefully this helps someone😊</Review>

This review is rating the shipping process for this product as I received my order within 9 business days.  Statement from the company’s site.....(Please Allow 7-14 BUSINESS Days to Receive Your Order! Normally orders deliver within 5-7 business days but Depending on Demand some orders may be delayed a few more days than normal!) Now, I ordered this product online before reading the Google reviews that revealed some customers never received their shipment or received it weeks or months after ordering. After reading that I was worried that I could possibly not receive my order. Initially, tracking through UPS sent me a reasonable expected arrival date. I was like...ok cool. All good so far. Then after the expected date came and went I got worried because I had not received my order and could no longer track it via UPS. Then 5 days after placing my order I received an email from The Hollywood Hair Bar with a “shipping update” saying my order is on its way. I thought ok, it’s not lost. The distributor at least communicated to me.  So I just waited. Well I’m happy to say I did receive my order 7 days after receiving their email! 😊 I haven’t used the product yet, so stay tuned for my product update in a few weeks.</Review>

Placed order on 4/30 with this company and on 5/14(I wasn't worried as the expectations WERE 2.5 weeks, however, due to the pandemic,I was willing to wait a month. On 6/14 I received email addressed to someone else, that there was an incorrect address issue. I'd emailed and got generic responses that my order was on the way. I emailed to cancel orders and they said no because it is already on the way. Yes, I contacted the BBB and advised that I would be also contacting the FTC as well as the Attorney General regarding this business (which I advised I would be doing if no progress was made BEFORE doing so) Albeit, as they were either unable or unwilling to refund my money as they claimed it was already on the way to me, I went forward with contact. On 7/1/2020 I received a call from owner at 7:46 PM. The caller was very verbal in her anger for me having contacted the BBB.She proceeded to rant about why she felt that I was wrong to have done so. 'Black people are always trying to tear each other down' were her exact words and that she is 'sick and tired of it' and has decided to call each of us who has done this to her because she has had enough.I am disgusted! She would not allow me to get a point across so I'm here to tell her now and I am done.The problem with people like herself is that she keeps seeing color.This transaction had nothing to do with race, yes, while I was making a conscious decision to support an up and coming business that may have had reviews I was willing to trust and try on my hair, I'm not sure how my complaint to the BBB has anything to do with black people tearing each other down. Furthermore, I would like her to know that people tear themselves down by doing mediocre work and then expected people to constantly give them a pass. When I sent several emails expressing displeasure, (AS THIS WAS A PANDEMIC AND YOU COULDN'T DO ANYTHING-YOUR OWN WORDS NOT MINE), that was the prime opportunity to build your brand- email your customers and explain, don't assume- as you just told me this evening that 'EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON! She then had the audacity to say God bless you and have a nice day I'm tired of people acting like God's blessing is an insult or a curse. I want you to know that I am blessed, and when you are operating in God, you should operate in excellence. In the future, I hope that you get it right.When you knew that your fulfillment center was incapable of fulfilling your obligations you should've NOTIFIED YOUR CUSTOMERS THAT THERE WAS A DELAY!  And when someone gives you an opportunity to correct it, do so- not get mad when you don't then mad again when they follow the chain of command. I allowed this young lady to speak for several minutes however, when she was done, I proceeded to explain how she could've handled this better, was willing to ask that the product be reshipped and try to move on; nevertheless, she continuously cut me off speaking over me about how tired she was of this and that she didn't need to notify me because we all KNOW what is going on right now. She then said she doesn't want or need my money and she will refund it and I don't ever need to buy anything from them again. Well, with that customer service, or rather lack there of, I'd be afraid to purchase anything from this business anyway as I don't know what the vindictive owner would choose to do to the product she chose to send me. How sad an experience and a waste of time and money and such an unnecessarily rude phone call from someone who is running a business. Her personally calling me could have turned this entire experience around but she failed. I have no sympathy, I don't allow for excuses because I provide excellent customer service to all that I encounter and I demand it in return. If that is black people tearing down black people, well- please DO BETTER so that you don't have to feel that way.This is 1 review, you have an opportunity to fix it(not with me) but with your other patrons.I wish you well darling; when your back is against the wall, that is when your true character shows.<//Text>

<text>This is a scam ordered a bottle and it arrives in a dark blu bottle with a label covering it. The bottle was less than 1/2 full. I contacted them thinking it was an oversight and they asked for a picture of the bottle. They did nothing to correct the problem so I’m guessing the great reviews are all friends in an attempt to boost sales/theft. Don’t waste your money. It may work but how many 1/2 filled bottles will I need to buy before I know?<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I had hoped to write a raving review about this product, like so many others online. Although I'm starting to question their 5 star rating, I tried uploading my experience but it conveniently never made it to the site. It's impossible to review the extra strength serum, considering I never received the product that I purchased. I reached out to customer service about the mix up several times( I received the regular strength instead of the extra strength formula) but they saw fit to brush me off and are now ignoring me. I was not asking for a refund, just simply requesting that you replaced the item you sent with the one I actually purchased.  It's not easy to admit when you've made a mistake but it shows a great deal of integrity when you own it . Hollywood hair Bar I hope you do better in the future.</text>

I beg to differ with all of the negative & inpatient ppl I've received my order with no issues at all. I also individuals who never actually brought the products bet yet leaving bad reviews trying to tarnish this ladies business. Damn do you all have something better to do than to hate on someone.< /review>

Since May 14 I've sent several emails and photos to customer service because I received the wrong items and I still haven't received my correct order. Today the owner @style tiffanyrose sends me an email and text message calling me a liar and telling me that they don't do business with people like me. Heifer you scammed me and several other people and the Better Business Bureau website has a list of transactions who were scammed.< /text>

They are NOT scammers. I have ordered twice and even gotten a 50% discount on my second order.
It may take a while for you to get the item because I think they are overwhelmed with orders but you still get your order.
I gave a 4 star because it DOES take a while to receive the items and I think they need to figure that out.
The product works for me and I recommend it.<//review>

<Text>I saw so many reviews about people seeing hair growth within days, and call me impatient, but I saw NO difference in my hair after using for two weeks. Even used twice a day. Can't get a refund so I'm out $80 since I bought the shampoo too. Definitely not confident enough to buy another bottle. Super disappointed.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2b90e544bb873:0xc135df1657d056fb< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Hollywood Hair Bar has HORRIBLE customer service and does not take accountability. I understand that Covid-19 has negatively impacted orders from warehouse fulfillment to shipping speeds, but what I experienced was completely unacceptable.

i placed an order on 7/25/20. It shipped and I received tracking within 2 days. However, the order never reached me. The last tracking update occurred on 8/3. When I tried to call for assistance, the voicemail was full. The response to my email inquiry on 8/14 was to wait because it is still in transit. If it was in fact in transit, there would have been daily updates/scans. On 8/15, I requested a refund via PayPal and left numerous Facebook comments that were ultimately responded to via Facebook Messenger telling me that the item is clearly lost and instructing me to file an insurance claim.

Any business operating with integrity would have filed a claim, or at least researched the issue more than looking at the same tracking information I previously referenced, and issued a refund. Instead, they have been resistant and condescending. Additionally, the poor grammar, spelling errors and use of social media for communication lack professionalism.< /review>

I purchased this item a month ago and paid for the 3-day shipping. After 4weeks I contacted Hollywood hair bar by email, because they have no contact telephone number, and advised them for a refund at least on my 3 day and got denied. Apparently they do not do refunds at all everything is final, which is fine but I wish they wouldn't have advertised 3-day shipping and now I am wondering if I will ever get this product ever. This is false advertisement andfand information to the public.< /text>

<text>I ordered my products in May and they said it was delivered and according to USPS they addressed my package to wrong house. When I asked for a refund they did not answer. I spent 91 dollars on 2 bottes of oil and hair mask and all they have said is check with the post office. Horrible customer service and business. Will never buy from them again. I got scammed.<//text>< time>

<Review>I order this product june13,2020 and has yet to receive the product. Their contact number is only a recording and you can only email them. In which they take a couple of days before anyone gets back to you only to say you order is late due to the pandemic. I have ordered from other companies after the fact I ordered from HOLLYWOOD HAIR BAR and have received those packages. It is now July16,2020 and still no product. I requested a refund only to be told they don’t do refunds. I can’t speak for no one else experience but this is really looking like a scam more and more each day. So I have to go through some other measures to try and retrieve my money. I no longer want the product.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>To the people that gave low stars,I'm sorry for your experience. I received my order within in 5 days and I am about to reorder again. This product is like hair crack and Parton my French this is f***king that is the best expression I can give. I have not had edges ever in life Im forty years old growing edges in less then one week which is hella amazing. I read some reviews that said customer service was terrible in this case here let's forget about the service and focus on this amazing product we all have entered an establishment were cashiers, waitors or etc was not so polite but we still ate the food and bought the groceries right so how bout we uplift this black women for creating crack in a bottle for us women that could not grow it and had to sew it once upon a time now we can grow it and flow with it naturally.

One find it funny that all you see on their site is 5 star reviews. Two ordered 2 bottles only received 1. Three now they want me to jump through all these hoops just to prove something that was their mistake in the first place. PLEASE CHECK BBB FIRST!!! They're scamming a lot of people!<//text>

I ordered a 2 ounce bottle from them, they sent me the 1 ounce and refused to refund a portion of the money. They completely ignored my calls and emails for months. So no I don’t recommend this company to anyone. It’s really hard to support black businesses especially when you have to deal with rude, and unprofessional ppl like this.</text>

Terrible customer service, they will not work with me to amend my order and LIED about free shipping. I still wanted the product, I just wanted them to amend the order because I thought I was paying $60, not almost $100. The site didnt even confirm qty/price before it charged my account. I asked them to assist me and they refused. Not to mention, they stopped responding and it looks like they BLOCKED me on their Facebook page. All I wanted was to amend my order. TERRIBLE, DO NOT PURCHASE. I am reporting them to the BBB.< /Text>

I would have rated 0 stars if I could. Bad bad bad business. I received my order 5 weeks late, contents broken, no name on my package and wrong zip code. When I contacted them about it I was pretty much cussed out and told I wasn't getting my money back. Well, I got my money back from my bank who will in turn, take it from them. I then proceeded to report them to the AG as well as the BBB. They are a scam<//Text>

I placed an order from this company, and at the checkout after I put all my information in the website has pop ups for additional products they sold. Had to close about 5 pop ups to get to the last page only for their website to proceed to finalizing my order. I emailed the company the next day and they refused to cancel the order that I no longer wanted after dealing with their website. When asked if I can refused the only would I be refunded my money they didn’t answer the question. So once the items come I will be stock with products I do not want. Never trying company again as they don’t refunded customers money, do returns and aren’t willing the cancel orders before they ship. Very unhappy.</Review>

Very poor business practices. I received the incorrect product and dropper that is pictured to apply hair product was not provided. I reached out several times to the company via email, website, Facebook, and Instagram with no reply. Actually, I did get a reply on Facebook asking that I email the company which I did and still no reply. I paid $50 for the extra strength serum and received regular strength and no dropper.

Don’t waste your money. These people are seemingly out to scam consumers.</text>

Do not order from this company! I’ve been trying to get in contact with someone for a while now about a package I ordered back in February and still can’t get an answer. I don’t even give the company one star. The whole company is TRASH!</Review>

Products were purchased. The second shipment purchased came with the shampoo bottle top loose and most of it spilled out during transition.  When the company was contacted, pictures were sent as directed but no one will follow up or refund money. Will not purchase again.<//Text>

My car has a noise that comes up once in a while and they could not fix it nor hear it. I guess I will have to find another Toyota dealership to figure it out. They were mostly really nice over the phone and provided a good service but left my car in a mess . Could’ve at least washed it. Tiffany was sweet but not able to fully help me.</text>

<name>Anderson Fung<//name><Review>Went in to get a few things done. Was only supposed to be three days in the shop and cost around $1000. Ended up taking over a week to do the work and costing $5000. When I went in to pick up the car in the middle of the week the service advisor said they were just doing a “test drive” so I assumed they were almost done and I’d be able to pick up the vehicle that day. Four hours later me waiting at the dealership and it was not ready and they also ordered the wrong part for my fan resistor. They suggested I leave the vehicle overnight since they took apart the dash and it would take a long time to put it back together just to take it apart again. I told him I NEED my car because I was in the process of moving. When I finally got the car back done the mechanics left grease marks all over the car and the fan resistor in the car was not installed properly. I tried to get a hold of the manager by phone and email and never got a response. There’s a lot of other things that went wrong, but too much to list. Overall the service was overpriced and took longer than it should and didn’t do a good job of protecting the car. The labor I thought would be charged through a standard time it would take to fix certain parts, but instead they charged me based on how many hour they spent scratching their heads and just letting the car sit there while I pay for that as more labor cost.<//Review>< resp>

I arrived a little late for my service appointment.  I was warmly welcomed by Dave E., service advisor, when I arrived. He checked my car in and gave me a straight forward summary of the service I was receiving today.  He courteously asked if I wanted to have any car issues checked while I was there and did not try to upsell any service that the car did not need.  I appreciated Dave’s honesty in dealing with me and not trying to push service on me that the car did not need.  I waited in the service lounge and was contacted by phone once the service was completed.  Dave processed the closing paperwork and sent me on my way.  I appreciate his friendly and courteous customer service.  I had a pleasant experience today thanks to Dave.<//review>

I just bought my first car from Culver City Toyota and Karlen (an amazing guy!) helped me out. I went to at least 5 other dealerships before this one and always left extremely dejected and agitated. Karlen made my experience extremely pleasant, fair and honest from the very beginning.

I called in before I went in just to confirm that the car I wanted was available and that I would get the most competitive offer possible.

The finance department was great too - they explained everything in full detail to me as a first time car buyer. Overall, a very pleasant and happy experience!< /Text>

<Time>1619570800620<//Time><text>I had an appointment for a first time service for my car. Very easy stuff. Just a tire rotation, and vehicle inspection. Took them over two hours to complete. At one point I checked in with my rep to see how much longer it would take, and he said 10-15 minutes later, and just never got back to me. I had to find a different rep to help check me out. The original guy went on break for 45 minutes after he told me I’d be done 10-15. Very unprofessional. Will probably never use this service center again. The one in Santa Monica is much better.<//text></record>

Made an appt with Culver City Toyota and met with Edward.  Had to take my car in for a recall part.  Edward was very courteous and professional.  I received a text from them letting me know if I had any questions, to reach out and that they would notify me when my car was done.  CC Toyota is very easy and convenient to get to.  If you need work done on your Toyota,  I would recommend stopping by.< /Text>

Very satisfied with the service at Culver City Toyota I’ve been a HAMER Toyota customer for years many cars , and my first time at Culver City and it was just as I expected from a Toyota dealership. I went in to lease a car I was in and out within 3-4 hours very fast service very much impressed. All the representatives were great as well .</review>

<Review>I truly love having my vehicle serviced here. Whether I make an appointment a week in advance for routine maintenance or wake up in the morning and find that my tire is flat and need to schedule an appointment same day within 30 minutes, this place always goes above and beyond to take care of me. Thank you Emma and Dave for taking care of my flat tire in such a timely manner.</Review>< pics>

Typically, I avoid dealerships services because of the higher prices, but that shockingly wasn't the case.

All the service staff I encountered were helpful and polite from start to finish.
They identified and fixed my car's problem and charged just what was quoted, which was at a reasonable price; without giving me the run around or attempting to upsell services.

This place is very professional and made my car service experience pleasant. I definitely will be using them again in the future!<//Review>

At times, taking my car to get services can be tedious, not because of Culver City Toyota, it is just another task that I need to complete on a much needed day off.

My new friend Dave made servicing my car so easy. I have been in customer service for over 40 years and I enjoy a friendly, sincere and personable representative from any organization that I seek assistance. Dave is truly a breath of fresh air. As soon as he came to assist, he put a big smile on my face greeting me and checking in my car regular maintenance. Dave answered all of my questions. I felt secure that I wasn’t be ripped off regarding my car services.  Dave also wanted to make sure I had a ride home since I decided to leave my car for service.

To make a long story short, although I had been advised that Culver City Toyota maybe short of staff today, I would have never known it. My car was serviced, I was called prior to the projected four hours and as always, I was greeted with a friendly smile. If there is any incentive that you could provide my new friend, Dave, I would sure appreciate it! He, as well as all of the hard working employees at my Culver City Toyota, need to know how important they are to the customer. Thank you! Be safe and please thank Dave for me!

A Very Happy Culver City Toyota Customer 👍🏾< /text>

Loved the idea of pick up and delivery in these times being in a over 75 group. Made the apt for PU for 9 am. Driver came at 11 am. Understand they were backed up and only have so many drivers for pu BUT I would be better if they told you up front there is a 2 hour window. I would have made the pick up time earlier as I had timed a pu I had to make based on 9 am. Other than that service was great.</Text>

Robert and his crew made it extremely easy to purchase a vehicle here. They Uber me 30 miles into the city to test drive a car.
I was in and out of there in less than two hours. They are selling me such a reliable car I doubt that I’ll be back there soon. But if I were to ever purchase another Toyota hands-down I’d go back to Culver City< /text>

Made an appointment for 6pm. I showed up 10 minutes early and received no help for about 10 minutes. I had to call twice to finally have someone come out to assist me and when they did I was treated as an annoyance. Very unsatisfactory. Didn’t feel appreciated as an customer.<//Text>

But this person (Enrique) have a very Bad attitude when I go to a dealer I go and try negotiate everything including car prices. Cause that’s how it is. It’s all about best deals everywhere. But he start Yelling he’s Point of view and careless about our options. We want more buying option. But he have no patience at all. Me and my sister are very disappointed. In the other hand Marcy and the very first person who show us and give us the test drive are excellent sealers no complaints.

Just got my Lexus and could not be happier with the car and experience. Very easy and smooth transaction. Carlos and Kaalan are the best. If you don’t like to waste your time and want good car for the best price this is the place  to go. Definitely one of the best dealers in LA.</review>

I’ve brought my 2014 Prius exclusively to Culver City Toyota for service since I purchased it.  They have an organized service center which has made maintenance visits a breeze.  Right away in the very beginning I was super pleased.  They have a large and comfortable lounge area should you choose to wait or they provide complimentary drop off and pickup from your home to help you out.  They me reminders in the mail and texts on the service dates to keep me informed when my car is finished.  I’ve replaced tires when they advised me to and just had my 50k checkup.  They will frequently discount their services.  All together: they’ve made owning my car and keeping it in great condition absolutely painless.  I really appreciate iatse their support!</Review>

<review>Charles who helped us was kind to my son, I appreciated that. We were never planning on coming back to this Toyota because of issues with their service last time and lacking customer service, but when we used a new place they told us that something was leaking from our old service so we had to go back. When I called the customer service was awful when we arrived nobody really seem to care that we had terrible service before, supposedly they looked at the leak , we got an oil change and there was nothing done to our car, no clean windows, no vacuumed floors, no windshield wiper fluid refill. I’m not even sure if they even did an oil change. The customer service here is no bueno. A year or two ago when we were coming here more consistently there was a guy named Ed and he was super nice & helpful. But ever since then it’s been downhill.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Time>1603757280075<//Time><rating>5</rating><text>Although I had great customer service experiences the last two times at Toyota of Hollywood, nothing beats the personnel working at the Toyota of Culver City. The employees make the experience personal, not only caring about your vehicles’ lifespan but prioritizing the drivers. Taking time to step into the shoes of the customer, they’ve helped me out with warranty, promotional deals, and a quick turn around regarding vehicle inspections/ maintenance. While I only live less than 5 miles from Toyota of Hollywood, there is a good enough reason based on my past experiences to drive a bit farther to get the customer care I don’t find anywhere else.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>We saw a used car advertised on the dealer's website, called ahead to verify if the car was physically on the lot and made an appointment. We were introduced to a different salesman than who we were told to look for but we were fine with that. The friendly, but very green, salesman pulled the car up for us to inspect.

Everything is great and we want the car. We go inside to discuss purchase. Naturally, we try to haggle a little but were fully prepared to pay the sale price as advertised on their website.

This is where the dealership failed. They practice in deceptive advertising. In the fine print on their website for the car we are purchasing it states that "Prices do not include dealer fees, state and local taxes + TT&L. Doc fee =$85 and tire fee =$8.75."

Now that were talking numbers they add almost $2000 to the sale price because they installed a GPS security device and some paint and fabric protector.  I know this tactic isnt new, Ive purchased several vehicles over the years. But the additional items the dealer adds are usually included in the price. I rejected the items and tell one of the sales managers, Jose, that we want the car as advertised. He cant sell me the car as advertised. THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT HONOR THEIR ADVERTISED PRICE. I read the manager the fine print, to show him the deceptive practice and he said he is aware that customers "see it like that."

We ultimately purchased the car but plan on filing a complaint with the FTC for their deceptive practice. 2 stars instead of 0 because the salesman and the finance guy were good guys.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>While the individual who showed me the rav4 was fantastic, management added $5,000 to the MSRP during price negotiations because the car was “in demand.” Not sure when car dealerships adopted the surge pricing model and started needlessly upping sticker prices after sitting customers down. Incredible. Needless to say, won’t be shopping here.< /review>< Pics>

We came to Toyota Culver city  for a scheduled service. Edward told us that it supposed to take about 2hrs.  After more then 3 hours waiting we asked Carles S. and find out that our car was ready and he send us to the front for pick up. At the front we were waiting for another 20 minutes to find out that WE are suppose to inform a person there that we are waiting.  We felt neglected by Edward and Charles S. It seems like Toyota Culver city is still practicing an old, “we do not really care for your business” approach. Very sad. Do not want to come again.<//review>

I must give credit to the management as well.

Hi Mr Keoroghlian,

Thank you for reaching out.

I asked the person servicing us (who was kind and responsive) for alternative times/dates to reduce the possible wait. He said the wait is always the same. It unfortunately did not seem like a single day issue, but an administrative issue. Is it possible to give customers with appointments priority or reduce the number of appointments?<//Text><Response>{'time': 1609367299373, 'text': 'Hello Zach Chandy,\n\nI am sorry that our service was slow that day.

<Review>John was amazing! His communication about the repairs needed for my Toyota Camry was very helpful. He was available via text and phone call, and if I needed to leave a message, he called me right back. I was very appreciative of the customer service I received.</Review>< date>

It was my first time buying a car so I didn’t know what to expect but I feel taken advantage of, they said the contract is signed and nothing can be changed.

Great experience, our sales agent was very informative and expressed every detail about the vehicle purchase. Like everything during the Coronavirus it takes a little more time, but it was worth it. Excellent service! And to rap everything up, Sebastian brought it home! He's a great access to the Toyota family. These two young men are very special I give them 10 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟, and 2 👍 up. Great team!!!</text>

My hybrid requires synthetic oil, which always cost more no matter where I go. Their employees were efficient, quick, and abided all covid protocols.  I didn't have to worry about shoddy service or someone poking around in my vehicle without a mask.  The professionalism and efficiency definitely made me into a return customer.</Text>< pictures>

I have always been told not to do service or buy at a car dealership due to the costly repairs. Culver City Toyota is different. The prices on parts and oil changes are reasonable, but what is best is the awesome service! Thank you, Culver City Toyota! You have a loyal customer!<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I had a great experience here, did most of my negotiating online with Miguel Cervantes.

Location: The location is a little cramped. The parking  lot does have free vallet which is great. Saved me alot of time. My only problem is that the streets are a little confusing and without gps it’s hard to find.

Sales rep: Miguel Cervantes was a great sales rep. He kept touching base with me online, was very polite and honest with me during the negotiating process. After finalized everything he did everything he could to make my waiting extremely comfortable offering me water keeping me constantly updated and even sat with me just for a casual chat. All these big and little things he did made my overall experience great. I had to wait a long time around 4 hours just to finalize everything. I got pretty annoyed and impatient honestly. But Miguel maintained a professional attitude and was very patient and understanding! So good on ya man! You killed it.

Financial rep: The long wait was due to being short staffed which is understandable since it’s during a pandemic. Christian did a great job explaining the ins and outs of the contract and answered all of my questions. He too was also very patient with me when I was irritated. He did a great job getting me through all of the paperwork and getting things finalized. He even tried to see if I can get good financing too! And if it helps, we had a good time chatting about things.

Overall experience: I had a great experience minus the waiting but it couldn’t be helped like I said it was very busy and they were short staffed. Miguel and Christian did a great job helping me get everything squared away.

Expectation: Just to give you an idea of expectation, Saturday is their most busy day if you can do your business during the week if possible unless you don’t mind waiting. Keep in mind the pandemic, as it plays an effect on how much staff there is. The staff is working hard despite the odds. I feel like taking all these things into account before your visit would help alleviate some stress.< /review>< Pictures>

The service was good today. The complimentary option to have your car picked up and dropped off to your residence or preferred place is nice. The pick-up was delayed but apparently they need a 3-hour window for pick-up of vehicle from your place. It would be better if they told us this beforehand when we book online. My appointment was at 10:30am and they didn’t pick up my car until 12pm. But the service was finished by 3pm and the car was delivered to me by 4:45pm. That’s a decent time. I had a bad experience in service with them last year. But this one was good. Easy communication this time with advisor, Raul. But my car also just needed regular maintenance. No repair or replacement of parts or any other problem. Raul, Oscar and Arturo were all very nice. Overall, pretty good this time around.<//Review>

< Review>
I dropped my car off with you folks around 9:45 AM. Roughly an hour and a half after I dropped my car off you sent me this link for this survey. I had been told by my service person that I would get a phone call when my car was ready. Seven hours later I called to check the status of my car and was apologetically told that I should’ve got a text. A text is not a phone call and no such text arrived. I had been waiting for you folks to do a computer update for the recall on my car so that I can get the tags. To make matters even worse after that and even explaining to my service person my negative experience the first time I had come into your shop (This is rhe 2nd) he didn’t fill out the paperwork I needed for the DMV and I had to come back in and ask for it. This is a great way to alienate your customer and make them not want to come to your shop. The first time I had come in it had been when I first got my Prius and I’m an Uber driver and both myself and my customers felt warm in my car even if it had been ice cold overnight and sitting in the shade. I paid $170 and a mechanic just shrugged his shoulders and said he couldn’t find anything despite the fact that me and countless passengers had found it overly warm in the car requiring an open window or AC to be turned on. You’re incredibly close to where I live but I’m not gonna go for three for being just treated like I’ve never been treated as a customer. Very disappointing.<//Review>

<Text>My tire makes a grinding sound so I took it in, after 5 hours waiting they tell me they’re all done- they couldn’t fix the issue because they couldn’t replicate the sound I told them about. I went home and had my boyfriend record a video of the tire grinding and the sound it makes. I went back and showed them. After 4 more hours they said it was because of the tires that I had put on.... I bought the truck as it was one month prior. Then he told me to take it back to the dealer I bought it from.... three hours away. Terrible service, they don’t listen and they waste your time.</Text>< Rating>

I’ve been using the free service that came with my car purchase. I coulda sworn that the service should have been free…. But it cost over 90 bucks for an oil change…. The most irritating things is the constant upswell…. You should clean your fuel injectors…. And cabin filters…. That sort of thing. I’ll probably be going elsewhere from now on.</Text>

<Review>My headlights were not working properly and I explained that I had purchased the same ones a week prior at AutoZone and had them installed by a private mechanic. The lights were on but not illuminating. The technician said the quality of voltage was poor for the ones I purchased. I was quoted by Culver City Toyota $156 for parts/labor to replace both headlights. So I purchased the headlights from Toyota Parts department and checked the voltage against the ones I purchased the prior week. Same voltage 12V and 55 Watts. So I’m confused about the poor quality when they were exactly the same. Culver City Service department you have to do better with telling your customers the truth....not a satisfied customer.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1613147326215, 'text': 'Hello Muslimah Muhammad,\n\nThank you for the review.

I took my car in because the check engine light was on been taking it back to Toyota since November of 2020 took it back left it there for a week check engine light came on a day later . Took it back left and drove 20 miles  came on again and I took it back they're telling me it's something else and they're charging me more money I feel that I've been ripped off I feel that they did not repair what was wrong with the car and every time I drive off a day later the check engine light comes on.  They say it was something else. The problem is I brought it to them for the same thing they didn't fix and now I have to pay more money to get my car out.< /text>

After a shaky start with their Sales manager TJ, my wife and I left the dealership very upset and disappointed.  I emailed upper management the next day to let them know about my experience.  I was not expecting a response from the dealership but to my surprise, George Boktor, Assistant GM called me a few hours later.

George attentively listened to me without interrupting and he apologized for my disappointing experience. George understood that they failed me as a potential customer and was willing to do whatever it took to mend the relationship. I'm happy to say that by the end of our conversation and after a few follow up texts, George was able to get me the truck of my dreams.

GM's and Assistant GM's are very busy individuals. George took the time out of his busy schedule to return my calls and emails and that showed me how committed George was to ensure that my experience with Culver City Toyota ended on a happy note.

George, you are a true champion of customer service and damage control.  You are an asset to your company.   Thank you!</text>

Came to check out the 2020 supra they had (used with 7k miles already) that I recently saw online. The deal looks great and I went to check it out, when I arrived none of the salesmen approached me, all of them giving us looks for no reason. We had to approach THEM to ask for the car, And they were annoyed and seemed bothered because we weren’t some old 40 year olds to purchase the car. (Didn’t know you needed to meet a certain age to purchase a car). One salesman asked us what we wanted we asked him to see the supra as we go to see the car he stated that we couldn’t see the car as it was very rare and he couldn’t bring us the keys unless we had proof of income (JUST to see the car we needed proof of income.)I was stuck between getting an m2 or a supra and now I’ll make sure to never get a Toyota again. Very disappointed at the management at Toyota of Culver City and I’ll make sure to never buy a car from them again.</Review>

The purchase of my new Toyota truck has been a hassle-free, convenient and downright enjoyable experience.  The sales staff worked tirelessly to create a purchase agreement that works perfectly with my retired status.   Knowledge and personal attention sets them apart from all other dealerships.  Full marks, sterling job,  well done Culver City Toyota, Bravo!<//Review>

Took my Toyota Scion TC to this Toyota dealer on the referral of my sister and was NOT disappointed.  Mark Iraheta who is THE BEST!!!  I told him my budget (especially in the COVID-19 climate) and he did everything to make sure that I was taken care of. I got the service that I needed and will just wait for the other stuff that’s not as important until another time. So whenever you need a repair representative, ask for Mark!  He’s professional, polished and knowledgeable!! 😀😀  I will be back!< /review>

< review>
I go in on a Tuesday morning for a simple oil change (after making an appointment) and still waited almost 4 hours after being told I’d have a 1 1/2-2 hour wait. I had to call at least 5 times to be informed that the car was ready. Apparently the service advisor “called the wrong number.” After missing another engagement because of their lack of punctuality, I get home only to see the cap was left off my tire. Terrible and frustrating experience. Go elsewhere !</review>

<Text>Service was excellent.
Unfortunately, the service phone wasn't answered and 'they' didn't call me back.  So I drove in without an appointment.
Unfortunately, I pulled in the slower  of the two service lanes and a lot of cars got in before I did.  Next time, I'll get in the empty lane.
Otherwise a good, friendly, competent experience.  I'm sure my Toyota Tacoma like getting her oil changed.
I highly recommend it.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Early morning Drive up, Culver City Toyota Service Department, Customer Service was Perfect. On Point! Was greeted by Ozzy 🙏🏼 Nice and Courteous. Made a it a smooth transaction especially for my hectic morning. Ozzy Communicated well, answered all my questions And kept me updated throughout the day regarding my truck. Also, The dealer provided a pick up Uber ride for me (Niiice! So Convenient Too!) Five Star All The Way! Upon receiving my Baby aka Truck... Just wished it was Ozzy that handed over my keys when all was done 😋
Anyhow, Thank you Toyota, Thank you Ozzy, for a Wonderful Experience especially even during this Time of this 2020 Pandemic 😷 ✌🏼

< Review>
I used to come here a decade ago and they bait and switched me once. I told myself never again I would go here! Upon doing some research through find a really good price on a Prius Prime 2021 through true car. They were the cheapest dealer in the state of California by $400. The next dealer was $1,400 more. I could not be happier with my purchase. Might I add that the dealer has changed hands and is now a Ken Graff which is what intrigued me to go there. Had a feeling it was going to happen again. My wife was worried! IT DIDNT HAPPEN!! WHAT A GREAT EXPERIENCE! From the lady that help me in the internet department that was forwarded my information by TrueCar, to Mr. Cervantes and and super smooth honest dealership. I have bought alot of Toyotas and this one takes the cookie. Easiest ever transaction! BEST TRANSACTION I EVER HAD BAR NONE!!!! THANKS GUYS! AMAZING!!</Review>

They are trying to take in the same amount of business while they are only at half the staff. I spoke with someone there when he explained that the reason I waited 5 hours was because they are understaffed.  I suggested to not take so many appointments to which he replied "we are running a business." When I said that isn't fair to his employees, he just kinda shrugged. My issue could have waited until another time. If someone on the phone had just told me "hey we are a bit understaffed and there are long waits." that would have been fine. Toyota- ease up on your appointments. Take care of your staff.<//Review>

This dealership ruined how much much I thought I loved Toyota.
Your Toyota Warranty’s mean nothing,
And Toyota leaves it up to the dealerships opinion on if it’s “your fault”

<Text>I made my appointment at 7am and when I got there I waited 5 minutes and out of nowhere I see a group of service rep walk out of an office and right away start tackling cars. They set me up in 2 minutes and took over my vehicle after that. 3 hours later I get a text that my vehicle was ready. They are quick and efficient.

Purchase the car from them 7 months ago still haven't received a license plate. Been calling for the last 3 months and getting the running around from the DMV department of Culver City Toyota with no follow-up. Look at purchasing from a better dealership that offers better service. This dealership does not care about their customers.< /text>

< Review>
I'm so sad this time.Yesterday I reached Culver City Toyota and wanted to have service.They said now long line and I have to wait 2-3hours.I said I can't wait so long and want make appointment for tomorrow without waiting. They gave me appointment and when I reached on time they said it's take 3-4hours!Why??Why I need to loose two days for car service. I asked manager Ozzy Perez to help me don't wait so long time but ha said that's impossible, this is rules and technical issues to wait 3-4 hours today. I was so sad and said OK and I'll be wait dut will write the review about. Service has been done through 1,5 hours but I was sad already and finely</Review>

<text>Visited the service department on my Prius for a mandatory safety recall. Had an appointment for a service that was quoted as :45 max, but because the department was running behind,  it took 2.5 hours. Waiting area was clean, safe and well maintained. Free Wi-Fi and charging stations available for cell phones (nice), but no cables for Type-C (Android) phones... bummer. Service manager MIA for 2 hours while I attempted to get an update on the status of my vehicle.

One plus, they did a safety check of my vehicle and found an issue with my suspension that was covered under my extended warranty- a $1,000 between parts and labor - and made the repair during this visit. So, that was nice!

In all, I think Toyota dealership service departments tend to be more expensive and everything is highly marked-up. So, for safety recalls, etc., I will return. But, I will support small business with basic service interval work.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1600901308225, 'text': 'Hi Daniel - Thank you for the review and also for visiting our store to service your vehicle.

I have always had a really good experience with Toyota. They have a new service since COVID/the pandemic started where they will pick up your vehicle and drop it off. It’s so convenient and I don’t have to do anything besides be home to receive my vehicle which is perfect for working from home.

The staff is so friendly and helpful here. They really do go out of their way to be accommodating and kind.

I definitely trust Culver City Toyota for all my Toyota needs!< /Review>

They are nice and friendly but this location definitely requests more unnecessary repairs more than any other Toyota service center I have been to. In this past year alone I have spent $2000 on what should have been routine check ups, replace fluid here, clean out filters there. I would say shop around because I don’t think these pre-emptive repairs are truly necessary.< /Text>

My service was quick. I really appreciate the format of the extensive checks they do on my car with the oil change. Very easy to read and I appreciate the visuals. I so appreciated Ozzy’s call to tell me my car was done as I was about to walk home but luckily when he called I was very close so I could pick it up right away.

<Review>I would like to thank Elena for her great customer service and transparency! I traded in my older car for a newer one and the whole process was easier than I expected. Elena showed me a few cars I was interested in and allowed me to take them for a test drive. After selecting the vehicle I wanted, Elena did the best she could to acknowledge my requests. They gave me a great deal and I walked away with a new vehicle. Overall, the communication was effective and the sales team was very friendly!<//Review>< pics>

I have continued to have both vehicles serviced here because of the integrity and sound advice I receive from my advisor, Randy. Randy has not always been my rep here, but he is my preferred. Moreover, I have interfaced with other professionals of various levels in the service and parts dept. and my experience has always been a favorable one.<//Text>

I couldn’t even remember since when, but at least for 5+ years. 2012 Camry hybrid is in good working condition, and it has over 205k mileage as I drive 2x-3x than average drivers, yet it’s still run like new condition partly due to Randy has been very helpful for me.

Was helped by Carlos right when we parked and got out of the car. Appreciate the quickness and efficiency, he was also very helpful and easy to talk to. The only problem I had was how long it took to actually get the car and go when the papers were all signed and finalized. Other than that, it was a pretty smooth experience. Thanks guys.< /Review>

I would have given a 5 but one of the sales rep came rushing into the office yelling while Jesus was helping us. Very disrespectful but Manuel and Jesus were great!!< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>I went there for an oil change.
I had an appointment at 10:30 and Luis was with whom I have the appointment, I asked how long it will take and he told me 2 hours and the 2 hours passed and I was looking for Luis to ask him about the status of my car but I never saw him.
It took 3 hours to receive my car and I asked like 3 times and somebody whom I forgot to asked his name, told me that they were working on a recall that my car had and Luis didn’t inform me that that was also going to take place but in the paper that they gave me it said that I requested that recall repair. I had a very horrible experience there. They did whatever they wanted and they didn’t care about the customer.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Was in the market for new car and decided to try the Costco Auto program. Was referred to Culver City Toyota, found the car I wanted along with the color, low inventory and few colors not ready available at other dealership.

Was able make a incredible deal along with a trade in value on my other car which I was unable to get in early 2019.

The Internet Director was so professional and even called me when Toyota sweeten the deal with extra cash. The sales person very helpful before and after the sale.

Very happy with my new Camry.

Thank u,

<Review>AMAZING SERVICE! Scheduled a maintenance appointment for my Camry the day before and I received texts/emails to confirm (which I love). The next day I got a call from Dave in the service dept before they arrived early in the morning to pick up my car. Drivers were nice/wore masks. Overall very smooth and great communication. Awesome that they are doing the pick up/drop off service right now.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Made a diagnostic appointment at Toyota when I spoke to the agent over the phone she told me that it would be $165 so I made an appointment and took my car there. When I arrived the person at the counter told me that it would be 300+ since it was an electrical check. Mind you I informed the agent about this over the phone as she specifically asked me what was happening with the vehicle. I really felt that they could have been honest with me. As a Toyota owner that always brings my vehicles to Toyota and has bought 3 brand new vehicles from them I am more and more disappointment with this brand every day and now with my dealership experience. No one cares for you as a customer it seems like all they see when they see you is dollar signs.</review>

I visit Toyota service department in Culver City on July 7th. I was greeted by David who work in the service department. David was very thorough with explaining the services while reviewing my account he has a very good sense of humor to be working in customer service he made me smile the whole time. He also made sure I knew all communication contact while getting my car serviced and advise me that I will have text messages and email updates. He advised me of the approximate time frame that it would take for my car to be serviced and for me to return back to the customer waiting are while practicing social distance he also explain my care coverage.</Review>

<Text>I had been a costumer at this dealer.  With two of my cars . Yesterday i towed my prius c   For a estimate. The estimate was so high i could not fix it there. Today i went back to dealer to tow my car and they charged me for the estimate and return my car not only with exhausted battery (it was working when sent with tow truck). Parts they took out were thrown in the back seat , cracked  right side mirror frame . The estimate said  i have to change fuel pump and battery  v12.   This morning i called AAA for gas (even though it marked it had two lines) and a jump   The car worked like nothing was wrong. Yes i tested battery and it needed to be changed $ 200 plus $ 20 to install it and $8 in gas plus toyota inflated estimate $169 against $1856, They  were charging me to fix it. Do the math.  Pretty scary to trust toyota dealers. I am thankful for honest mechanics elsewhere. Toyota culver  city is a never again for me.   Also not sure if it is a coincidence but my front driver window automatic open and closed does not  work anymore since i pick it up from dealer. Not sure where i can report them also i would like my money back. Name of person that help me was Raul Ruiz. The sad part is that i asked if there was a temporary fix  they said it is not going to work if you don't change the fuel pump.  Support small local business. These big companies are ignorant of mechanics and greedy . Sometimes not having money open your eyes to the world we live in  and makes you use your brain and informed yourself.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I had a wonderful experience today! Tiffany is great at her job and gives great customer service! Coming from the Ritz-Carlton my expectations are rarely exceeded anywhere else. Today, Tiffany with her knowledge and friendliness did just that. I was in such a good mood I bought 2 items while waiting for my car! The gentleman who serviced me also went and got a change holder/ashtray that I saw on the website when I bought my car. I didn’t purchase it as it was more ashtray than coin holder....but he was great as well. I bought the trash bag and 2 compartment organizer. Thank you!</text></record>

<Name>Basil Abusrur<//Name><date>1609541062108< /date><Rating>1</Rating><text>I completed the Kelley Blue Book instant cash offer on my car, and Culver City Toyota was one of the dealerships offered me a deal considerably under an offer I had already received. Then I received a call or email from Elena Kix stating that the offer I received online will be beat by them 99.9% of the time. The offer was around $5k less than I received elsewhere. I stated this to Elena and she still told me to come in. Well I get there and the place is super crowded inside during a pandemic. She's with customers at that time. I walk around to try and find someone to help me. Finally find someone to help me. Basically I waited over an hour for them to tell me they will offer me $300 more than the online offer on my car. What a waste of time.

Now Elena will probably be commended by her GM that she did everything correct in getting me into the store. This is to warn other consumers who try to sell their car to Culver City toyota that most of the time it will be a waste of time, and they won't be beating the online resellers like Carvana who are much safer to use during a pandemic.</text>< Pics>

Ask for Obi!   Great sincere sales person who will make sure you get the best deal.   He’s not your typical car sales man. He made me feel like he had my best interest at heart.   And wasn’t afraid to keep trying to get a better  deal for me< /Review>

Using the Toyota chat online was really simple. The representative was friendly and quickly responded to my request and questions. When I arrived to my appointment I was met immediately by a friendly service rep. I’ve been to this service department before and knew what to expect. The neighborhood is nice to walk around with lots of eateries available.</text>

< review>
The dealer ask me to review them but all I did was drop the car off for a complete diag of the car. So I’ll update this when I get the news from the diag report.
I just bought the car from a Toyota dealer in Alhambra. I would not recommend buying a used car from them. I test drove the car on Friday and every thing was working. I was pretty thorough and tested all the mechanics, warm start acceleration and panic stop. Checked the air and heat. Checked all off the dash and doors and trunk. Noticed the damage in the rear carpet and the scratches on passenger dash, the review mirror was not installed correctly and there minor scratched on the exterior paint. I bought the car and the next day the ac didn’t blow cold air.
So today, Monday, I brought the car to the Culver City Toyota dealer to diagnose the ac issue and do a complete inspection of the car as I want to know everything that was wrong with it.
I called the Alhambra dealer on Saturday, the day after I bought it, regarding the failed ac system, and they said tough luck you bought it as is.<//review>

<time>1611450200266</time><review>The initial "courtship" and follow-through to the point of sale was good. I got the vehicle (RAV4 Hybrid) I wanted at a fair price. Then I had to sit around for over an hour waiting for the "finance guy" to wade through his backlog of customers. When I left the dealership I went to activate the Navigation system and it was not functioning. When I got home I hunted around online and found out how to activate Toyota's navigation app. Unfortunately, the intermediary link would not let me complete the task. I e-mailed my sales rep and told him my tale of woe. He asked me to come by the dealership and he'd take care of it. He allowed as how "Wayz." for example, was better than the factory system and we hooked it up via my cell phone and the USB port. I have loaded hundreds of songs onto a USB drive and prefer to listen to my own music while driving. Alas, it appears that I can't do both. So I really want the Toyota nav system operational. I have now e-mailed the salesman twice and not had the courtesy of a response in a week. Needless to say, I am not a "happy customer." The owner's manual is 752 pages and leaves much to be desired. I would recommend that any new purchase include a detailed session with a qualified technician to review all of the vehicles intricacies and make sure everything is operating properly. Lots of nice features...to bad accessing them is not overly intuitive.</review>< Pics>

Please don’t go to this dealership. They do not take responsibility for their mistakes. I was suppose to receive a specific vehicle. After waiting 5 hours in the dealership, I did not receive what I wanted. I did not see the mistake until the next morning and Miguel nor the supervisor took responsibility for omitting the correct description of the vehicle. Please go somewhere else. Don’t trust these people, they are rude and treat you like they made you a huge favor and you should be happy with what you got. I shared with the supervisors that I have adhd and I have difficulty doing two things at the same time. He said that I had nothing to complain since autism is worse. Both the sales person and the manager/supervisor were condescending, “thank you for accepting that you didn’t see” while they took no responsibility for making me believe that I would get the car that I wanted.<//Review>

I drove in because my tire was really low. I was unsure where to go so I parked in the service valet. I walked into an empty office. The guy said go to the parts dept. I did...no one was there so I walked up to a guy eating at his service  desk. He walked me over to someone who said wait on the bench. I did. Shortly after  someone said your car is ready. I asked if they had found a nail etc. He said, no. You are good to go. The tire was almost flat so I am dubious...as an update,. The next morning my tire was flat. We were able to inflate it enough to get to America's Tire. There they found a large bolt They repaired the tire. What bothers me is that the service dept was very slow at Toyota.....<//text>

<Review>I purchased a car on December 9th this year, the value of the car is $22,000ish and I traded in a Honda Civic with a Trade on value of $6,500, which Toyota Financial agree to pay, I did not received a copy of the documents I signed because we need it my husband’s signature because the Honda was under his name, my husband signed the documents the same week, Toyota overnight the paperwork for him to sign and he did. For the past week I been calling and leaving messages and nobody returns my calls, I need clarification and a copy of the documents I signed because I received the statement from Capital One (who financed my car loan) my loan with them is for $26,000 for a car that is valued @ $22,000 obviously the numbers don’t add up, what happened with the $6,500 from the car I trade in, at the end I am paying $32,000 for a $22,000 car. I finally spoke with David Cruz yesterday a sales professional, he helped me get my car, I explained the situation he said he will get back to me in 20 mins I haven’t heard from him since then, now when I call his number it goes straight to voicemail. My advised to people searching for new cars do not go to this place you will regret it!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>This review is for used car sales. I don't normally take time to leave reviews, but Culver City Toyota wasted 5 hours of my time, my mothers time, and my fathers time.

I find a rare 2017 Manual Corolla for sale at Culver City and decide it's worth the drive up from San Diego to purchase (2.5 hour drive one way).

We call in advance to confirm price and availability, and we agree to pay list price. The sales agent informs us that there will be additional fees and we say that's ok, of course with any car sale you need to pay licensing, etc. The agent sends paperwork to us and we fill out on the drive up. We let him know we're on the way and will be there soon to purchase the car.

When we get there, the agent now informs us that there are "aftermarket upgrade fees", and we're not talking a few hundred dollars, but a full $2500 over the agreed upon list price, in addition the additional standard fees. The car that's listed for $13,900 is not going to be nearly $18,000 out the door.

You can see in other reviews here that this is something they do regularly. We decided to walk instead of deal with their dishonest practices. It ends up costing the three of us over 5 hours each.< /Review>< pictures>

This dealership needs to be overhauled by corporate.
They voided my factory power train warrenty becuase my truck showed use off road... my Tacoma...
No I’ve never rock climbed, yes It has driven in dirt.
Between this dealerships complete lack of education of what’s going on, and corporates lack of care that the dealership is creating their own rules.
They clearly are braking the laws referring to
Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act
(Pl 93 673)
United stated federal Law.
Don’t let these massive companies  screw you once you’ve paid them everything you have.< /Text>

I went there for my car's inspection service, which took a total of 80 minutes. Everyone was wearing masks and there were enough chairs for people waiting to maintain social distancing. They used gloves and a wheel cover to drive the car. Professional and caring. Very satisfied</Text>

Terrible. That's all I can say. I went for a regular check-up and maintenance. I scheduled for an appointment and still had to wait more than 3 hours. The guy didn't even let me know it was done. He said he sent a message but had an error, and that's it. I'm not even sure what they have done to my car because it is still having the same issue, and I wasn't even debriefed. Don't want to come to this Culver City branch ever. Rather go to the Santa Monica branch. Overall, I'm growing more distant with Toyota. I'll never buy Toyota anymore. I'm so disappointed in overall Toyota's image.<//text>

< review>
Went in looking at an 86, test drove it didn’t like it. Showed this man ROBERT who was a part of the KBB team on the lot actually helped me way more than Chike, who was originally assigned to me. Robert seen me standing there waiting for some help, kindly asked if I wanted water and if anyone’s helped me. I said yea but I have no idea where the guy went 🤷🏽‍♂️. Long story short, I got a way better vibe from this guy. Who likes people that work at car dealers? but when I asked him if the corolla APEX came in stick, what do you know, he brought one off the roof for me to test drive. Kind guy, had the exact story I did with my baby mama, so I got his real emotions out, and we actually shared some words. He didn’t give me the feeling like I was going to get screwed or jab me too hard. They ended up giving a deal on a car that their only producing 120 of. Thanks Robert! You should get the raise 🤙🏽</review>

I went to Culver City Toyota on 10 August 2020 for a recall and to check the power steering. My Tacoma was under warranty. I came in at my appointment time of 8am and was greeted by Edward who was nice enough although not very informative as to how they were going to process my vehicle during this visit. He even stated that I may be charged a $130-$160 diagnostic fee although my truck is under warranty. They did not charge me, thankfully and rightfully so... he stated he would need the truck for a “few hours”. Fast forward to 1:31pm, after leaving voicemail messages, text messages via their auto text system, multiple phone calls, multiple times on hold I finally receive a call backs from Edward staying that the service would be complete at 5-5:30pm which was a far cry from the originally stated timeline of a “few hours” and no updates/contact until I had to reach out for hours. Since it was going to be so late I had to work in the afternoon and unable to pick up my truck at 5:30pm and had to have my paperwork left with the sales department as they were open later. At 7:45pm I picked up my truck after standing in the sales lobby for 10 min with zero acknowledgement from anyone, finally I approached someone who showed me the way to where my keys were at, the sales manager office I presume.. I communicated that I was here to pick up my truck etc and it was met with “what’s your last name” “do you owe money”. I answered their rude phrased questions and received zero eye contact, zero thank you for coming and zero directions as to where my truck was so I walked out with my keys. Another what I presume more nice salesman showed me where my car was as he was visibly shocked by the other two rude sales managers interaction with me. I will NEVER be back and will tell my story to everyone I know so they don’t have an experience as I did.< /Text>

<review>We had a spectacularly negative experience with the sales department when we bought our vehicle to the point we almost called off the transaction and walked away. Had we not already transferred ownership of our trade in we would have taken our business elsewhere.

Today we arranged for our vehicle’s first service. So far, the service department has been highly professional. I’d especially like to acknowledge the great work from Dave and Kevin.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Called Tuesday and made appointment for Wednesday 8:15AM for 6 month service. There were a number of cars ahead of me when I arrived at 8AM but a guy logged me in and the 6 month service was done in an hour with good documentation. I sat on a bench outside but under the entrance canopy shade so social distancing was easy.

12 month service 3-15-2021. Took truck in at about 10:10AM for the 10AM appointment. Only snafu was I was told it would take 2.5 hours. After 3 hours on the same bench as last time, at 1:08PM, I texted my advisor and got the truck. I thought they'd text me when it was done. But, service was complete.< /text>

I just bought a brand new Toyota rav4hybrid from this dealership and it was an amazing experience!! Viktor was so helpful in providing me with an easy and smooth process in deciding on the right car and explaining all the features, as well as working with me to get a great financial deal. He was personable, easy going, and very helpful!

Everyone I encountered was also very helpful, kind and genuine. Setting the appointments up (including me needing to reschedule one day) was super easy. I also never felt pressured at all when I was there which was really nice. I had a really enjoyable time buying my car here and I would definitely recommend checking out Culver City Toyota!</Text>

If it wasn’t for David Evansco I would be giving Culver City Toyota one star. Mostly from the sales department. David however, treated me with respect and kindness and did everything he could to get me the best service on my van. I’m super grateful for his transparency and professionalism. I would come back for the service just because of him. I’m so grateful for everything he did to make sure I was happy with the service.<//Text>

My boyfriend and I bought a used Camry here in August of 2019 for our growing family. We wanted to be on a budget yet have a safe car for our baby, but we were charged a lot of extras unknowingly because we rushed through the paperwork and signatures. Later on, the manager kindly helped us adjust our contract and removed these add-ons except for the most expensive one, $995 for Theft Patrol. After speaking to a sales manager, general manager and finance manager, no one would help us remove the charge because supposedly it's built in. I called Toyota Financial and they said it's not built in and that it's a 3rd party item. The used car had a sticker that said Pursuit Security Systems so it looks like it already had a different system. Even though this happened last year, it has still bugged me that this charge was added. The salesman told us we will throw in this, we will throw in that. And we assumed those things were complimentary as an incentive to buy this car. He wrongly told us that Theft Patrol gives us a discount on auto insurance but it doesn't. When I called for auto insurance quotes, no one offered a discount for Theft Patrol. The used Camry also had expired tags. We ended up being stuck with paying extra fees due to the expired registration and on top of that we are stuck with the $995 charge for Theft Patrol. Feeling discouraged because $995 is a lot of money we can't get back.<//review>

<Text>First of all, I am really disappointed because I went for the primary thing that was my oil change. And they didn’t change it when I specifically asked to the employee if they would be change my oil and he responded with a strong answer “yes and we will check your tires, rotation”
I am so disappointed also because even though I knew it was going to take some time to do my service’s car I waited almost 3 hours and just find out that they didn’t do the oil chance. It’s so unfair because yesterday was my only day off from the week, and I found out they didn’t do the oil change.  Why???! Why lied on my face, and say that they would take care of it? Just because I am woman!? Just because I’m a woman, I wouldn’t know about mechanic stuff?!! That’s is discrimination!!!
It’s so disappointment that have two car with this dealership and I was treated like this !!
It’s unbelievable!!!!!< /Text>< pics>

Arturo was extremely helpful when helping us purchase our 2020 Toyota Camry. He went out of his way to make sure we were cared for,  and was very upfront when it came to the deal. He didn’t make us only feel like customers but almost family. Amazing experience and i’m sure going to recommend him to my friends/family.<//Review>

My car was in your shop from 11am till 7pm for a regular service and potential brake change. I was informed it would be 1 hour for service and an additional 2 hours if brakes were needed. I inquired as to whether you use water or windshield wiper fluid for topping of the windshield fluid-I was told its just plain water. I asked why and I was told windex is expensive. I said if I wanted to put water-which does nothing for removing bugs off your windshield, I could do it myself. He put customer requests windex on the work order and it was still only water that was added. You stopped washing the cars, now you have started to put water instead of windex and I don't know what other shortcuts you are taking when you service my car as I don't know how to check the rest of the fluids you supposedly top off when service is done.

I had to call your service dept after 3 hours of your dept having my car and no service tech calling me to tell me IF I even needed brakes or not. Your tech told me brakes would cost approx $400 and I said I was told $200 last week when I called in. He said that is just for the brake pads but the rooters need to be resurfaced as well and that makes it come out to $400. Thank god I remembered the coupon you guys mail to me every week or so. On there it clearly stated $199.95 for complete brake service-brakes pads and resurfacing of rooters included. If I wouldn't have recalled just then, I would have been overcharged $200. Thats not ok.

When I asked why my car took so long to get done, I was told it was an unusually busy day and my car was serviced in the order that it came in. I believed that till I got to the dealership. I was the last customer in the entire service department. At that point I got upset and told your tech, That was he really going to tell me that my car was the last one that came in that day for servicing as I was the last customer leaving-or did he want to take some responsibility and own up to having messed up by forgetting my car somehow. He did offer me a free service after I got angry at being lied to.

I've had a 3 Toyota Priuses for the last 10 years and each year your service department gets worse. I won't be coming back after my 3 pack of prepaid service runs out till you treat your customers better.

Thanks for listening.</review>

Sales person told me i still could find another car loaner in 7 days if i could find less than Toyota's interest. I made a $10K downpayment. Made a follow-up in less than 3 days, and found out they've already entered it under Toyota car loan. What a way to trick your customers!<//Text>

< review>
This dealership has caused so much stress in my life since purchasing my used car in May 2020. They STILL have not completed the paperwork to transfer the title of my vehicle. I have ongoing investigations with my lien holder and local DMV investigation office.

In August, this dealership started hanging up on me and ignoring my calls so I had to use a private number to get through to anyone. I spoke with three different sales managers and never got an answer from any of them. When my lien holder finally found out what was going on through the investigation, the general manager called me to let me know what happened, and I found out he NEVER even knew about my situation despite being told by the sales managers that he would be contacted.

The DMV clerk at this dealership never finished the paperwork and never responded to my voicemails. I was told by the general manager that they were submitting the paperwork and I would receive my registration tags within six weeks. Well, TEN weeks have gone by so I call the DMV and find out that the dealership still has not finished the paperwork.

Lawsuit pending. Would NOT recommend this dealership to my worst enemy.</review>

Oscar the service manager tried to sell me on a $170 wheel alignment that my Prius with 10,000 miles and 7 months of ownership didn’t need. It also took 2 hours for an oil change, so if you value your time or money, you might consider somewhere else once out of complementary Toyotacare< /Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Completely negative experience. I left my car for a wheel alignment. I was texted a few hours later that my car was available. I had asked whether the tech crew could use a grease gun to fill a bushing. I was told they don’t have that equipment. Seems unlikely, but fine. When I arrived to pick up my car, my service technician was on lunch at 4pm. Someone else ringed me up for my wheel alignment (after I had installed after market parts). I had to ask them about the tech notes on my car about a torn front axle boot. No one had called me prior to ask if I would like this to be fixed. I asked the service rep if it would be ok to drive home or if I should get it fixed now. The person told me my rep would get in contact with me and I should be fine heading home. When I arrived home, the axle boot was completely destroyed and the axle grease has sprayed all throughout my wheel well. Horrible service, horrible result. It will take me days to clean my car from this. But I will never bring my car here again.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Everyone I encountered from Toyota of Culver gave 10/10 customer service. They are on the ball making sure that they do everything they can to make the customers experience swift and easy. I especially like to give a shout out to Oscar Romero. Thanks Oscar for your excellence in customer service! I should’ve gotten everyone else’s name, I know there was a George and two ppl at the car rental service that just made my day:)< /review>

Robert Escobar and Richard from the Service Department made my first service visit to Culver City Toyota very easy. They answered all my questions and concerns regarding the service and the job was done in timely manner. Pick up was very easy. Leaving 4-stars for I have not dealt with another department of the branch but I’ll definitely be open to returning and recommending them. Thanks!< /text>

Service was great, but I don't know why every time right after I exited TOYOTA my hubcaps always fell on the road. Last December in 2019 I lost one and few days ago I lost two hubcaps. Their bodies were all on Venice and Culver intersection. I know this seems pretty common but at least they should give me a heads-up that they are about to detached. Anyway, losing three hubcaps has mede me think there is a systematic issue that needs to be addressed. I will not go again next time.<//review>

Terrible experience at Culver City Toyota. I brought my car in for an oil change at 10:30. I was told it would take an hour and a half. Two hours later, when I still hadn’t heard anything, I sent a text to the number where they told me I could reach someone. No response. An hour later, my boyfriend called them to find out it would be another half an hour. I text them at 2:00. This time, they deigned to reply. The car would be ready in 10-15 minutes. So I head over to the dealership, pick up the paperwork and drive my car home four hours after my appointment. They didn’t even bother to tell me my car was ready. Boo</Text>

<Text>The worst customer service. I drove a car that I was going to purchase, not only they try to convince me that the car included a special anti theft system which added up an extra 2K to the original price (which is insane, I have purchase toyota before and I know that can easily be taken off the car) they insisted that was part of the deal and they could not take it off which is a HUGE lie! but on the top right when I was negotiating the price the financial manager told me that the car "was already sold" after I had drove the car, we have been talking about the deal etc, at the end he said "it is already sold" WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< user>

<Time>1602892557510< /Time><rating>1</rating><Review>Very sad, had appointment for 7:45am, left my car.  Usually, they call me when my car is ready, but this time I walked to Toyota in Culver City just to make sure my car was ready.  They only texted me to ask me if I want to other services in my car, and I responded no, my car is one year and half new, it does not need anything.  I got fool with a truck last year, I took it for service, they charged me $900 and as soonest I brought it home my car went off, I have to pay a tow away to take back to the dealer, so they want $2500 extra or buy a new car, I still think this was a  set up for me to buy a new car.  I promised myself not to go back to this dealership, I might have to go to a regular auto shop. Also, when I went to pick up my car, no one wants to take responsibility who was supposed to call me that my car was ready.  Very poor service, they should be thankful they have xss a job.  Bunch of arrogants.</Review>< pics>

Initially the salesman was helpful and honest.
However, when it became time to
make a deal, there was undue high pressure from the business manager.
In addition, multiple hard credit inquiries were made (more than 5 or 6 in one day does NOT count as one)
Furthermore  a 900.00 "security system" kept being added to the LOI agreement, though I repeatedly said I did not want it.
Toyota is a great company but this dealership needs change.< /text>

A terrible dealership. They must not be interested in selling cars which is obvious with their poor star ratings. But experiencing it first hand they definitely are not interested in selling cars during a pandemic when most of the population are unemployed and the country is at the brink of economic collapse... but um... ok 👎🏾< /Review>

I love the convenience of making an appointment, dropping off my car and then getting a ride to work. It’s so easy that it helps relieve the stress of having to bring your car there in the first place!

The staff is super friendly and accommodating too. While George is my go to guy, everyone makes you feel comfortable and confident that you and your car will be well cared for.

Two reasons I didn’t give it 5 stars is that 1) I haven’t picked up my car yet; and 2) it is a bit expensive. In truth, you often get what you pay for, however; so I don’t complain too much and I know when I pick up my car that it will be great. If not, I know the staff there will help me navigate my options!</text>

Had a great experience here! Shally was my sales rep - she is really knowledgeable about the vehicles and was available when I needed assistance on her day off. Collins handled the finances. He is an absolute pro. Explained everything and helped me out more than I originally asked.
My lease was a little complicated and both of them went the extra mile to get it done. Thanks a lot guys! I highly recommend this place!<//Review>

Expedited service. Friendly attitude and took care of everything for basic service needs. They even let my lease service free of charge be extended by a few days.</text>

Friendly staff but messed up on my order.  Handed me parts for a Prius instead of a 4Runner.  Have to drive all the way back "an hour across LA traffic" to get mine exchanged.< /Text>

Just had a recall serviced on my car. A little nervous to go into the dealership during this pandemic, but luckily I didn’t have to! Culver City Toyota has really stepped up their game and truly cares about their customers. They offered complimentary valet service to come and pick up my car from my house back to get serviced, and back to my place (I live less then 10 miles away)! It was super easy to schedule online and was contacted by Tiffany during the whole process for each step. I do recommend though making sure you are available the whole day, as they are taking extra precautions which do sometimes cause delays. Great service as always!</Text>

<Text>I am from Long Beach had to go all the way to this dealer because my dealers locally did not have any trucks in stock my new truck had an issue with their theft patrol alarm Messing with my key fobs not letting them work properly had them remove the alarm system and that fixed the issue with the key fobs ask for a refund on the alarm they denied refund they want to me to go back and try to get the problem fixed with the alarm another issue I had is when they swapped out some items from my other truck they put a scratch in my truck they paid to repair it but the scratch did not end up being repairable I had to repaint or live with the scratch so I lived with the scratch on my brand new 2021 tundra I would not recommend buying a truck from here since their customer service is horrible next time I'll just order a truck from my local dealer and wait for it to come in< /Text><rating>1<//rating>< gmapID>

I called to see if Toyota Care would replace my flat tire. It's my first Toyota and I saw something about flat tire service. Culver Toyota said that it was covered and they would send a tow truck to pick up my car and take it to the dealership for the tire. I got a call asking if I meant for my car to be taking there. The guy said the tow truck just dropped the car off and left without saying anything. I told him it was for the flat and he said it wasn't covered and would be $255 for 1 tire. I told him I wasn't interested and would pick it up. I called the next morning (car still there) to see if they could service it since it's time and the car was already there. They set me up for a 845 appointment. I didn't hear back from Toyota at all. I call at the end of the day and they tell me my car was ready. I go first thing in the morning and I find out they didn't do anything at all. I told the guy I called and scheduled the appointment. He said I would have had to come in and tell them to work on my car even though it was already there and scheduled for maintenance. Very disappointing.</text>

<review>I dropped my car off as soon as they opened (7am); Second car in. I saw my car be driven around presumably to be serviced (recall appointment).
After three hours in waiting room, I left to get food and noticed my car parked in front with the number block on top. When I returned, I still saw my car there. I texted my service rep, who said to contact him with questions, about an update. No word.
After another hour (its been close to five hours since dropping car off) and no text back, I went up to a service rep. I was told my car wasn't ready and to wait for my rep. I told them that my car has been in the same spot for last 2 hours. When my rep, Edward, got me, he said it was (and has been ready).
I asked why have I've been waiting for so long if it was done hours ago. He just apologized and said he was busy.
I know this was a free service,  due to a recall... but that shouldn't have put me low on priority. Disappointing.< /review>< pics>

I have been testing water on trading in my car for a Corolla and wife and I found the right one at Culver Toyota. Manuel Martinez was my sales representative and I recomend asking for him. I can say there was zero pressure and the entire team who helped us was very profesional. We knew what we wanted and Culver Toyota made it happen.<//Review>

<text>Mark greeted me as soon as I entered. I could tell he was genuinely interested in helping me get into a car I loved. He was polite. He was knowledgeable. He was... cute. My deal wasn't an easy one. I actually had to go back to the dealership a second time to finalize some details, but Mark, gave me his cell number and in between visits he happily responded to all of my new buyer questions. In the end Mark, a manager named Tamer and the Big Boss worked with me to find a deal I could live with. I don't think I was an easy customer, but they never said so. They really did work and work to keep me as a customer. All I heard over and over was, "as long as you are happy." Thanks guys.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Text>I walked on to the lot in Culver City with a friend. In about 5 minutes, we were approached by a salesman. (Victor)
I had not planned on buying anything because I wasn’t sure if I had enough down to get what I wanted with the payment plan I wanted.
I found that after spending a half an hour with Victor, I got 90% of what I needed and/or wanted. I was able to get exactly what I expected to get knocked of the price on the tag. I got pretty close to my payment expectation.
It’s my first major purchase so, I believe it should help my credit score which is already ok. So far, I’m happy. I’m a little uncertain about the drivers seat. It doesn’t hug my back like I’m use to. I’ll try to adjust it. Victor was hilarious and put me at ease. If I buy something more expensive on the future, I’d like to make him some money.< /Text>< time>

Nina is the BEST. We've now worked out two deals, for a new and used car.  The whole process was crystal clear. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a new car. Very patient, understanding, and looks out for the client's best interest.</Review>

<review>First of all, I love my 2021 Corolla LE
The salespeople were very polite and cordial.

My complaint is the way the paperwork was presented to me.  When I bought cars from Toyota in the past, I got a long yellow contract with everything listed on one page. I signed on the bottom.  The new way are pages and pages where I had to sign or initial electronically.  It was very confusing to me, what am I signing for!  I have to add I am a senior citizen.

The problem is that when I met with the salesperson Karlen Gasparyan a nice man, he presented me with the total amount of the car. In it was added a GPS system (which I said I didn’t want ) Theft Patrol and ClearShield.  I stated I didn’t want any of those items and I was prepared to walk away.  He went to his sales manager and the price was reduced.  When he presented the new price I was so confused and tired that I accepted. When I got home I saw that 995.00 and 295.00 were added (on a sheet entitled Pre-Contract Disclosure. Optional goods and Services totaled 1290.00.

I went back to the dealership and questioned this to a manager. I was told that these items were installed on the car and couldn’t be taken off and were on all the new cars.  So, why not list them and add them to the Manufacturer’s retail price so one knows what the true price is.  And if I was prepared to walk away, would  the manager reduce the price of the car.  I was given a lot of double talk.

This experience has soured me on dealing with Culver City Toyota.

Unclear and confusing paperwork, bad signing practices, tricky add ons, condensation from manager.  I won’t even mention the added service packages I was presented with ( which I declined)

I feel I was taken advantage of as a senior citizen and woman.<//review>< pictures>

David Cruz was very helpful and willing to negotiate a deal for my parents new 2019 Corolla LE. He gets 5 stars!!! Very nice and professional! However, 1 star rating because our experience turned negative when we were introduced to Ish from finance. He became very angry and was giving us an attitude for not wanting to get GAP insurance. Poor communication skills and didn’t even bother to walk us out into our new car. He should be more respectable-ISH!<//Text>

We purchased a Dodge Ram truck last week. Our salesman Miguel Cervantes was great! He was a very easy going guy and worked with us through the deal. They even gave us the full trade in value for our vehicle that we asked for. Everything was perfect until we got a call from their finance director named Steve a few days later. He was trying to strong arm us because he had not received a check from our credit union (we were pre-approved with an 800 credit score). He said I should have got the check from our credit union and overnighted it to him! Really? I just spent $55,000 at your dealership and your pressing me for a check from my credit union just a few days later. Our credit union (Alta One) which is great had already funded the loan and had mailed the check to Steve. Salesman Miguel gets an A+. Financed Director Steve gets a 🖕🖕🖕<//Review>

Take your car here if you want to give your money away for bogus repairs that do not exist.
They told me I needed a new radiator and oil pan and would cost $1695.
Also stated that brakes (I just had replaced in Feb) needed replacing because they were worn.
I took to my personal mechanic for second opinion he said my oil cap was loose and there was no sign of any other leakage on my car 😠.
He said I could drive my car from Cali to NY and back and it would be just fine.
All Toyota dealerships are scam artists.
Always get a second opinion.
DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!</text>

If you want to get Above and beyond service make sure to request an appointment with Oscar Romero, he is the best service advisor ever. He is patient, he explain everything to you. He have a wonderful personality. I definitly found my new service guy and I will definitely refer my friends to him.

Brandyn is an excellent salesperson.  I feel very lucky to have randomly come across Brandyn and the Toyota he sold me online.  He is extremely patient with tightfisted and very practical customers like myself.  In addition, he is very knowledgable about all aspects of his business.  He made sure that I was protected with the 7-year-or-7500-mile-free-service package.  I can breathe easy now.  Thank you, Brandyn!  Every person with whom I came in contact at Culver City Toyota was respectful, efficient, friendly, and professional.  I literally had no reason not to purchase a car!  I'm a happy customer.  I highly recommend Brandyn and Culver City Toyota.< /review>

<Text>From buying my car to getting my service for my car, it has been a very unprofessional process. My car was ready for over an hour after getting my service and I received absolutely 0 notification that it was ready, having an hour+ of my time waiting wasted! I had to go find and talk to 3 different people there asking about my car letting them know that I’ve been looking at my car for over an hour sitting before they finally let me know it was ready. They said their system was down and that’s why I never got a text saying my car was ready.

The next best thing to do if you KNOW your system is down would have been to come in to the room where everyone was waiting for their cars to let me know it was ready.<//Text>< gmapID>

I have mixed feelings about the place. On the one hand I was about to easily get an original key cut at a reasonable price and they provide me with the key code which I can use in the future to get a duplicate at any locksmith. On the other hand I previously had them quote me $800 to replace a water pump I was able to do on my own in a couple of hours. Sure relaxing the water pump was a tight fit but they seemed to think the engine would have to be pulled. Overall not bad.<//Review>

I have a Toyota which has the problem of paint peeling.I repainted the roof and the trunk and paid for it .Recently I received a letter from Toyota company that there has been  some defect in their painting work on certain models  and the company will pay to correct it.After sending  copy of what I had paid ,they sent me to Culver city center for inspection while the peeling was getting to other areas of my car they refused to repaint it and never paid for the bills I had paid. This is their way of costumer care !!! WASTING YOUR TIME.< /review>

<Text>I appreciate that everyone that helps me is nice and professional here. However the last 2 times i got my car serviced they just forget things. Last time they forgot to reattach the clips underneath the car so the skid plate opened up the following day while i was driving home from work. Today, they forgot to reset the “needs maintenance” light so I’m driving around w it still on and it’s frustrating. Maybe they need to revamp the check list and get another set of eyes on the car before it leaves the service area.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2b980b3314815:0xec119ffd24caaf09<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Very accommodating, helpful, and goes the extra mile. Dave was quick to respond to each and every one of my questions, and talked me through each element of how to help my car run in tip-top condition. I highly recommend these folks. You’re in good hands with them.</text>

They were all very nice and the place seemed very neat and clean. Oscar helped me out a lot and was really nice. He was new but he knows a great deal about customer service. Prices were high, but at no fault of those who worked there. They even provided shuttle services and the driver Manny, was so sweet. Overall, thanks to Oscar and Manny, I had a good experience here.< /Review>

They make service check-ups easy and carefree! Each time I have gone the customer service has been pleasant. I appreciate the coffee/hot beverages and water available and it has taken less time to complete  then quoted at drop off, which is always a welcome surprise!</Text>

Both my wife and I get our cars serviced there. I've never had a problem with them. Yeah, you pay a bit more but they are upfront with estimates and they don't hassle you to do extra service work. Friendly staff that makes sure you leave there satisfied. Plus they offer a free ride to and from the dealership.< /text>

My service advisor, Tiffany Techaira, gave me all the information I needed, all the options available, and kept me updated on the progress. I received excellent customer services, fair pricing, and drove away with a car operating smoothly and fully.

<Text>3 stars because I’ve received bad service over the phone and good service in person.

I received a notice regarding a recall on my car and was give them option to call or go online to schedule. So I first scheduled online and after going back and forth for 20 mins I was told I’d have to call to schedule a service. Why tf would you put in a letter that I could do it online. So I called was on hold for 10 mins and was given the option to get a call from the next available operator, which I did. 3 hours later, I got a call and was able to schedule it. Tell me why the hell is the Toyota dealership going to call the day before my appointment to tell me they have to check if they have to order the part and they’d call me back. Mind you I scheduled my appointment on a Tuesday , and it was for Saturday morning. Never got a call back that Friday.

Saturday morning and Osbaldo gives amazing customer service. I mention to him no one called me back yesterday and tells me he can tell off the bat if they have the parts for the recall. They do and I get a call to come back and pick up my car in 2 hours.

2 hours later, now 12 pm— I get a call from the same woman telling me they have my parts. I tell her right away I just picked up my car. She goes oh ok, have a nice day. Good thing she doesn’t work at a hospital cos if anyone relied on her they’d probably be dead.<//Text>< pics>

<review>I was told that my service would take 2 - 2.5 hours and it’s been over 3.5 hours. It seems like I always have to wait for an extended period of time whenever I’m here. Add an hour+ to whatever time frame they originally tell you. All I came for was an oil change, rotation of my tires, and an inspection.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I did not have a good car buying experience here. First off, the sales woman,Shally, blatantly lied to me about the cost of the car. She tried telling me I was paying 2k less than what the MSRP receipt said. We got into a huge argument about this. She refused to admit her dishonesty. Secondly, they tried to to slip in a 72 month loan to lower my car payment. Not once did she ever say the agreed car payment was for 72 months. It wasn’t until the  end of the buying process I realized what she had done. I immediately said that I was not interested in a 72 month loan. She started arguing with me and it turned into a very uncomfortable experience. I’ve bought several different cars from different dealerships in my life, and this experience was by far the most sleezy. I did not appreciate the dishonesty of the sales person. This experience made me question ever buying another Toyota again.</Text>< pics>

Had a wonderful experience at Culver City Toyota. Victor was so kind and patient with me. I had specific things I wanted to come with the car and I had a budget I wanted to stay in. Victor went above and beyond to accommodate me. He was truly the best to have as my salesperson. I am having my family go to him for their next Toyota’s and I will be a loyal customer to him and Culver City Toyota forever now. Thank you</review>

<rating>4<//rating><text>The sales assistant who helped us was lovely (I unfortunately can’t remember her name but she was Nordine’s assistant) and was the best part of our visit. She was kind, not pushy, very helpful, knowledgeable and attentive. She even delivered our car for us! She's great! I’d 100% love to speak with her again. The salesman that we had an appointment with (Nordine) didn’t interact with us too much and we did have to wait a while to finally speak with him so we could actually try to buy the car. It seemed liked we had to wait for him specifically even though there were other salesman milling about.

One downside: I feel like they sold us an anti theft/tracking service that wasn’t asked for. When I noticed a $1000 charge outside of the price of the car and registration fees they said it’s a “mandatory system the dealer requires" and that it’s "equipped to all of the cars” (that price seems to be baked into the advertised price of the car). When I asked about what it was and if we could remove it (since we didn’t want it) they said no “it’s mandatory.” BUT once they agreed to lower our price we come to find out they took the money out of the price of this tracking system and not the price of the car itself. Weird. Not trying to say they did anything malicious and maybe there’s a good reason they offer it, but it feels like a sales tactic to raise the prices of the cars without real precedent. Maybe that’s me projecting and I don’t want to slander their name (since overall we had a good experience) but as a first time buyer it felt weird.

Also the tracking system (once you buy the car and download this app) is not very well designed, seems a bit cheap, and not worth the $995 price tag. It doesn’t look like something I would buy on my own volition, but maybe the functionality is the important part. Only time will tell.

Overall decent experience. The car was great. Super clean, well maintained, the staff is nice and the selection of cars was plentiful. The only weird stuff was the tracking app, the super long wait, and the general feeling that they didn’t care if we bought something or not (it didn’t feel very much like they were really trying to sell to us -  maybe they were just busy?), we’ll probably consider going back to this dealer if we need another car in the future.

Again the assistant was the best part of our experience. She’s wonderful and I would 100% recommend she be made a full salesperson.<//text>< pics>

Everyone I dealt with at the dealership was friendly, helpful and pleasant. Viktor is a great, low pressure salesman and he led me through the process. Marco gave me good advice about financing and finally Gianni in financing was very helpful. This was a startlingly smooth, satisfying and successful experience. Thank you!<//text>

Lack of communication, especially in the service department. I have been trying to get a document from the service advisor team for a week, and it has been like pulling teeth. The sales team is a pit of vipers, and frankly, fit the "sleazy" car salesman stereotype. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone, even my worst enemy - and it is unfortunate, because when I first started my relationship with them in 2015, it seemed to be much more customer-oriented. Not sure what happened in the last 5 years. You would have much better luck with a smaller Toyota dealership, like in Marina Del Rey.<//review>< Time>

I never had a bad experience at this location which is why I came back for my 3rd service. I was helped by John this time and he was friendly but the service took way too long. I was waiting for way too long. My appointment was set at 9am which I showed up on time but I didn't get my car back until 2pm! At 11:17am I asked how much longer it would be and John estimated at 1.5 to 2 hours. That clearly wasn't accurate. I asked again at 1:50pm when my car would be ready and didn't get a response until 10 minutes later that my car was ready. Conveniently after seeing him walk back in with his food. I understand that everyone needs a break but at least pass the task to someone who will help me get out as soon as possible.</text>

<review>Asked for a quote for a 2020 Tacoma. They slapped $5,000 to the MSRP, stating that their vehicle, that has been on the lot for over 10 days, was one of the only 3 in the state of California. I understand supply and demand, but a $5,000 premium is overboard. After no negotiations, the sales representative failed to return my calls. What ever happened to paying MSRP for a hot truck? Toyota has created their own price gouging market because of "COVID-19". Sad that Toyota dealers are hanging onto their inventory and marking it up beyond belief for people that need reliable transportation. I am pretty turned off by Toyota at this point, and think I may wait until the 2021 Ford Bronco is released. Do yourself a favor and avoid this dealership.</review>< Pics>

Luis was great at helping me this morning. I went in because my engine light was on. They were fast getting my in and out. I requested a shuttle service and because my route is different from others, they got me a Uber. They called me after 2 hours and says my car is fine and waived the diagnosis fee. The facility is beautiful and comfortable if you have to wait for you car.<//Review>

<Text>After purchasing my vehicle here I realized that not all dealerships are the same. We all know, heard, or have experienced the negative side of buying a car through a dealership in the past so I was a bit hesitant to go here for my service. I had an airbag recall on my purchase and I brought it back to the Service Department for inspection. Oscar Romero received me and he was very professional with my service and the repairs needed. I didn't plan on getting anything done with my car besides the airbag issue but he ordered for a full inspection to be done. I was told that a ball joint was worn out and needed replacing. Usually I would've had to pay the $100 deductible for the extended warranty I got on the car but he was kind enough to waive it without asking. I shared with him that I drive my car for work, all day, and he recognized that my car is my work horse and needed it back in top shape. He went above and beyond what was requested and provided excellent customer service. Now the car drives better, and I feel more confident that taking my car to the Culver City Toyota Service Department will be a much better choice than the mechanic down the street. They open early and close late, they can provide you with a rental if needed (like I did), and it was an overall great experience. Driving in L.A. means having your car in top shape, traffic and the roads alone can give it a beatdown, and now I know that my dealership can provide both great sales and customer service. I commend your entire team for your professionalism and dedication to the client's safety and overall satisfaction. Thanks Oscar, I'll be bringing my car to you guys from now on.<//Text>< Pics>

I did the valet service due to COVID-19... and it was INCREDIBLE! They texted me the night before to confirm, and then called right before sending someone out, to ensure I was home. They put the plastic coverings on the car before driving off, and then kept me up to speed on the car. When it was done, I paid over the phone, they drove it back, removed all the covers, I signed the receipt, and they were off! I hope they keep this service when social distancing is done- this was AMAZING! SO much better than driving around Los Angeles in a van to pick up everyone else!</Review>

I have had to go 2-3 times to this location because I leased a car and the staff did not do the paper work correctly. I couldn’t drive my car for a week because they sent the paper work to the dmv for the car registration 2 weeks before the paper work was due. I spoke to Steve over the phone and he acted like he never spoke to a customer in his life. We argued over the phone, it was not pleasant. I would not recommend this location. I Have been treated better at other dealerships.</text>

<Text>The staff at Toyota in Culver City was absolutely wonderful! But from every dealership that we’ve ever bought from when you take a car in for its maintenance they at least clean the car for you we were very disappointed that they did not take the time to wash our vehicle and return it clean and shiny. We pay for a monthly car wash service so it’s not about the wash itself… It was more about the customer service experience.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>It was so easy and convenient to make my appointment online. Everyone was friendly when I arrived and at least 3 people asked if I was being helped, while my rep, Mark Iraheta, was on his way! Mark was super helpful, alleviated my anxieties over getting the right services for my car and was just a nice guy throughout the entire process. I was able to communicate via text during the time my car was in service, which is a luxury given my job, and that allowed me to feel connected when questions arose about other possible service options. A car is an expensive possession and I have to accept that; but good customer service helps you spend the right money at the right time and leaves you feeling respected and valuable. Mark and the team at Culver City Toyota made me feel just that!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I have a pleasant experience when I checked in my car (prius) yesterday July 15, 2020. John, the service representative who checked me in was helpful and friendly. I was there to reprogram my remote, change the locks for my car.  I mentioned to him that I want an oil change for my Prius too , so I don’t have to go back again.  He offered the oil change special for $129 which I agreed.  Today, when I picked up my prius back, I found out I was not charge for the oil change. So I called back and inquire if my car has an oil change. The person whom I spoke with put me on hold. When she gets back to me , she told me she spoke to John and John told her that he did not order for the oil change because he just want my car serviced for the remote and locks. I was very disappointed because I have to go back again to have my car oil change which is very inconvenient for me coz I work during the day and I have to take another time off for It. I guess you don’t want my money, so I’m going back to Toyota Glendale. I’ve been going there for my oil change and I have a very good experience with that dealership even I live close by to Culver City .. Very disappointed...<//text>

Got a 2020 C-HR XLE today :) Arrived @9am done by 11am. Although it took longer than i expected, we got it done and that's what matters. Met with Mr. Karlan Gasparyan, had my Financing offer letter with me but they were able to find me a much cheaper rate on my budget so i settled with the dealership's lender. I asked them if they could deliver the car since im having a migraine attack, Mr. Karlan kindly said that he would drive me home and he can just take a uber/lift back at the dealership.

The dealership was understaffed when i came and there's people coming in, that's why the wait is understandable and also, another reason why it took longer is because i had to get a new insurance as well since i canceled my prior insurance 2 weeks ago not knowing i would get a car...

All in all..i am satisfied with their Customer service 😀</text>

<text>Tried to set up a test drive for a new Supra. They quoted me $100,000 dealer markup for a total price of $157,988 plus tax and fees, and in bold included that the car could not be test driven before purchase. I've uploaded a picture of their response email, we'll see if it shows up.

I bought an F type instead, couldn't be happier. They just emailed me again asking if I was still interested, which reminded me that I should leave a review.</text><resp>{'time': 1572285966904, 'text': 'Matt, we are sorry that you feel this way about your experience.

The internet sales manager, Brandyn, was very pleasant to deal with and worked hard to get us a good deal and keep us as customers.  Much of the interaction with his dealership, however, was not so enjoyable.

This was a costco transaction and I'm pretty sure without their lid on things it would have gone worse, even, than it did. As it was, the transaction took a lot of hours despite our knowing pretty much exactly what we wanted and needing no finance department interactions.

This review, therefore, is for the overall experience at CC Toyota.  Not with the specific salesman whose advocacy and guidance was appreciated. Rude phone calls and less-than-truthful rotating claims for others there were pretty irritating.  Being held for "just another minute" for several hours is infuriating, but under conditions of forced, repetitive, nauseating and loud Xmas jingles, it's just torture.  Watching dull-eyed employees wander aimlessly around and into and out of offices that apparently we are waiting for, overhearing mirthful conversations of sweet nothings while we're just twiddling our thumbs, missing appointment after appointment for the less-than-truthful time sink that this all was -- all this was really not a great good time.  If I had to do it again, I'd input a different zip code to Costco's database to obtain reference to a different dealership. The proximity was nice, but not worth it.  I'm not sure another dealership would have been better, but I'd give another a try if I were doing it again and I would not recommend this experience to others.  Sorry.  --- wait -- I would recommend the Costco venue, just not via CC Toyota.< /review>

<text>So far. My experience hasnt been great. When you shop for a car, you want to feel like you are being taken care of. Instead, I feel like I am not a priority.

I purchased a car yesterday, I waited around all day they said it would be ready to drive off the lot.

At 6:30pm the saleman told me it would be ready at 4pm tomorrow Friday (today.)

After calling the salesman 3 times (he never called me like he said that he would) I just found out the car wont be ready until tomorrow- "probably." There goes my Saturday plans! I told the salesman that it wasnt fair that I am lighter in the pocket thousands of $$s but no vehicle, and not being treated with excellent customer service. He finally agrees that I can come and get it when they open tomorrow (Saturday) at 9 am, but then sounded like he wasn't even going to be there...? Also, if I want them to provide a ride there, Id have to wait until 11 am. So - another all day debacle. My weekend plans with family and the road trip plans that necessitated the car to begin with -- all are now shot to hell.

I feel like I picked the wrong salesman, and I have this AWFUL feeling in the pit of my stomach with buyer's remorse.

It's only been 24 hrs and I regret buying my car here so much. I could have gotten this same car pretty much anywhere, but thought I would get A1 treatment at a dealer like this.

So far, Ive been left an anxious nervous wreck.

Now excuse me, while I try to figure out MY OWN WAY to the dealership tomorrow morning, while knowing full well the salesman wont be there when I arrive and so I will have to go through serveral people and explanations to find and confirm my car and drive away with it.

I dont wish this on anyone.< /text>< user_id>

I ASK IF HE ÇAN EXPLAIN WHAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACE SOON AND HE JUST POINTED TO THE PAPER AND SAID THIS ONE HERE. AN ADVISOR IS THE ONE WHO IS SUPPOSED TO ASSIST YOU WITH ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT YOUR VEHICLE AND AFTER SERVICING YOUR VEHICLE HE/SHE WILL ALSO EXPLAIN WHAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THE VEHICLE ON YOUR NEXT VISIT IF EVER) HOWEVER THIS NEVER HAPPEND CAUSE THE MANAGER AND MOST OF THE SERVICE ADVISORS AT THIS TOYOTA DEALER AND SERVICE CENTER ARE JUST LIKE EMPLOYEES WORKING AS A CASHIER AND HANDING CUSTOMERS THE RECIEPT AND THATS IT.  I WAS THINKING OF HAVING MY SERVICE DONE AT ANOTHER TOYOTA DEALER AND SERVICE CENTER AT FIGUERROA ST. WHICH IS 2 MILES FURTHER THAN CULVER CITY. DECIDED TO TRY TOYOTA CULVER AGAIN AND IF MANAGER OR ADVISOR DOESNT DO THIER JOB HOW THEY SUPPOSED TO DO SO THEN I WILL BE DOING MY BUSINESS AT TOYOTA IN FIGUERROA. HOWEVER TODAY I WAS SCHEDULED FOR THE AIR BAG RECALL AND BRAKE REPLACEMENT AND MY SERVICE ADVISOR WAS NAMED JOHN. TO MY SURPRISE IS HE EXPLAINED THAT THE ONLY THE FRONT BRAKE PADS NEED TO BE REPLACED AND THE REAR BRAKES IS STILL 50% HE EVEN SAID THAT BRAKE PADS USUALLY NEEDS CHANGING IF ITS AROUND 30%-25%. JOHN WAS THE ONLY TOYOTA EMPLOYEE AT THIS  TOYOTA SERVIÇE CENTER WHO EXPALINED AND ASK ME IF I HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, I ASK ABOUT MY POWER WINDOWS AND ABOUT THE PAINT PEELING, HE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING WHICH I UNDERSTOOD, UNLIKE THE OTHER ADVISORS U ASK THEM THEY ANSWER YOU WITH SOME KIND OF SCIENTIFIC EQUATION THAT YOU CANT UNDERSTAND. FROM NOW ON I WOULD LIKE JOHN TO BE MY ADVISOR HE IS FRIENDLY AND VERY HELPFUL, I JUST WISH TOYOTA CULVER CITY HIRES ADVISORS WITH AN ATTITUDE LIKE JOHN AND BECAUSE OF JOHN I WILL BE COMING BACK HERE AGAIN NEXT MONTH TO SERVICE MY VEHICLE. THÀNKS JOHN FOR HELPING AND ASSISTING ME TODAY.< /Review>< pictures>

The staff at Culver City Toyota are so nice and passionate. I wanted a specific car and I worked with them for a month to get it (I was willing to wait that long because working with them was easy going, not pushy at all which I've experienced at other dealerships). They continuously thanked me for my patience and gave me a great deal on the car. This was my third car purchased with Culver City Toyota and trust me when I say I will go back to them when I am ready to purchase another car!<//text>

<review>First of all expect to wait HOURS for any type of service here. I made an 8am appointment for AN OIL CHANGE and still waited 2 hours, which is the same time I should wait as a walk in.

Honestly I don’t feel like the employees care about working here. The lady who serviced me today had me waiting as I watched her be on her phone. They gossip in open spaces and use profane language around customers. Every time I come, most of the employees seem miserable, as if they’re watching the clock waiting to be off.

I literally only come here when it’s convenient and I don’t have time to go anywhere else.<//review>< pics>

<Review>Unacceptable delivery of a brand new vehicle. Car had glue all over, no floor mats were given upon delivery. Car was also not cleaned properly and had dirt stains. When we addressed the issue the sales person stated we would get them the following day. The following day is now here still no floor mats. We texted our sales person and no response. Called the dealership and sales person along with managers just dodge the situation saying only the sales person associated with the deal can help us. A simple process that can be done not taking more than 5 to 10 min of their precious time</Review>< Pictures>

Sales will rip you off! I leased a Prius and got a $1500 bill in the mail for the car I returned. Payed a crazy amount for the lease. I should have done my homework and researched more. I would never go back there or ever recommend anyone getting a car from there< /text>

< Review>
Had loan papers ready before hand and they took care of everything and walked me through the whole process. Very smooth. Matt in sales is great and very knowledgeable about cars. (Especially these newer cars with all the fancy feature). I was helped by 3 others and all of them did wonderfully. The mens room was clean and had in my opinion to many hand drying options but that is also very helpful. The store is mega clean only one spilled cup of coffee. (It was fake good sense of humor) Even if your window shopping check them out.</Review>

EVERYONE and I mean everyone was so knowledgeable,  and friendly,  while  being very professional.</Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Pics>

<Review>Thank you for the great service as usual.

The women with the short hair at the attending car pick ups was very condescending. I was patiently waiting for my car to be brought out. When I get my car, I was about to pull out. Another car speeds  that was serviced pulls up behind me and blocks me. I patiently waited. She tells me to wait, I'll hit the car. I knew that I wasn't going to hit the car. Also why would I ? I wouldn't want to ruin my car either or the other person's car.

But what I like to say is the person pulling up the car needs to take their speed down when they're bringing the car up, ( which was another service woman) it is dangerous.  No need to speed in a pick up area. She would have known that I was pulling out if she had paid attention.

Also back to the woman who is attending the car pick ups need to see the whole situation before she speaks out and talks to a customer like she is policing me. It was very condescending and rude.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Always a complete pleasure dealing with the folks over at CC Toyota. In particular, Demetrios - the service manager, and Ozzy - one of the service techs, are both fantastic! There is genuine care with regards to my vehicle, no unnecessary repairs and an ability to listen on both their parts - which you don't always get at car dealerships. Would absolutely recommend getting your car serviced here the next time the need arises.<//review>

<Review>The representative Gary G was helpful and I he was  knowledgeable. The process is good. No pressure.

On the other hand the gentleman who handled the paperwork was a different experience. He was friendly, respectful and I felt he knew his job. That was the problem. Just a little bit too much pressure to purchase after market add on insurance and warranty contracts.</Review><userid>102011036193330155598< /userid>< pictures>

<Review>Brandyn is a fantastic sales advisor at Culver City Toyota. If you're headed over there be sure to ask for him. Straight forward, hard working, and honest. What else could you ask for at a car dealership?

Be sure to check TrueCar before going, that helps with the negotiation process and ensure no confusion on what the best deal possible might be!< /Review>< Pictures>

The salesman was great and personable, I received help before I even got in the door. The only reason Im not giving 5 stars is because the dealership added a bunch of high profit margin, aftermarket things that weren't necessary and not included in the price tag. When I wanted to negotiate a lower price due to being essentially surprised by these aftermarket add-ons, the sales manager was extremely rigid on his pricing. I had to stand up and tell them I wasn't interested anymore to get them to budge towards a more reasonable price. Shout out to Kevin, the salesman that helped me through the whole buying process. He was very helpful and patient. He was also willing to go back and forth between his manager and I several times to negotiate price.< /text>

I have to recognized that due to my limitations with the car, down payment and monthly payment I did not have the freedom that other people may have and yet after twice from testing cars and paperwork we found the right car for me and it felt great!!!! Not just for me because I was comfortable with the test drive or because it was within my budget (which they totally respected) but I can tell if felt great for them too.

I was there for a long long time, I saw people come and go and all with their new cars. I did not see one client or customer upset, the energy in this place is great! And the courtesy from everyone feels genuine they are constantly checking in on you with water, coffee even if you are not their client. The crack jokes, they say hello, and continue to move to the next client, constant walking and moving parts.

Last, Gianni was amazing!! Direct, no bs and to the point and at the same time Courteous and patient because I had a million and one questions!!!it was a pleasure.

So, bottom line my experience was FANTASTIC and I Will definitely be referring my friends and people that need to buy a new or use car to Culver City Toyota!!!< /text><user>109333140624447304086</user>< Name>

They sold my information. Ever since a few days after starting my lease I've received nonstop spam phone calls and mail. When looking up the spam companies theres one thing all victims have in common: toyota culver city. Every single time I look one up theres at least one other person complaining that the calls/mail started right after buying or leasing there. This after I had to wait 5 hours after doing literally everything over the phone prior to coming in specifically to AVOID waiting that long. It was a horrible experience and I would recommend going through a secondhand dealer if buying in LA. Truly never had a great experience at any of the Toyotas here.<//review>

Sales people were patient and helpful. It was stressful in general buying a new car but Craig, Steve, and Nary were always friendly. They were in communication with us a few times since the first visit to Toyota to follow up on our questions. We decided to go back to make an offer on a car after finishing our research because of the overall positive experience.</text>

It charges $5K over MSRP for vehicles that are being sold for MSRP and below at nearby dealerships.  They say that they will get back to you with their best offer, but never respond.  When you call they are rude.

I will never return and advise that you go to other Toyota dealerships.  The ones further south are nicer.< /review>

From the moment Raul met me at the service entrance the service was excellent.
What I appreciated especially was Raul taking the time to answer my questions fully, and then assist me with getting ride’s to work and back to pick up the car.
He kept me posted on what was happening with my car too and educated me about choices that I had as to costs and what to do. The other service personnel were friendly and helpful too.
Thank youToyota, for a special servicing experience.<//text>

We bring our cars here for service and feel they do great work and leave the decisions to us. Very glad that we found this dealership. It’s a great location too.</review>

SCAM ALERT!!! PRICE RAISED DURING FINAL SIGNING.
Getting the deal done took over 4 hours; told them I need to leave and come back to finish the paperwork later, because I was running late to a meeting. They assured me it would be faster to just finish the paperwork and drive to the meeting in my new car.

The price of the car was marked up over $2000, and I did not notice. I was in a rush and my mind was on the meeting (ended up being an hour late). I did think the final price seemed a little high, but assumed it was due to taxes/warranty/gap policy/etc.

Luckily I still had their own website open from the night before I bought the car; the price of the car is clearly listen with the VIN of my car. I have posted pictures of Culver City Toyota's own website and auto trader. If you compare the listed internet price to the price in my lease, you can plainly see that they took advantage of the fact that I was running late to scam me.

Salesman: Nano
Sales Manager on Duty: Matt

After getting a huge run around, I thought I finally reached a breakthrough 2 days ago. Sales manager Ramonia Wright told me she would talk to the General Manager and get this situation straightened out. She told me she would call me back in 20 minutes  on Tue May 1.

A bit over 2 hours later, she called me back, told me that she spoke to the general manager and the dealership would cut me a check for the difference tomorrow morning (May 2). She said they couldn't do it that day, because it was too late.

Yesterday, (May 2) i received no calls from Ramonia or anyone else from the dealership. I was only able to get through to Ramonia's voicemail and received no call back.

I will update this review if the dealership follows through with the refund in a timely manner. If they do not, I will be forced to file a claim with small claims court, post this review on every platform possible, report them to the better business bureau, and report them to Toyota corporate.

I hope that it does not come to that, but at this point, every promise that has been given to me has been broken.</text>

<review>On the day of service I waited over two hours for a routine first maintenance. Come to find out the truck had been finished for over an hour while I was waiting in the lobby. I was never called or notified in any way it was done, as their policy is to do so. An employee told me they would make it up to me by giving me a discount on another service and that they would call me back the next day to inform me of what that looks like. They never did call back to this day and as of now that was weeks ago..<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I think my experience was fantastic. Down to me buying this used car. I didn’t feel pressured, they gave me my space and we were able to walk away with a deal that satisfied both parties. Would recommend for sure!

< review>
I've been coming to Culver City Toyota since 2010 when I purchased my Prius. I've always received great service here and, even if there was issue (which sometimes there are with car repairs) CC Toyota has always stood behind the repair and made it right. I've also experienced that they will do whatever is necessary to retain your business when you are good customer. This includes price matching. My car is older now with over 100,000 miles but I want to keep it so I do necessary maintenance. My service advisor, Edward Correa, is always honest about what is important and what can wait. But, recently, I got a list of things I knew were going to need attention as they had never been done during the life of the car. And it added up to a lot. I looked online to see if I could find a way to do the items and save money. And, having spoke with Edward about it and showed him the list and prices I got, he went to his manager and was able to match them. So don't write off the dealership as being too expensive. They want to keep customers coming back and, I feel, you have more peace of mind with a dealer that if something needs to be redone it will be. CC Toyota def retained my business and I appreciate that.<//review>

<rating>1</rating><text>This was, hands-down, the worst car-buying experience of my life. I arrived at the dealership at 9:30 am and left after 3pm in a rental car. After spending hours testing vehicles, trading in my current car and negotiating, I purchased the car (2019 Corolla)  only to get in it and realize that there was no cold air blowing. I was told that the car had just come in that day and it was sold to me without Toyota doing their new car diagnostic, which apparently requires the installation of a fuse related to the AC.

The sales person that sold me the car, Marcus, failed to mention that and basically went MIA after handing me the keys. After patiently waiting for over an hour for my car, I had to walk up to a sales manager and ask for an update, only for him to offer me a rental car to leave with until the car was ready TWO days later!

I left the dealership with a new car that I couldn’t even drive. Marcus, the sales manager nor anyone else offered any sort of ammends for this botched sales experience.

On Monday, I called the dealership for an update on my car and was told (after I had to call them) that my car was ready. I arrived and handed in the keys to the rental to Charles, who informed me that he doesn’t really “handle rentals” but will take the keys anyway. He didn’t provide me with any type of receipt of my return and I had to get the service manager involved just to simply get a handwritten note saying that I returned the car.

I roamed the dealership and found Marcus, who handed me the keys to my actual car. I got in the car, cranked it up and realized that the gas tank was only half full. I guess the days of getting a full tank of gas with a new car are gone at Culver City Toyota, as is any semblance of customer service.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Thanks Gary G! Very happy with my new Rav4. Gary provided the most competitive prices after speaking to several dealerships around LA/Valley. With the best price I had in hand, Gary was able to provide a better deal. Initially, they did not have the exact car I wanted in stock so he located one and transferred it over. I communicated with him from the convenience of my home and once we agreed on the price, I came in for a pleasant experience. Everything agreed to over the phone was the exactly the same when once I came in. Good experience, no pressure, and recommend you to work with Gary. Thanks again :)</Review>< Pics>

Amazing service! I have gotten brakes, tires, and the incredible oil change deal. I always ask for Jose Gamboa. He’s been my go-to for the last year or more. He never tells me that I need to do more than what I’m there to have done to my car. I hate being sold and that’s not how I feel when I go to him. It’s why I keep coming back.< /review>

Lots of bait and switch going on they promise you the world just until you're ready to sign whether to lease or finance and they go back on their promises. Highly recommend if you go there at least promise you things ask them to write it down on paper every time I made a request for that it came up with another excuse after 3 hours of sitting and waiting everything that has been promised was not delivered was extremely disappointed I got up and left.</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Date>1576632042999< /Date><Review>This past Saturday I took my car in for regular maintenance, and I had a nail in my tire. Mentioned the nail to the gal that checked me in.
Three hours later my car is done (this wait time is too long for a scheduled maintenance appt) and they say my tires are all in good condition. The person didn’t even notice the nail, after I told them about it. They then rechecked and confirmed there was indeed a nail in my tire.
She said that she would have her manager call me and they never did.
I am still driving around with a nail in my tire until I car find another three hours to get it fixed. This is not good service.<//Review></record>

<Review>I spotted a vehicle I was very interested in purchasing on Culver City Toyota's website.  I called to ask if it was still on the lot.  I got a call back saying it was, and would I like to schedule an appointment for a test drive?  I said yes and we agreed I would come in Saturday morning 3/9 at 9:00 a.m. for a test drive.  The saleswoman  sent me a calendar invitation which I accepted.  On Saturday morning I arrived for my appointment and was told that all the salespeople were in a meeting.  The receptionist sent someone upstairs to see if my salesperson would leave the meeting and come down for our appointment.  Nothing happened.  After 20 minutes, the receptionist said she wasn't sure when the meeting would end.  I left my name and number with the receptionist and asked for a call back.  It is now more than 27 hours later...no call, no email no text to apologize for standing me up.  I don't believe I have ever encountered such terrible customer service in any business.  This dealership needs to cover basic common courtesy during those sales meetings.< /Review><user_id>117178745500263108060< /user_id>< Response>

I all ready knew what vehicle I was looking for, through Culver City Toyota’s website and set up a reservation to meet with an associate. From there it was a stress free process from the test drive, too the signing of the paperwork with the financial services representative, ( but you know how long the problem is with the paperwork ) but they are really good at explaining what you’re about to sign. The only problem is parking around the dealership is extremely limited<//Review>

Dealerships are low-class places in general, but this place proves it very clearly!
*Salespeople are dishonest and fake.
*Managers are a bunch of liars. They change the general manager every two years.
*They promise you a good deal which they never get you
*They promise guarantee, customer loyalty, and much more useful stuff but they never provide you one.
*They never answer your phone after you bought/lease the car.
*They never call you back.
*They tell you this dealership is the number one in sales in the country, but the truth is they only sold 250 cars on March 2019 which is the terrible terrible number for the dealership.
*They said one of our typical salesmen made $50,000.00 last month, but the truth is their general sales manager made this last year.
DO NOT GO THERE!!!!<//text>

We were very pleasantly surprised with Culver City Toyota.  Marcus, David and Gianni were absolutely awesome.  I kept waiting for them to turn into the evil dealers actually quite the opposite.  Marcus took our first phone call.  David was amazing from the beginning to the end and Gianni in finance is both proficient and helpful.  I would definitely y from these guys again.  I highly recommend David and Marcus in sales and Gianni in finance!< /Text>

Went on a Thursday morning and there weren't any customers at all which is great. Salesman followed through with our agreed price and processed everything very quickly. Finance manager was a bit pushy on warranty stuff but he was great friendly family guy. There was a little issue with accepting debit cards for payment but Chase was five minutes away for getting cashier's checks. Got our car in the end though missing floor mats that we can pick up another day and everything was great. Interior was also very nice with free refreshment in the waiting room.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Gave it 2 stars because while they need your business they are great but once you buy the vehicle they won't get back to you and once it's time for your service make sure they do what they say they would do or did. Not even sure if they did any of the things they said they did. Would definitely go to another dealer for my next purchase and services.</Text>

I’ve been here 3 times, each time I go it takes a long time. Like they’ll tell me 2 hours require that I have an appointment, then it takes upwards of 3 hours maybe even longer. The Waiting area is nice, I don’t want to be here for 1-2 extra hours in addition to what I was originally told.<//text>

<rate>2<//rate><text>I had my 40k mike service, which includes replacing 3 filters.  To do the work, they tossed my trunk (the mats and the compartment under them but above my spare tire) but didn’t bother to put the mats or compartment back in place.  I discovered the mess a week later, when I went to load suitcases into my trunk in the rain.  I also asked them to replace my windshield wipers because they were falling apart, but in the rain discovered that they didn’t bother to replace the shredded windshield wiper on my rear window.  Communication was bad.  Tiffany was supposed to call me to let me know about the windshield wiper sprayers, which weren’t working, but she never called.  After several hours, I called her.  When I came to pick up my car after 6pm, it wasn’t where Tiffany said it would be.  It took 15 minutes and conversations with multiple people in sales and service to get it.  Overall, a bad experience.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< review>
Horrible experience! I went into Toyota Culver City today to get some information on a lease. VICTOR was absolutely terrible to me. I let him know I had not leased before and would like to understand how miles, maintenance, extra insurance, residual value, end of lease things etc all worked. He was incredibly rude, would not let me finish my sentences. I actually had to ask him to let me finish before he started talking again. I had a list of questions in my personal research and he said “oh so what else did other people on the internet say?” Rude! I asked if there were any hidden fees I should understand or  common mistakes/misunderstandings when leasing and he said “I don’t know, do you have any actual specific questions?” To which I said that is your job and he’s said “no it’s not” So RUDE. He had zero understanding, zero kindness, zero empathy for a first time leaser, acted like I was stupid, was incredibly unprofessional, didn’t seem to care AT ALL. About anything. Sleezy, rude, pretty mean, I could go on. I eventually just got up and left and said thank you and walked out. This puts a horrible look on Toyota and while I’ve been a loyal Toyota driver and love these cars, I cannot believe that this is the type of experience they want people to have and how they want their company represented. Victor should not be working there.</review>

< Review>
Had an overall great experience at Culver City Toyota. Jose Soto from Internet team was great, kept in touch and sent us a reasonable offer on a new vehicle we were interested in. We made an appointment to see the vehicle and were pleasantly surprised to find the vehicle ready, fueled and cooled when we arrived on a very hot day. Our salesman Craig Hayden was great, very informative and professional. There was no pressure or need to haggle on the price. Finance did take a while, but it was understandable being a busy Sunday afternoon. While we were going through finance our new car was detailed and topped off. As we were getting ready to leave Mr. Hayden came out and helped us link our phone and explained how the navigation system worked in our new car. He also called about a week later to see how we were doing with our new Toyota. Happy with our experience.<//Review>

Service seems to be getting worse here. I had a 12:30 appointment for a routine oil change. I was told that my car would be ready around 1:45. I texted the tech at 2:45 with no response. I finally got a call after 3 that my car was ready. It seems they don’t honor their appointment schedules.</text>

< review>
Brought my 2016 4Runner in a for a recall two weeks ago. I requested to have my brakes serviced and a service foreman also recommended an alignment as "recommended maintenance." (along with some other non-required "recommended maintenance" that he admitted upon my questioning that there were no issues present to recommend; throttle service, MAF service)  However I went ahead and had the alignment completed even though I never experienced alignment issues. Vehicle drove straight as an arrow the entire time I have owned it but did notice some mild tire wear on the outside of the tires. So I was in for a shock when I picked the vehicle up and all of a sudden my 4Runner could no longer drive in a straight line.
After bringing my vehicle back to Culver City Toyota 4 separate times they finally admitted their alignment machine was broken and provided me with a refund. Brought my vehicle to another Toyota dealership in the area for the same service ($30 cheaper) and the vehicle still WILL NOT drive straight. Prior to bringing it in to Culver City Toyota my 4Runner has driven perfect the entire time I owned it.
Long story short I brought my vehicle in for a recall and Culver City Toyota somehow completely wrecked my 2016 4Runner's steering with "recommended maintenance" that the vehicle did not need.  I still don't know how to resolve this. They did nothing to help resolve the situation other than offering a refund and blaming the machines.< /review>

Today i got a toyota tocoma from this dealer ship.
We dealt about this car and when i signed the paperworks  and they ran my credit, they increased  this car payment whichever my credit score was 718. It wasn’t any other way to leave this dealership because they already run my credit.
When i started to complain to their manger, he impolitely and rudely said, you can leave the dealership, its what it is.
The other problem was in their financial office,which all printers were out of order and my friend and me   Were there 4 hours.
I had two others Toyota from Marina Del Ray dealership ,I had no issue with that dealership and they were very honest.</Review>

<Review>Used Prius was clean and prepare repositioned near the lobby before our appointment.  The sales representative was polite and very good at explaining the dash controls and functions.  I priced a lot of LA dealers and they were the best.  Would definitely recommend them...< /Review>< Resp>

<time>1612031236435</time><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I bought my car a year ago. Today while I was driving in rush hour, I received a call from someone in the finance department asking to renew my warranty. I told her I was frazzled and asked how long the conversation would take. The woman replied about 15 minutes, so I said that may be okay. She starts talking about down payments and financing the warranty and coverage, all things my tired brain couldn't process at the moment. She then proceeds to tell me that after I hang up the phone with her, the opportunity to renew my warranty would be gone. I had to make a decision about the life of my car within 10 minutes. What a way to strongarm someone during a tough year. After I call her out on such a move, she then hangs up. So now, I can't renew my warranty because of your unethical tactics. My next car will not be with Culver City Toyota.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>Nice staff. Prat, Gary and Nery make sure you are happy with everything. They are NOT pushy like other dealers and they really try to get you a good Deal. Of course sometimes it's not exactly what you want but they get it as close and possible.  Try to keep a good credit score because it comes in handy.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1546289323750, 'text': 'Hello Moolian  Thank you for your 5 star review it was our pleasure to assist you with you vehicle needs.

workers stayed past midnight to make sure everything went through fine. Dedicated and polite. Finance worker didn’t spend hours trying to convince me that I was making a horrible decision by not opting for all of the add-on plans (that may have been due to the time, though, and there was an attempt). My first car buying experience, and I was pretty satisfied.</text>

I came to this dealership, thinking I was going to do business and buy a car for my family. Instead, I was treated as a toy, being played with by the employees. I went in the first day to check out a car and was introduced to Mo, a salesperson, who instead of being helpful about what I wanted in a car, kept on telling me why I wanted that feature and this feature and instead of helping me find cars that had the things I wanted. Being very annoyed and irritated, I went  back to give them another chance at helping me find a car. This time I got another guy named Arturo. We saw a car and I liked it and initially the guy was very helpful and we came to negotiations and we got as far as the price of the car out the door and it got too late so I left and came back the second day to discuss interest rates. The third day, I came bright and early like previous days and we sat down and came to agreements on interest rates as well and by then it was already evening. At the last second when I was about to take out cash and credit cards, Arturo tells me let me go check if the car has been sold. I didn't know how to react to this, I mean have I been negotiating a car that the salesperson doesn't even know if its available at the time of our negotiations. Anyways, he comes back and tells me the car is sold. I was mad, as anyone who spent 3 whole days trying to do business and get a car from the same dealership would. I asked to speak to a manager, Steve, when I was told, that they were doing two negotiations at the same time on the same car and the other people happened to beat me in giving cash and credit cards. How ridiculous is that? Buying a car shouldn't be a race. I was very much disappointed and felt humiliated. I asked for the copies of my id and registration they had made back and they refused so I said I'm going to call the cops when Steve, the manager, said go ahead we donate to Culver City Police. I got really scared because he just had threatened me by saying that the law couldn't help me because his company donated to the Police. Anyways, I left and I'm telling everyone in my family and friend group to never come to this dealership, unless they want to be treated as a toy and get harassed and embarrassed, and waste their time.< /Text>< Pics>

!!!Attention future customers better don't go there!!!

I am a returning customer to this dealership. I bought a Toyota Prius Prime from about 10 months ago, and I was extremely happy and pleased with the service but when I came back (with a friend of mine) yesterday after receiving an response email on my inquiry earlier to buy an Avalon 2019 and I was told by salesman to go to the roof to look at inventory. We went with him, and after 25 minutes walking he couldn't find the car, and he figured that the car is placed in another facility. He stated that he will need 20 minutes to bring the car, and I informed him that we will go to Honda while he is looking into the location of the Avalon as this is the car I want to buy.

After 10-15 min the sales rep called and said that he doesn't want the bring the car because we are already in Honda and probably the Avalon will not meet my expectations. He said that its probably too expensive for me anyway. I called the manager on duty, and I asked why he wouldn't bring the car - he said that the lot is too far (storage 405) and its going to take him long to bring it now. After I hanged up and went back to the dealership the sales rep said that he had a feeling that we weren't going to buy the vehicle even if he brings it, so there is no point of him to inconvenience himself as he wasn't going to make profit anyway. He said that if he was the owner, he wouldn't even bother talking to us. That was witnessed by manager Ronny on duty who did not take any action.

I understand you might have enough business and you can afford to treat clients badly but this cannot be the way that business is conducted in the middle of Culver City. At the end of the day, I am trying to spend $50k, and I think I at least should get normal customer service.< /Review>

<review>Friendly people, our salesman Arthur was quite helpful. There was a LONG WAIT for financing meetings since the crowd was huge for Memorial Day weekend, and they got Subway sandwiches, chips, and water for everyone who was stuck there waiting, which was lovely. The dealership is recently remodeled and very nice and clean. They have a wonderful free coffee machine that made a great vanilla latte. We were there about seven hours total due to the wait for financing, which was almost insanity-inducing (for us and the staff working so long without breaks to get us all processed, still with smiles on their faces, amazingly), but they made it as pleasant as possible.  Don’t go Memorial Day weekend unless you must for a specific deal!! Otherwise I’d recommend this dealership for sure.< /review>< Rate>

I bought a car here, everyone was nice enough, but I was looking for a more special experience, I just dropped a band on a new whip and no one was like happy for me or like enjoying my enjoyment. I left feeling like maybe I’ll just return it and buy elsewhere. Coulda been cheaper/better value.< /Review>

Went in to have routine maintenance and had some other issues. Warranty covered everything and car was done in 24 hours. They gave me a rental to use while it was being fixed. Maintenance rep was professional and helpful. Will be back next time car is due for service.</Text>

< review>
I recently purchased a car from Culver City Toyota. I'm a young woman and this was my first car purchase. The reason I had such a wonderful experience was due to Gary Morales. He was so patient and wonderful with me. We looked at two cars the first day and I left after several hours. He had an incredible attitude even though he had worked so many hours with me and I hadn't decided on a vehicle. He then contacted me the next day with more cars he thought I may like. Two days later I called him said I was interested in a vehicle and he came in on his DAY OFF to help me! Again, he sat with me for hours explaining the process and making me feel comfortable. If you go to Culver City Toyota do yourself a favor and ask for Gary Morales. I worked with other dealerships and other people and I was unimpressed, but Gary was awesome! He even gave me a slice of pizza since we were there for so long. Thank you Gary! I really appreciate your time and patience with me and I'm very happy with my new Corolla!</review>

<Text>went to get an oil change, picked up my vehicle and noticed a GIANT crack on my windshield along with cracks on my bumper which all happened 12-11-17. its been 5 business days and ive been driving around with this huge crack which is a hazard. spoke with operation manager-george, he reviewed the cameras and said they will order a windshield by 12-17-18. the whole time in between it was a giant headache trying to reach someone to resolve the issues. last i heard from george was on 12-13-18. ive been leaving voicemails for the past 3 business days and no one returned my call nor scheduled anything to fix my windshield. on top of that i told him i live in buena park and to drive all the way to culver city for their incompetence is ridiculous. so i tried to call him to arrange other agreements but like i said, its been 3 days since ive been non stop calling and leaving voicemails and still havent heard nothing yet. these damages are only the ones i am aware of thats visible, who knows what else they may have damaged as i dont understand how a cracked windshield can happen from getting an oil change!.

***update*** it is now jan 4th and I still haven't heard anything from this dealership even though they admitted fault. I even emailed monique the day of when she replied to this review and she ddint even respond. I dont know what kind of sick games their playing. I reported you guys to bbb so I hope to hear something this way. Next step is small claims with this joke of a business.<//Text>< Pics>

To say I'm disappointed about my experience with Culver City Toyota's Service Center (as well as Marina Del Rey's Toyota Service Center) would be a gross understatement. Since I first purchased my Corolla, I have solely taken it for scheduled maintenance to a certified Toyota dealership service center (rather than an outside mechanic) because they "ensure the quality and dependability you trust," as Toyota describes on its own website. Unfortunately, I've discovered that this is far from reality and I would have been better served finding an honest mechanic.

Culver City Toyota installed new brake pads and resurfaced the rotors at roughly 60k miles. The entire experience was horrible — as I was waiting in my car for nearly 30 minutes while being ignored by all service attendants, and ultimately had to go inside to find someone to assist me with my scheduled appointment.

After that horrible experience at Culver City Toyota, I decided to go to Marina Del Rey Toyota for an airbag recall at 66k miles and during the visit, it underwent a "multi-point inspection" but there was no mention of any concern with the brake pads or rotors (nor would I expect any issues with new brakes after only 6k miles). However, during my most recent service at 73k miles, I was told that the brake pads were fully worn and the rotors were completely warped, and quoted at $500+ for the repair.

When I made my technician aware that those brake pads were installed only 13,000 miles prior, he told me flatly that the repair was done at Culver City Toyota and thus, I should follow up with them. Essentially,  Toyota offered zero accountability, ownership, or even basic empathy for my situation. In their words, they told me to go back to Culver City Toyota and "see if they will cut you a deal."

After doing some research, I discovered that Toyota brake pads should last on average 30,000-60,000 miles. Therefore, the only explanation for brand new Brake Pads being completely worn after 13,000 miles is 1) the initial brake service at Culver City Toyota was improperly/poorly performed, and 2) Marina Del Rey Toyota failed to notify me that there was concern with the brakes during subsequent service visits.

If you've made it to this point in my review, you may simply believe that I am just a negligent car owner who likely drives the vehicle in irresponsible way, and the entire situation is my fault. While I will admit that I should have been more diligent with agreeing to the Basic Service package without more information, I can assure you that I drive with extreme care, especially when it comes to braking. There is absolutely NO WAY brand new brake pads were worn down after only 13,000 miles because of heavy braking in this instance.

WORD OF ADVICE 1: Toyota owners should be made aware that these service centers are all independently owned and managed. Despite Toyota's advertising to the contrary, your quality of service can vary wildly from dealership to dealership and there seems to be no set of standards beyond using certified Toyota Parts.

That means that if you have an issue with your experience at one of these centers and you contact Toyota, they will disavow all responsibility and simply point to this fact. They take zero ownership over the quality of service at these centers which all proudly bear the Toyota name. It's not worth the extra money. Find an honest, quality mechanic instead.<//review>

From when I first walked on the dealership floor, Miguel was a fantastic salesman who was chill, honest, and knowledgable. Throughout the process I felt like he was being straightforward with me and worked to find an arrangement where I could walk out happy with my purchase.

The dealership itself was nice and had a great inventory of vehicles as well as very convenient opportunities to test drive and ask questions. The service department was efficient and nice, with free shuttle and Uber service.

Overall I walked into the experience being extremely skeptical of having to interact with what seemed like it would be a pushy dealership, and thanks to Miguel and the service department I found that to mostly not be the case. There are other folks there who seemed like they took a more transparently aggressive sales approach and are the closers for the deal you work out but I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't all like that.

I look forward to my continued purchase experience with Culver City Toyota.</Text>

You give them your hard earned money, your service, and they cannot get you what you are owed.

<rating>1< /rating><Text>I have bought/financed 4 cars from them. The first two were effortless and great deals.recently,  I received a call from one of the managers telling me to give him 5 minutes for him to tell me how to get a better deal in one of my cars. The deal seemed legit and offered me 0.9 % in my second car. They also cancelled my extended warranty and assured me I would be refunded enough money to put down $1300 from my refund towards the purchase of my two new cars. They needed a check just for hold. After 3 weeks the person in finance (David)never returned my calls regarding my refund, instead the dealer deposited my "hold only" check and this caused my account to go super over drafted and with multiple fees. I came to the dealer and they assured me ( again) that they would cut me a check .... Then what? The person authorized to sign went home early, come back tomorrow .... Tomorrow is today.... I am still waiting .... I guess you never earn trust back. Culver city Toyota used to be plain and simple and did me good, but this time around they have disappointed me. I just want this to be over with and NEVER give them my business . I really encourage you to stay away from them. May be its just me, but I would not like anyone else go through this. A customer doesn't stop being a customer when he drives off with a new car, it is your customer until all his needs are satisfied. Far from my experience here.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2b980b3314815:0xec119ffd24caaf09<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Called ahead with an appointment time, but when I arrived they said I would need to leave the car overnight since they are so backed up.  Would have been nice if they were more proactive and let me know the actual time frame of the service I needed and if it was a good time to swing by for a timely service check. Setting expectations and being upfront are good qualities of customer service, and I felt this service center was lacking that on this particular day.<//review>< pics>

I would highly recommend to all my friends and family who are looking for a reliable vehicle at a great rate. I had previously worked with Gianni and Marco were extremely helpful and patient. Their sales managers also came by and broke down all of the possible options which I greatly appreciated.  They presented multiple options and helped me find the best deal for the budget. Their sales team is excellent and like their slogan they do make it easy.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1531762885860, 'text': 'Hello Nivia Thank you for your 5 star review'}</response>< gmapID>

I asked for him and the some nice salesman did his best to get someone to help us but that person didn't want to help us he said he was going home. Then the person  they handed us over to said he wanted to go home to watch his basketball game. So he played the part that he was going to have great deals on Black Friday . When the day came they had the same deals as of the Wednesday we had gone. This dealer lies to you and is not dedicated to helping customers.<//Review><resp>{'time': 1511904588851, 'text': 'Javier, we’re sorry to hear about your experience with our dealership and our sales staff.

My experience was great! I had great communication with Manuel and Sebastian. They worked with me and I would like to think that we all benefitted. They were great at communicating with me, being patient, and providing me the information I needed and requested.  The car buying process can be stressful, but they made it feel easy and seamless.  Would definitely recommend this dealership to others!</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>Came here to purchase a used 2018 Prius Four listed. Contacted them as soon as I saw it online. Had very limited pictures on what the car looks like which was totally understandable since according to them they just got the car in. The internet sales manager told me they're prepping the car so it will not be available to see until that Thursday so I went there on that day to look at it. Got there and was passed to another salesman since the internet manager was busy with someone else. Ok...not a good start right there but was thinking as long as the pricing is right, don't really care. Sat down with the new guy, talked about pricing, also briefly talked about a new one and see if they can match a competitive quote I got from another dealer. They weren't able to match the quote so we began to negotiate on pricing for the used Prius Four I came here to see. A little to my surprise, the car wasn't available since they're still prepping the vehicle. Ok,since the car is not there, let's talk about pricing. The price I offered was aggressive but not unreasonable so, considering Toyota have rebate on the 2019 and the very competitive quote I got from another dealer so a used 2018 Prius wasn't really that far off from a 2019 similar trim. Once my price was offered, we do the usual song and dance with not so straight up dealership, multiple times of going back to the "manager" to negotiate on pricing couple with bringing out another guy which I presume is the manager that fit your stereotypical used car salesman image...cheap suit with a  bling out Gold Rolex...etc to negotiate on pricing. I love how they try to tell me how they price their car at 2% margin and in order to make up for it, they require the customer to buy PERMASHIELD and GPS tracking device so the dealer can make money. As if somehow I should care that they are making good money of my purchase, interestingly this is the same tactic used by West Coast Toyota, to which they will tell you it's something they can't take off and will then try to sell it to you at "cost" which is probably still 80-90% margin for them. Anyway, I told them here's the price I am looking at and I don't want those two BS options to change the price. After more painful back and fourth to which the manager have to check with the used car manager  we came to an agreement with the price and I thought deal done. Man, was I wrong..I guess my first mistake was agreeing to the purchase trusting them without actually seeing the car yet because this is how they almost got away with the bait and switch if I didn't do more research afterward.

Apparently even though they advertised the vehicle as a PRIUS FOUR, the reason they were able to agree to my offer was because the entire time they were actually selling a PRIUS TWO instead of FOUR. My offer price was way higher than what a TWO was going for hence I see why they agree to take off PERMASHEILD and GPS tracking and pretended they gave me an excellent deal. For any consumers less savvy and easy to prey on they probably wouldn't be able to tell a FOUR from a TWO but one look at the interior and you can tell the difference. This is where they thought they were able to get away with it since they didn't post any of the interior pictures so I wasn't able to tell. However, trusting my gut feeling, I ran a VIN check afterward when I got home and immediately discovered the TWO trim instead of FOUR, luckily for me I haven't yet taken delivery of the vehicle so I called them the next day to cancel the entire transaction.  One vin check and it tells you right away what trim level it is so I am not buying that excuse. In fact if you go online, many dealers will try to pass off a TWO or THREE as FOUR but one look at the interior (bigger navi screen, seating surface..etc) and you can tell it's not a FOUR.

Long story short these people will try to take advantage of you, just go somewhere else, there are better dealers out there.</text></record>

I had a great experience with Karen. Not giving 5 stars because it was difficult to reach her or the gentleman assisting her by telephone when I had questions. When I stopped in, another person had to help me. They were busy but apologetic and friendly. I ultimately used the  Costco program because I don’t like to haggle. Overall, I am very happy with my car and the service I received. Karen was wonderful on the day I finally leased my car. She was patient, informative and helpful.<//review>

Everybody was so nice, welcoming and helpful. What I loved the most about this experience was the fact that we didn’t feel pushed to buy, but felt comfortable knowing that the guys were there ready to help. They gave us the space to discuss our concerns and for us that was very important. Thomas took the time to help us find what we were looking for and very patiently stood by our side to answer every question. Matt was very attentive and informative, helped us through the process and went a little more into detail. The Manager was amazing and I want to say thank you for making my dad’s Christmas gift happen, I just don’t remember your name, but a million thanks!!!! We felt very good about the choice we made. Happy Holidays to the whole Culver City Toyota team and many blessings!!!!<//Review>

Last Saturday I went to discuss options with TOYOTA Culver City as I had spoken to other Dealerships about Buying Out my car from a Lease!
I have to say dispite the Renovations in progress I was given very attentive & informative attention from Moise in Sales & Gianni in Finance !
These transactions can take time & not being the most patient person, these  2 guys made it as painless as possible including some generous Deals !
I have to say I am very happy with the final result & encourage anyone with a Toyota Lease & considering a Buy Out to speak to Moise & Gianni at the Culver City dealership !
Thank you Guys & all the Staff !</Text>

Our experience with Toyota Culver City started out bad, our first sales consultant would not work with us in any way to accommodate pricing. We were close to either going to another dealer or brand but we decided to go back in the front lobby and speak to another sales consultant. Christian Z. saved us from going to another dealer and listened to what we wanted and worked with us the best way he could. He made our second car buying experience feel like it was the first. Smooth and easy. Because of him, we were able to walk out that same day with a new car. Christian saved the sale and deserves all the credit for his professionalism and his way of working with us. Give that man a raise.< /review>

<Review>I was charged $165 for them to pull a simple engine code (P0A80) from my Prius and tell me the hybrid battery failed. They told me to do this they had to use special $20,000 equipment and use 60-90 minutes of labour. I think they were lying and trying to rip me off over a simple error code. Also they said they would give me results from the multiple battery tests performed and all they gave was the single code.

I got this same code by e-mail later from my insurer's ODB device (MetroMile). Complete waste of money and going elsewhere for an OEM battery replacement. That mechanic pulled the code easily in a few minutes.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Service reps are genial and mostly competent.  Quicker turnaround than most other Toyota service depts in LA.  Renovated guest area is a big improvement over the previous dark, sad cave, but for the oppressive Muzak screaming early 2000s misery (Linkin Park, Enrique Igesias, really?) plus the multiple TVs playing a full blast .  My thought is that the escalating cacophony of upsetting "music" and Fox News/ESPN is meant to subdue customers who are stuck waiting for their cars?   Or maybe an apt soundtrack for the weird/seemingly lost and aimless sales folks who roam around the lobby area bickering with one another and sipping the free coffee.<//review>

Great experience with Scott Tojo. Always thinks of customer first. Finance Specialist Gianni Valencia was great also. He explained everything and took the time to go over all the paperwork. Highly recommend them both.< /Review>

Worst Experience, Avoid this place. I wanted to give it a NEGATIVE star but it's not an option.
My wife took my 2016 Tacoma for service and also to have them check the vibration when braking over 60 mph. I barely drive my truck. It has over 26,000 miles and I bought it back in late 2015. First, Charles Soetan told my wife that one brake pad was bad and needed to be replaced. That did not make sense so I asked my wife to put him on the phone. Charles told me that the two front pads needed to be replaced. I told him how could that be possible that I needed to replace the pads at 26,000 miles that is too soon. He said it was normal. I asked to talk to a supervisor and he told me he was the supervisor which it was a lie. His business card says"Service Advisor". It took me 45 minutes to talk to the Service Director by the name of George Boktor. George told my wife that Toyota doesn't makes good brake pads for Toyota Tacoma and Prius anymore and that it was normal to go bad after 20,000 miles. When I got on the phone he told me that I need it to replace the rotors because they are not good. I know for a fact that Toyota makes really good durable and reliable cars, that's what I've driven my whole life. I just don't understand how a Service Director says that Toyota don't make good brake pads anymore. That's the reason why I would not recommend anyone to use Toyota Culver City for your Toyota service.</Text>

<Review>WORST DEALERSHIP EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!
DON'T GET RIPPED OFF TOO!!!!!
I was charged for a $700 repair that was covered under my warranty despite asking Roger in Service several times to check my warranty. He told me the repair was not covered and charged me. The next day I called Toyota Care to check if the repair was covered under my warranty and sure enough, just like I thought, the repair was under warranty and I'm owed a refund. I was told three weeks ago by Pepe that I would get a refund check in the mail. Nothing arrived and after three weeks I called both George and Pepe in Service to find out where my check is and they tell me they will look into it and call me. I have yet to receive a call back or a check. Their service department is an absolute joke. No one should have to deal with this. Go to any other dealership or risk being ripped off even worse than you would have expected from a dealership.< /Review>< resp>

< Review>
I've had a bad experience here before... this time I went it was so so. I arrived at toyota after two hours of leaving my car for routine maintenance.  My representative was nowhere to be found. I went to 3, no excuse me 4 different reps before i was actually helped. Each one just kept sending me to the next, I was only trying to find out how much longer my car would be. No one wanted to look on the computer,  even though I kept saying just wanna know how much longer it will be, they just kept saying your rep might be over there. Go here, go there. Just find him outside.... um ok. Not helpful. After the third person I was like just tell me about my car. I dont care where my rep is. I was clearly annoyed, so finally someone helped me. I was told my car had been ready for 10 minutes and I should have received a call.... I never did. I'd been waiting and got tried of waiting. Anyway... like I said I've had a bad experience before when I was told something had been done and it wasnt. I was hoping my experience would be a little less disappointing,  it wasnt.<//Review>

My experience at Miller Toyota is the best I’ve had with any dealer in Southern California! The main reason was my salesperson, Laura Ballard!!!! Laura was without a doubt the most professional and sincere salesperson I have ever worked with! Laura is warm and honest and truly cares about the customer. She offered me a great deal that I couldn’t turn down and throughout the entire process I felt no pressure, just a warm helpful guide. Before I drove off in my new car I told Laura, “It was such joy working with you and I am so happy to have made a deal with such a nice person, you are the best!”.<//Text>

We had an appointment on Saturday, when we got there I was told that it would take 4 hours for and oil change. I made another appointment for Thursday, when we got there I was told by one of the representative to sit in my car till a rep came to my car (I was the only person waiting), finally a rep came took my info and waited for 2 hours for an oil change. The car came out, I got tire of waiting for them to call me and asked for my paperwork, at that moment the rep said the car had just come out but my car had been out for 20 min.  On our way home we notice the car sounded different, when we open the hood the air filter chamber was open. I was used to getting good customer service at this dealership but on the last two appointments that has changed .</text>

Did not like the experience of purchasing a car with them, as a previous consumer said they treat you like numbers and after you purchase they don't want to deal with you! They gave me a wrong price on a Toyota, did not receive a set while on the sticker says it does have included, did not attach some things important for the car before i left,and when i went back they didn't want to deal with me. I am in process on taking legal actions.</text>

<text>My recent car purchase at Culver City Toyota has been the best car buying experience to date. The sales person, Ali Farhat, was no nonsense and very friendly. I established up front what I wanted and he told me early on what he could do which made the process fast and hassle free. His sales manager (I unfortunately didn't get the name) and finance team were equally nice and helped seal the deal I was looking for. Completing the final paperwork with Prat rounded out the total experience as amazing. He threw in some extras that I was very pleased with. Everyone had a great disposition beginning to end. Plus, my car (used 2016 Dodge Caravan) was in amazing condition which made me feel good about the quality of their used cars. I recommend giving Culver City Toyota a chance if you're looking to buy a vehicle.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I purchased my first car with Carolina Gutierrez. My experience with her was great. She made every step easy. We went over a few of my options over the phone. And once i came in she already had the vehicle ready to test drive. The process was pretty quick. Finance took about thirty minutes. Once i came out, the vehicle was ready for delivery. If you are ready to purchase a car make sure to see Carol, she will take care of you.</review>

I took my time with deciding which car to purchase. Gary Morales never rushed me or pressured me. We test drove a few cars over the course of a couple of weeks. Once I knew which car to buy, I came back prepared. He offered me less money down than any other dealership for the same monthly car note. My car was delivered from another dealership (because I wanted a color they didn’t have) and when it arrived, it was washed and prepared for me while I signed all of my documents with Collins in finance. Overall, I look forward to driving my 2019 Toyota CHR for the next 3 years (because I leased it) and when my time is up, the guys at Culver City Toyota will have my back when I need to choose the next car.</text>

I just want to say that I have been a loyal Honda client for over a decade.  After my experience with Brandon and his assistant Christine you have made me a Toyota customer for life.  This is how the car buying experience should be.  They treated me with honesty and integrity and not like your typical salesman.  They gave me very personalized service and made the whole car buying experience amazing.  If it wasn't for them along with your amazing finance manager Pratt I would not be here today.  Take care of them because this is what makes your dealership great. My family absolutely loves our new Highlander and I will refer clients of mine to this team and to this dealership.  Thank you!< /text>

They are very creative to look at your budget and  work on your best interest. I really enjoyed working with all the people who were involved to find me the right car. I have been with Toyota for 20 years and I feel very safe and secure driving their car. I want both my kids to continue stay with Toyota.
Thank you Culver City Toyota for taking care of your customer.

I went there to get a new Toyota. Upon arrival, I was kept waiting for 15-20 minutes before being able to speak with a salesperson. Everyone was very polite. When Avelino, who I was supposed to see, arrived, he took over the whole process and became my personal representative. He had a car waiting and took me for a test drive, then, when I asked to see a different car, obtained that one.
I ultimately got the first one.
My only real complaint was that the whole process took a very long time, but I was ultimately satisfied.< /review>

EDIT 4/13/13: came back here last month and got a Camry for a family member. Boy o boy is this place amazing! Their deals are so good that the transaction took forever because there were more customers than salesmen!
But of course, they had a deal that no other place could match and we walked away with another beautiful car for a family member!

Loui the manager is unresponsive.  This guy gives this place a bad name.  This guy should be fired for being a careless manager.  Customer service and satisfaction is not on his radar.  This guy works here just for the money.  If he had any respect for customers he would have the courtesy to respond to calls or answer his phone.   Never answers and never responds to customers.  Just a terrible Toyota service manager.   Two thumbs down.< /text>

<review>Got a good deal on a car and everyone was very nice. However, we felt a little blindsided by the theft patrol on the car, which was a $900+ pre-installed add-on. It wasn’t included in the list price, so it felt pretty shady. Financing took forever (and I think that’s probbaly normal) and we didn’t appreciate the hard sell on maintenance coverages. We ended up coming to a compromise that I think will end up being beneficial to us, but it’s hard to say. Overall decent experience but I don’t know if we’ll be back for our next car.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Our salesman worked so we could drive off in the Prius we sought. He met our terms as closely as possible with little of the hassle associated with purchasing a vehicle. Big thanks to Gianni for his help.</Review>

Service for my oil change was good and the shuttle was effective.  My service rep was excellent.  My complaint is that the dealer used to provide a free car wash but stopped because of drought.   A solution is that they should give us a voucher at a car wash station.  They do that at Bob Baker Toyota in Lemon Grove and it works just fine.  You should do it here as well.</text>

Don’t go to this dealership if you’re young. My fiancé and I went in and were treated like jokes. Age doesn’t define money but apparently to these people they think it does. After being asked inappropriate questions about our relationship status and making me feel uncomfortable we still wanted to look at a Tacoma that we went there for in the first place. After much debate on an affordable lease we  signed for a brand new 2019 Toyota Tacoma. The lease paperwork stated the truck had 10 miles on it. We didn’t leave the dealership until about 11:30pm that night so I know they wanted us out of there. When getting in the truck it had over 30 miles on it. When receiving the keys they said they will not be giving us the remote key and they will send it in the mail. We should have walked off the lot with all of the keys we PAID for. We left with only the spare key with no remote on it since they gave us no other option. A month later, still no key. We are now THEEE months later and NO KEYS. And mind you we live about 80 miles from this dealership, so unless we get compensation for miles I should not have to drive down there to speak to someone. We have tried to contact our sales rep 10 times and left MULTIPLE voicemails... no return call. Called the sales manager MULTIPLE times and left MULTIPLE voicemails... no return call. Spoke with the receptionist MULTIPLE times... NO RETURNED CALLS. I don’t understand how we have not received ANY type of customer service when we are paying customers! Wish we never would have went to this dealership and will NEVER get a car from this place again and will NEVER recommend anyone to go here unless you want horrid service. Can’t wait until our lease is up and can’t wait to walk away. Absolutely terrible dealership. Corporate is going to be called.<//Text>

It was very stree free, personal experience.  I was helping my ex-wife to purchase a Prius and she was running out of time for her appointment on her client.  Curver city Toyota delivered the car and the paper work for her to sign to her work place so that she can get back to her work schedule on time.  Moreover, we got by far the lowest prices from this dealer comparing deals through truecar.  Highly recommend.< /review>

<text>I went in to check out the Sienna and Marco helped my wife and I and he was very nice and .Helped us fill out paperwork for the car but was told the usual down payment was 14,000 went is ridiculous!! The manager Sebastian personally told us he would contact us to let us know the status of our application. Until this day I haven't heard back from them and it's been 3 weeks!! Very disappointed especially because they kept saying they treat you like family!! I wouldn't recommend this location!!< /text><userid>116511093066379037231<//userid>< date>

I enjoy my experience here. They were fast, professional, and friendly, with absolutely no hassle. I had been to others retail Toyota dealers and they can not be comparable to this one in Culver City. If only google plus had more stars, I would have gave this place a 10 stars.</Review>

This used to be the most honest fair service department around. But the last few years and it’s gone in the dumpster. I had to wait in line behind others who had major problems with them as well. Several other local Toyota dealerships do not treat their customers so badly. The owners can run it into the ground if they want, but they are putting a huge black eye on the Toyota name.</Text>

<Review>So they have a really good deal at this place. 3 synthetic oil changes for $119. But you have to use them within a year and a half.

I have a camera in my car. it doesn't work once they turn off the engine. But they worked on my car for a full 8 minutes. Which is shocking considering they changed my oil and rotated the tires. also in that 8 minutes they discovered six or seven things that were wrong with my car that needed to be taken care of immediately.  Maybe they are that good.

The list.

front brake job 3 mm left,
rear brake job soon for mmm, lower control arm bushings are cracking,
rack and pinion leaking with alignment,
t belt water pump and seals do to mileage,
drive belts have cracked,
bone Mount cracking.

I took my car to piochski automotive. And to  my friend John.  To check the list.

the brakes definitely needed to be changed he said so I changed the brakes. I'm glad I took it in for the oil change and they mentioned the brakes as long as they were that thin that they needed to be changed immediately.

I also got a coupon at the bottom of the receipt for a full interior and exterior detail for $69.  I'm using that today. We'll see how it goes.

The oil change deal is just a deal to get you in there so they can make money.

And if you're not careful they will make a lot of money off you. So keep that in mind< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b980b3314815:0xec119ffd24caaf09</gmap_id><response>{'time': 1548184858387, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback about my dealership’s service department.

He did not provide too little or too much communication.  When I visited the dealership he provided just the right amount of personal service.  I felt like I had a 'concierge' - a person who was in tune with my needs.  After I agreed to the sale, Kai delivered the vehicle to me one hour away from the dealership.

<Text>Saw 2 employees drive a car to Starbucks to get coffee in what appeared to be a customer's car. The car was a white Prius with some damage on the passenger's side front bumper and the #809 service cone that is placed on top of vehicles when taken in for service. That's the reason I assume it's a customer's car. I understand cars need to be test driven after repairs but not to run personal errands. Just thought this was wrong.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

My experience at Culver City Toyota was better than I could ever imagine. As a first time buyer, I was very nervous and stressed about the whole situation for months. Culver City Toyota was the first and last dealership I had to go to. Sebastian from Sales and their Floor Manager was AMAZING! But my experience with the Financial team member with Pratt was the best! He made he feel comfortable with the whole process and answered all my questions! Needless to say, I will be returning to Culver City Toyota for future car needs!</Text>

Craig Hayden was of great help! He made the process easy and useful to understand when leasing. Within a matter of a couple of hours, I was able to pick a car and come home with a new Toyota CHR!< /Review>

I loved my experience there! Carol Gutierrez, who helped me get my Corolla was very helpful and made my experience here a unique one. She was very courteous and knowledgeable which made my decision of which car to get a no brainer. She did not sell me the product, but let the product speak for itself by showing me the car and its features. Will definitely go back once my lease is over.<//Review>

My family recently bought a Toyota Sienna using the Costco car-buying program.  The Costco team put us in touch with Elaine Sanchez at Culver City Honda, since that dealership was closest to our home.  We had spent hours researching pricing and options, and by the time we got to Culver City Honda we were in our final stages of purchase.  Elaine was professional in all manners of communication with us including phone, email and in person.  She is exceptionally knowledgeable and a very sharp sales person, always answering our questions honestly (we did our homework!).  She was able to offer the pricing that met our budget, and made the whole process seamless.  Although other Toyota dealers in the area came close to her pricing, it was Elaine’s customer service that won us over.  We appreciated her promptness, her professionalism, and her respect of our needs.  I would give her 6 stars if I could.  She went above and beyond to make our car-buying experience a happy and satisfying one.</text>

<review>My husband and I came in May 30, 2019 to purchase a new car using the Toyota Motor Sales Employee family certificate (ability to purchase the car at invoice cost).

6 pm: We arrived. Since this was our second time at the dealership, we already knew which car we wanted to purchase. We immediately found a sales associate who could help us purchase it. I handed him the certificate and made sure to also verbally tell him we were using the certificate, how it worked and where the directions were.

7:30 pm: After making us waiting an HOUR AND A HALF our sales associate brought out pricing based on the STICKER PRICE. After we explained how the certificate works a second time, the sales associates said that he had no idea about this program and didn’t understand.  We explained it again and again showed him the directions that were printed on the certificate itself. He then disappeared again.

8:30 pm: The sales associate finally presented us with the invoice. Finally!!

9:30 pm: We were finally seen by the finance department (We didn’t even need financing with them since he had check in hand.) Cecilia was the only bright point in the entire night because she was so very helpful and extremely respectful of our time.

11:00 pm: 5 HOURS later, we finally received the car.

Overall, my husband and I were appalled at the service we received. My mom, who is a retired Toyota employee, had told us how easy the process is especially since all the dealership has to do is pull the invoice. No haggling...no bargaining.... no running numbers. The price is already set. Unfortunately, this was the not our experience.

If we could have bought a car anywhere else, we would have walked away and done so. But unfortunately, Culver City Toyota was the only dealership in all of the Los Angeles county that had the car we wanted. We left your dealership feeling like you were making us wait because we were using the TMS Certificate and you had to sell us a car at dealer cost. You wasted our time and your own.  We will never recommend your dealership to anyone ever nor will we ever step foot there again.

***We had filled out the survey and privately contacted the dealer concerning our experience.  It went unanswered and we were never contacted.  We wanted to share our experience with others in the hopes that they can avoid what we experienced.

****41 days later, we just discovered that Culver City Toyota never sent the check to Chase to pay off the loan on the car we traded in.  So, my husband and I are still financially responsible for the car Culver City Toyota purchased from us until they finish the process.  We have also yet to receive our license plates....<//review><username>Robin Limoges Walowski< /username>< pics>

I would give Culver City Toyota negative stars if I could. After I purchased my car I have had an atrocious experience with them. After being blatantly lied to by the Finance Manager I tried contacting him over a dozen times with no response. I went to corporate and had them submit complaints for the issues I had; however, the customer relations manager will not reach out as was requested by Toyota. I HIGHLY recommend people shop at another Toyota dealership as this one is filled with dishonest people.</review>

<username>Megan Strickland<//username><review>Having car work always takes more money and time than you'd like, but the folks at Miller made it as painless as possible. I was able to get an appointment right away, and even though they found a few other things that needed to be repaired urgently they still had me on my way within a few hours. They would have given me a ride somewhere, but I chose to walk around the nearby stores and sit in the customer lounge. I really appreciated that there are two sections of the lounge and that one of them had the television OFF, though it did smell of car exhaust (which is to be expected since it is attached to the garage). They even washed the car for free, which was just the thing I needed to get the rest of my day looking up. I'm just visiting the area so I probably won't have the opportunity to go back, but if I lived around here I definitely would.< /review>< user_id>

<Text>This is normally a 31/2 star dealership. They are competent but greedy. They have a no checks policy. My wife who has been spending thousands in service exclusively at this dealer over the lifetime of her 2013 Prius misplaced her Visa card. They refused to accept her check for $130.00 Alignment. Of course they recommended an additional $800 in work because "it was time". Complimentary oil change, refused to install the new wipers I bought he, and sent her packing in a complimentary Uber keeping her car telling her to come back when she had the $130.00 cash.
Most MODERN large scale businesses have electronic check cashing systems so you write a check which instantly debits the amount from your account. Spectrum, Verizon, Best Buy  have used this system for years. Even small businesses.
My wife returned the next day and paid the $130.00 !!!!!! for the wheel alignment but with her card.
On the way home she was hit by a 20 year old and her Prius was totaled. She was hurt but not severely but we are on our way to the ER today. All because a hugely successful dealership would not accept a check for $130 because they are to cheap and greedy to invest in an electronics check system. For a devoted customer.
I know what kind of people own Car Dealerships. I used to sell cars. The front end is sales the back end is parts and service. Most people think sales is where the big money is made. Sales is a way to get you and your new or used car to the back end where the big money is really made. The service writer, the parts counter and the mechanics all share a piece of the back end. The sales people do not. They are on commission or draw minimum wage at the end of the month if they can't sell a unit.
The sales staff wine  you and dine you then when it comes time "they have to talk to their manager" He is the closer, he will make the deal. This is referred to as a "turnover house"The F and I guy Finance and Insurance will will try to sell you extended warranties, insurance, paint protector etc. The F&I guy makes a percent on anything he can sell you ESPECIALLY financing, meaning the higher the percent of the loan you pay, the more of YOUR money he makes. Finance through your bank or credit union NEVER EVER through the dealer unless you have bad credit which they LOVE.
Good people work at this dealership and do good work but not the closer, the F and I guy and especially the bean counters and owner. They are the scum of the Earth. Check your wallet and glove box when you leave because it wii be substantially lighter or gone altogether.
The sole purpose of Toyota of Culver City is to take your money and keep you coming back. By the way Mrs. Smith while we were changing your oil we noticed you will soon need your major service and that will be $1500.00 and remember we don't take checks.</Text>< Gmap_id>

<time>1522951433431< /time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>We received assistance with our 2009 Lexus IS250 while in Los Angeles in early January 2018.  Randy Castellanos was the customer support representative that met us and helped coordinate the repairs we needed.  From the beginning of our interaction, throughout the duration of the repairs, Randy was communicative, responsive, and extremely helpful.  Randy went out of his way to help us including coordinating UBER transportation to our Flight leaving LAX and assisted our Son through retrieving the vehicle once the repairs were completed.  Randy returned every one of our calls or texts and provided outstanding coordination with our Aftermarket warranty provider.  Randy was the consummate professional and provided absolutely OUTSTANDING customer support through our entire experience.  We have purchased a maintenance plan with Culver City Toyota simply because of Randy's assistance and support.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>I would be exhausted if I told you every horrible thing that happened to me during my 3 year lease experience with them. And I paid all my payments early. Go somewhere else. HIGHLIGHTS: They lie to your face over and over. The financial dept. commits FRAUD. I filled out an signed less paperwork when I bought a home.  The sales people give you the run around, while lying and smiling because they are only interested in your money. The service dept. is a joke, and they constantly shuttle people to their homes without their keys and no way to get in and say to bad so sad. The so called "manager" was aware of this and that it had been going on for a long time, but was doing nothing to correct it. HEY!! HOW ABOUT STARTING WITH A SIGN (where we sit and wait for the shuttle) TO REMIND THE CUSTOMERS TO GET THEIR HOUSE KEYS!!!
They replace all employees it seems once a year or so or they all quit for good reason. I did speak with one employee bluntly,  and told this person that I will never deal with CULT-VER CITY TOYOTA ever again. This employee said they wouldn't either and told me a little more about this disgusting place.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My salesman's name was Tito, and I have to say I've never had a more pleasurable experience buying a new car.   I was given a fair price on my trade-in, a fair price on the new Camry I bought, and a very fair financing rate.

The process was smooth, and I was made to feel welcome and valued as a customer.  The finance manager, and dealership manager were also friendly and helpful.

Basically, if you're buying a new car go to Culver City TOYOTA!

Awful Service Department. Terrible customer service from the minute you drive in--or even call in.

Most Recent (of many) Examples: We were nearing our last scheduled oil change as part of buying car here... so I called to schedule an appointment. It was Sunday about noon and a recording picked up saying they were open Monday thru Sunday 7am to 9pm. Thought maybe someone not picking up. Called back few times and always got the message. Even had my wife listen to message, and she said "sounds like they should be open." Whatever. Finally left a VM saying "please call me to schedule appointment...and you should probably listen to your outgoing message because it's wrong"

Of course no one ever calls back. So Wednesday I call them, reach someone and make appointment for next day.

Arrive for appointment and say to guy checking me in at island we have our final oil change and are STILL having problems with our navigation/media system just going blank and not working until we turn car off and start it again--a problem we've had since a week after we got it. We've reported problem each time we've brought car in (about 4 times probably). Every time they say they'll look at it and then have no answer, or that they did an update that should fix it. It never has.  Guy checking me in just says if they check that it'll cost money because we are no longer under warranty. I say we've had this problem every time, don't you keep notes? He just repeats it's not under warranty.  Then he asks if my name is Denise--"No that's my wife, I'm Steve. She's working can you please call me when it's ready?" He says ok. Then as he takes keys he says, "call Denise?"... "No me, Steve" and I give him my number.

2hrs later after first calling my wife at work they call me. Woman on phone when I answer hello says, "Hi, Denise?"....haha. It's just so laughable. I say "no this is Steve I asked you to call me." She blames guy who checked me in for bad notes.

They say car ready, so I go in to get car and as this is our last visit and Toyota always sends questionnaire after, I decide to share my views with the Service Manager. That we will definitely not buy from them again because of the continued awful service, ignoring of complaints/problems with car, and lack of attention to detail...and that if it was anything more serious than the navigation system we'd consider this car a lemon.

They tell me the Service Manager has left for the weekend...it's 2pm but ok. The woman attendant asks what's wrong and I start to relay the series of problems stated above...she walks away as I'm talking to her...and comes back with the guy who checked me in and soon followed by someone who I guess was the assistant service manager (not sure why he wasn't called when I asked for Service Manager i.e. "He's on vacation but let me get you his assistant who IS here").

Anyway I explain all my problems since buying car and the service, and play them their own VM I recorded. The Asst Mgr says I called wrong number, that's sales hours. I play it again and it obviously says "Hello you've reached the Service Department we are open M-Sunday 7am-9pm." Perfect example of this place: Take no responsibility, Blame the customer and don't apologize even when proven wrong. I asked that the Service Manager call me when he returns from his weekend away---it's been a month and we've never heard from him.

DON'T buy from here and DON'T get your car serviced here. It's being run by people who don't know what they are doing.</Text>

Had a 7:30am oil change service appointment and I showed up 3 minutes late. Although there was a line of cars to get service as well... then came by Rosie :). Rosie, mentioned she noticed me coming in through the Honda Dealership lol. Whatever, she won my heart by saying this. This shows how much she is on it ;).

I asked Rosie about trading in my car. She provided me great detailed information. So will be keeping my my Camry in the meantime. She made the process exceptionally fast.

I drove far to this location but I don't mind coming here again. Have to say I LOVE TOYOTA.< /Text>

<Text>Before my foot hits the ground, getting out of my car, one of the salesmen hanging around out front (Home Depot style) is peppering me with questions. I say I'd just like to look around awhile. I do that, and when I find something in which I'm interested (door is locked, strangely - usually cars for sale at dealerships are open and you're welcome to take a look) no one will help me. The guy inside says I need  to talk to a guy outside, but apparently the guy outside tells that guy that I told him I wasn't interested, so I'm out of luck. Wow. Everything I loved about high school. Sorry I hurt your feelings, dude - guess I'll have to spend tens of thousands of dollars somewhere else.<//Text>< Pictures>

Wouldn't honor a coupon that expired 7 days ago even though I was about to spend a thousand dollars on maintenance. The purpose of a coupon is to get business to come in. We live in a busy city where time is hard to come by and it's the holiday season where money is always going to be tight. The fact that they'd be willing to lose business because of 7 days is frustrating. I'll be looking for a new place to service my car from now on.

What's worse, I had to change my 5 star review I left 3 years ago after buying the car from them to this 1 star review.<//Text>

<Text>My experience @ Culver City Toyota was exceptional!!! Kai was very helpful and HONEST!!!. We first discovered Culver City Toyota Online. We googled the car we wanted and Culver City had what we wanted Super White Toyota Camry XSE 2015. We called the dealership and  spoke with Kai. He told us he would meet our requirements and our BUDGET. We were skeptical about driving out there, being that we had bad experiences with different dealerships in past. When we arrived, he delivered what he had told us over the phone, hassle free!!! We would Definitely recommend Kai the go to person when purchasing a vehicle!!! :)< /Text>< pics>

Scam artists. Tried to charge me $300 more in the finance office, with a higher APR, than what we shook hands on in the showroom. When I called them on it, dude starts yelling at me. When I yell back, his manager starts puffing up his chest, starts walking in my space like he's going to throw down. Only go here if you're willing to risk being scammed and physically threatened.< /text>

I took my car for a brake service unfortunately a week after I have to brought back because the bakes needs adjustment, the worst part was the following week I have to take it back because the tire low pressure was turning on and off by itself just right after the adjustment, the two firsts times I have to wait more than 2 hours but the last time it was only 10 minutes waiting. I am giving 4 starts just because teddy the service representative , he is so kind and helpful. Before teddy another representative was helping me (randy) he is manager assistant but with him was the opposite, he was kind of rude also he did not give solution to my problem. If you planning to visit culver city Toyota for car service avoid randy.< /Review>

Gary the Salesperson was great and patient.  Great staff and very nice, clean dealership. My kids were comfortable while waiting for us to decide. I’ve told my family and friends, if they’re lookin into buying a car, this is the dealership!!!!

Follow up - 4/14/18
Even though I had good experience in Culver City Toyota the car I got was not what I expected. Got a RAV4, contacted Culver City Toyota to address my concerns and I only got a response saying that they got my message.  I haven’t heard from anybody to see what they can do about my problem. I guess when you’re buying a car they will treat you really special. Not when you have a problem. ☹️< /Review>

Micah Johnson is the best salesman hands down. He helped me get exactly what I wanted with excellent service. I'd give 10 stars for him if I was able to. If you're looking to get a new car from Toyota of Culver city, ask for Micah and he'll hook you up.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Pretty great Toyota! I was assisted by Nordine Houari and I was shown the vehicles I had in mind and explained to me the features of the different package tiers of the Camry and Prius (all models). I test drove all the cars I wanted. Nordine even got the car keys of different vehicles so we can sit inside the vehicles on the lot to experience the interiors. They were busy since it was the Saturday before Easter, so he had to help out others from time to time. They sold a lot of vehicles, so we waited a while to be assisted by the financial department. Since they were backed up, they had someone that hadn't done finance in a while assist us and the room that he was told to use wasn't properly equipped to complete the financial paperwork process. Other than that I'm happy to say that all staff was friendly and that I left happy with my new Camry Hybrid SE 2019.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

You would be hard up to find anyone else who could help you more than he will! He came recommended to me by a dear friend from church. I recently landed a great new job and desperately needed a reliable car to get me to and from work that I could count on, but my credit would not get me approved anywhere else. Not only did he work MAGIC, but he is kind, funny and truly cares. Even my super critical father (who was sure that I was going to get screwed by some sales guy) was impressed with what he was able to do for me. I could not say enough good things about him.

I had to call my dad because it sounded really fishy and they were telling me I wouldn't have to buy the care but once you read it it says you have to buy it. I guess  because I'm 21 they thought they can give me high interest rate and make me sign for a car that was overpriced but NO i found the same Jeep diesel with same mileage for 8 thousand less in Santa Monica and even gave me low interest.

George Boktor, head service manager, makes this place the go-to for purchasing a vehicle because you know throughout the life of your car you are going to receive the support of a service team that truly cares. George worked with me to find a solution for both of us that fit within my financial means. He continually updated me on the state of my vehicle. George is a true professional and because of him I would recommend Culver City Toyota to anyone< /Review>

DO NOT DEAL WITH Viktor Vilshansky

We all know a few rude car salesman but Victor is by far the worst of them all. Never have i meet such an unprofessional individual with a lack of human interaction skills. If you want someone that smells like he just smoked ten packs of cigarettes in one sitting then he is your man. This guy has anger issues and will make rude and absurd comments towards you. At one point he even wanted to kick us out because he didn't like our offer. He is someone that doesn't care about the customer and shouldn't be able to work with people. Here is a pic of the guy, stay away from him</Review>

I had a great experience buying my first car. I went in thinking I was going to get an idea and then make up my mind after. But after talking with Kai Phaithoon I was put more at ease about the whole car buying ordeal. He is very upfront about everything and managed to help my dad and I a lot. Even though we would repeat ourselves he was patient and answered all of our questions. Thank you Kai for making it a great experience!!!!

Just Ok, while they make efforts to reorganize and  redecorate the place they move to slow. The place is busy, serving a big segment of LA, so is pretty crowded, and probably overbooked. They take to much time to service the cars, a simply oil change once took almost 4 hours. All good otherwise but I suggest to plan some extra time for any visit.<//text>

Beware of this place. I would not recommend Culver City Toyota same ownership of Culver City Honda . I regret I ever came here. I should of read other bad reviews on Yelp.  I purchased a car here took my kids unfortunately had to wait for hours and  my kids being hungry from the long process. You have to double check you dont get charged differently when signing.As they try to add additional charges that's not on the price or window sticker and I still asked " I will not get charged twice. And I was told no.They ask how much can I afford why would I pay more than what is stated on price that has a break down including interest and fees.There car I purchased oil life was over due didnt notice the sticker on windshield. The rear cargo cover was not in car after it got sent to get washed.. The ac isn't blowing cold air and  It has only been less than  2 weeks.<//text>

< review>
I’ve been leasing a car with this dealership since 2015. I wanted to leave a positive review after giving the dealership the duration of my lease to improve my opinion of this customer service experience, but unfortunately, my opinion has only lowered since then.

My formative experience with leasing the car was less than pleasant. I spent about seven hours at the dealership, even though I came in knowing the exact make, model, and lease option I wanted. It took 45 minutes to get a sales consultant to help me, even though I came into the dealership in the early morning on a week day and there were salespeople moseying around, not helping anyone. It seemed that no one wanted to help me, maybe because I look too young to be a serious buyer?

I have stellar credit, post graduate education, and stable, sufficient income, so it was pretty insulting when the initial salesman that finally helped me assumed that I was too stupid to already be aware of the leasing option I was requesting and wasted my time trying to convince me that it wasn’t available (it was).

When someone finally did help me, they spent about an hour trying to convince me to lease an orange sherbet or powder blue color of the car than I had specified, despite my clear instruction that I wanted a specific color and it was clear they had that color in stock. Finally, the salesman insisted that the color/make/model I had requested had been sold—even though I arrived at the dealership long before the other prospective buyer. I know because I sat and watched the couple get assistance more quickly than me, while I was ignored. The salesman went on to say that I’d have to pay an additional fee of $200 to have the desired color car transferred from another location, at which point I decided to leave the dealership and go to another location. They chased me back to my car and apologized and magically decided they had found another car meeting my specifications on the lot, but only after I was leaving the lot and they were losing a sale.

I shouldn’t have to threaten to leave to get good customer service. I felt they only changed their attitude toward me after they had assessed my finances and determined I was a serious customer. Having worked in sales in the past, it seems prejudiced to value customers differently based on their appearance alone. Bad for your business to presume that young people aren’t as worthy of your attention.

Onward:
- While getting my car serviced, one of your service employees pulled my number from my information and tried to ask me out on a date. Totally invasion of my privacy. Made me very uncomfortable.
- Another Culver City service employee sold me a service package for three oil changes in the spring of this year. I didn’t want to purchase the package unless it was useable at other Toyota service locations, because I no longer reside near the Culver City location. The service employee ensured me that the oil change package was good at all Toyota locations. When I tried to use it at the Torrance location, it didn’t work. I tried to follow up with Culver City, and they told me that “the person who sold me the package had been terminated” and there was “nothing they could do” even though I just wanted a refund for the difference between the package that was misrepresented to me and the price of the one oil change I had already received. They said they would “get back to me” after speaking to a manager. No one ever did, and my calls have been unreturned. It wasn’t a selfish or unreasonable request and there was clearly an issue with the employee who sold the package to me. Again, poor service.
- I called to inquire about details regarding the end of my lease. It’s impossible to get anyone on the phone and no one calls me back. If there was a possibility of me continuing to prolong my interactions with Culver City Toyota, it ended here.

Needless to say, I will not be working with this location again. You have lost my business to another dealership that has the respect to offer the same level of service to everyone.< /review>

<Review>Follow up to my review 3 months ago - while getting riped off by being charged for the $700 repair that was covered under my warranty I was also told I needed to repair the water pump - another expensive repair. That was a bit weird for a car with 60k miles but ok I figured I would take care of it while I still had the extended warranty. Since my experience was so bad at Culver City Toyota I decided to take my car to the Santa Monica dealership instead. SM service checked out my car and said there was absolutely nothing wrong with my water pump. Nothing wrong! They even called CCT service to ask why they told me I needed a repair for something that was totally fine.
Such scam artists at Culver City Toyota. If you like wasting your money and getting treated like an idiot, Culver City Toyota is the right place for you. If not, steer clear and save your money!<//Review>< Pics>

We found a great deal on our certified used Prius V. Ishmail was very helpful. Would be five stars but it still took a couple of hours to get out of there once we made our decision, even though we were paying cash for the car. It's probably just my expectations that were off concerning how much time it should take to wrap up the deal (there's admittedly a lot of paperwork). However, it would be good if they had more people in finance to minimize the wait to be served by that department during busy times.< /text>

I purchased my car from this dealership.  I believed that I had not received a second set of keys.  I contacted both the salesman and the store manager twice (that's four calls)  to request keys.  Both people said that they would check out my request and get back to me.  They never did.  Later, I found the keys (which is great) but in this process, trust was broken.  I will not be back to Culver City Toyota for maintenance work.  My experience indicated that now that I owned the car, customer service was not a priority.  More importantly, I learned that I could not trust the word of Toyota's representatives. A person's word is the foundation of relationship--even a business relationship.< /text>

<Review>I came to this Toyota for a regular maintanence and I have to say that it is the worst Toyota Dealership i have been to. The service is terrible, bathrooms are far from the lobby, the space is  cramped and disgusting. Employees are rude here. The associate who was assisting me was asking about my basic information when they should already have that on their system. I have been to many Toyota dealerships to do maintanence on my car and none have asked me for my information like address etc. Exit is blocked by cars .. As i am leaving i notice the tire pressure on one tire is super low!!! When i came in all the tires were in perfect condition. Overall horrible horrible experience there. Do not come to this dealership!</Review>< UserId.>

<name>Heather Allen Spiegel< /name><review>Got me into a brand new 2018 Yaris iA the day after I unexpectedly totalled my old 2007 Corolla in a hydroplane incident. Worked with me on pricing to get the overall cost and monthly where I wanted it, and got a fabulous 0.9% APR with the end of model-year specials. They even got the model I wanted driven in all the way from Thousand Oaks just because I wanted red and all the stock nearby was sold out. No high pressure sales tactics, everyone was friendly and did their best to get me a deal I was comfortable with because they knew I wasn’t expecting to have to buy a new car. Also, highly recommend the Yaris iA for anyone who wants a small economy car. Doesn’t feel cheap at all, very fancy inside and drives beautifully. I grew up driving Camry’s and felt like a step down when I switched to Corolla, so I was worried about moving to an even “lesser” model, but I actually preferred the iA to the new Corolla on the inside and they both drove beautifully. Corolla has definitely improved in power though since my 2007 and seems like a higher level car now, too. Ask for Marcus, he was great.<//review>< Gmap_id>

The guys who work there are really good guys. Very friendly and helpful. BUT this dealership added a $5,000 "premium" to the sticker price of the car which they only mentioned after I sat down to negotiate. So a car with a 43k sticker price magically became a 48k car out of nowhere, and they tried to negotiate with me based off the totally arbitrary 48k which im sure is just 5k extra of pure profit to the dealership. They tried to add this fantasy 5k to two different cars that we discussed. The 5k was suddenly added on,  out of absolutely nowhere, and was never mentioned anywhere else and certainly not on the car window. I dont blame the guys who helped me, they were awesome, I'm not sure if this is just a Toyota policy or something. But it's stupid. So I left. Dont let a dealership try to add magic numbers to the sticker price of a car, obviously as a transparent negotiating tactic to try to get me to pay the full sticker price. So it's a great dealership with good staff and a good selection but as always with car dealers you have to go in there with your eyes open for tricks and the usual car dealer tactics.< /review>

< Review>
I really wanted to start with my background.
Car sales took many years out of my life and I have held several positions from sales to management and Internet sales director etc..
These guys have everything up to date, their specials, rebates, everything is where it's suppose to be. I found the information I was looking for easily.
Contacted the sales person and received one of those "HELLO I AM YOUR SALES PERSON" calls, whatever.
I went out for my appointment (This is the secret to get a good deal, not e-mail but actually being present at the dealer will give sales manager signal to very good deal instead of good deal.) pick the car and they showed me a deal right on the computer screen.
Now, price is honestly proposed. Yes, It's couple hundred dollars higher than some e-mails but me spending couple hours each on those costs me more money.
My payment options on the table not on the e-mail.
And they were honest about my trade. Our price is $500 less, we would like your car but if you want to sell it to carmax, please go ahead and let's complete this transaction.
Wow, cleanest close I have seen. Thank you Mr. Lux and Miller Toyota of LA</Review>

grate experience, we didn't feel the cheap tactics from other dealerships that pressure you to make a decision on the spot. Kendra Black took care of us, she really took the time to hear what we needed, no rush. I don't know other sale people on the store, but look for her, she is really professional.< /review>

<text>I really appreciate doing business with the greatest Toyota team I ever seen before. First I called and made appointment with Moises and he called back to remind me for the appointment then I went to the store and he came straight to me without knowing who I was, he was very interested to show me all the choices and models for the trucks I was looking to buy it, Moises introduced Sebastian his Manager then they called Nazinm over to make the business go thru and in the end Pratt took over the financial part and finished really quick and sharp so I could leave the place in my amazing Tacoma and they all were part of making my dream turned to reality. Thank you guys so much!</text>< pics>

<rating>1</rating><text>I’m very disappointed with the Toyota service oil change for my 2017 Rav4 as it was not completed well in April 2018. The oil cap was not tightened based on manufacture recommendation and therefore leaked oil in my garage, drive way and forced me to get it fixed while traveling +300 miles away from home. I incurred a charged $40.91 to get my oil filter tighten and lost oil so that I could drive home safely with my family.  I would not recommend Toyota service at Culver City location going forward.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

Terrible service, no desire to help you at all.

So I filled out a Kelly Blue Book evaluation of my trade in and wanted to get my vehicle inspected and discuss the possibility of trading it in for another vehicle.  I was sent a generic email by their “internet specialist” Billy.  I emailed him back and also attempted to call him multiple times to schedule a time to come in.  When he didn’t reply I asked the receptionist when he was scheduled but she couldn’t give me a concrete time and just sent me to his voicemail.  He never reached out or emailed me again.  This is important because the KBB trade in quote is only good for 72 hours.

Then I called back another time and merely asked to speak to the sales manager.  The lady at the reception desk merely said okay and then left me on hold for 30 minutes.  When I heard nothing I hung up and called back thinking she merely made a mistake but she put me right back on hold with no explanation.  Finally she directed me to someone’s voicemail.  I have no idea if he’s a sales manager but I merely left a quick message and hung up.  Not worth your time if this is how they’re going to treat you before you even come in.</text>

Shuttle van was great.
Came here to 10k maintenance and I am so upset with them. Personnel there are like robot and don't give 1 penny about customer service.  My tire top side were missing on both ends and they claim it because I ran on low pressure and should had seen light. Well,  this light never came on. They wouldn't offer any kind of help there or advice. They only said I was not covered. Car has only 10,000 miles. Never coming here< /review>

Amazing experience, went in for a new car for my family and was helped in choosing the right one by Nano. He was extremely friendly and helpful in answering all my questions. Once the right car was chosen Jordan helped me with all my finance questions and packages for the car. Needless to say I left with a beautiful brand new car thanks to Nano and Jordan.</Review>

Currently in the process of taking the dealership to court. They misrepresented the car I bought as having navigation. Once I got home, I realized it did not. I asked them to help pay for only a portion to have it installed. They ignored my calls and attempts for over a week now. Unfortunately for them, I have evidence of everything and have documented all communication and misrepresentation. Sad they would rather lose thousands in court than simply work with someone directly. Avoid at all costs!</Review>

Culver Toyota is worst dealership really negative experience

If you offer them your price they get mad and insulting you like kicking out the customer from their. Office

Do not buy from these guys and definitely do not finance from Toyota Financial Services. They fooled me into leasing as a first time car buyer when I wanted to buy used. The car is worth $17,500 and I owe $22,500 on it. It's a waste of money folks! My back is to the wall in debt and it's all because they screwed me.

I don't need the car anymore and I am trying to get rid of it and liquidate the debt. My life is essentially ruined and there is no way to get out of the lease even willing to go into debt to correct the mistake.

I'm paying $451 / Month for a Toyota Prius. I should be driving a Mercedes. I took it back to get appraised and with 9,000 miles on the car and they undervalued the car by over $3,000.

They are filth of the earth scum and I personally told the manager that I will go out of my way to ruin their reputation. From now on every Saturday I'm going to walk in there and personally disrupt the salesman's transactions with customers as I feel it is my right to educate people about how horrible they are. I'm going to do it verbally and there's nothing they can do to stop me. Please do yourself a favor and do not do business with these people - they are not ethical.<//text>

Bought a black Toyota Prius here with a bunch of micro scratches. I didn’t notice them at first because I came to the dealership when the sun was going down. I brought it in a couple of days later and they didn’t do much to get rid of them. Also they forgot to order my license plates from the dmv.</text>

I had a maintenance light on my Prius and took it in to be checked. They told me that 1/3rd of my coolant had leaked out and if I didn't replace the engine water pump my engine would be permanently damaged and would have to be replaced. They also said I had two other leaks which needed to be fixed. All together costing over $2700. I didn't want my engine damaged so I only had the water pump replaced. I took my car to my fathers mechanic the next day. He did a full inspection and found nothing wrong and no leaks. My dad asked me if I park in the same spot every day, and I said yes. He asked if there is a stain or puddle in my spot. I answered," No my car doesn't leak". And then I realized, I've been had! $2700 in leak repairs for a car that has no leak! Culver City Toyota is a dishonest lying bunch of scum! Do NOT trust them, do NOT believe their claims of wear on your car. Better yet, never take your car there.< /review>

< Review>
Do not waste your money here! This dealership will con you into the car they want you to get, well knowing that the car isn't worth a fine. As a first time car buyer, I told them my situation and expected them to help. Instead they put me into a hole of debt with how many repairs came on top on the ridiculous car payment. They sold me a car knowing it was BROKEN! The only thing you don't want your car to be. The whole harnessing assembly is was glued back together by their staff. Glued. They were well aware of this issue and just let me walk in and buy it without even mentioning that. These are money hungry animals that have no human decency!</Review>

So many things have gone wrong here. If you buy a certified used car, inspect very carefully because they do not care whether it is up to the standard it is supposed to be. Service here is spotty. They overcharge for everything. They dont treat customers with respect. You do know you will pay hundreds more in tax because culver city's tax rate is one of the highest around?<//review>

The sale team are very cunning and fraudulent minded. They agreed on one sales price of a car but they bring the computer printout the price was increased by two thousand dollars. When confronted they didn’t wanted to talk about it and they didn’t want to sell no more. One of the guy said he would prefer to sell it to his beloved sales person. They even didn’t say goodbye. They walked out trying to humiliate us. They also said some very harsh words. Makes us very sad<//Text>

<text>I have purchased or assisted with the purchase of many cars in my day, and never have I received the kind and professional service I received at Culver City Toyota. I was greeted with a smile, and by the end of it I was leaving with one on my face as well. A good friend of mine recently started have MAJOR trouble with her old SUV, and decided it was time to get something new (well... Certified Pre Owned at least). With the assistance of salesperson Joseph and manager Allen Johnson, she is now driving a Camry, and LOVES IT!

Thank you guys so much for the wonderful service! You will have ALL of my business in the near future.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<username>Timo R<//username><Review>I came in for a piece that fell off my hubcap. I was told the part would arrive a week later. I told them if they  can call me when the part arrives. They told me not to worry about it and that part would be there for sure next week.  I showed up a week later and there was no part. In fact, they never ordered the part. The gentleman that was assisting me told me that the part would come in 3 days and he would call me in the morning to let me know that it arrived. I am still waiting for his call.</Review>< date>

<Text>Our Salesperson, Barry Talei, was amazing. Trading in our Baby Benz was a very hard thing to do.  However Barry helped us with the transitioning by providing us with his friendliness, witty personality and by answering all our questions.  Our buying experience was hassle free from the very beginning, which is a rare thing that happens during such a transaction.  We negotiated via email until we found a price that I was comfortable  in paying.  Therefore we eliminated the whole uncomfortable pushing of papers back and forth to find the right price. When we got to the dealership we just filled up the paperwork.  That day, we drove home with our new 4Runner with smiles on our face and knowing that we have truly found a Salesperson that is genuine.  Barry Talei is our go-to Toyota Salesperson.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Worst most unethical dealership. Dianna in internet sales will quote price then retract quoted price. Charging 7500 dollars above msrp for vehicle because the color is "rare".

DO NOT TAKE YOUR OLDER CARS & TRUCKS TO THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!! their service department has no clue what their doing!! I purchased a package of 3x oil/fluid changes and tire rotation. I brought my vintage LandCruiser in and they almost ceased my engine after putting in the wrong size oil filter and 4 qts of the wrong oil (30wt) in an engine that requires 8qts (40wt). I’m lucky my regular mechanic caught the mistake a few weeks later. I called and told them what happed & the service manager seemed to not care at all. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE CENTER!!!!

Monique, please spare me the canned auto response if your dealership truly cared about customer service you would take a look at the situation and reach out to the customer.</text>

Hello, dissapointed with the delays and lack of customer service. Never sell or buy a car from here. Finance and sales department is not helpful. Elizabeth On Azalea is good, but just left me gangling after they got the car and bought it and I signed. I enjoy a lot the service department, great, shoutout to Randy. However, the finance and sales department hasn’t been useful and has taken ages to solve my problem. Sold a Toyota Celica to them and signed the paper and Elizabeth has been on top of paying off the car as agreed and still nothing has happened. I’ve been testing, calling, and it’s just delayed and delayed and delayed. You cannot sell or have anything done smoothly with these departments. There is toooo much friction when working with these people. Took tons of time just to sell my car and now it’s about to be my next payment date and they haven’t paid it off<//Text>

When I arrived, I was warmly welcomed immediately by Dale Evee. He was friendly and introduced me to Wilson who helped me through the whole process. I'll be honest, I had an appointment with Carmax for the following day and had come in mostly to shop around so that I'd be more informed for my appointment the next day. But I actually really liked Wilson, he listened to my situation and needs, and helped me find a vehicle that I was really happy with and terms that I was pretty comfortable with, so I decided to just stick with Culver City Toyota. Between Wilson and Dale, I felt very well taken care of. They did an appropriate amount of bargaining, without making it uncomfortable, and by the end of the day I drove off in a car that I already love, and have nothing but warm feeling about the whole process.

I would like to add that I had my 5 year old son with me the entire time and everyone was really nice to him, and made it fun for him too. Dale brought out paper and Crayons M&Ms, and made paper airplanes with him. As anyone might understand, the process can take a little while and would not normally be fun for a 5 year old, but the staff was so friendly that he really had a blast.

Happy with the car, happy with the service, happy with Culver City Toyota!< /review>

my first experience with Culver city Toyota was average and I didn't think I was coming back but ONE person can change all that, and one did. The sales person I saw last night was EXCEPTIONAL AND EXCELLENT. Really made my buying experience fantastic. I wish all salespersons were like him.

A year ago Gary Morales was the person who helped me lease a car he was great, jump to January 2019 I receive a email from Pepe suggesting I should purchase the car because the mileage due to my job, I drive quite a bit. I agreed and when I went in they were so nice and then he had Moises help me my payments leasing the vehicle were good $347 a month reasonable for me. Mind you I've always been hesitant of car dealerships because their shady to me but I figured I give them a chance because Gary Morales earned my trust. Moises and Jacqueline Frost are deceivers. Jacqueline was suppose to cancel my lease contract on January 29th and today is February 13th and it was never done when she said. She said I have 60 days to cancel gap coverage and lied about that! Moises promised to help keep my purchase monthly pymts similar to what my lease pymts were, LIES!! You can't reach them on the phone and then when you do speaking of Jacqueline she acted rude and stupid on the phone and contradict what she said in her office. I will NEVER purchase another car from Culver City Toyota!!! In a time when customer service experience is key, next time I'll shop elsewhere where the staff value you as a customer!<//review>

I TOLD HIM MY PRICE $ 225.00 A MONTH .

I got my car here. The salesman was good. His sales manager also good. But his finance manager call me back and said that my carloan did not get aprove make me go back and ask me for more income after 3 weeks of driving the car he said that if I don't show him more income he will take the car and my money I gave him as a down payment. Wich I couldn't prove because I already disclouse that from the getgo. He insult me and my wife super rude. I would never recommend anyone into culver city because the manager are not trained to give costumer service. After I went back I request talking to the GM and they said he wasn't there. A different manager talk to me and fix my issue saying they were loosing money. What a headache! They treat me if I leave with the car they will report it stolen. I said go ahead I am leaving. But they block my car in the parking lot without me leaving until they fix my problem. Please SAVE YOURSELF A HEADACHE AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! I am never doing bussiness with this people againg.</Text>

I bought a 2007 Prius at the end of 2016 for $7500.

I was repeatedly assured by extremely sleazy salesman that the battery would last for years as it had just been replaced.  He provided a car fax to support this claim.  He even lied to my elderly father who came along to help out.

Four months later the battery is completely dead.  The car is just parked in a neighborhood until I can figure out what to do with this bankrupting hunk of scrap.

Do not buy your car here.</text>

We recently leased a vehicle from Culver City Toyota.  Our service and customer service experience was top notch.  Thanks to the assistance of Kai Phaithoon, we ended up with a great vehicle at a price better than we initially though was possible.  I highly recommend Culver City Toyota and Kai Phaithoon.<//text>

<username>Vlad Latman<//username><Time>1454376349346<//Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>I had a great experience at this dealership thanks to Bruce Pardoe. I was trying to help my mom find a new car and made a recommendation for a Prius. We drove to Culver Toyota for a look and test drive of the 2016 Prius. Bruce was the assigned car dealer, and I don't think that my mom could have been luckier. He showed us around the whole lot and explained every little detail about any car my mom expressed interest in. He is a really cool guy and shows great care for his customers. He never tried to push us for a purchase, and thanks for his broad knowledge of Toyota's, my mom settled for the Corolla, which he explained would save us money based on my mom's 2003 Camry driving history. He gave us the best deal available of any dealership when he reviewed prices. He courteously let us think about the presented options, but in a couple of days my mom found a better deal from another dealership. Bruce said he would match, and true to his word, he gave us the best price we could find for the 2016 Corolla. He was as professional as when we first met him, and even contacted us a few days after the purchase to make sure my mom was satisfied with her car. Bruce represents customer service at its finest, and any person looking to purchase a new car should have a similar experience. If Culver City Toyota is within your driving distance, I recommend you contact Bruce for a truly pleasant buying experience. You will thank me later.<//text>< pics>

Like any another car buying experience, it took awhile till Dexter, our sales rep and I had finalize a deal that my wife and I could not pass. He made the process with ease, even with a toddler and an infant with us! We came in with intent on buying our first minivan as we out grew our sedan. We have norrowed our choices to a 2017 Sienna SE in Super White. Being on the end of the year production for the 2017( I have seen the in coming 2018 and I am not a fan of the new design), the availibility was slim for that particular trim and color. But not with Culver City Toyota! They have the exact trim and color and even the SE premium edition in Super White which we end up loving and taking home! Dexter and Dave worked their magic and process our trade-in and even have us walking away with a promotional 0%APR on our new Sienna (a FREE LOAN) and with a extanded warranty to top it off.

I would go out of my way and come back to Culver City Toyota and recommend it to my Family and friends.</review>

Terrible customer service. Zero common sense and staff needs to be retrained in the different departments.
Purchased a car and was only given one set of keys. I was contacted by Lucy to bring the car in to have it re keyed and would only take 45 min. I go in and I am told it would take 2 hrs and I still have to go back another time because they had to put a request for the hard key to be made. I told them that I would do all at once. Service agent mentioned she would call me within 5 business days to let me know that they key got to the agency. Never received a call. Sent an e mail, and Monique, contacted me, another CSM. She apologized for the inconveniences and to bring the car in at 2 and it would get done. I brought the car in, waited 2 hrs and my car had not been touched. If you have had problems w a customer, you ensure a manager oversees the process so no more problems occur. It was then when I demanded to have my car back and that they pick up my car from my home and bring it back to me re keyed. I was inconvenienced for something it was not my fault! I got a car with one set of keys and it is not my fault they they did not have the second set of keys. I was told I would be contacted by the service manager to confirm the time of the pick up. I had to call because it was the following day at 5pm and then he finally called back, set a time and had the car picked up the following day. Since when a customer has to contact them several times when they have clearly messed up! Oh and I e mailed the GM and never heard back from him!<//Review>

We got here looking for a new vehicle. When I asked for the price of th said vehicle I was quoted one price, and when  I requested a written quote, the price was driven up 10k!!! So I walked out the door. On my way out, the salesman caught up to me with another paper, claiming that his manager had made a mistake on the previous quote. Wheb I was handed the paper, not only had they kept the original 10k surcharge, but they slapped on an extra 600 bucks just for good measure I suppose. So that was my experience with this particular dealership.< /Review>

I had a very pleasant experience. Fleet Manager,  Brandyn Toney was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly; as was the Finance Specialist, Matt Ayhan.  They clearly explained all the details from the car's specs to the lease terms.  I am very happy with my purchase of a Rav 4 and believe I got a great deal!</text>

My daughter bought used 2014 Fiat with 24k miles about 8 months ago from Culver City Toyota. Turns out car had a faulty harness assembly that had been shoddily repaired. Fiat breaks down and towed to Fiat dealership who informs my daughter that Fiat will not honor warranty as repairs where not done correctly. My daughter also had purchased an additional warranty through Toyota  dealership which will also would not pay for repairs ($1,700.00). We have repeatedly called Toyota dealership and once we explain the issue  they say they will look into it and get back to us but no one will return call. We have made numerous calls with absolutely no response. Culver City Toyota sold my daughter a defective car. Beware doing business with this dealership.</Text>

Well then, do yourself a huge favor and NEVER take it to the Toyota Culver City Service department.

They overcharged us more than $200 on recent services, which may not even have been needed. On top of that, guess how they took out their sweet revenge after I called to inquire about the charges mid-service? They poured an inch of SYNTHETIC MOTOR OIL in the hideaway cargo, which seeped into everything in there, ruining some Ikea bowls and the tie-down belt. Now I have to go back in there with a heavy-duty grease cleaner now.

Worst experience! Manager Matt is beyond rude and disrespectful. I was asked to not come back because he would not sell me a car. All because I made him waste his time. Deal was 95% completed not my fault car has damage due to them using it.<//Review>

<Review>I went in to test drive and possibly buy/lease a Prius. Talked to Jerome who was very helpful. I ended up  buying a prius elsewhere, but Jerome was very helpful and gave me information that helped me decide.
There were a couple of other people who I saw there while negotiating a lease. Those guys were pushy, but Jerome wasn't. I think it was more likely that I would lease something if they were not pushy.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp><user_name>Ali Akhavan< /user_name><user>113311739704849187937< /user>< pictures>

I purchased a Prius here in 2009.  A few months later I brought it in with brake problems.  I explained that I would be driving with my two small children across the desert to visit family in Nevada.  They kept my car and stated they'd done a complete service and there were no problems.

I headed out to Nevada and experienced heavy vibrations, burning smells and squealing.  I drove it to a Toyota dealer in Henderson who was so upset at the state of the brakes HE called Miller and berated them for sending me out with only 10% brake life.  He also reported them to Toyota USA.  When I called Miller, they gave me a lame excuse that when they drove the car around the block their techs didn't notice anything.

I had to have all four brakes replaces and rotors machined.  I insisted on seeing all the parts and the brakes while the vehicle was on the lift.  Sure enough the brakes had nearly disintegrated.

Brakes are serious business.  Safety is serious business.  These people are not serious people.

My children could have died because they are either too lazy or too incompetent to do their job properly.

Unacceptable.  Shame on Miller.<//text>

Toyota of culver city is an amazing dealership! My family and I were in need of a great and reliable car so we went in to check it out. The staff was phenomenal and showed the up most hospitality! Ruben was our car salesman. He was very professional and helped us get he best deal for us financially and for our family of four. We chose a 2017 Toyota yaris iA. He knew all about the car and it's features and more. We also brought our 2 children with us (I know some dealerships get annoyed with that) and Ruben and the rest of the staff were very nice and interactive with them. Moving on to the end of our visit, we met with Gene in the finance department, who also , was very professional and attentive to our needs. We wanted to get an extended warranty on our new car and he was so kind to help us with the best deal. The process was quick and in a little over 2 hours we drove off the lot with our brand new car! Thank you to Ruben and the whole staff at Toyota of culver city for the quick, professional, and very satisfying experience. We definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking to purchase a new or used car!!!</review>

5 stars for Brandyn Toney who I bought my car from and 0 stars for  Viktor Vilshansky. I walked into Culver City Toyota on a Sunday after two other dealerships looking for a best deal. As Viktor's manager was getting a quote to offer me, Viktor berated me and made condescending statements. I left before hearing the quote as I would prefer to not provide any money to a business that employs individuals who behave in that manner. So why did I go back? Costco sent me a deal on a Prius from Culver City Toyota. I was dead set against going but my friend convinced me. I am grateful that Brandyn worked with me to get a deal. He was polite and I got a good deal. Given Viktor's behavior, I would still recommend not going here if you are a woman. His behavior is the reason that we have laws about discrimination. His level of misogyny was unmatched across any dealer that I interacted with.</Text>

Starting with my awesome salesperson Jorge Hernandez the experience was excellent. Buying a new car can be very nervous making, traumatic, stressful, worrisome and a torture! Jorge was great, patient, very very knowledgeable, considerate of all my concerns and helpful even after my buying the car when I went back for some more instruction and concerns.
Farid Alhamed, the floor manager, also was special.  He listened to all my concerns, knew exactly how to help me with those concerns, was a true gentleman and not just a super salesman in for the "close". He, too, was very informed, very knowledgeable and I felt I was not just another number.
Matt Ayhan, Finance Specialist, he too, patient, very willing to carefully and explicitly explain and outline all the details of the financing and the insurance. I feel I can call him with any questions or concerns that may arise.
I would say I had a very positive experience with Culver City Toyota and I was most pleasantly surprised. It helps when you are treated as a human being and not just another dollar sign.< /text>

Went there this morning to have my car fixed due to a recall.  When I made the appointment the young lady said it would take about two hours.  When I returned after two hours and change the car was exactly where the guy left it.  Needless to say, what a waste of time.  I wonder if because the dealerships aren't making money on these repairs that they shuffle this type of work to the back of the line until they can service their money-making repairs...</text>

BAD!!!!! BAD!!!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE...
I HAVE SPENT ARROUND $4,500 IN REPAIRS AND PARTS NEEDED FOR MY TOYOTA YARIS.
ANYWAY TOOK IN A BATTERY THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE A 60 MONTH WARRANTY. BATTERY LASTED ONLY 38 MONTHS..THE PARTS MANAGER, MR. SAMUEL OJEDA, WAS NOT HELPFUL AT ALL. HE SAID NO MORE WARRANTY THAT I NEEDED TO PAY 75% OF THE NEW ONE. HE ALSO SAID HE COULD NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, MAYBE MY BATTERY WAS STILL GOOD. I SAID TO TESTED PLEASE, HE SAID NO. HE EVEN MADE FACES INFRONT OF OTHER CUSTOMERS AND HE ASK ME TO LEAVE. I HAD THE ORIGINAL RECEIPT...I END UP PAYING 50% OF THE NEW BATTERY...

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Had been taking my '06 Rav 4 here for oil changes, the car had been burning oil for years. had to add 3-5 quarts between oil changes. So I finally get a technical bulletin from Toyota about excessive oil consumption, instructing me to take the car to a dealer for an oil consumption test. Basically they top off the oil, and you bring the car back after a specific number of miles and they check it. Before they start the test they check the engine for leaks, I was told that the car was okay to perform the test. When I brought the car back after the required miles I was told that the test was invalid due to oil leaks from the engine, and that the car would need 1700.00 in repairs to do the consumption test again. I took the car to an independent mechanic who thoroughly checked the car and found no leaks! Tried another dealer, and they did the test, determined that car was burning oil,gave me a free loaner, and fixed it! No questions asked.These guys lost a customer big time. Woulda gave zero stars if I could<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I think a bait and switch tactic was used. Telling me there was a warranty and then coming in after I signed papers and telling me there was no warranty. I was caught off guard and if I had it to do over I would have walked out.  I do not recommend this place.< /Text>

<text>Ive had a very negative experience with the Culver City Service Dept. I brought it in to replace a cracked windshield, my insurance covered it, no problems, but the Toyota service department hasn't pulled through. I have brought it in 3 times now over the past two months.

They didn't have the part when I first brought it in, so they had to order it. They had it in the shop for a week before telling me this and letting me pick it up. Then the part came in two weeks later, even though it was promised to come in two days. When I got the call to bring my car in, it sat there for two days before they called me to tell me that the part had a scratch in it.

Now I've brought it in for the third time and after getting a call that the new part is in. It has been there for 8 hours and they just told me that they had to order the part, and acted surprised when I reminded them that they told me it was already in. They also told me they didn't have the insurance information about my claim, even though it was approved and cleared two months ago.

Overall, I my experience has been incredibly frustrating, and they seem disorganized. If I can have my car serviced at a different dealership, I will. I really wouldn't recommend this dealership for service.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Nazeem worked with me and he was awesome! Sebastian was soooooo helpful. His patience with me was outstanding.  Jordan in finance was super cool! And let's not forget my 2017 Toyota Camry XLE Hybrid!!! I absolutely love this car!  Nazeem recommended it and I'm very satisfied with my purchase!

My husband walked into Culver City Toyota knowing exactly what we wanted and the price we were willing to pay.  We used our USAA TrueCar pricing. Kai Phaithoon was our sales person and was very helpful at getting us just what we wanted and saving us money along the way. However, just like anytime you by a car everything is hurry up and wait!! Over all a very good experience!</review>

I worked with Kai Phaithoon to purchase a Prius Plug-In.  I was turning my current leased BMW in and leasing a Prius Plug-in.  I worked with Kai from day one.  He knew this was going to take some time for me because I started the process more than 1 month from the time of purchase.   He was very patient, followed up with me a reasonable amount and was NEVER too pushy.  He got me a very large discount compared to the other Toyota dealers and he made the process easy.  Thank you Culver City Toyota!!!! and thank you Kai!</text>

My boyfriend and I are extremely happy with the sales team at Culver City Toyota, especially KAI who helped our 2015 Prius purchase go so smoothly. Every decision regarding the car was done online as well as the credit application. When we pulled up to our meeting at the dealership, our car was ready for us to test drive and the paperwork was all ready to sign. Kai was extremely helpful & very nice with a positive personality!!! After the paper work was signed, we were escorted to financial where Richard had us sign the last leg of paperwork regarding the lease as well as explain details of what we were signing. I didn't feel rushed or anything and the whole experience took 2 HOURS!  If you are looking into leasing/purchasing a hybrid car, particularly a Prius, please go visit Kai. EXTREMELY HAPPY ABOUT THE BLACK FRIDAY DEAL!!  Thanks :)< /text>

I went to get my trunk lock replaced -- I had already had the problem diagnosed at my usual auto shop, but they didn't have the part and told me to go to the dealer to get it right away.  When I went the service guy (Randy Castellanos) told me I needed to pay $120 to get it checked out; and like an idiot I was under the false pretense that they actually had the part available and surely it couldn't all cost more than that.  After two hours they came back to tell me what I already knew, and that they didn't have the part, that they would have to order it, and that it would cost me just over $350 to replace -- but don't worry, he said, the $120 would go towards the final cost.  I made an appointment two weeks later with the same guy  to get it replaced, but when I went in the part still hadn't been ordered.

Ultimately I went back to my old shop to discover that the replacement part and labor would have cost me $113.79 if I had just gotten it replaced there.  I'm pissed at everyone including myself, but I'm particularly pissed at Toyota for being such an outrageous rip off.  This kind of thing should never happen at an honest place of business.  You want good service?  Go to Ed Little.< /text>

<review>Purchased my brand new 2014 Prius here from Elaine Sanchez.  Ask for her if you want a great deal with NO BS and NO sales tricks.  I pretty much did all my research online and knew what car I wanted and with what options.  I called around a couple of dealerships and a few of them had the car I wanted in stock so I got a couple of quotes.  After a few days of back n forth emails and text messages it boiled down to 2 dealerships.  In the end, Toyota Culver City won my business.

After agreeing on an OTD cost all I needed to do was come in and sign the paperwork.  Met with Bob.  Funny and great guy!  His attitude really made a normally uncomfortable situation (handing over thousands of $) pleasant!  After completing finance, Elaine provided me with some last minute instructions about the car and connected my phone (via Bluetooth) then I was on my way.

Thanks Toyota Culver City and thanks to Elaine S!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Sales person Nordine was so nice, trying to help me but the problem was the floor management, they don't try to do the bussines, asking me for too many info about my income and too much down payment, they keep me for like three weeks waiting if they do or not the bussines, I know my credit was too low and the big negative on my trade, so I went to DCH simi valley and they did my bussines without to ask to many info, and get my car so fast, I was in the dealer just 2 hours and go out with my new truck.

Thanks you Nordine for try to help me but sorry for the floor management they dont help you<//Review>< Pics>

Worst dealer shop ever. Never buy any extended warranty for the used car from here, they never cancel it. They told me it would  take only 4-6 weeks, but it has been more than 11 weeks.  I have tried reached a financial manager here more than 20 times, but they have never answered to the call and have never got back to me. Soooooo disappointed< /Review>

<date>1549794939498<//date><rate>1< /rate><review>I called regarding concerns that my tires were under-inflated after purchasing 3 oil change/ tire maintenance packages and was given the runaround to multiple departments. Called back after an hour and a half to ask again after being told my call would be returned after a few minutes to be told “the receptionist took down your information to be transferred to the wrong department”. I had to be transferred so many times it was dizzying, and I never got any solid answers other than someone else will call me back later, and when I asked for a refund finally because my service was so obviously incomplete, I was told that I’d need to wait for another manager to call...who I was supposed to be transferred to several times ago in the first place.

After being run around so many times, I refused any additional “assistance” and opted to dispute the charge through my bank. I received excellent service my first visit, but never once did I complain that my AC was left on full blast at the lowest temperature, my seat was raised up as high as humanly possible which takes time, and nearly 1/8 a tank of gas was missing from my car. Things that were not done to my vehicle the last time it was brought in for an IDENTICAL service. I expressed multiple concerns about how my tires could’ve become so imbalanced so quickly, and I was told that maybe it was a preexisting issue...on four identical brand new tires that are less than a couple of months old and that there were “no notes” from my service that would imply any problems. The tire shop I will now have to go back to twice to re-balance my tires had to use two separate gauges because they couldn’t believe how off they were. Hopefully this just gets resolved quickly through my bank, because what began as a simple question so needlessly turned into such a huge ordeal. I forgave the mountain of issues surrounding my appointment in the beginning under the impression that the service would be once again worth it, but i won’t be returning for my remaining two services, and I’m hoping to be refunded for the massive hassle of having to correct these issues after the fact when I don’t have loads of time to constantly go to new repair shops for things that shouldn’t have been so out of place in the first place.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Going into toyota was the best i had a old car 1993 to be a little more specific and i was treated very well they showed me around. I felt very welcome they explained everything very well to me the service overall was perfect. Im pretty late on my review i went in to toyota in February so im sure the problem i had was fixed by now. One thing was there system to sign kept messing up which made the whole buying a car process longer than it should have.</Review>< pics>

After shopping around for a new car for 6 months, Culver City toyota was a game changer. As soon as I walked into the facility there was such a bright energy in there with happy hard working employees. I absolutely loved working with Nourdine! He was very clear and directive... no games! He was also very nice and willing to try very hard! I'm so so so happy! I've been wanting a 2017 RAV4 for a while now. I finally got one and I LOVE IT! Thank you to Culver City toyota!<//text>

We bought a new 2017 Prius two at this dealership through the Costco Auto Program. The pricing is great (better than TrueCar and other quotes we asked for in the LA area, after comparing 7 dealerships.)

At the dealership, Brandyn Toney was our salesperson for the Costco program, and he was friendly, informative, and genuine. (We had experience with other car salespeople who gave misleading or false information and Brandyn was very different.) We did not need to haggle and he even suggested that we should keep our own financing rather than go through Toyota because our rates are better (even though his commission might have been better if we went through Toyota.) The only hiccup was that there was initial discrepancies between what our bank representative told us about our pre-approval letter and what he told us: we originally thought that with a pre-approval letter and own financing, the dealer will not need to run our credit. After calling the bank, it turned out that Brandyn was right: although this dealer is in the network with our bank, because they used RouteOne instead of DealerTrack, they still needed to do a credit check.

Dave D was our finance manager. He was friendly and helped with our paperwork. However, he spent a long time trying to sell us Toyota extended warranty, even after we indicated we were not interested (although we could have been more direct in saying no.) He did not say that we had the option of buying this at any Toyota dealership within the first two years of purchase, which we later found out online after the purchase. Overall, we got our registration and other paperwork done and the price is good so we are happy with the experience.

The main reason we are giving four stars is that the whole process took 5.5 hours, even though we did not haggle on price. (We called before coming to ask how long to budget and they said 2.5 hours.) Thankfully we went in early afternoon so had time. We would recommend buying a vehicle through this dealership and would strongly suggest going through the Costco auto program to get the best savings without haggling.</Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>My experience with Culver City Toyota was absolutely horrendous. This is the first place of business where I've been where some of the workers treat you like they are doing you a favor, when in actuality they are trying to rip you off and not really help you. I understand there is a job that needs to get done, but to lose absolutely all regards and empathy towards people is completely disgusting. Also, Jordan McCloud in finance was very rude and condescending. I've never been blatantly disrespected and cursed out in a place of business by an employee in my life. You don't have to manipulate, abuse or bully consumers into buying a product. Lastly, there was some bigotry displayed from Jordan McCloud. No manager or anyone came to step in. Very unprofessional and disappointing. I will never purchase another Toyota period after this experience.<//review>< date>

<text>I purchased a 2015 Prius with Kai Phaitoon from Culver City Toyota at the end of May.  He was very honest and straightforward with me regarding TrueCar pricing and any questions I had.  It was a no-hassle and no-haggle experience and I was probably in and out with a car all within 90 minutes.

Highly recommend.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>My mom and I co-bought a brand new Toyota Camry. We didn't have a good sales experience. We found the car we wanted test drove it and went ro the finance office. We added leather seats which took about too weeks which wasnt bad because they gave us a loaner. Well with good credit and we were told no money down and my mom is no joke when it comes to her credit and her money.  We didnt like the numbers in the finance office. After about 4 hours of going back and forth the finance manager gives us a bill of sale thats says 0 down payment but my mom didnt like the price of the car so she said no. So the finance manager says I wont make you sign it but here is another one and tell me how you like these numbers. It was much better, but the problem was the 2nd paper that was signed said a 500 down payment. So it went un noticed. We go to our credit union and finance the car thru them and Toyota is paid in full and even gives us a check for $29 for overpayment. So a few months go buy and we get harassing phone calls about a $500 down payment and we are like what are you talking about, the car isnt even financed thru Toyota and they sent us a check for overpayment. Well those phone calls turn to court. They took us to court for a $500 down payment. We end up at Santa Monica courthouse. A rep from this dealership or whomever states his case. I'm speaking on our behalf since the car is in both of my mother and I name and she had a stroke so she cant speak so well and I say "your honor we have two bill of sales and we were told no money down and Toyota sent us a check for overpayment and he ask for proof. The judge looks over all the paperwork and says and takes about 2 minutes to do some math calculations and state to the plantiff that "these numbers on these bill of sales dont add up" and he goes on and tries to explain and he cant. The judge gives our paperwork to the bailiff to hand back to us and he says. He says "judgement for the defendant" "you are free to go" and my mom and I look at each other and smile. Moral of the story. Always check your bill of sale, never sign anything if you dont feel comfortable and read everything carefully because you could be lawfully siging your rights away. Take as long as you want to read everything and keep all paperwork.< /Text><userid>102250027180985706276<//userid>< response>

Brought in my Toyota Camry Hybrid for the 35k mileage oil change. I also ordered an express wash/detail. Got the car back 4 hours later and they did a crap job cleaning the car. Also they scratched my back bumper and the passenger-side door stopped auto-locking. Left the car there over the following week and they fixed the scratch and the door. The didn't re-clean the car though so the Express Detail was a waste of money. It's now 2 weeks later and the passenger-side door doesn't work again so they didn't fix it the right way.

TLDR: Only took the car in for an oil change and wash. Got the car back with half-assed wash, broken door, and scratched bumper.<//text>

They missed the fact that the axle was cracked during the full all points inspection we had to pay for. Service was so ridiculously slow, took 6 hours for an oil change and inspection. There is no communication between the garage and the service reps who you actually talk to so you have no idea what is going on at any point even when it is just an oil change.

Appointments don't matter at all. They just make it all up. when you call you talk to someone in a call center who has never even spoken to anyone at the dealership and has no power do do anything expect make you a useless appointment and give you a price that will change when you actually get there.

Don't take you car here. They are expensive, slow, and don't even provide quality service.</Text>

“Toyota culver city is a decent shop with a great location but I can NOT give them my rec.”

In 2016, My local mechanic said there was a problem with the timing chain tensioner on my 2010 prius.  Teddy assured me that mine was fine.  My prius continued to have “oil leak” problems to which teddy responded that my intake just needed to cleaned.  I took my prius to Toyota santa monica 2 times in 2017.  The 2nd time, they noticed my timing chain tensioner needed replacement.  Toyota culver city is a decent shop with a great location but I can NOT give them my rec.</Text>

Great place to buy a used car, at least that part seems to have worked our for me so far... but DON'T buy the warranty they will try to sell you when you hit the finance department! It is a warranty for a 3rd party warranty company NOT a Toyota warranty. The best part though is that this warranty company isn't even rated by the BBB. As a matter of fact I had a hard time finding them at all and what I did seem to find out about them was far less than reliable. The warranty they dumped on me is called KORNERSTONE.
THIS BUSINESS IS NOT BBB ACCREDITED
KORNERSTONE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES, LLC
This is supposedly a business that has been around since 2005 yet has only had 5 people take the time to even bother with them...

Then as if that wasn't bad enough, I was supposed to only be charged 1,200. for this worthless warranty and when I looked at the contract they finance department had typed it in for 2,000.

I do believe that most people try to do the right thing and I want to believe that car sales places aren't deserving of their reputation as the bottom of the barrel type of sales people, however, this finance department who sold this warranty, surely makes sure that they don't do anything to rid them of their reputation.

So if you want a warranty company for a used car..... my advice is DO NOT buy if from the dealership!

I've called Culver Toyota and got the run around. I called to even find out who had my warranty and they didn't have a clue!........

This is the last review on them I could find:
Kornerstone Administrative Services, LLC 10/31/2014

Review
Anyone that is doing business with this company be aware that if they try to sell you anything from Kornerstone Administrative Services such as an extended service warranty, or Auto Shield Theft Protection don't buy it because it appears to be at least a very questionable business and you will probably regret your purchase. If you have already been taken you can file a complaint with your local BBB, or you can contact the BBB of Utah and file with them since Kornerstone operates out of Salt Lake City. I have already filed a complaint and have been told that if more complaints are filed they will be able to do something about it so others won't be taken advantage of. If getting ripped off upsets you here is your chance to do something about it, with very little effort you can get some action and possibly get your money back. So stand up and defend yourself from questionable business practices.

<review>I just bought a 2015 PriusV from Tito Caceres. This is the second vehicle he has helped me with at Culver City Toyota. He did such a great job the first time that when my life needs changed I came looking for him. MAN did he come through even harder the second time! I got such a a great deal. Tito really hooked it up big time. I can't say enough about this guy, i'll never buy a car from anyone else. He is straight up, honest and knows what you service,the best ever !<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Hands down, best car buying experience I have ever had.  That goes for my husband too.  And, if you are interested in purchasing a new car - there is no one better than Jonathan Sipin.  He was smart and kind and helpful and patient.  Just the BEST.  Along with his manager, Ramona, my husband and I felt like we were in great hands.  And to top it off, Bob Barham was our financial advisor and he went above and beyond.  So, there's your team: JONATHAN SIPIN, RAMONA and BOB BARHAM.  Thank you all!<//text>

I just had a wonderful day, dealing with many kind and professional people in Culver City Toyota. My sales person was Andretti Santiagos, Certified Sales Consultant.
He was AWESOME, kind, experienced, a good listener and driven. I will give his name to any of my friends who wants to purchase a Toyota. Thanks you.

<time>1467330294642</time><rate>5<//rate><Review>During my experience at Culver City Toyota on May 4th, I enjoyed working with Dexter, David and Romonia. I do wish that I was shown the full pricing options of the vehicle and financing if I had wanted to buy it/finance it, along with any discount or rebate offers from Toyota Corp.  I feel that since I was sent to the leasing side when I walked in, I was only offered lease options, and not with FULL disclosure on what my options would be to buy/finance my Prius 3 vs. the leasing of the vehicle. I could be wrong, and maybe I got the deal of a lifetime. I did take the car with no money down and no trade in.
All of this aside, I did enjoy my experience with everyone mentioned above and they were all very respectful in their sales pitches!! =)  Dexter did go beyond what I would expect a salesperson to do to make a sale.  He was off at 3pm but was at the car lot until I finished signing all of my paperwork with David in Finance at 10:15pm. David made the paperwork & finance experience easy-going.  Dexter had my car washed and gassed up, helped me to drive me home and showed me a little bit about my new Prius 3 to get me going.  I drove him back to the lot and his car to drive home at 11pm.  I hope that my experiences continue to be pleasant whenever I visit your location to have questions answered and my vehicle serviced.
Dexter and his team are really great to deal with, and he is the guy that you to work with if you're going thru Internet Sales or otherwise.  He'll go the extra mile for his clients!!  Thanks so much guys!!!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Service dept is not to the standards the service writers dont seem qualified for the job.....consumers inspect your vehicle for the repairs done and ur paper wrk properly before u leave the dealer.....on my vehicles they put wrong oil , the invoice and the oil change sticker didn't match....also I took another vehicle for new remote set up....was ready but with warning lights on the dash.....An o ther visit couple months ago was hopeless visit. Sent my car for service they damaged the air cleaner cover on a 2015 camry . recommended to clean throttle body but no recomendation to replace air cleaner. Not even a check engine light was on to diagnose the issue they recommended.<//Text>

Ok when we bought our car the customer service was great, but when we went back because we had problems with the car the service was frustrating. One day they told us to wait for a manager and after we waited for about 20 mins they came and told us that the manager is on break and we should come back after an hour or so!!! And another time we went for oil change the guy was very rude and disrespectful. 😞</Review>

< review>
The 5 stars is for my sales guy Tito Caceres.
Just bought a 2015 4Runner 4x4 SR5 Premium. Went through an internet search engine to look at all socal Toyota inventory and was contacted by 5-6 dealers.  I spent the next 3 weeks going from dealer to dealer to look at the vehicle they supposedly had in stock. However most of them didn't have the vehicle I asked for and some of them tried to sell me on another vehicle.  The old "bait and switch."  Of course all of them promised me that they could get whatever vehicle I was looking for.

The only person that gave me a straight answer was Tito Caceres from Culver City Toyota. Tito told me the truth even if it meant he would lose the sale.  That's when I knew Tito was the man to handle my transaction. There seems to be a shortage of 4Runners in the socal area, especially 4x4s. I knew nobody in the greater Los Angeles area had what I wanted, so which ever dealer I chose had to work with other dealers to make a trade. Tito over the next month made that happen for me, even when I changed my mine several times about the package or trim I wanted. He was even cool when they brought in a vehicle and I decided I didn't want that one and was able to sell it to someone else.
The guy is a straight shoot and he wont bounce you around to a "closer" or senior manager to close the deal.
At the end of the day, Tito got me the vehicle I wanted at a great price.
He even called me the next day to make sure I was completely happy with my ride.<//review>

Spoke with service rep Shane about ordering a part to repair my Cambry, It has been two weeks and I never heard back from this dealership. During the evaluation of my vehicle my wife and I walked over with intentions to buy a new car. We decided to purchase on our return for service. Needless, to say we never received a call back I was so upset that the customer service was so unresponsive, I drove to Longo Toyota and purchased a new Prius and had my car serviced.
its a shame I had to drive to El Monte to receive the kind of service I expected. This dealership is not worthy of being patronized by our community. I even called the service manager and left a message and again no response. This is so sad!< /review>

<Review>Purchased my Prius from Kai last month, he was upfront, straight forward from the get go. I've submitted a TrueCar inquiry for my Prius package 3, within 15 minutes Kai calls, introduced himself, and offer his assistants and explain how the TrueCar buying program works.  He than ask me which color Prius and what package Prius I was looking for, schedule an appointment for Saturday morning, before I arrived my dream Prius in blizzard pearl was parked outside waiting for me. Met up with him, he took me on a test drive, explains all features and benefits of the Prius and the differences between the different Prius packages, so he can make sure I got that one that best fit to my needs.  After the test drive, came back down to his desk, he show me my TrueCar certificate and price, my TrueCar haggle free price was honored, began my paper work process, finance department Rich Dulay was excellent, he is very funny, whole process took about 2 hours, after words, Kai made sure I was comfortable about my Prius and address and questions and concerns before the left. 3 days later he called and follow up.  Kai was excellent, he made my car buying process the best ever.  I love my new Prius.< /Review>< date>

i had to trade in a car 2014 honda crz and I wanted a toyota rav4, Enrique was able to make the deal work for $699 without disclosure. Enrique the Sales Manager at Toyota in culver city said he made the deal work for $699 a month but didn't disclose how he made it work, I called in over the phone expecting a lease when I got there it became a buy and I asked for maintenance since its a buy and he said he would include maintenance, GAP insurance, and warranty for $22 a month which make 72monthsX$22=$1584. He stated he had to make the deal work but did not give me a sheet or anything showing numbers how it works and said i was having buyers remorse when confronted. I went to dealership to offer to put another $2000 down if they remove the warranty and maintenance which came out to $4000 dollars and $84 a month. Based on my income the debt to income ratio did not line up and the loan to value on the car is 164% so Toyota financial is not looking good to approve the deal. I want to keep the car but because i was not disclosed full pricing of gap, maintenance and warranty i told Enrique to take the items off and rewrite the loan with a higher down payment so the bank can approve it. He was yelling at me the whole time. His coworker Oscar said I should not yell at him even tough he was yelling at me. He stated he would not even make a deal with me and i told him that would have been better than lying to me to sign the deal. Considering my mom's  husband just totaled a Toyota and this is the 5th Toyota purchase for my family i expected an honest person to help me out and i am disappointed and stressed and worried they will come take the car if I don't take their warranty or they won't approve the deal.< /text>

They sold me a car with flat tire, call my sales with no answer.

Fixed the tire from tire store for free. Toyota won’t care about after you purchased car from them. So 1 star.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) If I have Toyota cars they are very good cars and if I buy my first trucks here in this place. But they measured a good deal of money they are like thieves.

I rented a petrol-electric hybrid car in this shop, and still didn't get a car license plate and sticker for a year! I went to the store to find the loan manager and the store manager to negotiate up to 8 times, each time they used different reasons to prevaricate. The sales in this store often change people, and every mouth is full of lotus flowers...so please don't be fooled easily. Because they have a lot of routines! Lie you to buy this to buy that useless thing, and then go out after signing the contract. From now on you will not receive any respect and service! The worst Toyota dealer in the world.

这是一家非常糟糕和流氓的汽车经销商……我在这个店里租赁的一台油电混合动力车，一年过去还是没有得到汽车牌照和贴纸！我去店里找到贷款经理和店长交涉多达8次，他们每次都用不同的理由来搪塞。这个店里的销售经常换人，而且各个口吐莲花满口雌黄……所以请大家不要轻易上当受骗。因为他们套路很多！骗你买这买那没用的东西，然后签完合同出门。从今以后你就得不到任何尊重与服务了！全世界最差的丰田汽车经销商。< /text>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) I took my car to do brake service but they left the valatas of the car unadjusted and they made a very loud noise and I came back to have it fixed and they left it worse and now I had to take my car to another toyota so they will fix it for that reason I do not recommend Toyota of Culver City.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Really disappointed I do not plan to go to that dealer again they offered me. Deliver the vehicle that came with full installation of the stirrups and then they said they will wait for your call, which happened a time and I had to present myself to the dealer and they said that they would not install it since three had passed. And that I could no longer make any claim the managers lie to you the sellers as well as bad on their part tube best experience in toyota dowtow I do not recommend culver city toyota I am very angry with them

(Original)

I que ya no podia hacer ningun reclamo los manager te mienten los vendedores igual que mal de su parte tube mejor experiencia en toyota dowtow no recomiendo a culver city toyota estoy muy enojado con ellos<//Review>< pictures>
