<Review>I've been coming to this vet for 20 years. They have been taking care of my animals. They're are good Doctors. My cat got sick last year and they cured him. Last week my cat got a flu and an eye infection. They gave him an antibiotic shot, respiratory therapy twice a day for 2 days. Also some antibiotics for his eye infection. He's getting better.< /Review><user_name>Black Beard< /user_name><rating>5</rating><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOKkz5UGmhd1-ggo3Nr899B3axenF8lewpwQjL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuV3DzZkFx1UYK8NIo6qhAoQG93KhEBIIwQeiT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Recently after changing my cats litter, I noticed her urinating on my bed when I was gone. I wasn’t sure if something was wrong or if it was the switch of the litter but everyone advised me to go to the vet.
I brought her in this morning and she was taken inside and was told I would receive a phone call from the doctor during the exam. About 45 minutes after they took her in I got a 2 minute phone call from the doctor.. who knows if he even looked at my cat.. he asked what was wrong, I told him and all I was told was it could be a UTI or diabetes, but it’s too early to know. They would have to run tests. That was the extent of my phone call with this vet. No explaining cat behaviors, no explaining possibilities, not addressing the litter change, and randomly throws in diabetes to scare me.
Next the lady comes out with a clipboard that suggests what the vet recommends for my 2 year old cat. If I could upload a picture here I would.. it had the $60 exam fee to even be there, some $350 feline profile, the urine test, the fee to take the urine, the fee to take the blood, hazardous waste, a $109 fluid that would “wash out anything bad in her system”??, and $87 for this antibiotic medicine...
IN TOTAL $763!!!
Because my cat was peeing on my bed?? That is not an uncommon thing at all and not an $800 issue!
Talk about A SCAM! Literally tried to suck any amount of money they could get from me possible! It was insane!
I told him to tell me what I NEED! What do I ACTUALLY NEED?? I ended up paying a $60 exam fee and the antibiotic medicine because that’s the only thing that I could actually get a result out of for today.

I hope it’s just a UTI but all I have to say is be ready for them to suck the money out of your wallet and enjoy your 2 minute phone call with the vet so he can move on to someone else.
Obviously, never coming back or recommending to anyone.< /Review>

<Name>Ana G.</Name><Response>None<//Response><review>Took our puppy here to be seen after she was experiencing mucus in her nose. It was the only place I could find that had an appointment sooner than my normal vet so I was happy she would’ve been seen and treated faster. They didn’t take our pet insurance and I knew it was going to be pricier but I just wanted my puppy to be seen.
Our appointment was at 2:45 pm with the staff giving us an estimate bill and charging us out and saying they wanted to take x-rays of her chest to ensure the infection did not spread.
It had been over 2 hours and she had still not had an x-ray done and when we asked them that we were just going to take her home since they were taking too long.
We were hearing contradicting things about when they were doing our puppy’s X-ray or if it had even been done yet. It was a waste of time taking her there<//review><time>1619653797807< /time>< UserId.>

<resp>None</resp><text>If I could leave a ZERO star I would. This is the 2nd time I visit this place with a scheduled appointment and wait 2 hours. I called as I was outside to get an ETA and they couldn’t even provide that, all they could tell me is what they couldn’t give me accurate timeframes due to the appointment before me. I was the 4:30 appointment and finally left after waiting 2 hours and still haven’t received a call that I’m next. I attempted to call I. For the 2nd time before I left and got a busy tone for 10 minutes. Yet was parked right up front and not one single attendant at the the front desk in the phone. Honestly horrible service and I’m taking my pet business elsewhere. What the heck is the point of an appointment. On biliary with the high volume have enough staff & enough vets to support the service. Specially right after a one year shut down!</text><date>1616810703320<//date><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

In 2016, I brought my first kitten in and purchased the kitten package (which I can not remember how much it was then) and had a great experience, no problems. Fast forward to this year, we decided to take in a 7 week old kitten (Charles) and decided to bring him here since we had a great experience. I purchased the kitten package which was $510. The first problem we encountered was he had diarrhea which we thought was normal due to the vaccinations. However, after the 3rd day we decided to call the doctor and ask if this was normal and they told us to bring him back in. I had to pay an additional charge for the visit and medication for his diarrhea. That night we noticed live tape worms in his diarrhea so I called the doctor back and they told me to bring him in immediately to get an injection which was more money that I paid for. Two days later, Charles had a follow up for his diarrhea which I had to pay for another visit. My husband then had to argue with the doctor for 30 minutes to give him antibiotics which helped with the diarrhea. Now, we are being forced out and they are refunding us only 20% of the kitten package that I paid for and gave me attitude while doing so. With the refund of the package I have probably paid well over $400 in the two and half weeks that I've had Charles. We have to find a vet that will take in Charles with only one set of vaccinations. I am very disappointed in the service. All I wanted was to give Charles a good home and he's had such a horrible experience. Good luck if you choose this place for your pet. I recommend anywhere but here.< /text>

Took my pet in and paid 60$ for them to tell me nothing about my pet except "we need to run diagnostics." Doctor didn't say what was wrong with my pet. All he said was he needs to do more tests. Didn't say if my pets condition is abnormal or urgent. All he provided was the treatment plan of 1,000 dollars. We went in hoping he could tell us if this is an urgent matter or not. Not even that he answered. He suspects my pet to have an infection (i will not disclose for privacy) and told me to just google it!!!!!! I spoke with him for no more than 3 minutes.  He didn't  tell me if my pets vital signs were good, if my pet was a good weight, or if my pet showed obvious signs of distress. Absolutely freaking nothing. He just suggested additional testing. Dont know why all those testing cost 1,000+ dollars but a spay surgery cost less than 100 from other clinics. He suggested surgery already even without tests but in order to be certain abojt surgery, we need more tests. Also refused to share information about my pet because he "needs more tests to give a diagnosis."
Some staff were nice and polite. Some technicians were defensive when confronted about my pets findings. She said "we cant guess for you." All I wanted to know if this was a serious matter or not. I was not given a clear answer. I was not even given any advice to help alleviate my pet's symptoms.
Basically it was like this ->" We don't know whats wrong with your pet until we do a diagnosis. But we suggest surgery, but we can't say that for sure without testing. We can't say if pet is ok or not. We need to do tests. Why do you ask if there's any abnormalities?? I can't say because there's no tests. Why do you ask if it's normal for your pet to experience that? I can't say because I don't have test results. Why do you ask if it's urgent? I can't tell because I need tests."
We only went to this location because they were able to give us an appointment for the next day.
Unless you're rich and have money, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! OR ASK FOR A SECOND OPINION AT LEAST.

The pros: Neat and tidy.
good covid precaution.

I took my puppy for the first vaccines and they almost kill my puppy😡😡😡, trying to get more money they put more shots than the poor Charlie needed and they almost kill it!!! Which is worst,  we went back the following day to let them know and they didn't wanted to take responsibility 😡🤬😡 sending us to a different hospital for emergency, not recommended!!! I will never go back there and will never recommend anybody to take their pets there, they charged us 200 dlls for first shots? And they wanted another 200 dlls just for the Doctor to see it? They are thieves and animal killers!!! All they care is about money, not the animals!!!<//review>

Very bad experience went in because my dog was not feeling well and He didn’t want to eat. My dog only had worms. I ended up with a 600.00 bill. Not good they take advantage of you, because they know you love your pet.< /Review>

I used to like this place but because of the covid 19, we have to wait at the parking area while the staff have to take my cat inside.  I know the Veterinarian employed 5 or 6 Texhnicians and do all the customer service but at least it would be nice for the Vet Doctor to at least look at us from inside and wave his hand to say thank you for your business. Kinda of disappointing to see the Vet doctor giving the service and not showing up and smile at us. Instead he is hiding from each exam rooms.<//text>

<Text>This place has the worst service ever. They are overly priced, the staff is incompetent and rude. If I could give them no stars I would. My poor dog was at this place for an appointment at 4:45, she was not seen till 7:45. According to the staff when asked why is it taking so long didnt we have an appointment. They then stated well yes you did but we had walk ins and we can't turn them away. My dog was last to be seen and the walk ins went before her. That doesn't make any logical sense. We did not leave this place till 10 pm. We kept advising we needed to hurry this up that there is another dog at home who hasn't eaten or been walked. Obviously they did not care because over 5 hours spent at this place is to long. I definitely will not be returning here because they also just want to run up your charges with no itemized billing given to you before they run charges. I asked plenty of times I wanted to see what charges your saying she needs and maybe we can do without some because pay xxxx amount of dollars was not planned especially during these hard times right now. In general with all said DO NOT go to this place.< /Text>< pictures>

<Name>Amber Barnett Traub</Name><Review>We've given this vet many chances, but every visit is as disappointing as the last.

1) Wait is minimum 2 HOURS for even the simplest visits (general exam before spay, deworming, post surgery checks). I had to sit on the floor for an hour and a half today in the exam room before being offered a chair. THREE hours for the post surgery check. The service does no favors, they are not service oriented and do not apologize for the wait proactively.

2) Pricing has consistently been bait and switch. They presented us a quote for deworming that we agreed to, after SPECIFICALLY asking that the quote was for both dogs. When it was time to sign, the quote almost doubled because they said it was for two dogs. Not an anomaly either - for my dog's spay, they quoted me $310 and said that there might be an extra charge if she was in heat. I specifically waited a week to avoid her being in heat, but since they didn't specify the extra charge, I thought it would be nominal. When it came time to pick her up I ended up paying almost $200 extra. If they had been upfront in the first place I could've made a more informed decision.

Their slogan is "our goal is to make your pet happy". That's great but at a certain point you need to whip your service into shape so that the humans are happy too.<//Review>< user_id>

<Review>My dog was sick and needed to be put to sleep. They brought me the papers to sign and i asked them if i could see her before they did it. They said sure they would get her ready. Minutes past then more and I was wondering why it was taking so long. They came back out and asked why i was taking long with the decision i said im waiting for them to come get me to see her before she left me. By the time they went back she was left alone and already passed. 25 MIN TO LATE!!!!
I spent my whole entire life with her and they let her die ALONE because of there unprofessional service lack of communication with the other staff AND LACK OF COMPASSION!!! All they cared about was my CC and paying another 59
I already paid.
My dog died before all the quoted services where performed and I was Refunded NOTHING
DONT TAKE YOUR PETS THERE
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.
I WASNT THERE FOR MY BABY WHEN SHE NEEDED ME AND IM ANGRY AND HURT. THEY NEVER SAID SORRY !!!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>
< review>
Wow, just left this horrible place. First, my dog has a sensitive stomach so vet visits are common unfortunately. My vet was unable to schedule anything until next week. So rather than walk in and possibly wait several hours. I called around to see if another vet had an appointment available for today. I live 5 minutes from the office being reviewed and was told to come on in.

After waiting in the car (Covid 19 precautions) for approximately 30 minutes, they finally came and took my dog. About an hour later they call me and say they wanted to xray and do other "treatments" and gave me a price of $1100. Here's the issue, my dog has a history of stomach issues and just 3 months ago we were at a 24 hour emergency vet with the same symptoms. The 24 hr ER vet offering the same treatments (xray, blood work, meds, etc) charged me half of what Monterey Park was trying to charge me. "How is this possible?" I asked. They responded with, "different vets charge different amounts". Well on this basis, an office open at normal business hours with a customer who made an appointment is charging more than a 24 hour ER vet (I walked into the ER at 2:00am). I would highly recommend that people go elsewhere because they are clearly too expensive.

Lastly, after questioning the price and removing items I felt were unnecessary they still charged me $400 for blood work. Not only that but their attitudes completely changed. They came out and charged my card. Another hour later and they brought my dog. He jumped in the car and they handed me a receipt.  The woman closed my car door and walked away. No information about the blood work or anything. No advice on other things to do as any other vet we've seen would do. Nothing. I assume the blood work will take time but the ER vet had results in under an hour. Overall it was a waste of time and $400 and now I'll still have to take my dog to our normal vet tomorrow or the ER vet tonight if things get worse.< /review>

<Text>Unreasonable charges and fees, and such a rip off.   I asked for a quote of regular vaccine of my dog...three shots and visit fee is more than two hundred dollars.  I went to other place and it cost me only $60 for 3 vaccines and I don't have to pay doctor visit fee if only vaccines are needed.<//Text>< Pics>

She was very kind and answered all my questions and made my cat feel comfortable. She was very nice. The space was clean, a little hairier after we left but they didnt seem to mind. Overall great experience. The staff was nice, was greeted as soon as i walked in and quickly served. They offer many services and the prices are little higher than some other vets i have been to but the service was well worth it.</text>< pictures>

This has got to be the worst place to visit. I wish I would've looked at the reviews before ever taking my dog there. All the bad reviews are correct. My dog died from blood in the abdomen. My regular vet was able to get him stabilized and extend his life for some time. BUT, Monterey Park Animal Hospital said my dog had a respiratory infection. They prescribed breathing treatments and over 300 dollars for unnecessary medication. I knew I had to go to another vet when my dog never improved while I was with MPK Animal hospital. It was ridiculous what they charged, and their diagnosis, which happened inside of 10 minutes, was furthest from the truth. My dog suffered while I was desperate to save him there. Bring your pet here for overcharges, a  misdiagnosis, and a quick death. You have been warned.<//text>

Wow you dumb people who are writing bad reviews about this animal hospital. These people are obviously professionals and trained to take good care of animals, treating them, and giving they're vaccines. I come here all the time and they have awesome services, its great honestly. I've taken my bunnies and 3 cats, they were all well treated and were very responsible and lovely to me and my dad. no matter where you go, your pets medication will obviously always be expensive. People, stop complaining, if you didn't like it then move on somewhere else, just because you didn't like their service it doesn't mean that everyone will think they have bad services too.< /Review>

I had to drop him off early in the morning and was called in the late afternoon that he was ready. After I paid almost $100 for the supposed bath I came to pick off my dog exactly the same way I left him. They did not bathe my dog and when I complained to the manager she insisted that he had been bathed... My dog is white with light brown spots. It is super obvious when he has been bathed. When I tried to complain to the vet who owns the practice she wouldn't even listen. Worse service EVER on top of that it is super expensive and the vets hardly spend anytime with the animals. Every time I went in with my dog the vet barely even touched him they just wanted to charge the $63 examination fee. Do not bring your pets here they will leave a hole in your wallet and not even give your animal the attention that is deserved.</review>< Pictures>

The xray estimate for my cats tail was $570 on top of that. So we waited another 30mins just to pay for pains meds and leave. 1.5hrs of my cat sitting in pain for pain meds from the animal hospital when we just wanted an xray to see what’s wrong< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2cf90a26ec35f:0x31e767735015a586</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

DANGER BEWARE DANGER BEWARE
I. Took my dog to this wretched excuse of a Dr. For what i found out later was a $25 cortisone shot fix for a bee bite.
This horrible human being was playing on my fear and love for my dog to over charge me hundreds and hundreds of dollars .
She wanted to open up my dog just to charge me money.
Thank god i felt her horrible energy and left there to go to another Vet who treated the bee bite with a $25 shot
Stay away from thos disgusting person if u love your pets</Review>

I came here with one of 4 of my pups. This pup was going to be 10 yrs old in August. He had developed suspicious lumps on his back at the site of his rabies vaccine. I let the vet know and he swore it wasn't due to the vaccines. Okay whatever, i stay and listen. They wanted to charge me over a grand for all of his treatment and he refused to give my pup any medication even after he said it was possibly his heart. So he said he would have to special order my pups pills and it wouldn't be more than $100 for the pills i had requested specifically for his heart. They said they would call me to let me know when they got here. A couple days passed and i get tired of waiting for a call so i decide to call. They quoted me $73 for 2 medications and i agreed. That friday I ask my parents to pick the pills up and they quote them $140! Double the price. Well they claimed someone quoted me wrong or they didn't get the price right. We paid for it after a long argument and they promised to have their manager contact me that next saturday. She never called. Now one week later she calls me after my dog passed last Sunday because these idiots didn't know what the hell they were doing! She calls to try to negotiate the price on the pills and when i laughed and told her her call was due a week ago she can't even figure out what to say. I let them know that their careless mistakes killed my dog. I hope everyone does some research before coming here. This office is expensive, rude, and honestly not worth anyone's time. This is the second pup i lose after getting vaccines here. My 10 year old was perfectly healthy before that vaccine visit. His previous vet was amazed how healthy he was. Just do some research before coming here.< /text>

<review>Terrible services! Staff all running around but no customer service. You enter and no one at counter.  One time I had to call from my cell phone to get someone to come out. The prices are outrageous!  There is no dr. On duty until 1030am ...if you can go somewhere else you should....I will never go there again...it's filthy dirty...I have selected another vet to meet my pets needs. It's all about money they get you on meds and other supplies everything is over priced because the dr needs to pay for her Mercedes benz.
Plain and simple THIS IS A  RIP OFF....
High turn over with staff...what does that say about them!!!! Pet grooming takes all day from 830am to 300p...way way to long..I guess they have enough business to where they can refuse to provide service...
But what about the money part? Are they too good to take money?< /review>< Pics>

Heartless Vet!  This Vet should never be even admitted to Vet school!! "Dr. NISHA SANATHARA"

I took in a 10 day old kitten who was on the verge of dying because of infected wounds on the leg.  The Vet came out to the reception desk and told me I don't have an appointment, so she will have to charge me an emergency fee of $70.  This is more expensive than the 24hr emergency clinic  who charges $65 at 3 am in the morning.  I asked for a discount as this is a stray kitten I found in the backyard, and of course, she refused.  Her reason is she has to postpone her surgery for 15 mins and the Vet techs cannot prepare for the next patient and will have to wait for 15 MINS!  Seriously, what harm is it gonna cause to postpone the surgery for 15 MINS??  Calling the client saying that their pet will be 15 mins late to pickup??!!

Okay, fine, I agreed to the $70 emergency fee, and here comes the best part.  After 2 minutes of examination, the Vet said, so this kitten has a 50/50 chance of survival, and 2 deformed legs.  Let me write up a quote for treating it with a shot of antibiotic, and maybe you should consider euthanizing it and I will ALSO GIVE YOU A QUOTE FOR EUTHANIZING IT.  Hello?! If I wanna euthanize it, I would just go to the shelter!!  Pasadena Humane Society has the best facility and very ethical euthanization procedure and it's free!  I cannot believe she still wants to make money either way.  If the kitten has a 50/50 survival rate, why would I pay you to kill it??  Euthanization is for chronic painful disease which the animal will die eventually, such as final stage cancer, you dumb heartless unethical b***h!!!!  So the bill comes out to be $165 at 2 in the afternoon during regular business hour.

PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS VET!!  She not only wants your money, SHE HAS NO HEART!!!  And here is for you, DR. NISHA SANATHARA, if you have no heart and passion for what you are doing, for the sake of all the innocent animals, choose another profession!</review>

(Translated by Google) My dog ​​is about to give birth. I called this hospital. The doctor made an appointment to let me wait for her to go out for a full hour. She came and asked me to pay the dog first to do the X-ray and the B-ultrasound. At first, I thought I would n’t do X-rays when I had a B-mode ultrasound. This would have a lot of radiation for the upcoming dogs, but they answered that they must do it. . You ca n’t leave the hospital after giving birth, but this unscrupulous female veterinarian explained that she had the next appointment. At that time, it was 12:00 noon. I asked for a cesarean delivery immediately after 3:00 pm. The time delivery gave me the opportunity to wait until 5:00 in the afternoon to leave the emergency cesarean section.
The dogs were given a hysteretic injection and they should have been observed in the hospital. They had to let me take the dog back. I was also inexperienced because it was the first time I encountered this kind of situation. Later, when the dog appeared shock in the afternoon, I sent it immediately. Going to another hospital, the doctor immediately rescued my dog ​​by caesarean section. I was in the second weather but I called this hospital to get the dog X-rays and B-mode ultrasound. I did n’t expect them to do X-rays. In order to perfunctory, I just gave me x-rays of other dogs. This X-ray I have confirmed to other hospitals that it is not my dog. This kind of hospital without medical ethics hopes that all Chinese people should never bring their own dogs. They only charge high medical fees and ignore the life of dogs. They are not worthy of being a veterinarian. Not worthy of opening a pet hospital.

我狗狗快要生产，我打电话给这家医院，医生约好时间让我在外等她足足快 l 小时，她来了让我先付钱给狗狗做x光二次正和侧面还做B超，我当初觉得做了B超就不要做x光这对即将生产狗狗会有很大辐射，但他们回答是一定要做，做完后说狗狗怀了只有一胎,让我打催生针.打完催生针是不能离开医院，但这家无良缺医德的女兽医解释她有下个预约，那时是中午12:00我要求下午3:00生不出马上过去剖腹产，他们说没有时间接生让我等到下午5:00生不出去急诊剖腹产。
狗狗打了催生针应该是在医院观察的，她们非要让我带狗狗回去，因为我也是第一次碰到这种情况所以也没经验，后来狗狗在下午时出现休克我马上送到另一家医院，那医生马上剖腹产抢救总算救回我狗狗一条命。我第二天气不过打电话给这家医院要回狗狗X光和B超，没想到他们没有做X光 ，为了敷衍我随便拿其它狗狗的x光给我，.。这个X光我给其他医院确认过不是我狗狗的，这种没有医德医院希望所有华人千万不要带自家狗狗去，他们只为收取高昂医疗费，全不顾狗狗生命，他们不配做兽医更不配开宠物医院.</Text>

Great little restaurant! The staff is really nice! A great variety of complimentary side dishes, probably one of my favorites. This is why I come back. Favorite dish: mushroom tofu soup. Spicy.< /text>

Really good Korean food. The soup is excellent and especially nice when the weather is cold. Lose 1 star because the prices keep going up!</text>

Food is good (portions on the small side). Service is slow if the place is full - I haven't seen it NOT full.< /Text>

I ordered the short rib BBQ.  All I got was 4 tiny pieces of rib and a tiny bowl of tofu soup for $22.99. What a big ripoff!< /Review>

<text>The food was tasteless and bland. I was excited to go but it was a huge disappointment. We literally stopped eating cause it just wasn't good. Also they don't take AMEX...won't be going back.</text>< pics>

<Review>The food was very good with plenty of variety. The waitresses barely spoke English (or chose not to). They were also a bit short and pushy sometimes, but this may add to the atmosphere depending on your point of view.</Review></record>

This is easily my favorite lunch/brunch/dinner spot in Castro valley. It has a really lovely warm atmosphere and the staff is always nothing but friendly. The food is comforting and delicious, consistently. I highly recommend the Dolsot Bibimbap.</text>

Tofu House took me by surprise. The atmosphere is welcoming. The service is ok, but if you every need anything just push the button on your table otherwise you may never see your server lol. The star of the show here for me is their Tofu soup or soondubu. This is one of my favorite soups and they really do it right here. It can be spicy so watch out, although I tend to appreciate that they actually make it that way.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Everything was good except for the price. The staff are friendly and the food is great. It seems to be more delicious than Korean tofu.

가격이 좀 비싼 걸 빼고는 모두 좋았다. 직원도 친절하고 음식도 훌륭하다. 한국 순두부보다 더 맛있는 듯.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Other than Sundae, the food was not very good. Especially Pajeon was the worst of the morsels I ate.

Delicious food and a helpful staff add to the great atmosphere at Ginza where you can get traditional Chinese and Japanese dishes alomgside their more westernized counterparts.

Their menu is massive and all of it is tasty. If you need some libations with your meal there's a full bar as well. I'd go again in a heartbeat, A+</Text>

<text>Great staff with excellent service in a modern day setting with good music overheard. Food is amazing and by far the best sushi in town with a very artistic design on the food, interior, and other aspects of this place. Newer establishment so I would encourage to go during lunch. Was pretty empty.</text>< Pics>

Wow, great prices on happy hour! The portions were large and we enjoyed everything we ordered. Live music is nice but it was too loud to really talk to the others in my group. Service could have been better, had to ask for what I ordered a few times. After that the waitress was good about coming and checking on us.</review>

Pineapple fried rice was excellent and the presentation was beautiful! The decor is very nice and the staff was a little slow, but extremely friendly and accommodating. Once our order was taken, food came out quickly. The best part of my experience was their tempura chicken roll. I don't eat fish, so I'm never able to participate in the sushi festivities, but this delicious roll allowed me to feel like I was having sushi without having to eat fish. Overall it was a great experience, we would definitely recommend and go back.<//Text>

Delicious food. Although the sushi can be better. Such as smaller rolls. The flavor is there but the practicality of sushi is taken away by the sheer size of them. Along with incredible atmosphere and delicious food this restaurant is perfect in every other respect.</Text>

Extremely good detail to the flavor in all of the food we ordered California rolls sashimi and orange chicken lunch special and it was delicious. My eight-year-old is in love with sushi and when we walked in the place the ambience of the decorations the lights he was definitely interested. He said we needed to give this place a review based on the setting alone then when the food came out it was so delicious and mouthwatering that my son again asked me to give a favorable review did I mention he was eight years old?This place is worth every penny for any special occasion I will be going back soon<//review>

Dined here last week.  Wonderful food.  Fun and very efficient waitress.  Paul (mgr.) paid good attention to us.  Went early .
Delightful.  Not too noisy if before the crowd.  Pretty decor.
Going again tonight with our out of town daughter.

It was our first time eating at Ginza and I must say, we were impressed. The sushi rolls were excellent, with the King Crab Dragon Roll being the most delicious sushi roll we had ever tasted. I can't speak for the other dishes they offer, since we only bought sushi, but the Miso soup was delicious and the salad was decent. The only downside was they forgot our rice with our combination plates. Other than that the food was fantastic, and we will definitely be eating here again!</review>

This place is amazing! The atmosphere is great and the waiters are very attentive. We ordered two rolls and some appetizers. Everything was absolutely amazing. The presentation of the food alone is worth the visit. We typically go to Yoshino's but no more this place is going to be our go to sushi spot. I highly recommend you try this place out.< /Text>

<Text>I got a catty experience from a jealous female bartender named Melinda. If you're female don't sit at the bar when Melinda is working. If a man starts giving you any attention Melinda will show attitude to you. All of sudden she won't hear your requests. And if you do ask her for a drink or food she'll get an very angry attitude and serve it to you like she can't wait for you to leave. If a male patron buys you a drink and is showing a real interest to get to know you Melinda will then start touching that man's hand in front of you, make subtle sexual innuendos as she speaks to him, and use overly flirtatious body language like leaning over so her chest is closer to his eyes, and also telling him her days off. The entire evening Melinda didn't show the slightest interest in the men who spoke to me. But once they began to talk to me that's when she became extremely competitive. She put me in a position where I had to either become catty and competitive  or let it go. Since I didn't come come to Ginza to get into cat fight with a barmaid, I let it go. I went to Ginza to have fun. I thought it looked like a nice place with nice people. I was wrong. Instead I had to deal with a female bartender trying to ruin my good time because she felt  catty and competitive. Melinda is an Asian woman, maybe part Filipino, early 30's, and a tad on the full figure side. If you're a woman and you see her know she may attempt to ruin your night out. I won't be returning. I wanted to have a nice time. I don't drive places and spend money to have jealous employees make problems for me. I went to Ginza because I assumed they hired a quality staff. I was wrong.</Text>< Pics>

The waitress was making it a little hard for me to redeem my birthday package.  However Jin came n made everything worth it.  I have never been one to eat, enjoy seafood but this was awesome n Jin made the experience better.  I will definitely be going back n my birthday wish n tempura ice cream n they even sang happy birthday to me.  Overall was awesome.< /review>< Pics>

If I could give no stars I would. We went in on Saturday October 13th around 7pm and the waitress came up to the table, asked us what we would like to drink, my wife asked her if they had the type of tea that's creamy and she responded "we've never had thai tea, I dont even know why you would ask". We will NEVER be back again. We walked out right after<//text>

< Review>
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. I'm new to Fresno and looking for a good sushi restaurant and the service here was appalling. Besides having to wait 10 minutes for the hostess to finish counting receipts to even take my order, the wait time was over long for my actual order and half of it was missing.  I ordered the Bento box and the only thing in the bag was the salad and the entree. Then when I called to fix it, the manager pretty much called me a liar, and then after he conferred with the hostess and she confirmed my order wasn't complete, essentially acted like it would be an inconvenience to correct the error (I just wanted the missing food). It was definitely not the experience I was hoping for.<//Review>

<review>Blah. The loud smooth jazz should have warned us away. The over abundance of menu items hints at mediocrity. The service was okay, the environment was nice although the a/c didn't seem to keep up with the heat leaking doors. Possibly worth the trip for weekday lunch or Sunday rolls, but I'm having a hard time convincing myself to go back to use a $10 gift card.<//review>< Time>

Quality has gone down exponentially. Not sure if they’ve sold to someone else, but I wouldn’t be surprised. Egg drop soup was more cream of corn (not kidding) than broth. I didn’t finish it. Sushi wasn’t fresh and the roll was not consistent. Cilantro at one and and chives on the other? Idek. Husbands kung poa chicken was super oily and portion of rice has been cut into a third of what it was. If we go back it’ll be for nostalgia sake...just disapp< /Text>

<Text>Just got back from lunch with friends - there were 16 of us and the service was phenomenal, thanks to our server, Frank. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the Katsu chicken because my dog, a Japanese Chin, is named Katsu. The tempera sweet potato really hit the spot. I will be back.< /Text>< pictures>

We went here for my birthday and I was excited to take my mom and auntie. We ordered sushi roll (Spicey Girl) b4 our meal and got our meal b4 the sushi roll. Had to bring it to the waiter attention and point to the roll on the counter that had been there at least 10min or more. The sushi chef wasn't busy and didn't brother to bring it to our table either.  Ask to sub rice for salad and waiter blank told us there was a up charge of $3 cuz salad was expensive.REALLY..  I think our waiter was new however not sure cuz he just wasn't on top of his game. Food was tasty however warm. Not hot! Spicey Girl was delicious.
Bento boxes HUGE! GOOD PRICE!
Did have a nice birthday surprise with Deep fried ice cream with the cutest flaming music birthday candle.
I believe manager was concerned about the service cuz kept asking how everything was but didn't want to throw waiter under the bus or let her think we were trying to get a free meal. Need more teamwork, was not busy and it just was so disorganized.  Slow service overall.</Text>

I had the lobster and some temura sushi they call the volcano is was more than enough to eat. I recomend if you do have any concerns to talk to the manager she is more than willing to do what they can to make you happy. Thanks Ginza!< /Text>< user>

Flew out to California from Ohio and stopped by this place a couple times for food, drinks, and liquor. They had everything I needed to make my time here fun! The customer service here was amazing and the guy working the counters at night was very chill and easy to talk to. I will definitely come back next time I’m in California.<//Text>

Knoll's Market is your 1 Stop Shop! They have practically everything you may need at great prices! Knoll's Market has over the years been a lifesaver with their store inventory. They saved my Christmas this year by being open! Thank you Knoll's Market for being our neighbor!< /review>

< Review>
So I ran out of Coffeemate creamer, which is a problem for my morning routine, but I'm reluctant to go to the trouble of running to Target or Albertson's for just creamer. But on the way to the Credit Union I noticed Knolls Market and thought I'd see if they have any Coffeemate. EUREKA! They have it, and in my favorite flavor, and in a good sized jug, not the mini-me version like over at the Waalew gas mart. So I take it up to the counter, the gent rings me up, but when it comes to the credit card processing, he complains about the machine running slow and jokes that if it fails on him again he might start cursing at it. I respond that I know the frustration of tech messing with you. I don't know if it was just friendly conversation, or a distraction, or setting up an alibi. But when I checked my credit card statement he had charged me over $11 for the Coffeemate! The usual price is around $3. I don't believe $11 is Knolls Market's actual price for the creamer. Either the guy goofed and keyed it in wrong by accident (hopefully), or he thought I was too distracted to notice the overcharge, or too rich to miss the money. Well, I noticed, and I'm broke, so being overcharged by $8 is like a sock in the gut. If the owner concedes the error and offers to re-credit my card for the difference, this review will disappear. Until then, I'll feel that I've been robbed. I don't know if he's the owner, but the clerk was a larger guy, bushy brown hair, and a modest beard. Always ask for a receipt and make sure you were charged properly! My purchase was on 3/24/21, probably around 10-11am, and the total was $11.53. Maybe the owner can look up that transaction and verify my story. 1 star above the minimum accounts for them having the Coffemate I needed and being my caffeine savior that morning.<//Review>

This place really is a one stop shop. I have to admit I initially went just to prove the slogan wrong. The staff is super helpful and nice.<//text>

The employee that was like 40 was being very rude and very disrespectful to a 13 yrs old child he wasn't supposed to be talking to a minor he should have came and told me something and he told my son leave the  store very rudely when supposedly he is supposed to treat u with respect so I do not reccomend this store they are not respectful RUDE and don't talk to an adult if their is a problem with a child.<//Review>

Love their snacks but they definitely need to hire more help. The last two times I went I waited 20 minutes for my food. Can't ever go there on my lunch break because I'd be late back to work.< /Review>

Small family owned business. I really love the place and the raspados are delicious. Not like most places where their raspados taste watered down. These are really natural and juicy! They care for their customers and don't just sell you their products.</Text>

<Text>Great service and every instructor I had took great care of me! They taught me everything I need to know to become a safe driver and to pass my drivers test! They are very caring and are determined to help you. I even passed my drivers test knowing their tips and tricks. I now feel confident and comfortable on the road! :)</Text><user>107353448866635517183</user><time>1602286461346<//time>< rating>

Jackie is such a great person, every time I drove with her she always made me feel comfortable & constantly reassured me. She made me feel really prepared for my test, and not even is she a fantastic mentor, she was my friend. It’s so easy to talk to her and she’s very outgoing. Besides Jackie, the entire company itself is amazing as well. They were always so helpful when I needed to set up appointments and you can tell they genuinely care about you and want you to succeed. Its amazing how much effort they put into their jobs.</Review>

< review>
Today was my last drive and I had 2 amazing instructors!! Bob and Richard are the best, if you get them, you’re going to be amazed of how much they care. They were really patient, calm, cool, and very forward on what needed to be worked on and how to do things the correct way. I felt very confident, calm, and happy around these instructors because they knew what they were doing. There’s only 1 instructor I ran into and there was an incident with being stressed and freaked out (not going to say who) but overall this is an amazing place with amazing people and things were fixed!! If you ever come here enjoy every moment because it’s a beautiful feeling to take all the knowledge and practice with you. The quality time spent on a drive is also perfect for a day. Everybody presented themselves in a professional way and a good communicating matter. Like I said today was my last day and this place will be good memories to me, starting was just like yesterday.< /review>

<date>1600559688050< /date><rate>4<//rate><review>Lessons were good. I haven't taken my driving test yet though. I don't think I'm going to pass. I'm feeling really discouraged and not ready. I needed more practice but I don't have anyone to practice with, and tried to get more lessons before my test but there weren't any available. This whole process has been challenging and I'm frustrated that I'm probably not going to pass my driving test after all of this. I've been very tempted to cancel and am surprised I haven't. I'm now looking for lessons at another driving school, to see if they can squeeze me in before my test. I feel extremely discouraged. I want to give up on this now more than ever.</review>< pictures>

<Review>I highly recommend this business for new drivers young and old! The staff is incredibly sweet and helpful in preparing you for the dmv test. It’s no secret that learning to drive can be stressful, the instructors at First Time Driver made this transition easier and more enjoyable!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Jackie is incredibly kind and encouraging when I drive with her. She has always been very supportive and answers all of my questions happily. She is patient with me and I am very confident when we go on drives. I feel prepared and excited for my license test. I recommend her for drive times 100%.<//Review>

<Review>Brenda was a great teacher with adapting to my personality and teaching me step by step everything that I needed to know. She was patient with me and her teaching method was easy for me to learn with. Jackie, my second driving instinct was also very patient with me and she reinforced skills so that I could remember them better. I really liked both of these instructors!</Review>< pics>

Richard was a fantastic instructor and taught me valuable lessons throughout the drive and he was calm and a wonderful person to drive with. He told me what to expect and I'm grateful that I am now much more prepared.<//review>

Everyone is very friendly, making appointments and if you need to reschedule its all very simple and easy. Jackie, my instructor was amazing, always about safety and makes sure you're doing everything properly, would 100% recommend for anyone needing to go through driving school.<//Review>

All of the instructors I drove with were supportive and excellent! Dan started me off with basic driving skills such as making U-turns and stopping correctly. Robert adjusted my hand positioning and worked with my skill in changing lanes. Chuck and Jackie both helped my curb and reverse skills and instructed me on how to pass my driving test! Overall a great experience.<//text>

<text>The classes that you take with Brenda are very well taught, and also exciting classes. She doesn't just teach you how to drive, she actually gives real life experiences. Also the driving instructor are very supportive, I have had Chuck, Robert, and Jackie, and they are all very helpful when you're driving. They make sure you know how to do every individual thing properly to pass the test for your license<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

He is someone who will make you laugh throughout the lesson and won't be too hard on you when you mess up. My second lesson was Robert. Robert was a super great instructor he had me drive on the freeway for the first time and he was very laid back and relaxed which made me laid back and relaxed.

I definitely recommend this company. All of the employees were helpful,  whether it was with actual driving or at the front desk at making an appointment . My instructors were Chuck, Bob, and Jackie. All three of these people gave me helpful hints on what to look for, and taught me all I will need to know. They were laid back and didn't place too much stress on me when we were driving, this made it a lot easier to learn. Thank you First Time Driver!< /Review>

Robert was very helpful in making me comfortable on the freeway and in new areas.
Jackie was great with making sure that I had everything perfect for my driving test.< /Review>

John truly tried to help us learn in class on how to drive and be responsible especially knowing all our traffic signals and what is right and wrong when behind the wheel. As for my four instructors, Robert, chuck, bob, and Jacki, they all did a tremendous job on showing me how to better myself with the driving skills that I was learning. They were patient with me when I made a mistake and caring when I was nervous. I thank everyone at First Time Driver really wanting me to pass my driver's license.<//Review>

John was a really great teacher,he taught our whole class everything we needed to know along with telling us his cool experiences with driving and being a cop.

Robert was a good teacher, he was really good at helping me with parking and backing up in front taking lots.

Dan was really cool, he was really helpful with traffic checks and blind spot check, he is a over all good instructor.

Jackie is really nice and good at teaching curb and reverse, she also helped me learn everything that the Dmv tells you and more, she is a overall great instructor.< /review>

Brenda has taught me all the basics of driving and led me through a safe and educational first behind the wheel drive. Jacki has led me through the rest of my drives behind the wheel and has taught me so much, she has also inspired me and encourages me. They are both amazing women and very great teachers.<//review>

It was great having the four driver instructors, Jacki, Chuck, Dan, and Bob! I was able to learn so many tactics from all their different perspectives and tips that they had given! I feel very confident for my drive test and it's all because of these great teachers, thank you!

Instructors are nice and helpful but the workers in the office that answer calls are the worst! I called them to make an appointment on a Monday then a girl sat me an appointment and said “next Wednesday” she didn’t say this Wednesday or anything. And they came to my house on the same Wednesday and I wasn’t at home and made me pay 30 dollars three times for now ! I highly don’t recommend this driving school because if the staff in the office<//Review>

First time driver was a great class to take, you learn a lot in this class that will help you be a better driver on the road in the future. Honestly this class is a lot better than taking online classes because you learn a lot more and it stick with you and reminds you that what you learn in this class will help you be safe and may even save your life.</review>

<review>I have had 4 instructors all together in my time of driving with first time driver instructors. One of my instructors was John and he is a retired cop and he was a fanaminal teacher and taught me a lot about driving and how to become better and what the license test would be like. And my three driving instructors Bob, Chuck, and Jacki were amazing and have a lot of knowledge and taught me a lot about the road and what can and can't happen on the road. I would really recommend people to go to this place if you want your kid to succeed in driving.</review><Date>1498414120806< /Date>< name>

Probably one of the best dental experiences I've had. Everyone here is real friendly and has good bedside manner. Recently I went in for a root canal and found the experience to be far less intense than I thought it was going to be. But before that work was to be done, I had to get a cleaning. Their hygienist Marie Rand worked on my teeth. What a nice gal, and her bedside manner is top notch. I was receiving a scaling and root cleaning/planing, which kinda hurts. But Marie was real professional and wiped it out in no time. I highly recommend Moorpark Dental Group and plan on continuing to go there.</Text>

Marie is by far the best dental hygienist I have ever gone to. She leaves my teeth and gums squeaky clean. Her meticulous methods of removing the plaque on your teeth are gentle but yet through.  She explains the procedures and reasoning behind them ensuring I am marking an informed decision regarding my care. The office is clean and organized and I am able to book an appointment with Marie later in the afternoon which works best with my work/school schedule.<//text>

< Review>
I have feared and hated going to the dentist and the hygienist for most of my life. I've been going to Moorpark Dental for several years now and I am no longer afraid. Marie Rand is the best hygienist I have ever had! She is gentle, thorough and very personable! My teeth and gums are healthier than they have ever been thanks to her!</Review>

Had a great experience hear. All the team was friendly, helped explained all procedures that were being done to me, why I was getting poked and all. I've never had that before and I greatly appreciate it. Hygienist Sahar was great, really friendly, answered any and all my question made me feel comfortable when I usually feel nervous when going to the dentist.</Text>

I just had my first appointment, I always get nervous to go to a dentist. The front office was easy to schedule an appointment, the office was clean  and the staff was friendly. The doctor was professional and showed great expertise. They made my experience very comfortable.<//text>

<user>117941301914365301669<//user><response>None</response><username>Bruce Leena</username><review>When I went to the Moorepark dental. The place seemed very clean and the staff was nice. What I didn't care for was that they are VERY sneaky about prices and testing that you clearly didn't ask for and said no for. My insurance paid my teeth cleaning, but apparently they slipped in some bonus stuff that I thought was covered and they stuck me with the bill. During the pandemic, losing both of my parents back to back. I didn't have a lot of money thrown around. I am no longer going to them. The bonus,  the woman who did my cleaning was nice, but she needed to be more careful. I not only got my tooth removed and the shots are painful, but she hit me in the head with the light and Iater got a big knot on my head. I left that place in tears. I accepted it as an accident, but still. Didn't make my visit happy and then I get stuck with a bill I didn't know I had. I think its a bit dishonest for my taste. I am going elsewhere.<//review>< pics>

I don’t go to the dentist often but I received a cleaning from Sahar Faal and she was professional and made me feel comfortable. We had a great conversation and I look forward to talking to her again!

I had a great visit with both dentist and Hygienist. The staff as well was very nice and efficient. Sahar Fanal is the Hygienist. She is honest and does great work. My cleaning was very thorough and she made sure to communicate with me every step. I would strongly recommend Moorpark Dental Group for your next visit.< /review>

<text>I came in for an emergency dental abscess. The front office staff was very friendly and empathetic to my situation. The office is immaculate and all the equipment is modern. Dr Huss and Dr Pena took great care of me on my first visit. Friendly and fast. When I came back for a check up, the same staff was still just as cheerful. Dr Huss examined the previous work and did a complete check up of my other teeth. Turned out I needed a deep cleaning, which to my astonishment, they were willing to do right then and there. I was then introduced to Dr Faal, the in house hygienist. She was equally nice and knowledgeable. I have felt incredibly comfortable with my visits to this office. They explain everything very clearly with a bright smile (even behind the masks, you can tell they’re happy to help!). If you’re searching for dentists, give this office a try. I’m happy to be a patient of Moorpark Dental Group.< /text><user>101961316619302101001</user></record></dataset><record>

Dr Castillo and his assistant are sublime, professional workers. They pay attention to detail, and they are receptive when you talk. I have a very sensitive gag reflex, and they for once payed attention to that, other dentistry’s just try to make you tough it out, however not this practice. They gave me topical numbing solution diluted with water and numbed my throat so that I wouldn’t gag during the x-ray and it solved the problem. They were professional and kind throughout the whole procedure, Dr. Castillo even took extra time shaping my tooth making sure that it sits perfectly when I bite. Now, let me tell you about their dental hygienist, her name is SAHAR FAAL. She is unmistakably the best hygienist I have had in a long time, she is charming, on point, she makes you feel comfortable, and she is fast. She educates you about your own teeth to help you prevent future challenges with a smile. She asked me what music I like, and then played what catered to my needs and thoroughly cleaned my teeth In a fashion where I have no cuts nor bruises after the procedure. Here’s the kicker, she gave me two anesthesia shots and I didn’t even feel it. That is correct, she is a sharp shooter and she knows the skill of the trade. She is an exponentially talented individual who can match the mission statement of any business. Their workforce and management are streamline, professional and passionate about their work. This is a gem of a business I add my seal of approval to it.</Review>

<review>First and foremost I have to say that this is by far, the best dentist office I have ever been to in 50 years of life! From the front desk, to the assistants, and so on! Every time I go it gets better. I had a crown fall out and the kindest dentist I've ever met, Dr. Huss, did not trick me into getting a new crown! He instead, was honest and told me that it was still good and put it back in, saving me thousands! Then I received the most fantastic cleaning ever by the most hip and amazing dental hygienist, Sahar, who made me laugh and played my favorite music! Again... best cleaning I ever had and was super sensitive to my finances ensuring that I got EVERYTHING I NEEDED, plus some! Finally, Dr. Molayen (periodontist) fixed my gums and my teeth feel 20 years younger. I was about to lose some teeth but he performed surgery on my entire mouth on the same day I went in because my insurance was fixing to expire! The sweet front office staff worked with me, yet again, making it doable by getting my insurance on board to take care of me that day, then included several visits after, on the house! I can't speak enough about these people! I'd rather pay cash out of pocket, then go anywhere else! Special shout out to Jorge who ever so kindly got me all set up. He took time out to do me a couple favors. Dr Castillo is just as wonderful, along with his adorable assistant Natalie! I wish I could remember everyone's name but all you need to do is remember MOORPARK DENTAL  GROUP! THERE IS NOT A FLAW IN THAT BUSINESS!< /review>< user_id>

<Text>Friendly and helpful staff. Dental hygienists Marie (on sick leave) and now Sahar, have both been wonderful. I've had two visits with Sahar this year and she always has some useful tips for me to improve my dental hygiene, such as letting the electric toothbrush do all the work and to brush at a 45 degree angle.</Text>< rate>

I had a deep cleaning with specialist Sahar Faal. She took great care of my teeth, reviewing everything she was going to do in great detail prior to the service so I would be well informed and prepared.  She even allowed me to play favorite music during the whole service.  It’s little things like things that make a difference from a regular service to a amazing one.  Thanks so much Sahar for helping me to have a  brighter smile I am looking forward to my next visit.<//Text>

<Review>Went over here in Feb March to get one issue fixed and doc suggested so many other things which is still fine. But when we asked to just get primary issue fixed first and with a simpler option instead of their suggested 9-10 times costlier option these people didn't even care to schedule something till date for me. These people won't take care of the simple issue unless I am ready to spend thousands. Even the service on my first and only visit was pretty bad, they do not care about people time.< /Review><response>None<//response>< user_id>

I’ve been nervous to visit a dental office since COVID started. I was due for my yearly cleaning this past March, but instead opted to pass. The year is about to end and I can feel all the gunk, plaque and late night snack snacking remnants hanging around. Sahar, the registered dental hygienist recommended her place of work and told me that she herself would have family come here. Knowing that she takes every precaution, is very clean and professional I felt safe coming here. Sahar made time fly by as she was cleaning my teeth she educated me about my dental health and how to prevent and cavities and maintain proper hygiene. My sister and I both had our teeth cleaned by Sahar. I would never tell my own sister to come if I felt this place wasn’t practicing safe measures. I trust Sahar and know that her experience, professionalism and love for what she does makes Moorpark Dental the place for my family and I.<//text>

So, this was my first time coming to this office, and what can I say! great place. I came in to get CBCT scan for a future implant, and the wait time was short and sweet. I was greeted in a kind and timely manner, they took care of me so fast. The front desk was on point with my insurance benefits, the assistant Jesus was fast and efficient with the scan, and I had some questions about a dental cleaning. So the front desk personnel asked the hygienist Sahar to answer my questions. So when she came out, she was very comforting, and really great. She answered all my questions about what kind of cleaning I need, and why. She was very formative and professional. A true gem. I am so happy that she was able to give me the best care possible and attend to my hygiene needs. I cant wait to come back for my implant and my hygiene appointment. Even the other patients in the waiting room were raving about her. Dr. Huss and his team are amazing, and they truly know how to educate patients and treat them with dignity and care.  Thank You Moorpark Dental. I can't wait to come back again for treatment!!!!!!!!!!- Fred<//Text>

My girls go there. My youngest one had several cavities and she is very afraid of the dentists it is almost like a phobia. She freaks out even during a regular checkup. Dr Castillo had a lot of patience and was very gentile with her and was able to do several fillings! He is very good! The waiting period of time is very short and the stuff is nice!</review>

Before I start it is so important to know that this dental office is open now and serving all types of needs. They take every precaution and enforce social distancing. You can be confident your safety is their first priority.

Dr. Huss,
Thank you for your team. This group of people truly define what it means to be a team. I haven’t been the most pleasant patient to deal with on several occasions due to discomfort and bone spurs. What truly sets you all apart is that you all handled it with care and compassion and at the end of each visit I felt grateful for having went. I even had work done by you on one occasion and that speaks a ton for your character as a leader. Thank you.

Dr. Castillo,
This is arguably one of the most patient guys I’ve ever encountered. Although, I have not had but one visit with him I look forward to getting my teeth and gums back in order. He is an outstanding member of your team and I appreciate the approach he takes with patients. Thank you Dr. Castillo.

Dr. Yafai,
He is the Oral Surgeon here and this guys is a next level black belt when it comes to what he does. He remembers you even after first meeting you a month prior. Impressive. He is very good at what he does. I had a tooth extracted and could’ve fallen asleep on the table during the process. It was really the best extraction I could’ve hoped for. The staff who have seen my mouth since his visit have all said how well the site healed over and that is a small testament to his work. Thank you.

Sahar F. is one of the Registered Dental Hygienists at Moorpark Dental Group. I had my first visit with her 6/25. We started the visit by me expressing my ridiculous fear of dentists. She handled that in a way that immediately made my worries vanish. Her witty reply instantly changed my mind toward the positive. Go ahead, book an appointment yourself and call her a Dentist. You’ll see. Throughout the appointment I continued to be impressed by her precision, her control and her ability to continuously ease my mind in an uncomfortable situation.
At one point and several times thereafter I even noticed her sharpen her various precision dental picks. Let me tell you why this matters. Sharpening any instrument is a skill that is acquired and in order to be successful at it you must practice an awful lot. Many professionals will ship this task out to others, but the ones that take the time to develop this skill themselves are exceptional when using their instruments to perform their craft. You can tell the difference immediately. Sahar, Thank you for being an amazing example of a true professional. Your service based heart and the way you care for yourself is reflected In the way you treat your patients. I highly recommend you book that next deep cleaning with her. You will not regret this.

Last but certainly not least, Miguelina.  Miguelina, is an amazing asset to this team as well. She is always concerned for your comfort and wellbeing as a patient and has an amazing memory. I promise, you will feel like she knows every single persons name who goes through that doorway. You will feel welcomed and like a VIP every time you encounter her. First impressions of a place often tend to be flat and generic. The bar for what to expect from a Dental office was definitely raised as a result of her. I wish you guys nothing but success for many years to come. Thank you for all you have done and will do for me.

I’ve been seeing Dr. Huss ya MDG for over 3 years now. They always get me in right away and make the process as quick as possible.
My last visit unfortunately happened in the middle of the COVID pandemic, I had to have an emergency extraction and Dr. Huss and his staff did their best to make sure I understood what was happening and that I would be okay even though it hurt now.
The icing on the cake was the call I received from Dr. Huss a week later checking in on me. I work in health care and it’s always comforting to know that there are doctors out there that truly care about their patients. I will continue to come to Dr.Huss and MDG for all of my oral care needs (hopefully, not an emergency next time)<//review>

< review>
I am from Chicago but my wife is from California. She convinced me to go see Dr. Hoyle, as she said he was the architect of the mouth. I didn't know what that meant, but when my wife says to go I usually go. I was pleasantly surprised. I had 2 crowns put in and 3 hours later I was done. I have not had any problems at all. I mean no one goes to the dentist to have fun but given the situation it was relatively painless. I didn't have insurance in CA, so they helped me with a payment plan. I would gladly go back and I highly recommend them. Thanks guys.<//review>

<review>BUYER BEWARE--They bait and switch you from an offer too good to be true, for a plan so expensive, you'll need financing or to break into your emergency savings to pay for it.

I moved to Moorpark  in 2015 and was way overdue for my routine six-month cleaning and check-up, but since this has been an aberration in my overall adult life of dental healthcare maintenance, I was surprised with the first-time new-patient examination findings.

I went to the clinic thinking this was a great deal--an exam, x-rays, and a cleaning for a low price of $59.00.   Their disclaimer that you only get the cleaning if you don't have periodontal disease didn't concern me, as I was confident that didn't apply to me.   A simple ordinary tell-tale sign is my gums don't bleed when I floss, which is daily, no less than once a day, though often more often, to remove any food stuck between my teeth.

The x-rays were a cheap quality and type, and several of the tooth images didn't come out and so the technician kept repeating them, giving me more radiation exposure each time, and until I realized this was a chronic issue with either the machine or the software.   At first I was very cooperative and flexible.  But when it became several times where the machine wouldn't perform, I lost faith in the equipment they were using and in their process.

Then I got the exam from the dentist, who was very cordial and friendly and made great small talk.   He said all my crowns, and fillings looked fine.   He told me what I knew, about my receding gum lines, something I was aware of and have always been told can be managed with good oral hygiene and diet.  But then he told me the bad news.   I had severe periodontal disease so I couldn't get the cleaning I had come in to receive.   The dentist said I needed laser cleaning and resurfacing  or planing, or something like that--a procedure that would cost me thousands of dollars.    Then then handed me off to their financing and scheduling plan coordinator.

I was upset and said thanks but no thanks and I got a second opinion from another dentist in town.

I needed a cleaning, and I welcomed a real exam and set of x-rays that were clear and complete.

It is my personal opinion that Moorpark Dental Group and Orthodontics is a scam.  I feel I got ripped-off  with their bait and switch from an offer for a very inexpensive exam, x-rays and a cleaning for a price too good to be true, to reel me into a very expensive and questionable treatment I didn't want or need.

BUYER BEWARE!   If they tell you you need their laser treatment for periodontal disease, hold onto your wallet and go get a second opinion.  I feel really ripped off.   I want my money back.</review>< rate>

< Review>
This is a great place all around. I've been seeing Dr. Huss for a few years now. He also sees my 4 kids. He has a great sense of humor and makes you feel comfortable, and my kids don't dread going to the dentist. Dr. Huss gives the best care and is passionate about what he does.  It's refreshing. He is so informed and up-to-date on new procedures too. The staff is very helpful and friendly as well - not pushy at all. Also, two of my kids have braces and it's so convenient to have a good orthodontist in the same office.< /Review>

Dr. Magdos  was not only the nicest Dentist that I have ever been to but she was gentle and listened to all of my concerns also. She explained everything thoroughly to me, the prices were better than any office I've been to and she didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need. She was very fair and made me very comfortable. The entire office was  fantastic! I know I can trust my dental care to Dr. Magdos. Five stars to everyone at Moorpark Dental Group, I would have given them 10 if I could! I can now say I look forward to going to the dentist.<//text><GmapID>0x80e82dddf5287695:0x17f22049d401d9e5< /GmapID></record>

I also notice that the supervisor did not bother to get involved until I told them I was going somewhere else.

<review>Under new ownership and this was one of the best experience I have had ever. Dr. Huss and the entire team took care of me and my family. I always check reviews and I normally always look for the worst first. In this case appears that many of those bad reviews were from years ago and not Dr Huss.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>High-Pressure sales, long wait time, and a staff that refuses to listen to what you want and need. Like many other reviewers, I was basically hustled. I went in to get some work done. Did I get anything done? No, I just spent an hour on my back listening to sales pitches about how I needed to spend at least several thousand dollars, when my last dentist only charged me a few hundred for the exact same thing. They basically tried to scare me into handing them my check-book, and diagnosed me with several new diseases, each of which will cost hundreds and thousands of dollars to treat. Funny how the dentists I saw right before this and right after this missed all that.< /review>< gmapID>

My fiancé and I ordered from here today. The food was literally tasteless. My mahi was extremely dry, as well my fiancé’s chicken. He didn’t even order chicken. He ordered the chico burrito which was supposed to be beef and chorizo.

Extremely disappointing.< /Text>

< review>
update- received a quick kind reply to my review with a great suggestion- thanks guys!
Some dishes are good, the chicken salad was yummy.. The grilled fish tacos were super salty, twice we've had them. I'm guessing they're pre-seasoned when sent out to the locations. otherwise its worth a try for sure.</review>

This is one of the challenges of having an older building and facility. But one thing is for certain our staff cleans thoroughly and diligently every single day. Which is why we regularly pass inspection by VCRMA and are in great standing with them. I am sorry to here about your experience regarding your food and agree that something should have been done to make this right. Our supervisors are trained to handle this sort accident or mistake. Did you ask for a supervisor or to have new tacos made? I just want to make sure I fully understand what occurred and make sure you were not refused new tacos when you requested them. I am surprised to here that nothing really tasted right as this is highly unusual. It would be good to know what day and time this ocurred. I would love to have another opprrtunity to earn your business back. Would you be willing to call our GM M-F between 10 am and 4 pm, I will have a gift certificate for two free meals waiting for you and I am sure the GM would like any additional feed back you would care to give. Thanks again for your feedback we will use it to do all we can to improve our restaurant as we approach nearly 30 years in Business in Simi Valley.'}</Response><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>2<//Rate><Review>This will be my last visit to Chuys east, but I still love Chuys west. The place does not appear very clean. The table was sticky. The food however was not appetizing at all. The chicken in the tacos was completely dry and the avocado was not ripe. The tri-tip on the sandwich most of the meat slid out before getting to the table and tasted odd. The fries were delicious though. When the server delivered the food to the table one of the food baskets was sitting right on top of the tacos. When she set it down the avocado, sauce and a piece of chicken was stuck to the bottom of one tray. Which then the chicken fell onto my lap along with some sauce. At no time did the waitress see this. Even as she set the tray down with a huge chunk of avocado stuck to it. She finally noticed when I lifted the tray to remove the avocado. Then she looked at the tacos and noticed that the avocado was missing. Now she did apologize and went to bring more avocado, but did not replace those tacos or compensate us for any of that.

Now I do understand accidents do happen, but they need to make it right. I'm sorry it is disgusting to have a tray that sits on counters sit on top of our food. I do wish we had taken a picture of it, but did not think about it until later.<//Review></record>

I used to love this place. It was my preferred location of Chuy's in Simi.
They still serve great Chuy's food, but the service is piss poor.
Go to Chuy's West for friendly service.<//text>

Poor quality food and servers who don't wash their hands. Boxed a to go order with the same dirty hands that scratched his face and hair, pulled a trash can in from outside,  bused a table,  took money,  made drinks... Never touched a drop of soap or water,  and I'm supposed to want to eat that. Go somewhere else,  anywhere else!!</Text>

Everytime I come to this chuys they disappoint and the food is bad. My Mahi Mahi taco smelt. The one off of L.A. and erringer is so much better. I'll drive further than go to that one again. Also the Ceasar dressing smells I hope I don't get sick.< /text>

<Review>Front desk reception was indifferent. I was a bit late and forgot my mask. Asked for one at the desk - no masks! They sent me next door to Walgreens to buy one. My local welding supply outlet keeps spare masks on hand, I’d expect as much from a medical testing facility. Technician was friendly, welcoming and terrific.< /Review>< Name>

Very small place compared to Daly City.  Lighting is gloomy and lack of energy.
Staff is friendly and accommodating which is good.  It is convenient for working people and people depend on public transit. I personally prefer the Daly City property with bright lights and energy.  And top it off, look very clean which is a good sign.< /Review>

This place was pretty decent. I was in and out in less than an hour. The best part was not having to dress down and put on a medical gown just to do the MRI like Kaiser makes you do. Everybody was really nice here.<//review>

Both times, the technicians was extremely professional and courteous. I was early for my appointment and they managed to slide me in without waiting. On top of that, with my insurance I feel the cost of the procedure was quite reasonable. There are also many locations across the peninsula, so if you are in SF and need medical imaging, be sure to give them a try.< /Review><Name>Gregory Clift</Name>< resp>

<text>I was given a date for a CT scan I arrived and I was told they don't do CT scans on that day so I had to turn around and drive back home My appointment was in the city of San Francisco and I don't live in San Francisco.
My second experience was them rescheduling my CT at a time that would not normally have worked but luckily there was still a CT technician available at the end of the day to provide me with my CT.  Wjo ever is doing the scheduling needs to monitored or retrained.  It will never be a choice of imaging nor will I ever refer anyone.  Commute, toll free and parking was a cost of 25 dollars each day. The facilities were fine.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1617116872821, 'text': 'Hello Jesse, we apologize for the negative experience.

Once I physically arrived at the location it was surprisingly smooth. However, everything leading up to that point was a complete nightmare. The website was an incredibly painful clustermuck. Could not get any info on scheduling until account created but creating the account was impossible for some reason. Chat feature completely useless and reaching anyone by phone took more than three tries at a hold time of over 20 minutes EACH time! One of those times I was on hold (over 20 minutes), woman answered and said to hold, DISCONNECTED me and I was put at the end of the queue again! Totally unacceptable service via phone AND website. Wild goose chase nightmare. I would recommend having your dr. office make the appt and just show up. 😡</Review>

If you are claustrophobic, this place is for you.  These are the most caring, patient, accommodating MRI specialist in San Francisco.  Don’t waste time going anywhere else.  There is no waiting and they are very professional and efficient.  You can’t ask for more than that.<//Text>

Another man complained  that he waited 20 minutes and still had to wait more.    There were too many people in the waiting roo., some were standing.   There was a moving crew there and one on the movers  had his mask on below  his nose inside of the building.    The staff were nice and my ct scan was fine.</Review>< resp>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>They offer walks in from 8:00AM to 4:00pm, so it was disappointing to learn that the technician had left at noon and I had just wasted my time. They did this at both locations at different days.
This lack of reliability should be a red flag to anyone trusting this place with using them to diagnose or monitor the challenges you are going through.<//Review></record>

Well the check in process went quickly and I was seen by the nurse within 10 minutes
As I exited however the lobby was surprisingly packed so I guess that I was was quite fortunate unlike the others who were bunched up. I would strongly recommend that you stagger the appointments a little better to provide a safe environment & a temperature check wouldn’t hurt< /Review>

I was left sitting in the waiting room for 45 minutes. Nobody warned me they were running behind. And nobody came to check on me with the exception of someone asking if I was waiting for an ultra sound. No apology for running late either.< /text>

I went in for a mid-morning appointment for a hip X-ray. The lobby was understaffed. The one receptionist was pleasant and helpful. About the lobby, it was not marked out for social distancing at all. We need help to remember! On the second floor was where we were to have our X-ray performed. An unkept place. The technician to administer the procedure, Jolene I believe her name was, was professional thoughtful and kind. She was the bright light!

Over all, not a horrible experience. The business just needs a tweak hear an there! And the X-ray image, the reason I was there, came out without a hitch. I was in and out in about 20 to 30 minutes< /Text>

DO NOT GO THERE
They will steal your money
They gave us an estimate of $417 for an MRI, which we paid the day of the service.
A few weeks later, we received a bill for $900... We've been disputing that with them for weeks, they won't hear it, saying that the $417 was "JUST AN ESTIMATE", how can you not know how much a service that you do on a daily basis will cost? Especially since they are in charge of doing a pre-authorization with my insurance. I could understand a price discrepancy of a few dollars, not MORE THAN DOUBLE.
It's outrageous...
Like I said I contacted them without any success. I'm now contacting my insurance, we will see if they solve that problem.
If not I think it won't be hard to find people that want to sue them, because it looks like they are accustomed to steal from everybody.
Checkout their 2* YELP reviews!

EDIT: Despite saying that they'll reach out to me shortly, they never did. And I still receive phone calls that ask me to pay.</review>

The place is clean. The people who work there are nice. The Technologist that took me back for my test was very helpful. I can be a bit claustrophobic, so he told me how long each film site would take. That was very thoughtful and appreciated.  I gave it 4-stars because I was not told I would need to park in a paid street garage because street parking is very sparse<//review>

<text>I went recently to this location and had an awful experience. The radiology technician was rude from the beginning to end of the appointment. The technician made comments such as “stop breathing so hard” and yelled at me saying that what I was doing was wrong but never gave me instructions. I left with an awful bruise since he would snap the rubber band against my skin at least six times and when he put the needle, he kept moving it around to find a vein. My bruise is awful, and I rarely bruise. I filed a complaint and never was contacted when told that the Compliance Board would reach me. I hope this does not happen to anybody else.</text>< gmap_id>

< review>
Super friendly and competent staff, modern and clean office, kind and knowledgeable MRI technicians who do everything to make patients feel 100% comfortable. Great service. My doctor had my MRI results just a few hours later. I liked the experience at the San Francisco downtown location a lot.
The central SimonMed scheduling phone service is fairly bad and the SimonMed phone system is misleading (suggesting to visit a location in Arizona! to obtain medical records)  I suggest calling the San Francisco location directly. They are super friendly.<//review>

Both Post and Sacramento offices have minimal COVID-19 safety protocols. If you’re in a high risk group I would avoid going there. Customer service is terrible with incorrect information and long wait times. Do not recommend and hope I don’t need to use them again.< /text>

<text>I got a call from SimonMed saying my doctor had contacted them for an examination. After scheduling an appointment with someone over the phone I verified the location I was supposed to go to twice since I knew there were multiple locations. I was told to go to the Post street location.

Prior to my appointment, I decided to call again to get an estimate of cost for the procedure after reading terrible reviews about billing. After getting transferred to their billing department, I was put on hold for 35mins before speaking to anyone. They did give me an accurate bill amount but we will see if I’m charged more later.

The day of my appointment I show up to the Post Street location only to find out my appointment was at the other location, which happened to be the direction I just came from!

Luckily I got there early enough for me to get to my appointment on time but mistakes like this shouldn’t be made especially since I verified the location before. When I arrived the lady acted very annoyed because I didn’t have a printed referral from my doctor even though I never received one since he contacted them directly.

I am already expecting to pay additional money for hidden fees due to the shadiness of this place. Fingers crossed that doesn’t actually happen.<//text>< username>

So thankful that SimonMed was able to get my MRI done quickly and at a reasonable price. I called late on a Friday afternoon, and Eugene was incredibly helpful in getting me set up with an appointment less than 48 hours later... on a Sunday! This blew my mind and really made my day because I had spent the entire previous week playing phone tag with another imaging center and got nowhere.

I found the clinic itself to be a very clean and pleasant environment, and all of the staff friendly, kind and professional. Results were provided within a few days, and I couldn't be more thankful!</review>

< Review>
My first impression was a good one since THEY called ME to schedule my MRI after my doctor ordered one. I took an evening appointment, 7:30pm, and arrived to a completely empty waiting room. Reception staff and technician were extremely personable and had quick, clear answers to all of my questions. I was seen before my scheduled appointment time, and even with a 45-min MRI, was out of there in a little over an hour. Great experience!< /Review>

I had appointment at 3 pm and check in time was at 2:30 pm. They made me wait about 4 hours to check MRI. Horrible horrible experience. After waited about 2 hours I asked them what's going on. They sayd on of the technician left or something and offered me reschedule but I already waited 2 hours so I continue wait 2 more hours. Choose something better than this place.< /review>

Getting a mammogram is scary but the radiologist who worked with me is, I am pretty sure, the kindest most calming person on the planet!</review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Text>Once I got in the experience was good and professional.  The problem was I was told to get there at 6:00 AM to do the paperwork for my 6:30 MRI.  Doors locked and lights off. Called no answer.  Homeless people sleeping in doorways around and street and sidewalks not very clean.  Waited 25 minutes and eventually 2 employees arrived. They said they had a problem with the key box and needed to get another key but left no note. When they arrived and I started filling out the paperwork they said they did not receive the prescription from the doctor. Luckily I was on a 15 minute hold with the company who helped make the reservation.  They came back on and had the prescription.  From that point all went well and I got my MRI done. They gave me a DVD of my scan. They no longer validate parking against previous reviews, so that was an $18 expense.<//Text>< pictures>

Don't get your X-Ray here.  The estimates they give you are incorrect, because they prioritize CT scans over X-Rays.  Only after I had complained repeatedly did the tech do my X-Ray at the same time as a CT scan next door, something they could have easily done an hour earlier.</Text>

<Text>1.  Train your staff to lift their heads, smile, and greet the customer when they arrive.  I was ignored until I spoke up.
2. Tell you customer how long the wait is going to be, especially customers who booked appointments and are made to wait 45 minutes or more for service.  Yes, we have other appointments already scheduled, following our time with you, and we don’t like to be late.
3.  Train your staff how to pronounce names.  Your staff completely mangled my name twice and giggled twice.   Perhaps they could ask us how to pronounced our names please?
4. Do not admit your patients to the back room and put them into that huge CAT scan machine if you still don’t understand what procedure you’re supposed to be doing for them.

Overall, whoever manages your SF office should be fired.   But they won’t be, because in America, knuckleheads are never accountable for ANYTHING!!!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< username>

I tried to call the Post location asking for the current wait time for an X-ray and Serena kept putting me on hold. After three 5 min holds of me calling back she condescendingly told me I should go to the Sacramento location. Sacramento location was nice and helpful. The two stars reflects serena’s lack of customer service.< /Text>

<text>DO NOT GO HERE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Believe the reviews that talk about the nightmare you will experience with their billing.

I have been fraudulently billed for an item that was never ordered or performed, and for items that were performed they never sent a claim to my insurance company even though they said they had. Even though I have called to dispute this, the company has decided to send the bill to a debt collector to chase me down.

I have now had to sought the help of a third party to file a complaint and help resolve this issue.</text>< pictures>

<review>when i finally got it done, the technician was great but it took 4 visits to actually get the x-ray to occur.  the first because they shut down well before the advertised walk in time; the next because the technician doesn’t arrive until well after the opening time; another because the call in service wasn’t aware of team/machine outages on the ground, etc. don’t believe suggestions that this is a easy walk in service - call to confirm the time you intend to go by and have the operator check with the local facility while you wait on hold to make sure that they’re offering the advertised service you’re after.< /review>< response>

I noted to the individual at the desk that I didn’t find the TV content very appropriate for people with traumatic injuries.  It took several requests before he reluctantly agreed to change the channel.
The MRI technician seemed competent, if completely uncaring. When I noted that I’d like to use the restroom prior to the MRI, he told me “it’ll only take 15 minutes, but suit yourself”. When I asked for a blanket because I was shivering, he said “just let me finish my process.”  Overall, the people I dealt with had zero interest in me. I hope they did a better job technically.< /text>< pics>

<text>I went in for a rather expensive procedure (an ultrasound) and they informed me the day before of the cost and that it wouldn't be covered at all by insurance.  This sucked, but wasn't their fault.  I paid at the office.

However, I then received a bill from them 4 MONTHS LATER saying that I had a past due balance that was more than their "estimate".  Apparently, they just adjust prices after-the-fact in order to fleece their customers.  They are now "investigating my case", but I'm not optimistic...< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Called to schedule appointment and gave insurance information. Got a message the next day stating the cost of around $500, which was double of what my insurance quoted.

- I called and they stated that's what insurance cost came up as.
- I asked if I could pay out of pocket. Sure that's $220
- I go to my appointment and out of pocket cost was $520
- Called insurance, they said pre-authorization was correct, SimonMed gave wrong amount
- Called SimonMed again oh yeah! we gave you the wrong number, it's actually $220

At that point got the appointment rescheduled. Went in for the last appointment of the day, the staffed was already checked out. They were there, but they just wanted to go home/get it over with.

Test was performed quickly, got a CD with images right away.</Review></record>

Mine was a seamless experience at SimonMed.  I was referred there by my chiropractor.  The intake process was standard.  The MRI also went smoothly and without incident.  I payed out of pocket, so I didn't have to hassle with insurance stuff.  Everyone seemed pleasant and professional.</text>

<userid>115685585849026103404< /userid><review>The place was clean, and the people were friendly and courteous.  The reason I deducted two stars is their policy for insurance submission.  I had to pay in full before any service, but I can't get a detailed receipt for my insurance company for up to six weeks.  And if that's not bad enough, I couldn't even request the receipt while I was there.  I have to call back to the very same people I was talking to another day to request it.

My mom has an appointment at this location. The staff was very friendly. Nice facility and good location. The check in area could be a bit more private as other patients don’t respect the “privacy boundaries “ while  others are checking in.</Text>

Danielle Huber and Jonathan Gorospe both did an excellent job of keeping me calm and focused during my appointment. Describing the process in great detail they were sure to care for my comfort at every step of the way. The machine is large and intimidating and can give people an uneasy feeling and my two doctors (techs), Danielle and Jonathan, made sure I was aware of what was happening and that I was ready to proceed. Couldn’t have asked for more! Thanks again!<//Review>

The staff here are friendly and prompt, and put me at ease while I had to go through two sets of MRIs in one day. From the receptionists to the tech who did my scan (Danielle, Liz, and Carrie), they made my visit as pleasant as it could be. I highly recommend this location if you have to have an MRI.</review>

Technician staff in exam is very friendly and patient, except staff who work in the authorization department not responsible and attitude is very rude. She delayed to sent the application of authorization and doesn’t follow up the status of application, let me need to change 2 times of appointment. Let me feel so uncomfortable.</Text>

Until now (last several years) I've had a good experience here. Not anymore. My doctor sent over an order for a chest x-ray. I walked over a couple of hours later and was told it would be at least a 2 hour wait and he 'really didn't know for sure how long' because their x-ray tech was out. No offer to see how a different location might be able to fit me in or anything. They don't allow any kind of appointments for x-rays so I was told to come back on Monday after 11am (a full 4 days later) and they'd be able to get me in. I took the time to walk over there just now (Monday ) and was told 'Oh, they're not doing them today.' No explanation for when they would be doing them or anything helpful. I had to ask how I could find out when they were doing them, was pointed to a card with a phone number to call and ask. So I've wasted my time twice going over there and there is zero insight into whether a third attempt would be a waste as well. Will not be using them for anything moving forward.<//Text>

Compared to where I'm from, this place is top notch in all aspects. Personable staff who kept in touch with me throughout the scan made it the best experience I've had since I was a child. At the end of it all, I didn't have to beg for a copy of my scans and the reading showed something wrong, not "there's nothing wrong with you" like I got in my home town. Thank you for everything, ladies and gentlemen :)<//review>

None of their information on their website is accurate. The times they offer services is definitely wrong, especially with x rays. I figured this might be the case so I called this location, got rerouted to a call center. An operator confirmed they take walk in for x rays until 5:30. Showed up at 5 and was told the cut off was 4:15. How can it be that a customer goes through extra effort to obtain correct information from both a businesses website and employees and yet that information is still completely wrong?! Total incompetence.<//text>

I have used this group (before renamed "SimonMed"  3 - 4 times, in each case with excellent experiences. That they open early, remain open evenings and offer (or did) weekend appointments is great. A few years back they were the only ones who would give you a CD of your study to leave with. Nothing bad to say at all.</Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1555631554082< /Time><Review>First time I went there for an X-ray, I was told that the technician is out for lunch so I came back later. Would have been good to know that. Went again and found out that my lab order says X-ray and also CT scan and it is actually a CT scan for which they need an appointment. So again I left without getting anything done and I had to take time off work for this. Showed up at the appointment, my third visit, and was told that the results take only 2 days. Went to pick up results after 3 days since the test, my 4th visit, and it wasn’t ready. Radiologist had not signed off on the analysis. If you’re picking up the image as well, it takes about 15 mins. They give you the image on a CD and they do not email the lab result. They either mail it to you which is slower or you pick it up. Not convenient.

Overall, a bad experience. On the plus side, I had to reschedule my appointment and that was easy to do over the phone and was able to get the desired appointment. Also, all the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I got a text with the incorrect amount that would be due at the appointment (received a call later with the correct amount, but I could’ve easily missed that call and assumed the text was correct). Had to wait 45 minutes before being seen and this was early in the morning. It was only after I said something that someone came to see me. The technician was not a clear communicator. I asked how long the mri would take and he said “I don’t know...a few minutes.” The first mri took 10-15 minutes. The next mri required my mouth to be open and there was no legitimate apparatus to keep my mouth open/bite down on. I had to bite on a fat syringe which is ridiculous. I’ll never go back to Simon Med if I can help it.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1567702399554, 'text': 'Hi Jessica , thank you for reaching out to us.

The experience at their location in downtown San Francisco was quite good.  Parking was easy. Staff was professional, friendly and helpful. Everything was clean and organized.  Chocolate in the lobby and complimentary parking are nice touches.

Scheduling thru the remote call center and getting insurance approvals clarified was very frustrating, error prone and time consuming.  They should improve that area<//review>

<review>Arrived ahead of time with all documents prepared. Was scheduled for 6:30 pm. Had to wait until 7:30 pm for MRI. Waiting area chilly & uncomfortable having only hard un-padded plastic chairs to sit on. MRI was for pinched nerve lower spinal damage. Hard plastic furniture not comfortable or suitable for people with painful back or physical injuries to have to use or wait on for services. Films delivered were satisfactory. Will seek better sites for future screenings.< /review><userid>111240144115200059400<//userid><resp>{'time': 1552594567611, 'text': 'Hello Georgia, thank you for contacting us regarding your experience.

Was supposed to get an mri at 8:30am, they call me at 8:25 to inform me the machine is down. I was already near the facility and had to miss work because of this. They were then unable to book me at any other location except for one 40 minutes away (after I called multiple times to try to be rescheduled) they told me the mri would be 30 minutes so I planned work meetings accordingly. I get to the back and they tell me it will be at least 45 minutes. I then come out and ask for a cd they tell me it will be 10 minuteS. I waited 25 minutes only for them to tell me they made the wrong cd. I Have now waited a total of 45 minutes just to get a cd of my results. I have been at the office for over 2 hours and have missed multiple work meetings. We'll see if any of these results actually get to my doctor... Absolutely the worst.<//Text>< Name>

I was told that I couldn’t make an appointment so I walked into the office only to find out that they weren’t doing xrays that day. I asked again about making an appointment and they told me I couldn’t set one and my best bet is to come in the next day at 8am. I showed up at 8am and the first question they asked was if I had an appointment. What?!?
There wasn’t much of a wait time so I’m happy about that. I was however truly concerned about the person that helped me in the lab. There was another patient and myself and on three different occasions (within one minute), she couldn’t remember our names and why we were there...she even told me she was “out of it today”. That’s not the person I want working on my medical records.
It was not a good experience.</text>

I was scheduled for an appt that required a “chaperone” and they did not have one for me so I was turned away and had to come back another time. No discount for the expensive test or other accommodation was offered to me for wasting my time. The only consolation was that the front desk guy was nice and as exasperated by the oversight as would be expected.</Text>

The shoulder MRI went well. This place advertise that they will pay for your parking across the street but some how after getting my parking validated I still had to pay for it... This explain why the receptionist handling this part of the transaction said " it  (validated ticket) SHOULD take care of it (payment)". I don't mind paying for my parking but I do not appreciate false advertising!!!< /review>

<review>My husband had a MRI for a torn Achilles at the 325 Sacramento location. The technician was an hour late and he hit my husband's foot against the machine. He didn't apologize for being late and overall had poor "bedside manners" (not sure what you would call the MRI equivalent). He seemed like the back up or fill in technician as he didnt seem to care about the quality of the services he provided.< /review>< pictures>

<userid>103389783555602478970</userid><Review>I arrived on time for my appointment. The two people working at the front desk obviously noticed i was standing in front of them at the desk trying to ck in, but they continued their conversation about some scheduling issues with other patients and after about 2 min of just standing there I acknowledged in any way,  I asked if I should sit down as they seemed busy. They said no I should wait - they continued the conversation, one walked away and the other, again without saying anything, spent another minute or two on the computer before acknowledging or ckg me in. They were running late for the appts, and they also disappointed other patients with the news that an employee  left for personal reasons and they couldn’t have their tests done that day (why didn’t they call those people and let them know not to come in??) and when I was finally called in, the person doing the test said nothing about what to expect, just said lie down - I would expect to be told things like “there will be recorded instructions telling you to hold your breath several times during the test, and other than that you will hear some loud noises and it will take about 5 minutes”. Pretty bad overall experience I’d say.< /Review></record>

<Review>The actual service was okay but the scheduling was not. They forgot one of my tests and said they would schedule a same day make up test. Guess what, they made a mistake and scheduled that two days out. Unbelievable. They asked me if I wanted to pay to expedite it back to today, at which point i was incredibly angry already.

I  asked-"how's the traffic on Thursday's?" They said fine but then I try to go, ugh! Don't ask! Then, I read that Thursday's are their busiest! Jeez! Felt like I was in NY. I live in the city but that was one crazy ride.< /Text>

They  wanted to charge me $25 to burn a CD of my MRI for me to keep. This is a process that takes minutes and the CD probably cost them $.25 cents.

They also guesstimate how much you should pay and how much your insurance will pay for your MRI.  It’s always wrong and they always end up having to send me a check in the end. This process of billing is crazy making and inefficient. It takes months to get reimbursed.<//text>

The were quick to make an appointment but the staff had not done my preauth before my appointment and mandated I had to pay or reschedule , even though they had all my information before and said it would be done before I arrived, I had to wait an hour and the ct tech didn’t have a proper way to hold my foot for the scan so he asked me to hold my broken foot really still .... this place is not professional by ANY means<//Review>

My appointment was delayed 2 hours. There were no robes left in the changing room. The place was dirty and dusty. No parking close to the clinic (SF location). After the MRI, the Tech forgot to remove the tape from my leg.</text>

Either MRI opening was too small (60cm) or the operator didn't know what they were doing. After being jammed in and unable to move, the oprerator was much too slow about extracting me. Also, no parking validation at Embarcadero Garage anymore. They should have mentioned the change of policy when they called me for pre-screening.<//text>

Reception is so rude and customer service couldn't be worth. Exam was also poor and they didn't read the hypothesis sent by the doctor. They didn't send the exam to the doctor, couldn't send him over fax or email when requested. I also asked for a second copy of my receipt and they said they wouldnt provide it. Do not recommend!!!</Text>

I went in for an injured ankle and waited at least 30 minutes which is fine. However,  when the xray tech (who was awesome!) Came to get me she was like umm the elevator is broken so I had to walk up a flight of stairs when I could barely put any weight on my ankle and was in loads of pain. The receptionist should have notified me that the elevator was broken when I arrived so I could've went elsewhere that didn't need me to cause more stress to an injury. If providing good customser service is too much to ask for at the very least they should've posted signs notifying patients that the elevator was broken . Again , my x ray tech was awesome but I feel the receptionist didn't thoroughly do her job and working in the medical field having bed side manner is crucial. Would never go here again.< /text>

<review>So not only have I given them my insurance information three times, they continue to say that my claim was denied. Also, they keep charging me for my payment plan even though I have kept calling saying that they need to go through my insurance first. I'm currently on hold because no live person will answer the phone. Avoid at all costs.< /review>< Name>

< Review>
The Simon Med Imaging in San Francisco Sacramento Street office staffs, are definitely 10 + Stars, very professional in handling my MRI schedule. Starting from the female scheduler (I believe her name is Anna but not 100% sure) who first scheduled my appointment, specially on weekend (Saturday), saving me time off from work to have my MRI done. Then, to the male individual (Simon, if I’m not mistaken) who confirm my appt and type of MRI, scheduled to be done and how long the process takes. The morning of my scheduled MRI, the young gentleman (Asian, I believe his name is Vince or Vincent) working at the front desk. Very professional,very helpful and very nice individual. It started when I came in few minutes late (due to parking issue) but this guy is all smile and with a welcome approach and I must say, the facility/office is well kept, very clean and a 10 star. Then, of all the people I met that morning for my MRI schedule, I completely forgot the person did my MRI on July 7, 2018, this guy I must commend, such a nice and very professional individual. He took my MRI with respect and shows tremendous caring. He started my MRI with careful approach and continued his non stop communication if I’m ok? If everything is ok? If I need additional pillow while he is performing my MRI? If Im cold and need a blanket? Man, this person or MRI Tech is a top notch, very professional. He was very careful from start to end and even ask me if I need to take few minute or 15 minutes before we continue to the next part of my MRI. I mean, he did this each after MRI. Very a Professional! Then, today July 7, 2018 when I pick-up my MRI result at approximately 4:00 PM. The female front desk representative was very quick (in and out).

Just the whole experience was great and over 110% of my expectation, compare to the other imaging center I was scheduled to go to in which I cancelled because the staffs are very unprofessional, rude and the office environment is not a place you want to go to. Very dirty and I immediately sense a bad and negative feeling about the place.

I must commend the Simon Med Inaging in San Francisco Sacramento Street office to anyone needed an MRI or imaging especially the Tech person on weekend (Saturday), nice and professional individual and I just wish he is my Treating Physician that will handle my pain injury. A top notch staffs and very professional work office location.</Review>

< review>
The reason why im leaving 2 stars is because it was a pain trying to get them to authorize the MRI. All they had to do is call the insurance it was already authorized and they cancelled me 3 times. I was scheduled for March 29 I called in the morning to see if everything was ready to go and they tell me yes. Im going from San Mateo and traffic is a pain i get there and they tell me the insurance wasnt ready. And the receptionist was very rude. The day my son was actually seen everything went smooth thank god because I was ready to start a scene.</review>

< Review>
Never go to this company!
After I had an MRI, gave them my insurance info and paid, they made an error of some sort and failed to keep track of the fact I'd paid them and they incorrectly took down my Blue Shield info and rather than contacting me or the insurance company to figure out what had happened they just sent debt collectors ('CMRE FSI') after me - asking for what the price would have been if I hadn't had insurance >$1,000. Once I figured out what had happened I contacted Health Diagnostics and my insurance - the woman I spoke with at Health Diagnostics assured me they would call the debt collectors off and would write me a letter so I could contest this hit to my otherwise great credit score. Weeks - nay - months later I'm still getting contacted by the same debt collection agency, and I never got a letter explaining what had happened so I can contest this on my credit report. Don't go here unless you'd like this horrible situation, and continual harassment from debt collectors to be your reality. Health Diagnostics you are the worst and I'm not done with you.< /Review>

This was truly a terrible experience with awful customer service. Vague details on pricing that included surprise deductable costs that apparently couldn't be shared until I walked in the door.

I walked out before I even got an MRI because they were so rude. Avoid at all costs.</review>

This is the second day in a row I am calling them to schedule an appointment. I am on hold for 17minutes now still waiting for the next available scheduler to pick up. Same experience multiple times yesterday and today. This is unacceptable.< /Review>

Cole has everything, minus the super-in-demand items that no one has like canning supplies circa late September 2020. Seems like a small store until you realize the shelves slide to reveal a second layer (!) and there's a cavernous downstairs area packed with hardware goodies.</review>

There is NOTHING like living within walking  distance of a Cole Hardware store. Great people with the things you need so you don't have to go to a big box.<//Text>

Very helpful staff. It is easy to find help when you need it, and the store almost always has what I need. Curbside parking only.</review>

<review>My favorite store in the neighborhood! Cole Hardware has really great quality products. All the staff are helpful and knowledgeable about their products. One in particular, Jon, has been a great resource in one of my home improvement projects. Also love that they have a monthly happy hour and seasonal workshops.< /review>< userid>

<username>Lame Janu<//username><text>It was a beautiful day and we’re new in the area and went to explore around.  we went to this store with mask, hat on and 😱... we were there only for new minute and almost 5 employees came and ask if we need anything which is nice but their  looks towards us were so uncomfortable. Usually I like to explore and relax while shopping so I try to take time and concentrate what I need and what to get but I was so disturb. I couldn’t set my mind. I really liked few items  here and wanted to buy but my mood was totally ruined and left without nothing. I rather drive an hour to different store then going back here, where I am comfortable and  enjoy shopping. please don’t judge people with their looks we had mask on to stay safe and hat was on because it was sunny. We didn’t came to steal. I am never coming back but a little tip for you Make customer feel comfortable and let them explore  and I am sure if anyone needs help they will walk to you< /text><response>{'time': 1589150566737, 'text': "Hello, and welcome to the neighborhood, and thank you for posting a review. I'm so sorry your first time shopping with us was a disappointment for you. A couple of points of clarification: Our staff always tries to be helpful and greet all customers rather than walking by them. It's our brand of customer service and please don't take offense to it. Secondly, on very busy days like Saturday, we can't allow browsing in the store for too long when there are other customers waiting to get in so they can do their shopping. It's a requirement of essential stores to manage customer flow. I hope you understand and might give us another try, either on a weekday or again after Shelter in Place is over. I urge you to ask your new neighbors about our store. I think you will find most feel very positive about our store and staff and are as thankful for the store being in the neighborhood as we are grateful to be there. Regardless, I wish you all the best. Stay safe and healthy."}<//response><Time>1589056936209< /Time><rate>1<//rate></record></dataset><record>

I ordered online with Ace Hardware, who delivers to this store. Due to the circumstances of the moment, I was unable to get to the store within the time frame for pickup (5 days). Ten minutes after I got the cancellation email, I called the store. I naively thought, maybe they'd just tell me that it was still there, and if I got there by EOD, it would still be there. Or hold on to it. However, the manager was completely unhelpful in telling me whether it was in stock, and just said that it was the policy. The first person I spoke to sounded like he was 15 and we couldn't even communicate, apparently, because suddenly I was talking to the store manager... ? With coronavirus, you would think that maybe they have the time to relax that cancel policy. Needless to say, I will be re-shopping for my extremely popular and instantly sold-out garden trellis elsewhere! What irks me the most is that shipping time was delayed by a week, which I waited for without taking issue, but as for my own delay in picking up said item, there is no slack.<//review>

My favorite neighborhood hardware store. The wooden floors squeak & they do have bargains! Before you order from Amazon, go to Cole. That item might very well be less & you can take it home with you today. If you haven't been to Cole, treat yourself & go over there soon.<//text>

Too expensive and they have a lot of high priced things that no one really needs.  The two main positives about this store are (1) they are open later than most other hardware stores and (2) I understand they are very good to their workers.< /text>

<user_name>Andrew Copert<//user_name><Text>I used to live just across the Panhandle from Cole Hardware's original location on Cole in SF and they were my go-to when I had a project around the apartment so was happy to see them expand across the Bay to Rockridge (I think they were stalking me).

Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Pretty good selection of goods. They will special order stuff that they don't have in stock.

If you need a specialty tool for just one use ask about their tool lending service. I found out about this when I was guessing at the size of the shower valve wrench I'd need and the guy helping me asked me if this was for a project or something I'd need long term for multiple uses.

Parking can be difficult, but they are near BART, if you can easily carry what you're going to buy.</Text>< Pics>

Certainly a store with everything and great service too but you pay the price... it’s unbelievably expensive. Unless something is on sale I’d stay away from this place ... yes may even go to the hated Home Depot. Examples:  Myers soap products almost twice as expensive some other stores -even other ace hardware stores; Birdseed forget about it, you’ll go broke the prices are a joke. Again, nice people, well stocked, be prepared to pay through the nose (Guess they got to pay for what must be outrageous rent somehow).<//review>

terrible customer service. called ahead to make sure they have the white noise machines I'd like in stock before driving 20 minutes to get them. but turned out the lady on the phone located the wrong ones and didn't make any attempt to look for them in the store. and the cashier wasn't trying to be helpful at all. will not return to this store.< /text>

<Text>Yes, they have Benjamin Moore paint, and they mix it expertly — but the real reason to shop here is the truly incredible staff. Every single person is smart, friendly, and above-and-beyond helpful (Emiel and Kira are especially great, and made a recent home-improvement project a pleasure to complete).

The prices are also surprisingly reasonable, especially for a store not backed by the usual corporate megaliths. Absolutely worth a special trip.<//Text>< response>

They have way more in here than you would imagine, and the people here are remarkably friendly and helpful. The prices arent always the same as you find on the Ace website, but they are willing to honor the sale prices. Parking is not easy in this busy neighborhood, but if you can get in, you will be able to find most of what you need.<//review>

Great store. Sad that the one near my house in Noe Valley was the victom of a terrible fire, but I'm glad this one is near my business! Always excellent service, and it's SO much easier to find anything here than it is than going to a massive Home Depot, and the staff is a million times more helpful. They have pretty much anything the bigger guys have so keep it local!</text>

This hardware store has a little bit of everything. Some really niche items and usually you'll find what you need here. Sometimes it's hard to find some basic stuff though. What they lack in catalog though they make up for in help, they have a wonderful staff who always seem eager to help.< /Review>

<Review>I pulled up to this place since we were looking for some seafood. Loved the look and vibe of the outside and inside. We talked about having a party there just based on the looks.  The service was quick and friendly. These are the 2 stars I gave them.
We ended up ordering the same thing, as we were both craving seafood. The “Big Baja Bucket”. It comes with lobster,shrimp, chicken, skirt steak, corn on the cob, beans, rice, and flour tortillas.
Unfortunately when the food arrived we were very disappointed. It had smaller than I would expect seafood portions. That’s not a deal breaker, as long as it’s done well. It was not. The shrimp and lobster were overcooked, rubber. The chicken was so salty, it was inedible. The skirt steak was ok, and the corn was dry and tasteless. She had Mexican style corn and I had the grilled. Both tasteless. I looked over and noticed my date was only eating the corn, the “best item in the bowl. Even the rice and beans were boring. Liked the tortillas and sauces.
Normally I would try to go back a second time to see if they were just have an very off night. That will not be the case this time.
Really wanted to like this place.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNaXrOo63uKZE7tdUpPwcGw9NqdS6VEiMgL9l8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2oiegyXuiUI_uza7bjqMCYCmbJW3yhbOjPi2e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqyqJ44jmQomR29cH7Y9Gn72jBSuFmUKnnqDNs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOohRR2oiy_AFVVHu1Esz2qsLVBAw5HzA_MVyKv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNgALOgLWZs1rsnoIQM1xLVI54PgzkvqGrloVe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>Great spot for seafood. I’m usually not one to eat fish tacos but figured I’d give them a try here and I’m so glad I did because it was delicious! Been here a couple of times, it’s a bit pricey but then again it’s seafood and in a tourist location. The service was great no complaints about that at all. We were able to find something to eat for everyone, I have a family of four with a very picky 7 yr old. The only downfall is I wish my drink was a bit stronger, I got a fish bowl and didn’t even get a buzz. Overall great experience and would definitely recommend.< /review>< pics>

Omg.... we are so full and happy. We decided to get the Baja bucket for 2 with a side cluster of snow crab and a Pineapple Margherita. Such a great idea. There were 6 small lobster tails, so many shrimp we didn't know if we could eat it all (oh, but we did).  The corn and the sides were so good too.  We ate almost everything,  leaving behind a small bit of the skirt steak and chicken. Not because it wasn't cooked perfectly,  just because we ate way too many chips and Salas before the meal arrived. They ar slightly seasoned and so addictive. I'd say go here soon. It's not a cheap date, but so worth every penny spent. Yum.<//Review>

Just off the main strip of old town San Diego. Decent prices, food is super good though and the lobster tacos are real spiny lobster and not longastino. The decor is relaxed Baja inspired and the running fountain in the main dining area is relaxing. Oh and the lobster bites were amazing, and even though it was an appetizer, it could totally be a meal by itself with the fries it comes with.< /review>

< review>
I had made reservations a couple days prior to going online. As we walk up we see that the entrance is is roped off to two sections on top it says “enter” and “exit” there are people standing around waiting on both sides. So we stand on the side that says enter, did not know that was the stand by side. The other side is for people to wait who have reservations. (We didn’t find this out till after we were waiting in line and just watching other people go in). It was difficult to get someone to even answer the question, “Where do we stand if we have a reservation?” There was a woman of color waiting on the reservation side thinking she was suppose to wait there to be seated as a walk up. She had been waiting longer than us, they told her she had to be in the other line by then the walk up line had grown and she had to go all the way to the back. We told her not to wait in the back and she could go ahead of us. She was really thankful. Point being, all the confusion could be avoided if there was a clear sign that says walk up and reservations.
The food was good, portions are a good size as well. I got a margarita and it was more ice than anything. The service inside was good. I get it you get the Baja experience without having to cross the border, I just personally think there are better sea food places in San Diego.<//review>

Rockin' Margaritas, lightly salted fresh chips and salsa and service! Yes, indeed full menu service.

Outside ambience with heated lamps and overtones of waterfall melodies was quite a delightful atmosphere given the confusion of lawmakers and restaurants. Reservations are highly recommended although walk-ins are accepted. You will likely be waiting if arriving 3 pm or later on a Saturday.

We ordered only a salad and fries and lots of libations. Many guests eat and leave within 45 minutes because the service is quick to turnover. We stayed a couple of hours because girl time is necessary during these times. Although not on the menu, order a 🥥+ 🍍 margarita on the rocks with Don Julio.

Contactless menus and payments. Cash accepted. Masks are required,🌡️ is taken and all staff practice safety measures. The service was impeccable!</text>

That figure is accurate as of today as this is the 16th anniversary of my wife and I's 2nd date, which was here. The food, the environment, the staff, is all excellent. This particular location is in the heart of Old Town, so if perusing the shops is on the menu, then add this stop for lunch or dinner, and you won't be disappointed.  I had the Baja Surf and Turf Bucket, which includes steak, shrimp, and chicken, and my wife ordered the Fajitas De Baja. We shared an appetizer of Esquite Con Chile on the cob(this comes either in a bowl on on the cob). I rinsed everything down with a Chamango Rita. I cannot stress enough how great the everything is for the pricepoint. You would do well to order extra sweet butter, and mango salsa, because they disappear fast.</text><date>1618780341747<//date><UserId.>115671284837474992284< /UserId.>< resp>

Place is jammin. Pretty good wait, even with a reservation. We were a party of 7 on a Saturday evening, so wait was understandable.  Large menu selection.  Good food.<//Review>

Fantastic place to eat seafood. The food tasted great & our waitress was wonderful. I recommend the buckets, sea of cortez & lobster tails were well worth the price. I will definitely come back again.< /text>

Stumbled across this place the other night, I had a killer margarita and a couple carnitas tacos that were actually really good. Their specialty is buckets of lobsters, steak and chicken with all the sides. Best part was Blanca my server, super friendly and knowledgeable, great service and recommendations! Thanks Blanca!</Review>

Our experience started out great. Seated quickly. 6ft distance between tables. Though most customers were wearing mask when they weren't eating. Staff had masks on the entire time. The second time our waiter came, he took our drink order then food order. Our orders came out in a timely manner. He checked on us once then didn't see him anymore until wed been waiting for our check for about 15 mins. His co-worker saw us looking for him and I'm guessing found him cause he appeared asking if we wanted more drinks. At that point we just wanted our check. I must include no one in our party was upset or annoyed. He would of had a bigger check if he'd checked on us more. My entree was the shrimp and lobster bites. The seafood was over cooked and the fries were soggy. Disappointing. My Kiwi Colada was Amazing!!</Review>

< Review>
We had been at Sea World for the day and one of our party wanted lobster so we headed to this restaurant. Our seating outside was nice and the waiter was attentive. I seldom drink, but a maragarita sounded so good so I ordered one on ice with salt. I drank enough to see that the class was totally full of ice. At that point you could not tip the class or the ice would fall on your face. I didn't complain, but my daughter as to see someone about the drink. A man came, which later was told it was the manager, and he said that he had been making this drink for 40 years and that this is how he always does it. He said that is the only way you don't taste the alcohol.? He asked me if I wanted a straw to reach the remaining drink. At that point my daughter told him to take it back and don't charge us. He then commented I should not have drank it if I had a problem. Shaming me into looking like I just wanted a free drink. I know we were sun burned and had park clothes so I felt he was degrading to me and to my daughter (I am in my 70's). I asked my friend on FB and they agreed this was not right. He could have taken out some ice and put in some more mix and taken care of the problem. We had all ordered food and we did tip our waiter well. His treatment of me was degrading.</Review>

Fun and funky atmosphere with large, semi-covered outdoor area. The vibe almost carries this restaurant into being passable, but the food just isn't good.<//Review>

<user_name>William Simpson<//user_name><text>Stumbled across this place the other night, I had a killer margarita and a couple carnitas tacos that were actually really good. Their specialty is buckets of lobsters, steak and chicken with all the sides. Best part was Blanca my server, super friendly and knowledgeable, great service and recommendations!

The restaurant was pretty packed during the time I went. I went with my family and liked the asthetic of the restaurant. The service was a bit slow and the food was a bit overpriced. If you are looking for great seafood that suits the price you should try looking somewhere else.<//Review>

< review>
Amidst the global pandemic this place has pumped up their overall cost of your bill by 4% to account for a list of reasons why the company cannot pay its employees the wage or the benefits they deserve. This information is provided on a small laminated placard at the hostess stand. As a result, YOU, the patron, will pay the difference to make up for the business’s shortcomings. If everyone’s paycheck reflected the 4% inflated cost of living this might make sense. Problematically, what this really says is “We know we haven’t been paying our employees a livable wage. We still can’t. Here, you do it instead.” It’s arguable that supplies (gloves, hand sanitizer, barriers, etc.) have been implemented as mandatory to keep business operating. However, that is what overhead is for. As a capitalist, your lackluster budgeting is putting you in the position to take from where you should be giving. You’ve earned this one.

Congratulations, your capitalism will be your demise and you will only have yourself to blame. :)< /review>

<user>113005512761413384800</user><name>Paul Kendrick<//name><text>This was not my first visit to this restaurant.  My last visit was over 10yrs ago.  A lot has changed since then.  The scenery and ambiance is similar to what I remember.  However, the food is not.  We started off with the Calamari.  It was cooked nicely, not over battered.  The sauce they poured over it was a sweet chili style, which was unusual, but good.  Next we all ordered tacos.  I had the Tres Amigos with everything.  The mixture of steak and shrimp was well done.  I didn't care for the nacho cheese they poured over it.  It really overpowered the taste of meat.  I wished I would have asked for hard shell, instead of the soft tortillas.  The rice and beans were just okay to me.  Nothing to write home about.  The others in my group had the fish tacos, the ahi tacos, and carne asada tacos.  The Ahi was amazing.  The fish taco was okay.  The carne asada was okay.  Lastly, we had the fried ice cream.  That was a pleasant surprise.  It was just enough for the 3 of us to enjoy it. Over all the meal was okay.  Next time I will order what they are known for, Lobster.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

<Review>I came here on a Sunday late morning. I had a lobster taco, shrimp taco, mussels and shrimp cocktail and two maragaritas. I highly recommend everything I ate. The place is fun and I loved all the TVs being in different channels. My waitress was amazing. Very helpful and recommended the lobster taco. It was so good.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Salty food, red pork enchiladas were horrible, Margaritas served in a cheap plastic cup, tasted like they use cheap wine to make them instead of Tequila. I thought I was in Tijuana. Half of the chips were super salty dusted with a red powder on them. The regular iced tea tastes like a combination of their raspberry iced tea and regular iced tea. I returned the Margarita and my pork enchiladas. I settled for a selected few chips and salsa brought to our table and a bowl of the Lobster Corn Chowder which wasnt bad.
At the end, I asked the server why we were being charged a surcharge she calls Manager over. A tall raspy-speaking guy came to our table and proceeded to explain the reason for the surcharge. Basically what I got is he prefers to charge this surcharge instead of raising the prices due to the  minimum wage now being $15 an hour. When I advised him it wouldve been nice to be told up front he gave me a very matter of fact look and replied "ITS ON THE MENU.." Forgive me for not looking for a surcharge in a not-so-well-lit restaurant when I'm trying to figure out what sounds appealing for me for dinner, I thought to myself then I replied "ok". But the whole time thinking IM NEVER COMING BACK HERE".

The whole time I sat there, I was highly aware of the close proximity to vehicles buzzing and speeding by about 20 to 25 feet away just over a horizontal wooden fence. I could see the headlights in between the wood planks and at times the noise was deafening especially if a HOG went by.

The prices were not necessarily expensive. however,  I dont mind paying more for good food and good spirits.

The wait in line for 3 people was not bad. The speed and accuracy of the servers was good.

I love road trips. Over the last couple years I've noticed a decline in excellent customer service.<//Review>

My family of 5 went on a Saturday night at 7pm. Seafood was good and so were the drinks. We had the Virgin frozen strawberry smoothie with lobster/shrimp combo. It helped tremendously that we reserved a table ahead of time because there was a long line when we arrived. But we were quickly seated because we had made a reservation. Our waiter too was very pleasant. There was free parking located in the front of the restaurant’s building which was very convenient. The food prices were a bit steep for the portion of food. Our experience was overall good & it’s a place I will consider visiting again.< /Text>

The Baja Bucket is a good deal, good enough for 2 people, with average appetites. The lobster and shrimp were pretty good, the carne asada was ok. There was also dark meat chicken. Comes with rice and beans on the side, and some honey butter that you can spread over the tortillas. I liked it on the grilled corn on the cob. Reasonably priced, and pretty good sized private parking lot, if you're not there on a weekend.<//Review>

This is my third time at this location. The first two times the service was great, the food on the other hand was so so, anything fried was hot and nice, but the side dishes was always Luke warm especially the rice and the meats for taco... you guys need a better steam table system that keeps the quality up and food that is cooked in bulk hot. I order Skillet seafood the third time Togo...[ walked in and ordered]and by the time i got it and to my car it was lLuke warm...</text>

This place was not what we expected. Although we had a reservation they didn't let the guests that arrived a little early from our party to come in and wait. The service was very slow and I understand they were busy. I don't think we had a waitress, it was the bartender going back and forth taking our drink orders and food order, she was so lost. It seemed like she didn't know what she was doing and took so long to come and offer if we needed anything else. For sure we will not return.< /Text>

Could easily become one of my favorite places in SD!  She may have been a new.

Certainly a place to try with friends.  The Fish Tacos were plump & tasty, located in a convenient spot in quaint Old Town with parking and fun ambience!!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Me and my fiance got the worst food poisoning last week. I had to take her to the ER because she was so sick.  $100 for a bucket with funky tasting lobster. I knew I shouldn't have keep eating it. It was cold too. For the price no warm butter....? Entire meal was cold. This is my first ever review on Google. Sorry to the owners but should probably figure it out. Its not that hard to serve a fresh, warm meal. Especially at the price.</Text>

Good service, followed rules to keep place safe for covid with checking temperature and having you use hand sanitizer before entering.  Gosh I can't remember our server's name, brown hair, looks like a healthy gym guy. But anyway excellent service make sure we had all that we needed to have a nice dinner for 5 people.  Always around checking out the table he's serving and available to help.  Nice cute atmosphere and I'm glad we brought our friend who's visiting from Florida to have a nice last California meal before she go back home.  It's next door to old town in case you need to walk out your food.  Will be back with more friends.</Text>

If your in the mood for seafood, this is the place to go. A bit on the pricey side, but worth it. Each seafood platter big enough to feed 2-3 people, easily. They also have many other options to pick from if seafood is not for you. Great upbeat atmosphere, live music and dancing, all set in the heart of Old Town in San Diego. Great prices on drinks during happy hour, and friendly staff.</text>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>Went there a week ago and ordered the big lobster bucket.  The food was tasty but the amount of food for the money is not worth it.  Our waitress was nice but unfortunately because the business wants to be petty and charge a 4% surcharge, the waitress lost money in her tip.  If a business has to charge a surcharge, then they are not running the business properly.</review>< Pictures>

We stood in line 1hr and half they sat us outside fine they told.us heat lamp would be turned on.  It never was.  All the other tables out front outside had heat lamps.it was 65 degrees last night.  They stated they couldn't move us due to resverations.  Joke there were tables.inside and outside with heat lamps.  We felt just because we were a group of 5 people  of color and we felt like they would not try to work something out for us.  If you go there make a reservation first.  That way you wont share the same experience we did.  Thank God I  wore my thick coat.  It was still so cold with it and food got cold so fast not a good experience.</Review>

< Review>
So on my quest to find fish n chips as good as "Fisherman's market and grill in Palm Desert,CA My next stop finds me at "Rockin Baja Lobster in Old Town. 3 out of 5 stars just ok. Got the bucket fish n chips, street corn, and horchata. Cod pieces not as big as they describe(they use the word huge) they were not. And when are places that serve fish n chips going to figure out that the only kind of fries you should serve with fish n chips are thick cut fries, or big fat potato wedges(Like fishermans market and grill). Better than "Mr. fish n chips" on balboa ave, and "Kings Fish house in Mission Valley(see my reviews for both places).went there on 4-17-2021.They check your temp at door which I liked, waitress/bartender who took my money not wearing her mask over her nose,and mouth(just mouth) I did not like. Old town parking was a pain. I think i'm done here with my fish n chips quest in SD, I'll just wait  until I go back to "Fishermans market and grill in palm desert.<//Review>

<text>Good during a nice day but dont go if its chilly. Outside dining on side near parking lot gets cold and the heaters dont keep you warm enough. Lobster was over cooked and shell was soft so it was hard to eat since the shell cracker just smashed the lobster instead of crack it. Good service though and drinks were great. "Golden Sombrero" is a bit pricey and would've been great, just sad lobster was soft.<//text>< user>

I had the lobster tacos and they were really good. I did enjoy them. The service is great. Our waiter Chris was excellent. I'm from Los Angeles and I will definitely be back the next time I'm in the SD area.</text>

<text>Made reservations for 12 for a birthday dinner 1 thing l didn't like was they reserved seats for us outdoors in front alone, then gave me the options of going inside outdoors alone again away from everyone was a terrible idea again l didn't like that idea at all either because l didn't understand why we couldn't sit inside with everyone eles and inside was way nicer then outside. I also didn't like the fact that my guest had to ask management why we had to sit outside and ask for a seat inside when clearly it was a big enough table to sit all of us in. This is my 1st time at this place and it's going to be my last time coming to this place. I made reservations for a birthday dinner l clearly didn't feel the birthday treatment as soon as l walked in being seated outside alone looking at the parking lot. However l still had a great bithday coz all my family/close friends showed up.< /text><Time>1613565917652</Time></record></dataset><record>

Surf and turf tacos were really delicious, wife loved her  seafood enchiladas also. I would go back.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Time>1618699396336<//Time><Rate>3<//Rate><Review>So on my quest to find fish n chips as good as "Fisherman's market and grill in Palm Desert,CA My next stop finds me at "Rockin Baja Lobster in Old Town. 3 out of 5 stars just ok. Got the bucket fish n chips, street corn, and horchata. Cod pieces not as big as they describe(they use the word huge) they were not. And when are places that serve fish n chips going to figure out that the only kind of fries you should serve with fish n chips are thick cut fries, or big fat potato wedges(Like fishermans market and grill). Better than "Mr. fish n chips" on balboa ave, and "Kings Fish house in Mission Valley(see my reviews for both places).went there on 4-17-2021.They check your temp at door which I liked, waitress/bartender who took my money not wearing her mask over her nose,and mouth(just mouth) I did not like. Old town parking was a pain. I think i'm done here with my fish n chips quest in SD, I'll just wait  until I go back to "Fishermans market and grill in palm desert.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

It was raining therefore the seating service was slow. But Juan was our server and he was EXCELLENT food came out hot and tasty. Tacos to die for...lobster perfect. Guacamole ohhhh my so awesome. Needless to say I had a wonderful food experience. A must try when in San Diego especially if you don't eat meat like my husband and I.  Great seafood choices. One down side the rice and beans, oh no I would pass...< /text>

said it was a full bucket when it got to the table it looked like a lot till we started digging in and realized there was a basket under the food to make it look like a lot more than what was< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP41yH-GwMk7XUmQgwsR5KL4EALbZDcDgmoJQu7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2vv8Fs2JEh2na9QCbdhWng10q2lpr6sJhCNYN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

Excellent food and service but manager is a complete tool.  He feeds me typical corporate rhetoric which is absolute nonsense. He’s trying to sell me on a “surcharge.” Trying to nickel and dime your customers due to not being able to figure out how to have a proper business model is not acceptable. It’s not my problem to fund whatever short falls there may be.< /review>

(I wish I could give Negative Stars !!)
Entire waitstaff has their head's up their @$$
Consumer Warning; Despite receiving a huge PPP loan, Rockin' Baja Lobster has instituted a $5.20 per Table Surcharge. I made Reservations (2-days in advance) for Wife's B-Day Party.
Our entire group had arrived & checked-in with the Maître d' ahead of the reservation, but they didn't have any tables ready, not even +10-min's past our reservation time !? Although Google said 'Dine-In was Allowed' (post Covid-19 Reopening) Sadly we discovered that Dine-In was for 'Patio Seating' Only!
(Despite most other restaurants in Old Town having full Dine-In seating available!!)
...And then we noticed that there was actually vacant Patio seating available before, during, & past our Reservation time. -So why weren't we being seated !?
Our patio seating was NOT covered by an overhead awning, and there was burnt ash particles (from an earlier San Diego fire) that was snowing down all over our open-air table.
Additionally, there were swarms of black fly's buzzing around our table, because the tables were not properly cleaned from the previous guests,
We were forced to sit at this Ash-Covered, Fly-Infested Nightmare for another 10-Min's, while the waitstaff totally ignored us,
My Son had to get up and interrupt a group of idle-handed waitress' to ask them to bring us some silverware & menu's.
The silverware arrived -but the menus did not !
We weren't informed by waitstaff that we'd need to download a QR code reader App to scan their 3-D dot code menu's to our phones.
Ice Water NEVER arrived at our table!! Chips & Salsa NEVER arrived at our table!! We watched anxiously while the FOUR idle waitress' chatted away totally ignoring us. Our entire group got up and left in total disgust.!!<//Review>< pics>

Experience felt rushed, menu had incorrect items, and check was brought to us very quickly - without asking if we were ready to close. Seafood was good, skip the rice, tastes very acidic, steak was subpar and their cheese tasted sour. Normally, I have a good experience here, but this time wasn’t very pleasant. Waitress was nice but attempted to pick a fight regarding the menu that clearly stated a drink I asked for couldn’t be served the way it was advertised on the menu. Would go again, but only if in the area or with someone else paying. Not worth the money.</text>

Bathrooms were disgusting! They sat us outside with no heaters, and the food was undercooked and cold. Never again!</Review>

Even though the food was little expensive, it tasted exceptional!  They had a free tortillas chip bar and the Margarita special was phenomenal!  Service was pretty good.  They have parking so don't bother anywhere else.  Thanks.<//text>

<Text>Popped in to Rockin’ Baja by chance trying to find a shop just outside the Old Town Park area. We had put our names in at the popular restaurants with an hour and twenty min wait, so we took a chance walked up to Rockin’ Baja and were seated right away.  The restaurant is very large and can easily accommodate groups.  We enjoyed the live music, pitcher of Cadillac margaritas, salsa bar and our food. Everyone was pleased with what they ordered.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Food was great.  Lobster was a bit small for the price but meal very tasty.   The only complaint I had was so many files.  Even though the seating is outside they could utilize a fly catcher.  Get them at home  depot.<//Text>< pics>

Overall it was a nice place if you are in the neighborhood. Outdoor seating at the back was pleasant. We really liked the lobster chowder soup.</Text>

<Text>We are (no, we were) old Rockin' Baja Lobster customers. We ordered the lobster deal for two. Worst crab fish, yes, too small to call them lobster tails. Also, they were too salty to be edible and slight on the burned side. The beefsteak tasted funny, almost like a soybean steak. They included now the smallest flour tortillas they have ever provided. The chip had a hint of being fried in (recycled?) fish oil, we say that because the chips had a strong taste of fish.

Reluctantly, we are giving them one star because the shrimp were large but, unfortunately, also very salty. And, because the chard chicken was the only good thing on our plate.

This is our last visit to Rockin' Lobster in Old Town. We longer can recommend them.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<name>Gamine Kishin<//name><time>1544588750741</time><rating>4</rating><Review>Visited the location in Old Town.  There have been others, but only this one has been constant.  Happy hour only applies in the limited space bar area.  Prices can be high, but happy hour, taco tuesday, & other specials are not bad.  Goes well with the Old Town atmosphere & San Diego vibe.  Great if you want Mex/Cali-Mex seafood, but for beef, pork, & chicken Mex & Cali-Mex, there are better restaurants within 2-3 blocks. Tequila Lime shrimp is a mouth-gasm for all shellfish eaters.  Service varies from mediocre to amazing on an American scale (which is more attentive than most other countries...).  The unlimited chips & salsas self-serve is also a fun way to taste, share, & "start the party".  Generally great food, fun atmosphere, good drink selection (with & without alcohol), & set up for a mix of tourists & locals. Worth a trip - taking a visiting friend there next week.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnr-oth-ICV_yuYs3qevfobf8VBriZO5FQ9wrd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeMpYTdMiRPuCzfhvdEx_AC8lWxk3wS3y7hzT4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxqmp8XnPo2gf1PHa1TVRnJZ60cKqKLPww_Smy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRQbBbW4f5eQ8kr9W6VBm1VP8O14F19mVVURnp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3raX2EGUC-wAVnoQVos0_N7nD95L_OvCaSgCV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKyc6D1qElzXloSvzNNE_vgrcd7zR9pscMRg2U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKOcoEEhbfsMj4qX89ehf9U8gXTDk1iXOYOUn-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFb5L7Qx-JFXiVeVS9QJn2lJFROvlS7h2cYCYS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPt6fGTaRH4Kn91hH699rbKI9HjrKPYd68I4pni=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOvYTQHVOeYj2whIBl53sGRLejfRs1rMYRS9b5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUStdxkKHhQsdknibpQ4QMKbECNDuc6y_WFDat=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_NRrsoT4zKaDlprUM2DZZ1ZkLWp5t-vGKRdU1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Overall a very nice place to eat, most of the food is good, but some of the meats can be dry. This place is often busy and hard to find a place to park. So it can be better to park far and walk, this is a place that will surely leave lasting memories on your trips.<//Text>

Guacamole ohhhh my so awesome. Needless to say I had a wonderful food experience. A must try when in San Diego especially if you don't eat meat like my husband and I.  Great seafood choices.

My family had soda and tea refills and we got charged for every glass they drank. I paid and when I got home I realized the highway robbery. It never used to be that way. They should notify customer instead of just charging per glass. If this is what it has come down too, there are better restaurants that are honest with there customers.. i will no longer hold company dinners at this restaurant. They lost my business.<//text>< pictures>

First time visiting, at first I was about to get up and walk out, due to being there 15-20 minutes and not once did our waiter come bay to greet us and at least take a drink order. Then a waitress by the name of Linda S. swung by and saved the day! (Although she was not our original server, she saw us sitting there for an extended period  of time) She took our order, and within seconds after ordering our appetizer arrived at out table, and 10 minutes later our entrees came. Linda was on top of her game and took great care of us. The atmosphere was awesome! as was the food. Linda made our dining experience a great one, I will definitely be returning the next time I'm in the area. The only reason that I'm not going with 5 stars is due to the extended wait after we were seated.<//text>

A fantastic Mexican restaurant, whose signature is seafood, especially lobster. There are variety of Mexican beers and Margaritas. These Mexican drinks are really matched with Mexican salsas. I just came back from Mexicali at that moment, but nothing was different from that of real Mexican and enjoyed a lot even after big lunch there.</text>

Nice festive place in old town, plenty of space and very friendly staff. Good drinks and food during happy hour. Plenty of space to kick your heels up and stay for a while, or wrap up and get something quick. Highly recommended if you are in Old Town.< /review>

The quality of food of a restaurant called Lobster is really unfortunate. I ordered lobster lover combo and my husband ordered Baja style lobster. They both turned out quite terrible. The lobsters tasted old and frozen. I know that's not Baja style. It is market price on the menu. I think they can do better than that. Service is very slow. Nice but slow. I asked for a cup and more salsa and none came. I think the server came around once so the table didn't get any refill or even an offer to refill our sodas. So...not going back...even with the free parking.<//text>

<review>Service took a hit like most restaurants including getting an extra salsa cup that when opened, contained nothing because it was a used one from another table.
Food is still good and plentiful.
Still can't sit at the bar as of 30OCT.<//review>< Pictures>

This place was perfect for family gatherings, great drink selection and the food was amazing! Nice spacious location and nice staff too. It would be nice if they played music outside rather than just inside though. Thank you.< /Review>

Best seafood eating. Original pot is loaded with shrimp, lobster, chicken, carńe, and corn. For 2 people but can feed 4 skinny broods. Definitely a must have to eat at place for lunch or dinner.< /Text>

Wife and I often come to this restaurant for our Get Away Weekend's. We always have an excellent experience here! On this occasion, during the Level Red CoVid opening we wondered if our experience was going to be worth the expense, this restaurant was Spot On! With the assistance of our Server, Raul, all our needs were met and our dining experience was perfect! Thanks Raul and Thank you Rockin' Baja! Great as always.<//review>

<name>Shari< /name><Text>Great as usual. Only suggestion is, I think the staff should ask if they would like chips and salsa. Since it is not out, for obvious resaons. I asked my server if they have it and he said their manager says it will only be on request. I dont understand that because some people are far too timid to speak up sometimes plus it was a free self serve item. Seems an little odd.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80deaade206267a3:0x3e05f6215d552d43</gmap_id><Date>1600568556507<//Date><user>101391524965634398339< /user><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>4< /Rating>< Resp>

This spot is legit. 👌 Great food & great service! It's walking distance in Old Town with a free lot nearby. This came with rice & beans that I hardly touched bc this bucket was so filling. I opted to upgrade the corn to the Mexican street corn that is made just like an elote on the cob. They also have a free chip & salsa bar where the chips are under a heat lamp. They provide little containers for different salsas, extra lemons, bean salads etc.. huge variety. I highly recommend the pineapple mango salsa. It was.. probably the best thing I've ever had. I ate it with the chips & also added it to my crab, lobster & shrimp tacos. Oh! Forgot to mention they give you warm tortillas 😋 the Margarita was pretty good too. The live music was super fun.
Overall.. this is definitely a spot worth trying. You will not regret it.
When I'm back in San Diego in a few months, I'll definitely be back.< /text>

I usually love coming to this restaurant. The food is excellent the majority of the time. This time, however was different. I ordered the surf & turf tacos. They forgot the surf, the turf wasn't seasoned at all (very bland), and the meal wasn't hot. Like I said, it's not usually this sad....hopefully they can provide a better experience next time.< /Review>

<Review>Taco Tuesday deals run all day so we decided on this place over others in the old town, where deals only start post 3, 4pm. There were four specials (all $3 except one was $2), some drink specials and an ample salsa bar with chips. As a seafood place, the blackened fish taco certainly stood out most.</Review><name>Ariel C.< /name><GmapID>0x80deaade206267a3:0x3e05f6215d552d43<//GmapID><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaun5Yp2DQ8xO_XRdS6oWbs25kxmhFQVgqJSPZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvUH352kMo6EWSTjbDMVG8QyyHKvPaCDYjPVkb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics></record>

Best place in San Diego to have tex mex/surf & turf style food. We've been going to this place for so long. Always a nostalgic place to visit since we used to live in SD many years ago. Food is 5/5 and ambiance 5/5 and service is 5/5.< /text>

Popped in to Rockin’ Baja by chance trying to find a shop just outside the Old Town Park area. We had put our names in at the popular restaurants with an hour and twenty min wait, so we took a chance walked up to Rockin’ Baja and were seated right away.  The restaurant is very large and can easily accommodate groups.  We enjoyed the live music, pitcher of Cadillac margaritas, salsa bar and our food. Everyone was pleased with what they ordered.<//text>

Experience felt rushed, menu had incorrect items, and check was brought to us very quickly - without asking if we were ready to close. Seafood was good, skip the rice, tastes very acidic, steak was subpar and their cheese tasted sour. Normally, I have a good experience here, but this time wasn’t very pleasant. Waitress was nice but attempted to pick a fight regarding the menu that clearly stated a drink I asked for couldn’t be served the way it was advertised on the menu. Would go again, but only if in the area or with someone else paying. Not worth the money.</review>

We love this place, I wish it was back here in Arizona. The prices are up there but we feel the atmosphere made it worth always coming back to.

They have a salsa bar with quite the variety where you can help yourself. The dinner plates are HUGE and I had to take home half of my plate so be warned. The drinks are a bit much, it was $12 for a glass here compared to the same size at other places we frequent but you can always order the special, which seemed to be around $6-$8.

I can't tell you the food is amazing because I usually eat a ton of salsa then only have a burrito. But I can tell you that they added vegan/veterinarian options which was the main reason we wanted to come back in the first place. You can get the beyond meat with nearly anything instead of actual meat. The down side is, it costs way more to do so. If a veggie burrito was $14, chicken would be $15, seafood $16, red meat $17, Beyond Beef ("fake" meat) $18. The burrito took me 2 dinners to eat it all but my husband ate it in one sitting. Anyways, be prepared to pay more than your typical restaurant.< /Review>

<rate>4<//rate><text>A fantastic Mexican restaurant, whose signature is seafood, especially lobster. There are variety of Mexican beers and Margaritas. These Mexican drinks are really matched with Mexican salsas. I just came back from Mexicali at that moment, but nothing was different from that of real Mexican and enjoyed a lot even after big lunch there.<//text>< Pictures>

Service took a hit like most restaurants including getting an extra salsa cup that when opened, contained nothing because it was a used one from another table.
Food is still good and plentiful.
Still can't sit at the bar as of 30OCT.<//Text>

The service is great, even in these weird times of Covid. I loved this place even before I stepped foot in the restaurant.  As soon as you near, the big green gate and neon lights welcome you as if you were in a small town outside of Rosarito. Great place to watch a game or just throw back a few drinks.<//review>

<text>Wife and I often come to this restaurant for our Get Away Weekend's. We always have an excellent experience here! On this occasion, during the Level Red CoVid opening we wondered if our experience was going to be worth the expense, this restaurant was Spot On! With the assistance of our Server, Raul, all our needs were met and our dining experience was perfect! Thanks Raul and Thank you Rockin' Baja! Great as always.< /text>< pictures>

Only suggestion is, I think the staff should ask if they would like chips and salsa. Since it is not out, for obvious resaons. I asked my server if they have it and he said their manager says it will only be on request. I dont understand that because some people are far too timid to speak up sometimes plus it was a free self serve item.

<Review>Overall a very nice place to eat, most of the food is good, but some of the meats can be dry. This place is often busy and hard to find a place to park. So it can be better to park far and walk, this is a place that will surely leave lasting memories on your trips.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNihaMK8YjYgcN0SEcaFbKf53AmQzUwVNtcJ4T5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Good drinks good food fun atmosphere. Love the all you can eat chips and salsa bar with the mango salsa!  They also have a photographer going around taking your pictures. They'll give you a freebie small picture and the option to buy a nice souvenir one.</text>

Just a fun all purpose restaurant in a great area. Lots of different and interesting dining areas in a house that is a historic landmark. Loved it!</Review>

Nice place. Service is very poor, food not to good. My wife had to have them take her plate back, they said they would take it off the bill and caught them still trying to charge us. They seem lost. Don't know what they are doing. Not to mention the bartender,  wearing clothing not suitable for anyone more so our children.  Very unprofessional.<//Review>

Our go to place to eat when in SD. While there are other Rockin Baja's in CA this location is by far THE BEST one. The food is always hot and fresh, the service is awesome and the ambiance is super cute and chill. The buckets are amazing, you get what you pay for (come hungry). Also, they have the best fried ice cream. The food will not disappoint.<//review>

Great food and customer service. The food was amazing. Very delicious. Highly recommend. I suggest valet parking due to limited parking in the area. There is a lot that charges $5 but it is difficult to get your car out if the lot has several cars.< /Review>

Sea of Cortez bucket which has“Baja Style” Lobster Tails And Shrimp With Sweet Snow Crab was a great choice. Also got the chamango-rita and churros for dessert. The tables were spaced far enough apart for social distancing. We also had made a reservation which I highly recommend and were able to reserve a table outside to enjoy some nice evening weather while we ate. Service was great and we enjoyed our time.</text>

GLUTEN FREE BEWARE- Went in for dinner tonight and before ordering our drinks I asked the waiter if there were gluten free options and was told I could have any seafood just stay away from chicken or steak. I ordered  grilled shrimp, fries and coleslaw. I received boiled shrimp, corn, rice and beans. I was then told I couldn’t eat the rice and beans because of gluten. I ended up getting to eat  boiled shrimp for $30.00.  This used to be our families favorite restaurant, I won’t be back.</review>

<review>We needed a quick and inexpensive lunch spot for the whole family today and happened upon this place just in time for "Taco Tuesday". The tacos were delicious, ranging from $2-$3/ea. The place included a complimentary chips and salsa bar with a variety of yummy salsas.  It hit the spot and didn't break the bank. Plus the atmosphere and decor was pleasing to the eye and fun for the kids.< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>My wife and I brought friends from out of town here on Friday night. It was honestly a huge miscalculation, because one of the three kids with us is autistic, and he's a bit sound sensitive. Shortly after we arrived, the live band was playing, and it got kind of loud, on top of being a busy restaurant. My heart sank, and we were totally prepared to bail if our friend couldn't handle it.

He actually had a great time! It turns out that he was recently starting to enjoy music, and he started grooving along to the band. Our server Shawn was great as well. Super attentive, and really nice to the kids, making them feel like part of the situation.

There was a really nice woman walking around taking photos, but unfortunately I didn't catch her name. She snapped photos of our group, and came back shortly with prints. I was prepared to buy them no matter how they turned out.

The photos are freaking excellent. Really nice prints in San Diego themed frames, professional composition and lighting or whatever photographers say when things turn out just right. We are so happy to have that night captured for us to remember. Seriously, she did a great job.

Thanks so much for helping us have a really special, memorable night.</text>< UserId.>

Good food! Great lobster bites and Street Tacos! I gave 4 stars because it took about 15 minutes to get my bar drink and they were not busy at the time.</text>

< review>
Went here with my daughter,  brother,  and mom (it was my bro's 50th birthday). We  weren't aware that you could sign up online prior to your birthday to get a baja bucket. I split the Baja Bucket with my 15 year olds daughter. It comes with Rock lobster(MY FAVE), shrimp, chicken, carne asada steak cutlets, tortillas,  rice, and beans. ALSO unlimited salsa bar and very yummy authentic tortilla chips. Perfect for 2 people. We have pretty good appetites and still had a couple shrimp left over.  We sat right near the indoor waterfall which was s nice touch. Parking lot was full but I managed to squeeze into a non-working spot, lol. I'm a rebel that way because I'm impatient and I'd be darned if I was gonna pay $5 to park in the adjoining lot. It's not a romantic place. It's busy. Seating is courtyard style but no complaints. Good vibes. Good drinks. Good food...<//review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Pretty good Mexican restaurant in San Diego. This place is right on the edge of Old Town, and the food here is decent. They have a self serve chip and salsa bar, which I like. Our server was friendly and helpful, although the seating process was a rock rocky. The prices were a bit high, but it is a tourist area, and they do include an automatic 3% gratuity on top of what you tip. The portions are pretty huge; we stuffed ourselves and took some home. They also have a person taking photos and selling the prints, which adds to the touristy element. However, they really didn't try to force that on you. Bottom line, this was a good stop for lunch, but not without warts.</review>< pictures>

I on the other hand ordered the fish and chips. Didn't really enjoy it though. I thought it was a little too plain. Cooked well but NO flavor what so ever. Had to add plenty of Tartar sauce to somewhat enjoy what I was eating. Sweet tea was a plus with a squeeze of lemon.</Review><date>1565048451774<//date>< pictures>

Server Stephanie was great, but food was a huge disappointment for the flavor and price. We came from Albuquerque and have had better seafood in the desert. Very disappointed. The online menu listed several items that were not on this menu here. I mean no shrimp cocktail, so sad.<//text>

<text>Great food and customer service. The food was amazing. Very delicious. Highly recommend. I suggest valet parking due to limited parking in the area. There is a lot that charges $5 but it is difficult to get your car out if the lot has several cars.</text>< date>

<Review>Beautiful set up! This place feels like you crossed the border and stepped right into baja. Great drinks, huge margaritas and their salsa bar is out of this world with about 12 different salsas and dips to choose from. Highly recommend the tequila lime shrimp.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80deaade206267a3:0x3e05f6215d552d43</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Great food with a fun atmosphere and happy staff.  A casual setting with both indoor and outdoor seating and live music on the weekends.  I love this place and their food... lots and lots of seafood choices.   It's a great alternative to other more traditional Mexican restaurants in old town San Diego. Insider tip: this is a great spot for happy hour or dinner if you're from out of town.  They have a large menu,  big dishes and fun seafood buckets that you can share. Tacos are excellent here especially the shrimp and lobster tacos!</Review>

The food and cocktails were great.  The Rib Eye Tacos were awesome.  It wasn't very busy but it had a good vibe.  Service started out good but went down hill.  Our server disappeared and it took 20 minutes to get our bill.  Maybe an off night?  It was a bit over priced but we'd go back again.<//Review>

Good tacos! I ordered the blackened fish tacos and my boyfriend ordered the soft shell crab tacos ( he inhaled them before i could get a good pic). The service was pretty fast ~30 mins through uber eats. I was in town for only a few days so I was glad to find a place that offered such a great tasting taco with Seafood via delivery service!< /Review>

I had the lobster tacos. They're very good but a little on the spicy side for my liking. Service was quick the food arrived quickly but the place is very loud. My server was very attentive to my needs and checked on me frequently. The beer was cold. Worth the visit if you don't mind the noise.<//text>

Delicious fish tacos, lobster, and mexican style corn on the cob. They were amazing by making the happy hour tacos gluten free for me at no extra charge. Margaritas are good but I would recommend asking for slightly less sweet.< /review>

It was good! Drinks were smooth. (I sawa few reviews say they were watered down. Had me worried. Maybe different bartender...)  Lobster bites were on point. Tacos! Damn! That's all I gotta say. Lol. Philly steak tacos and Tres amigos tacos..... On point! Shrimp taquitos were on point, but the edges were way too crispy. (maybe cooked a lil too long). A legit cantina. Decor was dope. Overall, spot was good! Will go again.<//review>

<text>Came here a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The food was very good. The chip and salsa bar had many differ options. The mango salsa was very well done. We got a big bucket for two and the shrimp and lobster were amazing. Cooked to perfection. The stake and chicken was seasoned well.<//text><Response>None< /Response><date>1547942158028< /date></record></dataset><record>

<text>You would think that with the word "lobster" actually in the name of the restaurant that they would know how to cook lobster well.  Not so! I had the Maine Lobster roll and it was dry, chewy, overcooked and it totally lacked the signature sweetness that you expect from real Maine lobster.  This seemed to have some sort of blend of langostino meat, CA spiny lobster and "maybe" some Maine.  Maybe...  Regardless of what is actually in it, there is no excusing how poorly it was prepared.  Lacking that, consider this just a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.</text>< pictures>

Beautiful outside seating area with a live musician, a large salsa bar, Margaritas were off the hook. Food was delicious. Great for kids and large groups. There is a full bar and the restrooms can accommodate up to 6 ladies at a time. I would definitely come back< /Text>

I love lobster tacos. The lobsters with claws is nothing I’m used to. I like the traditional West Coast lobster best (w/o claws). However lobster tacos are really fantastic, the way I make my own. I loved Rockin Baja Lobster for a very long time since when I first arrived in San Diego in 2002.</text>

<Review>Great food!
My wife and I ate there before when we were visiting the area and it was a good visit both times.
Food was great and plentiful.
Drinks were great and worth the price.

The server did mess up my wife's order by bringing the wrong meal. She excepted the meal he brought but he also tried to tell her that the beans he brought were Ranchero beans and they weren't.

The $6 for valet parking for people eating there seems a little odd.<//Review><user_id>106882248942383287499</user_id><username>Charles Ridgeway< /username>< Time>

Very good time. This is definitely a tourist heavy location but the food and service is excellent . A must is the 60 dollar meal for two. It's awesome with a bit of everything.</text>

I had the lobster tacos. They're very good but a little on the spicy side for my liking. Service was quick the food arrived quickly but the place is very loud. My server was very attentive to my needs and checked on me frequently. The beer was cold. Worth the visit if you don't mind the noise.</Text>

< Review>
Beautiful set up! This place feels like you crossed the border and stepped right into baja. Great drinks, huge margaritas and their salsa bar is out of this world with about 12 different salsas and dips to choose from. Highly recommend the tequila lime shrimp.</Review>

<Review>We almost walked out the moment we were seated and the waiter walked up to the table, dropped off glasses of water, then walked away without even acknowledging us. This was only the beginning of the lackluster service. I had to ask to order a drink. He took forever to do everything but bring the bill. The food some what made up for the poor service. We ordered the Big Baja bucket for two. The steak and rice were excellent; the chicken, shrimp, and lobster were ok. The service and the food were not worth the price we paid. This place was recommend to us. I would not come here again and would caution others against coming here.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80deaade206267a3:0x3e05f6215d552d43< /GmapID></record>

If you're a tourist in Old Town trying to decide between Fred's and Cafe Coyote and here, you should go here. If you're a local you're probably not in Old Town and you probably know better places to go that cost a lot less money, unless it's a holiday...</review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Seafood feast!  Very good food,  nice atmosphere.   Even as a local I wouldn't call it worthy of being a regular but nice for a change of pace on the Mexican side of dining.   Tourists should love it, locals should revisir< /Review>

Love the live music while you eat. At times this is not a place to have a conversation with friends and family. The food is good I enjoyed the lobster bisque but others that ordered it at the table had inconsistent soups. One was more watery than another and some were more broth than others. Loved the salsa bar the mango salsa was really nice. Drinks were well made also.<//Text>

<review>The food was amazing, the wait was a little long and it was a bit pricey. The service was fast and attentive. Other then then the price, I will definitely recommend this place. Try the lobster corn chowder! Thumbs up for me.</review>< Time>

The food was delicious,  the server was amazing.  He recommended a margarita that was really good.  If you go you have to try the cilantro lime margarita or the smoky BlackBerry margarita.  The shrimp was fresh, the lobster bisque was delicious!<//Text>

<Review>Such a great place to visit and eat at for a fulfilling meal! Really recommend coming here and eating with the family. I am definitely coming back and telling all my friends about here! If you happen to visit, make sure to get the fried cereal (you can thank me later)!<//Review>< gmap_id>

Our server was really sweet and friendly, and our food was pretty tasty. You get a lot, so make sure you share a plate with someone. One of the hostesses was not very friendly,  but other than that, we enjoyed our visit.< /Text>

We love Rockin' Baja Lobster. The food here is always great. If you're looking for a TJ-like dining experience look no further.
Friendly staff and patio, as well as indoor, dining. An added plus is that they are pet friendly.< /Review>

They've got a chips and salsa bar with all different kinds of salsa - we had one with mango in it that was really good!
The temperature outside was just perfect for the covered restaurant, and the ambiance was fun with a little waterfall rock structure. The restaurant is perfect for families!
The drinks were very expensive, and the fork tines were bent.
The food was delicious and very filling - I had plenty left over!
Our waitress was nice until the check came - she was irritated about having to split the check but obliged.< /text>< Pics>

I love the little Baja lobsters that they serve here. I usually get the Baja Bucket since it has lobsters, shrimps, chicken and steak with beans and rice on the side. The price is reasonable too, it only cost $24 for the bucket. Every time I came to this restaurant in Old Town, I don't have to wait long to be seated. The service has been very good so far.</text>

Food was totally delicious! Chip bar and salsas completely diverse and worth trip! Buckets great way to try many delights. Their only downfall was the service, seemed like they were short handed and too many people running about clueless. Enjoyed it otherwise and once we got food and chip bar was filled all was Good!< /Review>

< Review>
Unfortunately, our dinner experience was no where near what we were expecting. We decided to take our family that was visiting from out of town for a fun/nice dinner and didn't have the best experience right from the start. We arrived at 4:30 pm and there was no one waiting so we walked right up to the hostess stand and let her know we had a party of 5. She proceeded to ask us is we minded a tall table. We let her know that would be fine and she asked us to give her a couple of minutes. The hostess seemed to be more concerned about socializing with staff and seemed to forget that we were sitting right in front of her waiting. After around 15 minutes of waiting, two ladies walked up, were asked if they minded a tall table, and they were immediately taken to be seated. I then took it apon myself to take a peak in the restaurant where there were open tables everywhere. So I walked back to the hostess stand and spoke with another hostess which could not locate our name written down anywhere. She apologized, took us to the bar seating area, and sat us next to the women that came in 15 minutes after us (they were at the same side table as us). After this, we were happy to have a nice server but still upset about the unnecessary wait. On the way out, we stopped at the hostess stand and asked for a few wet naps as we ordered the ribs, and she told us it would take a few minutes. We declined and left the restaurant pretty surprised with the service. I have worked in the restaurant business for years and could never imagine treating guests in this way. This was such a bummer!!</Review>

One of the best meal's I have had & we like nice food. The young man that waited on us was excellent never rushed us. Brought out 5 or 6 things one at a time. The "bucket" was incredible.  Our little girl loved all the bird's in the big bird bath.</Text>

This place used to be AWESOME.. However they recently changed the menu and some of the preparation of the food. For example the Jambalaya used to be very Creole and semi-authentic... However now it's just Alfredo sauce with shrimp. The shrimp buckets are still good but i was disappointed at my last visit<//review>

I got the seafood enchilada and now I will probably never want one again in life after getting sick the way I did. The margaritas are good though.

It started pretty good ordered our bucket of beer, water, ordered our food told us we had refills I think of rice and beans plus tortillas something like that but guess what it took us to our main entree to be done to finally getting her attention of the waitress for some more beans with tortillas plus another bucket of beers. Besides that she only came back to drop off our tab. I've been here before with huge parties and they are pretty good with service but for a couple I guess they tend to forget about you.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80deaade206267a3:0x3e05f6215d552d43</gmapID></record>

I went there with my family for our vacation tonight. To start we were really excited but we ended up spotting giant cockroaches. The restaurant was mostly outside so I guess it was inevitable but they were pretty much infested. We were eating and one jumped on my foot. They were also jumping onto our table. They did move us into the restaurant and offered me fried ice cream with churros. They never actually brought it. Overall the staff was okay but they obviously could have brought the food that they promised. not worth $125.< /text>

If you like seafood this is the place to go! Delicious seafood taste in every bite. Our waitress was extremely nice and assisted us with our decision making. The chips and variety of salsa was good the mango pineapple salsa was amazing. The portion for the price was excellent. Would recommend this place at any time.<//text>

This place was amazing! Great food and the service was prompt.   Margarita was a little weak at 1st, but our waiter Juan came back with a shot to fix it.  Great ambiance, decor and music.  I'd definitely go back.<//Text>

Loved it! Excellent place for well seasoned food! They serve a LOT if alcohol so be forewarned. The food price is reasonable for what you get. It is very loud, but cheerful. I used valet parking in front of Restaurant,  otherwise hard to park. I will go again next time I'm in San Diego.</Review>

With the covid 19 spread and the necessities to take serious actions in keeping everything clean! I got a dirty cup and silverware, and when I complained to the manager he didn’t like it, he snitched it out of my hand and said he sorry.
If I get sick! Sorry won’t cut it<//text>

June was really prompt and she even recommended HAPPY HOUR tacos and the drink was an orgasm to my taste buds.  Thanks June for your courteous service and the drink was awesome.

6/24/2019: Terre's service was awesome but I'm too early for Happy Hour Tacos.
Thanks for prompt service.</review>

Normally we go on the weekend when we are in town but this time we ended up going on a Monday night. The portions are very nice you won't leave hungry especially with the chip and salsa bar. But the food was very over cooked. We had the seafood basket for 2 with shrimp, steak, chicken, corn. Also the photographer who takes your pics walked by us for an hour and never once asked to take our photo. Not sure we will go back<//text>

The food wasn't very good, everything was drenched in oil. We came here for lunch and left and went somewhere else to eat for lunch that actually tastes good.
However, if you're looking for a bar that has sea food then this is where you go.< /text>

Having lived in San Diego for four years I am a big fan of Mexican food. This place has it all - great burritos, tacos, lobsters, beer, surrounded by awesome Mexican live music. Very close to the old town historic park for a nice walk, in case you’ve eaten too much.<//text>

It was late on a Thursday night and the place was quiet. I ordered the crispy fish tacos and was very happy! My friends shared the ceviche, also nice. And they got lobster tacos and shrimp fajitas to split. We ordered two fried ice creams for dessert and were sent to heaven!! Drinks were decent and the horchata is good but no refills. We really liked the AYCE chips and salsa bar because there was great variety in salsa choices! We will definitely return when we come to San Diego! Shout out to our excellent server Cristobal!< /text>

<Text>Well we all know that this place is always busy especially waiting to be seated but it shouldn't feel that way when you are seated. It started pretty good ordered our bucket of beer, water, ordered our food told us we had refills I think of rice and beans plus tortillas something like that but guess what it took us to our main entree to be done to finally getting her attention of the waitress for some more beans with tortillas plus another bucket of beers. Besides that she only came back to drop off our tab. I've been here before with huge parties and they are pretty good with service but for a couple I guess they tend to forget about you.< /Text>< user>

<review>Unfortunately, our dinner experience was no where near what we were expecting. We decided to take our family that was visiting from out of town for a fun/nice dinner and didn't have the best experience right from the start. We arrived at 4:30 pm and there was no one waiting so we walked right up to the hostess stand and let her know we had a party of 5. She proceeded to ask us is we minded a tall table. We let her know that would be fine and she asked us to give her a couple of minutes. The hostess seemed to be more concerned about socializing with staff and seemed to forget that we were sitting right in front of her waiting. After around 15 minutes of waiting, two ladies walked up, were asked if they minded a tall table, and they were immediately taken to be seated. I then took it apon myself to take a peak in the restaurant where there were open tables everywhere. So I walked back to the hostess stand and spoke with another hostess which could not locate our name written down anywhere. She apologized, took us to the bar seating area, and sat us next to the women that came in 15 minutes after us (they were at the same side table as us). After this, we were happy to have a nice server but still upset about the unnecessary wait. On the way out, we stopped at the hostess stand and asked for a few wet naps as we ordered the ribs, and she told us it would take a few minutes. We declined and left the restaurant pretty surprised with the service. I have worked in the restaurant business for years and could never imagine treating guests in this way. This was such a bummer!!</review>< pics>

I got food poisoning from the salsa bar. It was specifically the salsa with beans. I was the only person in my party who ate it and was the only person the get food poisoning. I got the seafood enchilada and now I will probably never want one again in life after getting sick the way I did. The margaritas are good though. Just eat at your own risk I guess.< /review>

<Text>My family loved coming here! Super fun environment and the salsa bar you have access to is delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the seafood bucket I got, the meats weren't a bit dry to my liking and I wasn't a huge fan of the cajun/jambalaya seasons so I would know to get something else for me personally next time.< /Text><Response>None</Response>< username>

Food was bit too high on salt. Ok ambience and service. Lobster entrees were priced average and tasted ok. However, gloves/bib not provided with lobster.< /Review>

Our server was Shawn, and he did everything right, from a warm greeting, to delicious recomdations, to being attentive and meeting our needs, to getting us our check in a timely manor. The atmosphere here is awesome, and Shawn did a really good job adding to it. The food was delicious!< /Text>

Would I have been satisfied with just the salsa bar? Yes. Nevertheless, I proceeded to consume a delicious bucket of seafood. Five assorted mini-cups of salsa out of five.< /review>

<Review>Went on a family vacation and you can tell we're all over 21 but tell me why we were all carded after 1 person bought 2 drinks. "She" bought the first drink of the night, it was too spicy. So she ordered a different one and the waitress was like yeah no problem. "She" ran into another waitress and asked about her drink I mean "she" ordered it 15-20 minutes ago. So waitress 2 said idk what's going on but I will check well "she" changes her mind and now wants a different drink to replace drink #1. The 2 drinks arrive and boom we all get carded. It's not our fault that waitress left the spicy on that "she" didnt want on the table and the other 2 ordered 15-20 minutes apart go there at the same time. Good food just slow service.<//Review>< pics>

<text>Nice environment,  deaf bartenders, just average steak and chicken. Far overpriced, I could have spent $100 at least 10 other restaurants and gotten a better meal.  If the meal and drinks were $60 maybe but not in the same league as other restaurants for their prices.
I was advised by a friend of mine the place was nice but the food, the steak and lobster wasn't worth the hype.  I should have listened.

I just ate an amazing steak and meal at Bo-beau in Hillcrest with my date and this steak wasn't even close. It appeared the meat was of much lower quality. I've had better steak and chicken at 80%  of taco shops in San Diego.  The meat was so tough like  I was eating beef jerky, the drinks were weak and the place just is not in the same league as other places in old Town or San Diego .<//text><Rating>1<//Rating><date>1545888121193<//date>< Response>

Food is good but service sucks.  Have been a couple times due to friends in town.  First time, good food but service super slow, I wrote it off to having a large group and it being a busy night.  The next 3 times I went the service was equally bad even when they weren't busy and it was just three of us.  Don't waste your time and money.<//Review>

Great food and great service. I live in Phoenix, AZ. Everytime I'm in San Diego I make sure I stop and eat here. I think I was the first one to try their ribs and they were AMAZING!!< /text>

Great place to eat for a week day dinner! The Big Baja Bucket was definitely big enough for two. LOVE the chip and salsa bar idea. Chips come lightly seasoned for an added bonus. Will definitely eat here again and bring others too<//text>

Food was good but the lobster sampler was not that special. Had left overs the next day it was stinking up the drive. I had to throw it out. Must have been already going bad. We didn't get sick tho.< /Text>

We came in last night for my Birthday (party of 20 ) . We had 1 server and don’t know if she was having a bad day or what (not my problem) but she was clearly not Happy about taking our order . My daughter ordered a pasta dish with shrimp and was asked if she was allergic to fish? They obviously made it with shrimp and took it to the kitchen and just picked the shrimp out . CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A LOST ART ! I think she was put out that we split checks and wouldn’t get the tip . Well here’s a tip we are in sales and would have OVER TIPPED HER if there was a smile and just a little service besides her serving a table of 20 . WAKE UP GM .... DO YOUR JOB 👊<//Text>

Over priced tacos with lack of flavor.  Also menu was printed 4 days ago with a statement that a 4 percent surcharge to help cover the cost of food.  You also cant order certain drink specicials unless your at the bar or patio but u cant order food their...honestly too many side rules for what it is.  Go to mexico instead border is 15 minutes away if you time it right and half the price.  Drinks were ok waitor though made up for the experience.< /review>

Shared a birthday here the staff was helpful and the food had great portions. We loved the salsa bar and fresh tortilla chips. The only downside in my opinion was the parking. Overall it was a great experience</Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>Went on a family vacation and you can tell we're all over 21 but tell me why we were all carded after 1 person bought 2 drinks. "She" bought the first drink of the night, it was too spicy. So she ordered a different one and the waitress was like yeah no problem. "She" ran into another waitress and asked about her drink I mean "she" ordered it 15-20 minutes ago. So waitress 2 said idk what's going on but I will check well "she" changes her mind and now wants a different drink to replace drink #1. The 2 drinks arrive and boom we all get carded. It's not our fault that waitress left the spicy on that "she" didnt want on the table and the other 2 ordered 15-20 minutes apart go there at the same time. Good food just slow service.<//Review>< Name>

Food was highly overpriced for what was served. The band they had playing was way too loud and they sounded like garbage. We had to rush out of there due to some of us getting headaches.< /text>

This place exceeded my expectations, which were high based on a friend's recommendation.  If you like crab and lobster, get the Cortez bucket.  With all the sides, one bucket is enough for two.  The snow crab, especially, is better than any I've had elsewhere - thick, juicy chunks and seasoned so they are delicious with or without drawn butter.  Overall one of the best seafood restaurants I've ever been to.  We'll be back again!<//Text>

Little pricey and touristy But over all not badd good portions. Not thrilled about the 4% surcharge I normally don't go to those places that do that period or I reflected in the tip. Service was just OK<//review>

I went here for a business function and I have to say- the service was excellent and the food was SUPER GOOD! I shared a huge bucket with my boyfriend and it was all so good- crab legs, shrimp, lobster... Nice inviting atmosphere here as well. I would recommend for a party or just a good time eating great food!<//Review>

You're lucky if you find street parking. Although they have their own parking lot you will pay valet service in order to park during peak hours.

Food is good. Nothing extraordinary. They have better drinks then they have food. The salsa bar is probably my favorite. Don't forget to ask for the chili honey butter, that is delicious!<//Text><rate>3</rate><username>Jennah Lee Bolosan< /username>< Gmap_id>

I am rewriting my past review and downgrading my rating sadly. After going here for several years now, we noticed a lot of greedy things from this restaurant. In the summertime, their tacos go from normal size to tiny street taco bite size WITH the same price. Now, their happy hour prices went from great to aweful. Lobster bites and margaritas were affordable but now stupid for happy hour prices, and we waited to eat until the 9:00 start time. So now we have left the restaurant STARVING.</Review>

<Text>The food was okay, it sucked that they don't offer FRESH BREWED TEA.  What made the night very pleasing was the company I was with.< /Text>< Time>

The wait can be long so get a reservation if you are going during peak hours. Prepare to pay for parking be it valet or lot parking. You're lucky if you find street parking. Although they have their own parking lot you will pay valet service in order to park during peak hours.

Food is good. Nothing extraordinary. They have better drinks then they have food. The salsa bar is probably my favorite. Don't forget to ask for the chili honey butter, that is delicious!</review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>My older sister, my girlfriend, and I were in San Diego to go see Sunset Cliffs. This restaurant was very beautiful. The restaurant had really good drinks and various types of salsa and unlimited tortilla chips. I got the Carne Asada & Lobster Tampiqueña without cheese and sour cream. It was a very succulent meal, I highly recommend going to this restaurant.< /text>< Pictures>

Our new spot in San Diego, the food was great, the steamed clams were to die for and they had a killer salsa bar. The drinks were good and the service was ok. Definitely looking forward to going back.< /Review>

<Text>I love this place, getting the buckets with a variety of foods is the best way to go. I took my wife there when we were dating and we both loved it. Service was very good and they make sure you have everything you need, TV's throughout so you dont miss your favorite game. A must try. Old town has easier parking</Text>< pictures>

We come every trip... Was very disappointed this time. We always rave about the awesome food and atmosphere. So we brought family and.... Server was nothing short of awesome BUT steak was burnt and kitchen closed so the unlimited refill and getting orders fixed couldn't happen. A group of 16 showed up at 9:30. They close at 11. Very very disappointed this time.</Review>

Mediocore food and expensive given the food. Cheese quesadilla was like $11 with some white cheese and a funky taste white spread in it. Blackened fish taco was ok (3 for $16). On the good side they have a good salsa bar.
Be aware they charge an extra 3% for whatever reason (they mentioned on the menu).
Valet parking only and costs $6<//review>

<Review>Crowded but nice patio. Great chips and salsa bar. I should have ordered just that. I received a coupon for 10% off from the Courtyard Marriott Hotel nearby. Had the mushroom fajitas. It was ok. Nothing special. Didn't seem fresh. My friends seemed to enjoy their drinks and food. But all agreed that it's not worth the money.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

This is a great place if you like seafood and Mexican food.  It's better to reserve a spot if you go on the weekends. My suggestion is to get a table by the waterfall its the nicest spot.< /review>

<user_name>Amanda Jahanvash<//user_name><Review>Fun, festive Mexican restaurant and bar.
Strawberry blended margaritas are the best!
Food is good, servers are friendly and attentive.
Drinks are excellent. Location is good. In Old Town with valet parking for only $5. Can't beat that! Atmosphere is fun. Not too loud.
Great place for a fun time with friends. Love the outdoor patio.
I hope to return soon.</Review><user>111052260769008689033<//user></record></dataset><record>

A chain, it was ok. Maybe a little overpriced.  The server kept pushing the expensive sharing basket which became annoying the 3rd time he suggested it<//Text>

Good place. Back patio for hanging out with friends. Beer and grilled seafood. The basic Baja Bucket for two can feed four people.  Shrimp, little lobsters,  beef, chicken ,tortillas,  rice, beans, butter seasoned with spices.  Yummy.</review>

<review>I've had menu items that I've really enjoyed (some kind of lobster lovers combo) and other items that were just okay (one of their burritos).
They offer an all you can eat chip bar that's self serve, with a nice selection of salsas including a sweet mango salsa.
One thing I'm not entirely fond of at this place is that there's always a person that goea around to each table and takes pictures that they then try to sell you at the end of your meal.< /review>< Pictures>

I love king crab legs and these were so tasty! I wasn't expecting much when my fiance brought me here for king crab legs, but the crab legs, the rest of the food and our margarita was really delicious! We both would definitely go here again when we are in the San Diego area!</Text>

Really bad dull food. Mac and cheese taste worst than straight out a cardboard box,  avocado burger 🤮 ,,yet the three amigos was just plain ok. For the price I would of expected flavored thick fries instead of the store bought shoestring plain fries 🤢🤢. 1st time and last time there.. not good at all.<//review>

Salsa bar was fresh, margarita tasty, service excellent.  My only issue was the tacos I ordered.  The carne asada was very dry.  My friend's chicken tacos were also dry.  However all the other people in the party had dishes that looked amazing.</Text>

<text>Great atmosphere with large portions of food. The free chips and salsa are a huge plus. My only complaint is how expensive the food is. That being said, you do get a lot of food for your money. I prefer this location over the gaslamp location as it's a little more secluded and not as busy.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80deaade206267a3:0x3e05f6215d552d43</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>Live in Az but have been here on every trip to San Diego for years.  Just my son and I tonight and it was great. The only thing you have to know is that parking was valet only ($6) at the restaurant, otherwise pay to public park.  The food was amazing, the service was great and the RBL always has a great vibe to it.  I had the blackened fish tacos and my kiddo had the burger.  Tried the churros after and they topped it all off! Try this place.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Very cool place to eat.  The seafood was delicious however the only reason that i gave them 4 stars is because the chicken and steak were rubbery tasting and questionably even looked like real meat.  Other than that the lobster and shrimp were phenomenal.<//Review>

Not the best chef perhaps, on this occasion. Had the Baja Bucket for 2, seafood wasn't cooked enough... was a little rubbery. I have had this a couple times before and it was pretty great. Otherwise,  I would have given only 2 stars based on the last visit alone. I will still give them another try< /text>

Absolutely amazing food! The room was so loud we couldn't hear each other though. That was a huge downside, since we were there to celebrate my brother's 21st birthday and screaming "What??" to each other after every sentence killed the mood. Turn the TVs down!<//text>

<review>Service was good. I did not like the fact that I ordered a fish taco and it came with hot sauce. I asked that they not put it on and they told me no substitutions
I wasn't asking for a substitution only not to add something. At least they changed their parking practice. They used to charge $5 for parking only on Taco Tuesday only and I'm handicapped
This is only about greed. Shame on you
I used to bring large groups here but no more their are plenty of other restaurants in Old Town

$125 mistake!  Visiting so won't be making this mistake again.  Maybe something else is good here but we didnt get.  The surf and turf tacos would be better if they used better tortillas.  The meat and shrimp inside taco was ok.  Lobster Roll and fries was not good.   Service was ok at best.<//text>

We always enjoy visiting here withbh friends.  I like to get the Baja bucket to share with my wife.  They often have music on the weekends too.  This is a great place to bring kids because it's casual and rather loud to begin with.  This is not fine dining, but it is a good time.<//review>

Love their salsa bar! The one place you will go that has tons of salsa selections and self serve so you can keep going back haha..😋 For the meals, It's best to get 1 or 2 buckets if you have a group of people, you get chicken, carne asada, shrimp, lobster tail and then rice beans and tortillas to make tacos and stuff.

Also Old Town location has better ambience than downtown, it's a cool environment in there😎<//review>

<review>The ceviche was okaay, my son’s quesadillas were okaay, and my husband liked his Taste of Baja Bucket. Our chips and guacamole that we ordered as a side came out with the meal so we barely ate it, but maybe that was also because it looked like it had been sitting out for a while, and had no taste. I’d never normally complain about iced tea, but it’s so hard to get it wrong and they did. Our service was friendly but we didn’t see much of her. Overall, totally mediocre, and especially for the price.</review>< Name>

Food was good but was disappointed that we couldn't order anything from the happy hour menu posted out front. We had a party 7 and we all wanted some nacho' s but could not order any since we got a table. The waiter never explained that we had to  get up and get our own chips and salsa, we noticed that others were getting them for themselves. Also they do have a parking lot but everyone coming to the restaurant had to pay the valet parking fee even though we parked ourselves. We will not be going back to this location again.<//Review>

If you want seafood in Old Town San Diego...this is your place!

Service wasn't always 5 star but the food makes it worth it. I've been here a few times and I think it's worth the visit.< /text>

I took the Wifey here,                                          Man let me tell you (Golden sombrero bucket)Lobster was sweet and juicy paid about $100 for this platter. came with rice & beans ,tortillas,2 lobsters,crab,shrimp, chicken,steak and my favorite 2 elote corns.It was well worth it no way 2 people can finish this. I say 3 people my wife says 4 whatever...We'll definitely do this place whenever we're in SD.but next time we'll try the(Big Baja bucket)$60 bucks...It's more our size for just 2 people.<//review>

<text>What a disappointment from last year. Way overpriced for what we got. We ordered the Sea of Cortez Bucket and got something that was way smaller. Server came back and remedied it, but it was just not a good experience.

<Text>What a huuuuuge restaurant!!   This place is great for loud fun parties.  The epic grande burrito is very tasty and very large.  I figured with a name like that it would be too big to finish but it was not.  I kinda wish it was.  The drinks were good and the ambiance is super fun.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Fun atmosphere. Good music and delicious shrimp and lobster tails. Everytime we stay in San Diego this place is our list for dinner. The weekends get busy but the music makes it worth it. I ordered 3 Moscow mules and didn't taste any alcohol..lol asked them to make them stronger but that's it. It was good.</text>

Food was good but was disappointed that we couldn't order anything from the happy hour menu posted out front. We had a party 7 and we all wanted some nacho' s but could not order any since we got a table. The waiter never explained that we had to  get up and get our own chips and salsa, we noticed that others were getting them for themselves. Also they do have a parking lot but everyone coming to the restaurant had to pay the valet parking fee even though we parked ourselves. We will not be going back to this location again.</Text>

The ceviche was okaay, my son’s quesadillas were okaay, and my husband liked his Taste of Baja Bucket. Our chips and guacamole that we ordered as a side came out with the meal so we barely ate it, but maybe that was also because it looked like it had been sitting out for a while, and had no taste. I’d never normally complain about iced tea, but it’s so hard to get it wrong and they did. Our service was friendly but we didn’t see much of her. Overall, totally mediocre, and especially for the price.<//review>

<Review>My husband and I loved the food, service, atmosphere and feel to this place. We had the original bucket with the 5 de mayo special which added crab, guacamole appetizer and fried ice cream. It was a lot of food we couldn't finish it. The lobster tails were small but juicy and meaty. The steak and chicken were grilled to perfection. The shrimp were huge and the food seasoning was great. This place is fun and also family friendly. We highly recommend for locals and visitors.<//Review></record>

<review>$125 mistake!  Visiting so won't be making this mistake again.  Maybe something else is good here but we didnt get.  The surf and turf tacos would be better if they used better tortillas.  The meat and shrimp inside taco was ok.  Lobster Roll and fries was not good.   Service was ok at best.</review>< Pics>

Just ate here and I think it will be hard to eat seafood elsewhere. Was very good, servers are friendly, fast service. Recomend this place for a great twist on seafood.</Review>

Easy parking for an area with very little parking and in my top 3 list of best salsas. I love salsa and chip and I have try many in so cal. This location has better a salsa bar then the mira mesa location, which is not in my top 3.</text>

< Review>
Very disappointing. Contrary to what other reviewers have posted, no chips and salsa were offered. Margaritas lacked flavor. Lobster Lovers' combo included a deep-fried lobster taco, which was quite good, but the few chunks of langosta in the small enchilada were overwhelmed by the cheese. To top it off, everything was overpriced. On the plus side, my server Nicole was very friendly and helpful. With so many great Mexican restaurants in San Diego this one is best avoided.<//Review>

The food is always great here but I was very disappointed that they charge you a valet fee just to park your car in their parking lot even if you're eating in their restaurant. We had a big party of 12. I know it's in Old Town but they charge the same fee for people to park there and they're not even eating in the restaurant, which I can understand that but not if you're eating there. That's why I gave them only 3 stars. We came during the week but weekend a few times and never paid a fee.< /Review>

Rockin Baja Lobby is pretty good. The lobster bites and buckets of seafood are tasty. Don't forget to take advantage of the chip bar.</text>

Had out of town guest, took them here for lunch. What a mistake. $5 involuntary  parking, requested patio seating, and they completely forgot about us. My wife had to leave and remind them of our presence even though we were 10 feet from the hostess station. The food was okay, nothing special. They attempted to make their earlier screw- up right by removing a meal from the bill (hence the 2nd star), but the damage was done.</review>

It's an okay generic tourist trap for Mexican food. I didn't expect much but the beers were big and they had the LA Kings on TV. The food was good but the beer was the high point. Not too busy but then again it was Interest season.< /Review>

If you're passing by definitely check this place out....so WORTH IT! they even have live music on saturday's (starts at 5-5:30 pm) they're open late. If you're going to walk around afterwards pay the 7$ for parking you won't regret it.........plus you take your time eating and enjoying your entertainment. The buckets are pretty huge!! The food and the staff were excellent! Will be coming back.< /Text>

The food had good flavor. The chicken was a bit salty for my taste. We ordered the bucket for two. The waitress that brought my beer to the table and spilled some on the table and on my arm. She did apologize as she walked away. Didn't even offer to help clean up. Another waiter brought us a bowl for the shells with wipes to clean up your hands. When we grabbed the wipes to clean up they were soaked in butter. Everything just seemed sloppy and rushed.</review>

<text>I really want to give a higher review! They have been pretty good to us in the past but of late, just don't live up to expectations. The food was just ok but we didn't receive a third of the correct items we ordered and there were hair(s) (not just one) in the food that we ordered. It took several staff members snd a manager to get us close to what we ordered (no hairs but not all of which we ordered) and there were incorrect prices on the final bill. We felt really bad for our server sand tried to make her night much better by not penalizing her for the shortcomings of the kitchen and management (we are industry peeps and 35% was the least we could do). This was our third not-so-fun trip here in the past few months. To make things worse, I got an email from Open Table saying that we "no showed" for our table through the app when we were actually 10 minutes early for our reservation. *sighs*<//text>< username>

Music is too loud to hear other people in the group. It wasn't very busy and service was okay. I had the crane asada taco, the meat was too dry for me.< /text>

Enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere each of the three times I've been there with guests from out of town.  Frankly, it's hard to find bad Mexican food in Old Towne.< /Text>

Everything inside the restaurant was good. It was the valet parking that this review is based on. They scratched my 2015 Honda accord and when i talked to the workers about it they had rude side conversation in front of me twice. They were joking or making fun of the situation-childish. I also called the number on their incidint report the next day 4/2/17 and s/w Tim he was defending his team as expected and just kept talking and talking and.......
Finally said he would review the cameras. I know how this whole things gonna turn out.<//Review>

This place was great! Had great service, food and the atmosphere was cool. We were in staying in Old Town for the week and decided to go there because it sounded allot like Joe's Crab Shack. It was hands down allot better.< /Review>

The "street tacos" are really good, but the seating and tables are not the cleanest (makes me wonder about the kitchen). Happy hour 12 ounce Margaritas for $5 is not the best deal in town. This place is not too authentic with atmosphere. More "country music" than latin, but overall... ok</text>

<text>Neverending fresh salsa and chips make this a notable place. There are over 6 options for salsa and you can mix your own style of nachos as you wait for your food. Seafood is incredibly fresh and tasty. Drinks are strongly recommended and there are many Happy Hour choices.</text>< Pictures>

Well I can't rate the food because I didn't get to eat .
Went in waited 5-10 mins..decided to go up and get a drink because nobody had even come by .
Waited another 5-10 mins, now we are becoming irate that not one single person has acknowledged our existence.

Told manager. He mentioned they are good and honest 90% of the time? Ok cool. he did offer to make it better but at that point I didn't want to be there...and probably won't ever go back .<//text>

I've been here 3 times I came 2 times after I was diagnosed with celiac disease they were very nice with providing me a gluten-free menu and also  kept the flour tortillas away from my food.  We LOVE it here</Review>

DELICIOUS FOOD...Nice environment live music, but parking not to good usually have to park about 2 or 3 blks away...
Overall a great restaurant, we were there celebrating my daughters b-day.

<Review>Been eating here for years, last visit was in January 2019 till today ,seems like quality control is slipping in the kitchen dept . Ordered the Baja Bucket as usual ,lobster tails were mushy like mash potatoes, chicken was over season and the corn was old and soggy , on top of all, waitress were slow to take our order and today was a slow night , manager did check with us and replaced the lobster tails with new ones . Also 4% surcharge will be added to your bill just because . "Hey Google" find me a new lobster restaurant , lol .< /Review>< GmapID>

This was our first experience at the old town location and it was not what I had expected . . we did valet and got a table  by the bar. 20-25 minuets passed and no one had even bothered to ask if we needed any beverages while we thought about our choices. I went in for a nice Sunday family lunch but It made me upset that the waitresses just walked pass us. Finally I got up and asked the bartender what do I have to do in order to get someone to take my order, the bartender apologized and he took our orders. Still none of the waitresses bothered to take over but that's fine because we know that the bartenders went out of their way when they are not even suppose to waitress. I didn't get their names but I do appreciate that and I give them 5 stars for what they did. My two stars I'm giving is not for the food but for the hospitality that me and my family received.</Text>

The food was awesome as always with one exception.....the rice!! Why!!! Instead of the usual red rice, they had this lime cilantro flavored rice. I didn't care for it. I hope you get enough complaints to bring back the red rice from before...or at least have plain white rice.<//Text>

The food and ambient is great. Loved their mango salsa. However you have to get it yourself at the salsa bar. Wished the salsa containers were a little bit bigger. The restaurant has $5 valet parking which I think is great that saves you from a headache looking for parking in the area deficient of parking space.</Review>

2 because the Mango Pineapple Salsa was to die for... Unfortunately that the only thing I ate... Arrived at 9 pm I had to prompt the young ladies out front to seat us, once seated no one approached our table to asked were we ready to order nor even take a beverage order... By 9:25 pm I watched a couple get seated and promptly served.... I politely left my table and left the establishement... Informed the hostess of the poor service and walked after I was told they were out of business cards..... Yes, once I got in my car I called and spoke to the manager..... It’s unfortunate cause I’ve never eaten at Rockin’ Baja Lobster and probably won’t go back......</Review>

If you cant make south of the border to Puerto Nuevo. This is your Spot. There's free 4 hour parking a block away. They do offer Valet. Lobster is perfectly cooked and spice on point.< /text>

The food was pretty good, atmosphere and setting amazing. But the drinks are made weak. We went there for margaritas and we're pretty disappointed. If you're goin for food, a lively atmosphere, and beautiful tropical decorations, then this is a good choice. But if you're going for strong, well made margaritas, then I'd suggest to look elsewhere.</review>

I love their Baja Bomber but, they don't keep the mix consistent. Sometimes the alcohol content is great and I feel like it's worth the money and other times not so much.  It's a great drink if it's made right.  Their food really isn't that great.  It's mediocre at best and I've tried 8-10 things off of their menu.  They have a great salsa bar for everyone who visits the restaurant and it's free which is great! They have an OK Happy Hour and that's about the only time I like coming here.  Nothing special for Taco Tuesday.  They are the Official Home of the SD Gulls Hockey Team.  I'm from the Great North and Hockeytown Detroit Michigan so I might be finding myself here more often due to that if they run extra specials.  I don't go out of my way here but, it's ok.  I love the history in this building.  It's a part of the original SD landscape and was called The Long House.  Supposedly haunted which makes it exciting.  Just wish I enjoyed their food more and found their drinks more consistent.< /Review>< UserId.>

My favorite Mexican restaurant.  They have an endless chip and salsa bar,  The service is good and the food does not disappoint.  There is a very small parking lot though so parking can be iffy at times.<//text>

<Review>Service with a smile and it was happy hour when I was there so drinks and starters were pretty cheap.
Also had the Gnarly Nachos and the Lobster Lovers Combo.
It felt the food was more Mexican than seafood but it's my fault for not researching it enough.</Review>< Date>

AMAZING FOOD!!! We were seated right away and the waiter was extremely patient being this was our first time coming. Juan V had amazing customer service and hospitality. And the food. LAWD JESUS!!! It was all amazing. Especially the Lobster. I'm from Louisiana and everyone "warned" me I would hate any food from California bc no one believes in using seasoning out here lol but to my surprise literally everything at this place tasted phenomenal. It gets a little busy (bc the food is so amazing) but its no reason to get impatient or leave a bad review. Great things come with time and sometimes you have to wait. Definitely coming back here on my next visit. No I wasn't paid to leave this review lol I'm a huge advocate of reviewing. ❤</Review>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>Been going to RBL for 15 years. Used to have coupon for Baja Bucket for 2 which made it affordable, food was excellent, atmosphere awesome. Last few years food as gone downhill, could barely separate lobster from shell, shrimp mushy, chicken & Carne Asada so nasty & grizzly my dog wouldn't eat it. Even the beans & rice were bad, corn was OK, nice they give that instead of the Caesar salad. The only enjoyable part of the meal was the entertainment. Service was good. What happened to the food?  I know with the amount of business they can afford better quality meat, poultry & seafood & better cooks.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Response>None< /Response><date>1530639365366<//date><text>The chips and salsa bar is fantastic! Free refills on both often as you want them, with some tasty salsas to choose from. The staff here are really friendly, and the food is delicious. The fish n chips were especially well-cooked. I got Rocky's Bowl, which is a generous combination of carne asada, grilled chicken, and jumbo shrimp. It is served over rice and beans and they give you free tortillas with all rice dishes. Only complaint is that they overcooked the carne asada and it was tough, but everything else was top-notch.< /text>< Pics>

Great service, all the food was awesome we had the bucket for two, lobster tails, carne asada, grilled chicken, shrimp, rice and beans. It was really busy and we only had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated. After we ordered the food was out in about 10 minutes. I highly recommend this place.< /review>

I don’t like giving one star reviews, and I also don’t like reading one star reviews because most people who give a one star review are super picky and kind of mean.

With that being said, I have to give this poor review because the experience that my girlfriend and I had yesterday was just not acceptable on any standard. Here is a list of issues that came forward yesterday evening.

1. We were told that we could find instant seating by the bar or wait 20 minutes to get nicer, more central seating. We chose to wait and we’re still seated next to the bar. When asked if they could fix their mistake the hostess said yess of course and would re-seat us in a couple of minutes...she never came back. Shortly afterwards a server named CJ, who was not our server told us that we were better off staying here and that we don’t need the other more central seating that we originally wanted. This was rude and unprofessional.

2. CJ (still not our server) then proceeded to take our order because our server was busy. We were completely okay with this and understood. We gave our order which was the CORTEZ BUCKET $38 and the FISH AND CHIPS BUCKET $18. We got our food pretty quickly which was really cool but it was the wrong food. They gave us the CORTEZ BUCKET FOR TWO which costs $76. Our original order was going to cost $56. We explained this to our new waitress who then went and got CJ who took our order. CJ said “omg please don’t hate me, I’m so sorry but this is okay right?”. My girlfriend stated again that the cost for this dish is more than our original order. The waitress offered to take it back and go get our original order. We didn’t want to send the food back because it would have been a lot of food that would have been thrown out and we are always nervous sending food back in fear that the staff will take their revenge out on our dish.

3. The recovery for this blunder was horrible. The waitress gave us a measly 5% off our bill and we ended up spending $84 food and tax. After tip it was 99$. Yes I still gave a 20% tip because the original issue was not our waitresses fault even though she didn’t help recover anything.

In conclusion we will not go here again. We will also not recomend them. We are here on vacation from Chicago and not even an chili’s or Applebee’s has treated us like this. Future customers beware.< /text>

<review>The food and service was AMAZING!!  The surf and turf bucket and carne asada fries are an absolute must!!  Everything is seasoned so well and the ambiance is casual and comfortable.

<review>Don't be confused by the high ratings. Stick to "safe" items they can't screw up, like seafood buckets or a quesadilla...this place's food can be awful. Poor quality for the pricey cost.< /review>< Pictures>

First time going here and the food and the atmosphere was awesome, live musician was great. Didn't know what to get so oredered appetizers and they were way bigger then expected and enough to fill up on! Lobster bites and carne asada fries were ridiculous.<//review>

I had the tres amigos tacos. I replaced the shrimp tacos for a seared ahi taco. The seared ahi taco was awesome!

The chip bar is great as well. Would have given 5 stars but our server sucked<//Text>

<text>Fun place and great food. The service was good but not great. Love the original bucket full of carne asada Pollo asada shrimp Lobster and all the rice and beans you can eat. Very tasty! Fun place to go for parties but not if you're looking for a quiet dinner it's very loud.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80deaade206267a3:0x3e05f6215d552d43< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>We were in town to visit family. Decided to eat at this restaurant. Food was good, but two of us ended up with food poisoning. We were the only two out of the group who had the salsa.been very sick for the last 24 hours. Chips and salsa one serves themselves. Either salsa or utensils that all public touch caused it. Will never go back< /review>< Pics>

< review>
Interesting indoor/outdoor environment. Floor is a little dirty but it is a very busy place. There's a nice water fountain and many tiki tourches. The food is ok. Good casual place for dinner and drinks. Service is fair, food is ok but the price is a little too high. The Bucket dishes are big looking because there is an upside down bowl at the bottom. I would not recommend this place.</review>

Service was great, food to me was not impressive, it was ok, but not impressed enough to ever go back unless there is no other option and I am starving... i was there on a quick weekend vacation and i was kinda disappointed for going there.<//Text>

Get a bucket, it's always the best options far as taste and cost. Only downfall is buckets are only for 2 people but the portioning doesn't seem lie enough to fill 2 hungry adults</Text>

Carne asada, pollo asada, lobster tails, shrimp and crab legs, spiced up and overflowing out of a bucket. 10 different kinds of salsas (mango is addictive) fresh tortillas, great loud atmosphere in the heart of Old Town. One of my favorite places to go to. Everything is so good you cant stop eating even though it hurts to eat more. I could go on and on and on but you need to just go here already.< /Review>

Came here and sat near the bar. Bad idea; we were forgotten for over 30mins before we could order a soda and water. Food was okay, but order came out wrong.< /text>

Well well well...
No, all the buzz and a lot of noise but no true flavors. Lobster roll? If anything, at a mid range perfection. I can here because some friends told me about it. Nah, such friend I have that they have no sense of flavor nor what a great atmosphere feels like!
Anyways, the service was okay too, and for that I won't complain since I know the shortage of labor.
Carnitas tacos are good though!
I gotta say however, they have some funny quotes out here !</Text>

(Translated by Google) It would be nice to have a Burket. Rice and cone chowder feel too much and the flavors are superficial. Only those Koreans who love deep anchovy broth will be prepared for their hearts.

Burket을 시키는게 좋을듯하다. 라이스와 콘차우더는 너무 느끼했고 맛들은 겉핥기식이다. 한국인에 한하여 깊은 멸치육수를 사랑하는 자들은 마음의 준비를 하자.< /Text>
