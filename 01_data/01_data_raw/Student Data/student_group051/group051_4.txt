<text>If I could give you 0 stars, I would. But I'll give you 1 star for answering the phone quick. I just got off the phone inquiring about specials, but the guy on phone was very unprofessional, practically hurrying me up on my questions. The key to getting more clients is your availability to give great customer service. If you don't like your job why be there? I suggest this store gets new employees.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>I had an awesome experience at this store. The customer service was really good. Long story short I came in 20 minutes before they closed and brought my phone I bought online through boost. I was helped by Byron the store owner who signed me up with my boost plan. He helped me switch at no cost, installed my screen protector that I brought from home for free, and was extremely knowledgeable and respectful. I would definitely recommend him due to his great customer service.<//Review><user_id>111011336877407957449</user_id>< rate>

Simply WOW, Byron went above and beyond for us just to make sure we were taken care of, it was a complicated situation but he really did everything and worked it all out. If I can give him more stars I would!<//text>

We went into the Norwalk store to get some info about new phone upgrades for our current plan and we were greeted by the Sales Clerk, Gabriel.  What a great guy! Very knowledgeable of all the phones and the different plans. He upgraded our family plan because he noticed it was older and outdated and didn't have some of the better benefits of the newer plans. Gabriel also helped us with transferring our contacts, apps, and important info from our old phones to the new ones. And while he was working with us, he still made an effort to help other customers who needed to pay their bills, all with a smile and a great attitude. We definitely recommend going to this Boost store for anyone looking for great service. And we'll be going back for any extras we may need.< /text>

<review>LOCATION: It looks like a dim lit tavern, super cool! Spacious long wooden tables, each table enough to fill a group of 10 - 15 of your friends. We came on a Thursday night around 7 PM, wasn't too packed.

SERVICE: Very nice service, from the gentlemen at the front of the restaurant, are helpful to the folks at the bar!

Would I come back? Totally, but not if there's a long line outside like their usually is.</review>< Pictures>

Great ambiance, room and overall service experience. Nice selection of wines - local and otherwise. Citrus salad was really outstanding. Short rib was tender - flavourful. Pasta with tomato, ricotta and lemon was underwhelming- sounded like an interesting combo but turned out not to be. Waiter offered a replacement or dessert / port. The women behind me also complained about her order of the same dish. Net net we would go back - all the elements of a great experience.

Saw this place courtesy of the Worth-It Youtube channel and I had to come to check it out since I was in the Los Angeles area.

First off, I wanted to start off with how you order at Wurstkuche. You order your food and pay then go sit down and wait for your food. I really enjoyed this aspect because the stress of worrying about paying your food after your meal is eliminated and instead you can focus on enjoying the delicious food.< /text>

Amazing food and ambiance. Had the Bolstein Steak and a dish simply called Chocolate for dessert. I'll never forget this dining experience. Just out of this world! Not to mention world class service.</Review>

<Text>For the prices, the food should have been much better. Flavor of my tomato sugo was lackluster; my wife's salmon was better but still not up to expectations. Service was impeccable though. For better views and food, I recommend Toma just a few blocks away.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Wow!  Very delicious!  The drinks and the Crispy Salad were some of the best we have ever had.  Service was excellent and the atmosphere was very cool.  Great place for a date night or a swanky night out with friends.  We were there with the whole family (including an 8 year old) and thought it was perfect for that as well.<//text>< pics>

<text>Very good. The ribeye was cooked perfectly. The scallops were very large but the menu mentioned pork belly, but it was only in small bites scattered on the plate (wish there was more). And for dessert we had the black swan seen in the picture (we went for a birthday so they added a little birthday chocolate)<//text>< Pictures>

Food was delicious ... made a meal out of the starters and community dishes. Sweet Potatoe soup and Kale salad we the best I've ever had. The chick pea fries delicious. The staff very friendly and helpful.  Bobby and the best waiter- right there when you needed him but not hovering. Very knowledgeable about the menu and guided us through our selections< /review>

This place was awesome we meant to stay at the hotel California but decided to stay somewhere else. The restaurant was closed by the time we got there but the drinks were great and the staff was very friendly. It looked a little suspect on the drink side but when my drink came it was quite delicious great cocktails.</Text>

<Review>The chef is very creative with his flavor profiles here. The Kennebec fries and oysters were fantastic starters. Both the Branzino and scallops were prepared perfectly, and packed with flavor and presentation was very nice. Our server was friendly but not pushy.

Wonderful meal, sitting outside on a coolish evening. The food was excellent from appetiser to dessert. Nice half bottle of wine. The waiter was attentive and very polite and courteous with a bit of fun thrown in.< /review>

I took my son here to, you know, expand his culinary horizons... the staff was the friendliest you'd ever hope to find, the dishes are phenomenal and the atmosphere is fun & energetic without being too loud. A very classy and fun restaurant. Stop reading and get the now!<//text>

This was our first visit to Blackbird. We were early at 6pm on a Tuesday and had the place virtually to ourselves. Kelly, our server, could not have been more personable and professional. He described each dish we inquired about as if he were the chef and creator himself. He gave us the right balance of attention and service that complimented the delicious and creative dishes. We recommend the chickpea fries for an app, the diver scallops as the entree, and the most unusual Milk & Cookies for dessert. Don't miss this great new addition to the Hotel Californian complex .<//Text>

The service was amazing, it was our anniversary dinner and they brought us some champagne and took care of our desserts. The wagu burger was delicious as well as the fish.</review>

<Text>Great feel to this place! Although it may be a bit out of place in lower State, Blackbird has more of an up-town vibe, which may explain why the T-shirt and baseball cap crowd was jamming Finney's across the street, but we walked in and were able to sit at an excellent table. The service was attentive and unobtrusive, the chickpea fries were a great tasting menu item, the wines by the glass were carefully curated and served in the perfect stemware, and the draft beers featured some of my favorite craft beers. This is your place if you could use a little break from "bro" joints.</Text></record>

<Review>Fancy place part of the Hotel Californian. Really a bit overpriced for cocktails but they are catering to tourists. I will say that the specialty cocktail I had from their menu was tasty. Did not try any food but I did notice some other dinners enjoying a meal that looked good. Plenty of waitstaff on hand almost to many.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I’ve never been treated so poorly in Santa Barbara. Attempted to get a drink on two separate occasions - the latter, was patronized by a maître d‘ and told we could not “hover” at the bar.

<Text>They do not have at least 2 cashiers on Friday. Especially when your handicapped and are standi g with a cane.  July 15....It was a hot day. No air conditioning for your customer. But you can feel the cold air coming from the teller window.  Long line again only one cashier.  I will be ending my business with this business. The only care about their money and not the customer!
One last comment...All the cashiers are nice and friendly. Excellent Customer Service especially while they are the only cashier being nice and courteous while working under pressure. I hope ACE appreciate their hard work. They deserve a raise and another person to help them WITH Friday and weekend long lines!!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

< Review>
Long wait time in store at el monte branch. Every month I have to wait 30 to 40 mins just to do my loan transaction. People constantly walking out because they only have 1 and sometimes 2 but they go on break with all the people standing in line waiting to give you our hard earned cash.  I'm giving you 1 more chance before I take my business somewhere else.  Online service is great but I like to  prefer to pay cash un person.< /Review>

<review>If only I could rate this place no stars, I had went in today to cash my fasfa check. The lady right away said she didn't want to. Without even looking at my check. She just asked where it was from. I've cashed my fasfa check there before. It's just that lady was to lazy to verify it. That was before waiting 30 minutes for a long line that only one 2 workers were there. It's just the lady was lazy. Bad experience and poor Management this place has.<//review><username>Jose Garcia< /username></record>

<Review>He went the extra mile and was extra thorough. Plus he answered our questions and gave extra details when asked.  We walked into the appointment anxious, walked out feeling like we knew what we were getting into during the purchase of a home. Great reporting software that makes reports available very quickly and in a web based and/or pdf based format. He earned our repeat business. You won't be disappointed.</Review><name>Ryan C</name><user_id>106449688707047520963</user_id>< gmapID>

If you need an inspection that is through and detailed hire them immediately. This inspection saved us from buying a home that was nice on the outside but a hazard under the hood. We will hire them again for our next home inspection.</text>

I am a first time home buyer and every step of the process has brought upon stress. But with Jason at Citrus Home Inspection, that went away for a moment. Jason was punctual and very professional in his appearance and mannerisms. The quality of his instruments is on par with the quality of his work, which is backed up by his knowledge of building construction. Jason took his time to go over the details of the inspection at the end and the report he sent us was top notch, with detailed descriptions of concerns and high resolution pictures to back up his findings. I will never suggest another home inspector. If you need a home inspector today, you have found him. Worth every penny. Thanks Jason!<//text>

<time>1578946887237< /time><rate>5</rate><Review>Jason helped us with a mold inspection when we prepared to bring a chemotherapy family member home from the hospital and wanted to eliminate any risks. We needed someone ASAP and Jason made himself available. He was very thorough, very professional, very congenial. In addition to observation, he made good use of scientific equipment in his inspection and shared his findings as he went along.
The follow up report was issued in a timely manner as he promised, and it was well organized and easy to read.

As is probably obvious by our comments above, we would not hesitate to recommend him to friends, family or for our future needs. Although we were focused on potential mold issues, he would be our #1 recommendation for any home inspection.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Jason provided more value than the typical inspector I have used in the past. First, he was on time and spent more time at the house than I expected. The value of the report was first rate, but more, he spent considerable time reviewing all issues with us before We departed. I had some follow up needs, and Jason was prompt and professional in providing assistance required for our lender. Jason’s knowledge, complete reporting, and professional demeanor were great. I would recommend him to anybody and will use him again.<//review>

Jason at Citrus Home Inspection LLC was an absolute pro. Did his work efficiently, making sure to stop and answer any questions I had as he did the work. He sent me a full report within 24 hours that accurately, and succinctly documented any issues with the home I was buying. Additionally, he gave me some good advice as far as contractors and other professionals that could help with the home issues. Excellent service, would highly recommend.<//Review>

Citrus Home Inspection went above and beyond inspecting a new property that my husband and I were purchasing. They were very thorough when inspecting and gave a detailed report on anything they found in and outside of the home. We were very impressed that they used a drone to photograph the roof of the home to allow us to see things we wouldn’t have been able to do so otherwise. They were professional, kind and  answered all of our questions we had. We would highly recommend their services to anyone!< /review>

Jason did an amazing detailed job during our home inspection.  The result of his work revealed some significant findings that others may have passed up and not taken notice of.  This allowed me to make a rational and economical decision to not move forward with the purchase of this particular home.  After putting pen to paper on Jason's finds and recommendations, my wife and I would have spent well north of $20,000 to bring the home up to a turn key standard.   As I noted above, Jason's price was higher than I expected, but surely well worth every penny.   Thank you Jason for saving us ton of money down the road.  Bob D.< /Review>

<text>My experience with Jason Agre at Citrus Home Inspection was beyond amazing. I hired Jason to inspect a home I am purchasing. This is the 5th home I've purchased in my lifetime, and I have never had a more comprehensive, exhaustive, and complete report. As well, I have never hired a friendlier, more communicative inspector. I rarely post reviews, but felt compelled due to the quality of work and service I received. Beyond top notch! I highly recommend.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

In the process of buying our first home and we were put in contact with Jason. He called us immediately, explained the process, and answered all questions I had in thorough detail. He kept in contact with me during the whole process and when I showed up near the end of the inspection he walked me through and showed me each room, all points of interest, and answered everything every step of the way. His report was professional and all incline he followed up to make sure I was taken care of and had everything I needed. I will continue to go directly through this company for any needs I have in this department and will refer any friends and family to this company. My family can't thank Jason enough for his timeliness, professionalism, and customer care.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><text>We are in the process of purchasing a home in Big Bear, CA. Citrus Home Inspection (Jason) completed the inspection and report. What a positive experience! Jason is professional, personable and very thorough.   Since we were on the property during the time of the inspection, he gave us a verbal "big picture" of what he found. We received the final report today, and it's beautifully prepared, with easy to understand narrative accompanied by great visuals. We know what needs to be addressed by the current owner, and what we can hack away at once we take ownership. We would never have predicted that the home inspection would be one of the most positive parts of purchasing the house!< /text>< Pics>

Jason was a total professional throughout the entire process.  He provided very thorough feedback and recorded any potential issues or code concerns.  His digital printout was very informative and was instrumental in closing my offer.  The format is even user friendly for agents as it allows for them to be included to pull directly from the report for repair request.  I would recommend Jason and Citrus Home Inspection to anyone out there.  Military friendly business with quality performance.< /Review>

As a realtor it is imperative that you use a home inspector that you can trust - Jason is just that. He is extremely knowledgeable.  He is a consummate professional, takes his time to explain to my buyers and sellers every detail. His reports are detailed and accessible, usually within 24 hours.

Jason did a very good job on our inspection. He was there before he said he would be and he left hours later. He even stayed extra hour to walk my client through some of the trouble parts of the home. It's nice knowing you can rely on someone to do the right thing. Plus they offer some other incentives that other companies don't offer. Great guy great company and was even less than some competitors.< /Review>

Jason Agre did a fabulous job for me. He went through the house examining every inch inside and out. It was almost discouraging how many issues he highlighted. But, as he correctly pointed out, that is what we ask him to do. His report was easy to follow as it was categorized from safety issues to minor cosmetic details. Each item was well explained and then he spent all the time I needed talking me through each of them, answering my questions, helping me prioritize issues, and even discussing repair cost estimates. The result was that after serious negotiation backed by Jason’s report the seller met all of my requests. I highly recommend Jason and would hire him again in a heartbeat.< /Text>

Jason Agre from Citrus Home Inspection completed the inspection on our home in the mountain town of Green Valley Lake. We were instructed to arrive an hour after the inspection started so it would be complete upon are arrival. Jason had completed the inspection when we arrived and gave us a thorough explanation of the issues and showed us all areas of concern. He was able to answer any and all questions we had reference the inspection. Our inspection report was competed before Jason left the property. Payment was quick and easy (and affordable), all done on line. I would definitely recommend Citrus Home Inspection if you are buying a house on the hill.<//review>

Jason was very friendly and very knowledgeable of his job and what he is doing. Jason took the time to sit down and explain in detail of the inspection he performed. He was informative and was open to any and all questions and suggestions. He answered all of me and my wife's questions without hesitation and even elaborated more than just giving a short answer. I highly recommend and refer Citrus Hone inspection any faybof the week.</review>< Response>

It was a pleasure meeting Jason.  He is professional, knowledgeable and has excellent interpersonal skills.  His work was thorough and he explained everything to us in detail.  He was sure to answer all of our questions and took all the time we needed.  His report was promptly sent to us the same day!  We would gladly recommend Jason to anyone!<//text>

I couldn’t have hoped for a better experience than I had with Jason Agre and Citrus Home Inspection. His fees were very reasonable, he adjusted his schedule around mine and he was very knowledgeable. Additionally, Jason’s use of current technology (drone and FLIR infrared camera) allowed him to find broken roof tiles and a leak stemming from the master bathroom. The house was previously on the market and had been inspected less than two weeks prior to Jason’s inspection and the leak was not found at that time. I wouldn’t hesitate to hire Jason again and I’ve already recommended him to a friend.< /Review>

He was professional, friendly, knowledgeable about the area and the specific details that pertained to the home, detailed and patient. He gave us a thorough personal walk-through and description of the issues he found, and then that evening we received his incredibly thorough and well organized report. The website he uses makes the process clear and simple for the buyer to understand, share, and request for repairs/credits from the seller.

I would use Citrus Home Inspection again and again!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Ordered over the phone and was quick and easy to find. Would recommend parking by the 7/11 for pick up due to parking.

Lots of tortillas for a take order the shrimp and sea food was great!< /Text>

<review>I was having my bus washed across the street from the restaurant. And since i actually have spent time in Altamirano, Mexico i went over and had some Pazole, and it was so good,  the salsa was excellent and the chips were perfectly thin and crisp.
I recommend it!!!< /review><GmapID>0x80e940796c59ec03:0xbd60b93e8c619a55</GmapID><user>111275097663921881335</user>< rate>

< Review>
Authentic family run Mexican food restaurant serving scatch-made classic entrees in a humble yet spacious dining room in the heart of Old Town Goleta. The Chile Verde was tender and delicious with a depth of flavor that left me pleasantly surprised. The beef alambre was beautifully composed and surprisingly savory with the addition of bacon to the usual ingredients. I can't wait to go back and try the homemade chicken mole.</Review>

Very good Chile Verde, very lean & tasty.  Huevos Ranchero just OK.
Their margaritas are made with wine. Lots of tv's, Kind of bright lights. Nice server. Parking somewhat difficult.< /text>

I got Taquitos that comprises of rice, beans, and chicken tortilla wraps. The rice and beans were good. But the chicken was tasteless and the wraps just contain plain chicken without any flavors or veggies.<//text>

This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. I love a sit down restaurant that serves chips and salsa and combo plates, and Altamiranos is a great option for this. I love their chile rellenos, and their chicken mole enchiladas are amazing! Plus the prices are super reasonable for what you get.</text>

My experience with Destiny was fabulous. I had a mix up occur with my original purchase which I wasn’t too pleased about so I called Destiny to see if the situation could be rectified. Essentially I was sold something that wasn’t what I specifically requested and once it was delivered, I realized that the height of the mattress was not correct. I was thinking of just dealing with it and being unhappy with my purchase but I remembered that Destiny helped out my sales associate check out on the register the day of the purchase. I called her and told her the whole story and she first apologized about the whole thing and made the arrangements to have our current mattress taken away and a new one with the correct height delivered to us. I am more than happy with her customer service and her ability to really listen and find a solution. Kudos to Destiny, she turned an unhappy customer around to a happy one. Just to note that the Sales Associate helping me out that day was new so I understand mistakes happen..</Review>

<Review>I was very impressed with the customer service. The young lady that helped me was Destiny Riparip. From the get go she was very sweet to my wife and I. Our 2 kids were running around the store and she was still very nice and welcoming. We didn’t really know what type of mattress we were looking for so she helped up by suggesting some medium mattresses and move from there. We ended up deciding on a medium beautyrest and she put in the extra work to get us an excellent deal on the mattress we wanted along with some perks. I was very impressed with her service and non-pushiness. Thank you Destiny for your reminding us that great customer service is not extinct!<//Review><user_name>Xavier Silva<//user_name><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><UserId.>109995771576218826806< /UserId.>< Rating>

I was greeted promptly by the staff. The are was compliant with social distance guidelines. I was asked specific questions that helped make the right choice. I was impressed in the level of effort the staff made to find me the best price in all the options available. I was able to upgrade to better quality mattress for a fair price. The staff were courteous and professional. I was in and out with no delay on my purchase. I was offered delivery within a reasonable time. Provided you are able to wait for your delivery I am sure you will get the product you are looking need. Best of all, and I am not being asked to say this, I was able to get financing for 2 years with no interest!</Text>

He made sure I got the right mattress for my needs, and made sure it would be delivered properly to our new home in AZ. The price was very fair. Shopping at Mattress Firm was a very pleasant experience, even with masks on.< /review>< pictures>

< Review>
I have shopped with Mattress Firm (at Steven's Creek) before and we decided to return here to upgrade a king size mattress. It was a little past 7 PM when we arrived. Destiny, the store manager was very helpful and patient with us and walked us through the different options we could pick from. She made us feel comfortable and relaxed and made the experience all the more better. We finally picked a Tempurpedic king which met our budget and comfort needs.

Even though it was a tad beyond closing time, she ensured made sure we were well informed and never pushed us towards any additional purchases.

Delivery:

The mattress was delivered to us in two days and the delivery personnel were extremely quick : Removing / transferring our older mattresses and installing the new one - all within 30 minutes. Social distancing and safety norms followed throughout.

I highly recommend this store for their excellent customer service.< /Review>

<Text>My experience with mattress firm on Blossom Hill in San Jose was great! I walked in and was helped immediately. I was shown about 5 different mattresses. Manny was very knowledgeable on all types of mattresses. The price was $100.00 less the another mattress store that I had just come from. I want to thank Manny for helping my eight-year-old grandson find the perfect mattress! Very good deal as well.

Thanks,

I recently went to Mattress Firm Blossom Hill Rd. and had an EXCELLENT experience! I came in with little to no knowledge of mattresses and Nick was able to assess my needs and provide me with several mattress options based off of price, availability, and my specific comfort needs. If you're looking for a new mattress, I HIGHLY recommend Mattress Firm Blossom Hill Rd!<//review>

We recently purchased a very expensive mattress, adjustable base, and pillows, and had a great customer service experience with Destiny. She was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and driven to achieve customer satisfaction. She is one of the main reasons why we will never shop anywhere else but Mattress Firm.

Thank you Destiny.< /review>

<Text>Thank you Jason from the Blossom Hill store for thinking out side the box on a solution for a present. The Purple cushion wasn’t available at his store. After we hung up he called me back with a few other solutions. Then looked up where others cushions were and validated with the store, created an invoice and I paid for the item. We drove to Mtn View store walked in and got the gift. Very easy process and saved us $$ and from going to the mall. Thank you Jason, great customer service!!!</Text>< GmapID>

<Review>My husband and I went into a Mattress firm just to browse since we will be moving soon and know it’s that time for a new mattress. We had the pleasure of talking to Destiny, she was very knowledgeable about every mattress we laid eyes on and that was all of them. We did purchase a mattress and can’t wait for the delivery!!<//Review>< Time>

We bought a king size mattress and a queen size mattress from Jason(Jashwin). He is a great salesman and is very knowledgable. We told him our requirements and he took care of all of them and answered all our questions. Would buy from him again and from this store.< /review>

Excellent service. I bought the mattress and base after having my questions answered by Destiny.

Pricing was comparable but the service was the reason why I went with Mattress Firm.

I am a repeat customer.< /review>

I didn’t think getting a mattress would be such a quick and easy process! Destiny and Jason were very helpful and offered great advice, but weren’t too pushy. I was worried about trying out mattresses during COVID, but it was very safe.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Was received by Jason (Jashwin Ram).
- World Class Service is the best way to describe our experience. Really don’t think it gets any better than our experience. Highly recommend everyone comes to see him.

Came with the Intention to buy 1 mattress. We left Mattress Firm with 2 mattress + adjustable base + covers.
- Already had 1 of 2 mattress set aside elsewhere(Mancinis), but cancelling after meeting Jason was a no brainer.

He’s welcoming, knowledgeable and patient.
- We learned a lot and we think we made some great choices with his help.
- Very happy he allowed us to try different choices of styles, brands, prices and give my family and I time to make the right decision during our experience.

I recommend this place of business because of Jason and we look forward to sending over referrals as we know they will leave as happy as we did.

Thank you, Jason.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Called for a couple products I was interested in. The nice man on the phone found a location where they were in stock. Sent me an email with the invoice. I paid online and then drove to the location to pick up. Had to sign a document and walked out with two Purple cushions. Easy enough.< /text>

<text>I’m someone who was affected by the CZU lightning complex fires in Santa Cruz county. Thankfully my house was spared but it has been a LONG road to be able to get home due to having smoke damage. I went in to mattress firm almost 2 months ago to get a quote for my insurance company and Nicholas Bedel went above and beyond in helping me out. He was able to help me find an equivalent replacement since my current mattress was no longer being made and was even able to get me the sale price for my daughters bed that I had just bought 6 months prior to the fires. It was quite the process getting the ins money but when I did, Nicholas still remembered me almost 2 months later. I’m sure it help that in the first trip we discovered our daughters had the exact same first and middle name. I am so thankful to him and mattress firm for getting me once step closer to getting my home back to normal and finally getting to go home.</text>< Pictures>

<review>My husband and I have been sleeping in a full sized tempur pedic mattress we inherited that's over 20 years old. We love it it's just too small for us. We walked in today knowing we wanted tempur pedic but weren't 100% sure what we would be needing to spend with the upgrade to a king, sheets, bed frame etc. Jason was immediately helpful and kind and really took the time to listen to our needs. He asked questions and really made sure we got the best deal that fit our needs. Jason was so knowledgeable and personal. My husband and I are huge on customer service and can instantly tell if we want to work with someone or not. People shop with people. It's not about the product. So grateful to have walked in and been treated so well with such a big purchase. Thanks Jason. We really enjoyed working with you and are so excited to get our new bed in a week.</review>< pics>

Great experience. Shane was great as my wife and I jumped on every single bed to find the perfect mattress. He spent all the time we needed and answered every question we had. You guys have to look him up to help you out.</Text>

<Review>This place is THE BEST without a doubt. My boyfriend and I bought 2 mattresses here, at truly unbeatable prices.

I will forever feel grateful to the salesperson who assisted me. She possessed a unique blend of abilities and personality. She genuinely seemed to want to assist me even though I told her I probably wouldn't buy anything today. She asked me many questions; side, back, front sleeper etc. so she could help guide my decision. In fact, I was buying the bed for my 6'1" son who was away at college as his childhood bed was too small. She was personable, yet receptive which made me feel comfortable discussing my personal situation. She had excellent product knowledge. In the course of our discussion, I revealed how my son had a congenital heart defect and has had 5 open heart surgeries. She then wondered if a frame with the ability to recline/incline the head and feet would help him rehabilitate after his surgeries.  I had always thought these kinds of beds cost $5,000 and therefore out of the question. I was shocked at the low price. My son suffered greatly after every one of his open heart surgeries when he came home from the hospital to his flat bed. I was very sad that I never knew how affordable these reclining frames were. I do not discuss my personal business with strangers but this lady was different and I will forever feel the most profound sense of gratitude for the rest of my life.  She has helped me and my son more than she will ever know.  Jovannah, you are the best! Thank you!< /Text>

I bought a mattress 2 days ago at the Blossom Hill store near highway 85. After visiting the store 2 weeks prior, the sales person remembered me my wife, and the details of our visit. Excellent knowledge, efficient and quick service, and personable! Need I say more? Go there.< /review>

Came in not really planning to get a bed.  But with current back issues and helpful employees, they really look out for you and what's is best for you.  David was the person who helped me at this location.< /Review>

We booked a lesson with 4 kids, including 2 6-year-olds, and our instructors had every single one of us standing on our boards and riding waves by the end. Amazing. It was our first ever surf lesson but my kids keep asking to go again, they had so much fun. Really wonderful!< /Text>

So so so happy with this surf school!! We got a same day appointment after another company no showed us. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise because this place is the real deal. They are SO friendly and professional. My son absolutely loved Rod and his enthusiastic energy. He was absolutely determined to help the students learn the skills and be successful on the water. My 11 year old son was surfing by the 40 minute mark. He was even offering to come in on his day off to give another lesson before we flew home. Great people run this place! I won’t ever go anywhere else!</Text>

Excellent choice.  Our experience was everything we hoped it would be and more.  A fun filled exciting time in the waves off Pismo Beach.  Rod Way is a professional in every way. A shop owner, a skilled surfer and a experienced instructor. He was painfully patient with my 12 year old grandson.  Always enthusiastic with his never ending encouragement.  Even threw in some tricky maneuvers for an added treat and good entertainment.  He made a second trip back to his shop for a bigger board for my less than graceful grandson.  The pictures he provides are an added bonus. His perspective from off shore ocean level is like re-living the entire experience.  I could not be more pleased.<//text>

<Review>A perfect morning! It was a great experience the whole way through. Easy to book and find and just a quick walk to the water. Great instruction that was both fun and easy to implement. I was up and surfing in no time, and I definitely now feel equipped to grab a board and get out there on my own to practice!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< time>

Our family had an awesome time surfing with Rodney. He exceeded our expectations! My husband and I built on our skills, and our kids were getting rides quickly. He started with important foundations that we will carry with us and helped our kids build confidence in themselves. We all had so much fun! We are looking forward to scheduling more lessons in future visits. Don’t miss out on your opportunity to learn and grow as a surfer with Pismo Beach Surf Academy!< /review>

We love PBSA. My daughter did one group lesson awhile back and just recently came back for a private.  They are truly the kindest people and really do what they can to make sure you succeed!  Was impressed that during Covid, they followed all the guidelines, masks, staying 6’ apart, etc and still was able to give my daughter the best experience !  We tell everyone how awesome they are and now, more than ever go support this awesome family!!  They are taking private appointments now and I promise you won’t be disappointed!  Call and schedule yours and support this awesome small business 🏄‍♀️🏄‍♀️< /text>

Honestly it was an honour even to meet the great people that live and work out of this shop...because to these people it's not just a job. You can feel the passion as soon as you enter, They truly live their jobs. They were so attentive and caring, in a manner that they truly want to see you succeed. Kelly was so welcoming and friendly that you would almost would want to hang out all day there,if there weren't waves to ride. The tips and training that Rodney gave me will likely stay with me as I progress in my new passion. It also helped me get up on some waves, on my first day out there. It is because of their dedication to the sport, culture, lifestyle and to the people who come through their shop, that keep this such a great place to learn to surf!<//text>

< Review>
Never had I been so obliged to write a review. Flying in from Dubai managed to do some surfing on the side of a business trip. The whole experience was just beyond words. Rod and his lovely wife set me up for a great surfing session. Rod is phenomenal with experience that goes 50 years this guy is a legend, partaking in WSA competitions most of his life, he really knows his stuff, taught me what it takes to be a better surfer. His enthusiasm his great surfer vibe just made it all so much better. To top that Rod will take photos and videos of you having the time of your life for free! Check mine out. Highly recommended it couldn't get better.<//Review>

My 10 year old daughter said, "Rod was really nice and easy to understand" and my 13 year old daughter added, "I really liked Rod. He was fun and made learning fun!" As a Father that used to surf, but no longer can, I appreciated how Rod was able to be gentle and at the same time had a firmness when it came to safety. You can tell right away that he cares about safety, fun and learning to surf.

Rod and Izzy were great! My sister and I went out for her first lesson, and I had only be . Once before a year ago so I took a lesson again, and good thing I did! Rodney described everything in an easy to understand way and was super encouraging! And Izzy took pics of us out on the water! Definitely would recommend that you go to them. Prices were great as well and everything was included! Definitely affordable and great service</Review>

Rodney and Kelly are outstanding! Rodney provides the best surfing instruction while making his students feel welcomed and at home. Rodney also makes sure he takes great pictures of students for lasting memories! My son has improved significantly with every session and looks forward to return visits. If you are wondering where to go this is the place for you.

Thank you Rodney and Kelly for being awesome!<//Review>

We had an absolutely amazing experience with our surf lesson with Rodney today! Surfing has always been one of our dreams, and I couldn't have imagined a better experience. Rodney and his wife who own the shop were exceptional. They were extremely friendly and got us ready with wetsuits and made sure we had everything we could possibly need. Rodney's knowledge and excitement about surfing only added to our experience that I am certain we wouldn't have received elsewhere. He took over two hundred photos of our experience so we could gloat about the times we stood up, laugh at the times we crashed into the waves and always remember the amazingly fun time we had. He took us down to the beach and taught us about the board and proper positioning to catch some waves! He guided us along the way, but also let us try it out to make some mistakes and get a feel for the board. The best part is we were actually able to catch some waves! We will definitely be back in the near future!<//Review>

Best surfing tuition ever. So friendly and welcoming and such good value.  Rod and family were so good with Alex my son and had him up and surfing in no time. He really enjoyed it... so much that we returned the following day for a follow up. BIG BIG THANKS!!!!!!!! Highly recommend.<//Review>

<text>Blown away by the all-around experience with this surf school.  They valued our business from the second we climbed the stairs. Accommodating time slots..good advice on when to surf..encouraged me to shop around (that's confidence) but I knew Rod was 'good people' the minute he started talking about his  passion..the class got included in the life of a surfer from one who knows & It was awesome!  I got a second hand education as my daughter did not stop sharing stories of the experience! :) Skip buying the souvenir and get an adventure ... that's my advice! (BTW: Rod followed up with some truly spectacular photos that were the icing on the cake!)  I would do business with this group again in a SECOND!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><date>1523546520273<//date><response>None</response></record>

<review>Awesome experience! Better then we imagined! Been there in September. Rodney is so friendly and helpful. After getting some lessons we got all the freedom to explore the sea ourselves. We love the pictures made and the first-surf-experience he created for us. He's loving his work and his enthousasm is contagious. We're hooked and if we´re getting back in the area we´ll make sure to drop by this place again. Great job!< /review>< Gmap_id>

Okay, firstly, I NEVER do reviews. But it was a great experience. First surf lesson ever. Taj was my private  instructor and Rod(the owner) was out there with another group as well. Great guys. Very positive and helpful. After 10 minutes of instruction on the sand Taj thought I had a good enuff understanding and we went right out to the water and as I got more confidence we went out a little further and Taj was always positive and giving helpful hints. I caught a few waves and Rod was always right there with his GoPro to catch me while I was up. Price was less than the other shops n yet I  feel like I got more than I paid for. Rod will even be emailing pics to me for no extra charge.  I heartily suggest using them if your looking for lessons.< /text>

< review>
I happened to be in SLO for a week-long work trip in late April.  For some reason I had this crazy notion that if I woke up at 5:15am, I could surf in the mornings before heading in to the office at 9.  But where to find a deal on renting a board for an entire week?  The number of surf shops made it an almost overwhelming task.  PBSA came highly recommended by the bartender at Cool Cat Cafe, just down the street.

I stopped by, and explained my crazy idea to Rodney.  He was totally into it.  I didn't think I needed a lesson --which is dumb, you should totally get a lesson if you've never surfed before-- but Rodney hooked me up with a board and some basic advice, and I ran down to the beach,  stoked up like an 8 year old on Christmas morning.

The surfing at Pismo was absolutely fantastic.  On one particularly epic morning I counted 23 other surfers out there with me at 7:30am.  Watching the experienced folks catch waves was super cool.  But even Pismo has bad days, occasionally.  Towards the end of my week-long trip there was a day with a strong southerly current and huge wind-swell.  I fought the surf for a few minutes, but the Ocean was definitely winning.

On the way out, I happened to say hi to one of the locals in the parking lot.  He mentioned that Avila might be better.  After a 15 minute drive north, I discovered a perfectly groomed shore-break firing some very well mannered 3-foot pipes.  Day saved.

Bottom line, bring your crazy self to Pismo Beach Surf Academy.  They've got you covered.<//review>

<Name>Joyce Kuo</Name><Time>1469585520486< /Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>With a few weeks experience last year, my daughter Allyson has long been looking for a chance to surf again this summer. We flew all the way across Pacific Ocean from Taiwan (台灣) and decided to spend a few days on Pismo Beach for vacation.

While we were looking for a brief surfing class on the beach, we encountered coach Rodney and photographer Izzy by chance when they were teaching other students on Pismo.

Upon observing their professional approach with patience, further understanding their reasonable pricing, we immediately decided to enroll Rodney's class in the same afternoon.

That was the best decision we had made that day! Rodney and his daughter Izzy were full of hospitality and treated our family, a group of foreign visitors, like years of old friends.

Coach Rodney refreshed Allyson's memory of surfing from basic skills, followed up by a few rounds of leading practices, and constantly encourged her and built up her confidence. After 30 minutes, Allyson was able to fully managed her long board and re-enjoyed surfing again on the beautiful Pismo Beach.

Thank you Rodney and Izzy, you both really made our day completed! It is truly the best birthday present for Allyson! Pismo Beach Surf Academy is your best choice for surfing and highly recommended (強力推薦)!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Amazing place. Fantastic instructors. Really patient and fun. Defo the best place to start learning. Couldnt recomend it more. The great price included wetsuits, surfboards, and a guarantee to stand up on a wave. They even let you keep the board and suit for the rest of the day if you got the hang of it. Check them out, you wont regret it.<//review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Was the 3rd time in my life surfing. Rodney explained it so well that I could get up from the board right away. It was so much fun and he was super motivated! He gave me a lot of tips. I rented a surfboard the next day because it was so much fun, not only cheap, but also a very good board. Thanks to the previous surfing lesson, I was able to stand alone on the board a dozen times and steer it a bit.
Even my husband, who is no water rat otherwise was very enthusiastic. As the first surfing lesson in his life, Rodney was the best choice and aroused the surflus in his life. I can really warmly recommend it to everyone !!

(Original)
War das 3. mal in meinem Leben surfen. Rodney hat mir das so gut erklärt dass ich direkt vom Board aufstehen konnte.  Es hat so viel Spaß gemacht und er hat einen super motiviert! Er hat mir sehr viele Tips gegeben. Hab mir am nächsten Tag nochmal ein Surfboard ausgeliehen weil es so viel Spaß gemacht hat, war nicht nur günstig, sondern auch ein sehr gutes Board. Konnte dank der vorigen Surf Stunde auch alleine ein Dutzend mal auf dem Board stehen und es sogar etwas lenken.
Selbst mein Mann, der sonst keine Wasserratte ist war sehr begeistert. Als erste Surfstunde in seinem Leben war Rodney die beste Wahl und hat dabei die Surflust bei ihm geweckt. Ich kann es wirklich nur jedem wärmstens ans Herz legen!!< /review>

Wow amazing! The wait time wasn't long at all. They ask you while your waiting what you will be ordering then once they seat you, your food is ready with in minutes! I order galbi jjim, medium size and got it mild which mind you was spicy but so delicious! It fed three of us and trust us we were full. Might seem busy when you get there but trust me it's not.</Review>

<review>Very good price and amazing portion! Tea is served hot or cold. Kimchi and tea can be refilled. Casual environment, quick service, generous portions and delicious food.

<Review>The food is phenomenal, but the service is unbelievably slow.  I ordered an avocado roll mid dinner and it took 20 minutes to come out.  All it has is rice and avocado.  It's ridiculous.<//Review>< Pictures>

This place is a REVELATION. My favorite tofu restaurant ever! Way better than trendy ones with an hour wait nearby. High quality, incredibly flavorful, tons of excellent little sides, reasonable prices, always fast and friendly service. The decor is simple but cute. They do a lot of take out, but I love to eat there. Did I mention their tofu is homemade and organic?! And be sure to get the purple rice.<//text>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>New spot for sundubu! They have a good assortment of banchan. The kimchi is pretty weak. On the other hand, their potatoes are incredible. I've never had them with the kick of spiciness at the end before. There's also a beef/bamboo one that I wouldn't normally have tried, but was quite nice. Surprised they had pancakes too!

As far as the sundubu goes, I was pretty pleased with my experience here. I got the medium pork sundubu and thought the spice level was just right. I have to say I'm not a huge fan of the black organic soybean tofu, but it's definitely worth a try.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c778986be973:0x3d909a2a64d66e7f< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We went on a Saturday afternoon around 2 pm. Just one customer besides us. It has been almost 2 years since our last visit but we used to come a lot when we lived in this area. When I looked at the menu I was surprised to find the price has skyrocketed by 40% to 50%. But we didn’t realize it’s totally a different restaurant until we stepped out seeing the “Grand Opening” sign. 😂

We ordered Sliced Rib Eye and BBQ Pork came with tofu soup. All tastes good. Love the antipasto. Nevertheless the same price on Combo (with tofu soup) and a single entree doesn’t make sense. I wanted to get a Bibimbap without tofu soup but $15.99 didn’t sound right to me. More reasonable price for non-tofusoup fan would be nice.<//Review>< pics>

So much better than BCD!! Soondubu is super fresh with their homemade tofu and consistently like BCD (so hit and miss).
Staff has been super pleasant (my fiancé and I always sit in the same seats for our date nights)<//text>

This is kind of unusual place.  It used to be Mexican restaurant quite some time ago and change to korean restaurant.  I used to enjoy their 설렁탕 which is beef broth soup and their nang my son which is their cold noodle.  Now they change and specializes in tofu stew which was pretty decent.  I will have to go back to decide but was pretty good.<//text>

New owner was super friendly and made us feel welcome the moment we walked in!!! Pointed us in the right direction for the games we were looking for, even if that meant going to his competition stores. Prices were SUPER reasonable!! I wish we lived closer, as we would be regulars!!<//review>

Great little Shop and dealt with the Owner Lawrence. He and his staff are very customer focused and very welcoming. Everyone is important that I observed. Best most of all. Honesty. If you have vintage video games and systems go see them. I will be back to continue business with VGG.< /Text>

You can sell your video game electronics and consuls here for a very good price. Better than GameStop. The owner is very friendly and welcoming.<//Review>

I love this place. They have everything you would want or need. The inventory changes so you never know what you're going to find. By far my favorite retro video game store. The owner is super helpful and having a dog there a few times when I went in was just an added bonus!</review>

<Text>I haven't made it down the the store yet, but I did call in with some questions. They worker (assuming the owner) was super helpful and isn't a scam artist like a lot of the other hole in the wall video game places are. Go down there and check it out!

EDIT: Went down there and they were super cool and helpful! Not on the pricey side and was able to get a classic system with no hassle.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Great store! One thing though, maybe not use super sticky, damn near glued on, stickers for your used games. I know I'd be happier.</text>

I loved this place, it’s now my favorite video game store. Now, As for the people that think that this place is overpriced and that GameStop is cheaper, it’s actually not. This store sells an N64 for example, at 70.00$ while it is a little pricey, it’s actually a way better deal than GameStop which retails it at 90.00 dollars meaning you’d save 20 dollars!<//text>

<Text>Definitely a spot to check out. All of the games are well organized, and they have a really good selection. The staff is always great, they help me to pick out games I never heard of that I now love, and when I bought my N64 a few years ago the guy hooked it up with 2 free games and not the cheap kind either. Please support this awesome shop!<//Text>< Pictures>

They have lots of games from old to new . New games are most of the time cheaper then big stores and even game stop. The people who own the shop also run it and they have been gamers since childhood themselves. the can order and pre-order just like other places but at lower prices. They also clean and repair (as best they can ) game discs. They also buy your stuff if wanna sell.< /review>

They have a large selection of games for game consoles at fair prices. No PC games.
My main gripe was when we entered the man said hello, but after 15 to 20 minutes, he had not made an effort to ask us if we needed help. My friend picked a game and he didn't even bother to ask us if we were ready to go. I made eye contact with the man, and he lowered his eyes. I had to initiate conversation with this man to get my questions answered, instead of him using his customer service to help a paying customer.

Also there was no music which was mildly umcomfortable.

Updating my review because they gave my friend the wrong disk for the game he purchased, when he went back they gave him another game to go with it as an apology. That was awesome of them.< /Review>

<Review>I hate buying used games online, because I always end up getting something I wasn't expecting (rental stickers, permanent marker on the cartridge). This place has a great selection with a knowledgable staff. Prices are a little more than online, but you will know what you're  getting and you get to work with a great staff.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_name>

<Text>Having been to other used game stores and big bog stores for my gaming needs, I continued my search... Then I ran into Video Game Geeks..
A small, independent gaming store in the heart of Anaheim. I'm glad I found these guys because the place is clean, the staff is knowledgeable (and doesn't consist of neck beard nerds that will only argue or scoff at your purchases).

New games tend to be cheaper than chain stores and used/retro games come at a fair margin less than other stores around the neighborhood. My fave store...
Highly Recommended!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dd29b031f0f5ab:0xb3c7ed13a4feff91< /gmap_id></record>

Staff is very friendly and knowledgable. They have a great selection of retro games and are everything in the store is competitively priced. My son loves this store and we drive from the Yorba Linda area just to go there. Best place to go for retro items and assistance with anything game related.</review>

<Review>Bought a ps3 from these guys, i was told by one of the employees if it gives me any problems within 30 days bring it back and they will fix it. It gave me issues within a couple of weeks. It was scratching my games. I took it to them so they can fix it. Well i went to get it back 2 weeks later. Telling me i have to send it to Sony and refuse to do anything with it. When i got home the console was not put back together correctly, with broken tabs and a bunch of missing screws. What kind of crap is that. To top it off i called Sony about getting it repaired and they want $150 to fix it.< /Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< Time>

Such rude phone service. The person who picked up was very assuming of the idea that I didn’t know what I was talking about with a very condescending, snarky tone. By the end of his ego trip, it turned out I did know what I was talking about. Total jerk, never ended up buying the product.<//Review>

Best place to go to if you are looking for retro consoles, games, and various hardware, from the Magnavox Odyssey 2, Atari 2600, and NES to the Xbox One, PS4, and Wii U.< /review>

This is the store that was featured on "storage wars" and they estimated an nintedo collection that included a pal version of  stadium events at 3000...it's crap like this that floods the market with bad resellers..so if they are willing to give a bad price on tv imagine what they will do to you in real life.....just stay away.</Text>

Great prices and safe location. The owners keep everything clean. I see them out front cleaning the area in front of the store when I go by. They remember your name and take the time to greet you any time you go in.<//Review>

<review>Great selection of beer, wine and liquor. Owner (Raj) is a nice guy. Gives you a best deal on cigars like 2 for $1. He keep it real.
Also nice selection of premium liquor bottles and collector's editions. Prices vary from cheap to very expensive.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80900c4cc330f975:0x8c683a2add0378b</GmapID></record>

They are so disrespectful in this store towards none regular costomers and towards costomers with service dogs they yell at there costomrs.
I went to pay the man when he servred me at the same time he asked me what i wanted. Then when it was more then what i handed him a dollor 30 more i said yes sir i got you he raised his voice and said more i said ya i got you he then carried on to make it a disrespectful towards me to were i had to raise my voice to me me from losing face but when i did he refused to serve me after i produced the money he requested. And then i had to go out and record what i asked him.. So today im posting what took place after i took time to calm down. And come to an understanding to be sure i am correct on what im posting on this establishments reputation.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Bathroom was very clean. Yes I've been to other restaurants where even when the covid started restrooms were filty.. nice job. The service was excellent.  The food was delicious.  I don't know about the past reviews, in particular the cashier told me 30 mins for the order and it was about 28 29 minutes. I was pleased and very grateful the way I was handed the food. Sum other restaurants at times will throw the food and slam it on counter or table.  I will visit one more time. Later on the month.  For now its 5 stars. Alll the way.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLu1-NrvCqsksca08N05Edhwa6cgtd472ghp4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqsnx9ZsMIi7ZbxBi9CXJR3UoW3Aau5kYAxnQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTw6dd2ofG_VO_-mh-MruKmuQOlwoQFpmcDbU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyBBz7ms-MHmwwKlNoiJBEV-QszAzqQrBqAgU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIu_TkhEsNCPBpoCh5uPy-utX03KXhFpPsfNI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUdS14ldeqS1QNK0rPiVlj4tjx-N_pRxjE09U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVoS8QZrsoxu4y4WtbqirpJLDZv-uRr6_oww8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBYTOJEoiUZFx61aCY3rWwBzVt_Wpz3PM4t2M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNckQvYVJS1FnYbMpD6bwtKrVZCrgfrn5pmet4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdF3jd16kr2kYyDKzCNXJ9-dQ0u-XlqDZMVy8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_db0aDFJUH4milzVi7O677UQcKkdKqGgJVzE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYo5v4BOIrG2rQFNl_9XgilkQp8OOrkuhERNk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOlcnkCkNYtfASLkDUkEN5cH-EhtNdBhXKfyA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80c2b5881eea7d95:0x9396d759ebab7c35< /gmapID></record>

The coffee is so watery you can't even taste it. The sopa de Pata tastes of luke warm murky, watery red cilantro "soup". The only good thing are the pupusas, everything else is terrible.
This includes the staff, they sit you down then disappear for 20 minutes, appear again to take your order, place it one the table and we didn't see them again.
The worst place we've ever been too, the music is SO LOUD, I couldn't hear the person sitting next to me. Very disappointed with how this place turned out. We're never coming back here< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Not sure if is  the fact that the staff/cook don't feel as rushed as when restaurant is full and hectic. This past two times I have bought food there food tasted sooo good I really hope the restaurant keeps doing what is doing. I also see a B grade so keep up the good work.</review><Response>None< /Response><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_name>

Despite the numerous comments on the “poor customer service,” we had an exceptional experience here! The service was outstanding on top of their delicious food! Our server was personable, friendly, and she kindly answered our questions and gave recommendations. She offered free samples of their house-made drinks, and we had much fun trying them and ordering the drink that we knew what to expect. It was better than what we expected! En Salada! I repeat, it’s made in-house! and I suppose it requires a lot of work cause it had different types of fruits blended and chopped. It’s only $3.5 for the huge cup (“regular” size technically).

The pupusas were so homemade taste and fresh and huge!! They tasted far better than what I had at different places. It was less greasy and had more natural, harmonious flavors. Their tomato sauce and spicy sauce were so good as well.

The creamy chicken was good, but too rich for our taste. But overall, the presentation was quiet good and portion and flavor all exceeded our expectations.

I can’t say much to the authenticity as I don’t have the cultural experiences to base my opinion, but based on my personal experience stated above, I recommend this place!!< /Review>

< review>
Very affordable Salvadorean food with authentic flavors. Nice set up with plenty of spacious tables and the ambiance is really great because the interior is well lit, clean and organized. However my pupusas were pretty greasy. Also i specifically asked for 2 of them to be made with rice instead of the traditional corn masa but alas I got corn even though I paid more. The arrayan and ensalada drinks we had were not bad at all. Definitely worth a second visit i believe...< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Today 03/26/20 was my first time trying this spot i only go to 2 locations LA and the OC, i decided to try This spot out which is Gardena because i didn’t feel like driving to the OC today for pupusas I’m EXTREMELY picky with my pupusas so that means i don’t like going to any salvi spot or to every salvi spot. once i find my fav salvi spot it becomes my fav then I’m your loyal customer.

i ordered 6 Pupusas all mix, they we’re all FRESH, HUGE and EXTREMELY delicious the best pupusas I’ve had It was PERFECTO!!!! It  was not greasy and the tomato juice and salsa was perfect it was fresh as well, I also like how they tied the bags wit the tomato sauce and salsa in the bags they didn’t tie a real tight knot like most salvi spots I hate that it was very easy to open : )

Last things I ordered was ARROZ
& FRIOL both were medium size
They were so fresh!
I got sooo full after eating only 2 and I usually can eat 3-4 hahah that’s how full feeling they are. This food has a home made taste to it!!! very tasteful!!!!!! I love it !!!! The service was good!!! Very friendly girls I also ordered to go the wait wasn’t bad it only took 25-30 min to wait. It was very clean which I love ! The bread was very fresh to and drinks. i will be back !!!!! And pupusas was $2.50 each for 6 not bad at all for because I usually pay $40 at the other spots I go to for 6 pupusas . Beans $2.50 , rice $5.50 THANK U!!!🙏<//review>< Pics>

Some chips & frejoles or dip would nice before we get to order but The food is good & expensive. But the service is intimidating when it comes to paying, they input their own tip in your bill if you're dumb enough not to look & expect you to leave a tip at the table.</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I love salvadorian food. I was told about this place so we decided to visit and check ot out.
The food was ok not the best for the really inflated prices on the menu.
I really expected more for my money.
Service was ok. You would think the staff would be more friendly and customer focus, with all the money been charged for the mediocre food.
I mean they sure like to have theyre uniforms as if they are working at a hair salon or something but 90% of the staff lack of friendly customer service, most of the girls walk around with long straight faces makes you feel a bit intimidated to ask for assistance. And when you do decide to ask for extra napkins they look at you and keep on walking.
Very unprofessional if you ask me as you dont know if they heard you.

I honestly believe the uniforms the staff is allowed to wear encourage them to feel a bit superior then the customers expending theyre heard earned money to pay for theyre salaries. Ironic right! But is true this is the way they walk around the restaurant the arrogance is displayed. In almost every aspect and by they're body language
This is not a place where you see any kind of humbleness or graciousness been practiced by the staff

My last thought, Not worth the trip or the long wait. Not a place I would recommend it all!
There you have it, do you're self a favor and save your self the unpleasant and disappointing experience.< /Text>< Pictures>

Food was great but our server was very rude and I had to ask her several times for the same condiment multiple times! She would slam things with an attitude on our table! We were only a party of 2 and we were very polite to her. She was about 6 months pregnant and maybe she was frustrated but that is no reason for her to be so rude! If she needs a break from work maybe she needs and early leave...< /Text>

The food is good. The service is terrible. We always go there as a group and every single time we go an item isn't delivered to us or it's late. Last time the excuse was "they forgot". Worse thing is when they include the tip for a party of 6 or more, how do you deserve a tip if you don't give a proper service?? If people go to your restaurant to eat, why do you give the worst service? Not going back any time soon.< /Text>

Our to go to place to have Salvadoran food. Great food, clean restaurant, and good service. Reasonable priced. The only negative is the tiny restroom stall doors that touch your knees as you sit on the toilet, thankfully they have a unisex restroom that is big.</review>

<review>I recently came here about 3 weeks ago with my husband. We had the waiter sit us down and he took our drinks. The waiter walked off and we waited for someone to take our order for over 40 min. The waiter was just flirting and talking to the other waitresses in the back. And no one once came to see if we needed to be attended to. So we got up and walked out without paying and they didn't even notice.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I had the pork and cheese pupusas and chicken tamales and both were very good. The pupusas me me pretty full so I couldn't order as much food as I wanted to so it would prob be a good idea to share one instead. Next time I would wanna try the soup or entree.< /Text>

<text>I'm salvi and I recognize a good pupuseria when I taste it. Unfortunately, getting a waiter/waitress to your table can be a challenge. The waiters can be spotted chit chatting at the front counter instead of attending to the customers needs. Sometimes you might feel like ordering something additional on top of your initial order...good luck with that. I've been here many times and each time the waiters never seem to understand that more orders=more money< /text>< pics>

The.    "WORST RESTAURANT"
I ordered Pupusas asked to have the pupusas without Pork meat
And the Rude Sarcastic Waitress brought me Pupusas without anything just the Pork meat
I returtn the pupusas and ordered sopa de pollo the chiken meat tasted bad and so i told her to change that for a different plate because of that issue and he said that's how i asked the soup to be
So i said no i only said i do not want them hot!

< Review>
Love the pupusas!! I had never had a problem ordering over the phone but I did yesterday and the way they responded regarding waiting 20 min to try and order food was unprofessional. I Called today and spoke with the person and charged of that shift and they were more than nice and assured me they would fix the problem.< /Review>

Great traditional salvadorian meals. Prices are fair compared to other restaurants. Nice for family get togethers. Music is always playing and seems to be a tad bit to loud. You need to raise your voice to communicate with the person across from you.</Review>

Food is good like home cooking, love there soups and pupusas. Good serving. But they take for ever to get your order on time  dont come here very hungry. Eat a little before you do. That's how long it takes (30-45) min. To get your order to your table.</review>

Went there for breakfast and ordered pupusas. Waited a long time for my order to arrive because it turned out the server completely forgot. After mentioning this at the register, the person there said pupusas are complicated to make! This is not a reason for the server to forget my order. As others have mentioned, they don't apologize for mistakes but give excuses instead.< /text>

<text>I'm not one that's for prejudice. I don't believe in it or even practice it but I see it's practiced by the empliempl here. I didn't feel welcomed at all. My belizeane fiance brought me here to get a bite to eat and after seeing their inpleasant dispositions I didn't want to eat the food they served in fear they may have done something to it. Never coming here again. He took me to this same restaurant but located on South Vermont and we we're treated royally.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Came here on Easter Sunday forgot to post. Anywho, the service was fast but like others mentioned they do forget things and also the waitress are rude the one who served us wouldn't give me sunny side up eggs ...she said they came scrambled woman tell them to make my eggs this way and that's it....When she asked what we wanted to drink I said horchata she said es horchata salvadorena...b**** I know i am at a salvadorean restaurant ...she must of noticed my Mexican accent lol then she forgot my chorizo in the miguelitos breakfast ....not coming here anymore....by the way my husband that eats everything was actually not even impressed with the food. And he didn't even tip the waitress....be nice and you'll make mula...it's all about the attitude lady< /Text>

I want to say that the food is very delicious, but all the servers give a very bad service always wait until more than 30 minutes and they only serve the food and they do not show up to ask if everything is ok oh we occupy something to ask for something else we have to  get up to the counter to ask for things, bad service<//Review>

If we there again which I don't think will be soon is better to bring cash or go to another pupuseria at last flavor is quite similar in all the pupuserias just price is different.

<review>I sat at a table watching people come after me and get served before me also the wait staff walked by several times and it wasn't till I flagged somebody down that I got service. Oh and I had to take my coffee cup to the front to get a refill (yes a waitress walked by the dining area filling other people's cups)< /review>< name>

<Text>BAD FOOD
I  asked for a CHUCO atol and it's the worst I have ever seen, tasted and very expensive. They served me thin hot water without the look or taste of a real CHUCO. The pupusas are very thick but it's only corn masa, they barely have any cheese and chicharon inside. My advice to you is, if you are in the area go to PUPUSERIA EL CERRO VERDE. It is only about 3 miles away from this horrible place.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< Pics>

This place is now one of my favorites to get an authentic pupusas revuelta, pastelitos de carne (meat mixed w/veggies in a bun) and frescos like Ensalada (mixed fruit juice and real fruit served over ice) in the South Bay.  The pastelitos are made to order, served w/curtido (pickled cabbage) and come 2 per order.  The pupusas are made to order as well and served with a distinctive curtido that looked like it was glowing!  It was sooo cool to see that but the best part is biting into that pupusa revuelta w/curtido and salsa de tomate (tomato sauce).   Of course you cannot forget the ENSALADA!!!  With this summer weather it beats the thirst w/an Ensalada over ice!  Next visit I'll definitely try the tamales, Salpicón, Sopa de Gallina and the Yuca!  Pictures will be posted soon!<//Review>

<Text>I have been there a few times but these last two times that I have gotten my order to go I got hair on my food! The only reason why I would get my order to go is because of the horrible/rude employees they have there.  Now finding hair on my food twice on my pupusas? DISGUSTING! Definitely do not recommend this place!< /Text><userid>111365244067578827415< /userid><username>R21</username>< Pics>

waitress (the oldest one) might or might not be married to the owner,  she is stuck in third world country el salvador, nasty attitude, will Hand you your plate,  not serve you,  hand you as in giving you your hot plate on your hands instead of on the table as Normal waiters around the world do,  even in China and Mongolia they do it. I don't even know why they let her do that but when her friends come over she is the sweetest witch in town.< /review>

Went there recommended by a coworker with the promise of the best pupusas ever! She was right! So delicious and fully loaded not like other places. However, I arrived during a shift change and the waitresses were so afraid to give us good service due to the tip going to our first waitress and the service having to be provided by the new waitress coming in. Had to wait for 30 minutes before anyone asked if we needed anything else (my food went cold) and that was after I had to stand up and aproach the register. So money hungry for those tips, it's sad. I gave a $10 cash tip on a $25 check to the new waitress just to make a point rather than in appreciation of good service which I have no problem doing to a well deserved service but this was ridiculous I myself have never let the tip be an issue with my service and wish management would teach these people the same principles to keep guest coming in often rather than being discouraged by the horrible service and attitude of the employees. Get your food to go!<//text>

So my two sons invited me to this place. We ordered the normal stuff some pupusas a 7 mares and some platanos. They bring my sons pupusas first, he was able to eat all his food 30 min after my 7 mares and my otger sons platanos still havent came and i am forced to go to the front where some mad looking lady told me to wait another 40min for my food. This is were i said no more waiting asked the lady to give me the check and were force to leave due to the bad service. I recommend not to come here for a quick bite to eat unless you like waiting 2 hours for platanos and a soup.</text>

The waitresses are incredibly rude to the point where they make you feel uncomfortable. That is nothing compared to the disgusting hair I pulled out of my mouth after biting into one of their pupusas, and that was not all. I found another one underneath the platanos fritos. I have been there 2 times and both times I got hair, what are the odds of that? I called the place and they told me I should have left it alone and to bring it to them so they can see it. They couldn't even apologize. The canned sodas are fine.<//text>

Literally this place keeps getting worse and worse. This is what... the 5th time they've managed to screw up the order. I don't understand how hard is it to keep track? Coming different pupusas? Have different comales assigned that way you don't screw up. I've always had the damn misfortune of either getting the wrong one, or one missing. Hell. Even my mom's pupusas are way better than this. And the curtido? Don't get me started on it. The salsa? Ni se diga. 🤦🏻‍♀️ this place is just a complete utter fail at best.</Text>

Worst service !! Ordered a sopa de gallina and 3 pupusas de chicharron con queso. We received the chicken first then the soup 5mins later and the pupusas no where to be found!!! Perhaps they were being made directly from El Salvador.  Ridiculous ruined my lunch. Had to settle with pizza hut smh even they were on time!  Not the first something like this happens.  3/22/2017<//Review>

I have been a regular customer to "El Nuevo San Miguel" since the Restaurant has opened business; nevertheless, I have never been so repulsed by not only the HAIR in my food, but by how the owner of the Restaurant dealt with the incident. Halfway through my meal I felt a hair-like-texture in my mouth, as expected I took a long strand of hair out of my mouth. I spit the food out and a kind server came to help. I explained to her what had happened, she was very attentive and she showed the owner the strand of hair. He continued to not only sit, but he also never came to offer his aapologies. Instead he made a comment regarding, not to worry they shower everyday. Despite the comment being rude, it was extremly unprofessional on his behalf. Furthermore, they still charged me half price for my meal. Luckily, the kind and attentive server had taken the meal out of the tab.

To the owner: Extremly unprofessional. It would be highly recommended to not only have your cooks wear proper hair restraints, but for your servers to have them as well.

Kind server: Thank you for helping me, and offering me anything else. Your attentiveness is very much noticed. Dont stay in this restaurant for long! You have extreme potential!

Restaurant: Good food>Reasonable prices>Inspect food if ordered.<//Text>< pictures>

Service is really bad, they tend to forget items when they serve you your food, worst customer service ever, I only order 2 pupusas and it took more than 30 mins & when I reminded them they got mad and serve me a pupusa that look like it felt on the floor< /Text>

Yes, I am not going to deny it, they serve good food but they have very bad service. My first visit I ordered sopa de pata and my family ordered pupusas to eat inside. My family finished eating their pupusas and the waitress never came with my soup... I was very very very disappointed and hungry. 2 times, 2 different waitress came to my table to check if all was ok, I said: I am missing my soup, she said: Oh in few minutes it will be ready... come on twice waitress said  the same thing??? . I waited 49 minutes and finally I said please just put to go.
Yesterday, I was just there again and this time I ordered 6 pupusas to go, they gave me the order all wrong, when I got home found out they gave me 5 pupusas but they charged me for 6.
Not going to this awful service place ever and don't recommend it to no one. Loud music, you hardly hear whatever conversation you are having in your table. too long waiting period and too long to be served.
The owner/ manager should look into how to have more employees so customers don't wait 49 minutes to be served after the order was taken.<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) How sad, I always liked tamales, but now I made an order of elites and chicken. The horrible corn ones didn't even taste like corn and the chicken ones the masa had no flavor. Lousy, lousy. I will not recommend it, much less consume, unless you talk to your cooks.

(Original)
Que triste,  siempre  me gustaron los tamales, pero ahora hice una orden de élites y de pollo. Los de elote horribles ni siquiera sabían a elote y los de pollo la masa no tenía sabor .

<review>(Translated by Google) I really like the food, but today is the first time that I tried to order my food to go and I was dialing more than half an hour and nobody answered me, not to tell me that they no longer take take out baking and when I got to the restaurant and came back To dial the cashier she did not answer the phone and I asked her why she did not answer and she told me that they were very saturated, I told her that it was better to answer and say that they were no longer taking take out orders.
At that time there is no one to speak, there is no person in charge or manager

(Original)
La verdad la comida me gusta, pero hoy es la primera ves que trate de pedir mi comida para llevar y estuve marcando mas de media hora y nadie me contesto, no para decierme que ya no tomavan hordenea para llevar y cuando llegue al restaurant  y volvi a marcar la cajera no contestava el telefono y le pregunte que por que no contestava y me dijo que estaban muy saturados, le dije que hera mejor contestar y decir que ya no estaban tomando hordenes para llevar.
En ese monento no avia nadie para hablar, no hay una persona encargada o manager< /review>< pictures>

Of the many times that I have come "el atol de elote" they always give it warm. Very bad. Why his atol is expensive and so that they give it to him lukewarm. Do not!! This time I didn't even tell them. It is seen that they will not change. And something else. If you don't know how to make corn atol, better take it off the menu. Ijole men! An atol all squeaky. I think one ear they used for 5 gallons of milk.

(Original)
Se arruino el Nuevo San Miguel. De las muchas veces que he venido "el atol de elote" siempre lo dan tibio. Muy mal. Por qué su atol esta carito y para que se lo den tibio. ¡¡No!! Esta vez ya ni les dije. Esta visto que no van a cambiar. Y algo más. Si no saben hacer atol de elote, mejor saquenlo del menú. Ijole men! Un atol todo chirlo. Creo que de una mazorca usaron para 5 galones de leche.< /Review><UserId.>106181076899077719965</UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>1</rating>< date>

(Translated by Google) The tamales were very rich and juicy but some time ago they are salty and for the scrubbing I think the cosinera is different. The point is that Mother was already worth it. No more tamales.

(Translated by Google) Today I called at 2:20 pm the reason is that this was the third time that I bought pupusas WITH QUEZO and the three times I did not find them a quezo and if they put it is a great misery what they put, the supposed pupusas do not saven a pupusas I am even ashamed to share with a friend eating these things because they are horrible I do not recommend to anyone buy here better go to the green hill those if they are pupusas. I buy here because they are close to where I live, they are not worth it, better I go to the places where they make them tasty even if I stay a little far away.

(Original)
Hoy llame como alas 2:20pm la razon es que esta fue la tercera vez que les e conprado pupusas CON QUEZO y las tres veces no les encontre quezo y si le ponen es una gran miseria la que ponen, las supuestas pupusas no saven a pupusas hasta me dad verguenza conpartirle a una amistad comer estas cosas por que estan horribles no le recomiendo a nadie conprar aqui mejor vayan al cerro verde esas si son pupusas. Yo conpre aqui por estar cerca de donde vivo no valen la pena mejor me voy a los lugares donde las hacen sabrosas aunque me quede algo lejos.</text>

Not half a star

<review>(Translated by Google) The food is good, I don't know why they think good service, the service is lousy, today I went to eat and the time I was there, nobody left a tip for the bad service I asked for sauce and until I asked the waitress again and she brought it to me when The meal had already finished and as always the waiters do not even approach to ask if they need something more waiters waitresses the tip is earned for the service they give until they get angry when one asks them for something I no longer take my family anymore, it hurts I love them their pupusas but terrible service

La comida está buena yo no se por que opinan buen servicio  esta pésimo el servicio hoy fui a comer y el tiempo que estuve ahí nadie dejó propina por el mal servicio pedí salsa y hasta que no le volví a pedir la mesera y me lo arrimó cuando ya abia terminado la comida y como siempre  los meseros ni se arriman a preguntar si nesecita algo más meseros meseras la propina se gana por el servicio que dan hasta se enojan cuando uno les pide algo yo ya no llevo nunca más a mi familia lastima me encantan sus pupusas pero pésimo servicio</review></record>

(Translated by Google) If you are going to buy in this restaurant make sure to go out with your food that you ordered because there is always a need for food every time my family has ordered they always need something or they do not put tanning or Pupusas are missing or they forget to put sauce or they charge you double your order and then they don't want to give you your money back, the people who work there don't know how to treat their customers. I have given them a star because no, the system does not allow zero stars. The food is ok. The service is very bad. order when the customer arrives and make sure the order is complete I think that would increase the takeaway service 09/20/2020

(Original)
Si vas a comprar en este restaurante asegúrate de salir con tu comida que ordenaste porque siempre hace falta comida todas las veces que mi familia a ordenado siempre les hace falta algo o no le ponen curtido o faltan Pupusas o se les olvida poner salsa o te cobran doble tu orden  y después no te quieren regresar tu dinero  la gente que trabaja ahí no sabe cómo tratar a la clientela les he puesto una estrella porque no el sistema no deja poner cero estrellas  aclaró la comida está ok  el servicio es muy malo deberían repetir la orden al llegar el cliente y asegurarse que la orden esté completa creo que eso haría subir el servicio para llevar 09/20/2020< /review>

(Translated by Google) They are shameless ones they are selling expired food they sold me a sour chilate
Also in the cabbage of the pupusas a nance seed came out, it seems that they recycle the tanning that the clients leave. I invite all those who go to eat to look at the rating that the city has given them.

Son unos sin vergüenzas están vendiendo comida vencida me vendieron un chilate agrio

<review>(Translated by Google) If there is the unpleasant fact that your waitress can dislike you, then that happened to my wife and me in this place; twice!
The food is ok, but by bad luck we had to be given an unacceptable service. There are waiters who only show kindness at the time of the tip. I have no objection to that, but the tip has to be deserved.
A good place deserves better supervision.

(Original)
Si existe el desagradable hecho de que le puedes caer mal a tu mesera, pues eso nos ocurrió a mi esposa y a mi en este lugar; ¡dos veces!
La comida is ok, pero por mala suerte nos tocó que nos dieran un servicio inaceptable.  Hay mesera/os que solo muestran amabilidad a la hora de la propina.  No tengo ninguna objeción a eso, pero la propina tiene que ser merecida.
Un buen lugar, merece mejor supervisión.< /review>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) The bean soup was cold and tasteless
The volume of the rocola is exaggerated, you cannot talk, the parking lot is wide
The treatment of the staff, mainly that of one of the waitresses who seems to be a poorly unemployed soldier, treats one as if if she were to ask for alms, I treat my friend badly, she never served her coffee and in a disgusting and rude way she said, Do you want it or not?
Definitely a lousy service ....

(Original)
La sopa de frijoles estaba fría y sin sabor
El volumen de la rocola es exagerado, no se puede conversar, el estacionamiento está amplio
El trato del personal, principalmente el de una de las meseras que parece soldado mal parado, lo trata a uno como que si llegara a pedir limosna, trato mal a mi amiga, nunca le sirvió el café y de forma repugnante y grosera le dijo, lo quiere o no lo quiere?
Definitivamente un pésimo servicio....< /Review>

<username>Carmen Paez</username><time>1577576579558<//time><review>(Translated by Google) Very bad service My husband and I went today. It took a long time to take the order. After an eternity, they brought my husband's pupusas, but neither covered nor anything else. After a while a waitress brought them. My husband had to stop another waiter and ask for his drink. Of my order, nothing. When my husband almost finished eating, I went to cancel the rest of the order. The same waiter came to offer me a tamale, because he said he was sorry that I left without eating. And that my food was coming. I didn't accept it because I can't eat it. But my husband said to bring my food, if it was ready. I know that someone else's order brought me, because it was not what I asked for. But they never brought me anything to drink, nor the rest of my husband's order. I ate a little, so that my husband did not feel bad, but the food already tasted bitter, and then no water to drink. So we better decided to leave. I went to pay, and although the same waiter attended to me, with grief and everything, he charged me the full bill. Of course, he offered me a glass, to take my soup! My daughter told me that I should pay only what they served us, or claim what they did NOT bring us, but we were not the only ones, another woman was claiming what was missing. So I decided to give my money to the restaurant, but put this comment so that others know what to expect, if they decide to go. Maybe they CANNOT, even if they want, give good service, because before it was, for me, 5 stars. Pity.

(Original)
Muy mal servicio.  Mi esposo y yo  fuimos hoy.  Tardaron  mucho en tomar la orden.Despues de una eternidad, trajeron las pupusas  de mi esposo,  pero ni cubiertos,  ni nada más.  Después de un rato una mesera los trajo.  Mi esposo tuvo que  parar a otro mesero y pedirle su bebida.  De mi orden,  nada.  Cuando mi esposo casi terminaba de comer,  fui a cancelar el resto de la orden.  El mismo mesero me vino a  ofrecer un tamal, porque dijo que le daba pena que me fuera sin comer.  Y que ya venía  mi comida. No lo acepté por que no puedo comerlo. Pero mi esposo dijo que trajera mi comida, si ya estaba lista.  Sé que  me trajo la orden de alguien más,  porque no fue lo que yo pedí.  Pero nunca me trajeron nada de tomar,  ni el resto de la orden de mi esposo. Me comí un poco, para  que  mi esposo no se  sintiera mal, pero la comida ya me  sabía  amarga, y luego ni agua para tomar.!!!Así que mejor  decidimos irnos.  Fui a pagar,  y  aunque me atendió el mismo mesero,  con pena y  todo,  me cobró la cuenta completa. Eso sí,  me ofreció un   vaso,  para  que me llevara  mi sopa!!! Me dijo mi hija que  debí pagar sólo lo que nos sirvieron,  o reclamar lo que NO nos trajeron,  pero  no fuimos los únicos,  otra mujer estaba reclamando lo que le faltaba.  Así que decidí  regalarle mi dinero al restaurante,  pero poner éste comentario para que otros sepan qué esperar, si deciden ir. Tal vez NO PUEDEN,  aunque quieran,  dar buen  servicio,  porque antes era,  para mí, de  5 estrellas.  Lástima.</review><GmapID>0x80c2b5881eea7d95:0x9396d759ebab7c35< /GmapID>< UserId.>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very good service, delicious food. Traditional Flavors, excellent presentation, very good taste and flavor. They can be combined with the flavors of traditional soft drinks to their respective meals and various tastes of the diners. Flavor; Smell and adequate temperature, in a warm, traditional and typical environment in the context of food. We feel more than well cared for and comfortable, with excellent suggestion and attention from the mosos, very ample parking space and handicap accessible and with clean and well maintained accessible restrooms.

<Review>(Translated by Google) I am 100% Salvadoran and since I was recommended the new San Miguel I go frequently very often all the food is delicious and I congratulate the only thing that happens is when I order the bread with chicken does not carry enough juice or sauce of the same chicken and it is not because what they charge or cost or what is asked for extra juice but they charge it to the truth they would not have to bring that up because I eat the chicken bread as a cosinera, it has to take a lot of juice to call it that

Soy 100% salvadoreña y desde q me recomendaron  el nuevo  San miguel  voy  frecuentemente  muy seguido  todas las comida estan  deliciosas   y los felicito lo  unico q pasa es cuando ordeno el pan con pollo  no lleva el suficiente jugo  o salsa del mismo  pollo  y no es por lo que cobren o cuesta o lo que  se  pida extra jugo pero  se lo  cobran a uno la verdad no deverian  Acer eso porque  yo como  cosinera   el pan con pollo  tiene que  llevar mucho  jugo para  llamarse asi</Review>< resp>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Whenever I go to eat there with my friend and their daughter, they always serve the first one. My friend finishes eating and I keep waiting for my food, I think it should not be this way, they should organize so that the customers enjoy the food Same time. Because it is very uncomfortable to see people eating or to be seen eating, when the goal of getting there is to eat together while talking while enjoying the dish. Enfoquence in giving fast attention, serving everyone equally.
I hope I do not have that problem again.
Thank you!!!

Siempre que voy a comer ahí con mi amigo y su hija, siempre  le sirven a el primero termina de comer mi amigo y yo sigo esperando mi comida, creo que no tendría que ser así, deberian de organizarce para que los clientes disfrutemos la comida al mismo tiempo. Porque es muy incómodo ver comer o que lo vean comer, cuando el objetivo de llegar ahí es comer juntos conversar mientras se disfruta del platillo. Enfoquence en dar una atención rápida, sirviendo a todos por igual.
Espero no tener de nuevo ese problema.
Gracias!!!<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I have already had several bad experiences here in this restaurant, Eliseo was the waiter who attended us, what bad service they give, they bring the food one by one, if they make a mistake in the order they are not able to apologize, or to change The food for not losing a plate of food loses customers, they do not have good service or customer satisfaction, tortillas very badly made, burnt empanadas, and not a smile to captivate customer service and that the customer leaves happy, satisfied And I am invited to return, I definitely do not recommend it, the seasoning is not good either, so I still think the same as 2 and 3 years ago that for reasons of no choice I have had to return to this place.

Yo ya he tenido varias malas experiencias aquí en este restaurante, Eliseo fue el mesero que nos atendio, qué mal servicio dan, traen la comida de a una por una, si se equivocan en la orden no son capaces de pedir disculpas, o de cambiar la comida por no perder un plato de comida pierden los clientes, no tienen buen servicio ni satisfacción al cliente, las tortillas muy mal hechas, empanadas quemadas, y ni una sonrisa para cautivar la atención al cliente y que el cliente se vaya contento, satisfecho y quede invitado a regresar, yo definitivamente,  no lo recomiendo,  el sazón tampoco es  bueno,  así que sigo pensando igual que hace 2 y hace 3 años que por cuestiones de no opción he tenido que regresar a éste lugar.👎👎👎👎<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2b5881eea7d95:0x9396d759ebab7c35</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) The food is always cold, and their prices are more expensive every day and they only give you what they want you can not change or the eggs scrambled by crashes. The bad service, you always have to be asking to bring one or another thing that you order. Besides, you can not hear or even think that there's always a lot of noise ... I'm not coming back !!

(Original)
La comida siempre fria, y  sus precios cada dia mas caroy solo te dan lo que ellos quieren no puedes cambiar ni los huevos revuelto por estrellados. El servicio malo, siempre tienes que estar pidiendo que te traigan una o otra cosa que ordenes. Aparte que no puedes oir ni tue pensamiento por que siempre ayi muchisimo ruido... NO vuelvo!!<//review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) We often go to this restaurant, we went with my family, and my sister asked for a salad (drink) and was eating the fruit when a big hair came out, we complained and they changed it but then to eat a soup 7 seas we went with my husband when They looked at hairs swimming in the soup, we told him that we no longer wanted it and since we had even ordered to go, we said no, so a waitress with green eyes or honey color, got angry and very rude, said that it happened everywhere and I asked for the manager and he did not want to call him and all rude said that we will pay quickly and practically took us out, too rude, really the food is good, but very bad attention and little hygiene

(Original)
Nosotros vamos con frecuencia a este restaurante, fuimos con mi familia, y mi hermana pidió una ensalada (bebida) y estaba comiéndose la fruta cuando salió un gran pelo, reclamamos y la cambiaron pero luego a comer una sopa 7 mares íbamos con mi esposo cuando se miraban pelos nadando en la sopa, le dijimos que ya no la queríamos y como habíamos pedido hasta para llevar, dijimos que ya no, entonces una mesera de ojos verdes o color miel, se enojó y bien grosera dijo que eso en todos lados pasaba y yo pregunté por el mánager y no quiso llamarlo y toda grosera dijo que pagaremos rápido y prácticamente nos sacó, demasiado grosera, realmente la comida está buena, pero muy mala atención y poca higiene</Review>

(Translated by Google) The pupusas are mediocre the service is not the best. It is a pity that a place does not have someone to make pupusas as they should be and good service.
Stewed meat I do not recommend it tastes like tinned food. The fried rice was almost raw ..

<Review>(Translated by Google) Nice place but the service leaves much to look forward to good horror the weather q Ay q wait for the food. + If you ask them they get angry they start making faces and it takes much longer. I had to wait 41 minutes for the 2 pupusas of my 1 year old. My friend asked for 2 beans with cheese and they gave her 2 juices. They have no juices for a child and apart I asked for 5 pupusas to take away and wait an hour and at the last I canceled the order and by chance the order was ready. And still the cashier was upset because I did not say thank you just to apologize for my rudeness I gave him the 5 pupusas that I waited so long ...

(Original)
Bonito lugar pero el servicio deja mucho que desiar bueno un horror el  tiempo q Ay q esperar por la comida. + si les preuntas se enojan te empiesan aser caras y se tardan mucho mas.  tube q esperar 41 mnts para las 2 pupusas de mi niño de 1 año. Mi amiga pidio 2 de frijol con queso y le dieron 2s revueltas No tienen jugos para niño  y aparte  pedi 5 pupusas para llevar y espere una horas y al ultimo cancele la orden y de casualidad en ese momento la orden esta lista. Y todavia el cajero se molesto porq no dije gracias sólo para disculpar mi mala educación le regale las 5 pupusas q tanto espere...< /Review>< date>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I was in this dining room this afternoon if you can call it hasi and it was a very bad taste experience
Special with one of the waitress of Name Alejandra an unprofessional person and Vulgar, sheet The owner can talk to her and give her a customer service training
Going to the food is good only that the canteen table brought me all wrong and I had to explain 3 times so that I would understand what I had ordered at the beginning but he did not care.
But well, what can I expect from a place disguised as a restaurant if in the background is a vulgar dining room.
Hojala q my Paisano's q come to this beautiful country of tourists and they know what to do with this New San Miguel and the Wait was 55 minutes for something so simple to prepare, even if the owner of the restaurant advised you to change or better train your employees att.Fernando Dueñas.

Estube esta tarde en este comedor si sele puede llama hasi y fue una experiencia de muy mal gusto
Especial con una de la mesera de Nombre Alejandra una persona antiprofecional y Vulgar, hojala El dueño pueda hablar con Ella y darle un devido entrenamiento de customer service
Pasando ala comida es Buena solo q la meserita de cantina me trajo Todo mal y le tube q explicar 3 veses para q me entendiera lo que le havia ordenado Al principio pero no le importo.
Pero bueno q puedo esperar de un lugar disfrasado de restaurant si en El fondo es un vulgar comedor.
Hojala q mis Paisano's q vienen a este hermozo pais de turistas ya saven a que a tenerse con este Nuevo San Miguel y la Espera fue de 55 minutos para algo tan sencillo de preparar hasi q señor dueño del restaurant le aconsejo cambios o entrenar mejor a sus empleados att.Fernando Dueñas.<//Text></record>

They told me that I could not withdraw The atol and that they could not remove it from the bill. It's lucky I'm not problematic ... but if I wanted to comment here so they know The kind of person that old man is
