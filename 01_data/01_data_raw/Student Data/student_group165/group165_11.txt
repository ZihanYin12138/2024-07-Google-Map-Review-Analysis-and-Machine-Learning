We were looking for a good Mongolian restaurant and found it here! 5 stars: All you can eat, quality, taste and price, portion.< /Review>

<Review>My family and I stop by for Mongolian BBQ everytime we are in Moreno Valley.  I have always had a great experience.  Last week, I was really disappointed.  The fried food tasted like it was cooked in old grease.  The shrimp fried rice was dry and the shrimp didn't taste good.  The soup had a strong seafood taste.  I had to throw most of the food away.  My family would not eat it.< /Review>< userid>

No more All You Can Eat, but the only way you'll find out is by having "one bowl" shouted at you when you try to order it. Food is awesome though.<//Review>

<user_name>geovani martinez<//user_name><text>I went with my wife to eat yesterday for the 5th time and we got our food and took it to the chef to cook, everytime we had went it was an all you can eat buffet as it is advertised on the restaurants window, but this time the lady wanted to charge us for every plate we would get saying that though its a buffet we could only get food one time and that we would be charged for every plate we got after the first time, she also didnt know how to explain why she was trying to charge us for every plate we got so we ended up leaving, we had been coming here for years and they have lost a customer due to their false advertisement, this is no longer an all you can eat buffet</text>< Time>

<review>They provide generous portions and for inexpensive rates. We enjoyed the food very much and the staff members were very amiable and chatty. Will definitely recommend this spot.Tables were clean and in good shape. No offensive smells. Food was prepared and cooked in quick and efficient manner.

Was greeted as I walked in the door. Tables were clean and in good shape. No offensive smells. Food was prepared and cooked in quick and efficient manner. Everything I had ordered was very delicious and hot when it was served to me. It’s best to come here hungry because there is plenty of food to eat.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I've been here a number of times (lunch and dinner, over the past 3 years or so) and have always had a great experience. The decor isn't much to look at, but all of the food I've had has been extremely fresh and well-prepared. The buffet has a good variety, and all of the fresh veggies are beautiful. And you can't beat the price! Added bonus - I've got fairly serious food allergies, and the way they heat the food, it keeps your stuff on a single space on the griddle. I've been to other Mongolian places where they move the food across the whole griddle, so your stuff gets a lot of contamination from other peoples' plates, but here, your food stays on one section of the griddle until it is done.</Review>< Pics>

I ordered from this restaurant today.  Best I’ve ever had. Loaded with shrimp and all the good stuff.

Food is pretty good. You build your own plate of noodles. So you get to choose the veggies, meat, and sauces you want with it. Definitely more worth if you come for lunch time.</Text>

Although the food is tasty. The signs are very misleading!! They tell you one bowl for $7.99 then they charge you for an extra bowl for the noodles. My husband and I ate here & we each got one bowl but we were charged an all-you-can-eat price! I thought the noodles and the vegetables & meat and sauces were all included in that price but apparently not. Just be aware that you will be charged extra for the noodles!!
We got two bowls and Ice Tea & it  was $30!!
Unfortunately We won't be back!!< /Review>

<review>It’s very good food however, besides messing up my order (they fixed it of course) I started eating my food and found big piece of paper in my food. I really like this place because I sometimes come here but with this experience I will be rethinking on coming again, it took a while for them to fix me order after I told them they did something wrong and the cashier lady looked angry at me like if messed it up. Disappointed< /review>< Pics>

Clean, readonly priced and plenty of fresh toppings. What's really nice is that they don't have a few meats to add, they have several! Lamb, Turkey, Chicken, Pork, Crab, and Beef! That's a solid offering not to mention tons of veggies and sauces for toppings. The staff has been very friendly each time I've visited and the food is always good. Sure smokes the Mongolian BBQ places in the malls, that's for sure!</Text>

<Review>Come here for lunch all the time. Staff is friendly and attentive, but hard to understand. The Mongolian BBQ is great. Lunch special price is great. When it's busy, you can go on both sides of the food area. They have menu items too but it's basic Chinese food and pretty low quality.<//Review>< username>

Mongolian BBQ Moreno valley is a good place to enjoy the Mongol bbq when you have that taste desire.  Good selection and they do a nice job cooking.  Just a nice place to eat.<//Review>

<Review>WARNING!!!!!!! This place is terrible! I paid $30 dollars for rock hard, flavorless food! I will never eat here again. The food was by no means worth $30 dollars. The idiots combined my plate with another, which really screwed up my mix. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!! The employees hardly speak english, which only made the communication that much more difficult, after I did my best to be kind regarding the terrible, rock hard food and poor service!!!!!!!!!

<text>The worst customer service.  This place would be great if the "manager" learned how to provide proper customer service. This woman who claims to be the manager was extremely rude . She brought the wrong order out and when we asked for utencils and napkins she proceeded to point to where the napkins and utencils were. She never brought them I had to get up and get them myself. Mind you there were no other people there. When it came time to pay i  asked for a box she compleately ignored me.  I had to ask another man if he could get me a box. Then when I asked how much she pointed to the register. Idk what her issue was but if she hates attending to customers she is in the wrong business.<//text>< user_name>

I was there today for the 1st time.
For those that haven't had Mongolian BBQ yet It's just like Hitachi you choose your type of meat your veggies,spices add ons(onions,pepers,cilantro,scallions,jalapenos etc....)And than your sauces of preference. It can be hot or not+noddles.They have egg holls or dumplings as appetizers if you prefer you can choose (all ypu can eat or a box.(mixed up all ingredients u choose in one box.
Its Absolutely delicious.
They have Fountain drinks and a fe variety of ice tea and supposedly Peak ice tea.That is the only reason why they will Not get 5 stars from me bcz there was np other flavor of peak ice tea avalaible then raspberry ,sweet tea and unsweetened was all water.
Butthe place was clean prices wete reasonable .Good customer service.
I recomend.<//text>

You have to to ask for drink refills, I've actually just got up and refilled my own drink on a few occasions, and you have to tell them what you ordered when you go to pay which is annoying...  Also although they don't want anyone to know (which was obvious by the way they hid that I was getting them) you can get 5 free OLD FISHY TASTING shrimp 1x only...< /Review></record>

<response>None</response><Review>This restaurant is surprisingly healthy and tasty!  The way it works is that you get a bowl or two and fill it with veggies, frozen strips of meat and you get a bowl of egg drop soup, rice and bread.  Of course you can go low carb and ditch the rice, bread and noodles and getting only veggies and meat which makes it pretty tasty.  You can buy the all you can eat deal and go back for as many helpings as you'd like.  Part of me is kinda put off because the veggies seem to be canned and the meat is obviously frozen so there's no way to really know the quality of the food you're eating.<//Review><Date>1453785731354< /Date></record>

The food is great, the place is clean, and the workers are nice. However recently their was a very nice man who worked their who did a spectacular job waiting me and my family, we gave him a $5 dollar tip and he looked at us with fear in his eyes and said "is she looking". An Asian woman, the manager perhaps, was observing the man cruely. When we went outside we noticed the woman yelling at him as he cleaned where we ate and where others ate as well. Eventually we watched the woman snatch the tip we gave out of his pocket (she put his hands on him obviously). I've never seen such a cruel person in the work place, and the act of placing her hands on him is illegal I'm pretty sure. My mom and dad ran in to confront her with no luck of changing her perspective, something must be done about this woman. Other the place is nice.<//text>

Food is great and all, but when we asked for an interview for my class project they were so rude about it, I understand it’s their right to say no, but they were very rude about it. They also were giving my friends and I cruel stares and looks when we tried to talk to their cooks to get their perspective on the restaurant, something must be done the women and man are very rude.</Text><name>Melanie Ortiz< /name>< userid>

Make sure you grab more than one bowl to split up your ingrediants as there is not a maximum bowl amount that the staff will mix. Make sure to put plenty of sauces in it to give the BBQ some extra taste. The hot sauce will definitely kick it up a  notch.

The desert table leaves a bit to be desired but the cake was surprisingly good.<//review>< Pics>

Bad customer service !
Lady does not understand English and served us eggrolls to substitute egg soup but never said she was going to charge us. She did not want to take it off bill.  Bad experience.< /Review>

You got alot of choices in meats (chicken, beef, turkey, lamb, imitation crab, and pork).

I went there for the first time today because I was curious about trying Mongolian beef and I'm glad this was the place I went to. You get to fill up a bowl with whatever you want and as much as u want. I had trouble with mine as I didn't know you could seriously put a bunch of food in it and the man there helped me...he added more chowmein and filled it with sauces.....it was very delicious....very friendly staff too.....go to this place, like SERIOUSLY!!</Text>

It's a great price, but the food itself is ok, not great.  I prefer the Mongolian BBQ place near UCR off university street.  It's a little bit more expensive but definitely worth the price because the quality and taste is exceptional.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The food is good, the bad thing is the Chinese lady who charges is looking at what you do and it seems that she is always angry she does not have good customer service I do not know how to speak English my Spanish I think I am afraid to go to school to learn the Chinese language ... .
..

(Original)

<review>(Translated by Google) Mongolian rotisserie with great weight for Taiwanese
Also a bit of a table meal
The taste is very salty and oily
Occasionally gathering with friends is suitable for 啰
a little bit accustomed to people 🙋

(Original)
對台灣人來說份量極大的蒙古烤肉店
也有點餐方式的桌菜
口味很鹹很油
偶爾跟朋友聚聚適合囉
稍微有點吃不慣的人🙋<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dca62d26f16fb5:0xbcfdbe4af0582c49</Gmap_id>< userid>

I left the store with my new phone and watch with all my information transferred to the new devices. The ability to have a pleasant customer service experience almost disappeared during the fakedemic but it never left this store. Thanks!< /review>< pics>

Kim did an amazing job juggling customers while working by herself.  She was friendly, knowledgeable and got us a great deal. I would give a 5 star review if employees had more support to help them do their jobs better and more efficiently.< /text>

Had problems in Verizon store. Clerk was rude and not very helpful. Called Verizon wait for assistance 12 to 15 minutes called dropped. No one to answer. Wow. Not happy!</Text>

Heather went above and beyond to help me out when my phone flew across the floor and shattered. When my new phone came in the following day Kyle was able to retrieve all of my contact information. These two wonderful people made an unpleasant experience turn into a great one!</Text>

<Review>This place is one of the reasons, I've stuck with Verizon. The staff is generally friendly and knowledgeable, although it often requires a wait as they can be quite busy. Over the years they've had some top notch people, but lately not quite as much. Since it is the only place in Kingsburg where one can walk in and get help with a phone problem, they seem to stay pretty busy.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Love living here..minus a neighbor or two. You get them everywhere though. Kidding aside, we love living here. My hubby and I are both disabled. Close to everything. Park improvements going on to make this place even prettier! Management super friendly, clean, quiet, dog friendly, close-knit community, close to beach, shopping, entertainment, golf course. Great amenities like a pool, jacuzzi, on site gym, laundry room, library, club house, vending machines and walking paths. What more do you need! And no, I was not paid to write this.

Nice retirement community on the edge of Seal Beach.  Walking distance to shops, restaurants, Marina Vista Park, Long Beach Marina and VA Hospital.  The park is currently undergoing MAJOR renovations, so there's a lot of construction and it seems "disheveled" at the moment, but it will really be lovely once completed.  Lots of community events,  BEAUTIFUL pool & spa.  Very friendly people and good management - ESPECIALLY Kathy Ferencik!</text>

I love the people and listening to their experiences while bumping into them on a beautiful california coastal day. So far the residents ive met are very community  motivated.  Understandably so because it is an adult park it creates a very simple yet understandable diversity. Because residents that have no connection with family and like living alone want their domain to remain the same the opposition is the influx of new residents would like to at least have 3 days in the summer to invite their families to visit. At least minors so the senior population get what they express they need to spend time with their grandkids preventing the next generation of elders to end up simply diverse children</Text>

My brother-in-law lived there many years and just loved it!  It is a beautiful place to live. When we visited him we always enjoyed the lovely walks and scenery. So much to do in the area as well!</review>

<user_id>102281476648636700763< /user_id><Review>Every time we order a to-go food , We have to wait very long. I think the restaurant should hire more people to work so that the customers don’t have to waste time to wait for 45 minutes sometimes even 1 hour.  It is very frustrating to wait for about 30 min - 1 hour during lunch time for one item order. I plan not to go there anymore. We do not want to waste 30-45 minutes sometimes even 1 hour to pick up the to-go food.  The restaurant should consider customer’s waiting time.  My family was a customer for many years but We are very unhappy about the service.< /Review>< GmapID>

Food is tasty but saturated with fillers. They had a good flow of ”to-go” orders, and maybe we ordered the wrong food.  The General Chicken had an overpowering thick sauce, and the Egg flower soup was watery and not your typical Chinese soup.  The restaurant has so much potential, but it needs to step up its game and offer more somewhat of the real Chinese food taste like.  Btw, the Boba drinks were dissappiting, not flavorful and has an after taste.</Text><Time>1547504433055</Time></record>

The Vegetable/rice and the Teriyaki rice bowls are delicious. Their Kungpow chicken is delicious too</Text>

Small but well spaced restaurant with classic tastefully executed dishes.

Simple menu keeps it easy and not overwhelming.

Fantastic service from lady at front counter great attitude and very knowledgable about the dishes.

Delicious milk tea for a reasonable price,
All around good pricing.

Deals of the day added a nice touch my coworker got his soft drink for free since we ordered more than 8$ worth of food.<//Review>

<Review>Looked around and found this place, The Boba House. Place is small, but food volume isn't. I ordered me a Kung Pao chicken rice bowl. What do ya know it, it tastes just like your typical $10 plus Chinese Restaurant! Food is wok prepared! Can't get that with most Chinese take out restaurants! I ate up, feel satisfied and went back on the road. I also got me a Capuccino smoothie as a dessert for the road! Will come back again if I'm here in town!<//Review>< pics>

This was my first time to this place, the woman working was very nice, and friendly. The food OMG it was fantastic...the vegtables in the rice bowls were fresh, and cooked perfectly with the right amount of crisp to them. I recommend this place if you like Chinese food.</text>

I have been visiting this place for the last 8 years. The portion is just perfect. Food is absolutely delicious. Kind owner and very friendly. We have tried most of their food in the menu including our fav KungPao Chicken. Also, do not forget to see the deal of the day. Sometimes you will get a free soda or wonton sup. Highly recomend place if you are craving for a tasty Chinese food.</review>

The cashier was rude, she was on the phone  and completely ignored me, it was  Not until another patron came in that she finally acknowledge me but she aknowledge them 1st even though  I first in line. I guess she did notice was being rude because at the she did thank me for coming.</Review>

<Text>The reality of the technicians in the repair bays are not those of the receptionist lady up front answering phones. She makes and schedules appointments for servicing your vehicle, without checking with the actual availability of man labor. Waited 4 hours and the under staffed technicians never get a chance to give me an estimate. Skip the receptionist talk, try to speak to the actual mechanics if you can, to get a realistic time frame. Otherwise, you are wasting your valuable time.<//Text>< pics>

My car was dropped off at 3:30. I was told I would receive a call today with quote and diagnostics of my alternator. No one ever called me. Now the shop is closed and I have no clue what is going on with my car. Completely unprofessional.

Edit: I am editing the review after speaking with with pep boys the next day. I still believe I should have received a call stating that my car would need to stay overnight. They did call me the next day and was able to fix my car correctly. Just know a 2 minute phone call can save you from bad reviews.

Edit2: So they said I could purchase the alternator online on their website and would get notified and pick it up and install it, that was at 12. At 3 I received a call stating they haven't received the info yet. They waited 3 hours to call me back to tell me they haven't seen my purchase. I should have been called back in like 20 min if they didn't get it. They wait 3 HOURS. Come on guys, CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

Edit3: So I it turns out even though it said I could pick it up right away it was out of stock. I was again told someone would call me with what would be done. It is now 6 they are closed and have not heard from anyone.

Edit4: They finally replaced the alternator, that part worked out. I went to pay and it should have been 150 for labor and 16 for diagnostics. They tried charging me 89 for something called cold crank which I have no clue what that is and didn't ask for it. They did take the charge off without dispute, but this tells me they are going to try you for every dollar you have. Save your money and go somewhere else. Also when I emailed the social email it took them 2 days to respond and said it would take 48 hours for them to investigate. By then my car is gone and I am done with them so that part is also lacking.</Text>

I use them for my oil change and basic car maintenance needs. They're booked out a week at my favorite location. It's worth making an appointment. The prices are surprisingly lower than most! My most recent trip was for 4 new tires.</review>

<Text>Don’t usually post reviews, but felt the need to warn any potential customers about the inconvenient and misleading staff here.

I had an emergency with my vehicle and was very glad that this location was one of the few shops to be open on a Sunday. After waiting 3 hrs with no other customers before me, I finally got a call from them informing that it was just a minor issue with my battery. Given that it was a Sunday and the staff anywhere are usually slim, I understood but couldn’t accept that a minor diagnosis took that long with no customers waiting before me. After receiving the diagnosis over the phone, I informed them that I was able to make the repair myself and that I was going to drop by to pick up my vehicle. Upon arrival, the shop closed early and they informed that all cash registers automatically locked down on its own, in which they couldn’t simply charge me the $15 diagnostic fee and couldn’t release my vehicle to me until 7am the next morning. They told me all of this while locked up in their shop instead of opening the door to clearly explain it all.

I am grateful that they were open on a Sunday, and the diagnostic fee wasn’t as pricey as most places are, but the inconvenience was not worth it all because I refused their service (which was a $204 battery replacement). I can’t speak about the rest of the staff, but be aware that two individuals there do not do well with customers.</Text>< UserId.>

We needed a new tire and no one in Taft had one. Was planning to go to Walmart but told us on the phone it was almost double what their website said so tried here and they were cheaper and the guy at the desk was super helpful and friendly. Amazing service.</Text>

Pay attention to their  5 star rating, they are all pretty generic, more than likely written by friends and family.

1) went in for front brakes and tires
Was Told me they couldn't turn my rotors due to "insert mumbo jumbo here" even through the rotors had tons of meat left on them.
Also got WRONG tires put on!
2) never received a call for when it was gonna be ready.
- so I called, was told 45 min
-called back an hour later,  immediate response , it will be ready in 45 min.
- had to inform the guy that's what I was told an hour ago, (great job updating the notes bud)
3) get told itll be ready in 15, get there and it is not ready, still on lift and needs a test drive
-when I get in car to leave there is grease all over my door
4) get home realize hey, my tires dot match, call and get the right tires ordered
5) never hear back from them and have to call again to see if tires came in
6) take car in at just after 8am, guy tries righting notes wrong on what tires to change and I corrwct him, then hear nothing till I call at 11:20
7) I get a call back cause they now see a mismatch of tires, and cannot read the MANAGER hand writing, (get a new manager).
8) finally explain to mechanic, you are replacing the tires that were not suppose to be put on, by your shop, a few days ago!

< Review>
In my experience with doing oil changes at different places, I can say Pep Boys is the best. They have good deals on oil changes and don't try to sell you other things (except windshield wipers.) Just make sure to look for a pep boys oil coupon online before paying. I know my car has a lot of problems, but they just take care of what I bring it in for. It's a big difference from the Jiffy Lube on Ashe and Ming, which gave me a story of how one of their employers messed up the oil pan gasket and how he didn't work there anymore so he couldn't be held accountable.  If you need a decent oil change do it here. You won't be disappointed.<//Review>

Terrible experience. I was told that car will be ready in 45 minutes, I came back to pick it up after two hours, and they haven't even touched it. They said it'll be next, so I left and came back after 2.5 hours and it still wasn't ready! Besides the fact that one of the services I requested wasn't done and I wasn't notified about it. Zero customer service skills. Not going there ever again!< /Text>

<text>I called this place to ask if i can walk in for an oil change right now, and the woman said yes. So i drove for 3 miles because the one closer to my house rejected me cuz they are fully booked today. I parked in front of the office. I saw two guys inside the office chilling, talking to each other, loving the A/C. I thought, this place is not busy at all. No one is working outside with the cars. So i talked to one of the guys and said that they couldnt take me in and if i want an appt tomorrow. I said i talked to the woman like 5 mins ago that you guys can do my oil change. He said, they have to finish one car and theres another one, blah blah blah. As if they were really busy chilling in the a/c. I said, can i talk to the woman i talked to on the phone. She came, and told me that she didnt know that the guys cant do it. I asked her, "so you told me to come without asking them if they can do it?". She said yes. I was like, wow. Just wow! I am so upset! They wasted my time for nothing. Never gonna do business to this place ever again.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1533693663149, 'text': 'We’re sorry you had a poor experience.

<Text>Literally the most unprofessional staff I've ever seen. So awkward and rude. When I was checking in they didn't even ask my my name. When something was wrong with my car after the guy I spoke with was very rude insisting it wasn't their fault and refusing to look at it. I will not be returning.</Text>< name>

I was looking locally for an oil change, the cheapest was $45-$55 for conventional oil, so I walked in to pepboys on white lane and I was shocked to hear their oil change cost $31.95+tax. They were full at the time, So I told them I'll come the next day. At night went to pepboys online and I found a coupon for $19.99+tax I said wow what a great deal.

I booked an appointment and went the next day, I got here 15 mins ahead of time, And I didn't see but a welcoming and nice gentleman greeting me and took care of me right away.

Honestly I never experienced anything but respectful and courteous customer service. They did the oil change and I left, My car runs as it should be, and I was grateful for this amazing price and great customer service. I saved at least $20-$30 and got a good oil.

This is my honest experience and my own review. Nobody asked me to do it online, Best thing after I received a rating for their service by email, I was awarded another coupon $19.99+tax coupon, I gave it to a friend of mine.

Thank you pepboys 😎<//text>

Should be zero stars. Worst customer service around. Made my car worse, didn't bother to apologize or acknowledge the mistake and refused to refund my money. Do not come here...do yourself the favor.<//text>

I used to visit this place heavily when I lived in Santa Clarita. Zach turned me into a cigar freak at the time. Zach has the best customer service and is very knowledgeable about all of his products, specifically his cigar inventory. I highly doubt that anyone will ever find an alternative for their cigar needs. I HIGHLY recommend them.<//review>

<review>I am no cigar expert, so I cannot comment on the variety they offer, however, I came in search of a good quality lighter. Not only did I leave with a great lighter, I also experienced customer service that was attentive to detail. I strongly recommend this place as small stores like these are becoming scarce.< /review>< GmapID>

<review>It is a small place with only 3 to 4 workers. As long as you are not in a rush then it is a great place to eat. Everything was prepared fantastically and had great flavor. If you want more to drink or need something else you will need to flag down the waiter, but that isn't a big deal in such a small place.<//review></record></dataset><record>

FOOD
The fish was very soft and fresh. All of it was super tasty and the chef took a lot of effort into plating it nicely.

SERVICE
Service could have been better, but it wasn't bad. My table had a comfortable amount of time to chat. Just get the waiter's attention and you're good to go.

AMBIANCE
When we went, there were only a couple of people in the restaurant, so it was nice and quiet. It's a bit small, but nice and bright.< /review>

Love this place! Saw it on check please. My sister moved to the city so I said let's try it . It's all of like 6 tables.OMG! We said just let the chef do his thing. He did! Every single bite was heaven! We each had our fabulous favorites but both agreed all were a piece of art and some of the highest quality of fish we'd ever had.lots of delicate herbs and edible flowers a little saffron on one of them. Fantastic just fantastic! $100 for lunch for two, but we didn't care, we felt it was worth it. I think they are a couple and she waited on us. She was just as good! She was fun and talked me into uni again. I had given it up for life.< /text>

Great little sushi spot. Never had a bad roll. The staff is very friendly and attentive. I have only been there weekdays and early on a Friday so my wife and I have never had to wait for seats.< /review>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>Getting sushi with a friend on a Friday night in SF can be a mission but this little gem right up the street made the whole process a breeze. My friend and I shared a small cold sake, large Sapporo, Tiger Roll (delicious avocado & shrimp) and Spicy Tuna. The service was quick and the bill was about 40 with tip. Great quick place to grab a bite before going out.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>Not an honest business, tech  did not know what to do with adjustment for the rear wheel. set it to make the machine happy but caused the axel to come out of the differential . Then when he test drove the car he burned the clutch. now they won't call back or claim to have caused it. Don't  use them.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDZhE5roTZ1Ij8GkFkdt4Xaqlwz927z3xSwDhF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Wow.... I’ve been to plenty of reputable shops before and have gotten charged a max of $130 for alignments but these guys are out to rip you off. These same guys even charged me $95 about a year ago and no they’re charging me 165 for an alignment which is far too much. I know these guys are “good” but you can also find another shop like Pacific Tire Outlet in Milpitas for half the price and just as good.</Text>

Just got my wheels aligned here. These guys know their job for sure. Highly recommend. The junior guy was more friendly and willing to explain what happens. They brought me to the car and answered all my questions. I will come here again next time.< /Text>

<review>Hit a curb, in order to go straight, steering wheel center need to be at 2:00 o' clock.  So the car needed an alignment or something costlier...
Aligntechs folks let me know base on the computer test result, bent/damaged components are possible (more cost to fix). However, upon visual inspection, no other issue was found - Al my car need was an alignment.
Bottom  line, friendly, honest and willingness to explaining all of the potential issue and cost.  Would 100% recommend them to anyone.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

The guys there a are pretty decent. Joey did a great job and was completely transparent about my wheel swap and tire mount.  However, they we're understaffed which really threw off the deliverables turn around time they gave me< /Text>

<text>I’ve taken many cars to these guys all modified with oversized tires, wheels and off sets, lowered and they always deliver.  Most recently they lowered my Jeep Grand Cherokee and think it was a bigger job than we all expected.  Again above and beyond and honored their quote which was very reasonable.< /text><resp>None</resp><username>Dave Immethun< /username></record></dataset><record>

Twice the dealership was unable to fix my 2013 Subaru from shaking after buying new tires. My appointment at Aligntechs, was on time, priced great, and problem fix! Very happy experience.  If you wait for your repair, bring a coat. No heat inside the shop.<//Review>

<Review>I have tried Official Lexus dealer , tried other shop to get vibration go away and put my wheel straight. Nobody was able!

Only Apigntechs has done amazing work in aligning and balancing all my wheels.

This is the place I will do my alignments and balancing always.<//Review>< user_id>

<text>Quick and efficient!  I came on a Friday morning shortly after the shop is open without any appointment.  Victor give me a quote and told me it will be about 45 minutes, even they were super busy.  Victor took the time go over the adjustments and make sure I didn't have any questions.

From the moment I gave them a call I felt the knowledge and great customer service magic of the back. Price $$$ is right and you don't leave feeling taken advantage of. Found my new shop for any work I may need in the future.< /review>

Junior the the technician I spoke to on the phone and when I got there he greeted me we had previously talked about the problem of me taking it to to previous shops that I will not mention but they are big chains he knew right away what the problem was he actually called me out to the garage and showed me what was causing the shaking in my vehicle and then I took the truck for a drive down the freeway and fantastic after all of that money I spent to get this problem resolved he took care of it right away I highly recommend the shop for any kind of alignment or shaking on your vehicle. Thanks Junior you Rocked 🙌</text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>3<//Rate><Review>Cycle Gear has a pretty good in store collection of motorcycling things. However, I was shopping for a specific items that showed as in-stock online, but wasn't there. I ordered the item from the store. It will be delivered in about a week. But, when I looked at the email confirmation of the order, my address was wrong. The clerk in the store didn't confirm what I had spoken, before submitting the order, leading to the discrepancy. Prices here are pretty much on par with other outlets and online retailers. I would have given more stars, but this isn't the first time I have had small issues with Cycle Gear. It's just annoying. I will continue to shop here for the selection and prices.< /Review>< Time>

Store was clean an well organized. It's one of the smaller Cycle Gear locations that I have visited, so the selection seemed to be somewhat limited, at least in terms of riding apperal. Went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. Staff was cordial and knowledgable.<//Review>

My husband , granddaughter and myself went to Cycle Gear for new motorcycle helmets. How fun! Our salesman Tim was very helpful, climbing up to the top shelves looking for the perfect size. "Thanks Tim". Cycle Gear is a great store, with great brands and selections. Funny and engaging service. Plus, It was nice to be out again in clean environments, it made us feel safe. Love our helmets! Thanks Cycle Gear!<//Review>

<review>This place is great! I called to confirm they had an item in stock and confirmed the sale price, when I get down there it turned out they did have the item (a smaller ramp on sale for $99) but before I even said anything the gentlemen who helped me said he’d give me the larger ramp (which is all the had left) because he misquoted me. Love companies like this.< /review><rate>5<//rate><Response>{'time': 1602505406723, 'text': 'Thanks for the love, Nicole! Glad we could help you get what you need!

She took it extra effort and time with our son.  Very nice person experienced rider you couldn't ask for better help and getting gear.  And essentially outfitted our son for what other shops would have charged this just for one jacket.<//review>< Pictures>

I've been to Cycle Gear's before, but this place was a lifesaver and the staff was superb. I ran my last tube flat about 50 miles away from this place and road slow down the highway to find them open on a holiday.  Everyone else was closed.  I walked in excited, told the employee my situation and they replaced my tube in less than half an hour. Let me use their tools and gave me great advice.  Thanks again.< /Review>

It's Cycle Gear, how can you go wrong. They had a great selection of gear, of all types. I was able to both get myself a nice summer jacket and replace my visor/side plates. I was most impressed that they had parts for my helmet. Being that it was 3 years old, and baught in a different state.< /Review>

<review>Worst retail store I have ever shopped in this location is constantly out of the most common things the shelf tags never match the product that has been stocked there. and when you tell someone that works there that the price is wrong they act like your a  Ahole for bringing it up. Also you can go in the next day and it is never fixed I will never shop at this location again I can get things faster through #rockymountainatv<//review>< pics>

<Text>Wide selection of gear- it is a well lit, clean store with fairly knowledgeable staff. I have been in there several times and usually don't get what I need- but they are always offering to order it for me. One of my pet peaves- anyone with a smart phone can order most anything these days, and usually cheaper! I am not the easiest person to please in most apparel stores due to being a bigger guy- but I would expect to find a helmet that fits with the selection they had. Overall a good place- 4 stars!<//Text><response>None< /response><Rate>4<//Rate><username>Matt C in Redding</username><gmapID>0x54d2ecbc2b902889:0x6d770434b400d4c0< /gmapID>< userid>

Absolutely think this store is awesome!  The selection of inventory is enough to give you plenty to choose from, and the quality is great. My wife bought me an helmet for father's day that wasn't my style so two months later I returned it with not hassle. They just asked me why I was returning it ( with a smile on his face) and that was all. I've since have many many trips to the place and continue to be happy.. Customer service there is so good.. I'm pleased<//Review>

<review>Knowledgeable staff. They really helped me purchase my new helmet and did not try to talk me into the most expensive one on the shelf. Good honest advise.< /review>< Pics>

Un-real service, they took care of my helmet problem, diagnosed the issue and replaced it all this in just a few minutes. One on one service, and friendly at 7 pm on a Friday! This is why I come to cycle gear.
Thank you !

<Review>Selection is somewhat limited within each category but they have tons of categories of gear. They carry a little of everything from road racing grips to two stroke oil. The biggest selection is off road tires. In general a good place to go for last minute parts at a reasonable price.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x54d2ecbc2b902889:0x6d770434b400d4c0<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Was on my way up to Oregon for a road trip. Had to stop for some supplies. Staff was really helpful and they had quite the inventory. Prices were solid, grabbed my stuff, and was on my way.</Review>

The staff are very helpful and friendly here.  I get the Cycle Gear magazine and check it for deals then go to this place to purchase.  I've bought helmets, gloves, shoes and a great anti-theft locking device which helps me feel better about some knucklehead stealing my moto.  Really glad they have a cycle gear in Redding!  Keep up the good work!  Cheers!!!<//Text>

<Text>Between the noise of tropical birds and the surf constantly making that irritating wave sound I could hardly think about my visit at all... I guess the highlight was the quaint straw hut with the grass roof, very picturesque. I like the way the drinks come with little umbrellas and the lady who gave me the flower necklace (she called it a lei?) was very kind. When I asked about volcano tours they seemed a little confused, but showed me how a map works (Up is north? What a weird world.) I was a little annoyed by all the people taking pictures all the time, but I guess it's a tourist destination. The staff are very helpful in my experience, but refusing my offer of a back massage seemed a little bit rude; I thought his shoulders looked tense, but he insisted those weren't his shoulders. I travel a lot, so I may be confusing this location with another one of the same name, but with that level of consistency across franchises you have to expect some of your employees will end up being fans of Minor Threat.</Text>< pictures>

We were on our way to cycle gear from klamath falls which is a little over 2 hours away, and got stuck in an accident on I5 for two hours. I called cycle gear to see if they'd stay open FIVE MINUTES late for us and they wouldn't. We pulled in at 7:06 and they were locked up and gone. Clearly don't care about your business so take it else where.</text>

Never bought shoes from Journeys. All I can say is the gentleman that assisted me today with my buy was a total sweetheart. I didn't get his name, but I believe he was a manager.. But he gave phenomenal customer service. Plus I earned extra money for simply subscribing to their website! How cool! I get updates on new trends and they award you with a coupon!! Thank you for the recommendation by the way. What more can  you ask for?! Right.
I will definitely be coming back for more Docs!!  God bless!</review>

<user>110831055075991656428<//user><Text>Today I was in the store. I saw a pregnant woman yelling & threatening an employee, who wasn't even a customer. The manager,  Jesse, didn't bother to stop the situation. He continued to let the woman yell & threatened the employee. What kind of manager allows that?!? You need to have better management that will stop situations like this! No employee deserves to be treated this way! I ended up not buying anything.<//Text><resp>None</resp><rating>1</rating><username>Diana Zamorano</username>< Gmap_id>

Today I went to Journeys with my Granddaughter.   The store ManagerJimmy he wore black glasses.   He asked me if I needed help.  I asked him do rhey carry the Harry Potter Vans.   From a distant he told me they were on the third shelf, than came over and pointed them out but never asked if I needed help .  I asked to speak to the srore Manager he said he was the Manager.  I told him that he needed a lot of training.   I told him you are supposed to greet your customers, and ask if they need help.  Jimmy asked like I was bothering him.  Corporate, please give your store manager additional training.  If was good, I should have left out buying at least three pair of shoes, sock, and shoe cleaner.  Jimmy made Journey loose money today.  I went next door to Shoe Palace customer service was outstanding.   My Granddaughter was happy to get three pair of shoes.  I don't spend my hard earned money with Companies that don't acknowledge their customers!</text>

I never write a review but I think it is important I do because of the  great experience I had at this location . I ordered shoes online and unfortunately FedEx was irresponsible and delivered the package in my backyard where I was unable to see it. I finally found the shoes weeks later only to find that my dog had completely torn them up. I was sad and FedEx said they couldn't do anything about it. Luckily the manager at this Journey's was amazing and replaced them for me! I know it was not Journey's fault but I was so grateful at the costumer service they provided. I never had this experience with any other shoe store. Thank you Journey's for thinking of your customers feelings and cleaning up the mess of FedEx lol! you have a guaranteed lifetime customer<//text>

<Text>I was looking for birkenstocks. I asked the sales associate for my size. He brings out my size, but there is only one shoe. He tells me to just take the one that is on display. The one on display was a completely different shade from all the dirt of other peoples feet. Then he says that it’s just because it was made differently. Very disappointed in this!!< /Text>< Pictures>

I used Montano orthodontist for my daughter a few years ago and her smile is beautiful. As an adult, I was Unsatisfied with my smile and decided to do something about it. There was no question where I’d be going. The staff are so professional and Dr. Montano and his team create the most beautiful smile in town!  The experience was wonderful and I’m more than satisfied with the results.< /Text>

<review>My 12-year-old daughter and I were both recently patients of Dr. Montano and Dr. Wright. I had a great experience using Invisalign, and my daughter just recently had her braces removed. We are both extremely pleased with our results, and can't speak highly enough of the friendly and professional staff. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the staff always took the time to answer our many questions and concerns. Would highly recommend Montano Orthodontics!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Best Orthodontics in Kern County! Every Orthodontic in town wasn’t able to help me because of my jaw etc. but Montano said it was no problem! I got my braces off yesterday and I am so happy with my results! Not only that, the staff is very nice and caring.</Review>

I’m still smiling and I’m not even the one who had their braces removed. I would like to share my experience with everyone and say that I am so happy that I chose Montano Ortho. My daughter went in for care and came out extremely happier as we seen amazing results. Apart from that they always helped me throughout any questions or times needed to maintain the best treatment for my child. He provides very professional care and uses the best advanced care out there. The environment provided there is beyond amazing. You will not be disappointed. They are very detailed with helping your child if you are going in for children. They make sure to explain step by step care for them and provide parent with useful information as well and always. I hope I can come back in and choose a treatment for myself. Thank you so much Dr. Montano!! My daughters smile transformation is incredible! 5 stars for sure!<//text>

Dr. Montano is seriously the best, he fixed all the mistakes the other orthodontics did to my teeth and bite and now I’m very satisfied with my smile thanks to his work.
The scheduling and appointments were smooth, I never had to wait long to be taken in and the staff was very friendly and professional. The place is very clean and well maintained.
I definitely recommend Dr. Montano!</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMC_s7abaCcHoEzVNcleJFXAFCqcV1nuSXIE_N2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

My son got his braces off today and we could not be more pleased! Dr. Montano and his staff have been awesome to work with over the last few years but even more so this last year during the pandemic. The office is always clean and has been updated with additional measures to protect all of the staff and patients.
Everyone in the office are very kind and always helpful.
I would highly recommend Montano Elevated Orthodontics to everyone!</Review>

<Review>I just got my braces of 1 1/2 years off today, and the experience was great. The office is always very clean and even specially decorated, as well as the very kind staff and Orthodontists. I personally started with crowding and crooked teeth, but now my teeth are straight and beautifully aligned. Montano Elevated Orthodontics is always honest and love their jobs, so have no reason to rush, or ask for unnecessary payments/steps, and it is the place to trust. I also happened to finish with my braces journey half a year early, although that is just my experience. I was also kindly offered a free teeth whitening just for writing this review. 😆 My appointments were always out in the open center of the office, not feeling embarrassing at all but actually less serious and “enclosed”. Surely recommend! Love my new smile! 😁</Review>< Pics>

Professional and courteous. Treatment was thoroughly explained at on-set and thereafter until treatment was completed. I could not have found a better orthodontist/office to take care of my son’s smile.<//Text>

I was doing a lot of research where to get my braces from and my coworker recommended I go see Mr. Montano. After getting my consultation and speaking to him I thought it was the best choice to get my braces with him. I got Invisalign instead of the traditional braces and after 14 months I can finally feel great about my smile. I thought the employers were very professional and friendly which made it very comfortable. I truly felt valued by them and they addressed any concerns or questions I had. I would highly recommend.</text>

<review>Since dr cardell has left this place has not been the same. The doctor now needs assistance since he’s always busy and the wait time to see him is about 2-3 months. He often is out of the office, which means the entire office shuts down and no one receives work. I need to get out of my retainers so i can get additional work down like my crowns, bleaching etc but can’t since the wait currently is 2-3 months. I don’t understand why we have to wait so long. Maybe take less customers if you can’t handle the demand. Also be prepared if you’re even 10 minutes late, they will reschedule you 2 months out. Where is the customer service in that?! This has been an ongoing concern of mine. Also when doctor is out of office which is often, so is the office manager. Shouldn’t the office manager be present to assist with other matters? Why is a free get out of work card for everyone. I just don’t understand how this is a reflection of 5 star service and or treatment. Hopefully this concern brings up some policy changes.</review><date>1622572700368</date>< Response>

We have just completed orthodontic treatment for FOUR children with Montano Elevated Orthodontics! My first two children had quite crooked teeth and spent several years each in braces. My next two had less crooked teeth and they were each in braces for just under two years. The staff is always friendly and helpful, and I was confident that my kids were receiving good care. They are all satisfied with their smiles! I would really, REALLY recommend wearing the given retainer every single night. My oldest child lost his and has never gotten it replaced, and his teeth have shifted quite a bit. It really makes a difference!< /text>

<review>Incredible results! I was highly skeptical that my teenage sons teeth could be straightened with 2 years of Invisalign. Unbelievable that they are flawlessly straight, perfect, like a miracle and our treatment even finished early! This office offers top notch, state of the art professionalism with life changing effects! Each appointment they had his package of Invisalign’s  ready to go, in order and organized! I never had to monitor him once and he was only 13 at the time.  Everything you need and nothing is impossible here!! Minimal office visits, convenient and short appointments, extremely organized, friendly staff. Highest recommendation!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I had an excellent experience getting Invisalign treatment with Dr. Montano! He and his team have been extremely patient with me and never stopped encouraging me to get back on track when I fell behind. I especially appreciate the attentiveness they take to ensure patients' needs are met. Thank you for helping me enhance my smile! 😁< /text>

I had my braces on for 7 years when I was a child and Dr. Montano had been my orthodontist. I had a giant gap and needed quite a bit of work to fix my teeth. Unfortunately a few years ago my dog chewed up my retainer and I never got a new one. Over the last year I began to notice I was getting a gap in my front teeth and also had some spacing that I was unhappy with. I decided to go back to Montano Elevated Orthodontics and I’m so happy I did. It’s amazing the new technology they have compared to when I was kid. It was an easy process and I am so happy with how my smile turned out. I would highly recommend Montano Elevated Orthodontics for both children and adults.<//text>

Finally after many years with braces I got them off! I wanted to get braces because I was always nervous about my teeth. I didn’t think my smile was really pretty. But after I got them off I can’t stop smiling. I feel so pretty and happy. I decided to chose Dr Montano because I heard many good things about him and I trusted the reviews. I am very glad I did! The team and staff there were always so kind and I always felt comfortable there. Never once did I felt like an odd one out. They were extremely professional. Once you start going to this orthodontist you will be happy you didn’t choose another! My advice to others is make sure to wear your rubber bands and brush your teeth everyday. Also don’t be afraid of getting them. After you get them off, you will always feel good about your smile!<//review>

Since day one, the staff treated me like family making sure my visits felt comfortable and special. Every appointment was centered on me reaching the smile of my dreams,  and with qualified and amazing staff this goal was not only reached, but greatly accomplished. I appreciate every team member and staff that made my process a smooth and successful one. I now love my smile, and can smile confidently knowing I got the best care in all of Kern County!</review>

<text>Today after 38 months of treatment I finally got my braces off. I am beyond grateful with the staff and Dr. Montano who made my smile possible. My biggest insecurity growing up was my smile. After a routine cleaning with my Dentist she referred me to Dr. Montano. I live in Wasco, Ca so it was a 35 min drive but well worth it these past 3 years. My experience with them has been one of the best. The staff are so friendly and make you feel comfortable and welcomed. I'm a 26 year old who is rocking her smile, I feel so confident and cant stop smiling.<//text>< pics>

<text>I definitely regret not taking all of my children to Dr. Montano. I recently had my braces taken off and am so extatic with my beautiful smile. The results are amazing!!! My son started his treatment with another office and unfortunately, it was a very bad experience. After removing several teeth, we were told he needed additional teeth removed and that's where I turned to Montano. They did an incredible job and no additional teeth were removed. The staff is amazing and the doctors are very knowledgeable and walk you through every step of your journey. I definitely recommend him to everyone and will soon be taking my other children to start their treatment.< /text>< Pics>

I pursued orthodontic treatment because I didn't like my smile. My teeth were crooked and bite was uneven. I chose Dr. Montano because of the good things I've heard through friends. I just got my braces taken off and I am extremely happy with the results! Their staff is so welcoming and makes sure their patient knows they are in good hands. I highly recommend coming to this orthodontist if you want your confidence in your smile back.</review>

<Text>Before I started my treatment, I was looking for traditional braces only. Once visiting Montano, I soon discovered that I could also get Invisalign, an option perfect for me! I do not regret getting my treatment here whatsoever! From the staff to Dr. Montano himself, everyone made me feel at home, and were all so incredibly kind. If anyone is looking for an orthodontist, Montano is the way to go! I don’t have a single regret!</Text>< user_id>

I have two kids being treated by Dr. Montano. The staff is great and friendly. Dr. Montano is a great down to earth guy that takes his time to answer all our questions. The kids feel safe going there. I recommend him and his staff to everyone who asks about braces.</review>

< Review>
I came to Dr Montano for braces as a child. The experience was so great that 20 years later, I came back with my own child. He went through 2 and a half years with braces and in that time, I have ZERO complaints. He had a few things unexpected come up along the way (pokey wire, loose bracket) and I was always able to get him in same day for a quick repair. Dr Montano and Cardall all both amazing and their staff is just as good. I am so happy I went with them for my sons braces. Should any orthodontic needs ever come up again, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Highly, highly, highly recommend. Affordable, respectable, professional, knowledgeable, friendly and caring...they really are all of those things. Thank you Dr Montano!!!! We are forever grateful for the beautiful smiles you have created!< /Review>

So my parents brother me to Montano Orthodontist. To help me fix my smile. Because I had crooked teeth and it was effecting my smile. My sister got her braces from Montano. So I decided to go to Montano because it was close and they took good care of my teeth. Now that I have gotten my braces off I am so happy with my smile. I am so happy that I went to Montano they were all ways making sure that I was alright with my braces. You should get a water pick it helps a ton. Especially when you have food stuck in your braces.<//Text>

<review>Dr. Montano was my orthodontist 20 years ago and it was a wonderful experience. So I knew I wanted to take my daughter there when it came time for her braces. She got them off this week and we are thrilled with the results of all the hard work from your professional staff.

<Review>My daughter wanted straighter teeth because she thought it wasn't symmetrical enough. She wasn't happy with her teeth and was always self conscious. We researched several orthodontists and decided that Montano elevated orthodontics was the best fit for us in terms of experience and cost.

She is more confident and is constantly smiling. She was treated with respect and kindness every time she went in. If you need an orthodontist Montano elevated orthodontics is a great choice.< /Review>< gmap_id>

We are from out of town and my son has braces unfortunately his bracket became loose and I couldn't find an orthodontics that could clip his bracket. I called Montano orthodontics and the receptionist Sarah was so polite and got me an appointment the same day. I really appreciate it. Melinda was so nice she clipped the bracket and made sure this bracket didn't poke him. This is a great orthodontics Thank you<//text>

<review>I had a great experience with Dr. Montano,  and his office staff.  I have been going for over two years, and I was very pleased with the out come.  My experience was more to correct my jaw and I'm now looking lovely.  My smile is beautiful and my jaw problem has been corrected.  Everyone is so helpful and they take their time with you.  I would like to thank Dr. Montano, and his staff for dealing with me because i have a mouth on me and they worked with me.  Thank you all for a great experience and I will  other family and friends to you.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWh8hpdCPBN17QEONRgAzJjHB_6NR71ZpK1vdF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

After 51 years of living with crooked teeth, my employer added adult ortho to our dental plan and it was time to correct. I was referred by my dentist to Montano Elevated Orthodontics. I am so glad they did. I never realized before the correction just HOW crooked and how much my teeth affected my appearance. After living with it all of my life I guess I just became accustomed to them. The office explained that they offered Invisaline at the same cost as traditional braces because they have so many patients and they pass their discount on to their clients. They also offer a convenient payment plan that worked for me. From the initial visit, to dealing with the front office staff, to my check-up appointments (which were spread out every several months, not every month) I found Montano's to be helpful, convenient, and perfectionists. My correction took 16 months. Much shorter than I would have anticipated. I highly recommend Montano's to ANYONE considering teeth straightening procedures. They are the best!< /Text>

The reason why I pursued orthodontic treatment was to fix my smile. Before I got my braces I never use to smile with my teeth and now I can't stop smiling and showing off my awesome new smile. The team here at Montano are really good. They answered all my questions that I had during my appointments and really easy staff to talk to. All around good place and don't regret getting my treatment here at all.</Text>

<review>My teeth were headed West before I went to Dr. Montano!  They really were.  ~ Dr Montano was recommended by my regular dentist and I’m so glad I choose him as my Orthodontist. He is very knowledgeable and skilled. Besides having an office that has every new technology for straightening teeth, he also has created a very positive and fun atmosphere for his patients and staff. His staff are very nice, but also professional. They really seem to stay on schedule. When I checked in, I was practically called back immediately!! I appreciated that, but more than that I always felt assured that my treatments were going well. Now, my bite is correct and my teeth are straight!! Thank you Dr Montano for your great sense of humor and a big thank you for my -now- beautiful smile !!<//review>< Pictures>

Being super nervous and not knowing what questions to ask or even walking in I did not know what to expect, but with Montana’s team made it easy for me and they were through with me about what the upcoming months would entitle with them. They were very flexible especially since I needed to finished in a specific time frame and they were able to make that happen for me with no worry.

I pursued orthodontic treatment for my overbite and uneven teeth. Before I came to Montano I would never smile with my teeth while taking pictures because of my teeth. My mom decided it was time to go to Dr. Montano, and I wouldn’t regret any second of it! Everyone there made me feel so comfortable and they are just the sweetest people ever! Now I feel really confident about my teeth and it feels good to have so many people comment on your beautiful smile! I really recommend Montano Elevated Orthodontics. I love my smile!<//Review>

I decided to go see Dr. Montano and I am so very glad I did.

I have had nothing short of the very best service from everyone in the office!

On December 18th, 2019, my braces were removed and I have been celebrating ever since!

I am so jazzed, I can’t stop smiling!

My teeth look better than I ever could have imagined, and I feel like a brand new person!

I have had the best time, and I am going to miss these wonderful people that have been so awesome!

Dr. Montano has been phenomenal in making my teeth look so fabulous and Virginia has been my girl from A-Z.

I have been able to have so much fun in the office and everyone has made me feel like part of the family.

< Review>
I absolutely love Montano Elevated Orthodontics!! I wanted to fix my teeth and my bite and I was skeptical that I would be able to, but Dr. Montano reassured me everything would turn out perfectly. I decided to give it a try and I am beyond happy with my results. I was told that I would more than likely have to wear my Invisalign for 2 years, but it’s only been about 16 months and I finished as if today!  The staff was great and always very professional. Dr. Montano is very knowledgeable and was always very pleasant during my appointment! The office is beautiful and inviting. They worked with me and was able to give me a monthly payment that I was comfortable with and I haven’t had any regrets!!! Thank you Dr. Montano and staff for making me feel good about my smile again!!!< /Review>

In all honesty  I was very satisfied with the service I received. For every appointment I had not once did I wait more than 15 mins. As of today My braces were removed and I could not be anymore happy then I am today with my smile. They did such an amazing job with me that I was able to get my braces removed before my actual date.<//review>

I got my braces on about 2 years ago and before I got them, my teeth were really crooked, I had a huge over bite, and my teeth were so bad overall. I grew tired of the way my teeth were, so I decided it was time for a change. Before my treatment, I felt really self-conscious about my smile/teeth and I would feel embarrassed when I would talk to people. I rarely liked to smile and my confidence was very low. After I decided it was time to fix my smile/teeth, I was searching for options until I came across Dr. Montano. As I was doing more research about his treatments, I  decided to go with him because the prices were affordable, I got many benefits, and him and his team were always very caring/gentle with my case. Now that my braces are gone, I feel like I can be able to smile more and talk to people without having to feel embarrassed or self-conscious. I don't have to worry about my teeth anymore because I have enough confidence to smile. I am in love with my teeth/smile now! My experience with Dr. Montano's team was absolutely enjoyable because they made the environment feel really friendly and they were always super careful, caring, and gentle when it came to my appointments. If anyone out there is thinking about getting braces, then I totally recommend you go to Dr. Montano simply because him and his team are the best! You won't regret it and you will be happy/amazed with the results!</text>

Dr. Montano and his staff were always friendly throughout my treatment here. The facility is very inviting and clean. I don't know if many people can say this about getting orthodontic treatment, but, it was a very pleasant experience for me. They get a solid 5 stars!! Helpful, understanding and an overall fantastic place to come get your teeth fixed.< /Text>

My son had large gaps between his teeth, once our pediatric dentist said he was ready for braces we started looking for an orthodontist.  After searching we found
Monano to be the best. The staff were very nice to us. They fixed his gaps and made him a new smile that hes excited to show off. We couldn't of been any more happier.<//Text>

I used to have really crooked teeth but after my two phases of braces my smile is perfect and straight!  Everybody was always really nice and they were fast with the appointments.  They were always enthusiastic about everything and they made it fun.  It was definitely not as scary as I thought it was going to be!</Review>

Took my daughter here and had a great experience. Treatment took a few more months than projected but it was worth it! She had a tooth coming in between the wrong teeth and they moved it over to the correct place quickly. Her teeth look so beautiful now and she is beyond happy to show off her beaming smile without fearing judgment or being made fun of.< /Review>

Might be the best office ever! Staff has always been very welcoming and pleasant. My son has seen both doctors and he has liked each one. He just got his braces off and his teeth are beautiful. If you have an issue with your braces the staff really gets you in quick. Give them a try.< /Text>

Before going to Montano, I was pretty insecure about my smile and I wanted to change that. My mom and I looked at many offices but in the end I chose this one, and I am so glad I did. It was definitely the best fit for me, I wouldn't have wanted to go through this process any other way. The environment put me at ease and the staff was always so welcoming and friendly.  After almost three years of having my braces on, I am thankful to say that I am happy with my smile! I definitely recommend going to Montano Elevated Orthodontics.< /Review>

As an adult I always hated my teeth and wanted a pretty smile. I finally went in search of someone to fix them. I had no idea that who  I was recommended was not an orthodontist and wasted a lot of money and years and had to do them all over again this time I researched the best and found Dr Montano! He is phenomenal at what he does he is educated and knows his craft he has changed my life forever!! I now have a beautiful smile and given me confidence I never had before. I would recommend him to anyone that needs a knowledgeable orthodontist. He  meticulous and wants perfection I respect that so much.< /Text>

<Review>I pursued orthodontic treatment after I was in my 40’s  as I was experiencing much crowding which was hindering proper oral hygiene. My teeth before treatment were difficult to clean which could have lead to serious oral problems and disease. I was referred to by Dentist who felt I was a good candidate for Invisalign. I love my smile now but much more importantly my teeth are so much easier to clean. The Montano Team are all super nice and friendly. Advice: I’m not going to lie, you will experience some pain and discomfort from time to time. Avoid as much as possible not to touch the attachments or edges of trays with tongue as this will cause much pain. Be faithful to keep the trays in as much as possible, why prolong the pain. I felt orthodontic treatment was worth the cost and I would recommend  Montano Elevated Orthodontic.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><Rate>5</Rate><username>Sovie Cruz<//username>< Pictures>

I decided to get orthodontic treatment because I was very self conscious about my teeth. My teeth were not in good shape and I did not like to show my teeth. I was tired of hiding my smile from everyone so I talked to my parents about getting braces. The first place we went was Montano Elevated Orthodontics and we instantly knew we didn’t need to go anywhere else. The staff was super friendly and the overall environment was very welcoming. I was beyond excited to get braces because I knew I would finally get the smile I had been waiting for. I was excited for every orthodontist appointment because it was one step closer to having a beautiful smile. I had braces for 2 years and actually just got them off. I am so happy about the way my smile turned out and I couldn’t be more grateful for everyone at Montano Elevated Orthodontics. My advice for others is to go to Montano Elevated Orthodontics when thinking about getting braces because they truly are the best at creating Bakersfields most beautiful smiles. :)</text>

I loved this place, I had such a great experience with staff and dr. I got my braces back in 2016 and I just got them removed in 2019 and I couldn’t be more happy with my results. Definitely recommend 10/10. Best advice I can give is : always remember to put your bands on and to floss !</Review>

The office staff was wonderful, wait time was never long, everything was explained up front so there were never any surprises! I absolutely recommend Dr. Montano and even though we’ve moved to LA they were always more than helpful with appointment times that worked with the two hour commute for appointments. Never a single issue and there’s even Keurig delicious coffee while you wait!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

The staff is great, and both Dr Montano and Dr Cardall are kind and very knowledgable. My daughter has always hated her smile, and her teeth were a challenge to fix. She just got her braces off yesterday and she finally feels pretty and confident. Montano and Cardall did an amazing job and continue to provide great service now that her braces are off. Definitely recommend!<//text>

We had a great experience here with the whole staff. My nephew, Jesus needed braces as he was not happy with his smile and they were not straight. He is ecstatic with the results and will be starting high school next year. We chose Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall because we wanted him to have the best and we knew with quality doctors we wouldn’t be disappointed. He just got his braces off and his teeth look amazing. We couldn’t be happier with the results and we highly recommend these specialists.</Review>

We decided to take my daughter to Dr Montano & Cardall after learning she needed extensive work. My husbands sister had gone to him as a child & was very pleased with the work so we thought it would be in our best interest to have our daughter be seen by Dr. Montano. From the first visit to the very last and every one in between we were pleased and always had the assurance that we were in great hands. The staff & doctors are great & very knowledgeable in the most up to date orthodontic treatment. We love her results! Thank you Dr. Montano & Cardall! :)</Text>

<text>My experience with Dr. Montano Dr. Cardall and their staff has been amazing. From day one they all have been positive, encouraging, and remained patient and helpful through out my care. Their office is very welcoming and doesn't have your typical orthodontics environment. One of the many benefits of this office is that you could get a second opinion within the minute, seeing as their are two specialists working in the same place. If you are at all interested in getting braces I 100% recommend going to Montano & Cardall.<//text>< Resp>

Best experience ever.  This was actually my second time having braces.  Let's say the first time was over 10 years ago, before I had my wisdom teeth removed through a not so great office.  Going through Montano & Cardall Orthodontics was a pleasant surprise.  Easy to schedule appointments, didn't have to wait more than 5 or 10 minutes before being called back to be seen.  The application of the braces themselves was amazing compared to what I had experienced elsewhere before, as well as the removal.  The staff is amazing and actually try to ensure you are comfortable and explain exactly what is going on.  I would like to thank all the staff at Montano & Cardall for my new smile.<//Review>

<review>I needed orthodontic treatment because my teeth, like many people, were really crooked. I did not like my smile at all, and I always closed my mouth when I smiled. We chose Montano and Cardall due to the great reviews and feedback given to us my friends. The staff over there is extremely courteous and friendly to us as patients, and because of Montano and Cardall themselves, I got my braces off earlier than anticipated. So now, my teeth are straighter than a steel beam. I now feel confident with the way I smile. We will highly recommend Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to anyone who needs orthodontic treatment due to there unbeatable service!</review>< Gmap_id>

Montano and cardall is hands down the best orthodontist in town! The doctors and staff there are incredibly nice and talented. Every appointment was always nice and easy going. I started treatment 2 years ago, before braces I was always insecure about my teeth and couldn’t wait to get my braces on. I’m so lucky to have heard about montano and cardall I couldn’t be any happier with my finished results! I love my smile and can not stop smiling. My experience there was great ❤️<//review>

My son had his braces taken off today, and his smile is amazing.  Our experience with this great group of people was fabulous.  We were always treated so well, we never waited very long, and the results are in my son’s beautiful smile.  My husband went to Dr. Montano, and we wouldn’t have taken our son anywhere else.  Great experience from start to finish!  Thanks so much!!!<//text>

After being told that he needed to have three teeth extracted, I brought my son to Montano and Card Orthodontics. From day one, everyone was extremely kind and helpful. They explained the process very clearly, and we always felt very comfortable. Three years later, my son has a beautiful smile and no teeth had to be extracted. We are very grateful to the entire team.<//review>

<text>Dr Montano has surpassed our expectations. Our son went from having severe overcrowding and a tooth that wouldn’t come down. Within a few weeks, his teeth look so much better. It’s amazing how fast it all happened. My son is now in high school and excited to have his new amazing smile for display. The service and staff was above and beyond. I’m glad we made the choice to have Dr Montano is our orthodontist.< /text><Time>1558041212643</Time><user_id>100620395647963253862< /user_id><GmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377<//GmapID>< Resp>

After coming home 6 months ago from over seas and having braces put on over there, I need a specialist who was willing to continue work on my teeth. I called so many different orthodontist in Bakersfield and no one was willing to work on another doctors work, but the one phone call to Montano & Cardall they were more than happy to give me a consultation in the same week and take a look at my teeth. The moment I walked in to their office I was honestly so amazed at how beautiful and so nice everyone was there. I mean there really is a reason why it’s been rated the best in Kern County for so many years now. They were able to help me transform my smile in a matter of five months. I got them off today and I really can’t be any more happier at my results. They truly care for their patient< /Text>

<Review>We pursued treated me for my daughter as recommended by her dentist. We had two places in mind but as soon as we set foot in Dr. Montano's office we felt at home. The staff is so welcoming and explained everything so well. My daughter wasn't sure about getting braces but she did hate that her top teeth weren't so perfect. They made her feel so comfortable and took the time to explain the next steps in her treatment each visit. Since getting her braces off she can't stop smiling!  I would definitely recommend Montano Elevated Orthodontics to anyone. They are the best in town. We wouldn't go anywhere else!< /Review></record>

My oldest child just finished almost three years of treating overcrowding and a narrow jaw. We were referred to Montano by our dentist. Once we began treatment, the office was always welcoming and friendly. Every appointment’s goal was discussed and assessed. The wait was never long, and the timeline for completion of treatment was spot-on. My daughter was very responsible about taking care of her braces. Our other two children have also been referred and examined. They are being monitored to evaluate natural changes instead of rushing in to treatment. We look forward to working with Dr. Montano again when the time comes.<//review>

<Review>I was one of those kids who had braces as a child (TWICE!) but, to the dismay of my parents, never wore my retainers… I sought out Dr. Montano for my third round of treatment since my previous orthodontist had retired. From the start of my treatment, I have been embraced as a member of the family at Montano Elevated Orthodontics. My concerns were addressed with careful attention and I always came away from my appointments feeling thoroughly informed. The team is so genuinely welcoming and Dr. Montano is truly one of the kindest individuals you will ever meet. I felt extremely confident and comfortable with my overall experience; I would highly recommend them to anyone seeking quality orthodontic treatment!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are the best! Everyone in my family has been treated by them and are very happy with the results. Dr. Montano is great at explaining his treatment plan at every single visit. The staff are very helpful and professional. Every single person I have encountered at their office has been extremely kind and willing to do his best to accommodate your needs. They also send multiple reminds prior to your appointment, which is very helpful. I highly recommend coming here for any of your orthodontic needs!</Review>

<Review>Our teenage daughter needed braces and it just so happened that my sister had just had hers removed. She mentioned how much she liked Montano & Cardall. We called to make an appointment and they were very quick at setting up our appt and getting my daughter seen. Everyone there was so friendly and it was an atmosphere that was so pleasant to be in. Everyone smiling and just so happy. They also play great music. As for my daughter's braces and her appointments everything went well. They explained everything and also let us know when they were most busy and when it was best to make appointments especially if I needed to be in and out fast. My daughter just had them removed yesterday and she was so excited and anxious to see her perfect smile. I'd like to thank Montano & Cardall and their awesome staff for their amazing work and dedication to making all those beautiful smiles. 😁👏👍🤗</Review>< Rate>

I came to Montano Orthodontics and do not regret any part of it. My experience overall was great. Dr. Montano along with all the staff were absolutely amazing, kind, and always eager to help in a positive manner. I would refer this orthodontic to anyone and everyone. The inside office itself is eye candy due to the spacious lounge and beautiful canvas images posted along with former patient’s smiles.</review>

My daughter received orthodontic treatment from Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists through the Smile For A Lifetime Foundation. She was really lacking the confidence she needed because of her teeth. We went in not really sure what to expect. But now coming out, our expectations have been surpassed! Not only did they address the issues with her teeth, but they really took into account the whole structure of her face. This was the first time we had encountered such care and concern for a patient. Most orthodontists just want to fix the teeth. It has been nearly 3 years since my daughter first got her braces on, but the transformation is AMAZING! She has so much more confidence now and I find her smiling more often than not. Overall, working with the Montano & Cardall team has been a wonderful experience. I highly recommend them.< /text>

<text>I definitely enjoyed my time being while it lasted. Two and half years of having braces went by so fast that I wished it didn't last because I love everything about that place. First of all, the staff's are so nice and friendly. Once you walk in, they welcome you with their smiles, making you feel comfortable. Second of all, all the assistants are so cool! They're always so happy and joyful and they're easy to talk to! Lastly, Doctor Montano and Cardall are awesome! They know exactly what to do with your teeth because mine came out just beautiful! :) I just want to thank everyone who worked there for what they do because without them, I wouldn't have a great experience.<//text>< resp>

After coming home 6 months ago from over seas and having braces put on over there, I need a specialist who was willing to continue work on my teeth. I called so many different orthodontist in Bakersfield and no one was willing to work on another doctors work, but the one phone call to Montano & Cardall they were more than happy to give me a consultation in the same week and take a look at my teeth. The moment I walked in to their office I was honestly so amazed at how beautiful and so nice everyone was there. I mean there really is a reason why it’s been rated the best in Kern County for so many years now. They were able to help me transform my smile in a matter of five months. I got them off today and I really can’t be any more happier at my results. They truly care for their patient< /Text>

Both my husband and daughter recently completed orthodontic services with Dr. Montano. My husband did Invisalign while my daughter did traditional braces.  Dr. Montano and his staff are excellent.  You are seen promptly at your appointment time which is wonderful when pulling a child from school midday.  Both the Invisalign and braces were completed on time with wonderful results.  Highly recommend.< /text>

Before I received treatment from Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall, I had an overbite, some teeth that were almost completely sideways, and a huge gap in between my front teeth.  I was always fine with my smile, until the opportunity arose to improve it.  My dentist had said that braces would be a possibility for me, and we began to search.  We came across Montano and Cardall, and had heard from others that they would be a good choice.  I am so happy we chose them!  Everyone there is so friendly and understanding.  Plus - no needles!  Now that I have no overbite, no sideways teeth, and no gaps, I'm constantly smiling! I feel even more confident than I had before.  The pain and cost was absolutely worth these dazzling pearly whites.</Text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I had a severe overbite. My bottom teeth would dig into the roof of my mouth while I slept so I decided to get braces to help correct the problem. My dentist recommend Dr Montano and Dr Cardall.  After the consultation I decided I liked the treatment plan they came up with.
After 19 months, my braces are off and teeth feel great and look great. This was the best decision I could have made for teeth. The office staff and Drs are wonderful and very friendly. They worked around my schedule did their best to always fit me in immediately for emergencies, yes broken brackets happen!
I would recommend Montano and Cardall to friends and family.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Dr. Montano and his staff were very friendly and professional during the year I had Invisalign due to a gum recession.  Within a year, my teeth were perfectly straight and my gum recession improved.  The staff took time with me from the first consultation to the very last appointment.  The office is also very clean.

Who knew that at age 65 I would need braces, but my teeth shifted and there I was needing an orthodontist.  I had taken my children to an orthodontist many years ago and it was not a pleasant experience. I was not looking forward to getting braces.

Fortunately my dentist referred me to Montano & Cardall. What I was not looking forward to turned out to be a good experience, well as good as going to a dentist can be.

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are wonderful. They are knowledgeable and explained everything, plus they are very nice. That is a hard combination to find. I found out that I could get Invisaligns, that was a good choice, they were easy to wear and people couldn’t tell I was wearing them.

The staff at Montano & Cardall are nice, friendly, and very helpful.

Tho office is beautiful and clean. Both children and adults are comfortable in the office environment.

The appointments ran right on time so there is very little wait time.

< Review>
7/15/2020 - I just got my BRACES OFF TODAY!!! YASSSS!!! I am so HAPPPPPPY I can cry tears of JOY! It is definitely LIFE CHANGING!!!

First and foremost, I have been wanting to fix my under bite for as long as I can remember. Growing up I have always hated my smile..Every office I went to since I was a teenager (I am 29 now) have said I needed to get jaw surgery or get camouflage braces. I did not like that idea and knew that there was something out there for me.

I have been doing a lot of research for years and found that Dr. Montano does MEAW (Multiloop Edgewise Archwire) Technique for braces. This technique eliminates getting jaw surgery!

Please keep in mind that I am from Fresno, CA. I drive almost 2 hours every other month to Bakersfield for my braces. Talk about dedication lol.

I decided to choose Dr. Montano because there are not too many Orthodontist who perform the MEAW technique. I am lucky to have found Montano's office.

Overall, my experience with the team have been amazing! I love my NEW SMILE and I can't stop SMILING!!! I am grinning from ear to ear!

I would DEFINITELY recommend Montano Elevated Orthodontics for all of your orthodontic needs!

xoxo!<//Review>

<Review>We decided to take my daughter to Dr Montano & Cardall after learning she needed extensive work. My husbands sister had gone to him as a child & was very pleased with the work so we thought it would be in our best interest to have our daughter be seen by Dr. Montano. From the first visit to the very last and every one in between we were pleased and always had the assurance that we were in great hands. The staff & doctors are great & very knowledgeable in the most up to date orthodontic treatment. We love her results! Thank you Dr. Montano & Cardall! :)</Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Montana and Dr.Cardall are truly the best in Kern County. The took what was nearly impossible and made it happen, they were able to fix my smile. Their level of expertise is incredible. Have two specialists makes a difference, you are able to get a second opinion from either of the doctors. The staff is absolutely amazing, they are all very nice and caring, truly the best I have ever been pleased with meeting. If you are looking for an orthodontist, then this is the go to place. I highly recommend Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists, they can make anything happen.< /Text>

In my late 30s I found that my teeth/bite had shifted. I had braces as a teenager, but abandoned my good retainer-wearing habits after a couple years post-braces. I didn’t really notice things were moving in my mouth until I started to chip a few teeth and the pronounced gap between my top two middle teeth had begun to re-emerge. My dentist identified my regressing bite as corresponding to the issues I was experiencing and recommended Invisalign so as to preserve the integrity of my teeth as I continue to age. I was extremely pleased with the professionalism and efficiency of Dr. Montano and his staff. I never waited long for appointments and often finished quicker than I anticipated. While the duration of my treatment was longer than originally anticipated by a couple months, I felt assured knowing short cuts were not being taken and that my happiness with the outcome of my teeth was paramount. I wouldn’t hesitate entrusting Montano’s team with your pearly whites, regardless of your individual circumstances/concerns.</review>

Him and his staff where so welcoming to us the second we walked in there and the environment was one of the best we had experience. My daughter hated her teeth and started developing TMJ from her jaw being so off. Well after 26 months of treatment she got them off and she can not stop smiling which she said she was not going to smile because she loved her braces. Her experience with this office was one of the best, they truly take pride I n there work and want there patients to be comfortable at all time. If you are doubting yourself about getting braces or of a place I would say come to Montano Elevated Orthodontics as your first choice and you will not regret it!!!!<//Review>< pics>

My experience at Montano and Cardall was amazing. The staff area always welcoming and easy going. The atmosphere is always positive. The facility itself is also awesome. The best part was that my treatment finished in accordance to their timeline. Making appointments is also easy, and bracket crisis are always managed with a decent amount of time. They also accommodate payments, which makes the experience even better. Over all, I would definitely recommend this office to everyone!!!</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>When I first wanted braces, my dentist informed me I would need surgical braces due to the type of bite I had. ( malocclusion class III) When I was referred to Montano orthodontics, it was the best decision I ever made. I was always self conscious and hated smiling because of how my smile looked. Montano orthodontics was there for me every step of the way. From, first getting my braces, to getting me ready for surgery and my post op. I am very satisfied with how my smile looks, the staff was always able to help me with any questions I had and able to fit me in when a bracket came off. I would definitely recommend them if you are thinking about getting braces, the staff is amazing, very welcoming and the orthodontists are the best.</Text>< Pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>Our experience with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall was Awesome!!!  Both Dr.'s are super nice and really care about your child's outcome.  The whole staff is nice!  The office is nice and comfortable and cheerful and you can see your child while they are getting there treatment.  Their equipment and treatment is state of the art.  My daughter only had to wear her braces for 18 months and never even broke a bracket.  My older daughter went to an older orthodontist that didn't really keep up to date on the newest stuff and she wore her braces for 4 years and was constantly braking brackets.  The price was comparable and 100% worth it.  And...her teeth look absolutely beautiful!!!    Thanks Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall!!     I will definitely be recommending them to everyone!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Both my kids have had braces with Dr. Montano and both times were flawless! The office staff was wonderful, wait time was never long, everything was explained up front so there were never any surprises! I absolutely recommend Dr. Montano and even though we’ve moved to LA they were always more than helpful with appointment times that worked with the two hour commute for appointments. Never a single issue and there’s even Keurig delicious coffee while you wait!<//Text>

<Review>My smile needed help so I went to Montano & Cardall. I chose them because of all of the great reviews and the great results that they produce. Now I think I have a great  smile and it is all thanks to Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists. They have a great atmosphere with very friendly and helpful employees. Everyone who works here is great at their jobs. If you need orthodontic work I would definitely recommend Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists.< /Review></record>

<Text>We absolutely love our experiences with Montano and Cardall. Both of my children now have beautiful smiles and I am currently getting treated with invisalign and couldn't be more excited to see my results.
Each and every visit we've had has always been a pleasurable one. The office staff are all professional and so nice and always smiling.
I would highly recommend this office.

Thank you for giving us confidence in our smiles :)< /Text>< response>

This is an outstanding Orthodontic office and I cannot say enough good things about them.  The orthodontists and staff are very skilled and compassionate and the office staff is extremely competent and pleasant. All 3 of our children had a situation where their jaws were not growing properly. We went to two other orthodontists prior to going to Montano and Cardall and both of those offices recommended plan was to pull numerous teeth from my 3 children, use braces to straighten their teeth and then give them jaw surgery as young adults. After further research we found Montano and Cardall. Their recommended treatment was completely different. By using a Herbst appliance and braces, they were able to slowly encourage their jaws to grow and then used braces to align their teeth properly. Two of our three children have already completed their treatment and have beautiful, healthy teeth and jaws. We are all completely thrilled with Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists. Plus they do everything they can to make each trip to the orthodontist pleasant and fun! It has been a very positive experience working with this office and I highly recommend going for a consultation.<//text>

<Text>To make this review quick and simple, going to Montano and Cardall Orthodontics to get my braces is the best decision I have made. I've reviewed various complaints from friends and the orthodontist they went to for their braces and was told they weren't completely satisfied with their care and treatment. Montano and Cardall is everything I wanted from an orthodontics. The care I received was excellent and always had a warm welcome for my appointments. I recommend this place to everyone !<//Text>< pics>

<text>Montano & Cardall Orthodontics have been treating my family for a very long time! First, my dad, then my uncle, and now my sister and I have had the pleasure of being treated by two very phenominal orthodontists! I had Dr. Cardall for most of my treatment and I'd say he is a perfectionist! He strived to get my teeth exactly where they should be and even though there was times I practically wanted to rip my braces off myself, I am very happy I didn't because the results are worth the wait! I personally had a great experience! The staff are very friendly and seem to genuinely care about how you are doing!  My dentist recommend I go to an orthodontist and we chose Montano because we already knew they were great. You will not be disappointed if you choose Montano and Cardall Orthodontists!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>I moved from another country and I had my braces already. One friend recommended me to visit Montano and Cardall office, so when I went there, was a nice place with nice people. The doctor explained me the process and in every appointment I was excited. After they took my braces, I felt my teeth much better, they are the best I recommend.</Text>< pictures>

I came to Montano Orthodontics and do not regret any part of it. My experience overall was great. Dr. Montano along with all the staff were absolutely amazing, kind, and always eager to help in a positive manner. I would refer this orthodontic to anyone and everyone. The inside office itself is eye candy due to the spacious lounge and beautiful canvas images posted along with former patient’s smiles.<//Text>

Our family has had an absolutely great experience here. All three of my daughters needed braces, and all were treated here with great results. (Dr. Montano actually even diagnosed the cause of a breathing problem that my middle daughter was experiencing and corrected it by placing a palate expander.)  We are extremely pleased with the care and attention our family has received here and we highly recommend this practice.</text>

< Review>
Happy Mom! My daughter was 10 when her dentist requested an orthodontist. It was either braces now or surgery later. Of course braces sounds best! We've had only great reviews about  Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall. We decided to allow Montana and Cardall to help us with our daughters teeth. Every visit we've had to the orthodontists office has been a pleasure. From the desk up front to all the employees that work there have been beyond amazing. You can definitely  appreciate the friendship that the employees have with one another even joking around with the doctors is fun. You can't find that awesome work place atmosphere very often. My daughter is smiling always and her teeth look beautiful  thanks to there whole team. You can't go wrong when going to Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, and staff!   The Vermillions<//Review>

The office is clean, bright and comfortable, the staff is so friendly and takes the time to explain every step of the process! Every appointment a great experience.

Always welcoming us with a smile and even commenting on how they thought our treatment was coming along. My brother and I both came here and are very happy with how our smiles turned out. He got regular braces and I got the Invisalign. I decided to get treatment because I had one tooth that was gradually moving over time and my alignment was off. I wanted to fix that before anything got worse and caused problems later on in life. I defiantly recommend this place.

We decided Dec 2015 that it was time for my daughter to finally get braces to fix her teeth. They didn't look that bad but she wanted braces to straighten them out. Montano and his staff were amazing from day one. They are all very nice and helpful. My daughter had 9 baby teeth still left at the age of 14 that had to be removed one surgically and they were helpful in getting all this taken care of. Appointments to get her wire fixed/trimmed if it broke or was too long were super easy and fast to get. I would recommend Montano and Cardall to anyone looking to get braces.</Text>

Let's say the first time was over 10 years ago, before I had my wisdom teeth removed through a not so great office.  Going through Montano & Cardall Orthodontics was a pleasant surprise.  Easy to schedule appointments, didn't have to wait more than 5 or 10 minutes before being called back to be seen.  The application of the braces themselves was amazing compared to what I had experienced elsewhere before, as well as the removal.  The staff is amazing and actually try to ensure you are comfortable and explain exactly what is going on.  I would like to thank all the staff at Montano & Cardall for my new smile.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

first of all.  I work out of town so it is very important that my appointment time is at the time of my appointment. My sons appointments were always on time.  I loved that.  When I called with a question they answered it when I called them.  Everyone at the office is friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend Montano & Cardall Orthodontics.< /review>

After visiting Dr. Montano, we were glad to know that he was able to correct it.

Today my daughter got her braces removed and her teeth and bite look beautiful.  Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, and the entire staff at Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists have always treated us with professionalism, and care.

The reason I went to Montano and Cardall was because my dentist, Dr kent, recomended us. From the first time we walked in I knew we would have a great time there. They gave us a tour of the office and told us everything that we needed to know. My teeth had an overbite and they fixed up my teeth pretty! Smiling is GREAT because I can show off my teeth! The team is unbelievably nice and they made sure i was okay. Montano and Cardall are the perfect people for braces!</Text>

Amazing staff and facility! The staff is always super friendly and helpful. My teeth before braces weren't the best but weren't the worst. I really wanted to go to a place were they would feel comfortable and this was the place! My smile now is amazing and it was all worth it. Some advice I would have to give is- wear your bands! And make sure you bring attention to any concerns you may have, do not be afraid to ask questions-- they will be more than happy to answer them!<//Text>

If someone were to ask me how my experience was with Montano & Cardall Orthodontics, I was say it was superior.  This clinic is so welcoming and all the people who are apart of it are SO sweet and caring.  They truly care about each of their patients and work very hard to give them only the best results.  Professionalism doesn't get much better than Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall.  If you're looking into orthodontic treatment, choose these people hands down!!</review>

<Text>Before I had braces, I was very insecure with how my teeth looked and I did not like to smile very much. I also used to have a lot of problems with ear and jaw pain because I had an offset jaw and was unaware about it. These lead me towards pursuing orthodontic treatment and I am extremely happy that I chose Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to fix my teeth and jaw. I heard about Montano & Cardall through some friends and I decided to check it out. From the moment I walked in I knew how well I would be treated there. The staff is very nice and they make you feel welcome and comfortable even when your mouth is in pain. If I would have never gone to Montano & Cardall, I might have never known the problems that my jaw was causing, therefore, the problems may have never been corrected and I would still be in a lot of pain to this day. However, I made the smart choice in choosing this orthodontist and I could not be more happy with the results. I got my braces off one day ago and I cannot stop smiling because my teeth are practically perfect now. I want people to look at my smile and I feel more confident about myself all thank to Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall. If you or anyone are considering choosing this orthodontist for whatever reason, I highly recommend them because I have nothing but good things to say.</Text>< Pictures>

Excellent care for my son's teeth.  Doctor Montano and Cardall are very competent specialists and the results were great! My son was so happy yesterday after they removed his braces, he could not stop sending pictures to his friends and show his beautiful teeth. I was very happy for him as well. For year and a half, we received an excellent care from very friendly and knowledgable staff. Everything in the office is state of the art. We really had a wonderful experience.< /text>

Dr. Montano and his staff were very friendly and professional during the year I had Invisalign due to a gum recession.  Within a year, my teeth were perfectly straight and my gum recession improved.  The staff took time with me from the first consultation to the very last appointment.  The office is also very clean.  I would highly recommend Dr. Montano to all my family and friends.</Review>

My daughter started seeing Dr. Montano when she was only 6 years old.  A friend recommended that we see Dr. Montano because he was the Best in town.  My daughter's teeth were so crowded, they were pushing out one of her permanent teeth.  We also needed to see a periodontist before she was able to start her orthodontic work.  Dr. Montano and the periodontist had great communication.  Everyone in the office treated my daughter with such care.  She always enjoyed going to her visits.  It is a pleasant and inviting environment.  My daughter got her braces off today.  WOW!!!  She looks amazing.  She has been smiling all day and showing off her new teeth.  I highly recommend Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall.  My son is 10 and he has been going in for a couple of years for a consultation and monitoring.  He will most likely start his treatment in couple of years.  It is great to know that the orthodontists are keeping a close eye on him and he will start when his mouth is ready.< /review>

<Review>I have been going to Doctor Montano and Cardall for about a year and a half now and I just got my braces off yesterday! I am completely satisfied with how my teeth turned out. Before my braces, I had an overbite and many gaps. Since I have gotten my braces off I have straight beautiful teeth. Doctor Montano and Cardall have done an amazing job! Everyone in the office is nice, helpful, and I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes to go back for my appointment. Sarah and penny were my favorite hygienists! They are both extremely kind and always ask me how I am and about my day etc. If you are looking for a great orthodontist go to Doctor Montano and Cardall you won't regret it, I promise.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>I needed orthodontic treatment because my teeth, like many people, were really crooked. I did not like my smile at all, and I always closed my mouth when I smiled. We chose Montano and Cardall due to the great reviews and feedback given to us my friends. The staff over there is extremely courteous and friendly to us as patients, and because of Montano and Cardall themselves, I got my braces off earlier than anticipated. So now, my teeth are straighter than a steel beam. I now feel confident with the way I smile. We will highly recommend Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to anyone who needs orthodontic treatment due to there unbeatable service!<//Text><time>1520521241169<//time><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Name>

Dr Montano and Cardall are both amazing dentist and very professional. I was hesitant at first to begin orthodontic treatment thinking it was going to take 2plus years to be able to have the pretty straight smile I've always wanted. They gave me an estimated time of finish which was approximately 14 months, and they were almost spot on give or take 2 weeks! You always feel welcomed the moment you walk into the office with a very professional greeting and they know everyone on first name basis. The girls make the office feel at home with their bright personalities and very professional approach. They are constantly doing fun things to keep their patients active within their practice and up to date on the latest research on orthodontic treatment. The office is probably one of the cleanest dental offices I have been in! If you are hesitant with orthodontic treatment like I was I would recommend going into their office for a orthodontic consultation with their one of a kind consultants. I would highly recommend this office to anyone looking into orthodontic treatment.< /Text>

Our family has had an absolutely great experience here. All three of my daughters needed braces, and all were treated here with great results. (Dr. Montano actually even diagnosed the cause of a breathing problem that my middle daughter was experiencing and corrected it by placing a palate expander.)  We are extremely pleased with the care and attention our family has received here and we highly recommend this practice.< /text>

I have been with Dr. Montano for about 11 years having braces before and then invisalign later.  My mouth was too small, my jaw alignment was off, my teeth were very crooked.  Dr. Montano and his team has corrected all of my issues! I LOVE my smile now! I am not insecure about smiling and Dr. Montano and his team were always so precise and careful to always make the right decisions.  If you are looking to have any corrections made to your smile always check with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall first! They are amazing!< /Text>

I first went to see Dr. Montano and Cardall about a year and a half ago, and I've had nothing but great experiences every time I've gone in since. I decided to go with M&C because of their excellent reputation and top of the line office/equipment. While there are some places that are cheaper, you definitely get what you pay for in regards to quality and efficiency. Both doctors are knowledgable and passionate about their craft. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. I just got my braces off earlier today and I couldn't be happier with the results! I didn't realize at the time how much I needed braces, but now when I look back at old photos I see a huge improvement. I highly recommend Dr. Montano and Cardall.< /review>

After going to different consultations at other Orthodontics offices and being told different things each time, I was about to give up looking for the perfect office that would make me feel comfortable, and not worried that all they wanted was my money. Finally, a friend recommended Dr. Montano's office and I said "why not. Doesn't hurt to go check it out." Well,  from the moment I walked in I knew this was the place.  The environment is very welcoming and of a higher scale.  Super clean and comfortable and the entire staff is always kind and helpful. After my consultation with Dr. Montano, I went back within the week to get my treatment started.  It's been about 9 months and I'm finally at the end of my treatment (i was just getting some minor tweaks done).
I couldn't be more happy with the results we achieved!!< /Text>

My son David did not like to smile because of his teeth so we decided he needed braces. Dr. Montano had taken care of my teeth and my older son's teeth, so he was our obvious choice since we were both pleased with our results. David just got his braces off and is so excited. He loves his smile and cannot stop smiling! David enjoyed each of his office visits and we were always greeted with a smile. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. On the day David's braces were removed everyone was so excited and congratulatory. From start to finish, we had a great experience.</Text>

<Review>The staff at Montano & Cardall is amazing. They are knowledgeable and very helpful. I always felt like they explained each process to ensure I understood my child's medical needs. The staff always had smiles on their faces and seem to enjoy their jobs.  This patient and caring atmosphere always made the visits easier for my child. Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are wonderful doctors. They too are patient, caring, and knowledgeable. I like the set-up of the office. The openness makes it easy to hear what the staff /doctor is discussing with the patent, which is great when the patient is a child.  I would recommend this office to family and friends.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We loved our experience here! My daughter had to get braces and was told she would have them off in about a year. Today she got them off one year and one month later...her teeth are perfectly straight and she now loves her smile! The staff and Drs. are friendly, helpful, and awesome!...and we were always seen right on time. If we had to choose again where to go for braces, this would be the place! 😁<//Text>

If you are looking for the "BEST" look no more, Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are two miracle workers in Bakersfield when it comes to working on teeth. When your treatment is finalized you will smile in your sleep.  The staff are marvelous; it’s an excellent place for the children and young adults.< /Text>

I was always so excited for every appointment I had. Everybody is so kind and want what is best for you at all times. Although I'll miss going to all my appointments, I absolutely love my new smile!

< Review>
My son David did not like to smile because of his teeth so we decided he needed braces. Dr. Montano had taken care of my teeth and my older son's teeth, so he was our obvious choice since we were both pleased with our results. David just got his braces off and is so excited. He loves his smile and cannot stop smiling! David enjoyed each of his office visits and we were always greeted with a smile. All the staff are very friendly and helpful. On the day David's braces were removed everyone was so excited and congratulatory. From start to finish, we had a great experience.< /Review>

Both my husband and daughter recently completed orthodontic services with Dr. Montano. My husband did Invisalign while my daughter did traditional braces.  Dr. Montano and his staff are excellent.  You are seen promptly at your appointment time which is wonderful when pulling a child from school midday.  Both the Invisalign and braces were completed on time with wonderful results.

The staff at Montano & Cardall is amazing. They are knowledgeable and very helpful. I always felt like they explained each process to ensure I understood my child's medical needs. The staff always had smiles on their faces and seem to enjoy their jobs.  This patient and caring atmosphere always made the visits easier for my child. Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are wonderful doctors. They too are patient, caring, and knowledgeable. I like the set-up of the office. The openness makes it easy to hear what the staff /doctor is discussing with the patent, which is great when the patient is a child.  I would recommend this office to family and friends.< /Text>

I never really considered getting braces until I was referred by my dentist and I am glad that he made the referral. I am extremely happy with the final results. The team at Montano and Cardall are passionate and friendly. Also there was never any pain other than short term tenderness. The whole process was smooth and I enjoyed each visit.<//Review>

<text>My dentist is the one who referred me to Montano & Cardall Orthodontic about two years ago when it was time for me to get braces. In my opinion my teeth weren't too bad but I didn't really like them either. Once I walked into Montano Orthodontic I knew that I would like it there because everyone was really friendly. Now that my braces are finally off I can say I LOVE my smile. Everyone on the team is really sweet and they always have a big smile on there face from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave. In my opinion if you need braces then you should definitely go to Montano & Cardall Orthodontic's.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I initially had braces on in high school but with another orthodontist and was very unsatisifed. My second time around I was referred to Montano and Cardall by aunt who had her orthodontic work done many years ago. I just got my braces off and I’m so happy I decided to go with them. Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall as well as their staff did an amazing job! Throughout my experience with this office for the past two years I have told everyone about them and will continue to do so. They truly are the best!</text>

My parents and I decided to pursue orthodontic treatment after we we're told by my dentist that my left k-9 tooth had not came in. I would rarely smile because of my missing tooth. We we're recommended by my dentist to doctor Montano & Cardall orthodontics. We had never heard of them, but after my first visit I had a great experience. We decided to ask around and the people we spoke to that were previous patients had nothing but amazing things to say. It made my parents and myself feel confident about working with doctor Montano & Cardall. I had an amazing experience with both doctor Montano, doctor Cardall, but also all the staff. The lady's at the front desk and dental assistants were always so professional. I am very pleased with my smile and feel more confident about smiling. To anyone that is considering seeing an orthodontist I would 100% recommend Montano & Cardall orthodontic specialist. It is a little more than other orthodontist but they do offer a payment plan. From now on every time someone comments on my smile I'll be proud to say that I had my work done at Montano & Cardall Orthodontics.< /Text>

We did a lot of research before deciding to go with Dr. Montano for our daughter’s Invisalign treatment. After meeting with him and his staff, we knew that he was our guy! He is absolutely wonderful with our daughter and incredibly friendly. The office staff is very kind. Our daughter just finished her Invisalign treatment and we are very happy with the results. We will be back with daughter #2! Thank you for such a great experience!<//Review>

Who knew that at age 65 I would need braces, but my teeth shifted and there I was needing an orthodontist.  I had taken my children to an orthodontist many years ago and it was not a pleasant experience. I was not looking forward to getting braces.

Fortunately my dentist referred me to Montano & Cardall. What I was not looking forward to turned out to be a good experience, well as good as going to a dentist can be.

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are wonderful. They are knowledgeable and explained everything, plus they are very nice. That is a hard combination to find. I found out that I could get Invisaligns, that was a good choice, they were easy to wear and people couldn’t tell I was wearing them.

The staff at Montano & Cardall are nice, friendly, and very helpful.

Tho office is beautiful and clean. Both children and adults are comfortable in the office environment.

The appointments ran right on time so there is very little wait time.

<text>The Montano & Cardall team is exceptional!!! We would highly recommend this orthodontic specialists to anyone.  My son's braces just came off today and we are very happy with the results.  His teeth were aligned to perfection in less than two years.....several months ahead of schedule.  All the staff in the office are very friendly and professional.  His visits were relatively short because the wait was very minimal. When my son had any unexpected issues with his braces, it was very easy to get him in right away to fix the issue.  They were always very accommodating and the office is very efficient.< /text>< userid>

My experience with Dr. Montano Dr. Cardall and their staff has been amazing. From day one they all have been positive, encouraging, and remained patient and helpful through out my care. Their office is very welcoming and doesn't have your typical orthodontics environment. One of the many benefits of this office is that you could get a second opinion within the minute, seeing as their are two specialists working in the same place. If you are at all interested in getting braces I 100% recommend going to Montano & Cardall.<//Text>

Very clean and organized office. Always on time with appointments.  Awesome friendly staff.  We are very happy with this whole experience with my daughter.  We will continue to use them for myself and kids. Montano and Cardall are very professional and easy to talk to. I would recommend to family and friends.<//Review>

I enjoyed my time at this office. They are very friendly and explain to you in detail what your treatment will be like. I had my braces on for a little over a year and I LOVED the end results. They really do pay attention to detail to give you the best possible smile!< /review>

My experience At montano was the greatest! Everybody was always smiling and super nice. They were always super organized when scheduling appointments and super quick when I arrived for my appointment. The office was always in neat condition and they were super clean. This is by far one of the best orthodontic office in Bakersfield. My sister is continuing to work with them and she is also very please with their service. I recommend this place to anyone :)</review>

I had my braces on for 2 years and 4 months, and I got them because my teeth were crowded. Both of the doctors are very good at their jobs, and my teeth look really good now. The wait time is really short, which I appreciate. The staff is really helpful, and my experience here was great.<//Text>

My daughter received orthodontic treatment from Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists through the Smile For A Lifetime Foundation. She was really lacking the confidence she needed because of her teeth. We went in not really sure what to expect. But now coming out, our expectations have been surpassed! Not only did they address the issues with her teeth, but they really took into account the whole structure of her face. This was the first time we had encountered such care and concern for a patient. Most orthodontists just want to fix the teeth. It has been nearly 3 years since my daughter first got her braces on, but the transformation is AMAZING! She has so much more confidence now and I find her smiling more often than not. Overall, working with the Montano & Cardall team has been a wonderful experience. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

I am a former patient of Dr Montano and was very pleased with the outcome of my teeth.  I decided to come back to have braces for my son and I’m even more impressed with the quality of treatment my son received.  His teeth need a lot of work and he now has a million dollar smile!!< /review>

<text>We started with Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists when my daughter was 7.  Her dentist noticed a cross bite at one of her regular visits and referred us over for a consult.  I was concerned with her being so young to start any orthodontic work.  I thought what was the big deal right now.   But,  after looking at the pictures and x-rays and  Dr. Montano educating us at her consult we decided we shouldn't wait.   They fixed my daughters cross bite and  a couple of years later got braces because of crooked teeth that never aligned. She recently just got them off.  We are so pleased with her smile and how beautiful her teeth  aligned up.  Both Dr. Montano and Dr.Cardall were wonderful with my daughter.  Very pleasant and kind each and every time we've been there. The office is welcoming and very fun...always having contests and giving prizes away.
I have 2 other daughters and hope we don't need anymore orthodontic  work but if we do, we will return to these guys.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I chose Doctors Montano and Cardall because they offered a really cool scholarship for braces in which it would be free of charge with me which was perfect because I couldn't afford orthodontic treatment. Words can't express how happy I am with my smile now, I want to show it off to the world!!! The team were very professional and demonstrated their expertise with every treatment I've ever received. I would advise others that there is always a solution to the problems that they have and go pursue any change they want to make within themselves!< /text>< gmapID>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>My experience with Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall and their staff was awesome!!! It’s been about 2 ½ years when I made the decision to get my braces on and it was the best decision I ever made. I use to be so self-conscious about myself never really smiled, everyone would always ask why I looked so serious or mad when I wasn't. I just didn't smile at all. My teeth were pretty bad so, I decided one day to make an appointment with my dentist to see what I could do to improve my smile. That’s when they recommended to go see Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall office. When I went to my appointment the staff super nice. They answered all my questions and concerns I had at the time. Now after 2 ½ years braces are off and it has given me a major boost in my self-esteem. =D I love the way me teeth turned out after the treatment. I definitely would recommend anyone that isn't happy about their smile to go with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall they both are amazing doctors.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Dr. Montano did such an excellent job with my daughter's smile.  Her teeth are beautifully straight now, and it has given her a boost in confidence.  The staff at Montano’s office were always friendly and happy to answer any of our questions.  They were also able to consistently get us in quickly when she broke off a bracket or snapped a powerband by mistake.  My Daughter is the second of my children to go to Montano, and I could not recommend him enough!!  Thank you for the fantastic service!!<//Text>

<Text>For those of you looking for a great orthodontist you have come to the right place!  Dr. Montano and his staff have been great!  Not only are they wonderful, but Dr. Montano is exceptional! We joke that he’s now working on our second generation and will hopefully still be practicing when the third generation comes through!  He was my orthodontist when I was 15 and he also put braces on both of my brothers!  I’m a mother now of three children and my 13 year old, who is the youngest, just got them a couple of weeks ago.  She was not happy about having to get them on, (I mean what teenager is,) but now that she is seeing the changes so soon; she is very happy and is very comfortable with them.  Your child will walk away feeling well informed on where they are with their progress and confident after their visit.
As a parent nothing brings you more joy than to see your child’s beautiful smile after those braces come off and the confidence a wonderful smile gives them.
Every parent wants the BEST doctor for their child and I can tell you without a doubt, Dr. Montano is the BEST!  You will NOT be disappointed by Dr. Montano nor by his staff who have ALWAYS been incredible!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>To make this review quick and simple, going to Montano and Cardall Orthodontics to get my braces is the best decision I have made. I've reviewed various complaints from friends and the orthodontist they went to for their braces and was told they weren't completely satisfied with their care and treatment. Montano and Cardall is everything I wanted from an orthodontics. The care I received was excellent and always had a warm welcome for my appointments. I recommend this place to everyone !</Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< gmap_id>

My mother went to Montano Orthodontics when she had her braces. She then put my sister through him. Then finally it was my turn. Their team is amazing. They are very nice and always have a big smile on their face. Speaking of smiles, mine is amazing now that I got my braces off. I cannot help looking at it every chance I get. I recommend going to Montano & Cardall Orthodontic.< /review>

The staff is always amazing ! I came to Dr. Montano as a kid to get my braces, but after getting them off I lost my retainers and ended up having to go back last year. Their in house version of invisalign is amazing ! Their lab produces only the best quality aligners and I am so happy with the results ! Definitely the place to go</Text>

I had a severe overbite. My bottom teeth would dig into the roof of my mouth while I slept so I decided to get braces to help correct the problem. My dentist recommend Dr Montano and Dr Cardall.  After the consultation I decided I liked the treatment plan they came up with.
After 19 months, my braces are off and teeth feel great and look great. This was the best decision I could have made for teeth. The office staff and Drs are wonderful and very friendly. They worked around my schedule did their best to always fit me in immediately for emergencies, yes broken brackets happen!
I would recommend Montano and Cardall to friends and family.<//Review>

When I first thought about getting braces I was worried that I was going to have them on for a couple of years because how messed up I thought my teeth were. My husband had braces when he was in high school and when I went to his orthodontist I honestly didn't like them very much. So I talked to my Aunt-in-law and they went to Montano. I was like alright I'll go check it out. When I first went I loved it. Everyone is very friendly and nice. I sat down and talked to Dr Montano and he told me he can get my teeth fixed in 2 years even with having to get surgery. 2 years later and they're finally off and I love my new smile. Hands down Dr Montano and Dr Cardall are the best out there. They try to make your visit as most comfortable as possible, very flexible around when things come up and they work with your financial situation as well. I highly recommend coming to Montano and Cardall if you're thinking about braces!!!< /review>

<Text>We are so thankful for such a friendly, knowledgeable group at Montano & cardall. Among so many wonderful things about their office , the doctors themselves take time to explain to parents and kids what's happening. They are respectful and friendly, taking however much time is needed. The office is kid friendly, and never crowded. We are in and out, which my kids are never thrilled about because they want more time in the video game room!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377<//GmapID></record>

My daughter is so thankful for Montano & Cardall Orthodontics! Her best friend had recommend us to go here, because she was a customer and she loved the service and place. My daughter was not confident in her smile before braces and upon wearing braces she became more confident and now having her braces off, she smiles all day long! The staff there is so helpful and nice, they answer all questions, and they teach you step by step how to do the new things the ortho wants us to do. Being a customer there for over 2 years we have never had problems, and we have always been well taken care of! We had other experiences at different orthodontics and we highly recommend  Montano & Cardall! They're a one of a kind service and there is no other place like there! We had a great experience and we defiantly will refer friends! Montano & Cardall orthodontics staff became our family!!< /Review>

<review>I had my metal braces on for a year and half a little more than expected as I wasn't fully satisfied with my teeth on what was supposed to be my last visit but the doctors were more than willing to work with me and we're not pushy to have them taken on off until I was fully satisfied. The front desk was especially great they sent me extra rubber bands if I wasn't able to come in and always accommodated me.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My mother went to Montano Orthodontics when she had her braces. She then put my sister through him. Then finally it was my turn. Their team is amazing. They are very nice and always have a big smile on their face. Speaking of smiles, mine is amazing now that I got my braces off. I cannot help looking at it every chance I get. I recommend going to Montano & Cardall Orthodontic.< /Review>

Honestly I am not sure I can say enough good things about this office and Dr Montano’s team. They have been beyond helpful and they take the term concierge service to a whole other level. I have never had this good of an experience with a dental or medical offices. I highly recommend Dr Montano to anyone needing or wanting braces, Invisalign or any other type of orthodontic work!

<review>From my first consultation, to when I had my last Invisalign tray, Montano and Cardall orthodontics has been nothing other than great!  The whole staff is friendly and polite.  I'm always seen very promptly after checking in for my appointment.

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall both worked on my case and they were both very knowledgable and enthusiastic with my progress.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience with Invisalign.  I definitely recommend them to anyone in the market for braces or Invisalign.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377<//gmap_id></record>

My experience At montano was the greatest! Everybody was always smiling and super nice. They were always super organized when scheduling appointments and super quick when I arrived for my appointment. The office was always in neat condition and they were super clean. This is by far one of the best orthodontic office in Bakersfield. My sister is continuing to work with them and she is also very please with their service. I recommend this place to anyone :)</text>

I would definitely recommend this orthodontic to relatives and friends. Great treatment in a short amount of time. There was never a problem rescheduling an appointment, and no problem fitting the appointment into my busy schedule. I was embarrassed to smile or to even show my teeth at all, but Montano & Cardall Orthodontic's invisalign fixed me up in no time! I am not afraid to show off my straight teeth, and my beautiful smile, as what their staff told me. The friendly staff at this orthodontic are always positive, and made sure you were comfortable before doing any work. Once again, I am very satisfied with the results from, which i feel, is the best orthodontic in Bakersfield.</Text>

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are the best orthodontists around. They actually take the time to make sure you have the best smile around. My previous orthodontist always rushed me and I didn't like the results I was seeing. Thanks to Montano Orthodontics and the wonderful staff I now have a beautiful smile! :)< /Review>

My husband, 2 sons & nephew all had braces & Invisilign done by Dr. Montano & Cardall. We have been so happy with the results we recommend them to everyone. My husband was reluctant to get Invisilign but after his treatment his teeth are beautiful & it cured his TMJ. The staff are amazing & we never had to wait when we came in for appointments. I loved how quickly they got patients in & out.  I am the last one in the family to get my teeth straightened & I will definitely be going to Montana & Cardall, they are great at what they do & they're a pleasure to work with.  I highly recommend them.< /Text>

Before I went to Montano and Cardall I had an overbite and a gap between my front teeth. I hated smiling because I thought my teeth were ugly. The first time I went there the staff was so kind and they took my feelings to heart. I was nervous about my braces but was ready to have a beautiful smile. The process of getting my braces put on was very quick and easy. The people in the office talked me through the process step by step, before they started. Every time I had a problem with my braces they fixed it as soon as possible. Now my braces are gonna and I have the beautiful smile I've always wanted. Thank you Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall, and all of the staff in the office. I am now way more confident than before and love showing off my smile!!!<//Text>

I went to Montano and Cardall orthodontics after receiving a recommendation from my dentist. I had always been unhappy with my smile and thought it was finally time to take care of it. After getting some surprising news that my case was going to be more in depth than the typical orthodontic case, I wasn’t sure what to do. I was informed along with braces I would also need to undergo two surgeries. This news was not fun to hear but I knew I needed to proceed. I never felt the need to get a second opinion because Dr. Montano and the staff made me feel comfortable and secure that my well being was in great hands. They were very quick to get started and on my way to a perfect smile. 3 months after getting my braces I had my first surgery. That experience was a game changer. The procedure is known as SARPE (surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion) and I’m not going to sugar coat it, it SUCKED! I was unable to chew anything for 2 months, causing me to lose 25 pounds, it left me with a inch gap in between my two front teeth, and I also had a large very uncomfortable metal device attached to my top teeth holding my jaw together. Needless to say for about 10 months (the total time it took to completely heal) I was immensely regretting my decision. This also led me to have a conversation with Dr. Montano about my apprehension to proceed with the next, more invasive, surgery. But luck was fortunately on my side! Dr. Montano felt the results from my first surgery were better than expected and I would be able to get away without having to do the second procedure. This was amazing news for me to hear and brightened my spirits.
So after 2 years and 3 months and one horrible surgical experience I am happy to say my braces are now off and I am happier than ever. My road to a beautiful smile would not be the same without everyone at the Montano and Cardall office. I cannot speak highly enough of all of them. Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall were incredible at making me feel that my case was important and it was their mission to provide me with the best care. Every one of the assistants are caring and sympathetic. They took special care of me and I am forever grateful. Anyone who is unhappy with their smile should definitely go see Montano and Cardall orthodontic specialists! It will change your life.<//text>

And now her teeth look amazing and now she's not afraid to smile!! She is extremely happy with the outcome and so am I. He did an amazing job then and still does an amazing job now.

I loved how friendly all the staff are and how clean the place is. I highly recommend this place, i was supposed to have braces for 2 years and got them off a few months earlier, so they are really effective fast if you keep up with what they tell you to do such as wear your rubber bands. The doctors are really good and make you feel welcomed everytime. 10/10 highly recommend< /text>

My niece had her braces done through their offices. They were very good at keeping us updated as to the treatment plan. The offices were very clean and I had a high level of comfort with their practices. They were always very positive when talking with us as well. Would highly recommend their offices.</review>

< review>
I started my orthodontic and maxillofacial journey very unhappily.  I did not want braces or surgery.  Dr. Montano and his staff were AMAZING since Day One.  Everyone is so personable, helpful and informed.  Dr. Montano is a wonderful orthodontist.  He did an amazing job on my teeth and bite.  Dr. Montano hosts events for kids and adults.  He is very modern with technology.  His office is clean, warm, welcoming, organized.  I had to wait (for only about 15 minutes) ONE time during my entire experience.  Dr. Montano honors appointment times and is efficient.  At the end, I'm glad I took care of my necessary teeth/jaw issues and am VERY pleased with the results.  Thank you to Dr. Montano and all the wonderful staff I interacted with during the process.  There are so many kind, personal touches from the staff.  I would recommend Montano Orthodontics to anyone for excellent medical and personal attention.</review>

Dr. Montano is a terrific person I got my braces through smiles for lifetime and it was just an awesome experiment ! Everyone in the office is friendly and they learn your name they are really there for you whenever you need them. Also its a great place if you have a busy life they are extremely flexible with setting up appointments. AND THEY GET THE JOB DONE FAST, a lot of offices that many of my friends went to took triple the amount of time that I took and my teeth were worst then theirs. It took them a year and a half just about I went through everything from the metal band to rubber bands and my teeth dramatically changed !!! everywhere I go now I get people telling me how pretty my smile is. I love them all everyone should go to them ...and also they have a lot of pay options also !!! ...and also there office is so nice so nice ....well yeah they are the best !!</text>

My 15 and 12 year old sons both see Dr. Montano, and he and his staff have been amazing.  Both of my sons are autistic and can be a challenge, but the staff at Montano Orthodontics are patient and caring, allowing them time to adjust to any changes that have be made throughout the visit.  They both look forward to each visit, and as a result, our 12 year old twin girls are also excited about getting braces.</Text>

My sons and I have been going to Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall for 6 years and we have had an amazing experience. They are both amazing orthodontists.  They are very knowledgeable and care a lot about their patients. My oldest son has had 2 sets of braces and both orthodontists have saved my son a lot of pain and future problems.  I also had Invisalign and had a great experience.  The office staff is also very caring.  We always get the best treatment.  Through the years they have helped us in many ways.  I would definitely recommend these orthodontists and this office to everyone.

This place is amazing!!!
They have fast service and their friendly hospitality creates a warm welcoming atmosphere for the customers the minute they step foot in their office. They treat every customer as part of  their family and they serve you in a professional and kind manner. They are always concerned about the customer's. They go the extra mile to help. They send birthday, reminder, thank you cards to each customer they've treated; when you need extra rubber bands, it is guaranteed they send them in the mail directly to you. I definitely would recommend Montano and Cardall Orthodontics to anyone in need of braces (even if they are in thought about it ).< /Review>

<text>We have really loved our experience at Montano and Cardall Orthodontics.  My wife and I had our braces with Dr. Montano many years ago. This time around our daughter had the opportunity for Dr. Cardall  to work with her on braces.  We were very pleased with both doctors.  They were very thorough, attentive to any concerns or questions and personable. Their staff was so friendly and really made the attempt to connect with you and made you feel cared for and known.
My daughter will miss seeing her favorite orthodontist assistant- she definitely went above and beyond in helping her through some of the more extensive appointments.
Her last ortho visit was today, after two years of treatment, her bite is perfect now - AND her smile is just beautiful.
Another thing I really liked about their office was that they were prompt with getting you in for the time your appointment was scheduled.
We would definitely recommend them!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I owe my confidences to Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall. I came in two years ago with a horrible smile and today I left feeling like a new person. The service was always amazing; everyone was so nice to me. I remember the first time I was late; they were so kind and understood why I was late and squeezed me in. On that note this place is honestly the best and as a student, all my appointments worked around my schedule.<//text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>My daughter didn't have anything major wrong with her teeth.  She only required Invisalign for 12 months to perfect her bite. Invisalign was the perfect choice for her, as she is very responsible and wore her liners as required.  My son, on the other hand, requires more extensive work and is not quite as responsible, so we will have braces put on him next year.  We will be returning to Montano and Cardall for his treatment, as well.  The entire process ran very smoothly from start to finish.  We loved our consultation...everything was explained very clearly to us regarding the entire procedure and the finances.  I think my favorite thing about Montano and Cardall is the reception staff.  They are incredibly friendly and accommodating.  With crazy schedules these days it was absolutely imperative that we had a staff who could be flexible with appointment times.  They always went above and beyond to get us in when we needed to or change our appointment time if something came up.  We are very pleased with the final results of our daughter's smile.  It looks so beautiful and she is more confident than ever!</Review>< Time>

My daughter's teeth were extremely crooked. She was required to start treatment at third grade. They began treatment by widening her pallet in order to avoid having to pull teeth. I as very thankful that she did not have to have any teeth pulled.
I wanted her to go to Dr. Montano because he was my orthodontist. Her smile turned out beautiful and we are very happy with the results. Dr. Montano's office was extremely  efficient. I would recommend Dr. Montano to all people in need of orthodontic care.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>When I first got braces I was really nervous. I wasn't sure how they would be
, all I knew is that I wanted my teeth fixed. My sister and brother had also gone to Montano (before Cardall was around) and gotten their teeth fixed. I was just next in line. The braces felt weird and were hard to get used to. They hurt and ached my teeth. It got to the point where I wanted to pull my teeth out, but it was all worth it. My teeth look amazing and I don't think anyone could have done better. The moment they took them off my teeth just felt naked. It was very unusual having these shiny slimy things replace my metal gear.Though it took a while to get used to changing back my teeth look great. I know longer have to worry about crooked teeth and a cross bite thanks to Cardall and Montano.< /Text></record>

<review>My treatment takes longer than anticipated. However, Dr. Montano takes a good care of me. He works collaboratively with my oral surgeon during the treatment. Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, and the staff are great. They are very friendly and supportive.  His office has with all modern medical equipments. The price may not be cheap, but you get a first class treatment, so it's totally worth it. I can't wait to take off my braces by the end of this year. Thanks the Montano Orthodontics team.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>I've had a great experience at Montano & Cardall. My teeth look amazing. Before treatment, my teeth were beginning to break down from years of being misaligned.  The older I get, the more important it is to protect and preserve my teeth for the future.  Mantano & Cardall have treated both of my children with  braces over the past five years. We have had nothing but great results every time. Now,  it's my husbands turn and I am confident that his outcome will be just as great. The staff is always caring and professional. Doctors Montano & Cardall are very personable and  give every patient  their full attention. It is that personal touch that really make a difference. A big thank you  to everyone at Montano & Cardall for my beautiful smile!<//Text><pics>None<//pics><name>Summer Cunningham< /name>< user>

Montano and Cardall has been great. They have fixed my bite even though it was very difficult and they have gone over and beyond. The staff is extremely friendly and has made sure this process has been as easy as possible. They have exceeded my expectations and I am very happy with the results.</text>

<rate>5<//rate><username>Vanessa Lasquade</username><Text>Before I had braces, I was very insecure with how my teeth looked and I did not like to smile very much. I also used to have a lot of problems with ear and jaw pain because I had an offset jaw and was unaware about it. These lead me towards pursuing orthodontic treatment and I am extremely happy that I chose Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to fix my teeth and jaw. I heard about Montano & Cardall through some friends and I decided to check it out. From the moment I walked in I knew how well I would be treated there. The staff is very nice and they make you feel welcome and comfortable even when your mouth is in pain. If I would have never gone to Montano & Cardall, I might have never known the problems that my jaw was causing, therefore, the problems may have never been corrected and I would still be in a lot of pain to this day. However, I made the smart choice in choosing this orthodontist and I could not be more happy with the results. I got my braces off one day ago and I cannot stop smiling because my teeth are practically perfect now. I want people to look at my smile and I feel more confident about myself all thank to Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall. If you or anyone are considering choosing this orthodontist for whatever reason, I highly recommend them because I have nothing but good things to say.< /Text><GmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377</GmapID>< Response>

<Text>This place is awesome! If you or your child is in need of orthodontic care--look no further. This is the place! From the time my daughter first entered the building 18 months ago to yesterday when she had her braces removed, we always felt welcome, supported and in very good hands. The doctors are very thorough and explained all the steps to us which eased our minds. She loved having her braces on but has not stopped smiling since having them removed! Her face is so bright now--thank you for making my daughter even more beautiful than she already was! We will be back with our other 2 children. :-)<//Text><response>None<//response><Rating>5</Rating></record>

I started going to Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall in May of 2016. I cannot be happier with my results, and the wonderful journey of orthodontics they led me on. They were always helpful, attentive, and even rewarded you for having good hygiene! I highly recommend them.</review>

Our son got his braces off yesterday and hasn't stopped smiling since.  From his initial consultation two years ago, to his last appointment we have found the staff at Montano & Cardall very professional.  Having people at the front desk who make eye contact and greet you with a smile definitely creates a positive atmosphere.  His treatment plan was explained very clearly to us, and to him.  Any questions we had were promptly answered.  He broke wires and brackets more than once ad was seen within 24 hours every time.  We will be taking our younger child to them when it is time for him to start orthodontic treatment.  We recommend Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to everyone who asks.< /Review>

I have been with Dr. Montano for about 11 years having braces before and then invisalign later.  My mouth was too small, my jaw alignment was off, my teeth were very crooked.  Dr. Montano and his team has corrected all of my issues! I LOVE my smile now! I am not insecure about smiling and Dr. Montano and his team were always so precise and careful to always make the right decisions.  If you are looking to have any corrections made to your smile always check with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall first! They are amazing!<//Text>

Mantano and Cardall have a very nice office with a wonderful staff.  They are always friendly and helpful. I was happy they could make my teeth and smile, as nice as they did.  I feel great now my braces are off!   I came here because my aunt and uncle got braces with Dr Mantano  when they were in school.  My advice is, this dentist  makes you feel comfortable and you will be happy to go here for a great smile!  Ty< /review>

<Text>Dr. Montano has been a prominent orthodontist for many years in Bakersfield. It's obvious that he and his staff have a lot of pride in their office and in their  patient care. As soon as you walk in, the receptionist makes sure you feel welcome.  The office is beautiful and well kept.  They supply free wifi, coffee, and fruit-infused water.  The kids can keep busy with video games near the waiting area, and there is a sitting area for the parents to be near their child during the exam. The assistants were more than willing to answer any questions that I had after  appointments, and they seemed to connect well with my son.  He is more than happy with his new smile, as am I.  I'm glad I decided to trust a well established orthodontist in Bakersfield.</Text>< Pics>

I love everything about Montano & Cardall Orthodontic. I thought I would forever have to live with my underbite, and that no one would be able to help me have the smile I wanted. Dr. Montano made my dreams of a having pretty smile a reality. I am forever thankful. He collaborated with me and my oral surgeon on exactly what I needed. He made it incredibly easy for my surgeon to identify what needed to happen during my surgery. Dr. Montano made this journey an incredibly easy one. I just sat back and enjoyed the ride while he put in all of the work. He and his staff are very friendly. The office is very comfortable and inviting. He is extremely educated and I would trust no one else with the journey of braces. He knows exactly what he is doing. Well worth everything. Thank you Dr. Montano for everything. You are amazing!!< /Text>

Before I went to Doc. Montano & Cardall I thought my teeth were fine clearly I was wrong. They really take care of you and take the time to make the atmostsphere a welcoming place. I just got my braces off a few days ago and I feel free and fantastic! I feel a lot more confident and find it easier to smile! The team is outstanding! You can tell that they are actually caring and that they care about you. My advice to others is to always wear your rubber bands when the docs say to! I didn't and had to end up wearing them longer. One more thing to add they have amazing financial options so you don't have to worry about going broke to get an amazing smile!!< /Review>

Dr. Montano straightened the teeth of all three of my kids, and they look fabulous. They still come back, even though they are all done, and get hugs from staff members.  It says a lot about a doctor's office and the staff there when kids actually look forward to going!  Bravo, Montano and Cardall.  I will absolutely recommend you to everyone who asks!!!< /review>

Every visit was great. The staff become your friends, everyone is nice, and the atmosphere is safe and warm. The facility itself is clean, professional, and well-organized. You never have to wait past your appointment time, and there is a small arcade to entertain children (or adults, if you're into that kind of thing). I'm sad to get my braces off, since I won't be coming back anymore. If you're looking for an orthodontist, whether it be an interview for a school research paper or getting braces, this is the best place in Bakersfield (Probably even California, but I haven't checked unpopulated areas. Besides that, they're the best out of everyone else).<//review>

<text>I decided to pursue orthodontic treatment because my teeth were extremely crooked. Before pursuing orthodontic treatment, I was a bit insecure about smiling. My family and I decided to choose Montano & Cardall to do my orthodontic treatment because my dentist recommended them to me after hearing positive feedback from their clients. After getting my braces removed, I fell in love with the way my teeth looked. They were very immaculate. Now, I can’t stop looking at them nor stop smiling. The staff at Montano are very well-organized, friendly, and helpful. As long as you follow the doctors’ instructions, you will be satisfied with the results.< /text><user_name>Nathalia G</user_name>< rate>

As a 55 year old who has never had braces, I found myself becoming more self conscious about my shifting teeth that became more crooked with every passing year.

My treatment took just under a year and other than very slight discomfort after changing trays, was pain free.

Dr. Montano and his staff are very knowledgeable, friendly and take time to explain the entire treatment. I was very appreciative of the fact that I never sat in the waiting room for more than 5 minutes to be called to the back for my appointment!

My only regret is that it took me this long to spend a little extra money on myself. I am so excited to show off my new smile!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The staff was very kind and gentle when doing the procedures. Another orthodontist told me I would need surgery to fix my overbite, but Montano and Cardall were confident that they could fix it without surgery, and they did. I highly recommend them to anyone needing orthodontic treatment.<//review>

<text>I had my daughter go there two years ago and I could not be more pleased with the results.
I just finished my treatment with Dr. Montano a couple of months ago and I honestly have nothing but great things to say about the whole experience.
I’m very pleased with the results as well as the way I was treated by the staff.
The office is always spotless, well organized.  Among mahy other things,  I appreciate the fact that I never had to wait long for my appointments.
Thank you for giving me and my daughter the beautiful smile we’ve always wanted.
Dr Montano is the best.  Highly recommended.<//text>< Resp>

I had braces as a teenager; however, only wore my retainer a couple of years after getting them. As a result, my teeth shifted a bit and after starting to notice it more and more in pictures I decided I wanted to straighten them again.

My dentist recommended Montana and Cardall, so I went for a consultation. I didn't expect that there would be as much of a medical need as a cosmetic need to straighten my teeth. My bite had also shifted, which can apparently cause problems.

I chose Invisalign on Dr. Montano's suggestion. During the course of my 14 month treatment, the staff were friendly and helpful.

My teeth are straight again and my bite is on point. Definitely happy with the results. I recommend Montano and Cardall as well as wearing your retainer!<//text>

<text>I was referred to Dr Montano by my dentist who said he would take care of me. I scheduled an appointment with him. Meeting with Crystal and getting an office tour was great. Everyone was very friendly.  I was very embarrassed to smile because of the huge gaps in my teeth. I honestly thought it couldn't get fixed. Dr Montano and his team proved me wrong. My smile has never looked this good. I would definetly recommend Dr Montano and Dr Cardall!<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Dr Montano was our orthodontist over 15 years ago for both my kids and did a great job perfecting beautiful smiles.   This year both myself and my adult son found ourselves in need of orthodontic help.  How awesome to see many of the same staff.  Less then a year later, we are both at the finish line !   Thank you for putting up with my complaining and meeting our needs.   Could not be happier !</Review>

I really love my new smile. The doctors are great and very professional. The staff was very friendly. I would recommend Montano Orthodontics to everyone. Their new office is extremely nice. I love their Keurig coffee machine and other beverages that they offer. They also have an arcade for the kids which looks really fun. Overall, I am very satisfied with how my treatment turned out. Thanks for my fantastic smile!</Review>

For a very long time I wanted braces because I hated the way my teeth looked,  I never wanted to smile. One day my cousin told me about Montano & Cardwell so I decided to go for a consultation. That was the best choice I made because not even 2 years later and I have my braces off with the teeth I have always wanted to have!  The whole team in the office are nice and so friendly!  I recommend Montano and Cardall to everyone that want to get braces.  Well worth the money.</review>

<Review>I pursued my orthodontic treatment due to feeling insecure about my own smile and always hiding my teeth from everyone I knew . I never smiled and I never wanted to take pictures . I knew my teeth needed help and I needed to do something about it. My teeth before were crooked and probably the most embarrassing feature about myself . I was so ashamed of my own smile . I chose montano and cardall because of their wonderful ratings and also their smile for a lifetime foundation program . My family wasn’t well off and I wasn’t working yet and I really needed to get braces. Without their program it never would’ve happened . Today I feel absolutely stunning in my own smile. My smile is more beautiful than I could of ever imagined . I never thought my teeth could possibly look this great and be this straight . The team at montano and cardalls office are outstanding !!! They are the most friendliest people you could meet and always take great care of me . I never left unsatisfied . They are the best staff of doctors I have ever come across . I am so happy with their treatment . My advice for others is to not wait to long ! Get braces at a young age and always BRUSH AND FLOSS . Also , braces are going to hurt and take time , but the outcome is more than you could ever wish for .<//Review><GmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /GmapID>< userid>

I just got my braces off today..... And I can't stop smiling! My teeth weren't so bad, but I wanted them straight. I had a boyfriend at the time, who's niece was going to get the metal braces. She was frightened, so I'd thought to get the metal braces right along with her so she can have someone to relate to. I was referred to Montano and Cardall by a co-worker of mine, and it is the best decision I have ever made.The staff was AMAZING! Always so kind and courteous. They always remembered me by my first name, and greeted me with a smile. I never had to wait in the waiting room longer than 5 minutes each time. Once I was in a chair, the assistants discussed everything with me, gave me great tips on how to keep my mouth clean and hygienic, and provided me with an extra equipment I needed free of charge. I never waited an extraneous amount of time for the orthodontist to come see me. They both a very knowledgable, have light hands, and are incredibly kind. Scheduling was SOOOO easy. With work and school, finding time to make my appointments was a huge bear. The staff really worked with me on scheduling as well as sent me reminder calls and texts for my next appointment. For all those wearing braces, MAKE SURE YOU WEAR YOUR RUBBER BANDS! Needless to say, Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists will ALWAYS get a great referral from me! YOU ALL ROCK!!< /Text>

< review>
I started orthodontic treatment when I was 8 years old due to a massive under bite and excessive crowding. Before my first set of braces I was really young but even then I realized that everyone's teeth were growing in straight and mine well, weren't. Set one lased about two and a half years before it was time to let the rest of my teeth grow in; sure enough they were crooked too so I came back for round two. Now, I'm very confident with my smile which rocks because I laugh a lot and having a great smile makes it that much better.
Initially, I started my treatment with Dr. Martz and when he retired he transferred all of his patients to Dr. Montano. I only had about six months left of that set but it was enough time for me to fall in love with the environment and office staff. I came back a few years later and Dr. Cardall had been added to the team; to no avail, he was just as kind as everyone else in the office. My share of time with Dr. Montano and his crew was awesome. I was comfortable and never had any trouble except for soreness but that is to be expected when your teeth are being moved. If I had to do it again I would have started round two earlier because the feeling of getting my braces off was the best feeling. I had straight teeth and no more metal, it rocked; I would never change the route I took with Dr. Montano's office, the experience was 100% worth it.< /review>

Not only did I have really bad teeth but Montanto also helped diagnose other breathing issues I had that doctors had never diagnosed. So because of him and doctor Cardall not only do I have better teeth they we so patient with me and my process and I’m glad I got recommended to Montano & Cardall Orthodontic.</Review>

I had my metal braces on for a year and half a little more than expected as I wasn't fully satisfied with my teeth on what was supposed to be my last visit but the doctors were more than willing to work with me and we're not pushy to have them taken on off until I was fully satisfied. The front desk was especially great they sent me extra rubber bands if I wasn't able to come in and always accommodated me.< /Review>

<Review>My story of why I pursued orthodontic treatment:
I hated my teeth and smiling was very uncomfortable for me. I always smiled without showing my teeth. I finally wanted to do something about it. So, I searched and went around looking for a good orthodontist. Then, a family member of mine recommended Montano & Cardell Orthodontic Specialist.
Shortly after, I scheduled a consultation and they worked with me to set up a monthly payment that I could afford. All of the staff is wonderful. They're always smiling and are very friendly.
If you're out there thinking of getting braces and not sure where to go, choose Montano & Cardell Orthodontics. They really know what they are doing and love what they do.
I am so happy with my decision of going to Montano &  Cardell because I am in love with my smile. It was worth all the pain and patience. Now, I can truly live life smiling (:<//Review>< Pics>

<text>I was referred to Dr. Montano and Cardall from my dentist. After doing some research of my own and reading all the great reviews,  I knew they would be the best choice! I did not like my teeth before I had braces and never showed my teeth when I smiled. I had my braces on for about 13 months and just got them off today. I am very happy and confident  with my new smile! The experience was beyond what I expected. The staff is very friendly, happy, and always helpful. I would highly recommend Dr. Montano and Cardall Orthodontic for anyone wanting the perfect smile. :)<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /GmapID></record>

<Review>Took my daughter to see Dr Montano for her orthodontic care when she started jr high. over time we watched as her teeth shifted to their correct placement showing her beautiful smile.  She has now started her journey in high school and can have a beautiful and confidant smile of her own to share with others.  I”as her mother was a client of Montano’s when I was a kid. I thank my parents for taking me to see dr.montano.  a lot of his same crew work there from when I had gone to his offices for my visits. Im so glad I was able to do the same for my own child.  I do recommend to others and their families to visit if looking for ortho care.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Review>I went to Montano to have an impacted tooth fixed and to have my smile perfected. I was in college out of state at the time and had a difficult schedule. Montano was very straightforward and nice. He was very helpful answering all of our questions. During my treatment I traveled cross country studied abroad, only returning home on breaks, but they allowed me to schedule accordingly. Both Montano and Cardall are very easy to talk to. I had a great experience and now my braces are done and I am very happy with the results.I would definitely recommend this office.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I pursued orthodontic treatment to feel more confident about my smile. Before treatment I felt uncomfortable and shy smiling around my family and friends. Dr. Montano’s long experience and high quality treatment made it easy for me to choose Montano Elevated Orthodontics over others. I feel delighted and confident about my smile now. My experience with Dr. Montano’s team will be a lifetime memory and could not have been more glad for their remarkable work. I advice others to come to Montano Elevated Orthodontics and achieve their smile of a lifetime.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377</Gmap_id><Text>This place is amazing! From the moment we stepped into their office we were treated professionally. My son was the patient, and at 13 years old, Dr. Montano and staff made him excited about getting braces. They offer fun incentives for kids and parents that show up on time for their appointments. There are contests and drawings for both kids and parents. The office has a small arcade, is very relaxed, and comfortable. Every member of their team is caring, informed, and happy to be at work. Dr. Cardell joined the team about half-way through sons treatment and he is a perfect fit for the office. The largest surprise I had was that we were never asked to pay any additional costs. The quote we received in the beginning was exactly what we paid. And they even did little extra things for us, like filing my sons front teeth when he mentioned being self conscious about a chipped tooth. I highly recommend Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardell for any orthodontic service you need. Please don't regret your orthodontic choice, come here instead!</Text>< pictures>

I'm so glad I came to them instead or the doctor who had been working with me before I heard about Montano & Cardall.  The common areas are always well kept and they have coffee, water, and free WiFi while you wait.  They have a points system where you can earn prizes and give you a ton of free stuff. This place is great for kids. IF YOUR CHILD NEEDS BRACES COME HERE. I even received $700 in discounts to handout to friends and family at the end of my treatment.  My teeth look so much better now. Efficiency, excellence, and professionalism. They are specialists who are VERY good at what they do and know how to hire competent and kind staff. Oh, and when I got my braces off it was like a mini celebration (so funny, fun, and cool).<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Friendly and professional atmosphere every time we had an appointment. We are very satisfied with the results. I recommend Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists to anyone needing ortho care. They are very good at explaining every thing plus they go out of their way to make you feel welcome and cared for.< /Review>

<review>Coming into Montano and Cardall, I had a tremendous overbite, a little bit of a cross bite, and some really messed up teeth. In fact, my overbite was so bad every tooth was one tooth further than where they should've been. I felt embarrassed and ashamed to smile or show my teeth in public. Up until visiting Montano and Cardall, my teeth were always something I hid from everyone. I heard some great things about Montano and Cardall, and decided I'd go over to see what they could do about my teeth, because I was tired of waking up every morning and hating my teeth. From the first day I went in and still to this present day, Montano and Cardall and their staff have been nothing short of the friendliest, most caring, talented, patient, and just absolutely amazing team I have ever seen. Every time I had an appointment here, I genuinely was excited to show up because everyone treated me and cared for me so well. Walking in and saying hi to the doctors or the dental assistants or the secretaries never felt awkward, it was as if I was talking to friends I hadn't seen in a while. I have never felt so safe and trusting of a staff in any other place that practices medicine ever. Now, 2 years forward, my braces have just come off, my smile is perfect, and I am absolutely ecstatic about my teeth! It's gotten to the point where I'm feeling that I show my teeth around TOO much now, because I love them so much! I feel like a completely different person, and when I smile it fills me with confidence and joy that I had the pleasure to have been helped by only the best orthodontic team in the world. I would recommend this place 100 times out of 100 to anyone and everyone of all ages, they're easily the best orthodontic specialists available. Now, I really never write reviews online, but seeing how well Montano and Cardall made my teeth look in the end made me so amazed that I felt compelled to write a review for them. Trust me, they really work magic on your teeth and once you see how well your teeth turn out after their treatment, you'll feel like the happiest, most confident person in the world with your new smile.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I had to have corrective jaw surgery and the amount of effort and dedication the whole office gave to give me a great experience was amazing. Each patient becomes part of a family and they devote all their energy into ensuring each person gets the smile that they deserve. I owe my smile  to Montano & Cardall Orthodonics.< /Review>

<Text>Montano & Cardall was the greatest orthodontist experience of my life.  I had braces in my early teens, and like a lot of people I stopped using my retainer over time.  By the time I got into my 30s, I was no longer comfortable with the appearance of my smile, but I wasn't too excited about getting braces as an adult either!  Fortunately, the Invisalign process was super easy and pain free.  Now I am smiling more than ever.< /Text>< username>

<Review>We found out my son Jason needed braces at a regular dental appointment.  At 14 his canine teeth had not come in so the dentist took additional xrays finding he would need oral surgery to extract them and orthodontic treatment to bring the canine teeth down. We visited 3 different offices before deciding on Montano and Cardall. Each location was friendly and all had different pricing. But there was definitely a more warm welcome at Montano and Cardall. Dr. Montano took time out of his busy schedule to meet with us at the consultation and it was great to see local faces on the walls of their office showing off their smiles, post braces! Jason's treatment plan was 24 months from start to finish. Montano and Cardall's office staff are friendly and very accommodating with appointment times to work around Jason's school schedule. They were not the cheapest option, nor the most expensive option, but the right fit for us.  Thank you making my son's smile fantastic.< /Review>< Pictures>

I purchased orthodontic treatment because I wasn’t happy with my smile. I didn’t like me teeth because I had an overbite with cricket teeth. I chose Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall because I was referred to them but I was happy I was! I love my teeth now there so straight I miss my braces but I’ll get used to it. I loved the girls there they are all so nice no one was ever rude always felt welcomed especially by the Drs. Don’t wait for braces come get them done here!< /review>

After taking my son to several consultations, I chose Montano & Cardall and I’m so glad that I did!
My son has a tooth that was injured when he was younger, an overbite, overjet and some overcrowding; all of these issue made it a hard decision on what office to choose. Today he got his braces off and his teeth look great! They were able to expand his bite, correct his bite and all of the teeth that out of place 😊</Text>

If you are looking for an orthodontist, look no further. I was a patient of Dr. Montano as a child and since he still works as an orthodontist naturally my children would also see him. With my second child I was curious about other orthodontists so we saw a few different ones to see the difference. One local reputable orthodontist was extremely arrogant and wanted to charge us $2,000 more than other offices. They then proceeded to call constantly. Another orthodontist in town didn't even look in my child's mouth, just asked her to smile and said "yeah, she needs braces." After these experiences I was positive I have been seeing the best orthodontist in town. This was 2 years ago. My daughter just got her braces off and I couldn't be more pleased. Her smile turned out even more beautiful than I could have imagined. Dr. Cardall is genuine, warm and friendly. The orthodontist's are very skilled in their craft and continue to learn and hone their craft. The office staff is very helpful with any issues that arise with having braces such as poking wires. The office has promotions to win prizes. You are updated on progress at every appointment. My advice to those looking for an orthodontist and looking at all their options available to them is: Pick Dr. Montano and Cardall. You won't be disappointed. Your investment in yourself or your child will be worth every penny spent and more.<//text>

<Text>Going into Montano and Cardall Orthodontics I really don't know what to expect. But little did I know it was a life changing experience. Their staff is very helpful and made me feel that I would be well taken care of. Everytime I would attend my appointments I would never feel scared, nervous, or dreading them. Dr. Cardall and Dr. Montano always took the time to explain the work they were going to preform on my teeth. In the 3 years I was there I never leave disappointed in my smile and I saw improvement right away. My first appointment went well and they took the time to fix every error that was made naturally in my bite. I would like to thank Montano and Cardall and their wonderful staff for giving me the smile I should've been born with.😄< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I recommend Montano & Cardall for being the best Orthopedics. I was very pleased with the outcome of the treatment my son, daughter, and myself was provided.

The reason I went to Montano and Cardall was because my dentist, Dr kent, recomended us. From the first time we walked in I knew we would have a great time there. They gave us a tour of the office and told us everything that we needed to know. My teeth had an overbite and they fixed up my teeth pretty! Smiling is GREAT because I can show off my teeth! The team is unbelievably nice and they made sure i was okay. Montano and Cardall are the perfect people for braces!</review>

They are talented, very knowledgable and extremely caring. I am in my twenties, and for twenty years I was embarrassed of my smile. Now my teeth look absolutely beautiful, and I can't stop smiling. I moved to Sacramento area towards the end of my treatment, but I still finished my treatment with Dr. Cardall. I couldn't trust anyone else with my teeth, and I knew that I wouldn't, and quite honestly couldn't, find better orthodontists.

<text>The reason I pursued othodantic treatment is pretty much what everybody else pursues it for, a perfect smile. Before I had the orthodontic treatment, I was honestly embarrassed of my teeth. When I would smile for a picture I didn’t show my teeth. My family had always said that Montano and Cardall were the best orthodontists around. And les just say they weren’t wrong one bit. The way I feel about my smile now is amazing! I practically want to show off my pearly whites ALL THE TIME! I’m no longer “no teeth” smiling but smiling with the. The team treats you like family and all are very kind. The only advice I can give is to choose them!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377<//Gmap_id><Review>Montano & Cardall is a wonderful orthodontic to go to. When I first arrived there, I literally feel like I was at a hotel. The work place is so clean and welcoming to any age patient. When it's your first time there, they give you a cute little tour of the place. If you have kids, there is a small game room to entertain them. And every so often, they do cool raffles for people to participate in.

As for the employees, they have such nice attitudes to everybody. When you see them smiling, it makes you want to smile as well. Same way towards Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall. Before they check out with your progress. They always greet you by saying your name and a big smile.

As for my treatment, it was a smooth process. I used Invisalign and I LOVED IT! It's perfect for athletics because your gum won't get caught in anything. Only downside is when you have to drink something besides water. You are required to take them off before drinking anything that is not water. Overall, however, Invisalign was the best choice for me. I feel confident with my smile. Also, once you're done with your treatment, they play a small celebration song and give you a small gift.

I highly recommend it to everyone. You won't regret it at all!</Review><username>Catherine Pablo</username>< Rate>

I really love the services my children have received from Dr. Montano's office.  My oldest child received her orthodontic treatment from Dr. Montano in 2002, and we had such a great experience that we came back to the office for my second child's ortho needs.  The staff is professional, courteous and prompt.  I highly recommend Dr. Montano to others.< /Text>

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall are the best orthodontists around. They actually take the time to make sure you have the best smile around. My previous orthodontist always rushed me and I didn't like the results I was seeing. Thanks to Montano Orthodontics and the wonderful staff I now have a beautiful smile! :)< /Review>

Doctors Montano and Cardall are excellent! I was extremely nervous to move forward with orthodontic treatment, but once I started the process, I knew I was in great hands. Everyone in the office is very friendly, and always answered all of my questions, and eased my fears with patience. If any of my family members need orthodontic treatment in the future, we won't go anywhere but to Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists.</Text>

Montano & Cardall Orthodontic is definitely the place to go if you're looking to improve your smile. Everyone there, front to back, from the initial consultation to finish of treatment is friendly, personable, and striving to ensure that you leave with a smile after every visit. I did the Invisalign treatment for 18 months. I absolutely hated my smile before and would go out of my way to only half smile or hide it when I could. My dentist recommended Montano & Cardall, so I looked them up and read great reviews and decided I'd like to use them to transform my smile. Every appointment was smooth sailing even though I was considered a difficult case. I was dedicated to the treatment plan that the doctors put in place for me. It was easy to follow even though some weeks were tougher than others. The one misconception I think people have with Invisalign is that it won't hurt...your teeth a moving so of course it will, but the seeing that movement makes the pain worth it. You can tell that they all truly care about patient satisfaction, they're always asking how things are going or if there is any concerns you have, I appreciated that. I could not be happier with the outcome and now I smile with confidence.<//text>

<Review>I was Referred here by my Dentist and didn't think much of it. but I'm glad I went here now. I never really felt good about my teeth in general  so I opted for invisalign , and after about a year of going here , I have no regrets! . I'm practically done with my invisalign now  and love the way my teeth look and feel. the office Is neat and organized with nice and friendly staff that makes the process more enjoyable. Definitely not what I expected , you guys are Great !

<Review>I have had 3 kids go through braces all of which went to Dr.Montano. Great experience.  My last had the opportunity to also be a patient of Dr. Cardall. I would recommend Montano to everyone.  As a matter of fact a friend took her daughter there as well.</Review><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>106309764700687953539< /UserId.></record></dataset><record>

Dr Montano and Dr Cardall are the best orthodontists around! My son had an extreme overbite and low self esteem before and now he can’t stop smiling! The drs and staff are very friendly and helpful. We will be using them again for our other 2 kids.< /text>

<Review>The actual orthodontists are great. But this place schedules 10 weeks in advance and have too many patients so for an adult patient is impossible to get anything done. I had to reschedule twice cause i have children and work. But then i have to wait ten weeks. So instead of being done in april i wont be done till the new year! I decided to go elsewhere since they cant schedule me again until end of august for just x-rays!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<name>Michelle Melton< /name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>My daughter, Hannah, has been a patient here for just under two years. She always wanted braces because she thought her teeth were "ugly" due to the large gap she had between her top front teeth. She didn't smile much and was very self-conscious. We were referred to Montano & Cardall by a close family friend and we are so grateful! The staff has been great to work with and Drs. Montano and Cardall have been equally great! My daughter just got her braces off and she can't stop smiling. She finally feels she has a smile worth sharing!  Thank you yo everyone at Montano & Cardall for giving my daughter the smile she deserves!<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< date>

My three years at Montano & Cardall Orthodontics was amazing. They did an amazing job on my teeth and everyone there is so nice. They answered all my questions that I wasn't sure about. If you're looking for an orthodontist, I recommend that you choose Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists< /text>

I was recommended to Dr. Montano by different dentist. I was finally sold on going in by a dental hygienist. Her exact words were; " I have never met Dr. Montano but I can recognize his work, it is meticulous." I completed treatment, Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall did excellent work!!!< /text>

<Review>I pursue my orthodontic treatment because they have great staff and service. My teeth before I came to Monto's office were not straight and I wasn't that happy with them. I choose Mantano and Cardall because my brother started with them and my parents loved them. I absolutely love my teeth/smile now, they did amazing. My experience with them was great and I loved coming with them. My advice for others is if your nervous, you have nothing to worry about, they take great care of you!< /Review>< GmapID>

The office is clean and everything is cutting edge. They make it easy to confirm appointments by text or email. My daughters teeth look beautiful. We love it here. This is my second daughter to see this orthodontics office. Both have beautiful teeth now. Thank you.< /Text>< UserId.>

My dentist gave me some recommendations for orthodontists.  I chose Montano and Cardall at first because of their location, and then was very impressed during my consultation appointment. Dr. Montano told me about all the people, that have been treated for the same issues as I had. I later found out that Montano and Cardall are the top 1% in the state for Invisalign care.  After 2 years of Invisalign, I am really happy with my smile. Everyone in the office is very kind and professional.

<Review>Brought my daughter here for a consultation and they were so kind and helpful, especially since we didn't have ortho on our insurance. They had a payment plan that worked for us. She had her braces on for almost 2 years and in that time they kept all appointment times and any issues were always taken care of right away. They were always friendly when we came in and made sure we knew what was going on in her treatment. I love the open feeling of the office, she even got a little disco party when her braces came off so mom's have your camera ready lol</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
Montano & Cardall Orthodontics have been treating my family for a very long time! First, my dad, then my uncle, and now my sister and I have had the pleasure of being treated by two very phenominal orthodontists! I had Dr. Cardall for most of my treatment and I'd say he is a perfectionist! He strived to get my teeth exactly where they should be and even though there was times I practically wanted to rip my braces off myself, I am very happy I didn't because the results are worth the wait! I personally had a great experience! The staff are very friendly and seem to genuinely care about how you are doing!  My dentist recommend I go to an orthodontist and we chose Montano because we already knew they were great. You will not be disappointed if you choose Montano and Cardall Orthodontists!< /review>

<Text>Before braces, I had a severe over bite and an embarrassing gap. I didn't feel comfortable with my smile at all. We were referred to Montano and Cardall Orthodontics (at the time it was only Montano) by our primary dental care. It was a steady process because my teeth were stubborn in moving, but by two years & 9 months my smile was perfected. My overall experience with Montano & Cardall was amazing, they sent me a letter after every visit filled with encouragement regarding my progress. Now that my braces are off I can't stop smiling! I would recommend this dental care to anyone, there is not a smile they can not perfect.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

I needed some orthodontic treatment to ensure that my teeth grew evenly. I was worried that my teeth would not grow evenly. I chose Dr. Montano’s office because my sister had been treated by him in the past. I can smile confidently now. Everyone at Dr. Montano’s office was nice and professional. My advice others to use Dr. Montano’s office because they are efficient and will schedule in anytime you need an adjustment.<//Text>

<Text>My son was very insecure about his smile. So we decided to get him braces. I thought about taking him to a local orthodontics but was recommended to Dr Montanos office. His office is the best with the friendliest staff. My sons smile is amazing he loves to smile and his confidence is through  the roof. I recommend Dr Montano to my friends and family. I am glad I took him to Dr Montanos office. Our visits were quick and pleasant. I give this orthodontics 5 stars for sure.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377</Gmap_id>< pics>

< Review>
Lets start by saying that I am very excited about finally finishing up the procedure.

So I wanted to get my teeth aligned for a long time and when I was younger my parents couldn’t afford it. So it was always put off. Aside from that one of my dentists growing up said to wait until my Wisdom teeth came in so we can see if it'll improve on its own. (It didn’t).
So fast forward a lot of years and now I decided to pursue a treatment for braces but since I’m an actor I needed results fast. My sister had a treatment for 2 years and I knew people who had similar results. So I pursued Invisalign since it was supposed to be faster. I was told by one orthodontist I needed to do some jaw alignment so I was skeptical until I found Montano Elevated Orthodontics (previously Montano & Cardall).

The consultation is what had sold me because of how their results were and the high percentage of success rate. Plus I was given a 12-14 month treatment estimate so I had to say yes. Did the signing and was on board same day as my consultation. The following month I received my trays and it was the beginning to live life smiling!

Throughout the whole process Montano’s Team was awesome. They make you feel welcome the moment you walk in the office. I like their open floor concept. Nothing like a closed off space to put nerves on you.

After the whole process, which literally was only 12-months, Im very happy with my smile. My family and friends love it. I was always smiling even before the treatment and I will continue smiling after like I always am.

My advice for any future patient you gotta live life smiling. Visit Montano for your orthodontic needs. You will not regret it I promise you!

The staff and doctors were knowledgeable and answered my questions so as to have all the information. I felt confident in my decision to use Invisalign instead of traditional braces since both processes were explained. Also, the equipment and technology available for use is the best. I had Invisalign for close to a year and love the results. My treatment did not require extensive correction, but that did not stop the doctors from giving me the best treatment possible. I feel confident in my smile now, and it was due to the great care and attention to the details. I would highly recommend Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall to others.</Text><rate>5</rate></record>

When I first found out I needed braces I was scared out of my mind. I tend to sike myself out a lot even on little things. When I first walked in I felt so scared my stomach dropped and I was speechless. It didn't look bad if anything it exceeded my expectations. When the staff called my name to get my x-ray I almost couldn't move but I had to do what I had to do. After that when they showed me around i was shook. I pictured that there would be a hallway that leads to a bunch of rooms and I would have to stay in one and wait for someone to come. Instead it was a open room with chairs lined up next to each other in a slight arch. Even though I didn't know the kid next to me I still felt safe, knowing that they were going through the same things as I did. I highly recommend Montano and Cardell to people cause the staff and doctors are very nice.<//text>

Once I got my adult teeth in, my teeth became crooked. I used to feel embarrassed and uncomfortable to smile with my teeth. I choose Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall because A few of my friends went there to get braces and gave me good reviews.  Once going there they recommended me with Invisalign and today was the day I got them off. Now, I feel like I could smile all day and perfectly comfortable with my teeth. The staff was incredible they made me feel like I was at home. I believe people should go here in order to get the best smile possible.< /Text>

<user_name>Charlie Price</user_name><review>Best in Bakersfield. These doctors had zero hesitation designing the appropriate treatment that was started for my children in Fresno. Life happens. We moved to bakersfield mid treatment. I have full confidence in this office and both doctors. Clean, modern, respectful atmosphere that is efficient and doesn't waste anyone's time. They are very professional and responsible ethical businessmen in the Bakersfield area. I love both the smiling docs, as do my children. Today was braces off and my daughter who was once teased for her rabbit teeth now has a smile that befitting the princess she truly is. Thank you both doctors.<//review>< pictures>

Montano and cardall is hands down the best orthodontist in town! The doctors and staff there are incredibly nice and talented. Every appointment was always nice and easy going. I started treatment 2 years ago, before braces I was always insecure about my teeth and couldn’t wait to get my braces on. I’m so lucky to have heard about montano and cardall I couldn’t be any happier with my finished results! I love my smile and can not stop smiling. My experience there was great ❤️<//text>

I have taken three of my five children to Dr Montano and Cardall's office.  I love this place!  The staff is very friendly and the Drs. Really know their stuff.  I recommend this place to everyone.  My older two girls went somewhere else and it was such an unpleasant experience that I will only come to Dr Montano and Cardall.< /review>

There was never a problem rescheduling an appointment, and no problem fitting the appointment into my busy schedule. I was embarrassed to smile or to even show my teeth at all, but Montano & Cardall Orthodontic's invisalign fixed me up in no time! I am not afraid to show off my straight teeth, and my beautiful smile, as what their staff told me. The friendly staff at this orthodontic are always positive, and made sure you were comfortable before doing any work. Once again, I am very satisfied with the results from, which i feel, is the best orthodontic in Bakersfield.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /gmapID></record>

Before i got braces i never wanted to show them to anyone bevause they looked bad. So then my dentist informed me about Montano and Cardall and i went to there office a few days later to get braces. Now I can't stop showing them to everyone! The experience here was amazing and the staff was fantastic here!

Three of my children have seen Dr. Montano and Cardall. Could not be happier with the results. Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable. Sometimes when the adjustments were a little painful you could expect a postcard in the mail checking up on you and apologizing for the pain!! Soon we will be starting braces on our 4th child with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall.</Text>

<Review>My name is Pahola  and here is my story. No matter how much I said I didn't care about my looks, I always felt shameful of my smile. I always kept my mouth shut when I smile. I finally decided to received orthodontic treatment because I wanted a changed in my smile. I wanted to feel confident in my smile especially if I wanted to impress someone. I heard about Dr. Montano and Dr.Casrdall through smile for a lifetime foundation. I heard they were the best of the best. I decided to see for myself how good Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall were. I personally don’t like going to any orthodontist dentist but I have to admit I had one of the most fun and best treatment with Dr. Montano and Dr.Cardall. I still remember the first day I walk in , the front desk lady greeted me very cheerful and warmly with a wide smile. She quickly check me in and while I waited for them to call me  she inform me about a game room :) I didn’t wait for long before they call me in. They inform me step by step of the process of my treatment. They ensure me that by the end of my treatment I was going to have a beautiful smile and I believed in them. They took their job very serious which made me fell more calm and at ease. Thank you Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall it was a pleasant experience. I am grateful to have chosen Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall as my orthodontist specialist.<//Review>< Resp>

I've always been self conscious about my smile so I decided it was time I look into getting braces.  I chose Montano & Cardall as they are very well known here in town and I have heard nothing but good things about them.  His entire staff is knowledgeable, professional and very welcoming.  During my initial consultation they went over the pros and cons of both Invisalign and metal/ceramic braces and answered any questions I had.  They take the time to educate you and also make sure they have a clear understanding of what exactly you are looking to achieve.  They understand your time is just as important as theirs and I love that I never have to wait long.  If you run into a problem they are always willing to help (there were several times my Invisalign trays were sharp in certain areas and they would always squeeze me into their schedule to make sure I was taken care of and comfortable).  A year and a half later, I am smiling more now than I ever have.  My daughter is 9 and currently a patient here as well and actually looks forward to her appointments as they have a game room for children and are always doing some sort of raffle/give away.  If you are looking for orthodontic treatment, look no further.  I highly recommend them!<//Text>

My family has had a very positive experience with Drs Montano & Cardell and the entire staff. I was  a patient of Dr Montano years ago when he took over for Dr Oliver. Fast forward a few years, and I brought my oldest son, then other son to Dr Montano. One more left to get braces with the team. Thank you all so much for your caring and treatment of my boys.< /text>

<response>None</response><Text>I really enjoyed my experience at Montano & Cardall Orthodontic. My family has gone through Montano since the 90s and his work is still excellent. It was nice to see a young Orthodontic such as Cardall take such pride in his work. They didn't hesitate to make sure my teeth were perfect when I got them off. Any problems I had they were right on top of it making sure I was takin care of and my braces were back to normal. I'm extremely happy with my smile, so I think its time to go be a model. lol< /Text>< gmapID>

Victoria Hipsher an employee there no matter what always worked on my teeth and did great and no matter how sensitive I was after surgery or before she was perfect she was gentle and would never would rush. Her work ethic and personality are what made me even more excited for my appointments because I was always afraid of the dentist etc.. but she changed that for me and can for you TRUST ME!!!!. Now having my braces removed I'm in love with my smile they did a fantastic job. If your looking around Montano & Cardall are the people to see they will give you the best of the best. Choosing them was a no brainer all my questions, concerns and advice they were able to give to me Thank You Montano & Cardall also Victoria for my smile I can't thank you enough....</Review>< Pictures>

I pursued orthodontic treatment because I wasn't happy with my smile, my teeth were gapped and my overbite was way off balance. People told me I had a pretty smile already, but I wanted to see it myself as well. I heard nothing but good reviews, and my co-worker recommended that I see the Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists. I met with the team and was very impressed by the success pictures they portray around the office. I have had my braces for 2-1/2 years and I love my smile now. The team was always nice, and dealt with every concern I had. I extremely reccomend the Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists because you will love your surroundings, outcome of everything, and family feeling.</Text>

<text>I was referred to this office by many happy customers and my dentist.  They did a great job with the Invisalign.  The office staff is amazing .     We are so happy with the final results.  My son cannot stop smiling now that he is done.    The invisiline was a great experience it took 18 months. I couldn't believe how quick the process was. Both Cardall and Montano took their time with each patient and were very friendly.   Thank you for all the staffs help through each process .</text>< Pics>

<Review>Hands down a great experience.  The Dr.'s at Montano and Cardall are very kind and extremely knowledgable when in comes to orthodontics.  I have been with this office for over 7 years with my three children.  All three kids required different types of ortho services and this office was able to accommodate them all.  The staff employed are all very sweet and professional each and every visit.  We have even had wonderful service after normal business hours with a regular employee who knows our kids.  I would and do recommend this office for any and all orthodontic service needs.  Thanks for being such a great part of our family for so many years.< /Review><name>Jill Furtado<//name>< Time>

<Text>I went to Dr Montano 20 years ago and got braces. Wore them for FOUR long years. Lost my retainer and over the years my teeth got worse. Now fast forward 20 years and Dr M had me in Invisalign for only 8 short months and now my teeth are perfect again! And I'm getting a permanent retainer so no more losing it!! Office visits were always short and sweet. Great experience.</Text>< pics>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall made my wish come true. I had severe crowding on bottom teeth and my top canine tooth was high up which was pretty noticeable when I smiled and for me that was quite embarrassing. I am a person who loves to smile so when it came to pictures I had to close my mouth and when I laughed I would cover my mouth.
One day I was determined to get braces because I was tired of having to hide my smile. I googled the best orthodontic places in Bakersfield and Montano and Cardall popped up. I read the reviews and I immediately knew this place was it. When I showed up for my exam they showed me around and I felt wanted in there. All the staff is so nice and helpful and not to mention how nice the office is.
When my braces came off I was the happiest. I couldn't believe how straight my teeth were. There are no words to describe how content I am with my teeth. I cannot stop smiling because they look great. My friends and coworkers have given me so many compliments. It's just a great feeling.
Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall really are the BEST! I cannot thank them enough for giving me the perfectly aligned teeth I always dreamed of.
For anyone who is looking for ortho treatment I 10/10 recommend Dr. Montano and Cardall.
Thanks to them I will definitely Live Life Smiling< /text><Rate>5</Rate><Date>1504164173467</Date></record>

<review>Where do I even begin?! First of all I want to say that  Dr. Montano & his team are AWESOME...It took me a long time to decide where to begin my journey to a better smile. I had always been very self conscious about my diastema (GAP) and my smile but I am beyond glad I decided to start my Invisalign journey with Dr. Montano... He is by far one of the best orthodontist in town! I am not even half way through my treatment and I can already see just how much my smile has changed. I want to thank Dr. Montano & his team for helping me get the beautiful smile I have always wanted. I truly recommend anyone looking to start Invisalign/ traditional braces to come to Dr. Montano he will not disappoint! Let’s just say I have learned to live life smiling! & I can’t wait to see the end result.< /review></record>

My son has been going to Doctor Montano and Cardall for about a year and a half now and he just got his braces off yesterday!” can I get a WOOP! WOOP!” We both are completely satisfied how his teeth turned out. Before his braces, he had an overbite and many gaps. He can’t stop smiling, he has beautiful straight teeth now. Doctor Montano and Cardall have done an AMAZING job! Everyone in the office is nice is super friendly, and make you fill welcome at all times. We never had to wait more than 15 minutes to seen. If you are looking for great orthodontists go to Montano and Cardall Orthodontic you won't regret it, I promise!< /review>

Montano & Cardall Ortho is the best place I have ever been to! I had very misaligned, crowded teeth and an impacted canine. Dr.Montano & Dr. Cardall formulated a specialized treatment plan for me that was completely invisible with Invisalign, which I was previously told could not be done. It was! I now have a beautifully, straight smile and can feel confident! Thank you ❤️😍😍😍</text>

<Review>All I got to say is that I'm very happy with my out come. I was not happy with my smile even with having prior ortho. The staff and Doctors were super nice and friendly. Never had a problem with any being rude. Really recommend to anyone who is thinking about having ortho to go with Dr. Montano & Cardall.</Review>< Pictures>

I was very satisfied with the progress my teeth made. They treated me like a family friend and they're all very friendly. I even got my braces off 4 months early.<//Text>

<date>1447184543281<//date><Review>I wanted to pursue orthodontic treatment because I was always self conscious about my smile. All throughout my younger years in school I would get made fun of due to my crooked teeth. I hated them, and although my parents would tell me that my teeth didn't define me, society had me convinced it did. I decided to choose Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall because i liked how friendly the staff was & the doctors themselves were also very nice. I feel so much better about my smile now that I had gotten braces, it has definitely boosted my confidence level x1000. My experience with your team was beyond amazing! Everytime i had an appointment the staff was very helpful with reminding me my appointments a day in advanced, and always being polite and having a smile on their face when greeting me everytime I would come in. My advice to others is that if you're ever self conscious about anything and decide to make a change, do it for you. Don't let society be in control and now a days that is very hard. I just want to thank the Montano & Cardall staff for everything they've done for me the past 3 years & I wouldn't want to have it any other way! Thank you so much!</Review><user>113368767116118091098<//user><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend anyone needing braces to go see Dr Montano and Cardall. The staff is amazing, everyone is so nice, happy and always has a smile. I never had a problem making an appt and when my apot came i never had to wait to be seen. They text you the day before to remind you which is wonderful they have an awesome payment plan and they even have a points program for the kids to get prizes. The work they do is amazing so if you want a pretty smile this us the place to go.
Thank you Dr Montano , Dr Cardall, and staff you truely are the best.<//Text>

I had 3 kids get braces here over the last 5 years and every time it was wonderful! One was a thumb sucker, the second grew 5 inches in 2 years and the jaw line was out of wack. The third has 5 missing Permanent teeth.  So it wasn’t just for CROOKED teeth. My kids teeth look great, so glad I chose montano and cardall ❤️< /review>

<text>I found Montano and Cardall when searching for invisalign providers in the area. I had a couple gaps in teeth i was looking to fix, and I didn't want to get braces. They had amazing reviews and lots of experience with invisalign (one of two diamond plus providers in the area), as well as the iTero scanning system. It's been a great experience with them. My teeth look great, the duration of treatment was about what was estimated, and pricing was upfront. They were great with working with me on appointments and rescheduling. The staff and office are amazing as well.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>My experience with Montano-Cardall Orthodontics was exceptional!  Their office is clean, welcoming, and comfortable and their equipment and technology is state-of-the-art.  The office staff and dental assistants are amazing! They’re kind, caring, and knowledgeable.  They always remembered my name, greeted me warmly at each visit, and chit-chatted personably during down times.  I even received hand-written notes in the mail occasionally from them!  They were also affectionate and understanding when my treatment was uncomfortable.  During my time there, Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall proved to be skillful and competent orthodontists.  My case was extremely complicated and required very specific treatment and ultimately jaw surgery.  My upper and lower teeth didn’t line up or meet correctly and caused a major shift that made it very difficult to eat, talk, and even smile.  I was also terribly self-conscious because my face was visibly “crooked.”  Dr. Montano was confident that he could fix it though!  He recommended and worked closely with an amazing oral surgeon, and together they built for me a functional bite and beautiful smile!  There were several orthodontic challenges that Dr. Montano faced along the way, but he persevered and problem solved through them every time.  I was so impressed with his talent and ability, and so pleased with the end result!  Being their patient has been a life changing experience and one of the best decisions I’ve ever made!  I couldn’t be happier with my experience at Montano-Cardall Orthodontics!

<Review>Wonderful facility and employees.  They worked well with my daughter's needs first with invisaline, then with wire braces when she needed to switch due to a cardiac illness.  They're dedication was unending despite the extra time and patience needed and her smile and the confidence to smile that she now has that she didn't is AMAZING!  THANK YOU MONTANO & CARDALL!!!</Review>< pics>

Leevi is our 3rd child to receive orthodontic care from Dr Montano.  From start to finish, Leevi has received expert care!  His treatment was a little more difficult than most and we appreciate the thoroughness of Dr Montano and his expert skills!  Leevi got his braces off today and we (especially Leevi) couldn’t be happier!</text>

After close to 3 years of  Invisalign and a gruesome surgery(I was a pumpkin head for a couple weeks), I'm finally comfortable with my smile. Before, i would never be able to smile with teeth. Now I can. It was a long and expensive process but it was totally worth it. Both Montano and Cardall are really nice and patient. They explain every process and step if you want to know. It was a wonderful experience.</Review>< gmapID>

< Review>
My daughter was in desperate need of orthodontic care. She had stopped smiling when being photographed and she became very self conscious about her teeth. We took her to three different offices for consultations and finally decided to go with Montano Orthodontics. I can not thank the wonderful people at Dr. Montano's office enough. From start to finish, EVERYTHING about Montano Orthodontics was perfect! We could not be happier with the results and the best part of it all, my beautiful, confident daughter loves smiling again =)< /Review>

< review>
I just got my braces off today..... And I can't stop smiling! My teeth weren't so bad, but I wanted them straight. I had a boyfriend at the time, who's niece was going to get the metal braces. She was frightened, so I'd thought to get the metal braces right along with her so she can have someone to relate to. I was referred to Montano and Cardall by a co-worker of mine, and it is the best decision I have ever made.The staff was AMAZING! Always so kind and courteous. They always remembered me by my first name, and greeted me with a smile. I never had to wait in the waiting room longer than 5 minutes each time. Once I was in a chair, the assistants discussed everything with me, gave me great tips on how to keep my mouth clean and hygienic, and provided me with an extra equipment I needed free of charge. I never waited an extraneous amount of time for the orthodontist to come see me. They both a very knowledgable, have light hands, and are incredibly kind. Scheduling was SOOOO easy. With work and school, finding time to make my appointments was a huge bear. The staff really worked with me on scheduling as well as sent me reminder calls and texts for my next appointment. For all those wearing braces, MAKE SURE YOU WEAR YOUR RUBBER BANDS! Needless to say, Montano and Cardall Orthodontic Specialists will ALWAYS get a great referral from me! YOU ALL ROCK!!</review>

<time>1528496343678</time><Review>I pursued my orthodontic treatment due to feeling insecure about my own smile and always hiding my teeth from everyone I knew . I never smiled and I never wanted to take pictures . I knew my teeth needed help and I needed to do something about it. My teeth before were crooked and probably the most embarrassing feature about myself . I was so ashamed of my own smile . I chose montano and cardall because of their wonderful ratings and also their smile for a lifetime foundation program . My family wasn’t well off and I wasn’t working yet and I really needed to get braces. Without their program it never would’ve happened . Today I feel absolutely stunning in my own smile. My smile is more beautiful than I could of ever imagined . I never thought my teeth could possibly look this great and be this straight . The team at montano and cardalls office are outstanding !!! They are the most friendliest people you could meet and always take great care of me . I never left unsatisfied . They are the best staff of doctors I have ever come across . I am so happy with their treatment . My advice for others is to not wait to long ! Get braces at a young age and always BRUSH AND FLOSS . Also , braces are going to hurt and take time , but the outcome is more than you could ever wish for .<//Review><rating>5< /rating><pics>None<//pics><gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377<//gmap_id>< resp>

I cannot say enough great things about this office! We just finished treatment with my 2nd child and have a 3rd child currently in braces. We have ended up with beautiful smiles and couldn't be happier! The staff here are friendly and knowledgeable and the drs are so welcoming and happy to answer any questions about treatment. There are plenty of seats in the waiting room and there are many seats in the treatment room where you can sit nearby and watch what's going on with your child! The office offers many incentives and prizes along the way to keep patients motivated to care for their teeth and braces in the correct way during treatment! There are no hidden costs or extra charges. What you are quoted at the beginning of treatment is what you pay even if treatment ends up being longer than expected! I highly recommend this office!

Update- my daughter and 3rd child just got her braces off and her teeth look fantastic! Montano orthodontics continue to create beautiful smiles. Happy customer over here!</Text>

<Text>Both of my boys had braces prior to my invisaligns. They had a wonderful experience and now have amazing smiles.  I chose to have invisaligns to correct a deep bite. Dr. Montano suggested a second round of invisaligns because the bite was so deep and he wanted to correct it properly. I am grateful for that. My daughter will be going in next week for her consultation.

I would recommend Montano and Cardall to anyone interested.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rate>

Brought my daughter in for a consultation. Was advised of what needed to be done and went over finances. Narce explained to me that they would have to submit for the approval from the dental insurance company. Narce explained it can take 3-4 weeks to get a response. Okay great. My daughter kept bugging me if I heard from the orthodontist office about the approval. Since I hadnt I figured I would call the dental insurance company. This was on Tuesday morning. Insurance advised that it was approved and sent back. I called and advised this and asked to speak to Narce. At that time I was advised she wasnt available and that their fax toner was out so they hadnt received anything as lf yet but she would have Narce call me back. Nothing. No phone call. Called wednesday, thursday, and friday. Wednesday and thursday i was told same thing that Narce wasnt available but they would make sure she called me back that day. Still nothing either day. Today i called and was advised no one was in the office, that they were only there to take phone calls. It is unprofessional to not return phone calls to potential customers.
I never thought I would have this experience at your office since i was a paitent before and had nothing but goof experiences. Now, i have to wait until monday and hope that i get a phone call back.
Hopefully i can update my review and change my rating for better.

Thank you Dr. Cardall and Narce for your due diligence to find out what was going on. Narce, thank you for taking time out of your day when you are off to give me a call to explain what happened. Thank you again! So glad i could update my rating.<//review>

i had braces on from them for a year and a half, i got them off today!! They were accuarate on how long i was going to have them on, i was really happy about that. i really loved the outcome of how nice and shiny my teeth looked after the reveal. everyone there was always super nice and positive to me when i came in to the moment i left. another great thing was they were always on time for my appointments when i came. me and my sister were always able to arrange our appointments on the same day and time so that made it really easy so we didn't have to make two trips all the time. my parents also liked that they had the option of an interest free payment plan, that helped a lot. i liked that they always explained everything to me so i knew what was going on like if my mouth was going to hurt or if it wasn't, overall communication was really clear. i would recommend montano and cardall to everyone!< /text>

<text>From my first consultation, to when I had my last Invisalign tray, Montano and Cardall orthodontics has been nothing other than great!  The whole staff is friendly and polite.  I'm always seen very promptly after checking in for my appointment.

Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall both worked on my case and they were both very knowledgable and enthusiastic with my progress.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience with Invisalign.  I definitely recommend them to anyone in the market for braces or Invisalign.<//text><date>1537377653864<//date><Pics>None< /Pics>< UserId.>

I knew from the start that I wanted invisalign, so I set out and did my research.  I was concerned because I have a bridge, and some receding gum issues. I had three total consultations, and ultimately chose Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists.  Not only because they are rated the top 1% provider of invisalign, but because Dr. Montano was confident that he could address all my orthodontic needs, (severe protrusion of front teeth, and an excessive overlap of the upper teeth over the lower teeth, with both the upper and lower teeth shifted to the right, and both have crowding) with invisalign.  He also showed me a before and after of someone with issues similar to mine, only they were worse off because they had gone to someone who was less qualified and ended  up making their problem worse.  Montano & Cardall were able to give said patient a great smile - I was sold.  After 42 aligners, (being changed out every week), my smile is perfect!  At Montano & Cardell, they deliver!<//review>

<review>My husband, 2 sons & nephew all had braces & Invisilign done by Dr. Montano & Cardall. We have been so happy with the results we recommend them to everyone. My husband was reluctant to get Invisilign but after his treatment his teeth are beautiful & it cured his TMJ. The staff are amazing & we never had to wait when we came in for appointments. I loved how quickly they got patients in & out.  I am the last one in the family to get my teeth straightened & I will definitely be going to Montana & Cardall, they are great at what they do & they're a pleasure to work with.  I highly recommend them.<//review><time>1475692290248</time>< response>

<text>I have been going to Montano and Cardall for a little over a year and a half, my experience has always been excellent from beginning to end. I just today finished my Invisalign journey and couldn't be happier with the outcome my smile looks and feels amazing! Definitely a good place for invisalign with top of line technology. Both doctors are very knowledgable, treat you with great care and are quick to answer any questions. Their staff is very professional also and make you feel comfortable, everyone is helpful and friendly. Their team was very punctual on all of my appointments which is excellent. I highly recommend Montano & Cardall Orthodontics to anyone seeking to perfect their smile their work is great you won't leave disappointed. Thank you Dr. Montano & Cardall and their staff for my new smile.< /text>< gmapID>

My experience at Montano & Cardel was pretty good. I went through 2 phases of braces, for a total of 4 years.  I was 8 years old when I first got them on. The staff was always nice and welcoming. Anytime I had something wrong or a wire poked me, they always made sure I was happy and had no discomfort. If I did have discomfort, they would give me gift cards to Dewars...that was pretty SWEET! There were times the staff would call me after an appointment to make sure I was feeling ok. That always made me happy. My mom & Dad really liked everyone too because they always explained everything to them and they say it was affordable.   At 13 years old, I finally got my braces off and I love how My teeth look!<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>First of all I would like to thank the whole staff of Montano & Cardall Ortho Dental office for the great and excellent work for my son's teeth. I could say my son has a very poor teeth in the beginning, and today, one of the most accomplished day for my son's life, because this is the day that they removed the braces after almost 2 years. And the result was more than excellent. They fixed it in the most appropriate way. That is why we love Ortho dentist.
Let's talk about the staff; they are so efficient, helpful, and gentle on their work. The most important thing, if my son had a problem with his brace, the scheduler accommodated us in the most convenient way. Two thumbs up for that. I trust no one but Dr Montano and Cardall for Ortho Dental works. Well recommended. Thank you and God bless on your business.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>My story of why I pursued orthodontic treatment:
I hated my teeth and smiling was very uncomfortable for me. I always smiled without showing my teeth. I finally wanted to do something about it. So, I searched and went around looking for a good orthodontist. Then, a family member of mine recommended Montano & Cardell Orthodontic Specialist.
Shortly after, I scheduled a consultation and they worked with me to set up a monthly payment that I could afford. All of the staff is wonderful. They're always smiling and are very friendly.
If you're out there thinking of getting braces and not sure where to go, choose Montano & Cardell Orthodontics. They really know what they are doing and love what they do.
I am so happy with my decision of going to Montano &  Cardell because I am in love with my smile. It was worth all the pain and patience. Now, I can truly live life smiling (:</review>< user_id>

< Review>
Montano and Cardell are great at what they do, and are very caring with each individual who comes in. I pursued treatment because like everyone I wanted straight teeth. I never felt confident with the teeth I had before, and my sister also went through their treatment and her teeth came out amazing. I chose Drs. Montano and Cardell because I too wanted those amazing results. Them and their staff took great care of me, and I couldn't be happier with the results. I'm so amazed with my new smile, I feel like a new me. My advice for others is to start young because it makes the person's whole development of growth easier. I wouldn't want to go to anyone else.< /Review>

My daughters perspective: I pursued orthodontic treatment because I felt that my teeth were dreadful, not only did they look but they also felt horrendous. Anytime I smiled or talked, I felt like no one was paying attention to me. It made me feel like people only focused on how dreadful my teeth appeared. I felt ashamed to be so young with a ghastly smile; they were unappealing to anyone who saw my widely gaped, crocked teeth, and an unscrupulous overbite. I chose Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall because when we first walked in for the initial consultation, the staff greeted us with great service and the doctors were very knowledgeable and qualified to take care of my teeth. We chose to stay there because of the wonderful experiences like: free costume parties at Rollerama, earning points for cool prizes, and a BODACIOUS game room. It turned out to be an astounding experience. They fixed my teeth within two years and now I'm confident about my smile. Since getting my braces off, it has boosted my ego and now I feel great talking to people. I'm not embarrassed to talk or smile! I had fun and enjoyed going to all my appointments and seeing the same welcoming faces. My advice to my future BRACEFACES' is to have patience with the process of getting/having braces. Even though it seems like a long journey; however, it's worth gaining self-assurance. After the journey, you will join a secret society of people with impeccable smiles!</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>From the moment you step into Montano & Cardall Orthodontics you know you are getting the best possible care for your pearly whites!  Montano's office and staff are fantastic and make you feel welcomed and valued every step of the way.  While their services may seem costly compared to other offices, you definitely get what you pay for, and that is evident in every aspect of their business.  In addition to the first rate orthodontic service itself, their office offers the little amenities that may seem trivial to some, but mean a lot to someone who enjoys great service.  These include: coffee, citrus infused water, wifi, arcade room for the kids, amongst other things.  Most importantly, after my son's treatment, I am certain they can take on the most difficult of orthodontic problems.  I am absolutely satisfied with my investment, both with my treatment and my son's.  If you are considering orthodontic treatment, there is no question that Dr. Montano's office is the best choice in Bakersfield.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Getting my teeth straightened using the Invisalign method at Drs Montano and Cardall was the best gift I have ever given myself.  The procedure was a lot easier than I expected.  And now I hear it is even easier because you won't have to have molds taken of your teeth to create the Invisalign retainers.

I could see the alignment of my teeth change quickly.  I no longer try to keep my lips together when I smile!  When I look back at pictures of myself before the alignment, I can't believe how much improved my smile looks.

You are never too old to get this done - I was in my 50s.  The staff at Montano & Cardall Orthodontic make the whole process very pleasant and enjoyable.< /Text>< Pictures>

Dr Montano and Dr Cardell are awesome Orthodontics. The whole staff was always attentive and very welcoming as soon as you came into the office. My daughter Gabriella Perez loved going into the office cause she never had to wait long, unlike other offices.  I would highly recommend Dr Montano and Dr Cardell. Thank you soooo much for her beautiful smile.</text>

<Review>After two and a half years of having braces i finally got them off today. When i first got them on my smile was horrible my teeth were extremely crooked. I choose Dr. Montano& Cardall because Dr. motano had put braces on my brother in the past and he had great reviews. They also have the best and nicest people working there. I honestly didn't hate going there because of how nice and talkative the people who work there are. Before I hated my smile and never wanted to show my teeth. But now i'm excited to show off my new and straight teeth. I appreciate all the hard work and effort they put in my teeth. Thank you so my Dr Motano & Cardall!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da339c7ba5:0x3d802f6b6263a377< /Gmap_id><date>1453928102900<//date>< pictures>

I loved every thing about this office and everything that they do. Every single person that works here is always very polite and helpful in situations and making sure I did what I was supposed to. They never got mad at me for breaking all of the herbst appliances that I had for a few months and that was a stress reliever haha. The office is always super clean and they gave me the best smile I could ask for and I'm so thankful for that! You guys are by far the best office that anybody could ever go to have braces! I will defenitely show off my smile to everybody and tell people about you guys! Thank you again for everything!!!< /review>

<text>Dr. Montano is the best orthodontic doctor in Bakersfield CA.  He has done an amazing job creating my smile with the help of Dr. Cardall and Dr. Relle.  Whether you are a child or an adult, his stellar team will be there every step of the way.  Dr. Montano and his team have become family.  I definitely would recommend anyone for his services.  I am very grateful and proud to say that he is my Dr. of choice.  There should be more stars to give Dr. Montano.

With all the love and respect,

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I started orthodontic treatment when I was 8 years old due to a massive under bite and excessive crowding. Before my first set of braces I was really young but even then I realized that everyone's teeth were growing in straight and mine well, weren't. Set one lased about two and a half years before it was time to let the rest of my teeth grow in; sure enough they were crooked too so I came back for round two. Now, I'm very confident with my smile which rocks because I laugh a lot and having a great smile makes it that much better.
Initially, I started my treatment with Dr. Martz and when he retired he transferred all of his patients to Dr. Montano. I only had about six months left of that set but it was enough time for me to fall in love with the environment and office staff. I came back a few years later and Dr. Cardall had been added to the team; to no avail, he was just as kind as everyone else in the office. My share of time with Dr. Montano and his crew was awesome. I was comfortable and never had any trouble except for soreness but that is to be expected when your teeth are being moved. If I had to do it again I would have started round two earlier because the feeling of getting my braces off was the best feeling. I had straight teeth and no more metal, it rocked; I would never change the route I took with Dr. Montano's office, the experience was 100% worth it.< /Text>< Pictures>

My older brother already had braces, and I thought it was the neatest thing that he got to choose colors to put onto his brackets. I had my braces on for a little over a year, and it was a relatively pain-free experience. Of course, getting wires tightened and teeth molded wasn’t enjoyable, but the staff at Dr. Montano’s was always helpful and kind. Also, the points that patients earned towards prizes was always exciting. Now, I am not afraid to share my smile with everyone. I advise whoever is interested in a nicer smile to come here; definitely worth it!<//Review>< Pics>

I got my first set of braces from an orthodontist in Encinitas, and the braces themselves did what they were supposed to. When I moved to Bakersfield and switched to Montano & Cardall Orthodntics, there was an obvious upgrade in not just the braces themselves, but in the care and professionalism in the workplace. The orientation offered to me when I walked in with my dad my first day there made it very easy for me to forget about my aversion towards doctor appointments. I've been treated by Dr. Montano for a few years and he makes the process of having braces very easy to understand-- even for someone with previously zero knowledge of orthodontia. Walking into the office, I'm always greeted warmly by whoever was at the front desk, and when I'm seated, whoever happened to be working with me that day always made an effort to make me feel at east. After a few appointments, that wasn't even necessary anymore; I'd walk in confident that I'd be receiving the best care possible. I was initially very worried that I'd be stuck wearing braces for a very long time because of my existing facial deformity, but I just recently had my braces removed and I've never felt more confident and happy with myself. I owe a lot of my newfound confidence to Dr. Montano and the team. I would highly recommend switching here for your orthodontic care if you haven't already.< /text>

My experience w/Montano & Crandall Orthodontic was amazing. They answer all your questions & any concerns  you may have. They know how to take care of their patients/clients the minute you walk in to there office. The staff there are fantastic and beautiful from the inside & out.  My daughter felt very comfortable & most of all not scared. Now she cannot stop smiling. She has a beautiful smile.  I WILL highly recommend my family & friends  to Montano & Crandall Orthodontic.  #KEEPUPTHEGOODWORK<//Text>

This will be my second time coming to dr. montano .my 1st time was when I was younger to correct my over bite and Put braces on.This time around it was because of baby teeth being pulled and having the adult teeth missing . I had started my braces at another doctors out of town . When I moved back montano was able to take over . The staff is awesome  and always willing to answer any questions I had as well as explaining what was going on that day . They offer up drawing for the kids and Many other thing to make it friendly and fun . This place is not only for kids but adults too.

When I first decided to get braces I immediately knew I wanted to get my consultation with Dr. Montano (before I knew he had collaborated with Dr. Cardall). I had the advantage of Dr. Montano's amazing work because my brother had gone to Dr. Montano many years ago, when he was off of the Stockdale location. On the up side I also had my niece that had just received her invisalign procedure months before I decided I even wanted braces or even invisalign. Anyways, I went for my free consultation and found out I had way more work on my teeth than what I had even been aware of. I was a bit distraught being told I needed braces because my teeth were way more messed up than what I knew. Deep down I truly wanted invisalign but unfortunately I wasn't a candidate for them. I eventually decided to fix my imperfect smile with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall; knowing what I know now about them, it was the best decision and investment I had ever done. Weeks after weeks, I knew exactly what was going to be my procedure and be aware of what I needed to do in order for me to be successful in my journey. The staff was outstanding, I did have one staff member that would unintentionally forget about cutting my wire every time I got my braces tighten, other than that she was just as great as any other staff. EVERYONE was beyond friendly and too kind. Any question or concern I had they were always there to clarify it all. Now Dr. Montano and Cardall they were two impeccable Dr's. that genuinely love their career. They are truthfully the best orthodontic Dr's. I never write reviews but for Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, and staff I definitely will! Thank you so much Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall for all the work you've done to perfect now my imperfectly smile before!!< /review>

My experienced with the Invisalign braces was great I love how my smile looks now !! :) The reason why I needed to get braces was because I wanted a better looking smile & I didn't like how I would smile before . I would feel that I didn't have a really good smile . Before I wouldn't really smile with my teeth I wouldn't really show them as much because I didn't like my smile . The reason why I chose Montano & Cardall orthodontist specialist was because that's where my dentist referred me too . I honestly love my smile now I'm so glad I got this treatment I had the Invisalign teen & they were great !! I also have been thru a lot with my treatment such as getting jaw surgery. Getting my wisdom teeth out. But at the end it was all worth it I couldn't have had a great beautiful smile with out the best specialist out there Dr montano & cardall. & I love the staff out there too they are so great and really nice & they will help you get a beautiful smile so If you need any braces or your thinking of getting some go there you wouldn't regret it you will love it (:< /text>

My experience with Montano & Cardall Orthodotics Specialists was amazing. I have never met a very welcoming and nice team like team. Before I got braces I have to say my teeth were not in the condition. I didn't like to smile at all especially I didn't like showin my teeth. My aunt kept telling me if I wasn't happy that I should go get checked to see if I needed braces. At first I was nervous but the people there were so loving and caring. That is when I knew this was the place. I had my braces on for 2 years and after I got them off I was relieved but happy because I was in ove with my smile. As soon as I got them off I couldn't stop smiling. If you think you need braces go get checked because if you do need them after you get them off you won't regret it. Throughout everything Montano & Cardall Orthodontic Specialists have  been ver nice and helped me get a better smile.</Text>

Quality Excellent
We chose Dr. Montano as our children's orthodontist. We have been so pleased with the excellent care that both of our boys, and our daughter have received at Montano Orthodontics for the past 4 1/2 years. We really feel like the office staff are more like family to us. We have received exceptional care and follow up. We have been so pleased with the addition of Dr. Cardall with Dr. Montano, and feel he has also provided us with exceptional care. Whenever we had a problem, we were always able to be seen ASAP to fix a broken bracket or to fix a wire. The treatment my children received produced some beautiful straight teeth and a great smile. Our daughter has been monitored since she was 7 years old, and wears a retainer to correct her overbite until she gets her braces. Our children enjoy going to their appointments and are treated so kindly, and receive exceptional care. We are also grateful for Lindsey, Penny, Mary, David and the many other experienced staff that have helped our children. We received education from the qualified staff of why they had to wear retainers & rubber-bands, countless postcards reminding the kids to wear their retainers, and personalized care. Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall make you feel great about yourself and your smile. It is really rewarding to get your braces off, and have your picture with one of them, & receive a your reward from them with some balloons. We are so glad we chose Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall for their expertise in the field of orthodontics. We recommend them highly. We also really like the new office located at 1010 Calloway Drive Suite 200 A in Bakersfield, CA. We would like to thank the whole team for their help!

Thanks so much!!!

When I was 17 years old I had my wisdom teeth taken out and through the passing of time I saw and felt that my teeth were starting to move. I was not happy. I knew that they would only get worse because once one moved the rest would start getting out of place as well. I felt like my future looked tarnished. Any time I smiled I would feel self-conscious of my teeth. I was worried that they would get more out of place or even fall off.
I started looking around on the internet and I read about an Orthodontic treatment that was using new technology that wasn’t invasive called invisalign. So I looked for dr.’s in Bakersfield who used that treatment and found Dr.’s Montano and Cardall who were rated as the best in this field, the # 1 in the county and were up to date with the newest technology. So I made an appointment and from the first moment I stepped into their offices I was impressed. Their office is so modern and well kept. The people working there were so kind and polite. They explained everything form the 1st moment. My treatment lasted 2 years using Invisalign. They gave me all the options possible for payment and I felt very at home with them. I knew I could ask any question’s I had and they would answer them in a way I could understand. I felt very comfortable and like I could really trust them. I knew my treatment was in the best hands.
I can only encourage others to consider Montano & Cardall. They are the best.<//review>

<text>I decided to pursue orthodontic treatment because like most people, I hated my smile. One day my dentist told me about a “cheaper” version of Invisalign called Clear Correct. So of course like anyone would I wanted to save money so I chose Clear Correct. My dentist told me it was exactly like Invisalign and I wouldn’t have any delays. To my understanding at the time my dentist was more than capable to do orthodontics because he told me he could. But he was completely wrong. I spent over a year doing orthodontic work with my dentist to little success. One day I found out that my dentist had sold his practice and moved out of town and he gave my case to Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall. I went to my first consultation with Dr. Montano and quickly found out the dentists are NOT orthodontists. They take some classes in college in orthodontics but they are not a specialist. Dr. Montano & Dr. Cardall were very eager and happy to help me as I was upset that I was mislead by my dentist. The entire staff at Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall’s office are the friendliest and welcoming staff I have ever encountered. I would highly suggest them to any one. My advice for anyone is to never go through your dentist for orthodontic work. Go to an orthodontic specialist. They are certified in just orthodontics and will give you the best result, especially at Montano & Cardall’s office.<//text>< Rate>

<text>I had a wonderful experience working with Dr. Montano and Dr. Cardall's team.

When I relocated from Washington State 2 years ago, I was wearing bonded brackets and not sure if I wanted to switch to Invisalign.  Dr. Montano facilitated my decision making which resulted in decreased frequency dental decay and abscesses because wearing Invisalign facilitated my oral hygiene, aside being pain free from mouth sores due to the oral contact with wires/hooks and brackets.

I find every member of the team very supportive and professional throughout my 2 year treatment period.

From Dr. Montano's facial /verbal expression and demeanor, I can tell that Orthodontics is not just a profession but also his passion as well.  He took his time and gave an artistic touch during my treatment.

I'm glad Dr. Caldall joined the team recently so more people in the area can have more chance to shine with their smile.

Thank you all for the fabulous job you are doing for the community!

I would like to thank everyone at Montano's for their hospitality and professionalism.  Always greeted with a smile from the moment you open the entrance door to the time we head out.  I am very inquisitive so I tend to ask lots of questions (most of the time they are the same questions), and they are always answered with a kind smile over and over.  The best part is that my kids love to go and they feel very comfortable.  They trust the staff and greatly appreciate Dr. Montano's humbleness.  They walk out the office saying "I like Dr. Montano."  My kids are seeing the difference in their smile and they love it.  They did miss the previous play area, but they still enjoy their overall experience at Dr. Montano's.   I highly recommend Dr. Montano's office.   :)<//text>

I am so pleased we were directed to Montano's office. My son, Jacob had his braces put on at the age of 12 and enjoyed every single visit to Montano's office for the next 2 years there after. The staff are all so very friendly just as DR. MONTANO & DR. CARDALL! They talk to their patients to establish a great connection, take the time to get to know you....it brings such a family like atmosphere to their office. my son just had his braces taken off and he is so excited and proud of smile - its priceless. It's amazing how straight teeth changes the way you feel about your smile. Mom's next in line and I wouldn't go anywhere else but to Montano's Orthodontic.  I can't wait to experience the same excitement with my treatment.
A big thanks to Dr. Montano, Dr. Cardall, & all the staff! .....

Montano Orthodontics created a family enviorment for my daughter when she started this process 5 years ago.  She had to have extensive work done on her teeth to get them the way they look today.  This is the most professional, friendliest, cleanist, and welcoming orthodontics firm that you will ever find!  They treated my whole family with respect and really worked with the financial part of it as well as the appointments to try and accomodate our work schedules.  My family has a background of denistry so when I moved here from the Bay Area, knowing that our kids would need braces one day I searched and interviewd over 10 orthodontics firms, and was most comfortable and pleased with Montano Orthodontics! We highly recommend Dr. Montano and staff and we will be sending our youngest there when it is her turn.  When it comes to having that perfect smile for adults or kids, you get what you pay for with Dr. Montano.  He and his staff are truly remarkable  and I would never go anywhere else. I may even get braces for me when my kids are done!</Text>
