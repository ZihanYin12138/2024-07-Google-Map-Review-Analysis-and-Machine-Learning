The absolute best!  Plus the prices AFFORDABLE . I think it's because they make everything on site.  My wife and I could not stop eating!! We wish they had ALL YOU CAN EAT!....but then we would never leave.</text>

Okay I'm shocked this doesn't have AT LEAST a 4.7 so I had to leave a review. It should be closer to 4.9- Absolutely the best vegan sushi I have ever had!! I've tried a whole handful of vegan sushi spots including Now Sushi in Mission Bay and Kensho in OC. The Yasai is super creative in their usage of veggies and fungi rather than relying heavily on imitation seafood and that is what sets it apart. The prices are reasonable for what it is, the decor and ambiance is wonderful, and the service was EXCELLENT. Go asap!!!! (I was too excited to eat the subsequent rolls I ordered so this was the only one that got photographed.)<//text>

< Review>
The food is fabulous. The sushi is incredible. So I’ve said food is spot on now let’s get to their new policy.  The GIANT flaw I  encountered (this is new) is when you call to make a reservation (for 3 people for a Tuesday night) they want your credit card information so they can charge me some mystery fee if you are a no show.  Again this reservation was for 3 people for a Tuesday night not 10 people on a Saturday and the person on the phone had no idea what would be charged to my card.  Are you kidding me...?  what a first impression to give to potential customers.  I’d rethink this policy management.  I declined and booked a table at a different vegan restaurant.</Review>

<Text>Great food but terrible customer service. Their poor customer service seems to be a common theme upon their poor reviews.
Everything we ate was great and I would highly recommend the brussel sprouts. The reason I did not rate this restaurant higher was due to issues with the manager.
The night we went the restaurant was busy and the service was pretty slow, which was understandable,  but what really bothered us was the unprofessional way they handled forgetting one of our orders. After waiting a while for our food and then finishing our meal, the waitress brought our check and I pointed out that we never got one of our orders which was fine, we just wanted it reduced from our bill. At this time our meal was over and it was time for us to move on with our night. She was understanding and removed it but then 3 minutes later as we were about to leave, she told us that the manager is requiring us to pay for the roll and will bring it to us. We would have gladly taken the roll earlier but at this time we were done with dinner and expressed our feelings that since this was not brought to us at the appropriate time we no longer wanted the roll.
This is a common mistake that happens with restaurants but not once has a  restaurant required us to pay for the meal after we already finished our time there and paid our bill.  After asking to speak to the manager, the waitress informed us that the manager would not come out to talk to us.  We were then guilted into paying for the roll as the waitress appeared very concerned about getting in trouble if we did not take it.

This restaurant would be great but needs a new manager!
I would have came back here again if it weren't for the issues with the manager which appears to happen frequently as stated in other reviews.< /Text>< pics>

HORRIBLE customer service. I made a reservation for a table for four. The gentleman who took my reservation asked if I wanted to sit inside or outside. I said inside and when I arrived early for my reservation they said I would be sitting at the bar. It was a special occasion so I did not want to be sitting side by side because it would be hard to conversate. I spoke with the front end manager, who was a short hispanic woman, and she was very rude. She did not apologize or try to accommodate. In fact, she argued with me. There was a table outside that was empty for over a half hour but she said she couldn't put us there because we requested to sit inside. I then asked for upper management's phone number. I called him three times and each time it went straight to voicemail. His voicemail was full so I was not able to leave a formal complaint. I was trying to avoid writing this but since they did not answer the phone, I decided this was the best way for them to address the issue.< /review>

It was quiet and small but the restaurant is very nice and clean. We liked the atmosphere and everyone there was friendly and accommodating. They explained the menu very well and answered questions. Everything we ate was so good! Starting with the vegan dumplings and then we got four of the sushi rolls which were all great. Some of them came with tofu/mushrooms while others had “no shrimp” or “no crab” and they wouldn’t tell us exactly what was in it. It definitely had the same texture as the real thing! We will definitely be going back!< /text><userid>110734816135888724737<//userid>< rate>

Our first time at Yasai was nothing but magical!! Ambiance, lovely staff, super amazing Chef and delicious food!
We had pretzel slider, two rolls and ramen - more than enough to share between two people. As vegan person I couldn't be more happy with the menu but I am sure that everyone can find this place a true piece of heaven.
So much love put into this place 💕
Will be back for sure🤗<//text>

Great ambience and have a separate sushi bar where people can see while sushi is in making...a bit expensive but all their food items are very tasty!< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I had the worst dining experience in my life tonight due to an extremely defensive and rude hostess.  I made it a point of mine to regularly order takeout and patronize the Yasai to do my part to support local business, especially plant-based restaurants, which are going through a rough time during COVID. I even celebrated my 37th birthday here in November and my waiter was nice enough to store my birthday cake in their refrigerator. In all, I would estimate that I've patronized this restaurant roughly 20+ times. However, today was unlike any other time that I tried to order food. My date and I arrived at 6:30 PM at the Yasai on India Street and asked for a table for 2. For instance, the inside of the restaurant was full, which is a violation of COVID restrictions. Nevertheless, the outside only had one table occupied with the other 6 or so others open. The hostess said, "We don't have any seating available." I then asked how many reservations were booked and whether there was an opening soon. The hostess said, "We have an opening at 7:30." I then asked, "It's 6:30 now. Did anyone no show because there's seven seats available based on the tables." She said, "We can't be congested due to COVID." I then said, "Aren't the tables outside already socially distanced?" Then my date said, "We'll take the 7:30 time slot." The hostess then said, "Actually, we have the right to deny service. You can eat elsewhere. Have a good night!" I then asked if I could speak to the manager. Then she walked away. She comes back about 2 mins later and says, "My manager is unavailable." I said I'll wait. She then leaves again to go to the kitchen in the back of the restaurant where I can see her talking to a chef in a white hat. The hostess then returns to us in the front and says, "My manager said I'm the supervisor." I then said, "So now you're the manager or are you the supervisor? How do you supervise yourself? My date then asks her what her name is. The hostess says, "I don't have to tell you my name." Then walks away yet again! At this point it was apparent to me that the staff here provided no information to the public nor was there any visible food licensing permits, legible COVID reopen plan, or business permits. In short, there is no point of contact name or contact information displayed for patrons to even report complaints such as this, so the hostess refusing to even provide her name and her failure to bring a manager to hear my concerns is apparently business as usual. Therefore, I will never spend another dime here and encourage you to do the same.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

10/10!!! Vegan or not you will enjoy the delicious food here guaranteed. I’ve eaten here enough times with my boyfriend that I can confidently say everything on their menu is thoughtfully created, flawlessly executed, and satisfies my sushi and ramen cravings 100%! My favorites are the black garlic ramen with kale noodles, tomato broth ramen, and literally any of the sushi rolls. So Bomb! One of my favorite restaurants in San Diego!< /Review>

I have ordered 4 times. Always get there by the time it says order will be ready. End up waiting an additional 15-20 minutes. Food itself is great.</text>

Great vegan sushi.

Try the spider roll!  It’s so good.  Brussel sprouts, gyozs, sliders.  Yum!</Text>

<Review>I was catching a flight and took my friend here as thank you for the ride. I had no idea it was Vegan and almost left but I am happy I didn't. We both enjoyed the differant rolls alot. Atmosphere was nice and clean and food came out fast and very beautiful. I love actually sushi with fish but I would recommend giving this a try, it felt healthy and light. We had the California, shrimp tempura and crunch roll with edamame. They serve regular and purple rice, we opted for purple. There are a lot of other options on their menu as far as grill and curry i believe but from what we had, we both enjoyed it and were happy we stayed to give it a try.< /Review><GmapID>0x80d955537fee0589:0x9a847931a717b1ac</GmapID>< Date>

Worst service of my life. And I used to work in the restaurant business and have seen seriously bad customer service. Don’t bother spending your money here unless you like to pay to be treated poorly.</Review>

I was excited to try this place and went there with my wife and mother. My mother ordered a ramen, while my wife and I ordered 3 rolls to share. My mother's ramen came out in about 5 minutes, and was pretty good...all down hill from there. We proceeded to sit in the near empty restaurant for over an hour for our rolls to arrive, even though we were at one point the only ones in the restaurant.

When we asked our server about the long wait we were told that there were many to go orders to be made and only one person making rolls, and that we had to wait for the to go orders because they were concerned about not meeting the to go delivery deadlines. When we asked about "but what about the people that are actually at your restaurant?" we were met with a shrug and told to wait another 15 minutes.

About 25 minutes after that, when my mom went in to ask what was going on, she was rudely told she needed to be patient and that this "isn't fast food"

Such high hopes for this fun menu, but unfortunately the lack of understanding in how to do table service, combined with the rude dismissal of our concerns will keep us from ever going back or suggesting it to anybody.<//Text>

Worst service ever. The woman who works there, she is so rude. When we asked her about the service, she said “this isn’t McDonald’s. It’s not fast food.” DO NOT go here unless you want mediocre food and to be treated horribly.</review>

Phenomenal food, healthy and delicious! I'm also impressed with the value for such high quality. $15 buys a nice portion of ramen and a roll.< /review>

Special occasion? I would definitely recommend here! 10000000%!

My partner and I celebrated our anniversary today at the Yasai and had the most amazing experience. We just had to share how good it was! First of all, when we called to make a reservation, the server asked if it was a special occasion, so we told her what we were celebrating. When we got there, we were seated immediately and greeted by the friendliest server. At our table, they had laid out vegan treats compliments of our day!! I was so blown away. But it didn't stop there. 🤚 We began with a lil bowl of free edamame, also. They have beer, wine, and sake to choose from in terms of alcohol. For food, they have a wide selection of Japanese cuisine: gyoza, ramen, karaage, sushi, and more! Every dish had a large, amazing flavor palette; they even had sushi with impossible meat in it! My personal favorite was the karaage appetizer. The presentation of each dish was so so pretty as well. If you go for a special occasion, they may even have flowers for you. At the end of our meal, the server presented us with two free wraps, compliments of the chef. 👩🏻‍🍳 It felt like the perfect end to our special day, and I would recommend this place to anyone.<//text>

< Review>
Horrible! It was one of the worse experience I have had in a restaurant. We sat waiting for our dinner for over one hour..and when I asked the waiter, than later the manager how come we didn't have our sushi-dinner served  over one hour in an empty restaurant... I was treated with condescension and the answer was- " You have to wait with patience because we have other orders in front of you, and we have only one chef."   I said - but the restaurant is empty.
He said they had take out orders..  he also said with annoyance to me, The Client -  "You are in a restaurant, this is not a fast food place!".
Wow. Horrible service, real bad, by the staff, and the management. A shame.
I will never go back there.  Terrible experience. They made us wait for over one hour for sushi in an empty restaurant, while they served the  take-out dinners first.. and they still treated us bad for asking to be served properly.
I don't recommend it at all.  Unbelievable!<//Review>

<text>I rented and took my family out to see the holiday lights just after Christmas.  They were super organized, super helpful, our reservation had to be reschedule due to rain, but it was very easy.  The boat was in great condition and worked perfectly.  The deck hands were polite and helpful.  A great operation and a great experience!</text><resp>None<//resp>< Pictures>

Money well spent. Such a memorable experience. We took the pizza cruise for lunch on Mother's Day. The food from Domenico's was delicious and plentiful. There were only 9 in our party so we had plenty of elbow room and a lot of extra food. The 1/4 tray substitution of pasta for a large pizza was way larger than I imagined. I highly recommend this cruise for group dates or big family adventures.<//Review>

Really enjoyed the duffy boat rental here.  The team was great helpful courteous and very safety conscience.  Price was very reasonable compared to some of the other places in the area.  I would recommend this company.< /review>

<Review>So we came to do boating today and experienced some pretty poor customer service. We rented a paddle boat and got over to the rental and were rudely told that we would need to rent a second boat in order to take our 9 month old infant out on the water who would be sitting in our lap. We were pretty upset with the service and just asked for a refund then and they proceeded to try and say that there was no way for us to get a refund. Needless to say it was a disappointing trip out to Tempe Town. Would not recommend to anyone.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Resp>None</Resp><Rating>1< /Rating><review>From the start to finish of our boat rental experience it was awful. Staff was not very friendly or helpful with the check in process. Once we go to our boat most things on it we’re broken run down and ghetto. As we got on the boat it was not clean seats were dirty table had food and sticky drink on it from the last person. Clearly was not properly sanitized in between uses which with the current COVID-19 PANDEMIC is a huge health concern. Overall I strongly urge everyone to rent from another company seeing how there are plenty of other options in the Newport Bay Area!<//review>< time>

Terrible customer service. We went paddle boarding and kayaking but they didn’t have enough kayaks. They were frustrated at us about it and they were inconsistent with their info. They were even talking about us in front on us. We received an extra charge on their end that I had to call for, they accidentally charged us again. At the end, we were docking and one of the employees pulled us up from the paddle board. They didn’t warn me or tell me what to do leading to me falling of the board and banging myself up on the way down. I ended up getting a few large bruises. To be completely honest, I will never go there again. There was just too much stuff that went wrong.</Text>

We had family coming from out of town to celebrate my moms 60th birthday (which is tomorrow). This place just cancelled on us, the night before at 7:30pm , because their boat has issues that can’t be repaired. “There’s nothing they can do”. The guy on the other line was very nonchalant about canceling our booking. Now we have to scramble last minute to make other plans for my moms birthday. We won’t be able to find any boats now at the last hour. Very disappointed and won’t ever be giving them our business again.< /text>< Name>

<Text>Very nice experience. Boats are in good shape, clean and taken care of, and the location is perfect. A word of caution: go with enough time prior to the boat ride because finding parking can be difficult (especially on weekends). Also, stay in course and make sure to return the boat on time as they have very steep penalty fees for delays (even 15 min would cost you $100), but it's all explained before taking off and in the written in the consent agreement that you sign.

Highly recommended, and pricing is fairly competitive compared to other nearby options.</Text>< Pics>

<review>This is my first time to write a review because they are the worst. They really have a bad customer service and would not help you with anything. Please as an advice, don't waste your time and money. There are many different places other than this with great customer service. Also if you're little late they will give your boat to someone else and not refund you a penny.</review>< date>

I came here because I had a Groupon for a double kayak, but since it was so busy, they ran out. The guy let me have two single kayaks and honored the Groupon. This review is for the gentlemen who work here, they are so kind and helpful< /text>

worst customer service I have experienced so far !
Nowhere on their website was listed that you need to pass a test to be able to rent a boat (you don‘t need to have a boat driving licence).
Instead of explaining the rules and basics  to you again, if you don‘t drive often but it would not be the first time, they expect you to know things you may not know if you are unexperienced.
If you dont answer correctly you will not be able to rent and the money refund can take up to 30 days.
Especially if you are not a native speaker and would need to look up some words, the worker puts you under pressure by asking more and more questions, which is very bad services to me.</review>

< Review>
This is one of my favorite places to rent boats when visiting Newport Beach. Typically my wife and I like to rent a Duffy boat and take it in the Newport harbor with friends.

We recently rented from Boat Rentals of America again for probably the 10th time and we have only had positive experiences.

Whether you're going out for the first time or 100th time you'll feel comfortable with their training and nice employees.</Review>

We rented a Duffy to take a family relative from Italy on a "water perspective" tour of Newport Beach.  Boats were exceptionally clean.  Staff was organized and VERY helpful.  There are many places to rent boats on the harbor in Newport Beach.  However, I think the location, boats and service cannot be match at Balboa Boat Rentals.< /Review>

Had a not so great experience here. Was looking to rent a boat and the staff was not helpful. They said they were checking on the boat and while me and my party waited they continued to rent other boats out. Would def not come back or recommend.<//text>

Horrible.
After searching for a parking spot for about 25 mins (luckily we found one at all but had to pay a tremendous parking fee) we came to the front desk and were ask wether we have experience in driving a boat.
We answered that we rented several boats home in europe, so yes, we have experience.
After that she, the employee at the front desk, started to ask us some weird questions to make sure that we really do have the knowledge to drive a boat (which is understandable), but as we didn‘t understand some of her questions due to englisch vocabularies or the noises of the harbor she told us that she couldn’t allow us to rent that boat (we already paid for) and that we have to go home without her even trying to explain the rules of driving on of their boats to us , which are sometimes pretty different to those in europe.

So all in all it was an absolute disappointment and I can’t recommend that company for a boat rental at least not for foreigners.< /text>

Balboa Boat Rentals SCAMS people using AmazonLocal deals! After purchasing a 2-for-1 deal via AmazonLocal, Balboa Boat Rentals refused to let us use it, claiming they didn't have any openings. Their website required us to indicate whether we were redeeming an deal, and when we did, their calendar indicated that *every* day was fully booked until the day that the deal expired. If we indicated that we weren't redeeming a deal, the schedule was wide open. When we called to ask about that, they never returned our calls. We finally got through to them, and they told us that they would only let a certain number of deals be redeemed, so we were out of luck! Fortunately AmazonLocal gave us a refund, but I still can't believe Balboa Boat Rentals pulled that shady move! I can't imagine the other things they will do to avoid fulfilling their contracts/responsibilities with them. I sincerely hope no one gets injured doing their activities or has a bad experience with them, because I AM SURE they would avoid all responsibility/liability.< /Text>

Great spot for cocktails. I've been here a few times and have never been disappointed by my selection. It does rotate somewhat seasonally, which is always nice.

It's got a great vibe with impeccable decorations, blending in nicely with its setting of the lobby of an old financial building. I only take a star off because it's not a really a destination for more than one drink. It is SUPER popular for a post-work drink, where you will have a hard time finding a spot to sit and it's quite loud (though honestly this is true for most bars in the immediate area). I've also gone after dinner, and this is truly the best time to go if you want a more chill vibe. Unfortunately because of the location, last call is about 10 PM or so - once again really only able to enjoy one drink.

If you're looking for an early-night cap, this is your spot!< /review>

Luis is an awesome tender....
Very cold space and amazing cocktails
First was a Griffo Distillery Scott Street Gin with ouzo, lime, honey..... super delicious.
And the second an icy/ slurry combination of two whiskey, bourbon and Griffo Cold Brew Coffee Liqueur....<//review>

<text>A lovely little bar on one of the slower blocks of Irving. The eponymous fire is in the wall opposite the bar, and gives off a gorgeous red glow, which is a stroke of design brilliance. My date and I sat at the bar by the window and spent a few hours people watching, and I think we were both glad our bartender had a heavy wrist. Tread lightly with a Fireside screwdriver, they pack a wallop.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Very cool atmosphere; I had some smoked beverage which involved them burning a piece of cedar with a butane torch and then placing the cup over it so that the smokiness added to the aroma of the beverage but didn't really interfere with the taste. It was very cool. The location is kindof odd though; I'm not sure if its in the lobby of an office building but that is definitely a vibe it gives off.</Review>

Not a five star because it's tiny so it only takes like 20ish people for it to feel super crowded.

It's cool though. They have dope drinks. Located right in the financial district. And very very close to BART.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

For some reason half the bar is reserved every time I come here, and I don't visit often. Great drinks and friendly staff, but be prepared to look like a fool while you stand sipping your cocktail as everyone else is given special treatment and seated in VIP sections at opposite ends of the bar. With several other good drinking spots nearby I recommend skipping this place unless a seat is readily available.</text>

We ordered lentil sambussa, vegetarian combo and firfir vegetarian banatu. Every single item we ordered was cooked to perfection with balanced spice level. The chef even customized our order, made our banatu extra juicy and kicked up the spice level a notch.

Sambussa was crispy and the dipping sauce that came with it was yummy.

It is a small sit down/take out restaurant, they don't take reservations. So call ahead and make sure there is no wait to get seated.< /Review><time>1551628810656< /time>< Rating>

The place is cosy and the waiters are welcoming. The cocktails are really good and the little snacks too. The bartender even smoke the glasses on a grill with real fire. I recommend it.</Text>

Located in the  Financial District just a couple blocks north of Market St in the main lobby. As expected the streets were empty and so was The Treasury which was a good thing as it  provided  the opportunity to engage with the already friendly staff and among  ourselves without the loud and mostly vapid  chatter the seems to be the new norm. Drinks arrived proptly and we'll crafted. We didn't sample the bar bites but should I have the need to be in that area - it will be considered  a viable option< /Review>< pictures>

Too fancy/expensive for me. They do have a fun drink where they torch part of a barrel used for aging whisky to give your old fashioned an extra smoky flavour/aroma.</review>

Great spot; awful pour.  My Dark and Stormy had just a splash of dark (rum).  Everyone at my table had the same experience.   Our group was up for several rounds of drinks but not willing to be ripped off.  Left after the first round.  Barkeep needs a lesson or two.< /Review>

The guy at the door was the nicest! Once inside the music was rather loud. Not a large location but a decent amount of seats. The bartenders all seemed kind of moody. They weren't pushy or rude with their words but they had negative body language. I felt like I was ruing theit day with my otesence. Maybe I was, I'm sorry. I say they they because there were three bartenders and they were all off.

Drinkd are expensive and quantity is not at all worth the price. My friend and I ordered slushies with given seasonal flavors. She had watermelon, I had "aprium," a blend of apricot and plum. The aprium slushy uses rum which i think the bartender said is why that slushy had/had a bitter taste. The watermelon one is vodka and wverything you want in a waternelon slushy! Both slushies were very cold conpared to slushies wr drinj in other bars.

All in all, we didn't hate it there but we don't plan to ever go back. There just wasn't that "it" factor for us.<//Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The Tresuary is a good long drink place, located at the beginning of the San Francisco financial zone. Elegant, well set, reminiscent of a Treasury or Federal Reserve office. Good atmosphere, pleasant and recommended both before and after dinner, just take into account the SFCO schedules. The strong point is the cocktails, excellent presentation and well balanced in their alcohol. Good wine and beer menu. Adequate quality / price ratio. Recommended if you are in the area.

The Tresuary es un buen lugar de trago largo, ubicado al inicio de la zona financiera de San Francisco. Elegante, bien ambientado, recuerda a una oficina del Tesoro o de la Reserva Federal. Buen ambiente, agradable y recomendado tanto para antes como para después de la cena, tan sólo tener en cuenta los horarios de SFCO. El punto fuerte son los cocktails, excelente presentación y bien balanceados en su alcohol. Buena carta de vinos y cervezas. Adecuada relación calidad /precio. Recomendado si te encuentras por la zona.< /Text>< Date>

<date>1601437856005</date><rating>4< /rating><review>But I have gone into this place with family as a side kick to the many haunts we visit.

I may not be a customer personally but my family members have been and as I come with them, I see the facilities and can make judgements on the subject.

This is such a place.

If I felt a need to have my hair cut or trimmed or even colored, this would be a sure bet.
Simply because they are so nice here.

And they are well educated and their services are a cost effective experience.

A well lit, clean, and hospitable environment greets you and the same courtesy is shown at the end.

They use similar products that other places offer bit the cost is way lower.

< Review>
My daughter was sick 2 weeks ago and has a minor residual cough. We walked a mile on a warm day to get there, which brought out her cough. One little cough and they refused to cut her hair and kicked us out. Didn't matter that she's not contagious (we've been to the doctor) and wasn't hacking. I'll never step into this store again!<//Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I’ve gone here many times and usually I get out with a sub par but ok haircut. Today a lady told me I needed to use palm aid which I told her I don’t. She told me she was a hairdresser not a miracle worker and literally refused to cut my hair the way I wanted in the back saying I needed palm aid and trying to sell me some. When I told her I needed it cut shorter for work and she found out I was a firefighter her first question was, “have you seen any dead bodies.” Then proceeded to tell me her son’s I found a dead body story. People that actually see that  kind of stuff really don’t need to talk about it in a joking 5 minute conversation with someone who doesn’t care. Now I’m home cutting my own hair to fix her garbage work. Never again</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>If you go here,  don't let Tonya cut your hair. Tonya didn't listen to our instructions and gave both my friend and I bad haircuts on two separate occasions. If you're looking for a haircut, go somewhere else, there are other better places within the shopping center.<//text>< Pics>

Been coming here for a long time and have always had a good experience.
This place is super busy and the staff do the best they can. I've observed that most walk-in customers are impatient and can't be bothered with the wait list. Calling ahead allows you to plan ahead and skip most of the wait.</Text>

Bad services, the hours on the website was wrong That is my second time trying to get a hair cut with them and they wouldn't accept appointment even that was over one hour left before they close . The first time I walked in at 6:58 and was only one person having a hair cut and they said that was closing already . If they want to close by 7 they shouldn't have in the website that closes by 8 pm.
Definitely not going there again  and you guys shouldn't idem .< /review>

Made appointment. Went at time  There was a huge line. Asked how long it would be. Front guy just pointed to sit down in frustrated gesture. Asked again, he said I would be next. Asked again, he said he didn't know. Totally get they are busy, just wish they honored their appointments.</Text>

Poor customer service is what most of the reviews state and I concur, I have been to many Super Cuts that are busy and they do not use that fact as an excuse to provide poor service.  I refuse to be treated poorly so I walked out and took my business dollars elsewhere.<//text>

They are supposed to be open until 7pm but actually they are closed hours before that. I called before coming in and the receptionist didn't bother to mention their amended hours! I knocked on the door to see if it was a misunderstanding and to ask why they didn't bother mention it and the receptionist said I never called. Terrible customer service and the receptionist is ridiculously rude! We will never return.<//Review>

They "close" at 8pm but the truth is they clean for 30 minutes and won't accept anyone after 7:30. Why would you advertise 8pm closing then?< /Review>

A pipe burst in our wall, and Flood Busters was there within the hour with dry out equipment. We worked with Jonathan, and he was friendly, responsive, and very helpful with managing the project, helping us submit the insurance claim, and following up with contractors to help expedite the repair process. Every single company they recommended was wonderful to work with. Couldn’t recommend them enough.< /review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>James was amazing!

There was a leak that was causing some major unexpected water and mold issues in the garage, laundry, and entryway to our home.

James took us step by step as to what was going to happen. From calling insurance, to getting rid of all the water damaged areas, removing mold, drying all areas affected, and to following up daily, he was the most honest help we’ve gotten in a long time.

Call James from Flood Busters if you have any leak issues within your home!!

Thank you again!!<//Review>< pictures>

Flood Busters was recommended by my plumber. They were great! They came right away  and we’re very professional. Roman took over and explained the mitigation process and got things going. They took me step by step and were always there at the house on time. I trusted them and would recommend them to anyone.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>For the first time ever, I had a water leak, coming from upstairs down into my kitchen. My plumber called Flood Busters and Jonathan was there in less than half an hour. For the next several days, he took care of cleansing and dehumidifying the air and even more importantly, explained the entire process and sequencing of the services I would  need. As this was my first time experiencing this type of problem, his explanation and reassurance were invaluable.
In addition,  he  rearranged my kitchen so I could have access to the appliances I would need to stay in the house, and came by on a regular basis to make sure the process was moving along. He was available by phone and/or text seven days a week and I could not be more appreciative of his help and support in what was a very overwhelming situation!  I hope to never have another leak, but if I do, my first call will be to Jonathan and Flood Busters!!</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1619470552939, 'text': "First, thank you kindly for your review!

When my living room ceiling started leaking late  Thursday night, Ryan came out promptly, set up the machinery quickly and followed up until everything was dry enough to repair. I have used Flood Busters a couple of times and I am impressed with their professionalism. I heartily recommend them.<//review>

I had Jon as my technician and he was so great that I also gave him and flood busters a 5 star review on Yelp. They were always on time, very helpful and went above and beyond with being helpful and informative with what was happening while fixing my kitchen after a flood. The plumber, abatement crew and contractors that Jon recommended have all been very helpful.<//text>

Jesse and Ryan was extremely patient with me because of the pandemic I had all my kids at home. With everything going on I was overwhelmed needless to say, Jesse and Ryan assistant me as if they were family. These two gentleman walked me through the process until I understood completely everything that was going to transpire. Answering every questions my husband or myself had.
I am really grateful that Jesse and Ryan were the two  technicians  assigned to my flood.</review>

Great service and job well done! Flood Busters was referred to us by a trusted plumber and they were here in no time to dry out the water damage. Stephen assessed the damage, explained the process of drying out the water, and got the equipment setup. They cut out the necessary areas to be dried and once it was set up, they checked the moisture level daily until the moisture was back to normal (took a few days). Very professional and they were knowledgeable of their craft. Hopefully we won’t need flood service in the future, but if we do, we know who to call. We will most definitely refer them to friends and family!< /Text>

Jonathan Ruth from flood busters was called at 2:30 in the morning and was out here in a flash he and Stephen LaSogga worked to extract the water damage that we had,  set up drying machines and dehumidifiers and pulled up wet carpeting to prevent any extra damage.   Any other employees from flood busters that came into our home we’re all very professional and courteous   They all wore masks so everyone was safe during this pandemic   Especially kudos to Jonathan!< /Text>

<Review>Jonathan was so efficient and professional in letting me know what had to be done to remedy problems caused by a plumbing leak in my downstairs bedroom and bathroom. He was considerate in scheduling and coordinated well with the plumbers who were continuing to work while he was here.  He installed equipment to dry out my walls, carpet, and flooring and disinfected them.  And then he removed the  damaged drywall, carpeting, and flooring so that it was ready for another contractor to put it back together again.  He adhered to the COVID recommendations (social distancing, hand sanitizing, and masks) and made me feel safe.  He basically made a bad situation feel a bit better.< /Review><UserId.>117635902635286142921<//UserId.><gmapID>0x80d95803456b4991:0xcc39b81a03f177a4< /gmapID>< user_name>

We're so lucky to have them.  Very nice & knowledgeable professionals whose only goal was to help.  Shout out to the ff:
•  Steven [Boss]
He's always there to help. I will call him if
I have questions/concerns & or walk us through
what the work entails. We greatly appreciate you
& your time. Thanks a lot.

• Jonathan [Tech.]
We have an Emergency late Friday afternoon.
Jonathan came & upon seeing the areas, he wasted
no time in opening wet walls & brought in heavy
equipments to dry flooded areas. He will also drop
by the next day or two (this time with Jesse, a
trainee) to check if the affected areas were dry or
add more equipments if needed.
In our case, he added another Dehumifier with
Hepa filter (3 total) which will also help with my
Asthma.

These people are so reliable & very highly
recommended. They're there to help.
We will have them & their services in a heart beat.
Very satisfied customer.</Review>

From the initial call to Sarah & through the whole process working with James, it was a very good experience. James was nice enough to change his schedule so he could get to us quicker & begin to work on the broken pipe in the wall that flooded down the wall to the 1st level. He was very professional in all his work, cared about our home & us and made a unfortunate problem much easier to deal with. He was very attentive to our needs & went over & above even explained the details of the flood with the insurance company. And did the virtual walk through with the adjuster. James was very efficient in all he did as well. He was always on time & we felt he genuinely cared about our needs.

Also, Stephen, the manager, was amazing & understanding when I spoke with him regarding the process involved with the insurance payment. We would VERY MUCH recommend Flood Buster to anyone in need of the services they provide  & would definitely use them again.

<Text>What a reassuring team of professionals!  Jonathan was prompt, professional, knowledgeable, efficient, conscientious and communicative.  In times of crisis or any time, you can rest assured your problems will be swiftly and effectively ameliorated.   Not only has Flood Busters earned my highest recommendation as a homeowner and landlord, when I was searching for the right company to deal with substantial water damage, the plumbers and builders with whom I was working all gave the company their sound endorsement as well.  Flood Busters is the choice of homeowners, plumbers and rental property owners.  Thank you, Jonathan for being a calm in the storm of my cottage crisis!</Text>< Response>

< Review>
I had a major leak inside the walls of my house in Cardiff by the Sea during this whole Covid 19 pandemic. I was confused and honestly scared about what my next move should be.
Called a trusted plumber who introduced me to Morgan of Flood Busters. He arrived on the scene that very day. Explained the next needed steps and gave me a reasonable quote just in case homeowners insurance did not cover the repairs. He quickly became the point man for the entire repair. He was sincere, open and honest. Communicated with the adjuster and referred an equally competent drywall outfit to finish the job.
I highly appreciate and recommend this business

i was totally bummed that we had a leak but the plumber recommended Flood Busters. Jonathon came to our rescue. He was awesome. They removed the damaged dry wall, the shower and left fans to dry the walls. Im so pleased that this was only a couple day process. Thank you Jonathan I will be singing your praises to everyone at work!</text>

<user>105071359709688290828< /user><date>1560539775388< /date><review>We had a CAT 3 flood and unfortunately we did not use Flood Busters which was a horrible decision on our part. The company United drying screwed us hard on cost of work they did not perform. After the Asbestos company removed all the affect debris from our house, we were referred to Steve at Flood Busters. Steve was very professional and could have set up multiple blowers, air scrubbers, dehumidifiers and done our  microbial wash. He was very honest and said we didn’t need all that and our home was dry.

It’s very hard to find an honest company and a guy that is very polite. We had him do the wash anyways for piece of mind. I wish we would have called him first. Steve is very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. We could of been back in our house sooner than we are now.

I highly recommend calling Steve at Flood Busters if you are in any kind of flood disaster!

Thank You Steve!<//review></record>

Absolutely excellent service. Our home has some serious water damage and Flood Busters walked me through what was going on with the house and the plan of attack I couldn’t be more grateful during a time when our home had some water damage. Extremely reliable and always communicated what was going on and the plan for each day.  I couldn’t be more happy with the service and care they provided through a very trying time for our family.  Thank you all so much!< /text>

Had a bathroom leak on the second floor toilet area. After the leak was secured, Flood Busters came in and did a total evaluation.  They tried to do the least intrusive method first to alleviate my troubles. Once they found it not working, they addressed their concerns with me and we elevated the efforts and were able to complete the cleanup fast. Great service and Communication was top notch. I would gladly recommend them to friends and family.</Review>

Recently had some minor water damage from a small leak in the ceiling. So I contacted flood busters on behalf of my landlord who was out of the country. Danny comes over to find the leak for a plumber who was on his way. So Danny finds the leak after cutting a few holes about a 1’x1’ big which was fine cause more of the drywall had to come down anyway. So the leak gets fixed fans were set up and everything was good. A day later I had my girlfriend stay home to be here for the demo, I thought everything was good. The affected are was a 15’x8’ double 1/2” drywall that was saturated. It took them almost 7 hours to complete the rest of the demo that Danny hadn’t already done! They totally took advantage of the situation and milked the hell out of it! I called Danny to give him my thoughts and he try’s talking to me like I don’t know how long it should take and it’s a lot of work, I’ve been in construction/ deconstruction since I’m 17 now 34 so I know what I’m talking about stay away from this
company or at least have an eye on them!

Edit 5/22
I spoke with the owner after he read my review, he explained to me that because it’s an insurance claim they can’t bill by hour it’s by the square footage I wrote my review based off the information on the invoice I received that had all the hourly information so I guess I jumped to conclusions. To my earlier review about them milking it I still think it took quite a bit longer than it should have but they were not trying to run the bill up as it was explained to me. At the end of the day they did a good job and were professional</text>

Flood Busters was a great help to us when we were overwhelmed when our home experienced water damage. The technician, Morgan, did a great job responding quickly, and helping us navigate all the decisions along the way.< /Review>

Morgan from Flood Busters was very courteous and explained every step of the process. He even explained how the dehumidifier and fans work to help dry any moisture in our bathroom. He helped me call my insurance company to start my claim. He followed up by asking when our plumber was coming for repairs so he could pick up the machines at the same time as the plumber so I wouldn't be waiting around at a different time for people to come to my house. The demo team who came in the middle of the week during the dry out, was also courteous and friendly. I really appreciate everyone's help during the "Flood Busting" process. I hope I dont have any more water problems, but if I do, I will definitely be calling them again.<//Text>

<Review>We woke up to find our downstairs all wet from a broken pipe under our kitchen sink. We called Flood Busters and they came out immediately and started cleaning up the water. They also helped us file the claim with our insurance and met the adjuster to explain all the work that was being done. Flood Busters was very helpful in a very stressful situation. We are very thankful that they were there to help us and would definitely recommend them to someone that is dealing with this type of problem. I would give them 10 stars if I could. Thank You Flood Busters!</Review>< Pictures>

I had gas leak inside my stove. After bad experience with another company i called Appliance repair master. They were pretty quick at identifying the problem. It was small tiny leak. Tech fixed it and put new fittings. Great Job!< /text>

Great professional job to repair my GE refrigerator that stopped working. Technician 'Greg' came to fix within the same day. A friendly personality, who took time and care.</Text>

< Review>
My LG fridge died on me and was skeptical of having it fixed and was contemplating of buying a used one.  My wife suggested to have it serviced first since buying was not in our budget.  Greg,  of APPLIANCE REPAIR MASTER,  came promptly the next day and started assessing the problem.  He us kind and courteous and showed where the problem started.  I am giving these shop a five star since not only did he fixed and replaced the needed part but also gave us pointers on how to care for my old 2002 LG refrigerator</Review>

<Review>Greg is very experienced and handy, he knew the problem immediately and fixed it without any hiccups, he actually showed me how to fix it, and also let me took some pictures and videos so I could fix the dryer next time if same problem happened again. Overall very good services.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUqtFUro5_H5AIrUen_l7yqsCagTiITC29BPUN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<review>Our 7 year old Wall heater was repaired by Max of Appliance Repair Master San Jose. He was prompt and arrived as promised, early on Monday morning. Quickly diagnosed the problem which was in the control board. The part was ordered and replaced when it came in few days later. Max as a person was prompt, knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with. The cost for parts and labor seemed reasonable, chipper than new one. Thank you Max<//review>< user>

<Text>They were able to come out to fix my refrigerator within 24 hours! Greg helped fix mine. It took about and hour and he was very informative about the issue with my fridge and what may have caused it and how I could prevent it in the future! He did everything efficiently and he cleaned up after himself! Thankyou for your help!</Text>< pics>

This is our first time to have ARM repair our fridge and we are so happy. Their booking agents were polite and courteous, they tried to find the fastest appointment for us as our fridge stopped working. When the technician came he did a thorough checked and found the problems right away and placed order for parts. We are very please with the technician, not only professional but he was also very courteous and polite. He took his time to explained thing for us. Thank you  and especially Max for a great experience.</review>

Curtious, knowledgeable and efficient with the repair. Walked me through each step of the repair which made it easy to understand what went wrong and what was fixed.</Text>

<Text>Very low service fee, I would recommend this company especially their technician Bill. He was very helpful with explaining the problem with my refrigerator. Bill came to me the same day, did his work perfectly, and gave a discount for future call. I'm happy with this service< /Text>< username>

Our front loading washing machine was not spinning, that's why we had to call for repair help. The technician from Appliance repair San Jose was on time and he was able to resolve the problem really quick. Thanks a lot! We were able to do the laundry on the same day.

Good  service in Bay Area, no doubt. Russell stayed as long as needed to fix my built in fridge. The guy came just in an hour after Made a call. It didn't take him a long time to finish the repair, while demonstrating very friendly attitude. The also provided a warranty and called me once after repair to make sure that I didn't  face any troubles with my fridge again.</Text>

I found this place while searching on local area and called, and these guys were able to come on the same day! Job was done within an hour and the price was even cheaper than what I expected. (the best part!) The mechanic was very nice and explained thoroughly of what is wrong and what needs to be done.

Joe called in 15 minutes before arrival to service my refrigerator. It took less then 2 minutes to identify the issue with it. Turns out the heating element was not defrosting the ice on the evaporator coil. Joe also got  a spare part in his van. He did a very neat job and even cleaned the freezer after his job was done. I'm very impressed  with their service. No need to mention an affordable price for that repair . Thank you Joe!< /Review>

I even gave the technician extra time in case the technician was stuck in the traffic. However, the technician still no show. I  have to cancel the appointment and call another company. It wasted my time. I give one star because google review doesn't take zero star.< /review><user>107779852677981481068< /user><response>None</response><rating>1< /rating>< pics>

<Review>The tech Greg came within the allocated time limit of 2 hours. The appointment was scheduled a day before. This was the fastest service repair I have seen.

Technician took time to diagnose and explained me every question I had. The price quoted for the entire part was decent enough. The Technician also added a 6-month warranty for the repair he did. Will definitely recommend him for any issues for Refrigerator.<//Review>< Time>

<Review>I called in this company in the morning and same day, technician Russell, came to me. I was able to get the fridge to exhibit the strange behavior and Russell swapped out the motherboard which he had with him! Fridge is working great and it even fixed the broken ice dispenser too! Thanks for the prompt and courteous service!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>My close family always gets in touch with Appliance Repair Master for all of our appliance repairs. We know Tom, Bill and Max. They service all major makes and models of refrigerators, stoves, laundry appliances and much more. Their techs waste no time responding and get right to work on the task at hand. I can’t thank them enough for the outstanding service they have provided over the years.<//Text>< Pics>

I had an appointment on Friday got gel polish, I was happy it looked beautiful! Then, I go home wash a few dishes took a bath only to notice when I got out of bath the polish was peeled/ chipped off of 4 fingers! I went early Saturday morning had them fixed - so if course I was thankful! ( I got them done for a special occasion, Saturday night)
Saturday evening I’m getting ready for my even and sure enough another nail starts to peel off, I was able to put clear polish to old it down- it worked! Sunday, however that same finger ( nail) plus now 2 more nails peeled off!! This was so disappointing! I tried to call Monday no answer- unfortunately I was too busy to go in and get this taken care of AGAIN! I was able to remove the GEL Polish easily!
The product they used had to be bad, I mean how does this happen! I spent ( wasted ) money with them! I will never go there again and do not recommend them!<//text>

Had a horrible experience. I heard their work was good so I made two appointments for my mom and I and was excited for it. Checked in on time and was waiting for our turn. 10 minutes later another girl walks in with a later appointment time and gets helped right away. 15 minutes later my mom gets helped but 45 minutes later I was still not helped. Once my mom was done, I gave up and just left. When I mentioned this to the hostess her response was "there's people that have waited for longer." I completely understand that they can get busy but that just doesn't seem like the right response. Can't speak on their work because I was not able to experience it.< /text>

Got my nails done for the first time and it was an okay experience. Was a bit ruff on my nails and didn't get what actually wanted. Sanitation wasn't the best either 😕.< /Text>

Bin did a really good job on my nails and he’s fast. He listens to what I ask him to do and he does it. My nail beds are sensitive these days, so he needs to be extra gentle when using the drill. He is careful, and makes sure I have a comfortable experience. Also, they use liners in the pedi bowls, which is important to me. Give them a try!< /text>

First time here , place looked great . Wait time was pretty quick . But once I got the the chair , she turned water on cleaned up my feet . But once she put my foot in the water it was really COLD! I asked her nicely if she can change the water to hot or at least warm but she completely IGNORED ME THOSE 3 times ., it was really uncomfortable too me ., I wouldn’t come here again honestly . Still tipped her . just thought it was about the customers here , guess not .< /Text>

Great customer service! Love the way Ben and Na do my nails. Even my own mother ( and she had her nail tech for more than 13yrs) she switched to SOHO nails. Mind you she is SUPPER PICKY TO THE MAX. And he loved it. So that sayas it all.  Really detail oriented and precise. You will save yourself time if you make an appointment. Overall would not go with no one else if it’s not SOHO nails.</Review>

Soho is the best salon in Kerman. It is very clean, and everyone is very friendly. Amy always takes her time and gives the best pedicures and manicures! She is always busy and you need to make an appointment for her on the website.<//text>

Sadly, I have to give a low rating for this salon. I went for a full set as a walk-in and was told the wait was 2hrs. So it's not really a great place for a walk-in - make an appointment. (Especially if you have a 20 min drive to get there.) Even after we came back for our appt 2 hrs later, we ended up waiting another 30-40 min to get to a station. Once I sat down, my dude came up to the station an then left for about 10 minutes. He was super friendly and when I told him I wanted acrylics, he pushed the dip method on me pretty hard. I said OK and went with it. One of the colors I picked they didn't have. My nail shape (almond) and length ended up perfect, but the roundness of my nails are funky - almost looking pregnant if you look at them horizontally. (That's the only way I can describe). You can't really tell unless you really analyze them. But overall they look OK. Two weeks and no lifting, but if I run my fingers through my hair, the hair catches on the back of the nails where they've grown away from the cuticles. I bet if I messed with them at that spot, they'd come off pretty easily.

The salon doesn't look very clean and they were pretty scattered. One of the girls there kept poking or tickling my nail dude and did it once when he had the metal electric file on my hands which freaked me out. Those hurt when they touch skin!!

Prices are OK - about average for nail salons in the valley. My friend that went with me was given to a tech that we were told was there on his first day and they didn't seem too confident in his work and told us the first client he had hated his work. He did a nice job though considering she wanted a black to hot pink ombre color.

I may go back for maybe just a pedicure - but they definitely need to clean the place up and get a better rhythm there for me to update my rating.</text>

Very nice experience going after a long day at work. All employees seem to have a great calm positive energy. Loved the atmosphere with music videos on one t.v and a movie with subtittles on the other t.v. definately will go back again. Thank you Kathy for making my first visit a great experience.<//text>

The decor is dark yet warm with orange hues and fabulous artwork that complements the ambiance.  The simple bar offerings of beer, wine & champagne made it easy for me to cozy up to my cute date and my generous pour of shiraz.  Great place for convos or cuddling in the candlelight.  The staff was attentive and helpful, but I do have to agree that the early weeknight closing time kinda sucks.  Just as I was getting comfy in my booth, which had a great view of bustling Divis and the pouring rain, the bartender came over to warn us it was last call at 10:30!  But it was way worth the trip and there are plenty of late-night alternatives nearby.  Bar 821 is a pleasurable little secret... but it didn't come from me : )</review>< GmapID>

Pros: Definition of a dive a dive bar. Good ambience. Decent crowd following a Sharks game.
Cons: Older female bartender looked my friend in the face and skipped her 3x and then questioned her and another patron on who was there first. Procedeed to serve other patron before friend even though she had acknowledged that my friend had been their first.
Totally fine, see your busy, it's cool. But upon ordering Irish Car Bombs she refused to let us pour our own shots and let the drink curdle as she served it to us.
I am not one to bag on a place normally, but this service left a sour taste in my mouth on an otherwise awesome bar.<//Text>

<Review>Went in to enjoy a drink where I knew I would find some fellow fans in a place I've enjoyed before. The woman bartender was so drunk that she decided to berate me for asking what kind of scotch she had available. So I asked for a Jameson, and the beratement continued. I wasn't served, and I left. It's what you would expect a little dive bar to be, but you better get there early while the Prima Donna is still serving. If you like being treated with respect, I recommend that you take your post-game business elsewhere.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcca770e6c041:0xc46f277637fc5992<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>First and last time at this bar. I was just starting to drink my second margarita wich Margie just finished servings me and what appeared to be the end of her shirt when Laura approach me and started interigating me about the previous transaction with Margie. I felt as she was very unprofessional and rude and had a bad chip on her shoulder. I will never ever go back agaiñ. what ever problem Laura and Margie had between them should not affect customers no matter what! Laura needs to learn customer service!!!! Margie  thank you for your kindness and customer service ❤️ thanks..  even Tony the maintenance guy agreed with me outside the bar and suggested I go on Yelp. Laura you have deep problems!!! Find another carrier and stop chasing away customers!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>On Sundays they have very authentic pozole. The best of the best. Besides the pozole, the rest seems to be a very standard bar with good beer selection and nice environment. The interior is very dim, if this does not suit you there is outdoors seating area where there is more light. It is sad this place will close soon. Go visit before they close.< /Review>< Pics>

Patty’s is a great place to drink a few before a Sharks game. There’s also food which can be important if you’re puttin’ em down. Based on other reviews I’m guessing my bartender was Laura. She was not very happy to serve us and exhibited significant disgruntlement after we ordered a drink with more than two ingredients. It seems she can be a problem bartender but perhaps that’s what adds character to this bar. In my humble opinion, I would recommend she take a more back-end role.< /Text>

Laura had the personality of a grapefruit. She really shouldn’t be dealing with the public. She was incredibly rude to my friends and I. If you are going to be a bartender then you need to be able to adapt and effecting communicate and she obviously was incapable of doing so.< /Review>

I was in town for a conference and found this hidden gem. My group was immediately welcomed in by Flora and the other patrons. Drinks were fantastic, they even helped us order a pizza at midnight! There was a pool table, and the bathroom was spectacularly clean. If I'm in town again, I'm definitely coming back!!<//Review>

Usually it is quiet and uncrowded but on match days Sharks or concerts in the SAP many people arrive.

I went to San Jose twice and both mandatorily had to go through there.

This place started out as being so chill. Come 5 hours and a few drinks in and it gets shakey. I'm not one to make a fuss or put up a fight but I went to the bathroom and then was forced out ....hmm I paid for all my drinks. And a few others at that. Never gave the bartenders any kind of attitude or hassle and yet I was told I NEEDED to leave because I was being "a pain" what eves. Came in only because I was walking and it started raining. At the time the bartenders was cool af but then after the game started and more people started showing up or became a problem</text>

My car broke down and i wasn't going to  be able to get the part till the morning. It was 1:30am and i was starved. I walked up and i was kindly informed that they were closed. The gentleman at the door looked at me then told me to wait. He came back out with a sandwich and a bag of potato chips. I tryed to pay him and he refused. Told me to get home safe with a smile. It was an awesome experience. Thank you kind people. Johnny hostetter.  Santa cruz ca</text>

There is a patio you can drink and/or smoke on. There are plenty of regulars that go there, but not clickish, all very nice and friendly people. Very good after work scene and also a great place to go for drinks before a sharks game. Free wifi if you want to post up and do some work while you drink (which I've actually seen many do). The bar tenders are great, Kevin is hilarious, Eddie treats the bar as if it is his own and makes sure the place is running smooth, during the day is Charlene who is a total sweet heart, and on the weekends you'll find the owner, Kenny working. Every Sunday morning Kenny's wife is in making Pozole you can buy a bowl of for something like $5. Also every Friday afternoon they put out the big sandwich (a 6 foot sub) which is complimentary. One last thing - they sell beer to go! So if you're about to hop on Caltrain you can drop in and grab a few cold ones for your ride. So drop on in and say hi!<//Text><user_id>107924188626794422696< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

The pictures online are deceiving as this is a bar and the sign says no one over 21 allowed in. A very nice man sold me a sandwich that was very tasty and economical as compared to the high prices at the SAP center.< /Text>

(Original)

< Review>
My first time to be here but I will surely be coming back in the future.  They are very well organized from the time you schedule an appointment up to the time you come back for your prescription glasses.  The optometrist took lengthy time in discussing my concerns and with the eye examination itself. They don’t let you wait for long like some other offices. They give you options on how and what you want and most of all on what you can afford. If you have concerns, they respond to their phone system via text very quickly. Validated parking  is very convenient as well knowing it is in the K-town area. Overall, I would highly recommend!<//Review>

Online booking was super easy. Very friendly staff! They were patient and very helpful in explaining the process and the doctor was wonderful. Answered all my questions and really cared about eye health. They also validate parking when you park in the garage! I recommend.</Review>

<date>1622161063860< /date><rate>5<//rate><Text>This is my first time trying contacts and I was very impressed with their patience and explanations. Also I’ve been wearing glasses since I was 8 and no one has ever explained things to me to the extent they have. On this visit I got free trial contacts and I was able to order glasses. I don’t have the glasses yet as I just ordered them but I am sure they will be great.

I am from east coast and this is honestly the best customer service I’ve experienced on the west coast so far. They answered all of my questions and everyone was very nice and patient and I will go back there for all of my optometry needs.

I’m not sure my doctors name but it was a woman and she was amazing! I definitely recommend everyone to give them a try.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>If you are on a budget, this may not be the place for you as sometimes it is a little bit expensive. Otherwise, they have a really fine collection of brands of a lot. Examples include Oakley, Ray Ban, and Chanel. The exam is simple and easy. Optometrists are really nice. Took one week for my prescription glasses to be ready which is not bad. Limited Space for parking outside so its better to use the garage which is located on Serrano Avenue.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Made an appt to get an eye exam for my prescription lenses.  As soon as I enter I am almost immediately seen by Christine Chen who performed the exam and she was so super sweet and friendly.  She answered all the questions I had and even informed me of information I did not know regarding the health of my eyes.  The gentleman who handled my payment was also super friendly.  The place is sooo nice and looks very clean, highly recommend this place for eye exams</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The facilities were super clean and felt very covid safe, the optometrist was so lovely and easy to talk to, and the man who helped show me frames was so patient and accommodating while I struggled to make a frame decision -it’s tough to do with a mask on! They carry a wide selection of frame choices in all price brackets. I was pleasantly surprised. Will be returning!<//Review>

Excellent service from everyone I interacted with. Easy to onboard as a new patient. Their facility is clean, state of the art. Dr was knowledgeable, pragmatic, and friendly. Fair and simple to pay for services. Will be SEEING Optikos again. Parking is free in Aroma garage w/ validation. Hey, drive to the top of the garage afterwards and you can hit some golf balls at the driving range.</review>

This business is the best!!! The owner, Kathy, is so much fun and so helpful. Everyone really cares that you find the right fit and leave happy. We needed glasses last minute for my best friend as we were leaving for London and he wanted to be able to see, and they totally got it done in a total of about a half an hour. Definitely recommend!< /Text>

<Text>Let me start by saying that this place fantastic. My schedule for the day was quite hectic, and finding time to come in was difficult. I called ahead and asked if they can take walk ins and they welcomed me without hesitation.

The optometrist here is gorgeous, professional, and very polite. She was very helpful and efficient. The exam itself was quick and painless; I was in and out within 15 minutes. The staff was also very professional and helpful.

Absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. I would highly recommend anyone looking for an eye exam.

Prices are also great!!</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Since I was just going in for contacts I didn't peek at the frames but there's a pretty nice assortment that I might take a peak at in the future. Also they validate parking for you!<//Review>< Response>

Wonderful top notch customer service and medical care. I was a walk in, was greeted immediately and completing paperwork within 5 minutes. Doctor saw me maybe 7-10m later and was terrific. Top notch experience in koreatown. Pricing also terrific comparatively. Great deal. Great service, great eye-care and great pricing ... come on that’s hard to beat!!</review>

Great customer service.  The entire staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  I went for an eye exam and to order glasses and contacts. They reviewed my plan and ran thru my options to make sure I got the most that I could.  They even provided me with a few frame options while I was searching for glasses. And I ended up buying one of the styles they suggested that I would have never tried but ended up loving.  They have a good selection of frames and allow you the time and space to try them on without making you feel like there's any pressure while still being attentive.  I highly recommend trying Optikos.< /Text>

<review>I found this place online, after searching in the Valley & Hollywood, and calling around to Target, Costco, the malls, I ended you driving to Korea town and I am very happy to report that the service was excellent, the place was very clean and the staff very professional, and most importantly, the process very reasonable. They are not trying to rip you off here. However, if you are looking for high end items, they also carry that here.< /review>< UserId.>

The doctors/medical side of this place are fabulous.  Extremely professional and fast, seemed highly competent.  So I'm torn because I loved that side of the business and would want to return again.  However, I did not enjoy the frames sales experience at all and would give that side lower than 4 stars.  After giving the salesperson a few very simple criteria, including no bright/neon frames, he proceeded to ignore what I wanted and just keep piling frames in front of me and insisting I try them on, including bright ones that were the exact opposite of what I'd said I was looking for.  Multiple times, I'd literally get up from the chair to go look at something I was interested in, and he'd call me back as soon as my butt left the seat.  I went to several stores yesterday looking for frames and no one else treated me like that.  It felt rude and pushy.  If he'd just let me relax and look around the store on my own, I might have found something I liked.< /text>

<Review>Really a great experience. As a UCLA grad student, I was looking for an alternative after learning that our campus vision center was going to charge me an absurd amount of separate fees for eye exam, contact lens fitting, AND purchasing lenses on top of that, despite UCLA also being the source of my insurance. I tried Optikos based on reviews and being in the neighborhood, and they offered a great deal on both the exam PLUS six months' worth of contacts with my updated prescriptions - about a third of what UCLA would have charged for exam alone. The atmosphere at Optikos was also welcoming and helpful, and the doctor excellent at explaining potential issues (I'm pregnant, which can affect my vision) and my options for corrective lenses. Since my lens prescription is provisional until after the baby's arrived, I opted for a short supply of contacts and to come back later for an updated prescription and glasses. In other words, I'll definitely be back!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b88491d3f5a3:0x4f8d4c74470086a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I've been a customer/patient here for about 15 years; good service and optometrists overall.  Great selection of frames and they seem to have the latest in soft contact lenses.  Recently I ordered a pair of reading glasses.  After 3 weeks (I usually receive glasses/contacts in 1 week after ordering), I received a voicemail that the glasses arrived with an incorrect prescription.  I'm now waiting for them to redo the order and provide this prescription; total wait time will be about 1 month.  These mistakes happen, but this recent delay has definitely been an inconvenience. Overall, I mildly recommend this shop, but administrative gaps (leading to delays in receipt of eye-wear) have increased recently since they have grown.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

What a great team!  I enjoyed my service from the first phone call, to the reception, doctor visit and consult for glasses.  They were patient with my questions and felt I was in good hands. This is a great place to go, especially if you are tired of the long waits at the bigger optical places as I had been going to for year.  I was in and out in about 30 minutes.<//Text>

I have been coming here for about 5-6 years! I remember I needed glasses asap but most optometrists couldn't book me until another month! I don't know how but I came across Optikos number and called and they accepted a walk in that same day! The man there who assisted me was very kind and they were all gentle with me. They also helped me choose within my means. I have been reccomending them to everyone! I have not been disappointed since!< /text>

I cannot fully express how much I appreciate Dr Christine Chen. I have a difficult contact lens script and have been to tons of other Optometrists and ophthalmologists and NONE have come anywhere close to providing the vision I now have with my new script from Dr Chen. Scheduling is a breeze, very professional shop on every level. I just cannot say enough about these guys.< /text>

I came here to write a complaint but after reflecting on the overall experience, I have to give five stars because Dr. Isabel Duong was very kind, competent, thorough and accomodating.

I am a bit torn apart because the staff were.. well, they are not the worst, but I can point out at least a couple things that could be improved. But aside from that, the clinic portion of the experience was so positive I can't give any less stars in clean conscience.<//text>

Dr. Julie Chang has the latest electronic tools, efficient staff, onsite parking validation, a Starbucks across the lobby. But, most of all, she is knowledgeable and informative about your eye health and what affects them. Her prescriptions are spot on, and Dr. Chang couldn't be more charming.< /Text>

I have been going to Optikos for several years now.  Bottom line,  I go back for the service and selection.  Sean is always greets me with a friendly smile and ready help.  I was in need of glasses yesterday,  Sean took care of me and within a couple hours I had my glasses and could see again.

Also, If I can’t find what I’m looking for (which is rare since they have the best selection of frames around) Sean has taken the the time find it or see if what I am looking for is still available.

The doctors take the time to listen to my concerns, doesn’t feel like you’re being rush in and out.

I won’t go anywhere else...<//Text>

The staff and optometrists at Optikos are incredible! You are immediately greeted by helpful staff and the wait time during a weekday was nonexistent. Both my family and myself continue to shop at optikos year after year!<//Text>

This place has the worst attitude ever, the guy did not try to help at all and in contrast have me very mean look and acting very impatient when I was just trying to understand what's going on with my eyes because I'm worried that I might have an eye disease. If you just want a glasses, go for it, but if you want to take care of your eyes, I'd say somewhere else is better for you.< /text>

<Review>The building is mostly employee access only, no isles to look for bolts or special door panel clips, so only 4 stars. Not crowded, counter help is fast and knowledgeable. If you're in a hurry, go here.<//Review>< date>

My experience with Dr Rose was amazing. She listened to all my concerns and gave me my so much needed peace of mind with all her good advice.. She spent a good amount of time with me unlike other doctors. I felt like I was talking to a long time friend..she is very knowledgeable,  professional and caring . She is an outstanding gynecologist,  I highly recommend her.< /review>

< Review>
I am beyond satisfied. I was looking for a new ob-gyn. As soon as I met ms Jennifer Li I felt I was in great hands. I have gone through many doctors and she is by far the most caring doctor I met. I never felt rushed, or felt as if I didn’t have a voice. I feel like I’m in very good hands at Dr. Rose office. Highly recommend!!!!</Review>

Dr Rose and her staff were absolutely amazing.  The lady at the front desk was so nice and helpful.  The nurse who helped me was also very nice and attentive.  And then Dr Rose was a very relaxed, kind doctor who made sure to listen to everything I had concerns about answered any questions.  I was also in and out very quick!<//review>

I have been looking for an OB for a while and I came across Dr. Rose and her office.  Having just had a miscarriage a couple weeks prior she made sure I had all the answers even before I asked the questions.  She is a doctor that reads history and goes through it before meeting you.   She is very thorough and her staff is very courteous and helpful. I had called their office from the ER about an antibiotic injection and medication even before I became a patient there and they were so helpful!</text>

My first visit to the office was great! The staff are all very friendly and helpful and really make you feel comfortable. Nurse Li was amazing and really listened to all my different concerns and put together a comprehensive treatment plan and course of action right off the bat. I have been to other offices where I felt my concerns were brushed off or made to seem irrational since I was still considered "young". She really made me feel reassured that she will be helping me along the way in the best way possible to figure out what needs to be done or taken care of when it comes to my health. Couldn't be happier with the experience!<//Text>

<review>After multiple visits to OBGYN Doctors in Pasadena,  New Port, Long Beach, and even Kern County, everyone at Rose Womens Health was beyond what I was expecting! They definitely exceeded expectations! The first issue that I had with many doctors, was trying to find someone that could do a procedure in their actual clinic and not have to transfer me to a specialist and even in some cases to a hospital to do additional procedures that were unnecessary. Dr. Rose’s staff explained their process very seamlessly and had me in a consultation immediately the next day. The results and the exam where so fast, where other places didn’t even have the results until I came back in the office or even took weeks to get any type of follow up. At Rose Women’s Health I had answers within a week and a procedure done with 2 weeks! I also had reminders of my upcoming appointments and was given clear instruction on what to do throughout the process. Additionally, I was beyond nervous and stressed out, not knowing what the outcome would be, but thank goodness that for once the staff was compassionate and very accommodating. When it came to the actual exams and procedures, Dr. Rose was so professional in the way she conducts the procedures explaining everything along the way. My husband and I are completely thankful to have found such an amazing Dr. with great staff! I absolutely love going to Rose Women’s Health and look forward to being able to welcome our first child in the near future!

P.S. don’t be discouraged about the negative reviews. It’s unfortunate how easy it is to misinterpret other people. Words or actions can be taken so many different ways. As my husband being a business owner for the last 5 years, anyone can put a negative review just because. They may not be a client and they may have acted so quickly on emotion and failed to listen or understand. Especially right now with our world being turned upside down, it seems that a lot of people are on edge. I went just recently for my annual exam and everyone was bright and cheery! That means that everyone there not only appreciates the opportunity to help anyone that walks through their doors, but also because everyone loves what they do!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The PA Jen is fantastic!  She allows me to discuss every concern or question on my list and is helpful with advice and follow up.  It’s so important for me to be taken seriously with family cancer history, fibroids, anemia, and family planning.  I appreciate the level of care.</Text>

Dr. Rose and her staff are in a class of their own!! My sister delivered her baby with Dr. Rose 13 years ago and loved Dr. Rose. I took her recommendation and Dr. Rose and her staff are attentive, compassionate, and always willing to help me with any questions I have. During COVID, Dr. Rose and her staff have protocols in place to keep everyone safe. I feel super comfortable know Dr. Rose and her staff are here for me!!</Text>

< Review>
Amazing doctor and amazing staff! I was a little nervous because it has been years since I've seen an OBGYN and because we're in the middle of a pandemic. I didn't quite know what to expect. As soon as arrived, my nerves were immediately at ease. The office has a wonderful, calming energy and the staff is super sweet and personable. Dr. Rose is so warm and really takes the time to listen, she made me feel extremely comfortable. My whole experience was very pleasant and I'm so happy to have found a wonderful doctor and practice.<//Review>

I absolutely love dr. Rose, Jennifer the nurse practitioner and her fantastic efficient staff. They are dynamic friendly and compassionate. They even make the painful procedures go by with ease. The appointments are on schedule and I’m in and out so fast.

Truly appreciate all of  the staff🙏

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>This is my second pregnancy and my first time here with Dr Rose and her staffs.
At the first couple months of my pregnancy, my insurance assigned me to a male doctor which I didn’t happy with. I upgraded my insurance to PPO which I can pick any doctor I wanted. I chose Methodist hospital or Huntington hospital for labour and delivery. Dr Rose works for both.
I would love to have a young doctor/ RN to care for my pregnancy and dr Rose in her mid forty which is great. I called the office and i knew this is the right place. The staffs are friendly, professional. The place is high-end, clean and not crowded. The time I spent there always lesser than 40’ .
Moreover, I’m planning to come back to Rose women’s healthcare even after giving birth.
They offer so many things to care for women’s health...</review>< pictures>

The staff was extremely accommodating at getting me in as quickly as possible. The entire staff is so professional, while at the same time being very genuine and friendly. They absolutely get 5 stars from me for putting the patient at ease in what can sometimes be a bit of an uncomfortable visit!

I was impressed with how clean and organized the office is. Beautifully decorated, as well as appearing to have the state of the art tools and equipment to offer. (Not sure who the 'photographer' in the place is- but the wall art is truly impressive!)

Dr. Rose herself was so comfortable to speak with, and didn't make me feel rushed with my visit. She has a wonderful 'bedside' manner. I do work in medical- so I know how important this is, and how difficult it can sometimes be to find!

So- all in all I give them 5 stars. Start to finish- my initial visit was exceptional & I look forward to becoming an established patient with the practice.

Thanks Dr. Rose and staff!   :)<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Ms. Li actively listened to all of my concerns and made sure to thoroughly answered all of my questions.  I feel confident knowing that my questions and concerns are being taken care of.  The nurse was also very kind and professional.  I'm glad that I selected this location for my feminine concerns.< /text>

My visit/appointment was wonderful.  I appreciated the fact that only one patient was allowed in the waiting room, the staff was friendly and made you feel comfortable.  My visit with Dr. Rose was amazing - like it always is - she took her time and did not rush through the appointment, answered my questions and she made time to talk with me after the exam.  I wish all my appointments were as good.  Thank you Dr. Rose!!< /Review>

<review>Dr. Rose is truly the best OBGYN out there! Dr. Rose delivered my first baby boy and now I'm seeing her again as I'm expecting my second child. She is truly the best doctor I've ever met with. Her and her staff is incredibly well-trained, knowledgable and genuinely put the well-being of their patients first above anything else. I'm continually grateful I can trust them 100%.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Initially terrible experience here if its not with Dr. ROSE (She's awesome). Had a pap and women annual checkup with someone else and it was done rough and super rushed, did not even feel like a checkup more like a drive thru express.  Also got missed quoted pricing, charged $200 upfront and was told that was it, but then a $800 bill came on top of what was paid for lab tests, but I was sent out else where to get labs done too. I paid another $179 up front, overall quite expensive for cash patient. However, the staff from their office did help reduce some cost after they found out the mix up. I do appreciate that Dr. ROSE and one of her staff member cared enough to assist with fixing the experience, which gave me faith in staying with this place. Thank you Nicole.< /Review>< user>

I really enjoy having Dr. Rose as my doctor. I just went in for a check up and Dr. Rose is just so easy to talk to! She followed up on various medical items I have and addressed my concerns. She is very professional and has great bedside manners.

Her staff members are professional and courteous. They are also very helpful!

The office is clean and and updated! Overall I am really glad I found Dr. Rose and her office!</review>

<review>Ms Li addressed an issue I've been having for years that had gone undetected. She took the time to do a thorough examination and was proactive in a plan of care. As a nurse of 10 years I am highly impressed with Jennifer Li NP.  Thank you!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I am so happy I chose to come to Rose Women’s Health. Every step of my experience was enjoyable, from checking in to saying thank you and good bye. Ms. Jennifer Li Was amazing help and made me feel comfortable and heard. Ericka, their receptionist, greeted me with authenticity and made me feel truly welcomed in their environment. Their nurses also helped guide me and feel better during my procedure. Thank you so much to everyone at Rose Women’s Health!

Wonderful and compassionate medical staff -- I always have a great experience. BUT I do wish they were a little more organized on the administrative side -- it is always nerve-wracking when they are not sure what your insurance is going to cover, or give you a referral to a specialist or tech who does NOT accept your insurance, or when you don't receive any bills (by letter OR email) for months and months and then find out you have an outstanding balance at your next ANNUAL exam. These are not all my own personal experiences; some are the experiences of my friends and colleagues who also use this clinic, but they have happened repeatedly... Ultimately, these things turn out okay because my friends and I are privileged/fortunate enough that an unexpected $30 or $50 charge doesn't destroy our finances. But it can add up, and not everyone is in that situation.

All-in-all, Rose Women's Health does the most important things 100% right: quality medical care, clear medical information and instructions, compassion and thoughtfulness. It's just the billing and handling of insurance that is a little vexing.</Text>

<text>I love coming here. It takes me about 40 minutes in traffic to get there for a morning appointment but it’s worth it. With my schedule it’s hard to get an appointment with Dr Rose who I love but I can get in to see Jennifer who is great. The entire staff is always so nice and welcoming. They remember you even if you’re only in once a year. Also, Azi goes above and beyond to be helpful with anything I need. Definitely my favorite out of all my doctor’s offices by far.</text>< time>

I went to Rose Women’s Health, and saw Ms. Li for Botox injections. Everyone I met there was pleasant and professional. Ms. Li was very good at listening to the kind of results that I wanted from the Botox, and tailored the injection areas and amounts to achieve that result. She was very gentle with the injections, and I couldn’t be happier.<//Text>

Dr Rose was booked out 3 months so I agreed to see the NP, Jennifer Li. I found the front office staff to be typical of most Dr offices: disgruntled with any patient interaction. The nurse was nice enough, but I was a little put off when she joked that I wanted to make sure I didn't have any more children since I have 2 already. I have not made that decision yet and found it highly unprofessional. The NP was nice but she didn't spend much time talking with me and seemed in a rush to get out the door.</text>

< review>
I was a patient of Dr. Rose about 12 years ago when she delivered my first baby. Fast forward to two years ago, I was happy to have found her again,  this time in her own practice. She just delivered my third baby about 7 weeks ago. I was very scared about having this baby via c section (first c section) but I felt very safe in her care. She is very knowledgeable and confident in her work which makes me feel secure as her patient. I highly recommend her both for her expertise as well as her excellent bedside manner. The office staff is very friendly and helpful as well and I know that if I have a question,  I always receive a response in a timely manner. NP Jennifer is great as well :)<//review>

I saw the RN, Jennifer Li, at the office.  She is knowledgeable and spent time to explain the report and made a plan for future treatment.  In case of urgent matter, the office is nice enough to schedule you an early appointment.  The front desk people are very friendly and helpful.  Looking forward to have a long term relationship with this office.<//text>

I was extremely impressed with Nurse Practitioner Jennifer Li.  I was looking for a new gynecologist and was told Dr. Rose is excellent. But, when I tried to make an appointment,  I found she was not accepting new patients. That's a good sign as she is busy and her waiting room had many pregnant women who looked very happy to be there.

A friend suggested that since I just wanted an annual check up that I should make my appointment with Jennifer Li, a Nurse Practitioner in Dr. Rose's office. I had never considered going to a Nurse Practitioner before, but my friend recommended her so extremely highly,  I decided to make my appointment with Jennifer.

Yesterday was my appointment and I have to say, I LOVE Jennifer Li. She is adorable, extremely friendly, made me feel totally at ease which is saying something when you are in the stirrups, and she was completely upbeat and made me feel she was very pleased to have met me. She was efficient and explained everything she was doing. It almost made having a pelvic exam a delight just to be around her cheerful personality.

When I got home, I told my husband that I sure wish Jennifer were around 30+ years ago when we were having our kids. I would have loved to go to her for my monthly check ups.

So, if you are debating as to whether to use a Nurse Practitioner, have no fear with Jennifer Li.  I know you will like her as much as I do.< /review>

I started with Dr Rose as my gyn years ago when she was part of a group practice and enjoyed her care so much I followed her to where she is now. I am now under her care for OB services and she has been wonderful, along with nurse practitioner Jennifer Li. I feel confident about my pregnancy journey and trust that I’m in great hands thanks to both of them. My fiancé and I look forward to our office visits because the staff is always so nice and welcoming.< /Review>

Love Dr Rose! Have had great experiences with Dr and all of her staff.  They are very knowledgeable, professional, and caring!

Took my daughter in for a visit with Jennifer Li (NP) and was extremely happy!!!  Jennifer was very informative and she was very easy to talk to.  She took her time with us and wanted to make sure we understood everything.  I highly recommend this entire office for all your gyn/ob needs!!</Review>

I really like the online texting reminders of my appointment and the option to change it as well as the follow up text which gave me a summary of what the doctor and I talked about. Excellent use of technology to enhance patient care!  I highly recommend Dr. Anya Rose’s practice!<//Text>

<review>I am always taken at or very close to, my appointment time. The staff is all very friendly, front, nurses, nurse practitioner and doctor. Dr. Rose took a conservative approach to my health, rather than removing a cyst from my uterus and possibly affecting my uterus, she dealt with my issue with tact, knowledge and skill. When my husband and I wanted to conceive, we had no problems and are now pregnant with our 3rd. I would recommend dr Rose to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, mellow, confident OBGYN. She never seems hurried yet she keeps everything running smoothly<//review>< resp>

Dr. Li was wonderful and easy to talk to--she's very attentive, engaged, and knowledgable.  I had a number of questions and it felt more like a conversation rather than a doctor giving pure medical advice. I was honestly looking for another OB/GYN--just wasn't feeling particularly connected with the OB/GYN I saw the previous 2 years.  But with the timing and late in the calendar year, I wasn't able to book an appointment with some GYN's that were recommended by friends...and I eventually just booked with Rose Women's Health since I am a returning patient.  Glad I did, and glad I was able to see Dr. Li!< /Text>

I was reluctant to see a doctor I am a senior citizen that had suffered with a cystocele for years, I didn't know that this lovely vibrant clinic with these beautiful young women took elder patients! They did,and I am so HAPPY, they are so nice and knowledgeable and immediately made me feel at ease, Dr. Rose is awesome, she took care of my problem so quickly I could hardly believe I had suffered all those years. Am so grateful for Dr. Rose, there ARE great doctors,and she is one of them! What a great clinic and team, thank you ladies you're the best.with love and gratitude, evelyn<//Text>

Finally found the right OB/GYN after my previous one has retired. Friendly staff. Clean, warm and cozy office. And of course Ms. Jennifer Li (Nurse Practitioner)has done a thorough exam process and explained very detail for my condition. Thank you.
p.s. New patient has to wait 3 months in order to see Dr. Rose, wait time to see the Nurse Practitioner is approximately 1 week  (this cause I took 1 star off)<//Text>

<Text>My 3 daughters and I have been long standing patients with Dr. Rose and have experienced only the most professional and highest standard of care. Her caring and compassionate character mixed with her desire to see women achieve optimal health is very apparent. She and her office staff are always kind, pleasant, and accommodating!< /Text>< Name>

Dr. Rose is hands down one of the best OBGYN I have ever been too! Look no further,  you are in excellent hands with Dr. Rose and her incredible staff! I currently am pregnant with my first child and she has been absolutely amazing throughout the process. You can genuinely see and feel that she deeply cares for her patients ultimate well-being at all times.</Text>

<text>The entire staff is amazing! I will always know Dr. Rose saved my life from a horrible OBGYN who was going to deliver my first child. They listen and are intentive. She was always available when I had questions or concerns, since I did have some from having two miscarriages prior. She also delivered my friend’s babies as well. And the nurse practitioner Jen Li is amazing. She is wonderful also! As long as you go to this office you will always be in great hands!</text>< Pictures>

<text>Dr. Rose and her staff were recommended to me by my best friend. I was unhappy with my previous OB and upon finding out I was pregnant started using yelp to find a new one in my area, however everyone I called couldn’t get me in until after 12 weeks (this made me uneasy as I had miscarried previously right before the 12 week mark so I wanted an appt before then to ease me a little). I called Dr. Rose and they got me in at 8 weeks! Most of my appts were at 7:00am before work and coming from Montclair, she was definitely worth the hour+ drive! She was attentive, friendly and always available and open to answer any questions I had (being a first time mom). Upon getting closer to my due date she had a feeling my little one was going to be a bit on the bigger side so she sent me for a growth scan. Baby was measuring 4 weeks ahead in size and she recommended a C-Section (which was scheduled for the following week-5 days before my due date and thank goodness for that because baby came in at over 10 lbs! She had her NP Jennifer Li there to assist her (I saw Ms. Li a couple times during my pregnancy and she was knowledgeable and wonderful as well). I am so thankful for Dr. Rose and her staff and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a new Dr.< /text></record>

My previous Dr dismissed my symptoms and even dared to say that I was crazy.
In an act of desperation, I yelped top OBGYN in Arcadia and Dr Rose topped the chart, I scheduled an appointment knowing that my consultations would be out of pocket because she was out of network.
Money Well Spent -under score-
On my first visit, she immediately ordered several tests and by my second visit she told me what was wrong with me. Turns out I was not “crazy”.
Dr Rose performed a total histerectomy on Feb 16,2018. She was at the pre-op unit on time, she spoke to me before the operation and when in the operating room we talked some more until the anesthesia took effect. Her down to earth caring demeaner, put any nerveousness I might have felt at ease. I knew I was in excellent hands.
Dr Rose checked on me the two days I was hospitalized, her visits where not rushed, she made sure to check my incision and answered any questions I had.
I am finally on the road to much better health thanks to Dr Rose.
Therefore, Based in my personal experience with Dr Rose, it makes me wish more doctors had the same level of professionalism, care & humanity as she does. I cannot praise her and her staff (specially Nicole) enough.
I highly recommend her.</text>
