I've been servicing my car with them for around 3 years now. They do a pretty good job at keeping everything running well, and  generally take their time to explain why certain repairs are required if things start malfunctioning. Labor charges seem about par for the state (which is to say not cheap, but things rarely are in CA)

Do keep in mind that they don't exactly do appointments, rather they operate more like a first come first serve business, so be sure to call ahead, or if dropping in, do so early, before 9 30.< /Text>

When I bought tires at a different place, the service tech told me I only had 1 -2% left on the brakes and asked if I wanted them to replace them. I told him no and took my car to Airport Motors.   Jeff at Airport Motors said I still had 15,000 to 20,000 miles left on the brakes!!!  I love Airport Motors!  They are one of the few honest repair shops around!<//Review>

Super amazing service! I was having a breakdown because I couldn't figure out why my car was freaking out, and Justin helped walk me through it calmly and was very good about not overselling different car repair pieces and services - as a young female who's been told to be wary about car repair places taking advantage of my own car illiteracy, I was quickly eased and confident in their service and knowledge. 10/10 and definitely will continue to recommend! Especially to young university women worried about car shops: you can trust Airport Motors.<//review>

So happy to have found a mechanic I can trust and rely on in Santa Barbara. They go out of their way to explain any issues with your vehicle and lay out each action plan. I always feel confident that they are presenting me with the best options and quoting a fair price! Can't recommend highly enough.<//review>

Took it to Meineke and Firestone and both gave different reasons as to why the AC had stopped working and quoting varying amounts of over $500 for one part up to $1500 for everything. Took it to Airport Motors today. They advised the AC fuse had been blown (most likely from Big Brand's Coolant Flush overloading my AC system). $80 bucks out the door. Boom. Problem solved.

<text>Jeff, the owner, is the most nice and honest mechanic that I have ever meet in my life. I totally recommend his business to anyone. A few days ago we found that some work he did was not needed, the problem was something else, and he offer, out of the blue, to fix the car for free in the future as a way of refund. He basically told me "I need to do the right thing, it that simple."< /text>< gmapID>

I take my Prius here, and they do a great job - also, Jeff and his son Justin will only do the work that is truly needed.  If you don't need service right away, they will tell you so (for example, my front wheel bearing was making noise - it took about 40000 more miles before Jeff finally said it was time to replace it - and he gave me the best price in town).

I did see a few very negative reviews here - and believe me, I'm an engineer, so if there was anything to be concerned about I would not return.

This is honestly the best garage I have ever taken my car to.<//text>

My wife and I have been customers at Airport Motors for more than 15 years. We've had at least 25 repairs done there. Jeff has always done an excellent job at a reasonable cost. He and his sons are 100% honest and are excellent mechanics. Just today (when I took the car in for a starting problem) they found a metal flap under our car that has been rattling for 3 months and bent it back so it doesn't rattle anymore. What a relief! They just did that as an extra service @ no charge. We've used many of the other vendors and services that Jeff refers us to (for smog, tires, etc) and have always had a good experience. He really cares about his customers and will often go to great lengths to make sure we're not inconvenienced. Everyone we've talked to that uses Airport Motors has said the same, so I don't know where the negative reviews above are coming from. In fact, that's why I wrote this review (never done it before) because I'd like to try to undo the injustice if possible.<//review>

I can't even begin to tell you what a great shop this is!  Jeff has never failed to give us fantastic service. His rates beat everybody else's for miles around.  He's always given us a very clear description of our car's problem, and has treated us in the most friendly manner. Jeff loves his work and you can tell! Absolutely recommended.< /Review>

I have been working with Jeff for over 7 years and his sons.  Time after time I've needed little things done and Jeff has done it graciously and quickly...sometimes without a charge.  Apparently there are some bad reviews here, and I can say that I haven't always loved Airport Motors, but after the quick light bulb fix and battery clean up that he did the other day (for no charge) I  had to come on and leave my two cents.  I recommend them.</text>

I just called to ask for a quote for a radiator change.
The quote seemed a bit much so I asked what the quote will be if I put in the radiator coolant myself.
He proceeded to tell me, "I think you need to deal with somebody else" then hung up on me.
I'm never calling them again.< /review>

BEWARE.  I called up asking for an estimate for a smoke test to find a leak in my car and was told "I don't work that way, dude, take your car somewhere else."

After reading the other reviews, it sounds like they don't like you doing any of your own work and will refuse to work on your car if you do.  Probably easier to get more money out of people who have no idea what they're talking about.  Very sketchy if you ask me.< /Text>

I have taken my Jeep out to Jeff at A.M.on several occassions. This man is so very honest. If you dont need a tuneup:he will tell you so.I actually had to convince him that I owed a $40 balance at one point. He has maintained my Jeep for the last seventy some odd thousand miles. Not even a hiccup inbetween!</Review>

Awesome service and honest, straightforward advice.  Literally the mechanic I have been seeking for 40 years.</Review>

< review>
The owner is very rude and impolite. Once,  I took my car and he diagnosed a repair. He was totally unprofessional, just gave me a short explanation of the diagnostics. Then, he left my car outside of the garage with open doors and key inside the car (he does not know even 101 of customer service).
I decided to not do the repair at that time. After a few months, I wanted him to do the repair that he diagnosed and he refused it. Even worse, he hung-up the phone. It was the first time ever I saw such a horrible mechanic.</review>

<Review>The woman who took our order and made our food was so sweet! She was being very careful around Covid and took all orders outside. She worked very quickly so we only waited about 5-8 min for two hot items. The food was delicious - very flavorful, cooked and toasted perfectly, and made to order. My boyfriend got a Reuben and it came with a good amount of meat. I got the Spicy Denver bagel sandwich and it came out very hot with a lot of filling!
I hope more people go support this little business, her positivity and kindness are so refreshing (:<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Every time I’ve been there they greet me with a smile, definitely a confidence booster.  I’m an average looking guy so they’re not smiling at being blessed by my presence, it’s more likely they are friendly and enjoy seeing people.  Yes that must be it unless I am unknowingly handsome, be sure to five star me if that is the case.  Anyways good place to chill if you are exhausted from navigating the crowds in Tokyo Central.</text><rating>5< /rating>< Response>

I was wondering what to eat when I spotted the Deli and Bagel Cafe and decided to give it a try.  It's a small independent place in a strip mall with a few tables inside and a few more outside.  From the menus on the walls it looked like they did a big breakfast business but it was almost noon so I ordered a sandwich.  I got a chicken salad sandwich and ate it in my car.  The chicken salad was fresh and tasty and the bread was a match for the moist filling not falling apart half way through like a cheap supermarket bread might. It came with a cold crisp dill pickle spear and some of crunchy home made chips. The guy that took my order was cool and the woman that made the food was fast.  It's a good place to eat.</Text>

<Review>Wow. Great find. Was early for a nail appointment and walked across the street to find this gem. They use boars head for their sandwiches. Super cheap! Got an amazing club sandwich with fresh fruit and a pickle for 9$! Has outdoor seating even with a kids table and some doggie treats. The bagels seemed to be a hit even though I didn’t get one</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf672acc2a7d:0x7eff086e5d52c2dd</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Bagels are great, toasted is the way to go. They have over 10 different selections of cream cheese and they are generous with the amount. If its too much you can just take some off. The combination of the warm toasted bagel and cream cheese is great.< /review>

The service was so great, the employees were very welcoming and friendly.  the bagels all looked amazing, it was hard to decide which one to get.  I ordered the bagel with lox and it was delicious.  The coffee was delicious as well, and they had four different roasts and flavors to choose from, plus a decaf.  Bright, welcoming interior and a cute outdoor patio as well.  I highly recommend this spot for breakfast, lunch, or just coffee!  Can't go wrong with whatever you go with.<//review>

Nice place for a bagel. Hooe you are not in a hurry when you come to this place. Service is slow. They pile on the crene cheese too. Even when you tell them light creme cheese its way too much.< /Review>

<Text>I want to start off by saying I love this place and this review is more of a complaint if anything. I work at 6 am most of the week and I love this places bagels,  so I decided to go in at 5:30am when the shop was scheduled to open. To my surprise it wasn't open. That's okay I was willing to wait a bit but it ended taking 20 minutes to open and I didn't get my bagel  until 5:55 leaving me 5 minutes to get to work. I don't know if this was managements fault by not Giving the employee enough time to open or it was the employees fault for not opening on time. I'd really like to go every morning, so if you guys could open on time that'd be great!<//Text>< response>

<Review>Just got back home after leaving to visit this place after it moved locations.  Walked in and there's only 3 flavors of bagels left.  At 11:30am.  On a weekend...  Pretty sad to call yourself a "bagel cafe" with that kind of selection.  Spent a few minutes looking at the menu and weren't even acknowledged.  Ended up leaving hungry and going home.  We won't be back.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dcdf672acc2a7d:0x7eff086e5d52c2dd<//gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<text>I went to this place for the first time this morning. Begals were really good until we got home. All 3 of us got super sick. My father almost had to be taken to Dr.
I called place just now, asked to speak to manager, someone hanged up on me. I attempted to call back 3 times, and phone line was switched to fax line.
Would not recommend this place at all.</text></record>

This is my spot when ever I am in costa mesa I always get the veggie sandwich it is the best veggie sandwich I have ever tasted and the chips that cone with it are really good the only thing I don't like is that they give you very little chips but in the end after I'm done eating im happy I didn't eat a lot of chips , I've also tried the pizza bagel on day I was feeling like eating something greasy and it was delicious.<//Text>

The bagels here are great and I love supporting a local businesses but the service is abhorrently slow. On a bad day I have waited 15 minutes for 2 bagels when 1other customer was in the shop. I have never seen a single employee, besides the asian woman I assume to be the owner, work with even the slightest sense of urgency.< /Text>

<Review>Went out my way to get a bagel here as opposed to a chain restaurant. Bad idea. Got all the way home and opened the wrapping to discover a completely burned bagel. Really?! any moron should have known not to serve a burned food item. Really disappointing.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf672acc2a7d:0x7eff086e5d52c2dd</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dumb.  First of all if you can't understand English then why are you working the cash register? Second,  you serve espresso drinks but you don't understand what decaf is?  I could only get a decaf coffee at their sad little coffee bar.  Unprofessional,  not clean,  bad costumer service.  Bad decision altogether. First time there and also our last time there.  I'll drive across town to go to Shirley's.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>My family has always loved coming to Williamson wines. Whenever we visit, we feel like we're family here. The staff is so incredibly friendly and funny. The food and wine pairings are also fantastic. The truffle salt on cheese pairing is probably my number one fave. I highly recommend a visit if you're ever in the Healdsburg area.< /Review>< pics>

So why am I giving it a 1 star, because we were talked into joining their wine club after having a rather nice tasting experience. I forget his name, but the son was really good and explained to us that our membership included a tasting party, where we come to pick up our wines and then taste the wines in our shipment and sample other cheeses and foods. This sealed the deal. Nothing else was said.

Then the truth was discovered when I called about going. You see, only tell you in their emailed newsletter that it is very limited and to make your reservations immediately. Guess where I found that email, exactly where it should be - in my spam folder. When talking to the lady on the phone, she explained that their May events (every Saturday) where booked pretty instantly in February and the for the next tasting party, which is in October, I should be watching everyday in September for the announced dates and be on top of making my reservation.

Yeah. No. This is not the Oscars. This is a tasking party.

I should have realized joining their wine club was too good to be true. All scams are. When I expressed my displeasure with this and that I was sold that we would be going to the tasting parties, and that now,  I would just come pick up my wine, the lady then had the audacity to sell me on coming in for a wine tasting, and food sampling, at the reduced price for members. So instead the promised event where I would be able to taste the wine and sample the cheeses, I am now being sold the line to pay for it. This is such a racket.

I will NOT be renewing my membership, that is for sure.<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1620243524340, 'text': 'Bryan, when you joined our club last November we sent you a welcome email with a listing of the 150 events we provide for our members and asked you to “reply” to our email so future emails would not end up in your “spam ”folder.\nSince you did not respond to our email, in January we sent you a card via USPS.\nIn March you asked us to hold your shipment because you were out of state which we did and we replied to you then as well.\nOn April 12 we published our May Party schedule on our website and on April 27 we sent you an email to remind you that we had twenty-three Saturday and Sunday events and six weekday events for you to choose one to attend with our compliments.\nSo in May, with twenty nine party venues to choose from, you could not find one to attend, even though vacancies still exist for several parties.\nThe reason to join a wine club is to gain access to wines you like at a reasonable price instead of playing supermarket bingo.  We offer complimentary parties as added value for our members, not an incentive to buy our wines which consistently sell out every year, all on their own merit.\nSorry if we appear “too good to be true”, but we actually are real, genuine and authentic.  We simply believe that wine and food should be a source of fun and friendship, bringing people together.'}</Resp><name>Bryan Hughes<//name></record>

As someone who is not a wine drinker with a bunch of non-wine drinkers, Adam was an excellent guide. We went for the experience of going to a wine tasting, and the wine and cheese pairing was enjoyable. He was quirky and gave us a great background on how the wines were created. Btw, the bacon jalepeno jam was excellent.</Text>

This was our favorite wine tasting of the whole day! They do a wine and cheese pairing and it was so good. It really brings out the flavor of the wines and it’s always nice to have some food and drink. We loved it so much we bought a bottle and even their truffle cheese. Which is the best! We also got the truffle salt as well. Definitely should hit up Williamson if you are in downtown Healdsburg or any where close!< /Text>

<Review>Awesome experience. I took a spot at the bar and had a blast with my initial wine tasting. Came back a second day for another round and introduced a friend. The small bites pairings make all the difference. The staff is very knowledgeable and the owners are on sight as well and working (from Sydney, Australia)!!  Parking can be tight with on street parking but can usually get within 2 blocks.
They have tables as well as bar standing area - tastings are FREE!!  HIGHLY Recommend 🍷💙<//Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Many of the wineries are only offering tastings Thurs-Mon right now. I scoured the web and found this place in downtown Healdsburg. They offer a wine and cheese pairing. We enjoyed all four wines (plus a bonus taste), although only two enough to buy. We didn't buy any of the four cheeses or mustards, but I'll remember those for future trips. And our host, British Mark, was congenial and fun.< /text><date>1597241572089</date></record>

Everything was so thoughtfully planned and executed - each time a new wine and food pairing were brought out I was surprised how much they complimented each other.

So... Tell a long story short, now a wine club, cheese club, and spice club member.  It's that worth it.<//Review>< GmapID>

<review>This is a not-to-miss spot for wine tasting in Healdsburg! Their wines are second to none, and they offer amidst every varietal you can think of.. from sparkling to dessert, there's something for everyone. They also pair each wine with cheese and a condiment that's complimentary to the wine you're tasting. Mustards, pepper jams, truffle salt- and they sell each of those in their tasting room, so you can recreate your tasting experience at home! I have become famous in my circle of friends for having amazing charcuterie platters because I serve many of the special condiments I've procured at Williamson!< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x8084173165e499e3:0xa1ffed44c6998e81< /Gmap_id></record>

Very friendly staff and great tasting experience! The tasting room associates really focus on you and give you their undivided attention through food and wine pairings. The wine was so good, and the food was equally amazing. Went home with a bottle and two food items. Would definitely come again!</Review>

This is where you want to taste wine. I've never done a wine/food pairing, so this was a new experience. Fun, friendly staff. They have you sample gourmet food products that you can purchase on site (mustard, jams sauces) that truly highlight their wines.</Text>

Absolutely convinced that the wine, cheese pairings, ambiance, and loving customer service makes this place my new go to in Healdsburg.  Thank you Dan for taking such great care of us and letting my 18 month old toddler lounge while we sipped Pinot.</review>

Awesome experience.   Excellent staff. Tony was stellar.   Terrific wines.  Pairings were enjoyable.   Glad we stumbled on this place.   Joining the wine club was smart based on the  selection of wines we chose, especially for the money we spent.  Check them out.<//text>

<Review>Met here with some friends as our starter place for the day.  Quite the experience.  Wine pairing!  Great service by Tony.  Great wine and great food.  That bacon jam rocks. We got here early, so I got a place to sit down.  This is quite unique and quite relaxed to really enjoy some tastings and learn a bit as well<//Review>< Rating>

I walked in here with no reservations on a Friday night (risky, I know) but was treated with the utmost hospitality despite being a party of 1 seated at a 4 top table (cringe). The wines and pairings were extremely good and at an affordable (compared to Napa) price point. Kudos to this business for grade A customer service and an excellent tasting experience. Definitely planning to stop by again when I come to town.</review>

We have been wine club members for over 10 years at Williamson.  They have fun, knowledgeable people and great wine. We love learning about food and wine pairing. They do an excellent job of showing how food and wine compliment each other.  We were at the club party last weekend and had a chestnut soup paired with their Grenache!  Wow!  And they even share the recipes on their website.  Thank you Dawn and Bill for your great wines and hospitality!</Text>

We booked a food and wine tasting in advance of our visit to California wine country.  We had never attended an event like this, so we had no prior expectation.  It was fabulous!  The food was excellent, and our host was extremely knowledgeable about the pairings (what to pay attention to with each course).  We learned a ton!  It’s well worth the money (we actually had a Groupon...this opened the door to an entirely new experience.  Highly recommend Williamson!</text>

<Review>One of the few wineries that still offers free tastings. Do limited production so the wines they are pouring are always changing. They also do a cheese and sauce pairing with each of their wines. Definitely worth a stop if you're in downtown Healdsburg. I ended up getting their Zinfandel and Shiraz.< /Review><user>103375210164006402994</user>< pictures>

This was our favorite winery for tasting and experience.  George was a great host and he gave us his full attention.  We enjoyed the complimentary wines that were paired with cheese that was topped with different spices, sauces that really did bring out the best in the wine.  The wines we tried were all good unlike some of the wineries we visited were we usually only enjoyed a couple at best.

I would recommend this winery tasting room to anyone visiting and walking around the plaza which was a highlight of our trip.<//Review>

<review>This was hands down our favorite tour in our NoCal tour. Tony was excellent with a joke and a quick pour whenever we needed. Incredibly knowledgeable staff with a solid wine collection. The tasting was free, and we didn't feel pressured to buy anything after. I would absolutely go back.< /review>< pics>

Been here a few times with my wife and I. The wine is good, but the manager with short hair definitely needs some people skills. She is extremely rude. We just brought a group of 25 in and all 25 people said the say thing. Extremely rude. Terrible service. DO NOT GO HERE unless you like getting treated like garbage.< /Text>

<Text>A must for any wine traveler in No Cal. Their location is very convenient to access off Highway 101. Try their Pinot Noir, it will immediately become the highlight of your trip. Staff is always a delight to chat with, and I'm sure to leave with a box full of wines to last until my next visit. Happy to support such talented winemakers. Highly recommended</Text><rate>5<//rate></record>

One of the best experiences and hidden gems withing Sonoma and Healdsburg.  I came here for the first time back in 2013 and loved it to much I knew I had to come back this year.  We briefly met one of the owner's Dawn at the event room and she quickly greeted us with a smile.  The tastings were being held at the tasting room that night and she gave us directions and wished us a happy tasting.  The ONLY reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because we arrived at the tasting room that night at 6:15pm and were told they were closed and finishing their last tasting.  I understand their tastings are intimate but we could've ran through the wines in 15 minutes easy.  Despite the minor issue we made it back around 4pm the next afternoon and had an amazing tasting with Tony and I ended up with yet another bottle of Ravish Melange (right bank Bordeaux replica.)  If you like french style reds that are age worthy DO NOT skip Williamson Wines.</text>

The best ever wine in all of sonoma and napa. I was so sold on it i got a wine club membership here. The australian owners, mr. williamson, himself and his wife run this shop and make their own wines. best part they come with food pairings and they narrate how the food and wine fit together in your mouth as you taste it. it's quite an experience you won't forget.<//Review>

I went to get my Tacoma weighed here because the DMV said I needed to but the woman I spoke to did not want to help. She claimed that I needed to give her a form. I looked online and contacted the DMV and there is no form. The location I goto is supposed to provide a certificate that I take back to the DMV.< /Text>< Pics>

Needed a weight on my pickup truck for the DMV and this place has a certified scale. Took about 5 minutes and $60 and I had the paperwork. Easy access off Sierra Highway and the scale is open until 9pm.< /text>

Gas station is fine, however I did not pump gas as they do not accept credit cards for payment. They only take cash or debit cards. While respecting their decision, I do not routinely use either, so rated them lower because of the inconvenience.< /text>

It was fine. I got gas. Used a debit card, so no human contact! A 35 cent charge for using a card. 🙂< /review>

Cannot use a credit card. Cannot use bathroom. The clerk is either rude or so bored she doesn't have it in her to greet her customers and be helpful.< /text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>I went to this Arco low on gas. The pump was not recognizing any card, so I pressed the Help button and again nothing happened. I eventually went to notify an employee of the malfunction and was told that "the machine is working perfectly" and I could go around the corner for gas. He refused to look at the machine or even listen to me.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Text>The gas station was fine and the man was very nice but the area is horrible! There's people living under the freeway right next to the gas station and the McDonald's across the street is full of homeless and fire engines or we were there. The owner said that it's gotten better since Covid 18 because a lot of people left the area.We got off the freeway there but the area is just filthy and disgusting now</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>I find that the general population surrounding this area is highly unpleasant. Dealing with the transients and the egomaniacs is part of the job in this retail store. Speaking of egos, yes there is no place here for you to rest your high horse. Please save yourself the emberassment and "READ" the many signs reading "No Credit Cards" and "No Restrooms." The cashiers here are just cashiers. They don't have permits form the city to inspect the pump for maintenance. Lastly, yes there is a fee for to use your debit card here. Don't cry river over .35 cents. Get a JOB!<//Text><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

This is one of the worst gas stations I have ever been to. First off it is filthy. I once found dead bug parts on the milk cartons. The soda cans are often sticky and gross. I am also pretty sure their pumps are inaccurate. Once when I rolled in on fumes I was charged for over 17 gallons... except my truck has a 16.5 gallon tank... The employees are also always on their phone, most of the time they don't even hang up to ring you up, and often have to come out from the back.</review>

<Review>Been coming here since they opened, they got best deals out of all goodwill stores in a 8 mile radius. Cool staff plenty of parking and convenient location. Update on clothes and shoes: I understand many clothes and footwear are donations but the other day I purchased what seemed to be a decent pair of Nikes for $12.99, first day I wore them they disintegrated. My point, check meticulously before purchasing.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Beautiful place to me look more like antique store. But they need to do some work in the donation center and transportation.  Some of the merchant is broken or missing a part.

Vanessa store customer service was extremely helpful and friendly. Had it not been for her, I probably wouldn’t have bought anything but she went out of her way to see that I was happy with the service. She deserves to be recognized for her efforts. My boyfriend was also browsing for items and she assisted him equally as well.< /review>

I was not aware that they had this store just a few minutes from the border, thought it was only a donation center from what I had seen previously. Store is considerably small but you can find some good deals, parking could be a bit larger since there's very large bins taking the middle of the parking lot.< /text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Terrible attention from all the workers and the manneger puuf yelling at you and wanting you to clean the piglet of the others.

All staff are short tempered and super racist. And now they have moved

(Original)

Ideal small venue for a show. They have easy, free parking nearby. They don't serve food but have a decent wine, beer, and cocktail selection. Every seat in the house is a great one!?< /Review>

The space was large and clean.  Well set up.  The volunteers were extremely friendly and helpful.  We came to see a friend's performance and had never been here before, but would absolutely look into visiting this place again</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Came here for a jazz event for the first time and let me tell you. It was a real treat. An intimate crowd setting with some great acoustics and sound mix paired with some of the best jazz musicians in all of Los Angeles. Unlike some of the bigger concert venues scattered throughout the city, this one was cozy and memorable, creating an atmosphere where the musicians can play and interact with the audience without pretense. We had an incredible time and will be back next month for the Jazz night! Was absolutely worth the drive down to San Pedro for such a treat. And getting the table seats in the rear is worth it. Better seats and better views! Only downside is that food is not served there, only a small pop-up bar, so eat beforehand and then come enjoy the music! Highly recommend it!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE5NBWKS0YbDhUfpkcXVyL9T2PUm5tpc4oUXiI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4uMVKb8N0Un8ddHyPwFMyyKU_QRqh7_qXeUxo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyU2_MWlv2l9llGEwbquf2srQlGwUR7UV50Ygl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Great small venue to hear music.  Tonight was wonderful "the barefoot movement".   I do wish the seats had a little more padding but I really like this place.< /Review>

<Date>1517530939034<//Date><Review>I'm considering this venue for my wedding. The staff was incredibly helpful and prompt. They were actually more prompt and helpful than the standard wedding venues I dealt with. Plenty of seating for their concerts. Large stage. Dance floor availability. I've been raving about this place since my tour last week.

Their line-up is unique and non-standard. I have a friend in a ukelele/washboard/& accordion band. I think they would be very welcome in this venue. The line-up looks like something for a younger sarcastic style crowd who likes to be different while still allowing any older generations to enjoy the style and feel of each unique performance.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

<text>False advertising and continuing problems make us wary to use this service again. January 2020, we pay for a thorough heating and AC review. That failed to notice the heater was short cycling and it took awhile to get them out, do a proper diagnosis, and fix the problem. This May, we take them up on their AC review service and it seemed okay. But AC died Friday night and related calls over the weekend go unanswered. We’re told this morning that they don’t guarantee their work and the calls over the weekend are just collected and dealt with Monday morning - not sure how they can claim they offer 24/7 emergency service if they don’t even screen calls after hours. Pets and children in a 95 degree house and we’re told we may not get service for days or a week. So much for that preventative care they sold us. That said, the technicians seemed generally knowledgeable and friendly.< /text><pics>None< /pics></record>

This was our second regular service call after our initial installation and it was just like the previous ones- excellent! They were prompt and efficient. The service tech was friendly and quickly got the job done.
I am very happy with their personnel in the office who were also very pleasant to speak with as we arranged the appointment to fit into our schedule. I highly recommend Modern Air for installation, repair and maintenance of your A/C system and will continue to call on them for our system needs.< /Review>

<review>The phone operators were very friendly and so was the technician. He didn't just repair and leave he waited an extra 10 minutes to make sure it continued working correctly before thanking us for our business and leaving. Very happy with this technician and the person I spoke to on the phone.< /review>< date>

The company coordinator listened to my problems and concerns. Found an immediate opening to have our system checked and evaluated. Clearly explained our options and steps needed to get what we needed done. The technician was prompt and did a great job at answering our questions. He explained the results and showed the pictures he took. The coordinator emailed two estimates within a couple of days. Very professional company.</Review>

After a few minutes running usual diagnostic checks, the heater started working again mysteriously. He could have left at that point, but thankfully he stayed to figure out why it wasn't working in the first place. After three hours of frustration, he was able to pinpoint our issue to air flow. He explained in detail what the problem was and how to maintain good air flow in the future. The unit is working great now and I would highly recommend Modern Air, and ask for Jason.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Overall, very happy with my new 19 SEER Carrier heat-pump. While tech was testing the new unit in air-conditioning mode, I did notice the unit was working very hard. I opened the door to the closet and it then worked much better. I replace the air register in the door with an "egg-crate" style which let the air through with very little resistance. The unit would have burned up due to overworking if I had left the old register in, I'm surprised that the tech left that to me rather than taking care of it since it was such a critical matter .</Text>

<review>This is the best workout. I have been coming for almost 10 years and I haven't looked back. The teachers are friendly, encouraging, but tough. You know you'll walk out of class having worked hard. One thing I have loved about bar is being able to continue to do the workout throughout my pregnancies. I'm on my 3rd pregnancy but never felt stronger. I credit bar to being able to bounce back quickly postpartum. Not only are the instructors great but the students help to create the atmosphere.  I have met the best people and lifelong friends.< /review>< Gmap_id>

This is my happy place! It has been my home away from home for 7 years now and my obsession is still very strong. If you're looking to try a new workout or curious what Barre has to offer, check out the Bar Method Point Loma. They have variety of classes that will challenge you. The instructors are warm, friendly and knowledgeable.  But don't let their sweet faces fool you, they're tough and will challenge you to become a stronger you, physically and mentally. I'm so proud to be part of this community.< /Review>

<response>None<//response><Review>If you haven't tried Bar Method, you SHOULD! I've been doing The Bar Method for years and it is a fun, challenging workout that never gets boring. My body looks and feels great when I go 4+ times a week, but even when I can only come a couple of times a week I notice improvement to my overall health. I sleep better, eat better, and my mood is significantly improved.

But I have to say the BEST thing about The Bar Method is the people. The instructors and staff make everyone feel like family. They are so welcoming and helpful, eager to help everyone get the most out of the workout. Also, the clientele (predominantly women) are very encouraging and supportive.

No matter your age, weight, skill level, etc, The Bar Method works wonders! (There are women in their 70s who workout here EVERYDAY - incredible.) If you have injuries, you're pregnant, or you just need to start slow, the fabulous instructors will help you tailor the workout to fit your needs.

I really can't say enough good things. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. It's my little workout family :) Try a few classes. I promise you'll be hooked!< /Review>< rating>

<Review>This is the best workout I have found since I stopped taking ballet classes. The staff is warm, friendly, professional, knowledgeable and safe.
I have met life long friends in class.  I look forward to seeing everyone each morning. We encourage and hold each other accountable. Being with my Bar mates is the only reason I get out of bed at 6:00 am to go to the 7:15 class!! We walk afterwards around Liberty Station and enjoy going to movies and other social events outside of bar. The classes are challenging but the staff is there to help you. Try a month of class 3 times a week and you will see results!!< /Review><username>Carlene Hardesty Albrecht<//username><rate>5< /rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>102092723275707581925< /UserId.><resp>None</resp>< date>

<Review>I’ve been a Bar Method super fan since 2012 - I love the team at Bar Method Point Loma!!! The best bar studio in San Diego. Things that set Bar Method apart include: instructor corrections, emphasis on technique, towels supplied for class,  large clean studios and a space to shower and freshen up after class.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The Bar Method is amazing! Nothing that I have tried has ever shaped my muscles like The Bar Method. The work out hits every part of your body. The instructors are great and really make sure you are in the right form to get the most out of the workout. Trust me, within 2-3 weeks of going to class, you will see a noticeable difference in your biceps and abs!</Review>

It leaves me excited to go to the next bar method class. Also, I get one on one where if my body isn’t positioned correctly they realign me which makes all the difference. Thank you for a super experience. Well done.</Review>< Pics>

<text>Every moment at this studio is time well spent. I came as a guest and was immediately drawn in by the staff’s professionalism and attention to the client’s needs. The quality of instruction is consistently high in every class I’ve been in. The facilities are always very clean, with fresh linens and toiletries available. I can highly recommend this location, staff, clientele, and Bar instruction without any qualification. The services here are a great experience for anyone wanting to develop and maintain strength and flexibility in a positive environment.<//text>< pics>

I love working out after work. Every class is different and that's what I love. A change is good and a challenge.  All the instructors are so helpful and it amazes me how they memorize everyone's name.<//Review>

I have been going to this studio for 3 months now and absolutely love it. Even though I’m 10x stronger than I was before, there’s always a way to challenge yourself. The instructors make it a point to learn your name and help you get better by calling you out in class. There are many classes throughout the work day to fit with your schedule, as well as showers and a large powder room equipped with all the things you could possibly need to get ready. Be aware of the cancellation/ attendance policy...$10 if you miss a class you signed up for. I recommend it to all my friends and family!< /Review>

The best workout class I have ever signed up for! The staff is incredible and very personable. It feels like going to visit my friends every time I go to class (which makes waking up at 5 AM to work out much more enjoyable). The instructors are clear and kind and very helpful, and know when to push me to do more in order to be the best I can be. I LOVE THIS PLACE.<//Review>

I have been a regular at the Bar Method for over 10 years. I love everything about it. The workouts are always challenging and my body responds well to the variation of exercises. I appreciate having my form corrected because I have attended other studios and left with pains in places that should not hurt. Bar Method always has my back...and my backside!< /Review>

Definitely one of the more challenging barre workouts in San Diego and it is my favorite! The workout targets the whole body and I've seen huge results in my flexibility and it has definitely toned my body. What I love is that they have classes that cater to both beginners and regulars. Bar Move is my favorite level but I also love that they have the regular class for when I bring a friend that is new to barre. All the instructors are super sweet and the studio is very posh and clean and in such a chic location (hello, Liberty Station!) with tons of parking. Always love coming to Bar Method.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Amazing and beautiful studio!  The instructors are all so skilled, kind, supportive, and fun. They all take the time to know your name and help you along through class -  new and experienced students alike.  I have been taking classes at this studio for almost 7 years.  I have never stuck with any exercise program for this long! It never gets boring - or easier!  These classes continue to challenge my body and bring me mental, emotional and spiritual peace.  Take a class - you won’t regret it!<//text>

I love everything about Bar Method Point Loma!!  From the moment I nervously walked into my first class I felt welcomed and supported!  Julie was the instructor that first night and I was immediately hooked! My goal was to complete 15 classes in my first month and I did it!!  All of the instructors are fantastic and I have met so many genuinely nice people. After 30 days, I was already feeling stronger and seeing changes in my body.  I joined bar club and love how committed I have become.. actually planning my life around my bar classes.

Thank you so much!!< /text>

LOVE LOVE LOVE this workout, this site at Point Loma, and the staff that make it happen!   A workout designed by physical therapists for all fitness levels with strong attention to detail and individual modifications at the ready to avoid injury and strengthen bodies.  The instructors do not do their personal work out alongside you, they walk with you through the sets providing you with adjustments and encouragement. All body shapes and types welcome with enthusiasm and joy.  I'm a fan and workout here three times a week!<//text>

Unquestionably one of the best workouts I have ever done. The studio and staff are out of this world. From the time you walk into the studio, which is clean and welcoming, you feel like you are a part of a community. Every staff member takes the time to get to know your name, and makes special efforts to make you feel like "part of the family". The Bar Method instructors are knowledgeable and guide you through every step of the class. The workout can be intense, and with the encouragement, hands on adjustment to your form, and the information you are given about why you are doing what you are doing, you push through the challenge and finish the hour feeling like you have really accomplished something. I am not a "gym person". I don't enjoy lifting heavy things, and I don't enjoy the gym atmosphere. The only workout routines that I have ever stuck with have been fun and encouraging. This fits the bill for me. I have been a member at Point Loma for more that a year. I go to 3-4 classes per week, and I never feel like it is a chore. I love the community, encouragement, and the physical and mental strength I have developed. I highly recommend this workout to anyone! I'm stronger than I have ever been and I owe it to the great staff at Bar Method Point Loma!!</text>

I have been doing Bar Method classes for almost 4 years now and love how well it complements my other workouts!  The workout is great for thighs, glutes, arms, back, calves, and core.  It can be an intense workout but very effective.  I LOVE my workouts at Bar Method, especially Cassie's classes.  Level 2 class rocks!< /Review>

Not many guys do Bar Method, I think that's a mistake. As an avid skateboarder Bar Method has enabled me to skate more often and get injured less frequently, and it's not because I'm falling less! :) Bar has made me significantly stronger, more flexible, resulting in less strains and sprains, and (due to the enormity of push ups and shoulder work) less likely to dislocate when I slam! Every instructor at this Bar Method studio works diligently to refine their craft to ensure you can bust your own butt! Once you get to the advanced classes, that's when you'll learn to love the struggle!.. It's real! Thank you Bar Method for making me better at everything!<//text>< Rating>

<text>Love the workouts, environment and staff! Everyone is amazing! Coming from a background of high intensity workouts it was hard at first to wrap my head around the small- precise moves that focus on each muscle group BUT the results have been apparent after just a couple weeks. Posture has improved substantially and muscle definition has been exciting to see! I feel strong and lean.  I also just had my 4th knee surgery and nothing I have done at BAR has negatively effected my knees, only made them feel stronger with no pain.  The instructors are friendly and constantly helping with posture corrections.  You can tell they care, plus I've seen all of them take class as well so they walk what they preach!</text>< Pics>

I LOVE Bar Method! As someone who grew up training in dance, I’ve tried a few different barre classes and I believe that Bar Method still stands as the safest and most effective workout of its kind. The classes will definitely have you quivering and feeling the burn in many places, but several modifications are offered if you have any injuries, sensitivities, etc. Instructors regularly go around the room to check everyone’s form, which may take some getting used to, at first; however, I’ve found this very helpful in performing the more technical moves correctly and preventing injury.

The Point Loma location is beautiful — two studios with lots of light and great views of Liberty Station, ample parking, and a personable staff who greets you by name. I’m only a month into my membership but I will absolutely be renewing for next month and many more to come!<//text>

<text>Bar Method has been the only work out that I can stick to on a consistent basis! Not only is the work out super beneficial and effective, it's also the best atmosphere that I have ever found in the fitness industry. I not only felt part of the Bar Fam when I first started, but this feeling only escalated when I became a bride and they helped me get in the best shape of my life for my big day. I can't say enough about this method of working out, but I wouldn't change my Bar Method Babes for ANYTHING!!!< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Been coming for over a year. The workouts are always challenging and fun. The barre-tenders (isnt that cute?) are amazing. They keep the class motivated and entertained throughout the entire workout. They're always there to give you that little mental push to keep going when you think you can't. I have seen my flexibility and physical (and mental) strength grow so much. Not to mention the leaner limbs and lifted tush. I absolutely love bar class and especially working out with the bar babes at The Bar Method Point Loma< /Review>< Pics>

<text>I had been wanting to try Barre classes for a few years, but for some reason was dragging my feet. I recently started classes at the Point loma location, and wished I had started sooner. The instructors are amazing, and push your limits in a motivating and encouraging way. They focus on making sure your posture and movements are correct, so that your working the targeted muscle and not causing injuries. After two weeks of classes I began to see more flexibility in my body, and am feeling stronger physically and mentally. I would highly recommend Bar Method in Point Loma to everyone. Don’t put it off, you will love it!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I absolutely LOVED being a part of this gym! All of the instructors were amazing .. the owner cares so much about her students and her staff and they REALLY whip your butt into shape (literally.. your butt) with gentle correction and this kind of coaching yiu will certainly be in the best shape of your life - the unlimited pass was such a good deal and when I signed up there was also a special for new members so it was a great way to dip my toes in!<//Text>

Great workout for all levels!  They are great at giving modifications for everything.  I have worked out here at the peak of my fitness, during pregnancy and after the baby.  They safely challenged me at every stage.< /Review>

If you haven't tried Bar Method, do it. I've tried all kinds of workouts and this is by far my favorite! The team is really friendly, very skilled, and pay attention to everyone's form, making tiny adjustments throughout class so you get the most from every move. Every age, every level. Get the most from your body and improve your outlook!< /review>

I have quit because of moving, busy work schedules, etc.  But when I leave I always gain weight and end up feeling bad.  I always return because Bar Method is the best workout I've ever had!  When I'm doing Bar Method people ask what I'm doing because I look so good, it's so worth it!!<//Review>< pictures>

The Bar Method Point Loma has totally changed my life physically and mentally. The environment is very positive and the group of people who fill the studio (employees & clients) are so supportive with open arms.

As for the classes, each workout is more challenging than the next, no matter how many times or days you attend.
All the instructors are so friendly, informative and helpful throughout the classes, which makes sense to why the body defining results begin quickly.

If you want to head to a bar “Where Everyone Knows Your Name”, Bar Method Point Loma is the place. Cheers.</Review>

Can I just say how much I LOVE this Studio. Here's my digest version on how I found this place. In 2012 I was t-boned in an intersection, this car accident left me jacked-up with pain on my right side, especially my neck. I was unable to exercise (the way I was used to) for 4yrs. When I was given the greenlight to go back to my active lifestyle, I didn't want to go back to a traditional gym/boot camp. After much research I found The Bar Method in 2016. Allison has created a wonderful atmosphere at the Point Loma location, from the fun, sassy and super friendly instructors/staff to a fresh clean studio. For me The Bar Method is kind to my body, yet challenging. I could go on and on... let me just say this, if you have been thinking about trying The Bar Method you just need to get down here and try it. You won't be disappointed!!</text>

The online schedule makes it easy to reserve, change or cancel in a pinch. So many time slots, something for everyone! The best part are the classes, instant gratification, you can feel and see the difference after just a few classes. Combines the best of everything I love; yoga, Pilates, weights, cardio and abs all at once. The instructors correct and inform throughout the workout and they know you name! I can’t imagine doing anything else.

I have been a Bar Method devotee since 2012. I took classes several times a week at the Bar Method in Pasadena for years before moving away. While living in Pasadena, I would visit my boyfriend- now husband- who lived in San Diego on the weekends and take weekend classes at the Point Loma Studio. From my first class everyone was so nice and welcoming. It felt like a second home studio.

After a couple of exercise-less year in the Bay Area,  we moved back down to San Diego a few months ago and I was excited to start going to Bar Method again at Point Loma. Getting back into the workout has been challenging, but in the best way. I love rediscovering my strength and flexibility and being part of such a friendly community of teachers and students.

It's been nice to see how the workout has evolved over the years with new exercises and options, but still routine enough to not be intimidating or overwhelming. As someone who hated exercise (and fell back into the habit of doing nothing not so long ago), Bar Method has been a savior. It is fun, approachable, convenient and EFFECTIVE. I used to not be able to even hold a plank and now I can do 30 pushups in a row!<//Text>

I absolutely LOVE the Bar Method in Point Loma! I wish I could provide 100 stars in this review, because the workout, the studio, and the amazing instructors who continue to inspire, encourage, and motivate me have literally changed my life!

I promise you have not experienced true muscle fatigue or failure until you’ve experienced Bar! Soccer, mountain biking, snowboarding, and bootcamp classes were not enough to get me conditioned for this workout. I was so humbled during my first class—my legs were shaking and quivering, and days later I felt soreness in muscles I didn’t know existed!

Although I felt a bit defeated after my first class, Alison, the studio owner and my very first instructor, was incredibly supportive and encouraging. She even sent me a hand-written note a few days later thanking me for attending her class, and congratulating me on completing my first workout. What a wonderful and personal touch! I soon came to realize I was being taught by top-notch, expert instructors, who also happen to be truly exceptional people. Alison has recruited some of the most talented teachers, and they are all unique and special in their own right. It was a new experience for me to receive so much attention and corrections on my form. I wasn’t sure how I felt about this initially, but over time, I came to understand that the corrections are absolutely essential—the teachers are there to keep you safe and free from injury, and also to ensure you get the most you possibly can out of each movement. I've progressed so much with their help and guidance. They’re very serious about giving you the best workout they possibly can, but they have also managed to create a warm, fun, and welcoming environment. You really feel like you’re a part of their community. But please don’t let their sweetness fool you! They each have the ability to murder your muscles without hesitation, so don’t be surprised if you’re dropping f-bombs under your breath. ;-)

If the challenging workout, phenomenal people, and beautiful studio aren’t enough to convince you to check out Bar in Point Loma, then let me tell you about the results. Even though I’ve been athletic my whole life, I’ve still carried more adipose on my small frame than I was comfortable with. I used to kill myself in the gym doing 2+ hour workouts, but I was always so frustrated and disappointed by the lack of results those workouts produced. I had made peace with my body for the most part, and tried to accept the fact that I just didn’t have the genetics to reach my body ideal. I committed to regular Bar classes with the goal of maintaining my health and fitness, and continuing to cultivate my physical and mental strength. I never expected to lose weight or change the shape of my body, but that’s exactly what has happened. In the 9 months I’ve been attending Bar classes, I’ve lost 22 pounds and dropped 3 pants sizes. My arms and legs are the most defined and toned they’ve ever been, and yet the heaviest dumbbell I pick up is 4 pounds! The micro-movements in Bar are so unique, and they lengthen and sculpt muscles like no other workout. I’m extremely thrilled by my weight loss, but I’m equally thrilled by my strength and flexibility gains—I can now do 60+ push-ups on my toes, and I can perform the front splits! Before Bar, I wasn’t able to pull off either of these fitness feats. This is the first time I have ever felt like the rewards I receive match the effort I put in. What an amazing feeling!

I can say, without a doubt, that the Bar Method in Point Loma is helping me live my life to its fullest potential. For anyone out there who’s still unsure or on the fence about Bar, I urge you to sign up for a series of classes at this studio. Once you’re hooked, there’s no turning back, and I promise this will be the best gift you’ve ever given yourself!< /Text>

<Review>They just updated the menu and are experimenting with pricing, the end result is great for the customer!!  The poke is fresh and hands down the most tasty of all the poke restaurants nearby.  It's in a peaceful spot at the back of the Crossroads with views of the mountains.</Review>< name>

<review>My husband and I had poke bowls that were both flavorless. I thought that with so many good reviews that it would be good, but the food was so bland. I chose the Hawaiian poke and the fish just didn't have any flavor. My husband got the albacore tuna. Both were a disappointment.<//review><GmapID>0x808de8a9a7e2fd8d:0x761795d0df1b34fc</GmapID></record>

<text>Fresh food - a bit expensive but really a great place. A bit hidden but worth finding. Lots of options besides white rice such as quinoa which is fantastic.

Also - wifi was great - so funny, to get the code - they hide it under the cash register - more secure than the $ :-)< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I wanted to like this place... because I love Poke and wanted an option that was closer than Monterey or Marina.  But I will NOT be back.  First off... the prices are INSANE high.  Totally wacky and not on par with similar poke places in the area.  I have had Poke in Monterey, Marina, San Jose, and San Francisco and never paid this much.  I get a larger serving of the exact same ingredient at Poke Lab for $7 less.  I paid $2 extra for avocado today... it was LESS than 1/4 of an avocado.  I can't imagine what the margins are on avocado at this place, let alone everything else!!
Aside from price, the taste was not great.  The ponzu was NOT ponzu... it tasted more like a strong soy sauce.  Zero lemon flavor at all.  And something in my bowl tasted of metal... I couldn't quite put my finger on which item.  Just totally disappointed with my $22 poke lunch bowl!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Im a local here and been coming to the carmel poke co. since it first open .  Great poke bowl but its just way too expensive.   I got the carmel bowel ( highly reconmended) but I added a extra scoop of Sashimi and the price was 17.50 and sky rocketed to 25.50.    Rip off!  and to top it off they close at 5 pm.</Review>

So, first off don't get me wrong the place has amazingly fresh seafood and a good selection of drinks and toppings. Also they are very ecco friendly if that sort of thing, is what strikes you. However now for the three stars. The prices are through the roof for a poke place. I went there around 4:30 pm. they were out of salmon and himachi....sigh. So my options were quite limited, so I went for the 3 scoops. I had tuna poke, spicy tuna and tako, AKA octopus, add an additional $3 for that. So for 3 scoops and a peach Tazo tea basically 30 bucks. So if your not affraid of the price check this place out. Otherwise there are plenty of less expensive options available.< /review>

I highly suggest this amazing, family owned, Japanese restaurant.
They have many options for the base, sashimi, and toppings, which you personalize to your liking. The sashimi is very fresh and delicious! The hamachi (yellow tail) was especially good and worth the extra $2.
The prices were reasonable, I paid $40 for 3 bowls, a great price for so much food. I would suggest splitting a bowl if you don’t eat a lot.
You can great a great meal quickly, and it’s really healthy too!!

All around amazing place to eat!< /review>

Dr. Esterkyn and his staff are always so informative and friendly. My son was excited for every appointment and they made him feel special. He woke this morning to a cute little surprise celebrating the removal of his braces. I would absolutely refer people here and already have.<//Review>

Really awesome! The staff have been very kind and have explained things really simply all throughout my braces experience. My friend recommended them because they did her braces, and they came out awesome for her! Excited to see the results at the end of this year.</text>

They say 3rd time is a charm.  This week I had my 3rd full set of braces put on and it was so much easier than I remember.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.  I went back already to have spacers added and had the same warm and welcoming experience.  So far, so great!</review>

<Review>My daughter has been coming here for a while for treatment. They are always really helpful and friendly. They make her feel at ease about what treatment they are doing by explaining everything and they have a fun patient hub with games and prizes. They have been really careful with Covid precautions and we feel safe coming for appointments.  We are looking forward to her beautiful smile when they are done!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Dr. Brent and his staff have really made my son feel comfortable going to the orthodontist. His smile has improved dramatically in less than a year. The staff is so nice and really take pride in great service. I highly recommend this team for your ortho needs!<//Text>< rate>

<text>My son and I love coming to their offices! Such a nice friendly environment. Very professional and welcoming! Doesn’t just feel like an ortho office more like walking in and being greeted by friends! I will continue to refer anyone here as well as continuing our own ortho at this office!

Courteous, professional, well trained staff. They make a point to get to know you and make you feel welcome. They are also following all of Covid-19 protocols to the letter and I appreciate their diligence. Dr. E is a kind, soft spoken orthodontist who is well trained in his craft. I would definitely recommend Dr. Esterkyn and his Antioch staff to anyone in need of braces.<//text>

Amazing experience with all three of my kids! Older two have completed their treatments and the youngest is in the middle of Phase 1. They are great with kids! They also have fun incentives that encourage hygiene and taking care of their teeth. I would highly recommend them!<//Review>

Delta Smiles is a good place to go when you need braces. They have nice and kind workers and they even have a rewards system so you win prizes when you get a certain amount of points. I would definitely recommend coming here.< /review>

The entire staff at Delta Smiles are very professional, friendly and accommodating. They were able to get me in quickly for ordering invisilines and even  arranged an earlier appointment since they were delivered a week before expected. This office is top-notch.<//text>

Such a sweet and inviting staff! My son Charlie S. is just in the first stages of doing his first phase of braces. Everything was explained to both of us in great detail including pictures. My son suffers from anxiety disorder and they have made him feel comfortable at every visit.  This is very important to me.  Thank you Dr. Esterkyn and staff! We are excited for this adventure in orthodontics.<//review>

Dr. B is an amazing orthodontist who helped give me the smile I’ve always wanted. After 5 years of braces, double jaw surgery, and many more I’m finally in the last stretch to having a perfect smile thanks to the amazing people and doctors who helped make it happen!</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I was referred to this orthodontist by a family friend and my dentist, so I knew I was going to be okay.
My experience with this practice has by far surpassed just okay. They are excellent people, personal and caring. Their level of genuine care paired with the level of professionalism has left a long lasting impression with me not just my smile!!! I would recommend them to not only my family and friends but anyone looking for an orthodontist in the East Bay Area! Thank you Dr. Esterkyn and team for all that you do and most importantly how you do it !<//Review><user_id>113180453987556161684< /user_id>< pics>

< Review>
I have been with Dr Esterkyn for 5 years having to bring both my daughters here and I highly recommend him to my friends and family. The office is very professional, attention to detail, and staff just treat you like family.

Kirsten A (18 years old) is so much confident with her smile, she is going to smash college.

Cheyenne A (11 years old) is very happy, can’t wait to see her teeth after her braces.

If you have any orthodontic issue, just come to him, he’ll take care of you.</Review>

From the friendliness and experience of the staff, to even Dr. Esterkyn calling us personally to check in with our daughter and how her teeth were feeling after getting the braces put in. Even the rewards card they give to the patients as a nice little incentive in keeping up with the care of their teeth. Very happy with our care so far, can't wait to see what my daughter's teeth look like after her braces. Highly recommend!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1559060908785, 'text': 'Wow, thank you so much for the kind words.

My son (Aiden P) needs quite a bit of work done and I was pretty anxious at the thought of it all. The entire process from beginning to end was clearly explained to me which left me feeling confident in my decision to proceed. Aside from that their office is clean, staff is friendly and they've all been great with my son. They even have a rewards system that has really pushed my son to want to participate in his treatment!<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1570126359118, 'text': 'Thank you for such a nice compliment.

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I love Dr. E’s team! As an adult with braces, I faced a lot of insecurity, but it was really cool to be cared for so well with every monthly visit. My case was more complex than the norm because I had a planned surgery involved, but Dr. E & the team were so patient, kind, fun, and communicative through it all. I looked forward to every visit, honestly.

Being a patient there myself and having numerous family members seek services there, I can’t recommend them enough! Consider them for yours or a loved one’s orthodontic treatment.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1565818354379, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the great feedback!'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

Dr. Esterkyn and his staff were so nice to me as soon as I walked in. I had been going to a different orthodontist before and when they looked at what he had done, they changed a lot of it because it was outdated. It was clear that Dr. Esterkyn really knew what he was doing and I am very grateful that I decided to go with them.< /Text>

It can take a while here, but the team is very friendly. Debby in particular is very nice, she has a "mom aura" and made sure everything was comfortable for me. The building is clean (and very pretty), there's an area for brushing your teeth/rinsing/using mouthwash, and I got a goodie bag after getting my braces, including an Oral B electric toothbrush, soft foods, floss, toothpaste, a travel toothbrush, floss threaders, and more. Overall it was a great experience, and I look forward to continuing my treatment with this team.</Review>

<review>Both of my sons, Cage & Cash W., are patients, and our family couldn’t be happier with the entire team. From the very start everything is explained simply, they come up with a clear plan for your patient, and have a payment plan catered to you.

Dr. Esterkyn and his staff are wonderful. From the beginning everyone was kind, caring and professional. They were very thoughtful, taking into consideration my daughters health and temperament, while designing her care plan. When the day came to apply her braces the doctor and his assistant were very patient and thorough in explaining every step of the process., preventing any anxiety in my daughter. I highly recommend Dr. Esterkyn and his entire staff!< /text>

My daughter had a braces off today and yesterday evening they put up 12 smiley faces and a congratulatory sign with pink flamingos for my daughter in our front yard!

<Text>Dr. Esterkyn and staff handled my daughters braces 5 years ago. It was not even a second thought to have him take care of my son as well. Their staff is amazing! Always kind, always cheerful, and always positive energy in the office. Also, he was very helpful in speeding up treatment for early removal. Very happy with the care given to both my kids!</Text>< rate>

I was a patient of Dr. Estterkyn when I was a teen and now my son is one also. Today was my son’s (Elijah D) first full appointment and had his first step of braces placed. Everyone from the front office staff to the back office was very welcoming and helpful. Donna helped explain every step and made sure my son knew all processes and cleaning items in his goodie bag. Soft foods, a whole cleaning kit for home and school, instructions, and reward system were given today- Dr. Esterkyn and his team are great.</review>

<text>We moved here from another state when my teen was still in braces. This office declined a request for a consultation to take over treatment and remove braces. I was told flat out that there is a $1000 fee just to remove them so it would be more cost effective to fly back to the state we came from. I wanted to get a few estimates and 2 other orthodontists in town offered a friendly/free consult and detailed plans and prices. Both of which were under $1000 and included the permanent retainer. (Dr Sheffield and Dr. Louie). My younger child who also needs braces will also be using one of them.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Both my girls have gone to Dr. Esterkyn's office.  Him and his staff have been amazing!!!  My oldest daughter suffers from anxiety and sensory issues.  They were absolutely wonderful and made the process for her very smooth.  Dr. Esterkyn does a terrific job and his staff are all incredibly kind and caring.  They came recommended to us from a friend and I'm very, very grateful!< /Review>

I am so proud of my daughter’s smile because of  Dr John Esterkyn and staff. We are coming to them almost over three years for braces.Front counter to clinical staff members are so friendly, loving and polite. We always had great service with them and strongly recommendation who wants a great orthodontist go to Dr. Esterkyn`s office.  Staff members  are very courteous and helpful. We also love the way Dr. Esterkyn does take care of his patientS. One of best Orthodontist in Brentwood!

Happy Hoildays!!

We've had three children get two set's of brace's each.  We've been going to Esterkyn's forever and we enjoy every visit.   Final results were worth it. Thanks< /Review>
