<Text>My friend and I ordered a spiced rum and Coke’s. They were awful!  Tasted like cheap rum, coke and Kahlua.  If they didn’t have spiced rum they could have just said so. $9. each and we didn’t drink them. Don’t waste your money, just walk down to Ideal’s.</Text><Rating>1<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x808e6a9991d722c1:0x7999d227987078c8<//Gmap_id></record>

<Text>This place really surprised me. It has a connected bowling alley and the food is good. If you like singing this establishment offers karaoke as well. The atmosphere is fun and people are just there to have fun. Super nice! And its right next to the boardwalk! So so convenient. A family friendly bar and grill.<//Text>< GmapID>

Let's be clear: this is a karaoke bar in a bowling alley. This is not an independent "bar and grill" and the only food here is from the food counter in the bowling alley. However, it is still a good karaoke bar option for the downtown Santa Cruz area. Many of the song versions are old and weird, but that's par for the course at a bowling alley karaoke bar. As long as your expectations are in the fight place, it's a fine place< /Text>

<text>Awesome bar. The beer on tap was a small, but decent, selection. Bottled beers appeared to be all domestic, ie, Bud and such. The cocktails were fairly unique and very well mixed. The bartenders tonight were pretty awesome and hosted a talented karaoke list. I mean, they obviously don't control the quality of the singers, but the bartender who did sing was awesome. All around a good time hosted by some cool, friendly, bartenders.</text>< Pictures>

My friend had to get up & go get that bartender for a drinking menu. Who by the way by looked as though she couldn’t be bothered to help us as she cleaned off tables. She finally gave us drinking menus and walked away. Instead of checking on us or coming back to take our order she decided to ignore us. We waited an additional 20mins before deciding to leave.

I go here for Karaoke, ussualy with a bunch of graduate students. The crowd is fun, the DJ is nice and it's decently safe. Drinks are also decently priced. There's plenty of free parking at night when the boardwalk isn't open. When the boardwalk is open parking is trash! There's some parking in the surrounding neighborhoods, but mostly it's metered or residential with a parking permit requirement.< /review>

<Review>This has to be the worst bar I’ve been to in my life came in with four people it had about 7 people in there. Idk the waitress or bar tenders name but there were two we were sitting there for about half an hour while they cleaned tables around us. A person I was with asked for the drink menu and she happily grabbed them. But that was it we proceeded to sit there for another 20 mins while the bar tenders just talked to each other.< /Review></record>

Great service, and bartender, best bacon body Mary  ever!!!(just my opinion, and I have had lots to compare it with) garnished with celery, pepper hi I, olive, onion, aspergras, green bean..and wait for it...bacon.. seriously good!!!its a sports bar , as well, lots of TV screens, there is also seating outside, with another bar serving normal drinks and summer daily drink specials ( different from the ones offered inside),, dance floor,  you may take your food and drink outside, or get served outside,..it opens to the crosswalk that opens up to arcade or sand, or sometimes volleyball courts.. it has a pet friendly eating lounge area, too ! there is also a great bowling alley housing all this good stuff, with midnight , blacklight ,bowling with music ,, and extremely up-to-date scoring machines...the full bar and usual 'alley food' + the restaurants menu is also served in the bowling area..there own parking lot( which, on a Friday summer concert being offered,parking is hard to find), so don't try to park in bowling alleys lot, your car WILL BE TOWED,if you aren't going to be IN the bar or alley.theree is parking on street , or in the adjacent lot at $15 for the day.,as well as more parking ,along the streets, ALOT OF THOSE STREETS ARE ONE WAY OR RESIDENT ONLY,, so be careful with that ,too.</text>

Had the worst experience going their tonight, usually great service. But apparently they upgraded the bar bar to serving drinks. It was super busy and I under that, you wait for 14 mins and he says nothing to you, just say, hey I will be there shortly. Nope he just took other people orders. Sucks for us becuz we live right by there. But won’t go there again</review>

<review>I was charged for a beer before it hit the bar. I had told the waitress it would be on one card and she insisted on taking 2 cards at the time (no problem). I was charged for the beers as well as the paying party. I call to try and dispute and take care of the problem and was very rudely dealt with buy a guy named Willy (POS) I was scammed (yes Willy a scam) for beer, and I assume more people have been as well. Very bad customer service and very bad way to speak to anyone, but since you hung up on me I will swing by and clear this matter up first hand!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) Hamburger combo was ok
The bathroom was very convenient and the service was good! You can make a little bit! You can choose french fries from regular, garlic or curls!

(Original)
햄버거 콤보 괜찮았어요
거기다가 화장실 이용도 편리하고 서비스도 좋았어요! 조금 짤 수가 있어요! 감자튀김은 일반,갈릭,컬 중에 고를 수 있어요!</text>

<text>Excellent service, prices, and selection. Incredibly knowledgeable staff who helped me figure out exactly what I needed. I have been a loyal customer since 2012 when I used to shop at their old location. Plenty of other shops around where I live, but I drive out here because this shop is superior to all others that I have been to.<//text></record>

Every time I walk in I am greeted with a smile by whomever is working that day!  They know what cigarettes I smoke and grab them without me even having to ask.  I won't go anywhere else in the area for my smokes!< /text>

Very friendly staff and delicious baked goods, always fresh. When I worked in the area I would stop before work to grab a cappuccino and they would always offer a sample pastry. There are Paris Baguettes all over the area but you should skip those and come here for authentic Parisian treats and atmosphere.<//review>

Delicious. Clean. Professional. Quick. Coffee is amazing, pastry...yes and the croissant is unreal. I actually went in for just a cup of coffee and ended up with a full brunch meal and I enjoy every single bite! Definitely worth stopping by. I'll be back.</Text>

This location is closed. My rating is not representative of the company. They're still open in la brea. Super easy to work with. But yeah Google stop telling people this location is open when it's not.
It makes them look bad.< /Text>

<review>Wonderful family owned cafe. If you want to have food that tastes like it’s made in France come here.
The closest thing you can get in LA and everything is incredible, especially the baked goods made w French butter & flour.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmkYNDi3w42h5jRSxaTpc8H94xIFJ4-msiZPx2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIxfc44ELlIE1c-vX3ljBcxsUWmQs7fBj4qOTK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

I love Alcove. It will always hold a special place in my heart as my husband and I went there on our very first date. The breakfast and main menu food is all delicious, the drinks are great, and the ambiance is so lovely and charming both inside and outside.<//review>

I've passed by this place a few times, and finally stopped in.  Lately I'm on a bakery hunt, and don't always feel like going to Porto's to wait in line.

Stopped in before going to work the other day for coffee and pastry, and was pleasantly surprised!  I had the chocolate mousse and my sweet tooth approved.  Will most likely come in again and try something else.< /Review>

<review>The pastries rival ones I’ve had in Paris - they’re amazing! My husband and I love coming in for croissants, especially the almond nutella and chocolate ones!

<review>Did you know combining pistachio, almond, and raspberry could be magical?

Neither did I, until I came here and tried this glorious croissant. Flaky crispy pistachio-stuffed crust (a tad too hard for my liking, but it was 2pm, and the croissant had probably been sitting for 8 hours by then), nice airy layers inside, with sweet almond and raspberry cream-paste near the bottom. Mmmmmmmm, these flavors!

Also tried a chouquette. So cute and fun to eat!<//review>< rating>

This is the ONLY place I know that makes proper espresso in LA (they use Italian coffee). The pastries are to die for. Completely authentic and top quality.<//review>

This place is tops all around! I had a wonderful smoked salmon omelette that comes with a very healthy side salad and an Earl grey tea. Both excellent! Tomorrow morning I am trying the sweets there. Philippe, who seems to be the owner, a very friendly Parisian, warmed my heart by offering some  pastry to a homeless man that was right outside. They bake everything in-house. It is spotlessly clean. If you like things French and top-quality, you must go there! Martín, from Argentina/Las Vegas.</text>

Yes the price is high, but there is no alternative for really tasty pastries nearby. The coffee is pretty good, but those croissants are beyond spectacular. The French music and clean setup gives it a nice ambiance. Definitely recommend.

My few gripes only include the high prices and the mediocre chocolate used in the choco pastries.</Review>

I work for both Doordash And Postmates picking up and delivering food for customers. This bakery coffee shop has a very nice ambiance to it. Very low keyed,nice place for a student like myself to work on essays and term papers.< /Review>

Awestruck by their Rasberry Macaron Cake.  This wasn't  a tower, it was cake for 12 to 14 people.  New to most of us and incredibly delicious w berries mixed in the creme and cake topped with an accent of mixed berries + gold leaf decoration. I was asked a number of times where I ordered it from and it was a pleasure to share the name.  Check out either site. On any day they have a wide selection of delicious pastry items both savory and sweet & many not found elsewhere.  Prices are comparable with other fine bakeries in area.  Parking @ DTLA site may be challenging.<//review>

Omfg!! Passed by and the smell dragged me in. Then tried a sample of their pecan pie... 🤤 Fortunately nobody was around cause I was about to slap somebody. Walked out with an apple and pecan pie. Was supposed to be a pumpkin and apple pie, but the guy misunderstood me. Ohh well. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Still giving  5*. Not even mad.👌🏼< /text>

Best croissants in L.A. if not SoCal!
Probably some of the best croissants and pastries you will taste without traveling to Paris or St. Tropez.
Their breakfast omelettes do not disappoint either.
Authentically French vibe with friendly and smiling French hostesses to greet you.
Go check it out now and skip future guaranteed crowds.<//review>

The croissant I had here this past weekend was simply amazing!

I passed by La Tropezienne on Saturday after lunch at Poppy + Rose and on the way to Verve. This bakery has been in my bookmarks for awhile and I've been OBSESSING over croissants lately so I knew I had to buy one for home. I got a plain croissant and ended up eating it the next day (warmed up in the oven of course).

The croissant was sooo flakey and buttery. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back this weekend to stock up (never a bad time to eat a croissant).

They have a bunch of other pastries for sale too that I will probably try the next time I go back. Highly recommend!</review>

(Translated by Google) Flaky and buttery homemade Chocolate Croissant made my morning so much more delicious! 🥐🥐☕️☕️
Ranch
Bakery brings LA's classic tradition of Viennese pastries and pastries to Los Angeles
The most famous is this man praised by everyone
The outer layer is crisp and fluffy, the inner layer is soft and dense.
Creamy fragrance from time to time makes you more chew and enjoy
The most amazing thing ... even if it's cold, it's still quite crispy! Ranch

Almond Pistachio Croissant also delicious
Strawberry tarts too

< Review>
I called and ordered shrimp pho, chicken pho, rare beef pho, and egg rolls. Due to the pandemic the food is take out/delivery only. The eggs rolls were very good. The pho was good as well, just wish there was more flavor in the broth. I will be back to try other dishes.</Review>

We came back to this restaurant for their delicious Pho for our dinner tonight. This time we ordered the pho special the broth was yummy and hot especially for this cold night. The taste was the same as usual which was very consistent and good. Service was fast and cordial, the noises were kept to a minimum, even the place was almost full. The place was clean and comfortable.</Text>

Good place for a typical bowl of pho. Nothing too special. They're large seems a bit smaller but considering their price (under $10 for the large) there isnt really much to complain about.
They do use a bit of MSG in their food and you can definitely feel it after an hour.< /review>

I have to say, this place was brought to my attention by my brother. It’s a nice cozy place with some delicious pho at a reasonable price. The servings are just right to be full and not feel too overwhelmed. Me, I like the meatballs and rare steak and I don’t mind getting a little extra of both. You have to pay extra to get more but it’s worth it. The spring rolls are delicious too.</review>

This is the best Pho I've had. We love the veggie Pho and their chicken sandwich. They always provide the best service!</Text>

Nice little pho spot. We came here after the place we intended to go was too busy. Their beef brisket pho was delicious, the broth was very flavorful. I also had some sort of roasted pork sandwich that was very good, roast pork with some delicious dressing on a roll. Their Thai tea was pretty average, nothing special but their iced tea was very mild and refreshing.</text>

<review>I just went there for the pho; I got the #1 Combo: pho w/steak, rare, spring rolls; soft drink; $9.80 ($12 w/tip).  As has been mentioned, there is very little steak, and it's not rare.  I'd call it the not quite vegan pho.  ;  )  Nevertheless, it was pretty good b/c the broth is good.  Spring rolls weren't really much either.  If I go back I'll look for chicken pho rather than steak, and only if I have a cold I guess, and am looking for some chicken soup.  Place was clean and service was fine, but there weren't many other customers. Imma keep looking for pho places nearby.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

How do you make business with the less meat and full price, service was slow, dirty kitchen with smoke inside the restaurant......If you’re craving the pho , you should go to PHO TASTE on pinioneer and south street better than this place and faster !
Don’t know why this restaurant got 4 star on the google, I fell sorry with my money to got the food from there :(((</Review>

I love it here! Two Asian ladies treat my girlfriend and I with awesome hospitality. Very polite. Also the food is delicious. I've only tried the pho combo with Thai tea boba. Eggrolls are great!The free water is also clean. So are the restrooms. I come here almost twice a month when I'm feeling some pho. A lot of positive outcome since coming here!</text>

I ordered the large rare steak pho and it had almost no meat. I complained to the waitress that there were only three pieces of meat and she took my chopsticks and dug around my noodles to find one more piece then called me a liar. There truly were only four small pieces of over cooked meat in this giant soup.
I don't know what happened. It was my second time there. The first time was very pleasant and the food was great. This time, the two servers were both surly and rude. I will most likely never return.</text>

It is a lovely festival in many ways but it would be better if certain aspects, like rides, were more affordable or allowed for some subsidy. All children should be able to enjoy not just ones whose parents have lots of disposable income.

Furthermore, some of the vendors here are adding ridiculous amounts of sugar to items that simply don't need it. These are some of the same vendors that have healthier options when the event is in a white neighborhood. Please stop making things less healthy for brown people, thank you! We are health conscious too! Here looking at you strawberry smoothie folks.</text>

Always a fun time, and its FREE to attend! Strawberry Lane is great for the kids to enjoy treats, sponsored by various local organizations...Highly recommended you go! Worth the trip to sleepy little, downtown Watsonville!< /Text>

< Review>
I made a video tour/review on my YouTube channel. Just look up "Watsonville Strawberry Festival Tour/Review - Jcruz04"

It was ok. I was expecting more extravagance revolving around strawberries, similar to how the Garlic Festival has a lot of different types of foods surrounding garlic, same for the Watermelon Festival. There was only 1 stand selling strawberries. This was more like a regular local fair/carnival with vendors selling expensive/poor tasting food. If you are looking to drive a great distance, it's not worth it.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>We have been taking our dogs to Evergreen Animal Clinic for over 5+ years. The staff is really friendly to us and extremely awesome with our animals. I also love the fact that the Dr’s follow up with us via text message as well if we have a general question that the staff can’t answer. Right now with Covid we pull up, check in by calling in and they will come out and take our dogs in whether for their annual check up, vaccines, etc. Customer service is completely stellar at Evergreen  and we highly recommend you taking your animals there too!< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Best Vet Clinic in town! They have taken care of three of my pets over the last few years. They always go above and beyond. I very highly recommend Dr McGee, she is a sweetie. Very honest about what tests are absolutely needed vs which ones they can run.<//Text>< Pics>

This has to be the single greatest animal clinic I have ever been to.  The staff is legitimately caring, and leaves me feeling like I'm in such great hands.  I just moved back from sacramento where I tried 3 different vets, all letting me down and just seeming so uninterested in my dog.  Believe me when I say, you want to bring your animal here, to be part of the family.  Since bringing my pup here his quality of life has gone through the roof!  Thank you evergreen animal clinic, you guys are the bees knees.< /review>

<Text>My family moved to Santa Maria when I was 10. Many,many years ago (late 60's).All of our dogs, cats and their litters and then all of my dogs, cats, puppies and kittens have been coming here as well. My daughters both have kitties and doggies. Where else would they take their animals? Of course to Evergreen Animal Clinic. Over the years we have seen many kind and compassionate Drs, nurses, techs, receptionists. I have always had everything explained and the next steps to be taken. Thank you all for taking such good care of our animals over that last 50 year plus! *****< /Text>< user_name>

I have been taking my dogs to Evergreen Animal Hospital since I moved back to the area last year. I have had to take them in for everything from annual checkups, vaccines, emergencies (foxtail got stuck in my dogs jaw and abcessed) and dental cleanings. The doctors and staff have always been absolutely fantastic without exception. They really care about my dogs and want the best for them. I highly recommend Evergreen Animal Clinic to all of my friends and family.<//review>

<review>Today, February 2, 2021, I took Jaxon in for an exam regarding allergies and a rash. Dr. D and the entire staff where professional, caring, and kind. Jaxon received excellent care and treatment. Dr. D took the time to discuss with me Jaxon’s health issues and recommendations to enhance his future health. I would highly recommend Evergreen and I will continue to take Jaxon for his health issues.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1612376781391, 'text': 'Thanks so much for taking the time to write such a great review Jimmy.

My family has been using Evergreen Animal Clinic for over 20 years.  They have expanded their services over the years and remain current with their practices.  The vets and their staff are helpful,  courteous and caring towards us and our pets.  They are very efficient and consistent,  especially during this time of Covid 19, while continuing to be down to earth with their clients. I highly recommend Evergreen Animal Clinic!<//review>

<Text>Nope, I should have listened to my gut & just driven the hour & half to the closest Banfield... We moved recently & this area doesn't have one (for some reason); my initial thought was, 'Oh, farm land, they have tons of pro Veterinarian offices here!' that was ignorantly positive of me.

The staff here is wonderfully friendly & positive, my issue is the lack of due diligence. I was never asked about my cats personality or general disposition, I was never told what the office visit would entail, I wasn't provided with an efficient plan of action at any time, & I do not feel that my cats individual needs were met by any means. She is not a dollar sign, she is part of our family.

We arrived 20 minutes early for our cats appointment; she was car sick & threw up (not their fault), they were super helpful about providing us with means to clean her up, however... We ended up waiting (with our car running) for about 50-60 minute's before someone took her into the office. My cat was coming in for a UTI. The entire time, my husband & I kept stressing thinking she might pee in her carrier, which was already a mess from her getting sick (she's a sensitive cat). When they finally did take her in, the doctor was thorough with questioning, but charged us $105 & sent us home with a mild anticonvulsant & nerve pain medication... Just so we could take her back the next day.

I was never told that in order to collect a sample they would have to put a needle stuck into her belly, she's had tests done before, but her previous doctor was always so informative beforehand; I would have gladly let them know that she is not a friendly cat & is easily stressed, I assumed more questions would be taken before the check up or that they were just the kind of office that could tackle any issue. After confirming for us that her signs of UTI may be related to a stress condition (which I was simply hoping to receive a confirmation of & medication for), it was decided to simply give her an anticonvulsant & nerve pain Medication (& charge us for it & the visit), then wait until the next day & SEE if anesthesia would be necessary? So you can charge us again for another visit, probably a premium for anesthesia, maybe even some fee for holding her (I wouldn't have been shocked) all to possibly exacerbate what is LIKELY a stress condition?

I don't know why I went along with this! It took until this morning when my cat threw up the medication for me to realize... Professionals do not automatically warrant trust, especially when due diligence isn't applied. I'm not taking my poor, stressed out furbaby to a clinic that didn't even bother to ask me normal questions about a new patient. Just make a questionnaire to add to the paperwork or ask questions over the phone so a plan of action can be made. Why would you want to waste the time & money of your clients & further stress out a patient that cannot communicate? It's ridiculous.<//Text>< rate>

<rating>1</rating><review>If I could give them zero stars I would.  Took my dog the same day he had been at the pet ER PETS Hospital for having a cluster of seizures.  The vet at the er prescribed him anti-seizure medication to be taken everyday and not to stop. When he was seen later that day at Evergreen, they did a full blood work and told me to stop it after five days and see how he did. Also got a call from another of their vets a few days later, letting me know I could stop the seizure medication after five days. My dog had a severe seizure Two weeks after I had stopped the medication. I Had to take him to emergency at PETS Hospital and he did not recover and died the following day. The vet at PETS Hospital said he should of never stopped taking the anti-seizure medication. I emailed Evergreen and let them know what happened and asked to have a copy of the blood work that was done which one of their vets had said everything was normal. After Getting the report I noticed that it was not all normal and he had three things that were high and one that was low and these were things that had to do with his kidney function and white blood cell count. I didn’t even get a “sorry for your loss” in the vets email back to me. Not a word said in her email. Just a copy of the blood work.  RIP my little Figgy💔   Evergreen Animal Clinic was different in the 80’s and 90’s. Back then it was owned by a different vet that was fair priced and honest.  The new owners, that vet that posted the follow up and his wife both portray to care but the feeling we got was that its just a fancy vet that charges a lot and everyone is just another customer.  In that email that we got with his lab results which, by the way, showed things that where not normal and you guys never mentioned to us, we never got a sorry or anything showing that you cared. It was not  until You saw the negative review on here, when you decided to contact us.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeEXezjQurZkmRIN7BEmU5IUYiMd2Wu3_Op3Uk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>Dr Drazsnzak was very helpful.  He spent a long time talking with me regarding several concerns I had regarding my dogs.  He gave me tips on how to treat some of the conditions at home.  He also followed up with me the next day to see how they both were doing.  I can tell he truly cares for animals and does a great job as a veterinarian.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Hannah H.< /user_name><time>1580153770125</time><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Vets are friendly and very responsive, however they are very overpriced. For a visit alone it is $65. Got charged $22 for deworming medication that once I got home and looked it up on Chewy it cost only $5 for the same exact thing. Same brand and dosage of what they charged me the $22 for. Over 400% mark up. Have paid this vet office over the last month around $200 trying to figure out this issue. I do understand that it can be difficult to catch, because tapeworms are small and hard to identify,  however, I do think that this vet location prioritizes profit as they are quick to recommend very pricy tests. Stool sample was not recommend after the visit a couple of weeks ago, but extremely costly blood tests and x-rays were, as well as water injections and appetite stimulating pills for the symptoms. Clinic is very clean, rooms are spacious, and I appreciated that I was able to be seen quickly when needed.<//text></record></dataset><record>

We take our Pomi, Arty, to Dr. Scheel. She is patient, kind, and very caring. Also gives us the time we need for questions and concerns to be answered. The office staff is so nice. The waiting and examining rooms are always clean. We can't even imaging going anywhere else, and we drive almost 25 minutes to get to the clinic. Absolutely worth it.👍<//Text>

The best way to know if you are going to like and trust a business is the first contact you have with them. I can say that from the first time I contacted evergreen green animal clinic I received a warm welcome. I felt like part of the family and didn’t worry about how well they would treat my puppy. I’ve had a few surprises pop up over the past year and they have been there to reassure me and make sure that my little guy is well taken care of. I would definitely not hesitate recxome ding to friends and family.<//review>

< review>
Seemed to be knowledgeable and gave me some good advice for our baby kitty. However none of the staff were very personable. None of them smiled very often, atmosphere seemed so tense and impatient. My cat doesnt like new places and strangers. She got upset of course, no issue for me to handle, however the vet and helper both got super scared of her. Understandable, however animals sense ypur atmosphere as well so that didnt help any. The vet was very monotone and only cracked a tiny smile once i think. Caught the feeling that she didnt really care to be working. I understand that they are professionals but when i offered my help in immobilising my cat to conduct the rest of her routine check up, they denied my help and continued to struggle. Professionals or not, i know how my cat is and how to treat her when she is upset, YOU DO NOT because you arent with her all the time and dont know her personality. Maybe try to listen to your patients owners more often. May do some good. Overall, not a good visit and will not be going back as they still charger me FULL price for a checkup that they barely even got started conducting as they were too scared to continue, that's disgusting. After seeing my review the insisted on calling me, hung up when I realized who i was talking to. Then they called again, I ignored, then they texted me and called my wife! So lets add harrasment after the scam this morning. S.m.h. you should be ashamed of yourselves.< /review>

This is an exceptional family business with caring, compassionate Dr.’s. I explicitly trust them with our dog, Mop. They are thorough without over treating   I would, without hesitation, recommend this practice for your pet.< /Text>

Unpleasant experience for my injured pet. Vet spoke down to me about controlling "my animal" she called him. But his name is Max. When ahead and made a new appointment without asking me if that is a good time for me, then walked out of the room without even letting me respond. Never greeted my scared injured pet. No treats to make they seem as friends. I walked out and took my pet to a safer and more friendly pet hospital in orcutt. I was 10 mins late. So sorry my bad.</review>

<text>My dog had a foxtail in her ear. There was no doubt. I was at their door when they opened. That's when I was told they open at 8, but a vet is not present until 840. That was disconcerting. If an animal clinic opens at 8, shouldn't it be staffed to care for animals?
If you go to a market when it opens, is it ok that the meat department doesn't open until an hour later?? No.
But after a wait of 45 minutes, the vet did see my dog and promptly removed the fox tail. For that, I do thank them.
Prices are reasonable.< /text>< gmapID>

That is no excuse, and I am sorry that you had to wait. Your time is valuable and if we tell you we can see you at 8:00 and you then have to wait 45 minutes that is very frustrating. We will strive harder to let our clients know what time the doctor can see them so that they do not have to wait so long. Again, I'm sorry you had to wait and I hope that on your next visit we are more prompt.\n\nJacques Drazsnzak, DVM\nOwner, Evergreen Animal Clinic"}</response>

<review>I gave Evergreen Animal Clinic 5 stars because I was impressed with my overall experience. Anyone seeking advice on their pet should take their animal to see Dr. Drazsnzak and his staff. All were very professional and knowledgeable. I have a French Bulldog that was having some reactions to a particular food and was causing some stomach issues. With their help and their knowledge they were able to suggest a couple brands to try and after a wk or so I noticed a huge difference. So from Stella and I we thank you! Take your pets to this clinic! They’ll forever be grateful. Danke Schön!</review>< Pics>

<text>I have entrusted all of my cats' care and maintenance to the veterinarians at Evergreen Animal Clinic for years! The professionalism, expertise, and compassionate care the veterinarians have demonstrated - especially Drs. Magee and Drazsnzak -  are unsurpassed.

They have always made the experience pleasant, safe and informative,  and have provided the best care I could hope for. When the time came to euthanize one of my beloved feline companion Shakti, they went the extra distance to perform it in the most compassionate and stress-free manner, for which I will always be grateful.</text>< GmapID>

<review>The veterinarians at Evergreen are super! They cared for our two cats for most of their 17 years, keeping them healthy throughout their lives. Big Miri had severe arthritis of the hip, could barely walk, and just when we thought her condition was hopeless, Dr. Drazsnzak found a medication that clearly added a few years of mobility for her. I am still amazed that after her first injection of the medication, she came home and dashed across the room. We were amazed since she had struggled to walk before this.

Miri's sidekick, Boomer, was kept healthy by Dr. Magee's excellent care for all of his life. When he became ill with terminal cancer, it nearly devastated my husband since they had been companions day and night for all of Boomer's life. Had it not been for the compassionate care from Dr. Magee, I don't think my husband could have handled Boomer's eventual end. She was so patient and understanding and explained everything in detail to us, outlining all of our options. Her knowledge of veterinary medicine and willingness to take time to explain everything are exceptional.

We now have two new kittens, and they are getting their care at Evergreen, too. I give this clinic, with their great doctors and staff, the highest of ratings for their incredible knowledge of veterinary medicine, thoroughness during visits, excellent follow-up after appointments, and their genuine concern for our pets.<//review>< pictures>

Amazing lunch specials here. Like San Tung level good. Pictured here, the hunan fish. The black bean fish is even better.< /review>

Visiting Chicago and tried to give this place a try. It was our favorite food all weekend! We even considered it superior to a James Beard nominated restaurant! Our server, Alicia, was fabulous and the food was warm and delicious. Our particular favorites were the Chinese pickles and miso soup. Yummy interpretations of some of our favorite classics. Would return and recommend! Cute interiors too :-)</review>

<review>Fast and tasty, without the oilliness of some other Chinese restaurant's dishes. Walnut prawns with a minimal amount of mayonnaise, lemon prawns was the right balance of tart and sweet, and beef vegetable chow mein had slightly al dente noodles - all very satisfying.< /review><time>1526528208126<//time></record></dataset><record>

We had the garlic eggplant appetizer and I can't wait to go back for more!  They made their Chow Fun vegan for me even though usually it has all the meat, and I loved it, too.< /Review></record>

<Review>Authentic Chinese food. There was no line. Staff is pleasant. The chow fun was my favorite dish of the day (we also ordered honey walnut shrimp, potstickers, garlic chicken, sweet and sour pork, and some other items) - no complaints about anything. During certain hours, the sunlight pouring through their windows will blast you in the eyes.< /Review></record>

< review>
Food is better than most Chinese restaurants but service lacks. Their attitude always puts me off. Sometimes I order food at 9:20, they say it'll be ready at 9:30 and when I get there the kitchen is dark and closed, which gives me cause for concern how my food was actually made... They're also obsessed with closing at 9:30 so don't you dare come in at 9:31 for that take-out or expect an earful.  If their staff expects to be out the door at 9:30, they should consider closing at 9 instead, it's really not the customer's problem.</review>

Alice’s is my favorite Chinese restaurant for at least 18 years. My favorite dish there is their walnut prawn. It’s the best walnut prawn I’ve ever had anywhere. Their orange chicken is great too.< /text>

I was in town from Portland on business and didn't really want to deal with city traffic. I found this place on Yelp and wasn't disappointed. The duck was nothing shy of amazing and the service was impeccable. This will be a mandatory stop for me every time I come into town.< /text>

One of my all time favorite places to grab pick up in Noe Valley.
Everything on the menu is good but I love;
Walnut Prawns, Star Chicken, Crab Rangoon's, Orange Beef.

They are very fast, service is always top notch, also great for lunch.< /review>

I would give this a 4 1/2 stars except for the rudeness of the person taking our orders and giving us the food when we came to pick it up .  The food itself seems high quality and well thought out. Too bad I had to deal with this same person and I'm thinking that if I'm not treated as a valued customer next time , it will be the last time I eat Alice's food. I can always eat at or p/u at Eliza's on California Street , the menu is almost identical.<//text>

The food seems average but had a weird experience today. I parked by the side of restaurant snd they drove up in a van. It was a tight spot abd they kept banging imto the back if my car as they unloaded. Most of the stufg was in cardboard boxes but there was a metal frame that took a little paint off my trunk. The guy denied it happened but when he banged into the car i could feel it move so that was a lie. I am done with Alice's restaurant now</text>

<review>This place was great at one time.  My last 2 visits the food has been very bla.  Potstickers lukewarm.  Obviously pre cooked.  The curry prawns were terrible.  I see why there was plenty of mty tables at 7pm...Im done after many years eating here...oh well<//review>< Pictures>

<review>It’s 4:30 AM can’t reach any staff. I have not seen not one ranger. All night long loud people drinking and yelling. Came here camping with my family, no sleep. This may be by far the worst camping trip. The location is beautiful great sites, just unbelievably NOT family friendly. They staff has totally failed 100%.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Loafer Creek Campground lies at the east side of the lake, and the campground reflects the best of the foothills in winter: the black, naked arms of the oaks, covered with moss; the shiny green leaves of the branching live oak trees; last year’s grasses now sun-bleached husks beaten down and returning to the earth; bright green winter grasses, short and thick, where the sun shines most; and finally the gray and black boulders scattered by long-ago volcanic eruptions, their scaled, sharp shoulders covered by gray lichen and green moss. Above was the gray of low cloud cover and fog, occasionally the sun burning through, beams of light and blue sky.

I began my 14-mile bicycle trek in the valley, which has an altitude of about 600 feet in the valley around the Oroville area. Highway 162 begins its climb quickly, and I enjoyed the challenge of the hills and mountains up until just past the Wagon Wheel Market, where I stopped and pushed for a while, resting my climbing muscles. I actually enjoy walking a bit if the way is not too steep or the bicycle not too heavily packed. It’s an even simpler version of bike touring except the even slower pace allows for even closer inspection and appreciation of the surroundings--a tiny dark blue flower with a yellow center is one treasure I spied while pushing my bike. The first steady ride was about two thirds of my journey; the last third was an alternation of riding and pushing.

I set up camp, bought a bundle of firewood and borrowed a hatchet, cooked some lunch, and explored a bit. It was beautiful, silent and open. I sat upon a pale yellow-red sedimentary rock and just soaked up the silence of the sky, the green mountain summits, and the blue water of the lake. My leg muscles were tired from the trip up the mountain, and I knew I’d feel my toil when I had to head back up the hill to the campground. It was worth it, though. Maybe twenty minutes by car would have brought me to the lake, but my interaction with the foothills, with the sugar pines and the scrub oaks and the manzanita would have been minimal. Some of the manzanita were flowering, their pink bulb-like flowers massed in a carpet beside the road. The green winter grasses were dew-speckled and gleamed like jewels when the sun broke through the fog.

A fire, tea and breakfast, and breaking camp and packing took up the early morning. The trip home, of course, was much quicker since it was downhill. I still had to walk a couple of sections, most notably the hill up past The Oaks, a long stretch of road straight up the hill. Also on the second day of an overnighter, I always notice the lower level of my stamina from the first day. That’s my main beef with overnighters, not enough time and mileage to really get in shape. I was patient with myself, though, and coasted (mostly) off the mountain and down into the valley fog. With my tail- and headlights blinking, I cruised into my brother’s mobile home park.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVRGcczYVKAtiGlNxNec32nt4Cj7MwH1peDq4m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvdeArUXvuWVHuq_4kiUxcZvfqc6zYWpe-8SAx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

Restrooms and showers clean. Plenty of shade. Even though it's 100° during the day, the night air feels nice. Picnic benches have too many Huge Black spiders and spider eggs that are the size of cheeseballs and when clustered together, they are the size of a golf ball. Pretty scary. No wonder at night, I don't even hear the sound of crickets. The patrol are informative and come around to say hi and are friendly and give glowsticks to the children. The Lake nearby is very low. Looks like in a quarry of layered rocks. Very difficult to dock the boat and find a spot nearby to picnic and no shade because the water level was extremely low.</Review>

Nice place but the beach needs attending to. Adding sand to the beach or generally improving the beach line seems like common sense considering the water is the main attraction. Instead it is usually full of rocks and weeds.</review>

<Time>1562084722244</Time><rating>4</rating><text>We just spent a great weekend here. I do suggest bug spray, the mosquitoes come out at dusk and can be irritating. Other than that, we had no problems with bugs. THE SHOWERS TAKE TOKENS, I didn't see that on any of the other info I read before going. When we were there the token machine wasn't functioning...so no showers for the weekend. The day use/swimming area was lovely. Lots of trees, green grass (even in the summertime), restrooms, a roped off swim area, and lifeguards. The park is well maintained and reasonably clean.  We are already planning our next trip here.</text>< pics>

<review>I haven't made it to the horse camp yet, because I can't find a map of the trails. One website reported 40 miles of trails. I saw one post about a 4.7 mile loop, but that is hardly worth it for me to drive 2 hours to ride a trail for an hour. Please post a detailed map of the trails accessible from Loafer Creek Horse Camp.< /review>< Name>

<Text>Our stay here for a week was kind of up and down. Bad first impression with the check-in as we arrived to a practically empty campground without a reservation. We unhooked our class A motorhome and tow-behind Jeep just before getting to the check-in gate so we could better navigate the campground road and get into a site. The park worker wouldn’t believe that this was a tow vehicle and charged us an extra $7 for an “extra vehicle” that wasn’t extra. Then she wouldn’t let us book a site in-person for more than 1 day. We had to go online to book any more nights, which was bizarre and a way to get an extra online reservation fee. All nickel-and-diming for money here. Dogs are allowed practically nowhere here, which is a larger issue with CA state parks. Then this campground turned into a crime scene when a suicidal camper in a tent/tarp setup tried to light a car on fire. Rangers with big guns were patrolling, but they were nice and kept us updated. The park was also doing a controlled burn but didn’t restrict campfires or advise campers of the burn in advance. Smoky and could see flames in the distance at night. All of this made me feel less than safe camping here. Boat ramp and almost all trails closed for the week, so we couldn’t do much here, which was disappointing. BUT the sites are spacious and separated from neighbors, the bathrooms are clean, and it’s peaceful as long as there are no criminals as your neighbors. Camping in CA is expensive so this is an affordable option if you don’t need hookups and can deal with some uncertainty and disappointments.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<rating>3</rating><review>It has great loation, clean camp grounds. Ok for RV, tent. Or even car camping. Also has it's own boat launch ramp, beach with upper grass level hosting BBQ pits, picnic tablets shade, sun, grass or beach areas which lends appeal to many campers, overnighters, daytime warriors, group gatherings etc. Besides, it is one of the best lakes in California. However, I have exprienced very poor business practices, operations, as well as some of the worst customer I have ever experienced.< /review>< Pics>

<username>Suzanna Workman<//username><Rating>2</Rating><text>Well, if course,  I tried to call before a visit.  The phone was busy everytime I called.
I goggled the directions and drove over. No indication that it was a business.  No office. No signs. No parking lot, mostly a turnaround spot as it is at the end of Blue Cloud road.
So, I walked my dog down the dirt road about 100 ft to some penned animals, emus, llamas, a donkey. They were sweet but guarded. The donkey actually opened a gate and walked into a paved, human area. He looked like he might be a handful.
Other than that the place was deserted. I felt like I might be at Cesar's house or something,  so I left. As I was leaving, a woman in a golf cart drove into the turnaround and approached me. She quietly indicated that I was on private property. I said I knew that and was leaving.
So, I wish I could say more as I am a huge fan. The website lead me to believe it was a business. Otherwise, I would not have gone there.</text><Response>None< /Response><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

I have never visited Cesar Millan's Dog Psychology Center, but it is my dream to visit one day. He is a blessing, and I have a Rotti (his heart's desire) that I know could benefit from his assistance--the trainer died in middle of teaching and Sasha is mean!!

Anyway, THANK YOU Cesar (and family) for all you do! You absolutely help me in my profession as a Social Worker.<//text>

I’ve been following Cesar since 2011 he is the best as far as I’m concerned. I bought his online subscription and I learned a lot about caring for my dog.<//Review>

<user_name>Joe Traveler<//user_name><text>Cesar is a special breed on his own. His concept regarding energy is 100% correct. His logic is simple and works becausr it's about understanding how dogs think and react compared to a human worl where often dogs are treated like humans.

The negative reviews seem to focus on high cost but when you want the best it carriesa cost. Cesar can not be expected to do everything for nothing. Give the man a break, I'm sure he has a very busy schedule and more work than he can handle.

There will always be jealous people who will attack people because they wish they had his talent and touch. Cesar has paid his dues coming to the US illegally with almost nothing and working hard to where he is. He's only human bit you can tell connects with people with good energy. Give him a break, fame can be hard on people and relationships.<//text>< rating>

Like everything , there are advantages and dis-advantages ..

Besides of i  totally agree  with the 1st. comment of J R. I would add the following :

The technical  material , the course and the final result .

The Material are very good, I liked it, Cesar himself has the talent for sure, and he is able to give you the right answer,  He answers all questions.

The walk with him was very limited ( Short in time) , would have been much better making the course with much less number of people ( was about 25 students or more )  ..  With more focus  ,  small round tables for small groups..  the investment I paid was not little, worth more time for each student  ..

After the course i was able to better understand  and interact with my Dog. that is for my case.

They did a great effort for hospitality, Support was given by the trainers in logistics and arranging  me a Dog  ( i was coming all the way from Cairo, Egypt ).

Thanks,<//text>

<resp>None< /resp><rate>2< /rate><Review>Not so sure I want to be his fan anymore. Seems like his family turned him into quite the opposite of friendly. I to be honest think famous people suck. They just think they are better than everyone else. I have trained many dogs basic obedience and beyond training and have had no Pryor experience at all its just a gift that comes with the territory of being AWESOMELY AUTISTIC. it's just basic common sense really.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< UserId.>

I appreciate the staff, the accommodations are awesome, and my relationship with my dogs went to a whole other level. Very happy client!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Hi all.
Can I be allowed to translate and publish the letters I receive from you (as cesar M. has written)?
I hope I can come to Helsingborg in 2018 and experience him alive.
Sincerely, thanks, because CM has given me a quieter and harmonious life.

Pros and Cons of the Cesar's Way Fundamentals Class:
Pros: it's a super fun and entertaining class, you get a free leash and a free bag

Cons: -It's no longer taught by Brian Agnew and Cheri Lucas unfortunately.
-the class is huuuuge with over 30 people and 30 dogs. it costs $6000 which is insanely high.
-You only get to meet Cesar on the morning pack walk for about 3 minutes and he seems like he would rather be sleeping than walking with you and talking to you about your dog.
-there are so many dogs in the class that your dog might not get picked for any demonstrations or activities
-almost all dogs are so well behaved that they really don't need any corrections. (I was expecting red-zone dogs that you can really learn from)
-all your trainer conversations are with 6 to 8 different trainers (some paid some volunteers) who have totally different answers to the same question, leaving you more confused than ever
-if you watch every single episode of the Dog Whisperer, you will get the same information that's presented in the class.
-the whole experience feels very 'cult"-ish
In summary; if you are a person with limited finances, I think you are better off paying $6000 to either Cheri or Brian to rehabilitate you and your dog. Your dog will appreciate it more. If you have $6000 to blow on entertainment, take the classes</review>

Hello mr. MILAN

this is Amit from INDIA..one day i suddenly came across your youtubr videos and i was just awestruck at watching the way mr. Milan controls the dog behaviour...bunch of wishes to this gentleman for the task he does.

Coming to the point . I have a 5 month old male lab puppy..he is a very playful one but tha problm that i face with him is that as i open the main door he just rushes through it. How to control this behaviour of his??
And second is , he is quite lethargic while having his food...he takes around 3 4 hr to complete his meal..any solution fr dis??

Warm regards sir
Amit dey.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I was lucky to be able to visit this place and I have to say that I found it incredible. They are all very friendly! We did not have the pleasure of meeting César, which I would have loved but it was still an unforgettable experience. Congratulations on all your work! You are magnificent.

My wife and I decided to go somewhere a little different for lunch yesterday. We were surprised that there was not a line of cars going down Harbor for Cane's as we normally see. With that we probably did a U-turn! There was a fairly short drive-through line that was divided into two separate lines and merged. That strategy went fairly well for us to pick up our lunch. Returning home, our food was still piping hot and delicious!  Not a big fan of sweet tea in general but this was terrific!  To offer one thing critical, I wish the french fries would've been a little bit crisper; however, overall it was truly yummy!  Well done!< /review>

Their in-house thousand island is the best I've ever had! Word of advice, the four piece is just enough to fill someone up, for the great price of just $9 per order! But if you like a little more for later, or just eat a bit more than your average person then absolutely recommend the six piece 😊</review>

Chicken fingers and Texas toast are consistently good in different locations. The fries given are a small portion and I'm not a huge fan of their crinkle cut fries. To me, McDonald's fries are better. Their dining room is open again, but ketchup dispenser is broken and their ice machine can't keep up with customers. I don't understand the cult like following Cane's has. Their food is good, not great. In N Out deserves their cult like following, these guys not so much.<//review>

Drive thru had a long line (must be good food) but it moved fast.   3 piece combo was a perfect meal for those in the need of some great fried chicken tenders.  Definitely recommend this chicken joint.< /Review>

Juice and tender chicken finger, fast drive through. But is not my favorite chicken place. Very small selection of chicken, only one taste. If there is more favor to it it will be better choice for more selection.<//Text>

Good place but my sugar went from 140 to 440 after using the signature sauce. I'm a type 1 diabetic but that is one hell of an increase, granted I only used 1 sauce packet but I took a shot (to regulate my insulin before the meal).<//Review>

Best chicken fingers ever. The soda is also great - always fizzy and ice cold.< /review>

It was OK so I'll give it three stars.  But I could have gotten the same thing out of a frozen bag of chicken from Costco.... Way cheaper too! The previously frozen crinkle cut fries were all good.<//review>

My 6 year old says it's the "only place in Costa Mesa to get chicken". Who am I to argue?<//Review>

Been here a lot since it opened. They rarely mess up my order but this time was bad. Ordered a caniac combo and a box combo with 2 extra sauce. I received 2 3 finger combos with 1 extra sauce. I called to complain and they thought I was lying and wanted me to bring the food back with the receipt. By that time I was 20 minutes away at my house with minimal fries because well who doesn’t eat fries in the car. I asked them if they would credit me with a code or something and they said they would only do it if I came back so I hungup. $7 down the drain in items I wasn’t given. Customer service needs to improve. Disappointed</Text>

I'm actually helping to build them here in California-Juicy bites of Chicken Fingers- the Sauce has a flavor of its own.

Simple food,  great price and resturants.

If I was for the food only they would get a five star rating but due to the fact that at lunch time no one was outside taking orders or helping direct the close to twenty cars in line. I probably was in line 15 minutes before anyone came to help the front cars. The exit is an accident waiting to happen when the line is on harbor. There is not enough room to come and go if the cars don't work together.<//text>

This place changed my life. I had never truly experienced amazing fast chicken until I accidentally went here 30 years later.

Somehow just as packed as In-N-Out, if not more, and gets the food out way faster. I rarely wait more than 5 minutes for my food after ordering, meanwhile every seat in the place is filled. I leave this place happier than when I got there every time.

Also, Texas Toast is the side I never knew I needed with my fast food. Remember to swap the buns on the sandwich with the toast!</review>

The thousand island dressing is kinda like In and Out. THE CHICKEN IS KILLER! it is kinda like Chick filet but just tad more grease but a ton more crunch. I can't belive I waited this long to eat here.  Oh and the drive thru in Costa Mesa, CA you can fit a small trailer thru I was moving at the time of going here.

I thought the portions could've been a bit bigger today like I've experienced in the past. Didn't get that much sauce. However, the texture is crispy and rich for chicken, a staple for cains to exemplify. I think it did it here really well as that's always very consistent.</Text>

Absolutely the best fast food style chicken you could ask for. Whole, white meat tenders cooked to perfection. Coated in a brilliant, crispy fried batter, with moist delicious chicken in each bite. They only do chicken tenders, Cole slaw, fries and Texas toast, with their infamous Canes Sauce, which results in an incredibly consistent meal every single time.<//Text>

When you only do one thing, you had better do it right. These chicken strips are really really good. The breading is perfectly seasoned, and the dipping sauce is right on target.< /Review>

Raising Cane's is the place to go if you want big pieces of juicy, moist, crispy chicken tenders with fries, cole slaw, Texas toast, and a sweet tea all in one sitting. I just had it for dinner earlier and my mouth is current salivating thinking about the meal lol.

Since this location opened, I've only had it twice (I usually get it in Vegas) and tonight reminded me why I love Raising Cane's in the first place.

Chicken tenders: nothing disappoints me more than ordering chicken tenders and it comes out soggy, oily, and has more batter than chicken. Here, the tenders are moist and crispy. Trust me, you'll want to keep eating even though your tenders are piping hot - I was impatient and nearly burned my tongue with the first bite.

Cane's sauce: can't figure out what's in it but it's creamy and tangy. Kind of reminds me of sriracha garlic aioli. Mmmm so good. Your chicken tenders and fries are incomplete without this!

Texas toast: toasty, buttery, hint of garlic. I love carbs so no doubt I love the toast.

I normally get cole slaw as well but since I shared my meal tonight with my SO, I asked to sub it for more fries and it was the perfect amount to share.< /text>

It’s chicken tenders. Decently juicy, but still not a game changer that everyone made it out to be.

I always get the Caniac combo, since it never seems to let me down and that the sandwich is just chicken tenders shoved in between bread. Someday I’ll give it a chance! The tenders are always juicy (as they should be from a chicken joint), and the toast has an incredible crust with still enough give to have a fluffy texture. That being said, there’s no real highlight here unless you add in the sauce. The food is well executed, but is only seasoned with salt or that I could only really notice salt. The coleslaw is rather run of the mill, rich and a bit much. Writing about it now though, I’d like to slather that on the sandwich… Going back, the food isn’t bad by all means, but again shelling out 10+ for a meal for the cheapest cut of protein and starch is a bit much. It also feels like every trip I make, the tenders get smaller and I occasionally get an oily soggy tender.

This is a late night hot spot from what I’ve noticed, expect seating to get tight unless you’re here for lunch. Cleanliness is about there though, and the booth/corner seats are suited for larger groups!

I like the food here, but it’s not amazing. It’s just fried foods done decent.</Review>

Not a fan of their coleslaw so I always substitute it for an extra toast. If the line is long, park and go inside! You can be in and out by the they take care of 4 cars. That's not to say their drive thru service is slow. People ordering and paying are just a little slow and going inside usually has 2 cashiers waiting with no line. Also, enter and exit through the carmax side instead of trying to deal with the busy main street.< /review>

True this place is hard to get trough and has long drive-thru lines as well but it’s because their chicken strips are pretty darn good. They claim their strips are never frozen and you can taste the difference.

We got the Box Combo that comes with four strips, fries, coleslaw and a drink for about $8. The iced teas have the right amount of sweetness and welcoming on a hot day.< /Review>

I'm actually helping to build them here in California-Juicy bites of Chicken Fingers- the Sauce has a flavor of its own.

Simple food,  great price and resturants.

<Review>The first time you go may not impress you, but wait! A few weeks later you will be craving more out of the blue and you will keep coming back for more. Some locations are better then others and specific times of the day the chicken is fresher. You have to go to find out. Great deal for the price!<//Review>< rating>

Unbelievable boneless "fried chicken".  I have never had anything like this before.  I am not a fried chicken person, but it is fresh and delicious fast food.  Always busy, but employees are sharp and on top of their game.  Have been several times and will definitely go back.  Crunchy and light...and comes with tons of fries and a "Texas Toast".  Coleslaw is yummy side, too.  It's a fish and chips with chicken!  DELICIOUS!!!!  🤗< /review>

Love this place so much. Has amazing chicken, and their special sauce is delicious and extremely unique. I didn't understand what the big deal was until I went for the first time. Now, I am definitely a regular. The only negative is that there are a lot of people and it is loud. But that makes the place seem fun and enjoyable. Besides, to me, that also means people love the place enough to want to keep on coming. Service is good and everyone working there treats you well and respectfully. Super happy with this place.</text>

This place is so good. Signature cane sauce ftw. Fluffy, crispy, and warm bread. The fried chicken is crunchy in a way that you dont risk hurting your teeth while eating it, I feel like.</review>

<username>Chandler Unlimited< /username><Time>1581815481698</Time><rating>4< /rating><review>Cane's it is... my son talked me into coming here, not a go to choice, but was willing to give it shot. Overall, it's definitely the hangout spot for the teens. Not my preference to dine in, but seems more like an after the game, let's grab some food, spot.

As for the menu, well, it's either chicken, chicken, or chicken; chicken fingers or a chicken finger sandwiche. I chose "the box" 4 fingers, slaw, and Texas toast. Food was pretty good, not great and not bad.

Between the long drive through, cramped parking lot, and the hustle and bustle it's completely not a spot I'd look forward to visiting on a regular. But, would say this is for the high school and college kids to take part in and enjoy.

Rating wise, I'd give the food: 7 out of 10, customer service 9 out of 10, cleanliness 8.5 out of 10, speed of order 8 out of 10, convenience with drive thru and line inside 6.5 out 10.</review>< Pics>

I love canes. I tried giving security a tip for his work and would not accept due to canes rules. They need to set an app where we can tip your workers. Came in sat June 6th<//review>

A little pricey for chicken fingers that you can pretty much get anywhere. And they don't have ranch dressing... Who eats chicken fingers without ranch dressing bring your own if you need it! Their house sauces okay but they charge for any extra. But apparently if you're in high school this is the place to be because it's always packed with high school kids just sitting around taking up tables</review></record>

< Review>
Chicken was very juicy and crispy but there was no flavor on the chicken itself. You have to depend on the sauce which I did not like as much as some others who have raved about it  the cole slaw tasted very fresh but again, no flavor. The Texas toast was good and fluffy. The fries are crinkle cut with no salt, which I like, but I like most fries with no salt.</Review>

<text>First, I would like to say this place is different then any other chicken place I tried. This is actually my first time trying out there menu. I picked the box combo and in it was 4 pieces of chicken a pound of fries, coleslaw and a biscuit. The one  that stood out to me was there chicken the outside of it was the crispy texture,  the meat was soft and white like any chicken should be. I took a bite of the chicken it was actually delicious because the taste was different but in a good way. Everything else beside the chicken was good. I'm definitely coming back here to try the their chicken again. I would recommend this to people who haven't tried their chicken.</text>< Pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Delicious food! Chicken is so moist and breaded lightly. You can tell it's real breast and not processed. We were so surprised as to how juicy the chicken tenders were! They need to Ikea up a spot in Burbank! Love their coleslaw and crinkle cut fries, too! Please open one up closer to us! I promise you will see a line out the door!< /text>< Pictures>

Stuffed myself, then passed out into a minor food coma for a couple hours in parking lot.  Surprisingly safe lot with very little parking though.   Super busy. They should put a tad more salt in recipe, that's the only thing missing.  Still 5 stars.<//text>

The sandwich consists of 3 chicken strips instead of a single piece. One strip kept falling out until I figured out how to hold the sandwich The strips were tender with a  crunchy battered crust. Fries are crinkled cut. The line was long but the wait was short. I would eat here again whenever I am in the area.

It's chicken. Fried chicken strips that are typical fast food flavored. Not sure what all the hype is when I can get chicken strips like this from most any fastfood restaurant. Overall, not a fan.< /text>

Always great! There's only one "complaint" and I don't even want to call it a complaint, but the place is always packed. Usually a pretty long line anytime they're open. But, worth the wait for sure.
It reminds me of In N Out but instead of burgers - it's Chicken. Similar in the sense that it's a small menu but everything is incredible & they've both always got a lonnng line to wait in.
Again - It's still definitely worth the wait!<//Review>

The dine in is closed right now, so the drive through is crazy busy, but they're handling it really well. It didn't take Nearly as long as I expected to get my order, which was a relief, since the double line was really long!</Text>

Admittedly I'm not much of chicken finger fan but IMO these are OK and the signature sauce is nothing to write about....I did like the Texas toast. That was the best part of the meal.</Text>

This location was the first one I discovered and has a reliable bike rack where I can confidently secure my bike while eating here.< /Review><date>1580520881635<//date>< name>

<text>The fried chicken is really great, just the right amount of juiciness inside and crunch on the outside so it doesn't hurt your soft palate. Their sauce is just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess so it doesn't overwhelm the great flavors coming from the chicken. Customer service is always great! Restrooms are really clean too.

All the hoopla about Popeye's and Chick Fil A, well if you're in Orange County, try Raising Cane. Smells from the parking lot guide you to the register. It was my virgin run, but the food was very good. It was hot and fresh. Staff was friendly and engaged. The dining area was clean and not crowded, but the ambiance was good. Sorry did not see the rest room though. Plenty of parking
Overall, it was a good look. Only gripe I got was traffic, but the 405 was literally a stone's throw away, so no biggie.< /review>

<Text>This one is EXTREMELY busy all the time. With that said, they still get my order right EVERY TIME! and the food is fresh. If you are looking for a quiet sit down, this isn't the place for you. If you're young and like a crowd, enjoy the atmosphere!< /Text>< pics>

Best place to get some food when in a hurry. Their customer service is fast, rates are fair, good mood. I highly recommend this spot.</Text>

Admittedly I'm not much of chicken finger fan but IMO these are OK and the signature sauce is nothing to write about....I did like the Texas toast. That was the best part of the meal.</Review>

<Review>Not your typical chicken joint. This place has a uniquely interesting backstory and serves Texas toast with their chicken meals. This location was the first one I discovered and has a reliable bike rack where I can confidently secure my bike while eating here.<//Review>< Pics>

I ordered today, and when i saw my order was COMPLETELY incorrect (only 3 of the 4 cups had drinks and 1 cup was full of ice and they never did any of my substitutions) i gave them a call just to find that they refuse to accept ANY responsibility!!!! THERE WAS A HAIR IN MY CUP!!!! .....DURING COVID-19!!! Im sure the HEALTH DEPARTMENT would LOOOOVE to hear about this! They refused to fix anything and denied any culpability in the dirtiness and innacuracy on their end!

Very good value. Enjoyed it. 4 finger combo almost too much. The fries are like something out of a 1970's TV dinner, but the coleslaw and Texas Toast made up for it.<//Text>

The food is ok kind of a bland chicken Their sauce is what gives it any flavor and be prepared to pay for it. Fifty cents for a small dipping cup. You get one cup with the 2 piece meal, one with the 3 piece meal, 1 with the 4 piece meal and you don't get a second sauce till you get a larger than 4 piece meal. They are decent sized pieces of chicken and they're not afraid to charge you for it but it is bland and needs the sauce. The coleslaw is ok. My fries were not nearly as hot as the chicken but they are really busy and I think they are made in  abundance to cover all the meals. The parking is horrible and the drive thru takes forever. Good to try but nothing special for the price.<//text>

The sauce is RAD and tho the fries are rather thin cut, I think the pricing is right there, and the portions are relative. I believe we can always find a better way to meet public demand but for the most part we got a WINNER folks!!</Review>< gmap_id>

Nothing special.

I suppose there was too much hype leading up to my first visit.

Chicken was good but nothing to write home about. The breading didn't seem to stick to the chicken entirely so not sure if we had a genuine representation. Fries were definitely good, hot and crispy. Texas toast seemed fresh but not very Texas E. I might come back but certainly not if it's packed like I've seen it.<//Text><user_name>ap dricker</user_name>< Resp>

Honestly it has been the best chicken ive tasted around...nothing compares to it. And if i loved the chicken i super duper loved the Bread and the fries are amazing...not too dry not too salty it was the perfect. It was like buttery at the same time but like the good buttery not the bad kind. Omg service was very like in n out which i liked it was fast and convenient. Deff will be coming here for sure again.<//text>

The service is usually great. The wait times and portions when its busy are both horrible. I've come to this location when it's super busy many times and i have noticed they are very conservative with the fries. Then I've come at not so busy times and the whole box is full of fries. I wouldn't mind if it was cheaper and had that little of fries but not when I'm paying about 8 bucks for the meal. Overall though, the food is good. Greasy and good.<//Review>

<text>The chicken is good but any place that charges you for extra sauce isn't really out for the customer. This place is even worse than the average stingy restaurant. In most of them you can make it through your meal if you ration the sauce but there is no chance of that here. They intentionally don't give you enough so you have to order more. Shady and underhanded. There are plenty of places where the food is just as good while the service is much better.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Chicken was flavorful.  Texas toast was good.  Line was long but moved quickly.  Lemonade was a bit weak. ***Update*** 1/29/19 Chicken portions have been cut in half. I have been shorted items (chicken and toast) as well on separate occasions. This location has definitely gone downhill in the past month or so.  I will no longer patronize this location and suggest that you don't same.<//Text>

Raising Cane's is consistently good. If you are craving chicken fingers and that amazing sauce then there is nothing that will quench that desire like Cane's. It's a little more expensive than most fast food but it's always worth it. I was surprised how fast this place completed our rather large order too.</text>

The cashier gave me attitude for taking a spit second and saying something to my friend while I was in line and they weren’t to busy. I didn’t care to see her name tag because I was upset but I can say you should check how your cashiers greet people. The food was great though.< /text>

[5-STAR RECOMMENDATION] I absolutely love eating the chicken tenders/strips, the Texas Toast (make sure to ask to butter on both sides), and the coleslaw. The Cane’s sauce is amazingly delicious. I would highly recommend checking this place out.< /Text>

I wish I saw more Raising Cane's around Orange County and definitely think they can do it with the quality of chicken they provide!

The food is good, chicken + sauce is arguably the best outside of Chick Fil A. However, their line format is inefficient and caused us to get line jumped by people behind us twice due to slow service at the cash register we ended up at.

If the manager is reading this, it has been scientifically shown that having a singular line feed into all available registers is more efficient because a slow register does not halt the progression of the line. Food for thought.<//Text>

I was hesitant to try this place. It was recommended to me by family. After the first bite into the very fresh yet juicy chicken... I was hooked! I try to go everytime I'm in town! Cane's Chicken never fails to satisfy my hunger! Wish we had a Cane's restaurant in Hesperia! 😩< /Review>

<Text>TEXAS TOAST!!!  My gawd it's yummy!  Also, the lemonade with a splash of sweet tea.  Oh and the chicken isn't horrible either.  Drive through takes a bit but it's like the other drive through place that makes the food fresh.  You know the one with a secret menu.  Some nights there are kids from the college handing out codes to have a portion of your sales contributed to various admirable ventures.  Be sure to pay it forward and turn these in when you pay.  Cost you nothing and helps our community.< /Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf50ab31fa95:0xd109c2548fdd4db9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>For my family and I, Raising Cane's is the best comfort food. The chicken never disappoints, it's flavorful and just hits the spot! I've been there at 9am or 1am, the food it's great!  My only dissatisfaction is the drive thru and parking lot. Not only is it a nightmare, it's hard to navigate.  Good luck if you park anywhere near the drive thru. The downfall, it's soooooo good, the whole city is there.  Which ever you choose to dine in or drive thru, plan to wait. The lines do not move quickly so If you're really hungry bring snacks.  Otherwise, the food is great.  The staff is great. Everyone always seems happy through all the chaos and seems to work in harmony.</Text>< Pics>

The Sauce...

Can't get enough of RCane's Sauce, it's amazing!

The fingers are always good, and bread and fries too.  Really want one of these stores in Sacramento area</text>

There should be some parking lot attendant or something. The line is ridiculous at times and if you happen to park good luck getting out. Some people are straight up jerks. Greatest sweet tea in a fast food place. And you can't go wrong with the chicken. Love the simple menu. Grub!</review>

This restaurant served chicken tenders with fries and Texas toast. I only rated it 3 stars because they only have one choice for the dipping sauce. Other competition has up to 5 choices and even the small orders allow you to choose one sauce that covers the tenders and two dipping sauces that may be the same or different flavors.<//review>

This is the In-and-Out of Chicken Fingers for sure. Simple menu, fresh tasting, juicy, and priced right. The bread is a lot of soft chewy goodness with slight crisp on the outside. Sauce has the right amount of pow to it. Good clean atmosphere. Good fast service with a surprising amount of employees. I ordered a 4-fingers combo and received it within 1 minute of ordering at the counter. And the place was 80% packed at the time i ordered. That's just crazy.  The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because i feel there is a lack of variety and ingredients used.<//Text>

What does Raising Cane’s have in common with Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline?” They’re both SO GOOD.

Jokes aside, awesome service and great food at this location. Was thoroughly stoked to get my hands on some SoCal Raising Cane’s!</text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><review>Well Raising Canes is Raising Canes, what can I say. If you like it, you love it. If you don't like it, you hate it, and there's a Chick-Fil-A across the street for your preferences.

This Raising Cane's location is the only thing that is an absolute bust for me. It sits on Harbor Blvd, an already busy intersection but also sits close to the I-405 freeway, one of the busiest freeways in the region. Not only that, but because people go absolute nuts for Raising Canes, being on the farthest right lane just to get it, can sometimes be so backed up, nobody moves for 5 minutes. Not only that, but the parking here can be a little cramped, so if one person is just parked with their emergency lights, which I have seen plenty of times, the parking lot immediately gets congested because the line for the drive-thru.

Other than that, the food here is magnificent and I love the sweet tea. Nothing can ever beat my experiences at any Raising Canes.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dcdf50ab31fa95:0xd109c2548fdd4db9<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is good. The chicken is pretty good, but the real MVP is the sauce. Not sure why there's so much hype. It's not the best, but it's not the worst.< /text>

After second time went to Chick-fil-A and got 4 piece meal and was disappointed on how small the pieces were. The last time visiting Raising Caine's the pieces were as s as Chick-fil-A. Very dissatisfied that pieces were half the size they used to be. $8 for 4 small pieces of chicken is crazy.< /text>< Time>

Wow! When they told me this place only served chicken, I thought ugh... It was perfect. The portions are huge, that explains the not-so-small price. I really, genuinely, liked it. I'm definitely going back. The toast is to die for. Too bad the In-n-Out sized lines don't let me get my food quicker.</text>

Parking lot was a little gnarly. I parked and got stuck with everyone in the drive thru line when we left. Chicken tasted good but was just a bit greasy? Coleslaw was really watery and I had only one bite and tossed it. Last time I had Canes in Irvine was way better. I’m sure I’ll be back again - maybe just drive thru though. By the way there’s a Chick-fil-A across the street, how funny is that.<//Text>

The place has the best chicken fingers in town , no doubt about it. The issue is the drive through lane, some people sneak from behind(gas station) and cut infront of line of people that have been waiting up to 20 minutes.
I leave this one star review not because of the food or the service , "they both diserve 5*"  i leave this review in hopes that something will be done to prevent people from cutting in line, i been to this place multiple times and i have seen it happen atleast 1 time every time i go  , drivers almost crash eachothers cars or fight in the drive through lane , due to this issue.
Some people just dont respect others rights.
maybe place a security guard or a sign. During peak hours.</Review>

The chicken here is great, it always is  freshly made and hot.  The Texas toast and lemonade are spot on too.  The sizes of the pieces vary a lot some are a lot smaller than others.  Be careful because of the size difference sometimes the big ones are not cooked well.  I would back into parking spaces here because it is hard to get out when the drive thru is packed.<//text>

I had the 3 piece with fries and a drink.  They have Sweet Tea, which I recommend trying.  Their dipping sauce is great, and the Texas toast is tasty too!

It's a lot of food though, I could have split the "smaller" 3 piece meal I got with another person and been satisfied.  The 4 piece comes with a side, which seems like just way too much food.

Definitely worth trying out.<//text>

If you like chicken tenders this is a good spot for you. Chicken is well cooked, a little juicy. And the sauce goes well with it. The flavoring is nice, but a little light for me. Service is fast. Sweet tea is pretty good too.<//text>

<review>I have been to the Costa Mesa store several times and the food is always good. This day I went 9/24/18 around 3pm, not very busy but as I walked inside, I smelled trash...it was overflowing.  I was hungry so I ordered anyway. I sat down and the table was filthy, the floor sticky and noticed other tables with food residue still there. C'mon guys its not that difficult to clean up during the day and especially its after lunch your store should be spotless. I saw a group of workers just standing around not busy. Management needs to supervise or management needs to be managed better. My chicken finger combo was really good!<//review>< gmapID>

<text>Great consistent food. The few items on the menu are excellent and executed almost flawlessly. It's chicken tenders and french fries though.

Still, they're perfectly cooked and delicious!</Review><userid>117148046425396255897< /userid><Rate>5<//Rate><name>digitaldevolution< /name>< time>

The best part about my trips here is the quick, welcoming service. Unmatched without a doubt. I highly recommend recommend their lemonade. My favorite is the bod combo with an extra Texas Toast!<//review>

This was the first time that I have been to a Raising Cane's and what a horrible experience. After waiting in a line that was to the door for about 10 minutes to even place my order,  my son and I go sit and wait for my order to be called. Keep in mind they asked for my name when I place my order so that when it is done they call by name. When my name was called I went up to get my food and the lady ask me for my receipt. I said I believe I threw it away and she said well you need your receipt to pick up your food. What kind of place requires the receipt to pick up their food when they asked my name so that they could call me by name to pick up my order? She then called out another order as I was standing there in shock and the other customer also came up and she said I need your receipt and that customer also stated she did not have a receipt she think she threw it away the lady did not know what to do and would not give us our food. What kind of service is that? finally we both said we don't know where the receipts are at why can't you just give us our food? Someone proceeded to walk by and said it's okay just give it to them. I was baffled by that experience. Then I asked for an additional sauce because they one they give is very small and the lady said I'm sorry that will be another $0.40 for the sauce and I have to get back in line. The line was again to the door I told her I have to wait in that entire line to pay $0.40 for a little sauce and she said yes and would not give me the benefit of the doubt or kindly as a one-time customer service gesture give the sauce, she was forcing me to go back in line. What is going on here?? This was the worst experience for my first time here.They wouldn't let me pick up my order after they called me by name then won't give me 2 oz of sauce without charging and making me wait another 10 minutes in line while my food gets cold. Completely disappointed with the overall experience I will never be returning back to this location or possibly any Raising Cane's for that matter.</review>

<text>Eh...it's okay for what it is. The chicken fingers are very greasy and very heavy which means they are injected with solution. Fries we typical, nothing special. Slaw was okay. Toast was very bland. Missed opportunity to make it garlic toast. VERY GOOD LEMONADE is all I got for positive.</text>< Pics>

<review>My first time here and the chicken strips are pretty darn good. I think I'd have enjoyed them more if they had put the great sauces I was told about. I requested their Cane sauce and honey mustard but none were added to my order to go. Great wings, disappointed in service. Wings taste dry without something to dip them in. Double check your bag for sauces before leaving.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I usually love this place.  Great food and sides. This time I went early and the chicken fingers were cooked but dripping with grease. I felt like it was dripped in grease and put in the box without draining.  A mouthful of grease made it inedible. Next time, I am sure it will be better.  Bummer.</Text>< Pics>

If you like greasy chicken and unhealthy food, then this is the place for you! I went to this location shortly after they opened. The chicken was chewy and the hot sauce was very mediocre. Better to stick with Ralph's tenders... much bigger and tastier, not to mention less expensive. Or just go to the best fast food chicken restaurant, Chick-fil-A! It's right across the street. What's the deal with Cane's anyways? All three locations I've found were built next to this superior competitor. Oh, and what's the deal with that toast? Is it in case the chicken and fries don't give you a heart attack first? I'll give it 2 stars because I was hungry and it appeared to be real chicken.<//Text>

Not terribly impressed with Canes like everyone else seems to be... The bread wasn't WOW. Nothing popped out to me... Honestly KFC is better. The only plus to canes was the chicken was very moist</text>

<review>So i have been coming here on a weekly basis for the past 2 months or so, and today my experience with the employees here was phenomenal. The food was great, and my order was called by the time i filled my soda and sat down (today a little less busy than usual) and about halfway through my meal the bus boy cleaning the table next to me offered to refill my drink, which is above and beyond his duties. I would recommend this resteraunt to anybody looking for some delicious chicken.</review>< pics>

<Text>Man oh man , raising cane's is my favorite fried chicken. Place , the only con about this food chain is that they only have really few location in OC . I love how crunchy the chicken is , how good their sauce is and how nice their employees are . Their drive through is always fast idk how they do it but even when it's really busy I don't feel that it took me more than a minute to order my food , pay then get the food and leave.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Text>Great food here. Chicken is tender and not dry. It’s mandatory that you dip it in the sauce. The toast is also fire. And go ahead and add a sweet tea as well. Thank me later.

I miss living in Las Vegas and being able to go to Canes all the time...</Text>< GmapID>

The portions here when you order to-go are ridiculously small, 4 chicken fingers feel like 2! If you go to the Tustin location, they'll give you a larger portion compared to this location. I thought it was only a one time thing but I everytime I go here through the drive-through they give me small portions. Raising Cane's is good overall, one of my favorite restaurants. Also, the chicken fingers here are a little bit more greasy. They give a lot of fries though. Another thing, the coleslaw is almost always bitter so if you are looking for coleslaw and you like it a little more creamy then just go to KFC. I wish they could give bigger portions when you order to go and a creamier coleslaw. I hope they fix this soon.</review><user_id>105849752156926316856< /user_id></record>

Absolutely pathetic! We went there to have dinner and they closed early so they could go home and watch the Super Bowl ! There were at least 6-8 more cars of people that wanted to eat as well and you lost out! Not everyone watches the super bowl and they have list me as a customer permanently!</Text>

We've been going since their debut in California years ago...but tonight was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Our chicken tenders were TINY! This was the first time we were able to finish the box combo and also the first time we were still hungry after we ate the whole thing...
That's how tiny they were. We thought that they might have cut the tenders in half.
We are hoping it was just a one time thing. If they did knowingly make this change and are sticking with it when we try it one more time, we will not be coming back and we will definitely tell all our friends and family who we recommended it to not to go. We love the original thick, juicy, well-breaded tenders we've always gotten so we really hope to see that again.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

After passing by few times with ridiculous line of cars  lined up to get into the restaurant, I finally decided to give texas style chicken finger a try. As expected, I waited about 30 minutes before we reached the ordering windows. I ordered the box combo along with sweet tea to-go. By the time I brought the food home, maybe 10 minutes ride, the fries and toast lost their crispiness and warmth. The sweet tea I ordered was not a sweet tea at all, tasted like a blend and water down version of the actual sweet tea. The coleslaw tasted like it came out straight out from the can or something. The chicken fingers were crispy outside and nicely cooked inside. Their dipping sauce was what distinguished this restaurant from other chicken finger joints. For next time, I will definitely try to park and eat in the restaurant.< /review>

<username>Eric Tam</username><Date>1517962365275<//Date><rate>3< /rate><text>Never in my life would I think a fast food chicken finger place would be so packed and popular; in fact there was so much cars in the drive through that it bled on the street. You can think of this as the chicken fingers of In-N-Out. But this place is a logistical nightmare. There's very little parking and you will fight with the drive thru traffic. Getting in and out of this place is crazy.

The menu is simple and the food comes quick. Personally I found ti good but not great. Ironically it reminded me a lot like McDonald's Chicken Strip but bigger portions.The sauces was good and so was the lemonade. The garlic bread was a nice touch to round up the meal.

Around this area, there's plenty of dining choices but not for chicken fingers. The effort it takes to make it here is not really worth it.< /text>< pics>

My first time here and the chicken strips are pretty darn good. I think I'd have enjoyed them more if they had put the great sauces I was told about. I requested their Cane sauce and honey mustard but none were added to my order to go. Great wings, disappointed in service. Wings taste dry without something to dip them in. Double check your bag for sauces before leaving.<//review>

Love this place! I come mainly for the sauce lol. Only reason for minus star is the chicken tenders could be a little more crispy but overall pretty great!</text>

Upset at the service that I was given by the drive thru. They were very rude, the food was bad, and to top it off the order was completely off. These drive thru workers need to be properly trained and put into place. I will not be coming back here.<//Review>

Amazing chicken! The service is excellent and the chicken was moist on the inside and good breeding on the outside.  The lemonade is excellent and the sauce is wonderful. Canes originated in Louisiana and I see why people are obsessed with this meal... It's absolutely wonderful. Definitely a must try!!!<//review>

It's kinda hyped. Their buttered bread is pretty good but their fries are like the ones you find in a freezer aisle at the supermarket and there's nothing really special about their chicken. A lot of young adults frequent this place so it feels poppin on a Friday night.<//review>

Generous portions of battered & deep fried chicken breast.  Well seasoned,  moist and tender - unlike  dry & tough strips at Popeyes.  Tasty mayo/catsup based "secret sauce" for dipping. Crinkle cut fries were neither crispy nor golden brown & delicious.  "Texas" toast wasn't crispy either and was Rhode Island sized. Go for the chicken, skip the sides.</Text>

Amazing! A absolute favorite! I love this place. They have excellent texas toast and I love their coldslaw. They only serve chicken fingers however. Their Canes sauce is a one-of-a-kind sauce that speaks for itself. Hope you enjoy this fine establishment!<//text>

<Review>I love this place. The service is always quick and with a smile. Your food is cooked to perfection and, oh, that delightful sauce. If you like chicken strips, there's no other place you need to be. The Texas Toast is also a great addition and a bit of relief from the typical biscuits always paired with chicken.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Stopped in here after a day at Disneyland. I have eaten ate other locations but the staff here seemed much perkier. For a fast food this place is really good. The box combo came (which I recommend) came with chicken strips, Texas toast, cole slaw, fries and really good dipping sauce. The strips were really delicious.  I really like the sauce and put it on everything. I actually took a couple home for later.<//text>

This place is pretty darn good. Probably Chick-fil-a's only real competition... Lines are always out the door which is annoying but they go pretty fast. Get double fries instead of the slaw 😉<//Review>

Fast service and delicious, fresh chicken fingers.  Just be aware that their menu is less varied than In N' Out's.<//text>

They have great food here, probably the best chicken tenders I've ever had, but they need to fix their drive through situation. Maybe add some lines and cones or a worker outside to direct the traffic. I'm sick of people coming from Gisler Ave and cutting the large line that comes from Harbor Blvd.

Since my above review, a month ago, the restaurant has hired a security guard to try and keep the drive through and parking lot in order!</Text>

I'm not usually a chicken or fast food person, but this place actually surprised me. The chicken wasn't coated with flour so it was delicious. Will definitely come back. :)< /review>

If your not into Texas toast and fries just get six fingers and do NOT forget the Canes sauce = 8 and some change. Worth every penny!< /text></record>

<Text>I had really high hopes for this place since the line was soooo long (literally out of the parking lot!). It was good chicken, but just wasn't all the hype to me. The chicken was really juicy and tender but the batter was too bland. Didn't seem like there was any spices or much flavor on it. The fries tastes like the frozen crinkly cuts fries you make at home. Was unfortunately a disappointment to me.</Text>< Pics>

It is chicken, nothing over the top. To hear people speak of it you would think Jesus was in the back frying the chicken. It is good for fast food chicken. It is better than its competitors.<//Review>

My order was to go and the cashier made a mistake by having it as dine in. Then I told them it was to go. The cashier forgot to put my order in to go. I then waited for 30 minutes for them to realize they have made a mistake again. I then brought to the cashier and the supervisor on shift of the freaking debacle. Also, the supervisor does not know how to amend the situation and just stand there like an idiot. Great training management style Raising Cane's. Thank you for your absolute lousy service.<//Review>

We love Raising Cane's and have raved about them to friends and family for years. We were so excited that there were finally locations in Southern California. Unfortunately, this location doesn't do the brand justice. The sauce isn't the same. And, the chicken doesn't measure up to the many locations that we have visited in Las Vegas, Texas and Louisiana. We are proud Caniac club members but don't plan on visiting this again. Definitely try any of the locations in Las Vegas when to visit.</review>

Really good food and super lively place. Food is cheap, staff is nice, and the energy is very fun and loud. Only complaint would be the horrific parking when it gets really busy and how how hard it is to enter/exit the parking lot, but other than that would totally recommend to chicken lovers!</Text>

Despite a crowded Saturday, I did not understand the hype of this place. It's just chicken tenders and fries. The breading fell off easily. Chicken could use more flavor. Fries were decent. It's more for people who don't like eating chicken off the bone.< /review>

Love the food, love the staff. They always greet you with a warm smile. They even know us by our nicknames. One of our nicknames is Turtle...if the staff at the register that work lunch hours during the week , read this review, they will know exactly who we are!😂🤣😅

The chicken is really good, but the best part is the texas toast and then wash it all down with a good taste of their lemonade.<//Text>

Food was great! Came out in about 10 minutes even though it was pretty busy. The chicken strips are a little small but tasted really good! And the amount you get is really filling! Definitely would come back!<//review>

I waited nearly half an hour in the drive thru line to get my hands on one of their combos. Sadly, I can't say it was worth it. The chicken itself was juicy and delicious. They only use breast meat but as for the sides, I wasn't a huge fan. The coleslaw was bland and I honestly think mashed potatoes should be an option for a side. The Texas toast was decent but nothing to rave about. I did get their fresh squeezed lemonade which was pretty good. Overall, it wasn't worth the wait but if you're in the mood for some fried chicken, and you're in the area, give it a try.< /text>

The drive thru is always insanely busy but the chicken is so darn good it's worth walking in. The workers have always been polite and efficient! I dig it. My personal tip -- ask them to swap your coleslaw for a second piece of bread when getting a box combo! No extra cost and twice as much delicious bread ahh yes!<//text>

Great food! Wish you could get more sauce, but I guess that's the secret. Also wish I had known you could substitute sides so I would've gotten two slices of toast instead of toast and sauerkraut.</Text>

You guys NEED to fix the situation with your drive through where people come from the wrong way and cut into the line. It pisses people off and it blocks thru traffic. I've watched people get out of their cars yelling at each other about to start a fight on multiple occasions (this is not an exaggeration...they were banging on the car windows, flipping them off, yelling at them to get out and fight). I'm sure that's not the atmosphere you want right by your front doors. DO SOMETHING!< /review>

All of our food tasted like it had been cooked in old, burnt oil. Yuck! I get that it was busy and they probably didn't have enough time to switch out oil as much as they should, but their food quality really suffered! Because of the many great reviews, I am willing to give them one more shot, but the food tasted so bad that I'm really hesitating, and waiting until I get desperate for chicken fingers on a Sunday when chick-fil-a is closed.< /Text>< pics>

The chicken is good it's fairly reasonably priced. The lines are very long, including the drive-thru. And they don't justify the wait. It's good chicken but come on it's chicken.<//review>

Best chicken tenders ever.  If you are hungover this is your place.  There chicken tenders are the best blend of crispy, breaded and not overly greasy. Only minor down fall, no BBQ or ranch, but there special sauce is pretty good.<//Text>

<review>This is a great chicken restaurant! It is right across the street from a Chick fil A which is crazy, but I suggest that you try this place out. Parking will be tough, but the food is definitely worth it. It has a very In-N-Out style menu which makes ordering easy.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The first time I was introduced to Raising Cane's was in Las Vegas and since then I've been hooked.  It was only a matter of time before I had to visit their new location in Costa Mesa, and as expected we were not disappointed.  Probably the best chicken tenders and buttered toast I've ever had hands down!< /Review>

Simple chicken tenders and nothing more or less to it... The good part is chicken is really tender.</text>

This place takes forever to get your order, and twice they forgot about me. 20+ minutes for chicken fingers, when that's all you serve is unacceptable. Oh and be prepared for a barrage of terrible hip hop music blaring over the speakers.< /Review>< userid>

<text>I bought ice only. The food I'm not impressed I tried it before I got sick from this location the manager never returned my call,  I know I got sick from this location because I do intermittent fasting and this is only thing that I ate.

This was our 1st time here and so glad we stopped.  Chicken was crisp outside and moist and tender inside. Employees were very nice and explained everything well.  We already have told all our friends to stop in the next time they are in Las Vegas. We'll  stop again next time we drive through Las Vegas.< /text>

Great food, only two things that bug me. Everyone's names being screamed out, I wish they'd just speak into their microphone. Secondly, the armed guards being used to direct traffic are both unnecessarily intimidating and incredibly rude to our group every time. Cane's should reconsider hiring friendlier guards, and not having guns on All their hips... Other than that, you guys have done a great job of becoming a part of the community here.<//text>

<Review>Awesome place.  They take care of their customer.   This place gets packed anytime of the day so my family decided to go to drive thru.  We ordered the tail gate 25pcs but they screwed up our order, we only discovered the discrepancy after we got to our destination.  I called the manager (Ted) and explained our issue with the order.  He was very apologetic and offered to either get a refund or get the order corrected.  I told him we were far from the location and traffic was bad and no way we would go back.  He said to come back anytime and we'll make it right.

We finally came back after 6 weeks later but Ted was not working that day.  I spoke to the Manager on duty and explained our last experience.  I kept our last receipt as proof but fortunately Ted, the last manager, had noted our conversation in their system so we were compensated for our visit.  Lets just say we walked out of Cane's with a party tray of chicken!  Not only we didn't have to wait in line that stretched outside but we got our food within 3minutes.

These guys are awesome! Not only their chicken are the BOMB, their service is excellent!< /Review><user_name>Harold Hermosura</user_name>< time>

Open late into the night with fresh food and decent prices. I would choose this place over Chick-fil-a any day. The bread is amazing and the chicken has some of the best dipping sauce.<//Review>

Not sure what it is with this place. Interior service is fantastic, but paired with the slowest drive thru in Orange County< /review>

<Text>My kids wanted Chick-fil-A so as we pulled to Chick-fil-A on Harbor Blvd, as we did, across the street Cane's caught my eye, therefore I checked the reviews and it looked like I might be on the verge of finding a great new chicken joint. I liked the fact that the menu was simple, which usually indicates that they one thing really good.
As much as I might have enjoyed the crunchy batter, the chicken was a bit more greasy than I like.
I was excited about the Texas Toast, but felt like it was just cranked out fast enough to throw in my order.
Cane's gets much higher ratings on their coleslaw,  but unfortunately the coleslaw was just a small part of this meal.
If I was a teenager, I might have liked this a bit more, but the greasy factor is why I rated this just two stars.<//Text>< Pictures>

Not that impressed, don't know why there's such a line for chicken fingers. I tried it and yes if that's what I was craving and it happened to be right next to me I would go, but no way I would go out of my way or wait in such a line forchicken fingers.< /text>

Haven't been to one of these for 10 years or so since we Iived in Vegas. It's just like I remember...fatty, greasy, and so delicious. It ain't health food but these guys sure do know how to make some chicken strips. Oh...and they got some crazy good ice tea to wash it all down with.</Review>

Decent taste, although it’s not all that great. They’re on par with Chik fil A in terms of food taste but Canes is a bit more expensive. Wait times here are also “meh”. Good luck in rush hour.</Text>

Cane's is probably the top fast food chicken strips you can get. Better than any of the major brands chicken.

I still believe there is some kind of conspiracy surrounding Cane's. I have not found one yet that is not also next to a Chick-Fil-A and In-N-Out.</review>

Good food... bad service....  3 times I came here , twice they messed up my orders. I ordered the one with 4 chicken fingers and instead they gave me the 3 chicken fingers combo. I pay more for less.< /Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>I never thought I would say this but this is too healthy for my standards. The chicken fingers are juicy, lightly breaded and not what I call fried chicken. The coleslaw is bland, and the french fry's lack salt. The Texas toast needs some loving, frankly it's overrated. Overall, I'll give them another try in a few months... Good try!< /text></record></dataset><record>

It's a good place. Alot of people rave about it especially college aged students. I find the chicken just alright. No complaints, but nothing that makes it super special to me. Prices are good. Not alot of verity in the menu. You are basically just choosing how hungry you are. Really easy and simple. I don't have a problem with that. But I go back to the chicken overall is just okay.</Review>

Don’t have Raising Canes back at home and I really like it. Only gripe is on weekend nights it can get busy and be a really long wait time. Once someone took my order and the guy wouldn’t let me grab the other guys’ order (it was the same thing), the other guy was Mathew and I was Matthew. Waited 15+ minutes (I counted) and they finally gave me a replacement. No sorry, no compensation, just my order I waited 15 minutes for. Parking can be hard to find too.</Review>

If you're a chicken finger lover, thus, you got to visit this place. Pick any chicken finger combo of your preference. Don't forget the chilled lemonade on the side for this hot days.<//Review>

Don’t trust the hype behind this place. The only thing on their menu that does have flavor alone is the Texas Toast. Everything is bland and has no flavor. Unless you add sauce to it.</Text>

This place is famous for their chicken, and I can definitely see why. While the prices are a tad steep, the chicken was the juiciest, most tender meat I've ever tried.<//Review>

Chicken strips were fresh and very good, although breading was just average (either breading at KFC is much better), size was quite small to good sized - varied wildly. Cane sauce was garbage and unedible with the strips - basically a poor excuse for thousand island loaded with black pepper. Fries were way too salty, bread was fresh but butter/spread had a slightly sour taste, and iced tea was just ok.

All in all this place is WAAAY over hyped and the strips are just slightly better than Carl's Jr (when fresh - can be hit and miss), but w/ the lack of available sauces I'd say it was a tie.</text>

<review>I had access to Cane's every single day when I lived in Louisiana, where I attended LSU. After graduating in August and moving back to my hometown in Los Angeles, I did not think I'd ever get to have it again (unless I went all the way to Vegas), but low and behold, this location in Costa Mesa opened up and it has been a God send in allowing me to have my Cane's fix every now and then. This stuff is immaculate and I'm glad it's doing well so far away from Louisiana.

<Review>Way too busy for just a chicken place. Traffic blocks cars trying to exit from eating inside so they can point out even more how their time is more valuable than X. Traffic blocks highway entrance. Inside it is like an amusement park. Meals are a tad expensive but delicious. If you buy an arnold palmer, they charge you for a whole lemonade, (more expensive) only give you half of it and send you to tea, then wont give you other half of lemonade for a refill Palmer, why the heck charge me for a whole lemonade then?? Atleast give me the other half of what i paid for. Mom was smart and just got an extra cup to make two Palmers haha moms. It was not a fun experience but the food was ok, kinda understand why people would go drive thru though. Stinky environment and long waited service.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf50ab31fa95:0xd109c2548fdd4db9<//Gmap_id><Rating>2</Rating>< Time>

Very fast and great service. On the phone or through the drive thru.

I drove from fullerton all the way to Costa Mesa, drove way past the orange location to save time. Orange is nuts.</Review>

Had to wait 45 minutes to get our food. they threw it away because we were sitting outside and their loudspeaker doenst go outside which makes no sense at all. They were polite and made it on the spot but having that be my first time experience I am a little hesitant to go back. food was delicious but service was below average.< /Text>

I thought the sides were better than the chicken.. Seemed like a glorified KFC. I don't understand why there is always a huge line out the drive thru. The prices are good though.< /text>

Great chicken, fries, Texas toast, sauce (as always)... But the parking lot is always a pain (has been since they opened 2 years ago)... Need to open another somewhere nearby to offset the traffic.< /Review>

1st time at this location.  Good food,  but the parking is horrible! It's a very busy place. We came around 9:00pm and the traffic was ridiculous. Need a system with the drive thru like what In-N-Out & Chick-fil-a does to move the line along.  Otherwise,  food is good.  The sauce definitely made the dish.< /Text>

<text>It was in late October 2015 that the very 1st Cane's in California had opened. I arrived a day before that, and to my surprise, I was the 20th person to camp out. I already had a Caniac Club card from Texas ready, so by next morning I gathered my things, ordered a box combo and won my 1st "Free Cane's for a year" card, a free box combo card, and a T-shirt. This jump-started my habit of coming to order free food every week, which I've been doing for the last 29 months.</text><Rate>5</Rate>< Name>

The place was soooo busy. But there were tables available inside. I'm not a huge fan of chicken fingers but they were delicious. The coleslaw was really good too.</Review>

<review>Drive-thru line is always long and spilling onto Harbour, but it moves quickly! You can only order in combos, but everything is great. I usually get the "caniac combo" and share with my boyfriend and it's more than enough for the two of us.</review>< gmap_id>

<review>Raising Cane's Chicken is probably one of the best fast food places to go eat at. Food is absolutely delicious (their Cane's Sauce is bomb af). The only problem is the LINES!!! The wait may be worth it but even the drive thru gets hectic. Chicken is bomb, long lines, but worth the wait.<//review><Date>1484342630626</Date>< Rate>

<Review>The food is delicious, but charging almost 50 cents for an extra sauce when I don't even get it half the time is ridiculous. Either pay more attention when you're packaging the food, or don't charge so damn much for something that isn't guaranteed to make it with the rest of your food. You don't see In-n-out or Chik-fil-A charging extra for their sauces, and you can guarantee those will make it in your meal every time.< /Review>< pics>

It also sells the best fried chicken you can buy at a restaurant.

I live in northern utah, but I make the 7 hour drive to Las Vegas (the closest location) as often as possible and I've never missed an opportunity to eat at canes multiple times while I'm in town.

Finally, the sauce is to die for. I recommended getting extra. Also make sure to get the texas toast (which you will crave for the rest of your life) "buttered on both sides."< /Review>< gmapID>

This is a stop that we usually go to for my girls. The chicken tenders isn't favorable so you'll need to dip it with sauce. The girls like it so that's all that matters.< /Review>

<Text>This place is for CHICKEN BEGINNERS ONLY.  If you're from the south or Midwest don't come here,  you'll only be disappointed. The best thing was the bread and it's the type you'd use to make a bomb grilled cheese. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE RANCH.  It's very sad.</Text>< pics>

<review>Drive through is a nightmare when it's busy, the line needs to have an open lane for people coming from the Denny's side of Harbor or an employee directing traffic. I've learned to just dine in instead of navigating the drive thru. I initially thought the chicken was bland and was in dire need of ranch dressing. But after going a few times I've fallen in love with the Cane sauce and I guess the chicken being bland is due to how much flavor the Cane's sauce has. I'm not a fan of coleslaw so I sub that for extra toast and the fries are overly salty which I also sub for toast. Wash it all down with a lemonade, it's definitely worth the up charge< /review>< Rate>

In terms of chicken fingers, this is the spot. It's the only main thing they sell. Small sides and drinks but, don't expect variety. Just delicious chicken tenders.< /Text>

<Review>On this day I took my daughter for dinner, inside was a young man that was obviously on drugs he ended up falling asleep with customers and employees unable to get him to wake up.several customers approached the young people working in the restaurant but they just responded that he was still breathing. Finally I seen one of the customers call 911. Well police came along with an ambulance and finally woke the young man up..long story short ..the food is ok. But I feel that the restaurant having so many young people working without an adult has or can cause major safety issues.Due to major safety issues I will never eat here again..<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Restaurant staff members are not friendly at all, also the meal had one side only of cane’s sauce, the chicken fingers and fired were not hot enough, the fries and the fingers were served carelessly and fast and it were not cooked well, they didn’t leave any forks as well in my plate, I got to come back to ask one of their unfriendly staff for a fork, she handed me the fork while giving me a cold 🥶 look as if I came inside to shoplift the restaurant and without even apologizing for that !!!!!!!</review>< pics>

Ok. The food...5 stars, its chicken strips, fries and bread, but they know how to do it. The dining experience...well, it's freaking packed. I came w my girls on a Thursday night and we had to wait for 15 minutes for somebody to leave so we could grab a table. If you like a place that's hoppin w people, this place is for you. FYI, they told us the drive thru is a 20 minute adventure, so plan accordingly.< /text>

< review>
It was in late October 2015 that the very 1st Cane's in California had opened. I arrived a day before that, and to my surprise, I was the 20th person to camp out. I already had a Caniac Club card from Texas ready, so by next morning I gathered my things, ordered a box combo and won my 1st "Free Cane's for a year" card, a free box combo card, and a T-shirt. This jump-started my habit of coming to order free food every week, which I've been doing for the last 29 months.<//review>

<Text>The best chicken fingers I've had... chips were crinkle cut... reminded a bit of McCains... think that might  be a Canadian only reference... the special sauce was nice also the honey mustard went well as well... would have like to seen more sauces? Plum? Hot sauce? BBQ? Ranch? Only two plus ketchup.... although the ketchup  dispenser was mildly interesting... i think it was a pressurized dispenser..  came from a tap... cool... overall nice place and literally the best chicken fingers... still can't  believe the person ahead of me bought 100 fingers... lolz< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>3< /rating><text>Good food but the service is slow at the drive thru. Odd because their menu is limited to pretty much just  chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw, toast and drinks.  Also the parking lot is horrible. They need someone out there to guide traffic or set up cones. Im always ready to honk just in case someone tries to back out into me or if cars in the opposite direction think they can cut into the line.< /text>< Pictures>

It is very simple, but very good. There are four items on the menu (each one with cane's chicken fingers) and all of them are very similar. There are coustom orders and even buying their fingers in bulk for a catering event. The fingers themselves are quite good, but are even better when dipped in cane's sauce. Cane's sauce is the perfect sauce for chicken fingers tasting like a type of ranch with a cajun kick. Finally, their crinkle cut fries are amazing, way better than del taco's</Text>

Best chicken fingers ever, but a little costly. A little too oily but still good.</review>

This fast food joint is the best.. I like the freshness of the chicken, fries and omg I love the Texas toast thats the main reason I visit Raising Cane's is especially for the toast 😍.  I like the fact that it's open until 3am in the morning because I get off work at 230am so it give me 30minz to get to them.< /text>

The chicken finger recipe says it all and the sauce is awesome! But give me a break charging .38cents for an extra dipping cup when you order the sandwich combo!!!! REALY rasing canes.</review>

I'm underwhelmed.  Nothing special about this chicken.  Ironic that they are located directly across the street from Chick-Fil-A which I feel is much better.</Review>

It's okay. A bit over rated for my taste. They basically only have chicken fingers in 4 variations in combo sets. One with three pieces and cole slaw, one with four pieces no cole slaw, one six pieces with cole slaw and one with three pieces in a hamburger bun with no cole slaw. Fries and drink included in all combos. Chicken nuggets for adults 🐓< /text>

<review>I was hungry. I satisfied my hunger. But...I just didn't see in this chicken what everyone was telling me. Unfortunately, my chicken was soggy and greasy. Now, I like fried chicken, and I prefer a fried chicken that borders on dry. This chicken was far too moist for me. I expected the breading to be crispy, but it was soggy. In fact, my chicken plate was completely soggy inside it's styrofoam container. I went to eat a piece before i left the drive thru and was greeted with a soggy mess. Either the meal had already been in the container awhile before it was served, or Raising Cane's needs to reevaluate using styrofoam (esp. in environmentally conscious California). Will I return to RCs? Maybe. But, I will not go out of my way when there is Chic-Fil-A right across the street.< /review>< Name>

It's was ok for my first time here the only two things I like about this place was the crush ice and that toast bread, well let me star by saying that the frys are just frys and they where too salty like the ocean and the chicken was ok I think they need to put more flavor into the breading and it would be the best place to go for fried chicken. I've never put rate restaurants but you need better frys and better breading please thank you for reading my review.< /text>

Never go thru the drive thru.. typically if you park real quick it only takes a few minutes to get your order. Park behind Dennys.<//text>

The restaurant was loud. The food was ok. I didn't know a chicken finger was that big of a deal. It isn't a restaurant I will be running back to.</Review>

I had a bad experience with my order that I had to wait until fixing it plus I got a free sauce scratch sticker and when I went up to get it I had to wait in line wait until for the register to put it in as his manager to swipe his card and of cause the computer froze twice in the middle of the process I asked him why not just give me the sauce and you do this afterword at lease I can enjoy my meal with my family but he refused< /text>

< Review>
What a Horrible fist experience, I’m staying at a hotel next to this place and walk in there with my service dog holding my dog in my hand Kevin to manager Mr. hotshot very rudely kicked me out of the restaurant and I was ordering food to go so I go back and leave my dog at the hotel and come back to talk to a manager and order some food so I can take back to my motel Since i really wanted to try it,Come to find out he’s the manager and he refused to take my orders gain  and very rudely kick me out of the restaurant again, So I’m just wondering does he not like me and being racist since I am Persian Iranian?</Review>

(Translated by Google) Fried chicken specialty. He would lack to offer milkshakes and ice cream. The environment is very modern and young. Special to spend little and go with friends. It is open until dawn. I give it three stars because the tables and seats are not clean. 🍟🥤🍗

(Original)
Especialidad de pollo frito. Le faltarian ofrecer malteadas y helados. El.ambiente es muy moderno y joven. Especial para gastar poco e ir con amigos. Esta abierto hasta la madrugada. Le doy tres estrellas porque las mesas y asientos no estan limpios. 🍟🥤🍗< /review>
