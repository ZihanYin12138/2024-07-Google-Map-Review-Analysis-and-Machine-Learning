As a 16 year monthly renter I was surprised and disgusted when Enterprise proposed raising my monthly rental cost by 400% without any warning.  Not the way I treat my long time loyal customers in my business.  When I asked the local manager why such an increase, the response was "Enterprise needs to make money"  Needless to say, my car rentals with Enterprise have been suspended.</text>

We had a terrific experience with the Enterprise Car Rental in Grover Beach.  They picked us up at our RV park so that we could retrieve our car, and the service was speedy and professional.  Our rental car exceeded our expectations and was extremely comfortable.  We thought the rates were reasonable.  Bill and Garrett both did a great job.  We'd rent from them again, for sure.< /review>

<Text>This location is by far the best Enterprise car rental location in my opinion.  Ther are professional, and willing to work with you when you need extensions or anything at all. The location is extremely clean and easy to find. The employees are extremely friendly and always greet you with a smile. They will pick you up they will drop you off. It is a One-Stop car rental shop. They always try to find you the best price or deal for the best vehicle you need. I couldn't ask for more. thank you 5th Street Enterprise car rental in Grover Beach California.</Text>< resp>

Unbeknownst to them, I received a car that was smoked in and had to change it out in Las Vegas, Both locations treated me so good and was so sorry I had to endure a six hour ride in a smoky car. Grover Beach Mgr was great and gave me a discount on my weekly rental. I would definitely use them again!!</Review>

We have a  motorhome and love to camp; however, we decided we didn't want to be towing a vehicle each time we traveled.  Enter Enterprise!  We reserve a car at our destination, Enterprise picks us up to bring us to their office to fill out the necessary paperwork and we have a car for the weekend!  When we return the car, they bring us back to our camp sight.  Works for us!< /Review>

The Grover Beach Enterprise is defiantly my favorite now. The employees never let me down and are always in a cheerful mood. They either have the vehicle I want or they upgrade to a better vehicle which is always a great surprise. The vehicles are always clean and ready to go!<//Text>

The service was great. The pick up time was short and quick. They even picked me up from work to get the car. I ended up needing longer than I expected and they accommodated me for an entire week when I originally only planned on 2 days. When I took the car back I didn’t even have to go inside. They met me out front and I was done and on my way in less than 5 minutes. Great price was an extra bonus!<//Text>

<Review>I always enjoy great service from the Grover Beach Enterprise office. They are kind and considerate folks who work with you on getting a comfortable vehicle at a competitive price. Their courtesy in picking guests up at no additional charge is a policy that keeps me coming back when I need a rental. Never had a bad experience yet after many years with Enterprise; I cannot recommend them enough!<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>I've rented a handful of cars from Enterprise and have never had a problem until now. They wouldn't take my card anymore. The same card they've taken EVERYTIME. I even offered 2 give them a $300 cash deposit. I am a local. Born and raised. They r losing business. I made the reservation on line, like always.  They waited till I went there and that's when they refused my card and cash. They should have honored what the website says. I will NEVER do business with them again<//review><user>106950337857625983319</user><name>Simone Parent< /name>< Rating>

< Review>
The staff people are always polite and courteous.  It's a very busy location and they are juggling a lot, and constantly multi-tasking; however they remain calm and polite.  I do find that this location is too busy for its geographic space.  It's hard to find parking to simply return the car.  It's not a pleasant atmosphere at all and the cleaning process is occurring right in front, in the midst of all the action.  Lastly, my most recent car was very dirty both inside and outside, which was a disappointment.  They simply didn't have enough staff to handle the number of customers at that time.  I am considering going back to the SLO location next time.< /Review>

I rented a car from the Grover Beach Enterprise - nice car, no waiting which was nice.  I became frustrated with the limited hours, but the manager (I think her name was Dale) went beyond what was expected to help me.  I really appreciated this.  I can't say enough good things about her willingness to help and her high level of professionalism.</text>

<Review>Positive notes: The attendant who helped me find the car was very nice. The price was very clear and I knew what I was paying for.  The time it took from beginning to end was reasonably short.
The car ran good.
Negative notes: The gentleman behind the counter was not very personable.
The parking for the rental cars seemed to be a bit of a circus. They were parked down the street, around the corner and parked on the main street.
Finding the car I rented was like looking for a  piece to a puzzle.
The driver and passenger seats were stained and did not look very appealing.<//Review>< response>

<review>I am grateful to have Enterprise in town. the pick up and delivery service is nice. I am glad i did not need to go to the airport to get a car. That saved me some money.

<review>Service was excellent but I was disappointed with vehicle condition. The vehicle was ready for the pasture. The drivers side carpet was wore to the floor the rear window didn't seal shut all the making the wind noise annoying for the passengers and there was a hole in the ceiling above rear view mirror where a part fell off and was not replaced and windows and outside needed to be cleaned. Like I said they were courteous but Enterprise usually keeps their fleet in better condition.</review><Date>1557463840057</Date><userid>107086672210877686835<//userid><gmapID>0x80ec59343b45d3b1:0x7a27cd9ba081cbbb<//gmapID>< username>

The staff was friendly and courteous.  They processed the pickup and drop-off efficiently and got me on my way quickly.  I had to extend my rental by one day and they accommodated my request with professional efficiency.  I have rented from this location, which is only a few blocks from my house, on several occasions and have never been dissatisfied.  Very convenient and friendly.<//Review>

Renting a car was easy on the internet. Went to get car (Buick) and company didn't even own one. Was told to take Dodge caravan as upgrade. I wanted something good on gas and comfortable that's why we went with Buick. Ended up with Hyundai. It worked out fine!  Car was pretty nice!<//Review>

WOW!!!  What a great job from all the staff. From the management to the other team members going above and beyond their job duties. They were able to accommodate me and my family of five in a vehicle that we could be comfortable in while visiting on vacation.  It's always refreshing in this day and age to receive extraordinary service. Keep up the great job!!!< /Review>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Incredibly Displeased.  I reserved a car on line this morning, however i was called shortly afterward and told they would have no vehicles available at the time requested.  I was told they should be able to accommodate me with a vehicle by 4pm or so. So I waited all day, hoping for a call back.  When I received no call, I called the office.  After getting lost on hold a few times I was told they were working on getting me a vehicle by 5pm.  At 5:30pm, with no call back and unable to get through via phone, i went down to the office once I noticed they closed at 6pm. I waited in the office until after 6pm, at which time I was told they would not be able to set me up with a vehicle.  I decided to walk back home to let off a little steam.  I wasted the entire day waiting for a vehicle to attend to a family emergency.  If they would have told me that morning they would not be able to accommodate me, I would have tried to make other arrangements.</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Experience was quick and easy. We couldn't get the Van we wanted because they needed to replace a battery in a key fob, I would of went and got a battery and paid for it myself had they let me, so that was a little annoying. But overall a good experience.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>I work remotely but do a bit of local travel using a rental car.   There is nothing better than having an Enterprise Car Rental a few blocks away.

The staff is very helpful and pleasant,  but never plentiful.   For some reason, this ia a very busy locations and they always seem understaffed.

Although extremely convenient,  I do have a couple of complaints.

First, the cars are always filthy on the outside.  Maybe it's because they are shorthanded or the proximity to the beach, but the cars are always dirty.

My second conplaint is related to their Saturday hours.  They close at 12 noon, which  can be inconvenient.

In total, this location is a good representation of Enterprise's great customer service.<//Review>< Pics>

Enterprise Grover Beach has the best staff!  We rent a car about 2 or 3 times a month and they always have a clean car or even a truck for me!  I needed a truck and they found one and had it ready for me at pick up time.< /Text>

I'm a regular for years now and have watched the quality of the rentals drop over the last year or so.  These days I'm consistently getting cars that are filthy, are displaying persistent and distracting service lights/messages, Sirus systems are not registered and blue tooth pairing not working.  I also called and asked for a specific brand of car which was not provided.  I told the guy and the counter about my displeasure and he just shrugged it off...implied they would try to do better next time... but this was a 'next time'.  Can expect "only game in town" type of treatment I guess.  Opportunity knocking for a competitor?!?<//review>

At the rental location, the rental wasn’t ready nor available at the time for pickup. The agent state he would call me when car is available. I waited for a phone call, but I had to call back to check If a car is available after 45 mins. I wouldn’t probably gotten a call if I didn’t follow up. Car rental should be available at the time for pickup due to reservation booked.< /Text>

GET IT IN WRITING!!!!!!!
They quote you one price and the stick you in the end!!!  Car was dirty when I picked it up and then they over charged me $60. They apologized and offered me a discount which amounted to a big whopping $10. Drive extra distance to Santa Maria and get a car there.< /Text>

< review>
Small number of vehicles available and you have to settle for a type of vehicle you really did not want.  Many times upon renting had to go straight to the car wash to have the car washed and cleaned.  Many times have had to go straight to the gas station and fill up prior to leaving town.  The staff is friendly.</review>

<text>Willie worked on my tax return and suffice it to say she did so in a fast and efficient manner. She gave off an air of utmost professionalism and expertise in her field.

I had stock investments, multiple w2 forms, and Willie was able to do all of this before my lunch break was over.

If your taxes are more complicated than what you can manage on turbo tax, then going thru a professional office such as this location will save you so much time and ache.

Already an hour has passed and I have confirmation that my return has been accepted.

Cheers!<//text></record>

<Review>Excellent service and consistency. I saw the same person as last year and his remembered me. The receptionist also remembered me and even though I showed up 20 minutes early for my appointment, I didn't have to wait and was able to sit down and get started right away. Everyone is very knowledgeable and knows what they're talking about, and their friendly, polite, and professional. During tax time when everyone is anxious and confused, they are calm and comforting.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b741b8a0c43f:0x9dbb1ddbbb720b36< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The tax professional I worked with was great, but there was some confusion as to my appointment due to a burst pipe at my original office and I would've hated to have had to come back, luckily I didn't need to. Also, when I called in for a pricing estimate, the person I talked to did not give me an accurate estimate compared to the ultimate cost. Still worth doing, though, and a very friendly staff.</Review>

You charge too much!  Flat rate of $250 is more reasonable instead of $350-$450.</text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Staff not knowledgable about taxes or products. I felt like we were scammed into going in there and paying 300 for an advance we couldn't get. I had already done the taxes in 15 min and could have filed for free. Waste of 300. They told me on the phone I didn't have to pay if we couldn't get the advance! We were never giving a pricing sheet  or told when I called and asked.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
I was told how wonderful this restaurant was by some friends and it did not disappoint. We had a pleasant time during Sunday brunch on the patio. The French rolls and butter were just right and served repeatedly. The champagne was free flowing and my beef bourguignon was delicious. Family business is run with the best friendly service. Definitely recommend if you are in San Juan Capistrano and it's right across from the Mission.<//Review>

The food was excellent but the service left a lot to be desired. Our waitress seemed as if in a hurry despite having only 3 tables. She knew absolutely nothing about the food that was prepared. Finally she managed to bring a Togo container for us to scoop our dessert into. Wow I guess a $200 biil does not include putting our dessert items into a Togo container despite our other waitress putting our main meal left overs into a Togo container.</review>

My husband and I found this restaurant just needing a place to get out of the rain. What a gem! The people are friendly. The food was outstanding from the shrimp cocktail, a perfect Rose from Provence, and finished with a Salted caramel gelato to die for. We loved it! Wish we lived in San Juan Capistrano so we could eat there more often.<//Text>

First time to visit.  Restaurant is small.and very cozy. Great feel to it.  Service was excellent.  The food was amazing. House salad had their special creamy vinaigrette.. wow! Delicious.  Dinner and desserts were also delicious. Really good portions too. Highly recommend and I will go back again. I would say it's a nice hidden gem in south Orange County.<//Text>

<Text>If you are seeking an evening of true delight, this is it. I enjoyed a Valentine’s evening dinner with my girlfriend, and we both raved for hours about how much we enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and owners. It truly felt like we were part of the family. Highly recommend and will return!</Text>< Gmap_id>

What a great restaurant with very good L'Hirondelle Restaurant. The prices are a little on the high side but if you are like me you will want to lick your place when you are done. Make sure to room for dessert.<//text>

C'est magnifique!! Ambience, excellent service and food. You have a wonderful view of the Mission across the street ,also great for people watching. Very romantic setting, which was perfect for celebrating our anniversary. Also good for small groups.

Currently, due to COVID, patio dining only. You must wear a mask, menus are disposable and all staff exercises all protocols. Tables are spaced 6-8 feet apart.

A reservation is recommended, as patio seated is limited. There is street parking, or use the parking lot behind restaurant, which is a little past the street entrance. Go past the entrance to lot, then there is a walkway to reach check in and patio.

This is an upscale restaurant with casual vibe. Although indoor dining is currently closed, the decor and vibe is definitely French, including lighting, art and collection of sculpture lining the shelves of the walls. It is intimate setting that is quite Parisian.

Extensive wine list, sold by glass, split or bottles. California, French, American, Australia and New Zealand vineyards of sparkling wine, champagne, burgundy, bordeaux, merlot, Malbec, cabernets including Tattinger, Piper Sonoma, Pouilly-Fuisse, JFJ and others. Corkage fee $20, and vintages can change due to availability.

Starters include pate, brie and fruit, escargot baked in garlic sauce, stuffed mushrooms, frog legs in wine sauce and french onion soup. We chose escargot and Mushroom Farci. Escargot was very tender, and garlic not overpowering. The mushroom had an excellent flavour, shrimp was succulent.

For entrees, you have choice of petite plate or full dinner of chicken, steak, lamb, fish, shrimp or salmon. The difference is for petit plate either/or potatoes or vegetable medley, full entree has both. The petit dinner is great for small appetite, but if you're hungry get the full entree!

Recommended are Beef Bourguigon and Petite Atlantic Salmon. Bourguigon is full of flavour, with slight hint of red wine sauce. My husband was quite pleased at his melt in your mouth goodness. Vegetable medley of yellow squash, carrot and asparagus paired very well with salmon. Just right amount of dill, it was magnificent.

Make sure you leave room for dessert. Because it was our anniversary, we received a complimentary chocolate ice cream with strawberries (topped with candle), but we also enjoyed cherries jubilee. Note about jubilee -- due to health regulations, they do not prepare the dish at table, it is brought to table after it is prepared in kitchen. One order will feed two!

I recommend this for the ambiance, service and patio experience. It is centrally located, and as mentioned, wonderful for romantic dinner or people watching at lunch. We will visit again when COVID protocols allow indoor experience. There are other items on men we want to try! Bon appetit!<//Text>

Would give it a 5 but the parking remains a huge issue for all Reston town center restaurants except Jacksons (which is the only one with no parking charges).</Review>

Table was cleaned before we sat, and the outdoor area is small and shady. I tried the Kobe burger, and it was a taste I never had before in a burger (and I'm a burger fiend). Not sure it's the type of burger kids will enjoy with th caramelized onions. My mother had the Atlantic Salmon, and she said it was a spot on with the salmon and the sauce they used. Would come again to try out the dinner menu next time.< /text>

Love, love, love L'Hirondelle. Everything I've ordered has been wonderful...and I've ordered about everything. The food and service is always 5 stars. I also always order the Piraat beer. Really accentuates the food.< /Review>

Plenty of parking, attentive wait staff.   Complimentary French bread with butter; butter is good but bread was a bit dry that day.  We had the (obligatory) escargots which were plump and delicious, swimming in garlic and parsley butter, so good we used the bread to soak it all up.  We had Special of the day, Petrale Sole in a bed of herbed mashed potatoes - perfectly cooked and seasoned for me (might not be salty enough for some people), and Watbrurst with garlic fries, also good.
We sat in the patio shaded by blue umbrellas and serenaded by the sound of a water fountain.
Definitely recommend this place.</Text>< GmapID>

<review>We had a wonderful meal here.  It was on the way home from San Diego decided to go on a whim.  I have always wanted to eat dinner, but it was noon and stopped here.  Limited dine-in.  There is a patio to the side, we preferred to dine in. The gentleman who assisted us was either the owner or manager, bur he was cordial and knowledgable.  I had a delicious version of split pea soup, served whole with a delectible broth and vegetables.  We had a fruit salad equally delicilous and a platter that included their signature dish, beef burgundy.  We had mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary so we received a dish of ice cream.  Everything was wonderful.  Can't wait to return for dinner.  Lovely ambiance.  Romantic old building across from the Mission San Juan Capiatrano.< /review><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I love this restaurant and drove down from L. A. On Super Bowl Sunday only to find it was closed even though the website noted it was open. Not to worry... Will try again soon.  The best food, service, and wine.  The outdoor patio is lovely too!<//text>

<review>Like the swallows for which it is named, this country French bistro serving haute Parisian cuisine is certain to delight even the most discerning convive. The family-run gem serving meticulously prepared dishes from original French recipes delivers heavenly flavors from its modest kitchen. From the peppercorn béarnaise on the expertly prepared filet to the red wine reduction on the bourguignon, and from the cherry glacé on the duck to the dill béchamel on the salmon, each sauce pairs perfectly with its protein. The delightfully creamy mashed potato and thoughtfully varied garden vegetable accompaniments carry forward each flavor without distracting from the main course. Start with the hot bacon salad and end with the berry custard or cherries jubilee flambé. Don't hesitate to sample the intentionally curated wine list, expertly paired upon request. While the food alone is motivation enough to return, the personal service is the icing on the cake. The ambiance of dining in a friend's garden creates a relaxed setting. Unlike the swallows, one is advised to make more than an annual pilgrimage.<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dcf1e6e39457ef:0x2202abbc7b6afb3e<//GmapID></record>

Subtleties of palette I had forgotten existed until my memory was refreshed by the truely incredible cuisine.

If you are a foodie, you must come here!!!

They deserve a Michelin Star!

To quote a fellow patron and fellow Yelper, who obviously has much more education than me (I).

"Not just the food but the courtesy (and professionalism) of staff and welcoming etiquette of the owners (and staff). This is a special place which is just that, a rarity in this region.  The owners (and staff) are people of genuineness and authenticity.  They have a gift of making you feel  part of their family in just a few words."

<Review>For years I have been wanting to try this charming looking restaurant, and last week it finally happened! What a pleasant evening - everything from service to deco, not to mention the food was exquisite. Loved the option of "small plate" which leaves room for dessert. The sole was delicious! Will definitely return.</Review>< pictures>

I have not been here for 19 years since I moved away and happily, it hasn't changed. New owners have run it for 14 years now. That adorably funny waiter Wayne has passed away, but the food and the old world ambience is the same. Great food and a happy and nostalgic evening. I will be back.<//text>

This is one of my very favorite restaurants. The food is always delicious in the service is very gracious and the atmosphere is totally Charming. They have an outdoor patio seating and when the weather is nice it's a great place to sit and have lunch or even dinner during the summer. The owner is amazing and a very loved human being by so many people.<//Text>

The Rack of Lamb is amazing as well as the es cargo...yes that's right.. Snails.. Served hot in garlic and butter sauce... It's truly one of the best appetizers, and I'm a picky eater.

Delicious French cuisine choices; and kind attentive staff. Plus, the lovely historic district and atmosphere of San  Juan Capistrano and nearby unique Los Rios District surround the restaurant.  For lunchtime, there's also delightful garden dining.</Review>

<text>Terrible service, & the NY strip was tougher than shoe leather. 10 out of 10 will NEVER recommend. Went in for a birthday dinner and was just so dissatisfied. With the prices they charge I would have expected at least SOME service. We were in on a Sunday evening with a reservation. Only one of 5 tables & still had to get up and ask for some service. The owner wasn't in so apparently when the cat is away the mice felt free to play. Just horrid. Don't waste your time or money here it is clear they are going under.</text><rate>1<//rate>< gmapID>

This place has to be one of the best restaurants in the county! It's cozy, romantic, and has really, really great food! There is limited parking in the back. There are nice tables outside, with a fountain. This is substantial French cooking at it's best! They have all of my favorites. The lunch entrees are slightly smaller. The kitchen will try to make whatever you want!  You need to try this place at least once!<//review>

Delicious appetizers & entrees. Service was fantastic. Family owned business. I've had a number of dishes here and all have been  well prepared, from the steaks, duck or rack of lamb to the mushrooms, frog legs, French onion, or escargot.  Wonderful date night near the old San Juan mission.  Cozy lil restaurant with a European flair, a must try in my opinion. Oh, don't forget the deserts; tort for chocolate lovers, berry filled creme brulee or a Carmel sauce sundae. Of course there's more I haven't had a chance to try. The cost is quite reasonable for the quality of food.  Enjoy!< /review>

My husband and I dine at L'Hirondelle every wedding anniversary and any other time we are able. The atmosphere is inviting, the family that owns L'Hirondelle are very welcoming and the food is heavenly! They have a great beverage selection as well. If you're in the area and want great food, they're the place!</Text>

<Review>One of the few five star ratings I have given as nothing could have been improved.

One of the truly European restaurants my wife and I have had the pleasure of dining in in the states. After moving to the states in 2003 we yearned for European dining, high quality food not large quantity, a table that was ours for hours while lingering over an excellent meal, service that was always there but not intrusive, etc.

Ali has brought it all together. Ali and I found common ground in that we both attended school in Switzerland. That shows in his menus, choice if sides, and presentation.

Meals, bottle of wine, desert, coffee, and  aperitif only $130 with tip. A bargain for the quality, service and atmosphere.</Review>< pictures>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>Don't go to Europe to find an European restaurant.  This is it.  Charming "french country" decor with menu to match.  Always consistently good food. The husband and wife owners give attentive service.  Also allows you to "escape" the noisy din in today's "modern" restuarants thanks to the "open kitchen" concept coupled with blasting loud piped in music.  L'Hirondelle is like a peaceful oasis.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dcf1e6e39457ef:0x2202abbc7b6afb3e</gmap_id></record>

This is our favorite restaurant
The atmosphere inside is French country, the patio dining is cozy with a fountain and umbrellas, the food is excellent,  and the sevice is always personal, efficient and friendly. We drive 40 miles round trip at least once a month. Ali, the owner, remembers his return customers by name.< /text>

Great food across the street from the historic San juan Capistrano mission. Inside and patio dining.  Not inexpensive.  I found it to be a little pricy.<//review>

The owner (in the left) and his family are so welcoming, friendly and offer the best selection of wine in the area. I always love to go there. Their lamb is amazing and salads are always great. This is my picture with the owner 2 nights ago when my friend and I visited there for yet another awesome food, spirits and desert... I highly recommend it... At lunch time try eating in their enchanting outdoor garden with fountains and trees....</Review>< pics>

On Saturday evening we enjoyed:
Salad
Pate
1/2 plate of:
duck
peppercorn filet
lamb
creme brule
choc torte
ALL WERE EXCELLENT
We ate the whipped and roasted potatoes and mixed veg.
Those sides and the bread were excellent too.
Thank you Ali & Lisa.</review>

The three barbers here are top notch. You can walk-in or make an appointment. They offer fades to scissor cuts, so no matter the style they will hook you up!< /text>

Been going to Tony for haircuts for over 3 years now and I can honestly say that his skills are unmatched by his competitors in the area. I am always satisfied with my haircut and am impressed that the quality of it is still great. He knows what's he's doing.

He always got AM 1430 playing too haha< /text>

I've been coming here for my haircuts for the past four years. Tony is fast and skillful with his haircuts. He is also very good to have a conversation with while getting you a haircut. I recommend anyone to come get their haircut here.< /review>

It was $10 now it's $12. The guy is so good and I always give him $5 tip he's fast and efficient in cutting your hair.

I am stuck on this place. I only see one man working -the owner- and he is always very quick and efficient. I had 3 people ahead of me yesterday and was in and out of there in 30 minutes! Mind you, I always get my hair layered.< /Text>

Now I have to say she is one of the best. Plus, she is so pretty. Every time I go out of the shop, I feel myself glowing. Highly recommend it.< /text>< pics>

I always come here for my hair cuts because the two main male barbers always know how to go about the hair cut I want. Plus it's at a good price.< /text>

<Review>Tony does a great job at cutting men’s hair styles. I get the same type of haircut every time, so I can’t say if he is able to vary from the standard Asian male style. Reasonably priced, but parking can be tricky at busy times because of the nearby Chinese restaurant. Trying to catch him near opening when he’s fresh and there’s no line, because the quality of the hair cut declines when he’s rushed or tired (understandably).< /Review>< Pics>

My trash person must be the best because they have never missed a pick up in 3 years, I personally think it’s a little on the expensive side but that might be because there is only 2 of us.  I love their oversized pick up service that comes included. They always pick stuff up on time</text>

Slow. Always slow. The workers rove around just killing time. Three guys laughing it up and doing absolutely nothing for the hour and a half I was in line. Didn't even bother filling out the tickets that are supposed to speed up the process.</review>

Employee confronted photographers on a public sidewalk, demanded ID, claimed the sidewalk is their property, then "cambacked" in an aggressive manner.  Looked really silly for a grown man to act that way.<//review>

The employees really work hard to organize the traffic and make the service move as efficiently as possible. They definitely need one more weigh scales to make exiting more efficient. The cashier was friendly and fast to get the lines moving. I will keep this place in mind the next time I have to drop off large amounts of trash.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I have been paying to use the truck services in the school around lake Arowhead for years and never was asked to show proof of payment. Last weekend, and without  any notice I was not allowed to dispose of my trash because I did not have my payment receipt, which is in my permanent address 90 miles from here.< /review>

The following review will posted in yelp, google, my congressmen, BBB, Facebook, etc.

You forgot to pick my trash again. This happened 2 weeks ago and many times before. There was one time when you forgot to pick my trash for 2 weeks. If I have to pay you for this required service then you are require to provided it.</review>

I called to report that 2 of our trash cans have wear & tear damages and need to be replaced. Spoke with a lady at C/ S today, Wednesday,  10/16/19 around 11:30 am. I did not get her name but I would like to give her a big shoutout.  She was able to resolve my problem. She was professional and  very courteous.<//review>

I just spent an hour and a half waiting to get into the place someone please help I lost a whole hour of my life I can't get back. 9/11/2018

Good very good place. Which it seems everyone else thinks so.....

It's such a good place that I have gone 3 days in a row. Spending a whole hour each time just sitting in line waiting to get inside and dump my load. (Lol)

Someone please tell them they got to do some major expansion of the driveway because this whole business of sitting in line for an hour or more really sucks.

My productivity is Hindered thank you tho<//review>

Looking for disposal for your construction project? Avoid at all costs! 4 different times they were sopposed to deliver a dumpster and they flaked each time. Gonzalez the route supervisor neglected his duties to deliver a dumpster today on our palisade property.
This is not a professional outfit. They were happy to take our money. They failed on every level of a professional organization. I found for 3/4ths the cost another firm willing to handle our needs. Avoid at all costs!</Review>

(Translated by Google) I just went to throw trash from my house and after I was two hours on the line waiting for my shift they ask me for a $ 120 deposit when I think that I do not bring the minimum of trash what is $ 30 and nothing else brought $ 100 and then I did not they let me throw the garbage I think it's not fair that they should have a little more consideration in these cases is my opinion

(Original)
Acabo de ir a tirar basura de mi casa y después de que estuve dos horas en la línea  esperando mi turno me piden $120 de depósito cuando yo pienso que no traigo ni el mínimo de basura  qué son $30  y nada más traía $100 y pues No me dejaron tirar la basura Yo pienso que no es justo que deberían de tener un poco más de consideración en estos casos es mi opinión< /Text>

I was wearing a mask, next in line, and no one was behind me, so I don't know why? I was uncomfortable with this but before I could tell her no, she told me she would help me with it. I didn't understand why but went over there anyways and checked out using the self check out. When I was done, she asked me, "Was that so hard?"

I won't be back. Albertsons stores are fairly clean, have nice produce, and generally has what I need, but the condescending tone of the employee that spoke to me today frustrated me. There are both alternative Albertsons and other grocery stores I can go to instead.<//Text>< Pictures>

I bought the wrong coffee brand last night and came in today around the same time to ask if I can return it without the receipt using the same credit card that was purchased with or if I could get an exchange for a different item. The cashier said that she couldn't do anything without the receipt but that I could ask the manager named Alex. I proceeded to ask Alex if I could exchange it for a different item because I had lost the receipt he then looked at me up and down as if to assess me and ask me why don't I have the receipt, what happened to it and what time did I buy the coffee at. He looked at me like I was plotting to scam the store somehow. It made me feel really uncomfortable to be treated this way by manager in front of other customers who were all looking. He sat there contemplating what he was going to say but ended up telling me no he can't help me because I don't have the receipt and as I was walking away he said that it's because of covid he couldn't return it. But just 2 minutes before that the cashier and him both told me that without the receipt they can't do a return 2 minutes later it's because of covid. All he had to say was that he couldn't do anything without the receipt but for him to sit there and ask me what happened to the receipt why don't I have it and what time did I buy the coffee at was unnecessary since he wasn't planning on doing anything about it. Very very poor management customer service.</text>

Very nice store...primarily a grocery store but has a variety of merchandise (especially for the holidays). Also has a Starbucks kiosk. Everyone seemed friendly and helpful. Produce looks great.</Review>

<Text>This is one of the least-changed places since I moved to San Clemente in 2002. It's nice to keep some familiarity among all the growth. This Albertson's has an advantage in an enormous produce area and a Starbucks with a couple tables next to it. They also have a pretty extensive booze selection along with a walk-in wine fridge. Pretty snazzy for a grocery store. I can't recall it ever having been noticeably messy or out of order. Important things to me: Milk and milk alternative selection: 5/10; butter selection: 8/10; egg selection: 7/10; cooking oils selection: 6/10; coffee selection: 8/10; meats: 8/10.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

One of the things that I love about San Clemente is how it's a medium-sized town that manages to keep a bit of that small town feel. This Albertsons is great because you get that small town feel as you walk around. It's not huge and open like some grocery stores and you get to know the cashier's a little more because of that.

Now to the reason that this location has the rating it has... I've never felt more offput, unheard, and disrespected by a manager before. I purchased something that was on a deal. I thought there was only one kind for this product, but apparently there are two. They were out of the one that was on deal and I ended up grabbing the other one and purchasing it.

After looking at my receipt I saw the price and went to stand in line with the manager. She'd just seen me purchase this product, she had to swipe her card on the register.

She grabs the paper as she had no clue what the deals were. And then she says she has to go back to the section and check the items. I was a bit confused because I'd already waited ten minutes to talk to her and she looked like she had everything she needed. She insisted she needed to go back as it was policy and I just said sure. She came back ten minutes later. Now I'm twenty minutes behind schedule and I have friends waiting on me. But, it was fine, we're almost all sorted.

She says, dripping condescension, you purchased the product that was not on sale. You grabbed from the top, not the bottom. Now I'm confused because I had no idea that there two types of this product. But, my mistake. It's fine.

"Do you know if you have the right product in the back?"

"I don't know, I don't work for the meat department."

"Well can I just switch these out for the correct product and get refunded the difference?"

"Sorry, it's store policy not to accept returns on perishables."

"So, I'm just stuck with this? You literally just saw me purchase them."

"I can't do any more for you"

Now, thirty minutes later, I drive up the hill to the other Albertsons and within 3 minutes if entering the store I have the right meat and the money back.

I have no idea what store policy she was talking about but I guarantee you I will set foot into that store again. A five minute, in and out, trip to the store became a forthy minute, wholly unnecessary, debacle.

I'll be sending a detailed email to corporate about the situation.<//review>

Pounded on door the remaining lazy staff were congregated around a register and just looked at me. Because we squandered this time here driving a few mins out of our way we passed a midnight deadline to book the hotel we wanted. Hopefully next time this staffs life won’t be so hard and awful that they can work the last 11 minutes instead of getting paid to look at customer and lock doors during business hours.

<Text>The produce at Albertsons is always the best in the area. The prices are very competitive and the customer service is second to none. The staff keeps the store incredibly clean and they show a willingness to ensure that every customer is a happy customer. On top of all that, like myself, Joe Albertson was an Idahoan. And that can't be a bad thing.<//Text>< user_name>

This Albertson's is your standard grocery store, nothing really makes it stand out. I use this location to cash my paychecks and to get money orders. Occasionally, there is a good meat or produce sale going on. Pricier than other places in town to shop for groceries. The staff here is very nice and courteous.<//review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Going downhill.  They got rid of self-check out.  So even the quickest of trips require a wait in line. At night with limited cashiers means at least 20 mins for what was previously took just a couple minutes.  Letting management or corporate know makes no difference.  So you are better off going elsewhere if you don't need to waste time in lines.< /Review>< pics>

The prices are generally higher than Ralph's and their meat department and produce are much better than Ralph's but the Cashier's are generally stuck up and snotty.  I rarely get a smile - or a genuine one at that.  They usually talk about inappropriate employment-related gossip right in front of the customer and IF I've been greeted with a "hello" it's under their breath and I couldn't understand them so I have to ask them to repeat themselves. (Not just on one occasion but on several and consistently)  I go here because the meat and produce is better than Ralph's, but I "enjoy" Ralph's because the cashiers are friendly.</text>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and they don't put their customers satisfaction first. Very rude and their high school aged staff hangs up on their customers after expressing the foul, and expired nature of their food. They don't respect their customers!
Bad management and even worse associates not worth the drive, money for spoiled food, aggravation for returning it all, and the headache of trying to explain yourself to impolite people.
God forgive these people handling other peoples food, its sad this day and age what the world is coming to.<//Review>

<text>Nice clean store. The have significantly higher prices compared to WinCo and Walmart. Good place for some deals if you are an ad watcher but I don't go there for the bulk of my groceries. Watch the sales though. I saw a ham on sale buy 1 for 19.99 and get one free. The exact same pack of ham is regular $7.29 at Walmart. I verified this by using Walmarts app to scan the barcode on the ham package in Albertsons. I do really Albertsons donuts.< /text>< Pics>

My husband & I shop all 3 of your Idaho Falls / Ammon stores.  We have the worst of customer service only at the Ammon location.  Deli personnel are rude and extend a zero helpful attitude.  We have actually had to argue with an assistant mgr. about the discount applying on wine when we purchased more than 6 bottles.  He advised only applied to 6 and number 7 8 9 10 11 12 did not qualify.  He advised he should know he was an assistant manager.  Had to call over the manager to resolve and allow us to purchase the 12 bottles of wine.  Have had checkers move us out of line advising another customer was headed to their check out before we were, even though we were already in line,  We were moved out and went to another check stand.  Had it not been a good cart of groceries we would have left the cart and went to another location.  We have a Broulins store opening in your proximity in the next year.  Might be wise to send your Ammon employees over for a little customer service training, not actually for a great deal on training.</review>

I would give the pharmacy 0 stars if I could. My wife and I just had a baby and needed her meds for the pain and when dropped off the script we were told 25 minutes. When we returned they told us no one would have told us that and said they would be done in the morning I showed up in the morning to pick them up since my wife was in too much pain walk and they were still not ready and weren't even in the system! This is ridiculous!!! I will never do business with then ever again</Text>

Always love the food here abs the atmosphere is great.
Usually fantastic service, but tonight we had a little less than a stellar response when asking for something special. We understand when you're answer has to be no, but we thought our waiter could never been a little nicer about it

We really miss the 3 and 4 course meals where you had 3 and 4 choices for each course at a fixed price.

Love the mac and cheese.<//text>

<review>Neat location with a retro interior decor. I was surprised to see so many menu options, which was nice. I would say it’s an upscale dining experience, but without the stuffy frills of feeling like you need to get dressed up— I think the majority of patrons were in jeans. No host to greet me, but I was meeting friends so after waiting a bit just poked around and found them, no problem.
My friends loved their food, but sadly my steak was over cooked. Not completely inedible, so no complaints from me, just not 5-worthy in my opinion.<//review><name>Noëlle Jeanminette< /name>< Rating>

I have been to Jack & Charlie's about a dozen times. Yesterday's lunch (2/3/20) was the first substandard meal/service that we've had. The entrees were still delicious, but we had to track down the waiter (we had never seen him working there previously) because he never checked if our meal was ok (condiments were needed for the burgers). Then we ordered the banana cake for dessert. It was delicious as long as we didn't eat the bottom, which was burnt. We showed the very black, nasty tasting crust to our waiter who basically told us oh well too bad and handed us the bill. Waiters at most reputable restaurants would have taken it off of our bill. He did not offer this so we took it out of his tip instead. I'm sure we will be back again, but hopefully the experience well be back to the usual excellence.<//Text>

It is sweet, light, and refreshing.</Review>< user_name>

Jack & Charlie's is in the basement of Visalia old jail house. It's quaint like something out of the roaring 20's except in today's standards. There's a red rose or red carnation on each table and you are seated at a table with white table cloth with nice silverware place settings and cloth napkins. It's very classy and brings you back to an era that has been long gone.
Service is very good and the food is good. They do have a bar area that makes fantastic drinks.< /Review>

Our waitress was very friendly, but obviously had several tables to take care of. She was constantly rushing from table to table and seemed a little flustered. We did notice a table or two that had been seated after we got their food and drinks before we did. Could have been because we'd ordered specialty drinks, but did make us question why our section was so much busier than theirs.<//Text>

Always a great menu. Creative and delicious. Their cheese appetizers are so special. The staff is about as attentive as any. You will feel welcomed and appreciated. A must if coming to Visalia or if new to town, a local favorite.<//text>

Food was salty, had the beef stroganoff.  Good bread and butter.  Waiter rarely came by to fill my drink ... probably since I was having water.  Everyone else was very friendly.< /Review>

Went here for my 10 year anniversary. It was my first time here recommended by friends. Great service and great tasting drinks. The food was rather expensive for what you get. It tasted good, but wife and I were expecting bigger portions ...  $100 later and we decided to end the night at our local favorite spot called FUGAZZIS.<//text>

I had never been to Jack and Charlie's before. It's not a really well known place since its location is just off the beaten path. But it was very high end and charming. The drinks were delectable and the appetizers were unique and tastey. Very cozy vibe, all of the employees greeted us and asked how our night was going. The bar tender was unpretentious, welcoming, and down-to-earth. However everything is expensive so be prepared to spend.< /Text>

This should be a 5-star review.  Sadly, it isn't.  I will say, however, that the last two times I visited here was for lunch and they were severely short-staffed, apparently.  As a result, service was what a marketing professional might refer to as "leisurely".  Food was very good, though -- surprisingly good for this area -- "still-thinking-about-it-days-later" good.<//Text>

Had business dinner, baby shower celebration and just a date night. Almost never is it over crowded. But on a night with time constraints I'd make reservations just in case. If it's busy it's about 60-90 minutes kind of busy.</Text>< GmapID>

Update:

Greg, the owner, called me immediately after my review and invited me back for another chance to experience his restaurant.

Tonight: 9/23/19, we returned on a Monday night. Our server was Jeremy. He was polite, courteous, funny, and made our experience at the restaurant exquisite. He was timely with our drink orders, and made it a point to ask us if we wanted water, down to bottles or tap, and what kind of bottled. We didn’t expect that at all, but that was really nice. Afterwards, we had their Mac N Cheese again, and everything was delivered on point. My wife and I both had their Filet Minon. I had their four-course meal, all of my servings was outstanding, as well as my wife’s.

We had the pleasure of meeting Greg, and it was an absolute pleasure. We will be back in the future, we really appreciated Greg and his restaurant.

Original Post: My wife and I came here 8/9/19, excited as we had tried Vintage Press and The Depot, both were terrific. We arrived around 7:15 PM, and were seated in the bar area because it was pretty busy. It took at least 10 minutes to get drinks ordered. Then after we had our drinks for another 10-15 minutes, our waitress came and took our order, she had intended just for us to order an appetizer, however we wanted to our food ordered since we could see things were taking a bit longer. After we waited for another 20 minutes, our appetizer, MAC and cheese was delivered, which was delicious. After we had finished, we waited another 30 minutes for our dinner to finally arrive. We were offered another round of drinks after our appetizer was finished, which we agreed, however those didn’t show up until after our dinner had been served. That was another extended length of time.

We understand a popular restaurant being busy, however the main reason for the 1 star rating was that my wagyu beef had terrible texture, firm on the outside but very rare on the inside. Also, there were pieces of fat bordering the edge of the cut. I found it pretty disappointing I couldn’t fully finish this $65 plate. Also, my wife’s chicken had blood in it. We had to google to see if it was even safe to eat. She ate very little in fear of food poisoning.

We also found it incredibly rude that our waitress had time to talk to people she knew personally, talking about texting them and going on about their personal lives, as our service had been pretty poor, along with our food.

I asked for the check and feared waiting any longer. Before tip it was $145. For the price of our drinks and meal, we were extremely disappointed.

We enjoyed the atmosphere and the appetizer, however I don’t think we’ll be back for a return visit.</text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>I can't believe there are no reviews for Jack and Charlie's!!! This is one of our favorite restaurants in Visalia. Classic, but basic, art nouveau design. If you are looking for true exciting, creative, market-fresh bistro-syle food, this is your place. Think Wolfgang Puck in the early days. I could go on and on about favorite dishes we have had there--unique appetizers that you won't find anywhere (I don't care where you go), foie gras, great fish dishes (depending on what is fresh), beef stroganoff made with steak and fresh noodles, steaks, fabulous bread pudding. Specially selected wines, unique bar drinks and a specialty in absinthes. Great bar scene. I hesitate to tell you how good this place really is as I selfishly don't want everyone to go.... The only disappointment about this restaurant is the menu sometimes changes---as it must---but the excitement of trying new dishes typically makes up for it.< /review>< response>

This was our first visit to Jack and Charlies and it was good, and bad.  The food was excellent, presentation was beautiful and the atmosphere was nice.  The night we were there, they were slow, with only 3 tables occupied.  After bringing our salads, they decided to send our server home.  The service had been good until then.  We heard from our server (before the service stopped) that they were owned by the Vintage Press.  We told her that we had given up on going to the VP because the service was so bad.  She said that she had heard that before, and ironically that's when our service stopped too.  It was a full 30 minutes from the time we finished our dinner until our table was cleared.  We ordered desert, which arrived 20 minutes later, and ordered another glass of wine, which never came.  Give it a 3 star, which is average between excellent in presentation and flavor, and terrible for service.</Text>

Be aware there is a new cook and the food is not as good! Also we saw a huge rat scurry into the seat of the booth next to us...we notified the staff and they continued to seat people in the booths! It's usually really good here so it might just be an off night....but server didn't know about menu, new cook and huge rat!</Text>

My fiance and I came here for dinner and it was the best experience and great tasting food I've had in a while. A small example of the service: they led us to our booth with menus and let us look over it.....we noticed the glasses on the table had water spots on them...the server came back and noticed as well. I said "it was ok" (it's not a big deal I know that happens sometimes when they run them thru the dishwasher) and in response he said "no, it's not ok, I'll replace these for you right away".....even tho that was just a small gesture it showed great customer service and quality of this restaurant. Would definitely recommend and look forward to going again.< /Review>

Great for a special occasion; had a fantastic anniversary dinner here. The duck and sirloin were great. The potato chips for a starter were just short of crack.</text>

<user_name>Tom Derr< /user_name><Review>This gem sports a new menu every day and is one of the few places where I overeat. It's the favorite of my wife and I. Every dish is unique. Every dish is beautiful. And all are mouthwatering and delicious. We've never been disappointed. Lunch or dinner, doesn't matter. Some folks may think it costly but they are wrong because food and fun like this is worth dropping a few extra ducketts for. Weeds out the parade of human debris you find at all the chains. Thanks Jack and Charlie...don't ever change.

Update: it changed. Our last experience was really bad. We had to ask for menus twice, the food was mediocre and poorly presented, the young man who brought our first dish didn't bring silverware, and when he did he placed them right on the bar surface instead of on a napkin. It seemed they could do nothing right. Adios.</Review>< pics>

This is one of my go to spots in the cool little down town area.  The food is great, however, I do order the same thing every time.   Beef, Filet Mignon (California) Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Shaved Zucchini, Cognac, Green Peppercorns 39... its fantastic and they give you bone marrow butter on the side.   Cant go wrong and some great local beer choices as well. No 805, but no point deducted.  Look for the red phone booth and head downstairs for a real treat.</review>< GmapID>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) A little discovery that Jack & Charlies, improbable localization, a mixture of French fashionable French cuisine, finally real cutlery with a real towel, slightly adapted menus every day (rather good sign), excellent bread, butter type US unfortunately that spoils the party a little, excellent fish (slightly spicy), beef strogonoff, pork ribs, muscular tariffs however, excellent service (thank you Matthew)

Une petite découverte que ce Jack & Charlies, localisation improbable, un mélange de cuisine française à la mode US, enfin de vrais couverts avec une vraie serviette, menus légèrement adaptés tous les jours (plutôt bon signe), pain excellent, beurre type US malheureusement qui gâche un peu la fête, excellent poisson (légèrement épicé), boeuf strogonoff, côtes de porc, tarifs musclés cependant, excellent service (merci Matthew)< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>Nice place to have an event! The indoor hall is a pretty spacious, with a big bar area and kitche. The outdoor is awesome. Really huge lot of grass for kids to run everywhere and space for everyone to sit and enjoy the party.  It was my first time @the Hall hope to be back soon for another party lol 🍺🌅🔥✌</Review>< Pics>

My little cousin had her 15 here. The venue gets the job done. It's not ugly. What ruins this place is the security. When your guest are entering they make you stop and look inside your car to see how many people are in the car. I've never been to a venue who does that. After the last song they were forcing us out. There were still people there and they were just throwing them out. Mind you we had a ton of stuff to load up and they are trying to rush us. I would never book this place. Finally when everything was loaded we had to drive outside the gate to figure out where my uncle wanted the stuff to go. They just shut the gate.<//Text>

This us why I'm so happy there is such supportive staff at Santa Monica Maserati/Fiat to make the process easier. They were very helpful and responsive to my needs. John, in particular, has over 20 years experience. Excellent experience!</Review>< userid>

<Review>I was immediately welcomed with a smile and warm greeting. Suzy was pleasant and extremely helpful as we started the process to have my vehicle serviced.

Ken quickly approached, listened to my needs and made me feel comfortable that my vehicle would be well taken care.

I couldn’t be more pleased with the quality of service and experience.< /Review>< user_id>

<Review>Spoke to Cynthia on the phone who was so kind to move my November 8 appointment to today. She gets 5 stars. My car simply needed a battery replacement due to a dead cell. My car was checked in today at 9:27am. It’s now 2:0pm and I still have no status on my vehicle and my assigned advisor has gone missing. I called to inquire and was transferred to three different people never once was asked even my name and my car information. Just be weary if you need a simple repair and are required to come here like I was due to a warranty you should expect to lose your car for the day. I miss my old McKevitt FIAT dealership in Berkeley.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2bb12a1cd5ec1:0xb5b90f9d4fbd18f4< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Went in today and everyone was polite. Got my car in and out in a timely manner. Suzy at the front desk was very helpful and also helped me financially. Will be going back if needed and would recommend to anyone.<//Review><user_name>domo hafield<//user_name></record>

< review>
I am  picking up my Maserati Ghibli from the Santa Monica Service Center. My service advisor is John and he was very awesome in handling my car and calling me back to follow up. I also had a positive interaction with the receptionist Suzie she was great too!  I recommend this location!</review>

<Text>I have had my Fiat since 2012 and love it. The service was great when it was Fiat. Now that they have merged it with Maserati, I am treated like a second class citizen. The service people are non-responsive and aloof. The receptionist is unable to provide the slightest information. They have no loaners. Overall the service is terrible. What a shame!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Maserati of Santa Monica is absolutely phenomenal Susie’s help me out tremendously when I first walked in. If any Maserati you need to go now go to the one in Santa Monica.

Thanks for taken such great care of me and my car.

Service center was amazing! A part on my gear shifter wasn’t working, and they scoured the place until they found the right part and fixed it same day! Even took care of my Uber home - top notch service!!</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>First of all, this is a very unhappy place. It's clear that the communication problems these people have among each other, as evidenced with how tersely they speak to each other, extends to how they communicate with their customers. If this is a service center, then they must have forgotten what the word service means. I was treated with indifference and almost a distain by the smug "service" personnel. They explain situations by text and are almost impossible to get on the phone to explain further. I'm definitely disappointed by the choice of the Fiat dealer to move their service to this terrible place. Not going back and would never recommend this place. They need a reset on how to actually deal with human beings. Pretty sad.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I’m the owner of an Alfa Romeo Stelvio and I’m taking the car for services to this facility since May. The people working here are amazing. Starting with Suzy at the reception, John Minor service advisor and Nancy the loaner manager. As Italian I really appreciate the effort and the genuine warm interaction that they display every time I come here. Please keep doing the great job, grazie.</review>

<Review>Went there for the first time today everybody there except the person who seats in front
( receptionist ) where great and professional.
First time around she was rude and not pleasant and I had to go back the second time when I walked in she was on the phone laughing and playing with her hair waited about 4 to 5 minuets she wouldn’t even look at my direction I just walked in the glass offices in the back and asked someone for help.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The deal with our daughter on her first car purchase was first rate. Even though we were buying an inexpensive used car, they treated us like we were buying the most car in their inventory. Thank you Mauricio Ortega, you are an excellent salesperson and thanks to the financial officer, you were very empathetic to our daughter ...

El trato para con nuestra hija en su primera compra de un auto, fue de primera. A pesar de que estábamos comorando un carro usado y económico, nos trataron como si estuviéramos comprando el auto más carro de su inventario. Gracias Mauricio Ortega, eres excelente vendedor y gracias al oficial financiero, fueron muy empaticos para con nuestra hija...</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Maricela at Caliber Collision on Reseda Blvd was extremely helpful, thorough and punctual. She explained everything to me upfront so I knew exactly what to expect. She was very thorough in showing me how the damage to my car would likely be repaired. She kept me up to date twice a week just like she told me she would. Overall she gives great attention to detail and it is apparent she takes great pride in her work. I would definitely recommend Maricela and Caliber Collision to friends and family in the future.

<Review>Jose C was super professional and transparent about the work my car needed. He kept me updated and aware of the status regularly. And made sure that I received good quality parts, not just the ones insurance would get me. Attention to detail and quality customer care will have me returning to Caliber Collision whenever our cars need work. My car looks better than ever and clean. I’m really grateful for the team at Caliber Collision, Reseda.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This was my second visit to Caliber Collision in Reseda. About two years ago I was sent there because the person who hit me had State Farm and that was the preferred repair location in my area. This time I sought them out because of the exemplary customer service and high-quality repair I had received.

William Woodward and his team took such great care of my Toyota 4Runner. The work was completed in a timely manner and the status updates from Caliber were on-going. They facilitated approvals and shared timelines with my insurance company and my rental car agency. While accidents and their aftermath can be stressful, William and his team made my experience as painless as possible. I am so pleased with the service I received and when I picked up my car today, it looked brand new! I don't know how they do it, but they remove any trace of the accident and return the car to you in its original form.

While I hope I don't need to visit again, I would use their services again without hesitation. If you are looking for excellent customer service and quality repair work, look no further. A huge thank you to everyone at Caliber in Reseda!</text>

<review>Unfortunately, I got rear ended and had to get my car repaired. Fortunately, everyone here at Caliber Collision was phenomenal. From the moment I spoke to someone over the phone, to the moment I walked in, and to the moment I left with my car in brand-new condition, everyone was great the entire time. Jose told me everything that they needed to do to my car and was extremely friendly while Marisela always kept me in the loop regarding the status of my vehicle. Would definitely come here again should my car ever need to and would recommend anyone to come here! Thanks, everyone!! :D</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1616181724724, 'text': "Hi Allen, thank you for your wonderful review!

Caliber repaired damage from accident and one could not tell the car had ever been damaged.  Personnel were courteous and treated us with respect.  Work was done on time.  Just like an old fashioned business which cared about its service and customers.</text>

I have used Caliber Collision, specifically this location, for several incidents and with several vehicles. Anytime I have had an issue with my car stemming from an accident or damage sustained to the car, Caliber Collision has routinely provided excellent quality customer service and repairs, with professionalism at the forefront of their work.

I recently had damage to my Jaguar by another vehicle and William at Caliber was able to promptly handle my claim and the subsequent repairs immediately. I am always looking for customer service that stands apart and above the rest and William was exceptional with the service he provided. Very polite, kind, personable, quick to return my phone calls and went above and beyond what was required in getting my vehicle in top shape and condition upon completion. William is a gem and Caliber should be lucky to have such a stellar employee as he.

I have been a long standing customer of Caliber and this solidifies my belief  in returning to places that time and time again provide excellent quality work. I will always choose Caliber for my vehicle and collision repair needs simply for the quality of work, the exceptional customer service shown by William and the Caliber staff and the incredible turn around time in which they are able to get their customers back into their newly repaired cars. Good job Caliber and William, you have a forever faithful customer in me!!</Review>

<Text>I was so upset when I found out my car was vandalized while I was at work (broken windshield, kicked in fender, license plate bent up, and other nasty dents). However, when I took it to Caliber Collision, they made my car look basically brand new! I was so happy with the results and they even give you a little car wash and my car smelled and looked amazing. Juan and William were super helpful and friendly during the whole process. My car ended being ready a couple days earlier than promised too. I couldn’t be happier with the results :)<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1603144188135, 'text': 'Hi britney weinstein.

Always hard to tell with cars, especially if you're not mechanically inclined, but I felt secure and like I could trust the reputation of Caliber.
As a result, my car was finished beautifully, and looks literally brand new (it's not). I've only been driving it around for a day, but so far I am happy. And I am confident that if I am unhappy at some point, my concerns will be properly addressed.
Every employee was polite and again, very helpful.

Definitely recommend for anyone who needs car repair.</Text>< Gmap_id>

I've had the good fortune, after having bad fortune with several accidents (none my fault), to have found Folk's body shop.  My State Farm agent suggested I go there as there was a claims office there as well.  Claims were supper nice, no hassle.

But Gary and the crew at Folks are just terrific.  They had my original damage completed on time as promised, they did lots of extra things just to make the vehicle supper sharp when I picked it up.  Couple of adjustments weeks later and it was good to go.

My son was involved in an accident shortly after my experience and told him to take it to Folk's as well.  Same experience, extremely happy with the work and timely completion - top notch workmanship, staff, office staff and an owner that cares around his customers, who are more like friends than numbers.

I highly recommend getting your body work done at Folk's.<//text>

<Review>Gone totally downhill since they were Folks; avoid Caliber like the plague

I used to have a really good auto body shop on Reseda Blvd called Folks.  They have been bought by some big corporation & now called Caliber.
I made the terrible mistake of assuming that with a name change only, they would not have become totally incompetent, but they did.  Just as one example, they texted & called me on a Monday that my car was done & I needed to pick it up tomorrow.  I asked, since I had planned on taking Wed off, if I could wait an extra day.  The receptionist told me I would be charged 100% on my rental if I did that since the car would be ready Tues.
So I go down there Tues, drop off the rental car, show up at Caliber & ask about my car – they guy looked totally baffled and said “It’s not ready!  Who called you?”  Who do they think called me, given it was a female and only one works there is the receptionist?  They also acted baffled as to who was sending me these texts that said it was done.
I asked them to STOP the texts (like they said I could do) since I didn’t want any more of their text messages.  Ever since then, they’ve been texting me nagging me to do this review, so now it is done.
The repair job was really lousy too – that 1st day after closing the door they were supposed to fix, the insulation was sticking out as it was not taped down properly.  Fortunately, I had to take my car to my normal shop & they fixed Caliber’s mess for free, so I didn’t have to go to back and do that hellish ride again – they are on Reseda Blvd in about the worst & most dangerous place I know.  They park their trucks full of wrecked cars right by the entrance so you can’t see a thing trying to pull out on that horrible stretch.
So, the location is terrible, the service is worse, and the staff is completely incompetent.  Yes, avoid at all costs!< /Review>< Rate>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I honestly have to say this is one of the best bodyshop I have ever been to. I been coming here since 2013 I have brought all my cars to get fix here from regular to luxury vehicle they all come out as if they where brand new. Everyone that works there is really good at what they do. Their customer service is always at a 100% . I normally deal with Mardick and he always keeps me in the loop of what's going on with my car. I just brought him my brand new 2017 Toyota 86 to get some bodywork repairs and i wouldn't have trusted anyone else but his bodyshop to do so. And as usual my car looks amazing. If you really  want to get excellent customer service and a nice experience I recommend you to go here.</Review>< pics>

<Review>I needed to get my car fixed at another shop because of the piss-poor job they did. The fix quality is horrible with missing things that you call and tell them to notice, but they miss anyway!!! A blind dog, which does not have thumbs, could do the same job. If you want your bumper attached with chewing gum, go here.< /Review>< Response>

I called ahead of time and asked the bed tenders about the 2oz special they had. I was assured that yes that's the deal.The post said they had 2oz Flower specials premium @ $180, private reserve @ $295 Top Shelf @ $235 and connoisseur @ $340. My husband went down, a 35 to 45 min drive down the mountain, 1 way!! When he got there they tried selling him some bottom shelf bunk smoke that we would NEVER get or considered.  We've ALWAYS got the top shelf, private reserve or connoisseur.  Today we wanted the connoisseur and they wanted to sell him bottom shelf for $340!! This isnt the 1st time they have tried to jip us. Time to change shops. Waste of time and gas.</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>I called ahead of time and asked the bed tenders about the 2oz special they had. I was assured that yes that's the deal.The post said they had 2oz Flower specials premium @ $180, private reserve @ $295 Top Shelf @ $235 and connoisseur @ $340. My husband went down, a 35 to 45 min drive down the mountain, 1 way!! When he got there they tried selling him some bottom shelf bunk smoke that we would NEVER get or considered.  We've ALWAYS got the top shelf, private reserve or connoisseur.  Today we wanted the connoisseur and they wanted to sell him bottom shelf for $340!! This isnt the 1st time they have tried to jip us. Time to change shops. Waste of time and gas.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Went in today as a first time, receptionist was really nice and was very helpful. Went into the back room and the girls were so nice and funny with a great vibe. Very welcoming shop. Picked up 5g of Runtz and got extra for being a first timer, then also bought a plug n play vape, getting a good deal with the battery. They had amazing service and prices even events coming up that they had mention. Pretty excited for their 420 deals coming up. Thank again ladies for the help and fun experience. Will definitely be back.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>mt burnin was really a really pleasant experience. First of all, everyone was friendly and willing to help. very knowledgeable about product, attentive, and kind. Xandriah really helped me on this visit and tbh it felt like I’ve known her for years!!! Right away her positive energy eased my nerves. (I get anxious visiting new dispensary bc of my lack of knowledge lmao) anyways, she helped me pick out some gas 🔥 🔥, recommended a chocolate edible that was hella worth the whole trip. I will definitely be back soon to get the stiizzy she recommended as well. Might I mention that I live in the high desert and it is WELL worth the drive.</Text>< pics>

First time here and I'm glad I came in! All the girls are pretty and super sweet. They helped me find a Stiiizy set up and I got a great deal 👍 Best place to pick up Stiiizy in San Bernardino for sure. They have a huge selection. I'm so glad I found this dispensary near me, definitely my favorite dispensary in San bernardino now. Can't find you on weedmaps, but glad you have a Google page!</review>

I’ve been out here in SB for about a month now and I haven’t been that impressed with all these dispensary’s near me now. Literally none of them unfortunately compare to LA dispensaries. BUT today I found the SPOT!!!! Mt Burnin is literally the BEST dispensary in San Bernardino. It smelt soooo fresh and it was so clean inside. The girls were super fun and welcoming! The budtender HOOKED me up with my first time patient 5g eighth deal and my weed was absolutely FIRE! If you’re not a weed smoker they also have many other products and great deals such as 50% off house wax on Wednesdays and B2g1 deals on prerolls n edibles! They definitely know how to make their patients feel hooked up! I’ll forever be a returning customer to you guys! Thank you Mt Burnin!<//review></record>

I had a upsetting time at this dispensary, Music is too loud! Can’t hear in there .The bud tender Dion forgot my pre roll after he convinced me to do a review that he worded.!!and he forgot to give me my stamp card. Also said since I bought $100 worth I can buy a moonrock for $5 but when I got home it was so small, I would have never bought it!! I should have checked my bag before I paid and left!! What a messy transaction ! I’m so mad . I won’t recommend this place, No one wears masks and bud tenders touch product without gloves. I asked my bud tender to please sanitize his hands before touching my products! Never again go there.!!</Review>

<Review>I found this shop on google about 3 weeks ago and I have to admit they are my favorite!
At first the outside was a bit intimidating but the second you walk in, they are super welcoming and friendly. It’s also so clean inside! Although it’s hot sometimes in there, they do give out complimentary cold waters n cold towels to make sure we are comfortable in line which I love because most places won’t cater to you like that. Also the deals here are DOPE! I love coming every Monday for the 5g eighths and if I come any other day I get my 4g eighths during their happy hour times. On top of that the quality of the weed is fire af! Definitely my new favorite spot !</Review></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been to so many shops n they never seem to just get it right. Until I found Mt Burnin. I’ve been coming here for about 3 months now and I've never gone  back to any other dispensary since! This is my SPOT! I’ve even brought a few of my buddies in here and they love it! The girls hooked us up with a 5g eighth and a free dab!
If you’re looking for a new spot to checkout , come here. They got everything you need! Easy parking, shop is clean, girls are welcoming and the variety of product they have is great!</review>

< review>
I’ve been to a few dispensary’s in the San Bernardino area and so far Mt Burnin has been the best local dispensary near me.

I love that they always keep the shop smelling and looking clean. Very sanitary.

Budtenders at this location are such a great help, SUPER welcoming and informative!

The deals they offer are also incomparable to the other shops near me.
I’m a vape head so I always come in for their 15% off vapes every Tuesday! The wide selection of vapes they carry makes you feel like a kid in a candy store! They carry Stiiizy pods, Stiiizy Live Resin carts, Plug n Play, West Coast Cure Carts and they will soon be carrying SQRL pods ! Very excited to try those out next time I come in!
Check out this marijuana’s store near you! You won’t regret it!< /review>

China really helped me out, I wasn't sure what I wanted or needed and was a first time patient.  She hooked it up! Awesome service. 10/10 will definitely be returning.

The 8th of flower 🌹  was divine, we got a fire 🔥 goodie and my fave, some live resin badder 🧈 !! It was one of the best experiences Ive had in a while! I loved the vibes and would definitely do it again! Shout out to receptionist for being on top of her game and keeping the lobby clean!!</review>< user>

She was very informative, very pretty and gave us stunning products. The 8th of flower 🌹  was divine, we got a fire 🔥 goodie and my fave, some live resin badder 🧈 !! It was one of the best experiences Ive had in a while! I loved the vibes and would definitely do it again! Shout out to receptionist for being on top of her game and keeping the lobby clean!!<//text>< Time>

When I got to the back I was really pleased to see such a wide variety of products & flower on the shelves. I’m a big smoker and I like to try everything I possibly can. I was able to purchase their brand new live resin stiiizy carts & west coast cure carts & their STNDRD gummies with 20% off for being a first time patient! They offer so many great deals, I cannot wait to be back! Forsure the best marijuanas store near me. Thank you guys !< /Review><username>Madison Lopez< /username></record>

<Review>Amazing flower selection, was looking through weedmaps for a specific strain that a friend recommend we could not remember the name specifically. Fortunately we  passed by this location and after I described to the staff what I was looking for was not disappointed with what they recommend. The most knowledgeable professional staff I've met in a San Bernardino dispensary.< /Review>< user>

< Review>
Came into the shop as a first time and was looking to get some vapes and flower. I ended up getting 2 stiiizy pods for a good prices and an eighth of flower of Master OG and also got hooked up. The bud tender also showed me around for new products they had recieved raw garden and west coast cure pens and wax. I spent over $100 and they hooked it up so much. Will def be coming back thank you skye and the rest of the gang. Greeted me as well felt so welcoming.<//Review>

Amazing flower selection, was looking through weedmaps for a specific strain that a friend recommend we could not remember the name specifically. Fortunately we  passed by this location and after I described to the staff what I was looking for was not disappointed with what they recommend. The most knowledgeable professional staff I've met in a San Bernardino dispensary.<//text>

This is the best dispensary near me for sure 🙌 They always have Stiiizy and good deals on them too 🤗  Definitely always coming here for my pods, and the buds are pretty awesome too! I just got hooked up by their pretty budtenders with some Boss OG 🤤 Their happy hours are one of the best times to pick up bud, that's usually when I'm there 🤗 The customer service here is the best in San Bernardino and definitely part of what keeps me coming back! Thank you ladies for always staying stocked on the best products and best flower 🥰<//Review>

<Review>Had a great experience coming in today. The staff was very helpful and very nice. They followed CDC guidelines which made it better for me and very comfortable. They were also very welcoming. There was a few strains I got to smell them and they smelt amazing. They were called Maui Wowie, kosher OG, gelato cake, and marathon OG. Thank you again to the staff for making a great experience.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Best selection of quality bud in San Bernardino, Been coming to this. Cannabis dispensary for over six months now, and over time they continue to improve in the selection of products. Aside from friendly budtenders, they have a wide range of strains at reasonable pricing. It's not overpriced like I hear some people complaining. If you want a 5 dollar gram, they have those available don't be surprised when it's not the world's best weed. Like with everything, you get what you pay for.
If you like concentrates as i do, check out their 10g deals! Crazy good quality and prices.< /text>

MY GO TO SPOT IN SAN BERNARDINO!! 🥇 love coming here for their bomb wax and can enjoy taking a few dabs before I leave!! Has a wide range of prerolls the variety makes it exciting I always try something new 💯 shout out to the girls for putting me on this cbd tincture to help me sleep definitely helped me find what was more beneficial for my medical needs. Very spotless place, helpful staff with great vibes. 10/10 experience can’t wait to be back</Text>

My one stop shop in San Bernardino 🥇🙏 always has the best service and knowledgeable staff came in looking for cbd cartridges and pens for the first time not knowing too much but walked out knowing everything I should n with the right product tht they felt like would suit me best!! 💯 Never disappointed from their flower, wax and cbd products they always keep up with reliability thank you so much 😊 never a dull moment inside. Always going to grab one of those lemonade shots from now on goes perfect right beside my dab on my way out</Review>

This place has the gas! And great prices to match. The staff was awesome. Looking forward to going back////////oh wow! If you’re not going here and you smoke, you are honestly missing out.I am a regular customer here and I believe in quality. There is not a place that can touch this place in quality and service. Not only that the price is crazy. I’ve shopped at the cookie store and I can say I wasn’t impressed, I have been impressed every time with Mt. Burnin.💯🔥🔥🙏< /Review>

< Review>
Second time coming this cannabis dispensary & I truly got to say it’s certainly one of the best ones out here in San Bernardino. They have top tier quality products such as stiiizy, plug n play & future 20/20 joints also the flower is grade A stuff which is amazingly surprising for the area. Some of my favorite products & strains I look for when trying out a new cannabis dispensary. The staff is actually knowledgeable, friendly & has given me one of the best experiences as a newer returning patient as far as dispensaries out here in the San Bernardino area go. I highly recommend coming here they will make you feel like family :) I will continue to return.</Review>

< review>
Second time coming this cannabis dispensary & I truly got to say it’s certainly one of the best ones out here in San Bernardino. They have top tier quality products such as stiiizy, plug n play & future 20/20 joints also the flower is grade A stuff which is amazingly surprising for the area. Some of my favorite products & strains I look for when trying out a new cannabis dispensary. The staff is actually knowledgeable, friendly & has given me one of the best experiences as a newer returning patient as far as dispensaries out here in the San Bernardino area go. I highly recommend coming here they will make you feel like family :) I will continue to return.< /review>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>Good afternoon,

This message is for whom This concerns.

I want to thank everyone for staying open. I am always coming back due to the good quality of meds and the excellent customer service. "( But )", I have a huge concern when it comes to the temperature at the location. You got have all us patients and those poor girls working under a humid hot environment and not only I have to go in there and sweat just to pick up some medication.

This is a suggestion and request I am making as a pt., Get an AC unit or fix the one you already have. AC that is going to cover the front and the back.

I've been in the cannabis industry for 20 years, trust me the AC is only a scrap that would be taken from the business funds. I very dislike walking into MT. BURNIN to literally just burning up just to hand and get my ID baking in the back waiting in line for my meds. Please get these Bud tenders an AC!!! They work very hard and they always take care of me as a patient and I am sure other pt to.

If you have any further questions you can feel free to follow me on Instagram at actor_brian_uriarte

Thank you

Sincerely
Brian

------------------------------------------

I want to thank Sam for all the excellent customer service and a good experience everytime I come in. She is a very nice, very patient, always wanting to help the patients. She take her time to show patients their proper medications and saving deals. Thank you for the Pen D...<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I’ve been to a few shops in San Bernardino and this shop is my absolute favorite one! The budtenders are so welcoming and friendly, the shelves are always fully stocked, and they have the best quality weed you can find in San Bernardino.
They have great variety of buds to choose from to meet everyone’s needs, not only that but they also have amazing flower deals. EVERY Monday you get an additional 1.5gs on top of any eighth or more on flower! That’s just one of the many great deals that they have here. I’m telling you they got great deals for everything. You like wax? They got you. You like vapes? They got you on that too!
Hope this helps someone make a decision on what shop you want to visit next. You won’t regret it!<//Text>

Went in for my third visit this afternoon & I must say this has to be the most enjoyable experience I’ve had thus far at a 420 dispensary, they have a vast variety of flower from 2 different exotic shelves to budget shelving!!
So on the weeks where you have to manage  your spending they still have quality strains to fit my expenses! The girls here are so lovely and always go in detail with explaining each strain! I’ve had emm whose introduced me to golani prerolls (which I can’t go in and not purchase 😅) to Tiffany who is just the sweetest thing!! She turned me onto G2 250ML edible drinks which will have you on your behind for the remainder of your day! They have an awesome menu which cuts the price of some items in half so you get the best bang for your hard earned bucks!!! Another thing I love is that they have a smoking lounge where I can sit and enjoy my prerolls or dabs!! Thank you MTB staff for your amazing service!!< /Review>

< Review>
Stumbled upon this dispensary while grocery shopping at la Noria & im so thankful that I did!
Mt burnin has some of the best top shelf flower  in SoCal I typically prefer only indica strains but because this shop has such a wide selection for every budget type I’ve began dabbling in hybrids & sativas as well. They have so many exotic strains to choose from like Northern lights, gods gift, sundae driver and so many more!! The girls always tell me about a new product every week!! They have killer text blast deals exclusively for us patients so make sure they have yours!! All the girls have such great attitudes and knowledge I feel like I learn something every visit! Thank you MTB for being THE SPOT!!!<//Review>

< Review>
This is my second time at a dispensary, and I’m so happy I stopped getting my meds delivered and started going to this hidden gem,
I’ve been helped by both EMM and TRIXIE who both are phenomenal!!!!! They explained every product available from exotic flower to mid grade, edibles, CBD products, vapes, disposable vapes, and top brands of wax like exclusive melts to golani!! They even have really great house wax and bomb deals for it like buy 2 grams and you’ll get one free! What more can a wax guy like me ask for?!? They carry a heavy variety of prerolls infused with moonrock to wax and even hash bullets!!! I will be back for your PAD on July 31st for those free samples and goodie bags!!! Thanks MTB staff</Review>
