We just recently had a small event and used Rocio's catering service. The food was great. Rocio was pleasant and professional.  She also catered the event herself...🤯. We will definitely use their services again if needed.< /Text>

<Date>1547868784883</Date><rate>2< /rate><review>I ate here two nights in a row. The first night I got the 4 street tacos combo which came with a kids size drink for $4.99. The tacos were good but there was way too much lettuce or cabbage whatever it was. The next night I got the Papis favorite burrito and it was ok. If I have known they used pinto beans I wouldn’t have got a burrito. And it doesn’t say it comes with lettuce but they sure did put it in there while also forgetting to add the sour cream and guacamole that it says it comes with. As far as the meat it really wasn’t anything special I mean I could hardly tell it was there. Way to kill the craving I had for carne asada, thank you!</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrI_nSjVZW9_vtT6O_ik247tzvOg5WWcKuf-Bp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEgURGbvxj9dThXuPPJ33qNtVqKTjTqpKZEAMN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80952f21cdb90093:0x982625e0b24524e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Fries are awesome, it's legit when they know not to add beans (beans are the bane of my existence). Crisp fries with flavorful meat, salsa and cheese! Definitely will come back. Same with the burrito. Will make it a point to come back. Highly recommend<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>My new favorite Mexican Restaurant. Their drive thru is so convenient. We only just discovered this place 3 weeks ago and we have ordered at least 2x a week. The sopes, elotes, abondigas, caldo de res, tacos are so good but their adobado burritos are my absolute fave.< /Text><response>None<//response>< user_name>

<text>My burrito was huge and the meat itself had a really good flavor... when you could find any of it. There was a tiny amount of asada. Also didn’t get sour cream in my papis burrito and got what I’m pretty sure was a rotten avocado. I won’t be eating here again.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Wait is forever for such a small, not so busy hole-in-the-wall, they run out of certain items that are on the menu, had it happen both times we've gone. Foods pretty decent, 2 stars for the food.<//text>

<review>Rocios catering was a perfect addition to our wedding. We absolutely loved their food and so did our guests. They were very easy to work with and we greatly appreciate all of their communication. They prepared so much food for us during our tasting and provided great costumer service. We cannot thank their team enough for being apart of our day and preparing some of the best tacos we have ever had!< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80952f21cdb90093:0x982625e0b24524e< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The one star goes to the fresh cilantro, cabbage, lemon and the onion I didn't ask for. The veggies were fresh BUT food was not great. The rice was under seasoned or not seasoned at all. The beans tasted as if they had went bad. The asada was over seasoned which I thought, ok, it will make up for the lack of taste of everything else.....but the homemade corn tortillas were not thoroughly cooked, still raw. Which caused my tacos to break while eating them. Should've went back for a refund but didn't have the time. Will not be going back. On the plus, the lady was friendly.<//review>

<text>Pretty good food.  I went through their drive through and ordered for multiple people,  I definitely should have called ahead because I was in line for quite a long time. That's not their fault,  it's a restaurant, you shouldn't expect the same wait times as a fast food place.  The food was okay< /text>< userid>

I've visited Rocio's a few times and I have always been pleasantly impressed, see, when you ask for pineapple fresh water and the lady literally cuts down a pineapple to make your water, that's not only amazing customer service, I dare anyone to tell me where can they get fresher food. Would I recommend Rocio's to anyone, absolutely!!<//Text>

Yesterday was my first time going to rocios drive thru , I wanted to try their food since it has good reviews .  Asada fries were ok , the fries were a little too hard , I also got half a dozen of the tamales . Pork,chicken cheese an jalapeño . The tamales are not that good . The green chicken one doesn’t have chicken inside same with the cheese tamal . The tamales are supposed to be stuffed with a good portion of meat inside not just the dough .<//Text>

<review>Finally a place that has meatball soup worth paying the price for ! Meatballs are COOKED  ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
COMPARE IT TO MOONEY BLVD RESTAURANT EI TARASCCO AND ROCCIOS WINS. OH YA THE PRICE DIFFERENCE GOT THE SAME SIZE SOUP CONTAINER IS ABOUT $3-4 MORE AT EL TABASCO.

Taquitos are great also .<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Text>Taco meat(pork) had hard small bits, not freshly prepared pork. Carne Asada Quesadilla- the meat was also like it was leftover and reheated and hard.  The homemade corn tortillas were fresh and wonderful.  Too bad the rest of the meal was not. Rocios used to be very good, hopefully they will return to their previous standard of delicious, freshly prepared food.< /Text>< gmapID>

<Review>I started going to peace in 2009, I left to attend another church, I knew in my spirit I needed to go back to peace where the teaching isn’t watered down. This is my third Sunday coming back enjoying the pure truth of God and the Holy Scriptures. If you wanna know how to stay saved, be saved please go to peace bishop Swancy isn’t gonna water down the word of God he’s gonna tell you just the way we’re supposed to live if we wanna see and be with the Lord on that great and awesome day.< /Review>< GmapID>

<user>110531726172216937793<//user>< Review>
I attended this church back in the 80's when it was located in Ingelwood and it was the very reason I strayed from God and Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I was very young at the time and had gone through some devastating events. I was seeking comfort in the Lord and was baptized there but was told that if I did not speak in tongues that I would not be recognized by God or as a member of the church, hence when it did not happen I was shunned. Unlike some of you, I was not greeted very warmly and frankly, Pastor's message was not delivered very kind or loving and I believe in the truth and speaking directly from the Holy Bible. Of course I am older and have since been called back to the Lord, have been saved by full water immersion, enrolled in Theology and Seminary School, participate in Missionary work, and have been lead to a beautiful and loving church lead by strong and anointed leaders that work tirelessly to connect people to Jesus Christ, that teach the gospel from the Holy Bible which does not include guilt and shame. This was a young church when I first attended so I hope Pastor has grown in his methods of teaching because again I state it was because of you I was turned off from Christianity. I praise God for leading me back to Christ Jesus and creating in me a grateful and faithful follower.< /Review>

One of the best places to attend, visit or become a member if you desire. Upon my first visit i was welcomed with warm smiles and hand shakes and encouragment to return again and again. What I love most is the encouragment of freedom in the spirit which may not be received in other places. You will not leave the same way you came in.<//text>

<text>This is the place where I really got SAVED according to the New Birth preached by Jesus, and according to Acts 2:38. This place in my opinion is the BEST CHURCH on earth. Pastor Swancy over the years have been a GREAT example of INTEGRITY and what a godly man should be; Pastor Swancy is truly ANOINTED, APPOINTED, & CALLED in these last days the proclaim the word of Salvation and Jesus' reappearing. Most folks pastoring & preaching toady have no anointing and have called themselves to the ministry, this is not the case with pastor Swancy. I would recommend this church to anyone living in Los Angeles whose looking for the real deal where the man of God lives what he preaches. You want real salvation go to Peace Apostolic Church, you will NOT be disappointed.....Happy to call this church forever home!<//text><Resp>None</Resp><date>1542643652496< /date><Pictures>None< /Pictures><GmapID>0x80dd354373b6cf35:0x5c67949b43573397< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Well, the first few online orders went well. But, I am going to give two stars because last weeks order is still haunting me a bit. The amount processed in my account AND is still pending. Which means I am showing two amounts, one that has processed and one that is processing. And, I am still being told to wait a few days. Shouldn’t have to if it is already processed. The processing amount needs to go away. It’s screwing with my account! Once this is fixed, I may give a better rating. As long as this don’t happen again.<//Review>

<text>I loved that store.  I used to find most of my groceries there.  The staff was always kind and very helpful.  So things have changed..  Your store no longer carries my coffee creamer and your bulk burritos have gone to singles like a convenience store, it makes me sad,  I used to be able to buy everything there now I'm gonna be going to Walmart instead.🤨< /text>< Resp>

I needed to by bread since I live close by  Smart & Final it's convenient and the store stays open til 9pm. The store employees are helpful and greet you with a smile, that smile goes a long way.<//Text>

<review>Great place to shop, better prices than a membership u have to pay at Costco down the street, from SMart & Final, great selections & better prices on their  meats, frozen foods, veggies, milk & orange juices, chips, beer, coffee creamers for ur coffee offer a good variety, & holiday items good variety on items.
HRS. are awesome on available Of open for business early to late. Great store, easy parking to park and EXIT.< /review>< date>

<text>I was here with my mother and one of my brothers, back in the 1970's.
We visited one or two nights at 36 Calle Paradora, then the new residence of Ann and Henry Oney.
Henry and others were able to make time to show my brother and I to the vegetable garden area along the north side of the mobile home park, then and there alongside eastbound U.S. Hwy. 101.
It was then and there I learned that there are Jerusalem Artichokes, also known as Sunchokes.
A wonderful, fair root crop, in a small area.
The garden area is now covered with a parking lot, where there is now a religious building establishment.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1614618721012, 'text': 'Thank you for the memories, Robert.'}<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I have lived here for a couple months now, I do enjoy the area but some of the neighbors can be a bit intrusive, and bothersome. And if you are planning on working from home do not live here as it is pretty much impossible to have a good wifi provider/ network. This is due to the area, I wish I would've known this before purchasing especially with the whole COVID restrictions. Other then that the neighborhood is pretty descent.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

The community here is very welcoming and family friendly. From the moment I met the property manager Chris I knew I found my forever home. She always greets my family and I with a warm smile and friendly welcome any time we stop by to ask questions, reserve the clubhouse or pay rent. The office environment is energetic and optimistic every day of the week! The park offers many amenities for its residents including a large club house with a billiard room, exercise facility, full kitchen and living room area. Residents can reserve the clubhouse for birthday parties, family gatherings even wedding receptions! My family and I have attended many gatherings with our church members to celebrate birthdays and baptisms, each time the clubhouse was presented to us fully furnished with many tables and plenty of chairs already set up, which saves so much time and money for us! The bonus for me is the dog park located at the entrance of the park, where my two dogs and I enjoy a good game of fetch every morning! Plus it not only has a bench to rest on after a good run but also a clean up station with complimentary clean up bags and a trash can. If you love Camarillo and want to walk outside to a beautiful view and friendly community every day, Lamplighter Mobile Home Park is the place for you and your family!</Text>< pics>

{'time': 1614727082935, 'text': 'Hi David, Thank you for the information you provided. We are terribly sorry to hear that you had a problem in our park and we endeavor to ensure that all residents keep their pets on a leash when outside their homes so no pets are out running loose. Since we are a neighborhood, there are people that walk through the park, some with their pets that we don’t know and of course there could be dogs that are running through unattended. We do hope that you and your pet were not injured and would hope that you could contact the office to discuss the issue at hand. We pride ourselves in maintaining a nice community and hope this unfortunate event doesn’t prevent you from passing through on your walks.'}</Resp>

<Review>We have lived at Lamplighter for 20 years. I love it here. I have wonderful neighbors. The facilities are well maintained. You can say the rents are high but I could not get an apartment in the area for the amount I pay so I wouldn’t agree.  They do allow us to have pets. It is a nice safe family oriented park. The management is wonderful. They are on top of everything and extremely helpful. I will never move (I hope).< /Review><userid>100884017423370519309<//userid><Response>None</Response>< pics>

<review>I lived for approximately 3 years and I love it. Whenever I've needed something or advice the staff is always helpful. They have several assistance programs. The pool and spa are always clean. They care about the residents, will go out of there way.< /review>< pics>

Decided to move here in part because they said no dogs but the amount of dogs that live and bark in MHC is ridiculous. It is non-stop barking ALL DAY LONG. Management does nothing about it. If you ever work from home DO NOT move here.
Also the parking is a nightmare. Hope you like your street lined with cars.<//Review>

< Review>
Living here a joke. They say there are no dogs allowed but they do not enforce it. There are constantly yapping dogs that go uncheck all day. The neighbors are really nosey. The rent space is ridiculous and you do not get what you "pay for". They dont enforce the street parking so it's very difficult to get out of your driveway even with a back up camera. The homes that are not for sale are filled to the brim with people and they love to throw parties. It's really a shame because I love the location and the house....it is just everyone around you that will drive you insane. Neighbors who tell you there crazy sleep schedule on multiple occasions as if your life revolves around this totally arbitrary person you literally just met. Not to mention you live under a flight path not only for the local airport but also for the navy/army bases running fighter jets between 4 to 12 times a day if not more. Neighbors can be the worst but that goes ten fold for this place. I hope it improves because I really like the house and the location.</Review>

<text>I was invited to swim at the pool by a resident but she stepped away for a minute and in that time I was confronted by the manager, I think it was because I had 5 kids with me, it was a little upsetting that they didn't believe I was a guest but it was worked out in the end. They should pay better attention to the tweakers that live there though 😁</text><date>1538587043006</date><username>NIchole Klocko<//username>< Pictures>

<Date>1536635439053<//Date><Text>I have never seen such  abuse of power and bullying and intimidation from the management in my life. I visited disabled friend there often and her and her caregiver have been arrest and bullied for days and targeted by some old lady named Chris who has a very harsh and mean-spirited personality. Just evil .I happen to know that my friends didn't do anything wrong and she keeps siting them for things that don't exist and she's targeting them so it's basically targeted harassment on a daily basis. when a friend of mine tries to talk to her all she does is yell and his face and I happen to know that most of the people that live there just like her immensely . I mean who picks on a disabled person? In any event I would not suggest moving in there as they have really vicious management but also the rent is way too high.< /Text><Response>None<//Response>< user_id>

You get a private residence ticket, for riding a bike, skateboard, or scooter. For $75.00 increasing someone's rent, or increasing arguments with neighbors, as an Investigator. I find that this is an irrefutable claim. Remind yourself also to not park on the street next to your friends mobile home. Which baffles my mind when I see wrank behavior of a scaming management, fraud, and should I mean illegal ?< /text>

I grew up here. And it's reasonably priced, near Adolfo Camarillo highschool and Rancho Rosal elementary.
Normally people think mobile home park they think old run down and white trash from movies but this one isn't.
If I could buy my own mobile home I would move in myself.< /Review>

Rents are way too high and continues to go up every year. This is why homes are cheap. Very hard to sell your home once you've bought one. High turn over in management too.< /Text>

My usual pizza place. I like the delicious pizzas that they make. You can make your own! And it’s only 10.55. They also added bbq wings that are awesome 😎<//Text>

I have always loved the Pizza Press, the pizzas are so delicious and the staff are very kind and friendly. The aesthetics of the place make it seem like you're in a fancy place and the prepare the pizza in front of you. I definitely recommend.< /review>

<Text>If you're looking to grab a quick bite this place is great! You're able to get a pizza for under $10 just the way you want it. This specific location is great because it is in the middle of a shopping center and everyone in your party has the ability to go to the food destination of their choice</Text>< UserId.>

We've ordered here a few times and each time it has been great!
They make it right in front of you with many fresh ingredients on a fresh thin crust. The really great thing is that you can have your own individual size with your desired ingredients for a reasonable price.
Great quality, great price and great service!
.....and I'm picky.< /review>

Absolutely delicious. The whole family loved it! We ordered via Uber Eats. Good menu options and one of them is to build your own but they don’t sting you for doing this (build your own is same price as the menu pizzas). Highly recommend to anyone.<//text>

WOW! I didn't expect to get such a great pizza!
They use fresh vegetables and all other ingredients, they also have gluten free crust. We love that we could choose which topping to put on the pizza, custom made pizza :)
The stuff was very nice and friendly, the place very clean.
Thank you guys! We will come again<//Text>

My friend was visiting from out of town and he's very particular about his pizza.  The build your own was perfect with garlic, pesto sauce and pineapple all available.  The only unavailable option is for a larger/thicker crust, but they do offer a gluten free.  Arrived to our home hot and delicious!  Just ordered another for delivery.  Maybe we'll make it in to the restaurant one of these days.  This is a great pizza place that uses fresh ingredients and offers a nice variety to choose from.<//review>

He was extremely warm, nice and friendly, and suggesting great cocktails and taking good care of us. I was expecting a boring Monday night, but he made a HUGE difference. If you ever stop by The Pizza Press, ask for his advice on dishes and cocktails, you would be amazed just as I was. Great job! Will see you again soon!</review>< pictures>

I got a pizza that concocted, full of veggies, and I got a chronicle pizza with vegan cheese. It was amazing:) I really like the thin crust and the 12'' size. I felt satiated without feeling stuffed. I'm definitely ordering from here again.< /text>

If you like to build your own pizza, this place is for you. This is one of my favorite's. There are plenty of toppings to choose from and there is no limit to how many of them you can put on your pizza.<//Review>

<review>I love this place. I always go in for the Publish your own Pizza, as I like the custom made ones. I like the options that they have for toppings as well. I have been to a few other places that let you make your own pizza, but this is best according to me. The staff is generally good and attentive too.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
More expensive than Pizza Rev and bad service. Rushing me into making my pizza with no customers waiting.
Was crafting my pizza after a while then the guy tells me last minute when I'm paying and literally starving that they don't accept phone payments apple or such and it was the only way I could pay since my card was cloned the day before. Very disappointing experience plus he was just like whatever pay not empathy for the inconvenience or anything. I should've get the pizza free.  Was forced to use a card I was not supposed to use for need of eating something.  Bad bad.< /Review>

Pizza is super good here! I’d recommend mixing the spice red & white sauce as your base, it has just a kick of spice but definitely worth the switch from a basic marinara. I wish their rewards program reaped better rewards, I’d come here more often if it did.<//Text>

Build your own pizzas; personal size thin crust.  Toppings are always fresh. Atmosphere is casual. Plus they have a decent selection of craft beers on top.<//Review>

<text>My oldest son wants to go here for dinner every year for his birthday dinner and so we do 😁 We went last night to close out his 20th birthday dinner. They are so friendly and accommodating. I'm a New Yorker so I'm picky with pizza! Pizza Press is soooooo delish and we love how the set up is (like Subway's) where you go down a line to personally choose your ingredients!! Fresh veggies and fresh dough! Love this place! We sit in the same place all of the time lol<//text>< Resp>

<Text>When I walked into the Pizza Press, I immediately felt at home. The staff, particularly an employee named Jeremy, was informative and welcoming. I felt excited about my pizza because of his positive attitude. The food is reasonably priced with an excellent selection of craft beers. The restaurant is spotless and the manager is wonderful as well. After I complimented the service and selection, I was given a free cookie. 10/10 will return!< /Text></record>

It's like an east coast bar pie.  So tasty, making a dining out a super fun experience.  Building your own pie from scratch.  I did an everything pie, with half spicy sauce, half garlic cloves added meat balls for a $1.  Combo'ed it with a draft beer for $14bucks.  You can't lose.  Except the beer has to stay inside!  I'd give Pizza Press more than 5 Stars if I could.< /review>

You can put just about anything you want on the pizza for this price and I think that makes this a terrific value.

Sure, you can build them any way you want, but whoever puts the stuff on them is cheap with the toppings. You have to ask multiple times for a little more mushrooms, for example. The bottom is a sorry excuse for crust. More like cardboard with toppings.

I've been to the West Hollywood store several times because of the convenience of the location. The staff doesn't seem to want to be there and it makes me feel the same.

Based on the number of customers I see, I think the place is in trouble.< /Review>< user_id>

<Review>Thinking this place would be a good alternative to Blaze Pizza we came here on opening day for a free pizza and oiled way to many toppings in it. The staff was very nice but the pizza just didn't taste right.

Now we are here for a second time and I just ordered a plain cheese (Press Cheese) and at $6.50 it's a little bit pricier to Blaze at $5.45.

Being a native California I like the California-style pizza crust, but there's something wrong with the crust. It doesn't taste right.  It's a whole wheat crust or something.

Plus with tip and tax the order was over $46 (with two beers) so quite pricey for this little joint.

It's not horrible but Blaze is much better and a new chain called Pizza Rev is a lot better than this place.< /Review><time>1466997345557</time>< user>

The last few times I had been there this particular employee was very friendly - for example, my first time dining there with my fiance this particular employee had a six pack of beer and started a nice conversation with me and we talked about beers we had liked and thus felt really at home and welcome.

One night after a nice glass of wine I decided to take my fiance out for another nice evening at Pizza press.  I was really excited I could have a beer with my pizza at this great place.  I was in line with my fiance waiting, and I saw the employee that I thought kind of as "my buddy".  Once he started helping us out of excitement I explained how much we loved this place and we were going to bring our friends from out of town to come enjoy the ambience and friendly staff. I had explained to this employee helping me that we were going to go somewhere like lThe Olive Garden in Century City but I had a glass of wine and didn't want to drive, so we walked across the street from where I live. Wow I just love how they even serve vegan cheese! Having only one glass of wine I wanted another beer.

When it was time to pay, "my buddy" tells me he isn't going to fulfill my order for a beer.

I smiled, and nodded, but felt so humiliated.

That was the last time I have ever been there.  And when my friends from out of town came to visit we went to Dough, on Sunset.

Just to be fair:

SO STINGY WITH THEIR TOPPINGS! And I asked for crushed pepper to go they only gave me two packets. Toppings didn't look fresh at all. The pizza doesn't taste right. My first and last time.< /Review>

<review>If your like me and love to shop at target, I'm sure your going to be famished. So, pizza press is the place to go, if you a true pizza lover! To be able to create your own pizza for 9.50- 10.40 plus tax. With anything theres like 34 difderent toppings and gouda n feta cheese!! freaking awesome. Employees are awesome the place is nice and clean. My go to spot! And there craft beers! Awesome porters and IPA s come on, what's not to love! Lol music in the back ground too lol</review><Date>1518224338659< /Date><response>None</response><pictures>None<//pictures><Rating>5< /Rating>< username>

I come here often. The majority of the employees are great. Friendly, fast service. Howver, there is one employee who is horrible: Leo. This guy always argues with me about cheese!!?? Dude, Ill pay for the extra cheese lolol. He still argues with me. Im a customer, wth?! Its not just once, but every single time. When I ask him for more cheese, ill pay for it,.. he gets an attitude and he makes an angry face. This time, I almost cursed him out and walked out. I mean, this guy is awful. None of the other employees react this unprofessional way as Leo does. To be honest, Im not going to buy food from here ever again if I see he is working there. Ilk go somewhere else because he is a horrible customer service employee. Its been a very, very long time since Ive been treated this bad by anyone like how he treats me. Today, I just about walked out n left, the service was so bad.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Good pizza ... but the pizza doesn't press !!! 🙈
Poorly leavened so too thin.
Overall good but can't be called pizza

(Original)
Pizza buona...ma la pizza non si pressa!!! 🙈
Lievitata male quindi troppo sottile.
Nel complesso buona ma non si può definire pizza</Review>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) Only place to eat in Los Angeles! We must choose all the ingredients that we want to put in the pizza as much as we want, so we can not put oil and have a pizza that will not be fat! The pizza was excellent with a thin dough, drink at will, the top! In addition the staff is very nice!

(Original)
Seul endroit convenable pour manger à Los Angeles ! Il faut choisir tous les ingrédients que l'on veut mettre dans la pizza autant qu'on veut, donc on peut ne pas mettre d'huile et avoir une pizza qui ne sera pas grasse ! La pizza était excellente avec une pâte fine, boisson à volonté, le top ! En plus le personnel est très agréable !<//Review>

<Review>I don't think I've ever experienced so many unique and delicious flavors all in one spot. The "Night Vision" cocktail caught my EYE and was very good! It was not too carrot-y or gingery as our waiter promised.

AMBIANCE is lovely, with low lighting, small tables, fresh plants and whimsical turnips on their wall. SERVICE was excellent also, from the waiter to the food runners, everyone was friendly and professional.

FOOD was the best part. They gave us some complimentary grilled radishes -- yummy -- who knew? We also had their bok choy dish with pickled veggies, sweet potato app which was delectable, and last but not least, their hand torn pasta - a must try! The pasta was delicate and their peas with cream sauce and herbs created a perfectly balanced dish that didn't leave you feeling weighed down. The plates are good for sharing and 3-4 for 2 people is plenty.

Ah, I almost forgot about dessert. We saved some room for dessert and per the waiter's recommendation, ordered the peanut butter pudding, which was different than I thought and underwhelming for me. Wouldn't order it again.

I would definitely like to try one of their few sister restaurants on the block next time!<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2Nrt1tIZekTpHfVY4H2Rhi2NaCgpzbcceg9ay=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyXWCtYiz1w6-cY43KVHrU9rtdDEIuBawbM3Vo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRlLpn4WgPkw4fuRB2xRdr7nzrY4-nyCLRlUZY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMj3N1mYp_nT9sTbj0Orz2j5WvfKJ1d5ywh1hE2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZZfKYQyBBYu0P7YQJblfdaUVG3QNFe4WDl6y5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< GmapID>

The food was excellent let me just start with that right off the bat the appetizer was so diabolically good I'm thinking about it now and celebrating! Broccoli with lemon and salt slightly roasted flavor, oh my God. The suggestion on beer was fantastic the beer menu was a little daunting as I didn't recognize anything on there whatsoever but at least my waiter had a good recommendation and seemed to know his stuff and so he didn't do me dirty and even though the beer was a little expensive was absolutely delicious. So the food's great the wait staff's awesome very friendly the environment, mental note sitting outside is very very nice looking however try not to have a conversation the sounds of the street are so overwhelming that having a conversation was next to Impossible. It's not the restaurants fault obviously but it is a factor when going to this place and should be taken into consideration aside from that it was clean easy to get into the food was fantastic the wait staff was great and it's downtown so you got to expect some chaos.<//text>

< Review>
Never in my life have I felt immediately addicted to what I was eating, to the point that looking at my empty plate after the last bite gave me momentary withdrawals from the bliss I just experienced. Each dish was extraordinarily impressive, the presentation, flavor, texture, all at the peak of perfection. The drinks, staff, and ambiance complete the experience. Highly recommended, especially for vegetarians. Seriously, I think this is the tastiest food I’ve ever eaten. Pictures will not give it justice.< /Review>

<Review>Really good food! I came here for brunch on a Saturday around noon once and it was totally empty which had me really worried that my investors from New York would be unimpressed and offended that I took them somewhere so unpopular but the food was delicious and the service was great(albeit he was not very busy). I think we were the only table in the whole restaurant so don’t wait in line, go to PYT!< /Review>< rate>

So... You're vegan and your date is a carnivore(your problems are far deeper than looking for a place to eat). Here is your veg friendly choice. I know it's difficult to find places like this, but with PYT, you don't really need to go anywhere else. Make a rezzie, park on the street (unlikely but worth a couple of laps around the block) or in the lot on the other side of Main street,  and enjoy this quaint space.
The bar has crafted drinks and a solid wine selection. The lighting is romantic. The service is courteous and menu savvy.  Speaking of the menu, you really can't go wrong. It's all organic and locally sourced.
A great date joint in the heart of downtown LA.<//review>

Another great one from Centeno.  Small plate plant based cuisine, with a few meat options.  All the flavors are well rounded with a number of innovative items.  Don't be thrown off by all the vegetables, easy to get a hearty and filling meal here.< /Review>

I actually appreciated this cafe, the food is outstanding, plus the restrooms were clean. It was a little fridgity inside, definatly was not perfect. The wait is great. I will most definitely take into consideration going back once more if I ever land the chance. Me and also my buddy got the pizza and also we were not let down. My one suggestion is to maintain the chilly outside. Peace!<//review>

<text>As a vegetarian, I was really excited to eat here. As a server at a very popular farm-to-table restaurant in Chicago, I was looking forward to the service I would receive.

I made a reservation, mentioned my walnut allergy and arrived early.
My friend and I were seated on the patio and Diego took care of us.
I’m not familiar with the restaurant group P.Y.T. operates under, but training obviously isn’t a very important part of operations. Top down management consistently fails in thorough training and it was very obvious.

We ordered the bread with hummus dip, raw sunchokes, blistered green beans, persimmons and the veggie doro wat.
The persimmons lists a hazelnut dukka. The server did not mention walnut oil on the dukka.
I have a walnut allergy and the server wasn’t knowledgeable on menu ingredients. He was able to repeat all menu items but wasn’t aware a specific dish had walnut oil when ordering. The persimmons arrives with the nuts on the side (why?) and I then find out the hazelnuts have a walnut oil on them. As a server who is acutely aware of menu items AND allergy procedures, I immediately felt uncomfortable with the servers lack of knowledge.

After our bread failed to arrive at the table, a woman who must’ve been the floor manager/agm stopped by to apologize and offered us dessert on the house. She suggested a coconut tapioca brûlée. Sounds good...except it has shaved walnuts.

PERFECT. When upper management is poor, their employees performance will also be poor. Lead by example. You’re providing an experience and I am so so SO disappointed in mine.

Three stars because the food was good and the service recovery attempt was there but wasn’t communicated. A host should provide a chit with guest information to the kitchen, server and management.
Good luck.  Thanks for trying to remedy the situation by not paying attention to my allergy and offering me a potential modified dessert.<//text>< Rating>

This is my Saturday brunch place. The food is excellent,  the service is just as good, and  the bartender has become my friend. It's home, only without the inconveniences.</Text>

My mezcal cocktail was superb. I do not typically eat vegetarian and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I would echo the mild criticism that we spent $45ish each and I was still a tiny bit hungry, but we also didn't get the bread or several other options that might have been more filling.</text>< rate>

<Text>The food is very nice - veggie focused and simple dishes that will satisfy most of the people.

The menu is a bit ‘standard’ unfortunately. We struggled to find something inventive and healthy at the time we visited.</Text><time>1508267970049<//time>< Resp>

<Date>1532371826943</Date><rating>5< /rating><Text>PYT is just literally the best restaurant downtown. The menu is inspired, the staff is incredible, and the wine and cocktail menu, mwah! I love that they love vegetables in a non-uppity way. They really seem determined to push the full gorgeousness of veg in ways I think are radical. Get your mind blown by a turnip or a cauliflower, without just going for elevated peasant food! They completely recontextualize turnips, guys.

On several occasions I've brought larger groups and have never once felt that thing that happens where you feel too much, either by staying a long time or needing an extra table. They are genuine and accommodating and lovely. Recently I was able to plan a last minute 11 person birthday party for my sister and it couldn't have gone better.

Anyways, I don't write reviews at all really, but this place is really special. It's a really unique dining experience and the staff are totally down to explain the more unusual things on the menu. I recommend trying as many different things as you can, and the weirder it sounds the more you should definitely go for it.

Great date place too!< /Text>< Pics>

such a cute and quaint little spot. small portions, but the food is quality. Great place to have a quiet/lowkey brunch with friends and family. they have covered patio seating. metered street parking is a bit of a pain, so uber.< /Text>

Cute. Chef Josef Centeno brings us yet another winner. This is a vegetable focused restaurant, not a vegan or vegetarian restaurant (they have options for beef, pork, fish, egg, cheese, etc.). So many vegetable items in their lunch and dinner menus, but not as much in their weekend brunch menu.</Text>

<text>Vegetable forward restaurant that I was really excited to try.  Unfortunately I either ordered the wrong items or just couldn't get behind the food.  Tried a few dishes and nothing blew me away.  The piri-piri flavoring sounded interesting but wasn't anything that I was blown away by.  Table next to us tried the pork jowl meat and instead got a hunk of rare cooked fatty meat, nothing something you should cook medium rare regardless.  Service was great though.<//text><name>Eric Lin<//name>< rating>

Wonderful. I have been a fan of chef Centeno's for a while, so I went to PYT with high expectations,
and I was still impressed and pleasantly surprised. Vegetables in all their power of tastes and textures.
Try as many dishes as you can. The desert was also great.
Will go again.<//review>

I think they were overextended when we went - so despite the friendly service, service was slow.</Text>

(Translated by Google) I chose the place for its good rating and for having several vegan options! The photos don't lie either ... everything my friends and I ordered was very tasty! The only thing that made me sad was that, when I asked for an orange juice, it wasn't freshly made with oranges ... it was industrialized. I think they should reinforce if it is real or industrialized juice.

(Original)
Escolhi o lugar pela boa avaliação e por ter várias opções veganas! As fotos também não mentem... tudo o que eu e os meus amigos pedimos estava muito gostoso! Única coisa que me deixou triste foi que, quando pedi um suco de laranja, não era feito na hora com laranjas... era industrializado. Acho que deveriam reforçar se é suco de verdade ou industrializado.<//Review>

Well, I  normally don't do much reviews. Only when something really good or bad catches my attention.
We have been going to Betos since they first opened and watched it grow. Sadness felt that this place has followed with the rest and worst off, charging $13 for few pieces of pan that tastes bad, compared to not long ago was a decent price and great tasting place.
The quality has gone down the tube/ completely bad, all kinds of flies in the cabinet with the bread, don't have any selection anymore, tasting badly and worse yet, we are in Ceres not Napa. Charging high dollar for flies infestation on bread.  Lastly the hours open are no good lately, cant even have pan with coffee.
Hopefully they can clean it up. Were looking for a new pan shop now.
Very sad sad sad!! 😥</Review>

This is by far the BEST fresh bread EVER!!! We always go get at least 2 bags filled with different kinds of pastries. I highly recommend this place if you like mexican bread.</review>

<review>A little lazy place to open.  El pan is to be ready early morning.
Is delicious, yes it is.  They open a little late for a panaderia.

Beto's Bakery is a fresh, great smelling local bakery

They expanded their store recently and it has more room for so many treats. I am pretty picky about my desserts but they have simple products like donuts, muffins, and spongecake!

5/5 - Great smell, kind employees, and a big selection of baked goods!</Text>

< review>
Their Mexican pastries are the best and most authentic I've tasted. When we're craving sweet bread, we go out of our way to buy from them. Their staff is courteous and they have something for all tastes. My favorite, for the moment, is a sweet vanilla cream filled pastry with a delicate sugar paste on the outside. The bread is soft and airy, well balanced out by the vanilla cream and sugar--it's definitely a treat.</review>

The best Mexican bread in the Valley. There specialty bread is the CONCHAS. Super soft and even if they are a day old they do not harden. Staff is friendly as well.</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Horrible bread. Nothing else they catch a little clientele and they begin to make a bread that everything tastes the same, it tastes like a roll with sugar, a thousand times better than the one that sells the pearl tapatía. Pay attention to your bread please.

Amidst the pouring rain, this was a quaint and comforting place. I had regular coffee and the orange French toast.... Delicious! My aunty has the eggplant sandwich and mint lemonade.... She was impressed and enjoyed both items. And the staff were smiley and helpful</Text>

I was in the area and like always I was hungry, so after a quick search for places to grub I found this place.   The dining area was clean and comfortable as expected.

I Had the chicken katsu bento box which hit the spot.  I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area.</Text>

<Name>Kimberly Perry<//Name><text>My girl ordered the Avocado Toast -_-
My friend ordered the Soy Chorizo & Egg Sandwich
And I had the Regular French Toast + side of 2 eggs

My girl enjoyed her meal except that there was one egg to split between two pieces of toast.. it looked pretty good from where I sat. Had cherry tomatoes, pickled onions, boiled egg and the avocado on top of the toast.
My friend also enjoyed his meal.. he is trying this whole pescatarian, vegetarian thing and just left his clean as clean as a whistle!!!!
As for my french toast.. the reviews here made my experience underwhelming.. If I were to go back for a breakfast.... actually I probably wouldn't.. the only item off the breakfast menu that was remotely pleasing to me would be the french toast, but it just wasn't done right for me.. it was missing some flavor.. butter, cinnamon, sugar it was all missing..</text><Rating>4<//Rating><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dd2f3ab13ec749:0xe6ebd30d28582b33<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I came across this place while looking for a place to dine in on internet. Place had good Yelp reviews so I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.

I ordered spicy pork and fried dumplings. Spicy pork was not too spicy and had great flavor and fried dumplings were so good! Definitely would revisit the place to try a few different dishes.<//text>

So glad to have found this restaurant! Very impressed with my first time here. Ordered the Chicken Katsu bento box, and was not disappointed. A good amount of food for the price, and everything tasted good. Looking forward to coming back and trying other menu items.
Their beer selection looks good too.
*Update* The ramen is also pretty good as well with a healthy amount of noodles, and other mix-ins.<//text>

<text>I come here at least once a week. Food is always fresh and made to order. I always order one of the bento boxes. Never disappointed. Service is great.
I happened to come in on a day when they were testing a new fusion taco recipe.. They were delish! Waiting for the tacos to be added to their permanent menu.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

It kind of makes me sad that I ate here because now I can never eat at flame broiler again. This place is so good I called people in the middle of my meal to tell them how  good it was. All other places are trash compared to this place. Im probably going to ask for a job here to get more food<//text>

It was nice walking into a place where they were willing to start up a conversation with you. Sure in the hell Beats going to some places where they just look at you. Good reasonable priced food.</Review>

I rolled in to Fat Belly grill hungry and wanting a cold beer.  I ordered the Kaarage,  Japanese style friend chicken but with out the bones, and a Sapporo. The karaage was delicious and I gulped it down with spicy mayo and beer yum. I also orders their beef friend rice which has Korean bul Gogi in it which flavored it up. Really pleasing.
I've also been lucky to sample their hopefully soon on the menu tacos. And those, damn...so so so good.  Taco Tuesdays at fat belly I really hope circa January.
I'm going back. Cheers!< /Text>

First time here since Maki Yaki closed and we decided to try Fat Belly Grill for lunch. We odered the chicken teriyaki bowl and the weekly special.
It took 20 minutes to get our food after we ordered. The chicken was room temperature and vegtables were still slightly frozen. The only thing hot was the rice. I received two pieces of "chicken breast" that looked the exact same making me think they use frozen processed chicken.(Look at the picture they have of their chicken teriyaki bento box).  Also when we were leaving two other people who were there before us were asking for their lunch to go since it took so long to get their food they were going to be "late getting back to work." They had only received their Miso soups at that time. I'll also add there was a maximum of 6 people dining in at the time of our visit.

I hate to say it but I'd rather go to Flame Broiler than go back to Fat Belly Grill due to service and food quality.<//text>

Fast service. Called ahead to see if they had the right size snow cables for my car, they answered the phone almost immediately, and quickly told me what I needed to know. When I stopped in to pick up the cables service was fast and efficient.</review>

<review>Bought a new part from a different store but I couldn't get a sensor out of the old one. Though they could not find the right part I was just going to order brand new, they took time out of their day to break the nut loose out of the old part I broke, saved me 35 dollars and a lot of headache trying to get that sensor free.< /review><Gmap_id>0x809a46341d663f75:0x47ba8bc0f8837f66<//Gmap_id><user_id>110451977153422319018</user_id>< pics>

<Review>As a small shop owner, I rely on the local parts vendors for timely and accurate parts ordering, cross referencing and delivery. The staff at this particular Orielly auto parts has far surpassed any vendor i have delt with in my 17 years in the profession. If they dont have it, they will get it in a timeframe tha fits your needs. The biggest advantage of having a group of highly trained parts professionals at my disposal is that they understand the difference 10 minutes can make in the sale of a service depending on parts avalibilty and they always hual A$$ to deliver my parts and keep my business thriving. Good folks at the Pollock Orielly.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I bought a car battery just over a year ago so it was warrantied but would no longer hold a charge. I told them that i left the battery on a trickle charger for two days and that it even stated "bad battery", and i also tried jumping it but obviously wouldnt work. Instead of giving me a new battery so i can get on with my day they made me wait over an hour and a half (1- 45 min session, 1- 50 min session) only to tell me that i had a bad battery. Yeah. I know. I told you that multiple times. F'n ridiculous.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
I have to say that not only is the management is wonderful, BUT SO IS THE STAFF!!!!!  I have met Robert outside O'Rielly... and he was always professional and friendly...I have also visited this location recently with various car problems.  No matter who was working any day, they all upheld a high level of professionalism and integrity.  I was especially impressed when I brought in a power steering pump housing completely unassembled, and a worker there helped me walk through the pump disassembly , reassembly and other important info.... I was blown away!!! These people really care about you and want your business! They will go the extra mile, and then some to get your car working at it's best!  As a automobile novice, I salute these folks!  No body wants car problems, BUT EVERYBODY wants someone with affordable and knowledgeable answers!</Review>

You walk in with a purchase in mind and instantly you realize what a really nice store this is.  I stopped in for some fuel cleaner and although I didn't really need anything else I found myself walking the aisle just to check out the store.  It is very clean and organized and just very well managed.   I was very impressed with the staff and store!<//Text>

The visit was good even though I went in there to get freon to put in my AC because I thought it was running low and the young man put the freon in but he overcharged it so it stopped working so he said maybe there's a leak so I went back home and then I went back up there and they sent me over to O'Reilly to get some dye to put into the AC unit to see if there was a leak and O'Reilly told me to go back to AutoZone to see if they had overcharged the unit and when I went back in there they put the same device on the AC unit and seen that it was all the way over in the red and that it was overcharged so he let the freon out and I just seen my money flying in the wind LOL and he got it in the green and yellow section and the AC start working again</Review>

Anchored by a large Safeway. Convenient to I680 at Santa Rita. Layout of store fits Safeway's overall pattern. Convenient rest room location. Deli serves individual servings allowing the locals to grab a quick bite. Produce and meat section all look fresh. Flower section done in a good selection of color.</review>

We like Amici's Pizza & Italian Food here. The crust is thin and perfect. Caesar Salad with complimentary anchovies is excellent. A cup of vegetable minestrone soup is great.<//review>

A decent housing/shopping plaza anchored by Safeway.   Has a number of decent restaurants like Amicis pizza, Coco Cabana, Blush yogurt, a sushi place plus some quick places like Pete's coffee, Baja Fresh.  Also some services like hair cuts, shipping, Salon.  Parking is never full.< /Review>

The infrastructure if the lot is inadequate and poorly designed. It's inconvenient to get in and out of the lot. The plants and buildings seem well maintained. It's just not spectacular or competitive with more upscale or modern shopping centers.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Waterford Shopping Center has a great mix of businesses.

Anchored by Safeway and Wells Fargo a few of my favorite shops here are Armadillo Willy’s, Bagel Street Cafe, PostalAnnex, and Peet’s Coffee.

This center also has salons, dental offices, a martial arts studio, AAA, Unleashed by Petco, and GNC to name a few more.

This parking lot can be a mess at times but still my go to shopping center.< /Review>< pictures>

I liked the area but parking could be an issue depending on time of day since there are lots of different store in the area including Blush frozen yogurt, Armadillo Willys,  Safeway, Amicis, etc. But I liked the convenient of the plaza - I can shop grocery after I eat 👍</text>

<Review>Their is no Tesla nor Bolt or EV stations anywhere, not even underground parking at all.
A lot is here, 1st of all a newer great Safeway with O Organics, mom to mom and other great brands including most international foods. Could do better than just basmati rice for Indian food. A lot off guarenteed Produce including unusual fruits. Cold waters and some single beers and small batch brewers.  Peets' coffee a dentist a pet store where you can wash you small or large doggie. Or cat!

Two hair cutters for guys including great clips.
Salon including tanning(?). Not safe for folks did eptable to u v rays overexposure according to the FDA AND the National Safety Council and IHHS. Karate school, BBQ. Sushi, organic yogurt(frozen), Asian specialty and several dentists and even a massage place that is not shady. Expensive membership though, in most opinionated.  Banks, apartment community that was built by Shea over  decade ago almost two.
It is truly an integral part of the shopped and across from a mediterrian and Mexican style cafe and optometrist.  Some qualitative and some quantitative items/businesses. Here is a lot of one stop shopping and a large city water park and city park behind in Emerald Glen.
If living or coming from Tracy worth a stop. Miles from fuel stop though. Across freeway is a it's and a Shell. Waterford is busy even with an CSAA/AAA branch office too. Decent place.<//Review>< username>

I'm not giving this a 5-star review until a real Café comes in with tea and coffee and farm-to-fork sandwiches & soups and a bakery and Wi-Fi and random music and loaner books spread about and, just, overall character. For additional reference, check out Blackbird Café in Valparaiso, IN. Local proprietor. No chain. Total soul.</review>

<Review>Went here to buy a sandwich. Asked for the meal deal: free soda. The card machine could not scan my Safeway card. All the person behind counter could say was, Sorry no deal for you today.</Review>< Pics>

Long lines, not enough checkers or baggers.  Often times there is no quick check line open and not all purchases can be taken through the automated machines.<//text>
