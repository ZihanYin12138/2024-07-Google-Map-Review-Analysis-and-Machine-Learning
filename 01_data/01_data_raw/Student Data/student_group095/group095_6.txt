I highly recommend the Bagelry- I stopped here to buy a dozen bagels for a work staff meeting and had such a pleasant experience. I was in a hurry and not having called in my order I did not expect it to be that fast, but it was! Very reasonable price and delicious fresh bagels -my team loved them. Thank you for your fantastic customer service! It is so refreshing to see someone genuinely care and I hope your business thrives!</review>

First thing to note right now is that they're thankfully still open and running business as usual, however they're just not offering in-house dining just yet. You can order over the phone or walk in for takeout.

The bagels all look heavenly, along with their fresh juices, homemade cream cheese spreads, teas and vietnamese coffees. We ordered 2 sandwiches from their list of most popular options. Lox was my go-to of course and it absolutely didn't disappoint. The number of capers on it was a bit of overkill in my opinion, but it was great nonetheless. My fiance ordered the turkey, bacon, cheese and tomato on a jalapeno bagel. I had to have a bite because I can't turn my head from all things jalapeno. So so good!

We wanted some souvenirs to-go, so we obviously ordered half a dozen bagels, specialty cream cheese, and a vietnamese coffee for the road. This consisted of 3 gourmet bagels, hawaiian, sundried tomato, and spinach parmesan bagels paired with an 8 oz. container of homemade garlic herb cream cheese spread.

I actually dropped my vietnamese coffee on the floor on the way out because I'm a huge klutz and went to clean it up but the lovely employees (I'm thinking the owner is the one who actually was interacting with us-- VERY friendly man) said to not worry about it. He mopped it up and poured me a fresh iced vietnamese coffee which I was very thankful for. Great hospitality and a kind attitude goes a very long way in the food industry. If your personality is beautiful and contagious, then that's a reason to come back in itself.

All in all... The bagels were delicious. Homemade cream cheese is AMAZING. Vietnamese coffee is strong how I like it and I'm going to be hyped for the next couple of hours because of it, LOL. Pricing is just right. They're in a prime location right off a main street and I hope they're here for a long time! Happy belated 1 year, The Bagelry!</Text>

A fantastic little local spot for fresh bagels, bagel sandwiches, and the usual assorted bits that go along like smoothies, coffee drinks, of course lox and cream cheese. Great food and nice people make for a great experience.<//text>

I got here around 9:30 and most of the bagels were already out, goes to show how good they are. The Nova bagel is absolutely amazing, the ingredients were amazingly fresh and delicious. Best bagel I've ever had. Fresh squeezed orange juice was good too.< /Review>

The bagels were alright. Just alright. Big, size which is cool, filling. However, the flavor left a lot to be desired. We ordered a variety of sweet and savory but they all were rather plain tasting. Particularly, the cinnamon raisin bagels barely tasted of cinnamon. All of them had a garlicky taste, as if the slicer or toaster had not been cleaned from the previous bagel. Overall, it was okay. Would we go back? Probably not.</review>

and luckily I did because they have more then just bagels! I had the Nova bagel which is lox, cream cheese, red onion,  tomato, capers and I LOVED it! Can't wait to try their sandwiches. Oh yeah the owner is super nice too. I definitely recommend this place for breakfast and will try it for lunch my next trip.<//Text>< Date>

We really enjoyed our food here! The bagels were fresh and flavorful (I had "the works" which was an everything bagel). The staff was friendly, the whole place was clean, and everyone wore their masks. It was a good experience!<//Review>

The owner gave us a lovely walk-through of the menu, which was a nice personal touch. My Nova Classic came open faced, and that's not necessarily my preference, but the components were excellent. Make sure to ask for your bagel toasted if you order it with cream cheese, it isn't standard. The eggs in the breakfast sammies come out at about a million degrees, so be careful! The milk tea with boba was solid.< /review>

<Review>I'm not sure what it is they do besides take complaints for the board members.  I don't even know who my members are or when meetings are or have an opportunity to vote. The software and apps used have never worked correctly for me as well as other neighbors I have talked to. It would be nice to know whats going on< /Review><date>1620865782218< /date><pics>None</pics>< gmapID>

<review>Jaeschke manages the HOA for the neighborhood I live in. I had a, what I thought, a pretty straight forward question about who is liable for the damage to the exterior fence wall. The person on the phone asked if I could send an email with pictures to Mariana Chen, which I did.

After one reminder, she responded that she had to consult a manager, John Abello. A few weeks later, I still didn't get an answer, and after two additional reminders, Ms Chen responded that it was still under review of the manager and the Board.

At the time of writing this review, it has been nine (!) weeks since my initial question. I've sent several new reminders, including copying their customer service department, but no response whatsoever.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< name>

<Review>So hard to get anyone to respond to your email. Being in  a HOA that is older you need a smart well experienced manager. Our first manager you could tell was just over the job. The second one we had was very green and left the company after about a year. The Third was good but was overloaded with properties making her work quality poor.
So I would not recommend this company look elsewhere. I could say so much more but honestly this company has already wasted so much of my time don’t let them waste yours.</Review><Date>1616117573662</Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dc0755f20d0c7d:0xeee6b31d68da9e5e< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

< Review>
Poor quality: poor customer service, not helpful

Poor value: no follow through with action

Not professional: workers using personal life as an excuse to not help with maintenance requests

Not Responsive: Response time is not reasonable. I have been waiting for 9 months to get my issues resolved. They include rat and termite extermination, buying gate fob keys, and water damage on the roof

Cheryl Leonard is difficult to reach through TownSq, phone and email.< /Review>

It is really awesome to see Argie Breden  respond and get the job done so efficiently!  Argie understands the project and takes action.  Our kids really needed a place to play outside so we requested a pergola to be installed.  The EBS school is also encouraging small group participation at home.  So Argie recognized the significance of the project and got it through approval process and provided good inputs. Go Argie!< /Review>

<Review>Ugh. Just forget about them. Maybe they're just cheaper? Doesn't matter. Not worth it.
I've emailed them about serious emergent issues, absolutely zero response. They keep sending my HOA checks to Texas, then back to me, saying they're not our property management company anymore. Turns out they mistook Pacific Isle for Pacific Ridge.. understandable, except this has happened multiple times!  In theory, paying HOA dues online is possible, but they can't seem to explain how it's done. It's a mystery. They use this janky 'Town Square' web app that does nothing useful.< /Review><Response>{'time': 1616187247737, 'text': "Hello Roy, we're very sorry to hear that you're disappointed with the service that you've received thus far.

<date>1617135953572</date><Review>Ever since Associa NN Jaeschke began managing The Trails of Rancho Bernardo HOA, the value of the homes in the community de-valued due to poor management (enforcement) of the architectural committee, poorly laid concrete streets, lack of communication with homeowners, etc.  After I moved out of the community, I paid $250 into escrow to transfer their HOA to the new owner - waste of money.  I still get emails from them.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Molly Johnson provided OUTSTANDING customer service to resolve a billing issue I had due to an error that Associa made, which created the problem for me in the first place. No one else I reached out to at Associa/NN Jaeschke over a few weeks responded or seemed interested in even getting back to my voicemail calls or emails. I became quite frustrated until I talked to Molly. She patiently listened to me and immediately went to work to solve my problem. She provides excellent support.< /text>

My hoa recently got this company for managament and they are extremely slow in fixing the violations especially the noise one which are the worse. I give them all the evidence and information they need but most of the times my reports are either ignored or adressed in 3 months but no action is taken. I would sell my property and cut my loses if it wasnt for my financial situation.< /Text>

<Review>Need a replacement pool fob. Emailed NNJ in mid-July. Got a pretty quick response saying to send a check for $25. Sent that check in. Got a *gate clicker* in the mail. Check was cashed on 8/3. Numerous calls and emails, summer is almost over, and I just want to get into the pool without pestering my neighbors. Over two months in, and I don't even know what's going on, because Tiana has ghosted me...<//Review>< Pics>

Our HOA at Mission Trails Villas is managed through NNJ, specifically by Jenna M. and she is truly wonderful to work with. Jenna effectively  keeps our agenda items organized, updating us as changes occur. She is very professional and responds to homeowners in a timely manner. I would absolutely recommend her as a property manager<//Review>

<review>We have had the misfortune of having N.N.Jaeschke as a property manager for our Metrome condominium.  Overall they are inefficient, disorganized, and do not communicate at all with their clients.  The icing on the cake was a bill for $535.41 that no one could tell me what it was for.  I am not delinquent on my payments, and even paid a "special assessment" for their mismanagement of building maintenance funds.  My only hope is that the Metrome HOA association will reassess their association with this company, and shop for a more reliable, and client friendly property management company<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Horrible property management company.  Have requested assistance with our HOA multiple times over six months ago to clean up a weeded, dirty infested area in our neighborhood with no action and broken promises.  Will do the clean up ourselves.  Don’t use this company for management unless you want unhappy customers.<//review>

Unfortunately, I am renting through a company that has to go through this company to get anything done for my residence. My wife and I simply need approval to park our cars outside of our residence. Something that would take any normal company a day to do. Or, better yet, done upon recieving keys to the property. We've had this property for 3 months now, and are still unable to park our cars outside of our own home. I have tried contacting Gina directly and have recieved no communication back. My Property manager has an email trail of non responses for weeks... this should be basic stuff for any property manager. Very lack luster service.

Typical of a bloated corporation; eager to structure their businesses under one brand. In their infinite thirst for profits and prestige, they buy out small service providers and absorb their client base and reputation. In the process, they lose the one thing that made the individual businesses successful in the first place: Human relations. Ambitious Associa stakeholders have no interest in local communities, no desire to make a positive difference in the lives of their customers or employees. Their goal is to reach profit targets and increase shareholder value (corporate lingo is repugnant, isn't it?) Wall Street messiahs. ✡$✡< /text>

I am of the firm belief that being a property manager is a tough thing to do, it takes a lot of your time and patience out of the day and the more properties you have the more interactions you have with homeowners, there is no 24/7 manager that could possibly complete all things that a homeowner would request or want so eventually you may find a complaint or something to complain about. I have being working with NNJ managers for over 20 years now and there has been new faces and old faces through the years working to make a difference in the communities they serve. I know they are hard workers and are trying to make the difference for you. I have been working recently with Gina Falcon-Heneghan, Cheryl Leonard, Bobbie Gibbs, Danika Vogel and several others and have had great experience with all of them. If you need a property management company these guys can help you out.</review>

<Text>It's a great little Target chock filled with the essentials and shine goodies.  It's not a full size Target store but they maximize the space by sticking it with a great assortment of items.  The staff was friendly and the store is well organized.

Space is limited which means items are limited which also means you won’t buy unnecessary items like an average Target trip. A bonus for me.< /Text>

A regular target with food and basic day to day supplies. The lines can be pretty long (around 5 minute wait to checkout), but it is not that bad if you have the time. The times I was there, it felt overly crowded and the isles were a little small in my opinion.< /Text>

Having this place downtown next to the BART Station is a Godsend. Great to be able to pick up some basics real quick while you're downtown. But, the line can get really long.<//text>

<Review>The store is small and the selection of items sometimes is not great, the place is very convenient, the prices are good, especially when using Target Red card, and the quality of their store brand items, especially for groceries is great.  The only drawback I have found since the store opened a couple of years ago is that due to its size the selection of items, especially non-grocery items is very limited.</Review>< rate>

I loved them until this employee ruined my visit ASSUMING I was stealing those nasty sandwiches!! I went in to look for something to munch on and I had a sandwich in my hand it was gross no cheese so I wasn't getting it my purse was falling so I fixed it and had the product in my hand still and I can feel someone just watching and it's an employee and I felt disrespected because I'm black and all eyes on me like I'm stealing. That's really offensive to me because not everyone with colored skin steals if I wanted the sandwich I would have paid for it and went about my day and if he wasn't so guilty about feeling like I'm a thief then instead of arguing he could have just said sorry ma'am I didn't mean to make you feel that way. People that know me know I'm a sweetheart and it's sad when people put you in a category because of your color. I seen walk past others without double taking but he had his eye on me and tried to slick like I can't feel being watched...< /review>

<review>Oh look a Target Express, let's go have a dander what's inside! Oh it's just like a CVS with Target slapped across on it except the Target prices!

This place is really small and catered almost exclusively for your average student with apparently a lot of money.  Just the normal clothes, food, hygiene, and a few electronics. The thing that really sucks is that their electronics shelf is empty but of course never fear because they have the new apple items!

Not that great of a place honestly if you really need to go get more items than your usual toiletry, go to a different target or store.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Wow! It's amazing how much stuff they can cram into a mini-target. Everything from sportswear to candles to spaghetti sauce to iPhones. Cashier was using two stations to check people out, which confused customers because it seemed less efficient. When I wasn't asked if I wanted a bag, I requested one, and then was told that will need to pay 10¢ for one next time. Maybe cashiers are a little overworked and spread thin?< /Review>

<text>I've had the absolute worse experience at this store compared to all other Target locations in the Bay area. First of all if you want something that's locked up (like a phone) you have to literally walk through the store and find someone to help you. Don't try asking up front because they will say "we'll send somebody back there" and then 30 minutes later nobody has shown up. You might have to ask every employee in the store 3 times before somebody even bothers to grab the keys to unlock the electronics. Every other Target I've been to has at LEAST one person deticated to just the electronics department.
Okay now on to the next issue. Returns, you can't return anything at this store that hasn't been purchased here. So usually if I buy an item from Bay Fair Target I can return it to any other one, I.e. San Francisco or the Target on University Ave in Berkeley. But this Target claims to be a "express store" (it certainly isn't living up to its name because I shouldn't have to wait for 30 minutes to get something unlocked).
Now usually prepaid phones can be returned for a full refund for any Target as long as you have the receipt and (depending on location) ID. Well I bought a prepaid phone (never activated it) opened it(never before had an issue returning opened prepaid phones at any Target except this one). Then when it was a almost unusable device I figured Id just returned it, same day, manufacturer defect not my fault at all. Then they said oh "no refunds on prepaid phones" I had a receipt with the date saying return by and it was dated for April 20. They refused to refund it. In the end I had to go around and get it refunded at the Target on University Ave. They made an exception because normally they are not supposed to because of it being bought at a Target express location.
All in all its been a very terrible experience at this location on multiple occasions. The people even questioned why I bought the phone in cash. If I want to buy a 20 dollar phone with a 20 dollar bill I'm perfectly entitled to. It's a free country and the 20 dollar bill is legal tender the last time I checked.
They treat everyone like some criminal for not using a card. (What if my card isn't working huh, what if I'm waiting for a replacement because it got demagnetized). The rude looks I got are not just because I paid cash but also because I had to find an employee to open the electronics cabinet and after waiting 30 minutes I walked through the store asking all the employees. Well if I didn't I'd probably still be waiting there right now 30 hours later. They lucky I wrote this review a day later after thinking it through because I have some choice words I really want to add right now.
All in all don't shop here. Save yourself the trouble and go 1/2 a mile to the Target on University Ave. The people there are actually helpful and ask if they can help you find stuff. Oh and there's always someone at electronics department<//text>< Pics>

When most people think of a Target store, they think of a big box with tons of stuff.  This one is really more like a convenience store - what I'd expect from a Walgreen's.<//Review>

Nice to have an alternative to the Walgreens across the street, which has checkout lines that make the TSA lines at SFO look short!

The checkout lines here are better than at the Walgreens, and the selection of merchandise is a bit better... but nowhere near as good as a full-sized Target.< /Review>

Its super small, this is a Target Express, so while they do have a little of everything, if you are looking for something specific at a target this may not be the one for you, as this only holds the essentials.< /review>

Small but serviceable. If you're looking for something specific or from the extended selection, you're less likely to find it here, but if you're after sporting clothes or general things, this place will be a good start in a pinch.< /Review>

When I lived in Berkeley roughly a decade ago, this used to be a Walgreens (or CVS) and I came here pretty frequently.  Funny to see it as a Target Express - basically a slimmed down Target with slightly better selection and prices than a CVS or Walgreens.  Very clean, orderly store, though I found the security guard at the entrance a bit creepy - he was continually staring at people in the store, as if he was waiting for people to shoplift so he could bust them!<//review>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>I asked for a medium fade and got a Mohawk looking hair cut and strands of hair not cut by my ear. No joke. One side looked faded and at work they asked who cut my hair, I said the barber, no specifications. Guess it’s a one time mistake. Price was right but still I want a consistent haircut. Next time I come in, I want a better quality job.< /Review><UserId.>113222855466094463033<//UserId.>< resp>

<text>Overall Impression is OUTSTANDING!

QUALITY CUTS lives up to its name!

Occasionally, I get a haircut from Lisa and, as always, greatly satisfied with the Excellent Customer Service and affordable, Quality HairCuts.

Eye Candy: Lots of Decor and Design that I find pleasing to the Eyes...If I had a Man-Cave, I would hire her to decorate it...lol

There are some display items/pieces that are a great "Conversation Starter"

If given the choice to choose only one Hair Stylist/Barber Shop, I would definitely   pick QUALITY CUTS for its Affordable price, Excellent Customer Service, Cleanliness, and Great Overall Experience 👍 👌 👏 😀

I Haven't been back since the height of Pandemic but, thankfully, Hair Salons/Barber Shop are finally open again.

Love this place, all of Barbers in here are outstanding. Lisa made my wife change barbers for our 5 boys because she did so great on their hair the first time. We took them to the chop shop in Lancaster before. Ju and Young do a really good job as well with military cuts. Hot towels being used after every cut, Young does a 1 minute shoulder massage after the haircut that literally feels great. Great place to go to.</Text>

<review>They said I didnt have to sign in and I would be next.  Then the Asian woman took someone before me saying that she only used her clippers and didnt give shampoos.
She had a license, I don't get it. Just lazy I guess. Was it because I was disabled, a Woman, or White!<//review>< Pics>

This was our first time here. They have Amazing customer service! My son is very nervous when is comes to cutting his hair because many times they have messed it up. The ladies talked to him about what he wanted every step of the way and he was very happy. We will be going back. Highly recommend Quality Cuts to everyone!</Text>

My great nephew needed a haircut. We're babysitting him over the weekend so that my nephew and niece can take a break. My niece is particular on how she wants the cut. Did a SUPERB job! He received a lollipop and a toy. Thank you for really keeping to my niece's preference via her text message❣<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>We just visited Quality Cuts for the first time. First impression walking in the door was great, we were greeted warmly by the owner Lisa and she let us know she would be with us shortly (she was with another customer). We were there for a haircut for my son, and she was gentle with him and put him at ease (he's usually good with getting his haircut, just really shy). She took her time, did exactly what we wanted, and we loved the way his cut came out. She offered us free water or soda and of course he got a lollipop at the end. She was a really down to earth person and her salon is clean and decorated nicely. We will definitely be going back!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I highly suggest avoiding this gym at ALL costs. Not like it matters because it doesn't seem like they are ever reopening. I moved last June due to military orders. This gym owes me money and you can't get in touch with anyone. I had to call my bank and have them put a stop payment on them because they continued to charge me even after I canceled. They owe my friend several hundred dollars as well. The lack of communication they've given current members, even staff is outrageous. Most unprofessional gym I've ever been to.< /text>

<text>This gym is really poor on communication they owe people so much money as well as they do to me. It’s been half a year. I can’t believe how a gym can take advantage of so many people without feeling guilty or giving people their money back. I saw a review on how the gym wasn’t giving people their money back just so they don’t go bankrupt is absolutely hysterical. This gym is the worst. People work for their money and may even struggle to get the amount of money they have taken. The fact that the gym was closed and people couldn’t workout and make the money worth is absolutely unprofessional.</text>< userid>

I personally love this place, I've been coming here for about 6months now and sure they are much older than most gyms but they recently got new weights and equipment with more changes to come! The place is pretty clean as well and the staff and members are always friendly. What I believe separates this gym from others is, that dog house vibe it has too it if you know what i mean? Other places have strict policies and limitations (too sophisticated); here you can grunt, mentor one another, and motivate yourselves, other newer gyms prohibit such behaviors for they "discourage" others which defeats the whole gym club idea and feels more like a babysitting club lol. Anyways give this gym a try if your a first timer or seasoned athlete.💪< /Review>

<userid>110696922463776396784</userid><pics>None< /pics><Text>It has gotten better. For the longest time the pads would rip up and they would take forever to replace it. So the spongey padding would be exposed and get saturated in people's sweat and hair product. The worst smells ever. Randomly too, not just the old busted pads. Like certain areas on the rubber mats or some weights even. And instead of addressing those health affecting items, they would rather take months for a simple remodel, removing all the wall mirrors and replacing them with smaller mirrors. Making the gym look much smaller than before now.
I would like to get in the pool but not there, ever. I remember it was closed for the longest time too. Men's bathroom actually rarely smells bad and is decently clean 99 percent of the time. I know that takes effort and that is a big pet peeve for most.< /Text><time>1564034747557<//time>< Gmap_id>

BE CAREFUL. This company has issues with keeping their word. I was signed up for a year long contract even though the agreement I signed did not state it was a 12 month agreement.

Laura Villa is great. Although I moved and unfortunately can not be at this gym anymore she was still very courteous and professional when helping me close my membership. I will be referring friends and family who still live in this area to sign up with this gym. Thanks Laura!< /Review>

<username>Gabriel Dominguez<//username><Text>The equipment is old, they lack dumbbells, actually they're always missing many weights. It's a cool environment, affordable compared to other gyms and that's where my 4 stars come in. The front desk isn't always the most welcoming. The have a juice bar in there which is nice if you want a smoothie (healthy smoothie) after a workout. I like that they have an exterior workout area, sort of feels like muscle beach cause they have it next to the pool but for sure, they need to update they're equipment because, only for the price, I offer 4 stars.< /Text><time>1557371290951<//time></record>

<Review>Bathrooms always dirty, most equipment is old, dirty and broken, always crowded and hard to find available equipment, poorly trained staff only looking to upsell your membership or sell new memberships, hard to find any parking since lot is always full, cant use boxing room while classes are in session, equipment taken out for "exclusive" workout area that requires additional monthly payment. It has been consistently like this for over 10 years even when they change names or get new management. Always get the same excuse that they are working to improve services, but never do.< /Review><date>1568731773735< /date></record>

Alright gym for the price, it can be very crowded during peak hours.

Gym has gotten a little better since renovations as torn up mats were replaced and a few more machines but stretching area was completely removed and replaced with a single mat for everyone who doesn't have access to the group training area.

Still good for the price but you may have to wait for a machine a while if you come during peak hours, and parking can also be a bother during those times .plus everyone says cancelling is a pain in the butt so keep that in mind.<//Review>

First things first the gym ain't perfect but what gym ever is..I'll admit it's a little rough around the edges but you cant beat the atmosphere this gym provides unless you're one of those picky people who think every huge guy in a tank is a douche. The staff are always nice and if your a local then it's a chill environment it's also a great place to meet new people or even meet up with friends. This is a gym for  grinders and people who wish to workout without any rules or limits if you want a gym that's pretty, nice, and sounds like a library then you better stay at planet fitness.< /review>

<review>I joined the gym and continue to stay primarily because of the classes they offer. I do use the weight machines and sauna. This is where I have a problem. When the equipment breaks, it stays broken for extended time. Half of the cable machines are missing parts or not operating all together.  The men's sauna has been broken going on two weeks. The management is pretty much non responsive to complaints. They focus on window dressing and campaigns to add more members but not on maintaining their equipment in working order..<//review><UserId.>105239125106133349839</UserId.><Pics>None< /Pics><Time>1553689174552<//Time><Rate>1</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<name>Tim Hardison<//name><text>Signed up online in order to swim but later found out their pool wasn’t heated during the winter. Tried to cancel my membership for the next month and they told me I was locked into a 12-month contract. Nowhere during the online enrollment did it mention I was signing up for a year long contract. In fact, the very first section of the terms and conditions is “Month to Month Agreement.” Spoke with the general manager and she said she needs to email someone about this but it has been over a week and no word yet. I’ve read through the agreement and gone through the online enrollment process over a hundred times already.... wonder what’s taking so long...

UPDATE: Upon writing this review, the manager reached out and stated to me they  canceled my membership as I requested. A month later I am still being charged...<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Gym needs Alot of work.. Equipment has been broken for months.. Which include, showers.. Hot water has been off over a week.. Hot box as well.. It seems like managed is only concerned with making sure your monthly dues are on time, then fixing the problems in the gym.. The enhancement fees from my understanding are to keep the gym running smoothly.. But that is not the case.. I will admit the original owner of Golds, wasn't exactly the nicest person to be around, but he definitely made sure his Gym was up and running.. If something was broken or run down, it was taken care of b4 the week was out.. Not so much with the management you have at the moment.. losing the theater and power cage was definitely a disappointed.. I understand Zumba and Spin are the thing for the moment.. But lets not forget about the other members who enjoy other things.. The very big cage is a waste of space.. So much equipment could take its place.. The front desk and maintenance workers are very friendly ( at least to me ) in a professional way.. But some clients do have a problem with woman going in men's locker room while they are trying to change.. Not the maintenance fault.. It is management.. Schedule a male as well as a woman at the same time.. The new Golds is coming sooner than later and I do know, if World's does not get going with the complaints, u are going to lose Alot of buisness.. Hope fully that should concern you, instead of thinking, not a problem.. I have been a member when we were in back of Costco.. I enjoy the gym.. but until changes are made, I would not recommend people to sign.. Because the vibes I get is, if you don't like the way things are, u can leave..A real issue I'm having is with Worlds trying to send my bill to collections.. I was out of the gym, almost a yr, because of health issues.. I received a call from collections telling me I was behind on payment.. Which I knew nothing about.. According to the front desk.. and management, they knew nothing about it as well.. So once again, lots of problems to fix with the gym.. I keep hearing changes are coming, and that is all we have been hearing.. Hear say...( 9/ 27 / 19...I like Alot of customers or client, do not want to hear about understanding the frustrating of how we feel.. We would much rather see results.. ( Meaning changes for the better )... Worlds should not need to hear about complaints on equipment... In closing, it should not take a new Golds gym to open as well, to get things going.. Which I see is starting to happen..)< /review>

You're temporarily closed.
Why are you charging me the recurring payment?
Why are you charging me the club fees?
These fees need to be pushed back until you reopen
$35 charge in the month of April.
This seriously can't be your business model.?< /review>

<text>Good gym to start out at to see if you are serious about going due to the cheap price, but nothing more.

(UPDATE)
Despite my earlier negative review, I have been going here for a few years and I have decided to change my review to 5 stars. They have made efforts to improve and continue to do so, and also, this pandemic has brought out everyone's true colors and I am extremely proud to say that the gym I go to takes the pandemic seriously, unlike certain other gyms in the area that refuse to close and refuse to require the wearing of masks due to never having actually read the US Constitution. Thank you World Gym and I am excited to be a customer for many more years to come!< /text>< date>

I've been a member her for well over 10 years and I'm not one to normally complain publicly, but I'm pretty frustrated with this place as of late.

Over the last few years the quality of this has diminished. Machines hardly get fixed and always seem to break, the cardio equipment is always down or malfunctioning and half the dumbbells are either broken or completely missing. There was even a time frame where the bathroom door stall was missing a lock for over a week. Benches have been left broken for weeks and there are many simple things that go uncared for.

Many of the bars for Olympic lifts are completely bent to the point where they really should be changed out, floor mats are damaged etc..

Currently they remodeling and the place is a mess, lots of things have been moved or unavailable, one in particular being the cage for Olympic lifts which was probably the best thing about this place. This gym has been long overdue for a remodel for many years, I am just hoping that it actually gets better and not worse.

Some of the staff here is friendly and polite while others are not. The gym does offer some machines i really do like as they are more old school and I feel work better. My feelings have been quiet mixed about this place as it has been the only gym I've felt like I can always get a good workout, but as of late its all just been frustration. Not sure if this will remain my gym.

Heads up new members always get nice deals for year to year contracts while long term members don't share the same benefit, which has always seemed odd to me.

Anyways, I tried make this as unbias as possible. So maybe take what I say with a grain of salt, but I wouldn't be the first one to complain about these issue.</review>

<Review>Horrible customer service, most equipment is broken or outdated, very dirty floors and some flooring even torn up (which is a BIG hazard in a gym), mens bathroom is unclean 80% of the times I've visited. It's also greatly over populated, which is in itself alone not worth the membership there. Honestly the worst gym I've ever had a membership at, but if you're looking for a workout for cheap this is the place for you. But be warned, you get what you pay for here.

Take a tour of the gym before you sign up if you think any part of my review is untruthful.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I would NOT recommend this gym. They make it impossible to cancel a membership. I went in to try to cancel because I was moving out of state but instead told me I needed to mail a letter with my reason for canceling to that same address I was already at. After I mailed the letter I found out they still continued to charge me. When I called to see what was going on the staff told me someone will call me back and never did. Very unprofessional rude staff that are just trying to take money from people. Also before they told me there would be no cancellation fee because I was a long time member but now they want to charge me for canceling.< /Text>

First, This gym was redesigned to accommodate the group training sessions ( I'm assuming thier money maker) and repositioned all the equipment wherever they could fit it leaving little space for working out. The equipment is outdated, which I don't mind, but there's pins missing on half the machines, cable equipment missing or stolen and dumbbells are scattered with no organization (very hard finding a matching pair). As mentioned on another post people parking at the fire exits which would make it hard to evacuate if there ever was an emergency.

Second, I was a memeber for 3 years and when I asked to cancel my membership the first thing I was asked was "Why" which doesn't even matter in my opinion and shouldn't even be asked. The next thing was the "HIDDEN CANCELATION FEE" of $25, which her response to that was "it's a business" and just smirked. The last thing was I needed to fill out a request and sign just to cancel my membership, she couldn't cancel there on the spot. I didn't know I needed your bosses approval to cancel MY membership, I would find another gym if you could.< /Text>

This gym has its pros and cons I definitely would not recommend this gym its not well organized all the weight machines are scattered all around the gym, the machines are really rusty the restrooms are really dirty worse then any place I have ever seen overall this gym really needs an update in just about everything .. the good thing about this gym is that is has a women's section which I love but again the machines are rusty I absolutely love the boxing room and how the women's have their own sauna in the restroom it's really nice but I don't think it's worth the price< /Review>

<Text>Biggest ripoff ever! I told all my friends not to join and told them about my experience. I signed a contract for a year and they deducted $10 every month I paid $35 application fee.  And then at the end of the year they kept charging so I went to cancel and they charged me $25 fee they say for processing. This is such a rip-off I already paid for one year and then they charge again at the end of the year, after the contract should be over? DON'T JOIN THIS GYM!!!!!</Text>< Pictures>

I come here and get work done. They have everything you need to reach your fitness goals. I can concur with some of the complaints regarding the front desk....minus a few of the employees, Manny, & Rudy( he is always cheerful and responsive and always greets people as they come in and leave the gym). But this gym has come around a lot and transformed. Its 10x better than it was before Worlds Gym.< /text>

I kept going even after they switched to different owners, etc. up until now that it's been World Gym. I spoke to the manager a few months ago because I wanted to lower my monthly payments and was promised a much lower rate. They began charging me that rate for about 4 months and the last 3 months they have been charging me the same previous amount. I've gone in to talk to them, emailed, called and nothing gets this issue resolved. I want to cancel my membership but I've heard horror stories regarding cancelation.

<Review>When joining initially the staff was friendly, but very disorganized. There were mistakes on my paperwork & I was never emailed a copy of my contract. I asked multiple times, but was finally printed a copy. When you first enroll you are given an appointment with a personal trainer. They told me that the trainer would show you how to use all the equipment at the gym. False. They have you work out in the “cage” & do an assessment of your physical abilities. The trainer will speak with you about fitness goals & review pricing for personal session trainings & complete a body analysis. This is not done in private & anyone in the office/around the cage is aware of your height, weight, & body classifications. I signed up for the VIP membership (49.99 per month) & personal training sessions 2x per week (400 per month). After signing up for sessions I went to my first workout, two treadmills and one stationary bike were broken. I notified the front desk & was treated very rudely. Initially I enjoyed the personal training, but found that the training regime was not for me. This gym is focused on bodybuilding/CrossFit style training. If you are seeking training that involves Pilates, yoga, etc. this is NOT the place for you. The gym does not offer space for mat exercises, except for the cage (and you have to be signed up for the VIP package to use it), but be prepared to tuck yourself into a little corner. I suggest bringing your own mat. The gym has two mats (two??) & they never get cleaned. The training staff is very toxic & gossip about each other &clients. I have heard trainers point out clients & make comments about their lack of progress, how they are still overweight, etc. In the main area pins are broken, seats ripped, etc. People also will use equipment as a place to sit and rest (and text), so be prepared to wait for a machine. On my last visit (which is catalyst for me to stop attending this gym) I heard a trainer say that I was a “stay-at-home type” who was making little progress. When I came in to notify my intent to cancel, I did so per the contract’s instructions, 30 days prior to the end. If you cancel be prepared for backlash! When you give your intent to cancel you’re met with rude staff that is unwilling to walk you through the process. You will have to meet with Denise to cancel personal training sessions (if you enrolled), filling out a form that states why your are cancelling. You will not get a copy of this form. I wasn’t given any paperwork notifying my intent to cancel, but was told they would “call me.” I still have time on my contract, so I went to Joe Bustamante to request info on cancellation. He was very rude and escalated the situation by responding aggressively and was very dismissive. He then said I needed to speak with someone named Jenelle and that she wasn’t there. In short, you cannot cancel until 30 days prior to your final month. If you do not cancel they will charge you each month until you cancel. After reviewing my contract, I realized that my credit card on file was about  to expire. Knowing that I needed to finish paying for the remainder of my contract I brought this up and was told I needed to speak with Denise, again, who was not available, and was told I would need to wait or come back. When I stated that I would wait Joe tried to get me to leave the gym, and stated that he would email me. I declined and said I would wait. An hour later when Denise was available I explained that I needed to update my card information. She shared that Joe & another front desk attendant named Randall could do that. (Seriously?!) I requested an email copy of my contract and Joe refused. He stated my physical copy was the same and that I didn’t need it. I pressed and was finally given a copy. Randall updated my payment info, when I said thank you for assisting he was rude in return and asked me to leave. (Even though I am still paying member.) The gym needs to understand that members have a right to cancel and they need to handle these situations with professionalism and tact.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>I would give 0 stars if I could! I canceled my membership because I moved to college and this is the 2nd month I've been charged since I canceled my membership. They make it such a hassle and they need a better system. Horrible service.<//Review><rating>1< /rating></record>

Cardio theater sold me, but it's so outdated. The screen looks very dim and sound is horrible. Half of the machines don't work. This gym has so much potential,  but lacks maintenance.</text>

Employees need to smile more. Expecially front desk. Not even a good morning or hi. I expect good vibes when i walk in the gym. Instead of doing their job. ALWAYS on their phone or eating. Worst gym employees.  Dissapointed< /Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Review>I believe it has to do whether you go distracted with your phone and members are not gonna greet at you by chasing you to greet at you or shake your hand.
Sure the gym needs a better AC/air purifier, new pads on majority of the benches, new floor grip Ruber, and give better lubrication to the machines​. (That work requires time and money that has to come from the gym profit not the owner).
Also is people would care about not dropping weight to the floor that almost want to dig wholes with them,  re-rack weights​ back to its place instead of leaving them who know where. I wouldn't be surprised if there were in the restrooms. People (member have to apport a bit to have the gym great.
They go all sweaty from bench to bench they don't dry or clean with paper. "Carry a gooddam ✋ towel with you" that'll help to have longer life or the benches, re-rack weight back don't be too lazy, if you drop the weights that's means you're not strong enough go lighter on weight till to become stronger.
And get your lazy butt to workout instead of using your cellphone to watch videos or whatever. Let someone else use the them if your too busy with your phone. Stay home save your gym money so you don't have to complain. Care for the gym as it was yours, that way you'll always do a workout at a gym your proud to be member of.

Great gym: I left 24hrs for this one.
The owner is doing great job at having a better gym every day.

To the owner: It would be pretty cool of you to not forget about beach gym, some are red painted and look great but it would be even greater if all of them were repaint red to avoid rusting machines and throw some mirrors.as.a bonus.  Thanks.< /Review><username>Alonso Martii< /username><gmap_id>0x80e84c0eee719d17:0xabc1261ec3a822b3</gmap_id><pics>None<//pics>< Rating>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>I gave it 2 stars because the gym' s appearance at first glance looks pretty good but as my wife and I began to do our workout, we noticed a lot of the equipment are old, the rubber flooring mat is torn in the dumbell area, some of the benches are also torn, and there was a seated bench that had caution tape around it because the metal legs was cracked (this should not be on the floor for use). Weights are just laying everywhere and members don't put them back and there are no signs posted to remind members to re-rack weights (or at least we didn't see any signs). We also didn't notice cleaning wipes or towels for members to wipe down machines and benches when done. We were just visiting on a VIP pass to see if we would like the gym but I didnt like that they keep your I.D. card while you workout so when you finish you have to talk with the sales rep again. When we went to leave, Josh, who we talked to before the workout, had gotten off but the other guy did not know where our I.D.'s were in which the front desk lady had to come show him where they were. Then i tried to buy protein shake but no one was at the counter to take my order. One lady did get a drink out the cooler but did not say anything to me to indicate that someone will assist me or not. I'm not paying that much money and the equipment is outdated, flooring and benches are torn and no one at the counter to buy a protein shake. Josh was very nice to us and showed us around but we came when he was about to get off.< /Text>< Pictures>

This gym and its owners have had a terrible streak of financial issues. I am not surprised ownership has been transferred many times. I closed my membership with World Gym in early 2016; however, they decided to continue withdrawing membership dues from my bank in November. I have requested refunds of the unauthorized charges they still continue to withdraw from my account and they have yet to do anything about it. I would not trust this business with your financial information, if they guarantee that there will be no issues, think again and run out the door.<//review>

(Translated by Google) The attention in previous years was regular, but now it is very bad, the new personnel do not have clear information. The person who answers the phone hangs up on you. If you have doubts you have to go personally and when you are there as they do not have enough knowledge they redirect you to an email. The website is not up-to-date, you don't know if all the facilities are working or just outside. I definitely do not recommend it. Besides that you have been paying in quarantine they should provide a better service. 👎

(Original)
La atención en años anteriores era regular, pero ahora es malísima, el personal nuevo no tiene la información clara. La persona que contesta el teléfono te cuelga. Si tienes dudas tienes que ir personalmente y cuando estás allí cómo no tienen suficiente conocimiento te redireccionan a un correo electrónico. La página de internet no está actualizada no sabes si ya está funcionando todas las instalaciones o solo afuera. Definitivamente no lo recomiendo. Aparte que has estado pagando en la cuarentena deberían brindar un mejor servicio. 👎< /Review>

My own car was is the shop for a week or two for repairs, and originally I was stuck with a very bare bones, simple compact car like I was in my 20s. Now that I’m in my 50s, I wanted to Thank Chris over at Hertz San Pablo, for going the extra mile to get me into a sleek, lovely Altima by closing time the second day! Now these days will be a pleasure, and I feel like a preferred and satisfied customer! Thanks Chris!</Review>

Friendly staff, clean vehicle, exactly the truck we reserved online for our over the weekend get away. When picking up the truck, we arrived when they had just opened for the day and it was quick, easy and had us out of there in no time. When returning we weren’t so lucky. It took a little longer due to us arriving after they had opened and customers mostly all coming back to drop off their vehicles but the staff all had good customer service. Will def. rent from here again!</review>

I called to say I would be 5 mins late after closing and was told to not even bother to show up that they were just gna charge me for an extra day and as soon as 5pm hit they were closing the door and leaving. Being that i work in customer service, this is super unprofessional as it doesn't take so much time. Not just this happened I had called to extend my rental for an extra 2 days and was told they had to put another 200 dollar hold on my credit card plus what is would cost for the extra 2 days. Like seriously you are already holding money why charger more. I DO NOT AND I MEAN I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80857785248e49f7:0xb9877a70fa010214< /gmap_id></record>

<review>Horrible wait time! The employees do not acknowledge you when enter! If they don’t have the accurate employees to work during peak times hire more people or schedule them correctly! People are rude and it’s ridiculous! Only reason why I’m here is because it’s what AAA told me to get! I will be making sure I don’t come back!</review>< pictures>

The staff is eager to help you out when you walk through the doors. I was given a choice of two vehicles to choose from , when I arrived, they didn't have the size I had reserved and they upgraded the size at No extra cost. Price and reservations is easy to do online and saves time when you arrive on the day of pick up. I have enjoyed renting vehicles from Hertz....  Thank you.< /Review>

Hertz. Just the name says Car Rental made easy! They picked us up and brought me to their business location. They didn't have my reserv number yet but that didn't stop them from assigning me a new car. In and out sooner than I expected. Everyone was nice and very helpful. Will come back soon I tell you!

Today they charged me a $300 smoking cleaning fee because they found "green leafy plant material" on the floor. They literally stole my money. These people should be in jail. DO NOT visit this terrible place.</Text>

<Text>Worst service ever. Came in at 4:45pm to get a car didn’t leave the place til 6:40pm. TWO HOURS for them to clean a “very very very very dirty car”. I was the only one in there when I came in while new people arrived and left with a car. One person got their car cleaned and ready to go before me even though she came in an hour after me. Only one person working counters and I believe one cleaning since it took them two hours to clean mine. I asked if I could take the car to the car wash on my own time since i needed to go but they totally ignored me and proceeded to take another 10 mins for them to take it to the car wash. The car wasn’t even that clean, by the way. Get your stuff together Hertz San Pablo, and hire more workers.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The girl who assisted with my rental pick up was not very friendly and not clear on the charges. I forgot to fill up the gas tank more before dropping it off and it was half a gallon short (in a toyota Corolla) and they told me i could either fill it up myself or they would charge me $66 to do it.< /Text>

Service is great but very pricey I had rented a car for a week due to car in shop I called and ask if I can turn it in two days early they said yes but it would end up costing more to turn it in early</Text>

Ryan the manger is great. But ive had to stand in lines for to long. They never return your calls or you set on hold for 30 minutes and longer. Each car i rented smelled like B.O. or cigs. Not clean inside. Had peoples stuff left in them. One of the cars brakes went out i told them about it. They said to bring car back and would deduct from price. I never got a price deduction. Plus was charged for not filling tank . o.k. you try to drive a car using the E brake to a gas station and hope u dont get killed or kill someone else. But i get charged $59.00 for a half a tank of gas. And i was told i didnt have to gas the car due to brake problems.</Text>

When I went to pick up my car even though it was prepaid for they wouldn't let me pick it up because I was not my husband even though I had his card along with my card to the same account.  I had to use another card before they let me pick up the car.< /review>

This is an old but great neighborhood store.  Sad to know it's closing in two weeks.  Great employees, helpful, and friendly.  Still keeping a brave face even though they don't know where they will land yet.  Not many other stores nearby so this is a loss to our area.</review>

Every time I shop here, I always find the most organized, clean, and fresh produce, and more. The staff is pretty quiet but courteous. Some prices are a little up there, but for the majority of the store, the prices rock! I will always gladly shop here than other places<//review>

Best selection of fruits and vegetables. And meat selections unlike chain grocery stores. Only place I know to get a 15lbs beef brisket.< /text>

Good deals and sale prices. The issue is that OFTEN, VERY OFTEN, Smart &  Final is out of items on sale or are featured. Some produce appears very ripe and needed to be used in a day or so. When shopping here pay attention.< /Text>

Decent prices on a lot of bulk items however some things you really have to watch the price as they aren't really a bargain.  I like some of the items are commercial/wholesale bulk items that aren't at the two big box stores locally.  e.g. cleaning supplies that aren't box store brand knock-offs. Pkg is bulk size not multi-pack for consumers.< /Text>

I only go for sale items. The checkers make a lot of mistakes. OFTEN the store is out of sale items in the middle of the sale and quality of produce is, at times, suspect. Some bargains to be had but pay close attention<//review>

Not enough aisles open.
When you walk up to the only decent line, the Hispanic cashier girl finishes ringing up her customer then closes as the other lines have gotten even longer.

Brian and Jake came to my home well prepared, masks on and shoe covers for their boots. They were professional and  very neat doing their job. They were great at explaining what needed to be done. Also I received a text with a picture of them before they arrived!! They did an awesome job. I turned my air on today and it works better than it has in a long time!! I'm so thrilled I called Shaw's Air Conditioning and Heating..Thank you so much!!<//Text>

Perfect and honest service from Shaw's. I have a older unit and was expecting the tech to try and upsell me on repairs or something else. All I received was honest service. My unit just needed some general maintenance. If you could request a specific tech. to come out to your home I would Highly recommend Max. After speaking to him I forgot he was my AC technician. His customer service is 10/10. Give Max a raise!< /Review>

<text>Jorge is an honest and personable salesman.

He take time to explain the product in detail and answered all of our questions.

We trust his opinion and know that he is available to answer all questions.

We currently have a mini split system he installed earlier this year. We love the unit and it works so efficiently.

We strongly recommend working with Jorge.

Feel free to contact us and take a look at the mini split system installed.

It's great to spend money and work with someone you trust who treats you like family.< /text><Time>1615415171837< /Time><gmapID>0x8094c78cf7e35057:0x421be48f0a5402c4</gmapID><user_id>103160653575686143421< /user_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rating>

From planning, install, and a year later, maintenance. These guys are knowledgeable, polite, and their prices are reasonable. You could pay less, but if you want a complete and professional install and service, go with Shaw’s. I had my system replaced by them last year and just had it serviced by them. Max, my service technician was very knowledgeable and polite, he made sure I knew what to look for to make sure the system was operating properly and verified that it was. Thanks Shaw’s!< /Text>

The technician who came out and repaired our AC unit was very knowledgeable and had great customer service skills. He got our home cooling down right away. We are extremely pleased with his service and are grateful that he was able to come out to our home after hours. I definitely recommend Shaw’s for problems with AC system.< /Text>

We contract with Shaws every year for routine maintenance and repairs as needed. Always prompt and service personnel are second to none. Always polite, professional and honest. Can’t beat the prices for service contract either.<//Review>

The entire team was very helpful and knowledgeable about what they were doing and on how to help even someone who doesn’t know anything get up to speed.  They showed up on time if not early and got in did what they needed to do and got out as quickly as they could ans I couldn’t be more happy with how everything turned out from the equipment to the services provided I would and will highly recommend them to anyone who asks or is seeking assistance.< /Text>

I've been a customer of Shaws for the last 5 years! They installed a brand new unit and duct work and have continued with the maintenance twice a year. The lady/ladies in the office are kind, accommodating and fantastic to work with. The service men are great too! Today Max did the maintenance work and he is super kind and friendly! Any time any one asks for AC company recommendations, I ALWAYS recommend Shaws AC! Thank you for your great service!<//text>

Tech Jacob was very  thorough and explained in detail what services he was performing. He asked if I had any questions before he performed the service and after he completed the service. Very friendly and professional.< /review>
</record></dataset><record>
<Text>Max was awesome! Always service my system to keep it at its optimum performance! I try to keep it running & serviced correctly! Units are very PRICEY so maintaining them is KEY! On 12/28/2020 Jacob installed a new heater blower fan. He did a good job. My only concern was it happened just 3 WEEKS after my annual heater checkup. I'm trying to take care of my heating and cooling units to AVOID these expensive repairs. But I guess not. "The ounce of prevention rule" does not apply...... Oh well.< /Text>< user_name>

<Review>We had some trouble with our AC the beginning of June and I called Shaw's and they immediately sent out a tech.  He took care of the problem.  Weather was cool, so we did not use the AC immediately.  We then started the AC and it began blowing cool air, but not enough to bring down our AC lower than 83 degrees.  I contacted Shaw's after hours and they immediately came out to figure out what the problem was.  It turns out that our AC was not blowing sufficient cool air to take bring down our AC from 85 degrees.   While we were trying to decide what action to take, one night I woke up during the night because I smelled something burning.  My husband went outside to make sure that our AC was not on fire.  Turns out that our AC had finally gave out.  Our house was at 89 degrees inside and Shaw's came out and brought us a portable unit to use for free.  Luckily we had a service contract, so we only had to pay the regular service charge (no OT).  Every time thereafter we did not have to pay a service charge until they were able to figure out what the problem was.
Shaw's gave us an estimate, which included a new AC unit, new Duct work (orig duct work 1976), larger Air Vents (that allow more air to flow), Return Air Filter (sucks up the hot air and allows the circulation of cool air to flow) and the installation of a new Thermostat, Carbon Monoxide sensor/alarm, and Fire Alarms in all 3 bedrooms.  We also received 10 year Warranty on parts and labor, 2 year service plan.  They disposed of the old unit and all of the old ductwork, including the old unit.  Last time we had the AC replaced, we had to pay for the disposal of the unit.  Once installed (87 degrees inside/ 102 outside) it took the unit an hour to come down to 80 degrees.  After an 1 1/2 hrs it was at 75 degrees.  We are so happy with the choice that we made to go with Shaw's.  I recommend them to anyone who is in need of AC or Heating services.   We are very impressed with the professional service that we received from Shaw's staff - Karen, Jenny, Victor, Derek, Martin, Brian, Antonio, Angel, Hayden.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>When it’s hot the last thing anyone needs is their  A/C to stop working.  I found myself needing service and knew exactly what company to call.  When a company makes a excellent first impression they will always be who you suggest to other and always be your go to for service.   Within a day of making the call to Shaw’s I had an appointment for the next day.   I was impressed with the communication they use that alerts you via text letting you know of your appointment and when the technician was on the way.   The technician was very thorough with explaining what he was going to do before inspection and went through with pictures of the areas needing repair, the best part was everything was fixed on the spot.  Your employees are a reflection of your company, and it can be good or bad.  From my interaction with the technician (Max) you can tell he took pride in his job, that is an amazing work ethic!  Thank you Shaw’s for making customer service a priority, it shows in your employees interaction and overall knowledge.  Most importantly Thank you for continuing to keep us cool in the summer and warm in the winter!< /text>< user_name>

Shaw's has the best customer service around. From the first phone call to schedule to the service technicians and all the way to the billing department. They are all first class and they care. Shopping local definitely pays off when it comes to Shaw's. When in doubt give them a call and let them show that they are different then other companies. Most of all they are honest and have a great value for the quality work they do. Thank you Shaw's keep up the great work.</Text>

<review>Had our ac unit cleaned & inspected this morning, our technician Max was super helpful & super nice! Loved the communication method they use; we were sent text reminders of our upcoming appointment & the morning of our appointment we were provided a text message letting us know technician was on his way that included a picture & brief bio of our technician. Keep rocking it Shaw’s Air!!<//review></record>

I needed my unit looked at and called Shaw's. I got a same day appointment due to the fact my heater went out on me and my family. The technician who came out was James Charlton who did an amazing job. He was very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. We went over different options on the issue with my unit. He was very easy to work with and thoroughly explained the different parts of the unit and what the issue was. He made sure to continue to check and recheck the unit till he figured out the issue. I highly recommend  Shaw's Air Conditioning & Heating and ask for James! Thank you!</review>

<Review>Shaws has always been a pleasure to work with. My most recent appointment with Jacob Chieze was another example of of a positive experience with Shaws; Personable, timely, kind, and thorough. I have tried other servicing companies in the area in the past and there is a huge contrast between Shaws and the rest, in my experience, and Shaws is the only company I will recommend. You will feel like a valued customer. I’m happy to be able to support Jacob Chieze and the rest of Shaw’s staff. Good customer service is hard to come by and Shaws doesn’t fall short.< /Review>< Rate>

<username>J S</username><review>Once again, Shaw's Air Conditioning & Heating did an outstanding job. They had installed a new A/C Heat combo unit 16 months ago and did a fantastic job with the installation. The heater was kicking on and off so I called Shaw's this morning and they sent a technician out the same day. James Charlton was the tech and he was very friendly and knowable. Not only did he fix the problem but he did my winter maintenance on the unit at the same time. I can't say enough good things about Shaw's and their staff. Everyone I have talked to has been extremely friendly and professional. James did a fantastic job and was a pleasure to converse with. James is a great asset to Shaw's A/C.< /review><rate>5</rate><response>{'time': 1577996708047, 'text': 'Thank you so much! James is one of our great technicians.

<Review>Tim Dodd showed up on time and did a typical “Shaw’s HVAC Excellent” service on our HVAC system. Additionally, Tim provided excellent answers to all of my questions and HVAC system concerns.  Shaw’s Heating and Cooling remains an excellent value for the money we invest in periodic HVAC system maintenance. Thanks again Tim!   Also, Aubrey was simply awesome in working with my schedule to get this service done at a time that fit my schedule perfectly.  In a nutshell, Tim and Aubrey represent outstanding Customer service at Shaw’s.< /Review><user_id>105829486508347381643</user_id><Resp>{'time': 1605716496829, 'text': 'Hi Bruce!

I do take the blame on this as I probably should have said no to the service and researched the problem. But when there are temps of 108 and your AC goes out, you'd expect a company to not take advantage of the situation. They charged $400ish for a capacitor that is only $65, when asked if they had anything other than this "special" capacitor, they said no they don't and this is the only one they use. Then they charge a diagnostic fee of $89 which they don't even use to offset the cost if you decide to go on with the repair. Obscene upmarket charge and I feel that the tech lied when he said they don't carry a normal capacitor for my unit. But I have to keep my family cool during these hot times. Already submitted a review on BBB and a complaint.</text>

I have been using SHAW'S on and off for about 4 and a half years. After 1.5 years of not having service done (due to my own hardships) I called them back out. Jeff R. Was as expected... thorough, thoughtful and beyond professional. He not only Serviced my existing unit but signed me up once again for the yearly service, which served in my best interest!
I would/will continue to give my personal recommendation of Shaw's due to their continual maintenance without being "pushy" about products that I simply can not afford. Their family friendly approach, while explaining and truly helping me understand what may come to be expected is beyond reproach ! They are so "human"..
Jeff and the team... are all so warm, considerate and accommodating.
Thank you so much Shaw's!!</review>

I have history in dealing with Shaw's in the business realm and was eager to have them help out with our AC/Heater replacement in our home.  Installation was on time, professional and courteous.  When the men left, the house was spotless as if no construction had even taken place.  I highly recommend Shaw's for whatever needs you have concerning AC/Htr.</Review>

Jeff was very efficient and knowledgeable.  When I made my appointment I told the person on the phone what other things I was interested in getting information on.  Jeff had all of the information and who to contact at the company.
Shaw's Heating and Air Conditioning is going to be my new service company.  They have great customer service and they provide service for multiple things that are of need for my home.
Thank you Jeff and Shaw's.< /text>

Office staff was very helpful when I called regarding services despite me calling three times as I kept forgetting to ask something.  They give you a two hour service time window which is much nice than a four hour window.  They arrived pretty close to the start of the time frame and were very professional.  Brian took the time to explain the situation and my options.<//review>

<Text>We are very glad we found Shaw's heating and air. We called them to get a second opinion about our AC unit and they came out free of charge and inspected the unit. We then scheduled Victor to come out and give us a quote and Victor was the only one out of the many companies we called that noticed that the home warranty company installed the wrong compressor which is why our AC was not working. After being denied by the home warranty company for them to fix their mistake we decided to go with Shaw's to replace the whole unit. They were able to install the unit at the end of the week offered financing and during the install did a fantastic job. My neighbor was getting a new AC unit that same day as well and I'm proud to say Shaw's finished a few hours before them and cleaned up all the debris. The guys that came out were great very pleasant to work with and explained every step to me. Victor even replaced our vents to the correct vents we needed and installed an amazing thermostat. We are so happy we found Shaw's and love that fact that if we have any issues we can call them and they come by very professionally and we feel comfortable about having them in our home. Shaw's is a fantastic company that still treat there customers like family one thing that is hard to find with many companies we look forward to using Shaw's in the future.<//Text><Resp>{'time': 1565843813790, 'text': 'All I can say is wow!

3/16/2021 update:
Brent was the technician again and I was notified via text that he was on his way. It came with a picture and a brief bio! Haha, that's fun. He came right at the beginning of the two hour scheduled time slot, so I really appreciate that. As always, he was very friendly and courteous and did the job well! Shaw's is great, thank you so much!

7/7/2020 update:
Max V. was the technician who came out today and he was very friendly, courteous, and made sure to answer all of my questions. He was thorough in his inspection and provided me with lots of information. Shaw's also sent me a reminder email for my semi-annual maintenance check-up which I really appreciated. You all are great, thanks again!

I have been a customer of Shaw's for a few years now and they are great in many ways. All of their technicians are knowledgeable and friendly. They also send reminder emails for service, which I appreciate.

Today Brent was awesome. He called me to let me know he was ahead of schedule and asked if he could come by early, which was great. He also identified and fixed a problem with my Nest thermostat which someone else had installed. Thank you so much Brent! He went above and beyond the standard service today and for that I will be a life-long customer of Shaw's.< /Text>

<Review>Several weeks ago my ac stopped working :( Brian came out and gave me the bad news about a leak. I begged him to try and keep it going for just a little longer, so he did :) But we have known for a long time that it's time to replace the unit. Of course it died the hottest weekend of the summer! So we called Victor out to go over having it replaced. He was so nice and worked really hard to get it done as quickly as he could. Within the week Juan and Angel got it replaced for us. We have been living in a nice cool environment ever since! Also having fun with our new Ecobee thermostat :) We appreciate all of the staff and enjoy our working relationship. Cheers to Shaw's AC and Heating team! Thanks guys and gals :)</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I had my HVAC unit replaced in November. The work was carefully planned out and completed. Shaw's worked around are schedule and we couldn't be happier.

We did have one small glitch when the Ecobee thermostat stopped functioning. I notified Shaw's and they surprised us with a same day visit. After testing the entire system, they determined it was only the thermostat and it was replaced.  We have been comfortable since then.

After getting quotes from other companies, we are glad we selected Shaw's</Review>

My A/C unit stopped working on a Sunday. I placed the service call through the AHS website, being sent to a company that couldn’t get to me until Friday. It’s triple digits in my location and I have a special needs child. Had to call AHS for assistance. They sent the service call to StandLee in Visalia which couldn’t help until Wednesday. They came out, spending 10 minutes to tell me what was wrong with it stating, “ . . .  it the fan motor which we have to go back to the shop to get. We will have to reschedule to come back out to bring the part to fix it. The receptionist will have to reschedule for another day because we have other service calls . . . “This was not acceptable due to my husband and I taking time off work to deal with this matter and had to make arrangements for my son’s care. My husband contacted a local company, Shaw’s A/C and heating, and they came out and fixed my unit the same day with such efficiency, paying attention to details. In regards to StandLee, I would not recommend them to anyone for any kind of service. I would highly recommend Shaw’s and will utilize them for future maintenance of my unit.<//text>

AC unit old and not producing. Needless to say it was a hot beginning to our summer. Scheduled multiple companies to get an idea on pricing. Scheduled an appointment with Victor to determine whether Shaw's would be installing a whole new ac/heat unit. The appointment went very well. Victor was very knowledgeable and educated us on what type of system needed to ensure air flow along with power efficiency. Additionally, we reiterated the urgency, due to the triple digit heat. From beginning to end the process was only about a week. No one at this time of year could provide this service except Shaw's. Well done!!!! Our Family appreciated your work with professionalism and understanding our urgency. Thank you😀👍🏻< /review>

Hired shaw's to investigate a possible leak. Found leak was in a bad spot. Sorry I dont remember the young guys name. Had a good head on his shoulders tho. Shaws sent out Victor to talk dollars. Decided to go with a replace over a fix. He found me a good deal. Unfortunately no vet discounts. Fellows came to install. They was like an hour late. The rest of the install was extremely nice. They were out shortly after 3pm.

Shaw’s Air Conditioning & Heating did a superb job installing our new AC unit, along with our new solar panels on our home. They were efficient & knowledgeable in the product & they educated us how we would now be saving money in the long run. They’re employees were kind to our family when they were working & I can’t say enough good things about this company.</review>

Very nice experience with Shaw’s!  Right from the get go, Victor helped with providing us options on fixing our AC problems. Then the install team, Angel and Juan, did a great job with getting us up and running. Loved how they put down tarps to keep the house clean. Brandon helped out a ton by getting the portable AC units working that first evening when the main AC unit wasn’t quite ready. Thanks to all.<//Text>

Great service! They came when they said they would.  Explained their maintenance program and associated costs.  They had the parts I needed to get my unit running again.  Their technician, Brian, did great to work with.  He answered my questions and explained what he needed to do to get my unit running again. I recommend them to other home owners. Thank you Shaw's A/C and Heating.</review>

AC went out on a Friday called Shaws and had someone out to look at unit within 2 hours. Aside from needing to ship the part and it being a weekend unit was fixed by Tuesday. No.complaints. worked on our roof for multiple hours in 100+ degree weather without one single complaint. Enjoyed thier eagerness to fix the problem in a timely matter. Parts were under warranty labor was a bit pricey but that's as expected..</Review>

< Review>
Brent was great. After an hour and a half and he still  couldn’t find the exact problem the owner JEFF came over and they both searched and found these (2) extremely small parts that were ruptured. 9 straight years I’ve had issues and I found someone who actually cared enough to ‘find’ the problem. My husband is disabled and can’t be in the heat and knowing this they continued their search! I will never go elsewhere they were so fast and professional and Lindsay in the office was so great! Local business is best! They will always have my business! Thank you Shaw’s! Honestly they were awesome...</Review>

I'm always a little apprehensive about hiring contractor's so I emailed Shaw's.  I got a call and we agreed upon a diagnostic at a convenient time for me.

Their tech, Brian, called and showed up early.  He greeted us, put on his shoe covers, and looked at my thermostat.  He told me what he was going to do and quickly got to work.  He saw me outside while he was working and gave me a little info on what he was doing and his suspicion on what might be wrong.  He also gave me a tip on using the built-in AC filter as an option to the in-house duct filter. As we spoke, he gave me the option of signing up for their maintenance program, but he didn't push it.  He suggested how it could save money even on today's visit.

Shortly thereafter, he came down to test the AC unit via the thermostat and went up to do some additional work.  By this time I opted for the maintenance agreement and he took care of maintenance right after the repair.

We then looked over the charges, discussed my questions, and Brain took off.

I was pleased at the efficiency and straight-forward and friendly interaction.

Definitely recommended.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

When my Air Conditioning went out on a hot summer day,  I called Shaw's AC and Heating. Lindsey was very nice on the phone and gave me the soonest appointment they had, which fortunately was only two days away. Martin came out well within the given time. He explained what our unit needed and gave us two options to fix it. He fixed it that same day! Martin was friendly, efficient, and explained exactly what he would be doing. Choose Shaw's for your repair and maintence service!<//text>

<Review>I have had Service with Shaw’s Air Conditioning for a few years.  Recently however, I request work be performed on two of my homes in Lemoore.  Well I received invoices and they had charged my card without my authorization.  When I called to ask about the two invoices and work supposedly an inspection that had been done for which I declined.  But the gal who I talked to went on to tell me that the technician had actually only gone to one house and never saw the other and that the charged amount on the two invoices was actually for only the one house they went to.  I never received a call to authorize the work or even a call to tell me how much the charges were.  But I can’t believe they charged for both the houses and only did work on one, the gal said it was a mistake, really??  This is fraudulent, beware of keeping your card on file with these people, they will automatically charge you for work you didn’t authorize and for work they didn’t do.  In the end they didn’t offer to refund me the unauthorized charge on the work they didn’t do on the one house.  I am going to talk to my credit card company about this as this is fraudulent to automatically charge without authorization.  The better business bureau will also be contacted.<//Review><Rating>1< /Rating><gmap_id>0x8094c78cf7e35057:0x421be48f0a5402c4</gmap_id>< UserId.>

When our A/C went out they were very fast to come out and look at the problem first time couldn't figure it out call some other people same result. Call them back turns out it was to compressor that failed. They were very helpful in helping us get the correct size replacement for the house. They hooked us up with a portable unit for the family room. once everything came in it was installed fast. had solar panels installed also the first set went up quick took a little longer for the second set. they didn't pick up after them self from the roof job and a few tiles were broke in the processes. they are very hard to work with after the job is done. I am going on 12 months for the process from start to now.<//Review>

He gave us some suggestions to help keep our energy usage down.  He is "god" in our household.  He came through right in the middle of one of those heat waves, our unit has never cooled so well.

I received a mailer from Shaw’s Air Conditioning and Heating. After reading numerous glowing reviews I decided to give them a call. I am so glad that I called them. I have a large home with 2 A/C units. I wanted to replace the larger unit that serviced the first story of my home. Victor came to my house and explained the different options available to me. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and professional. His quote for a new 4 ton, 16 seer, combo unit was over $2,000 less then a different companies’s estimate. After meeting with Victor I felt comfortable, and confident that Shaw’s was the right company for my needs. The install team of Angel, and Antonio came out first thing, on the morning of my appointment, and worked through the day fabricating and prepping a new base for the new Coleman A/C unit. They spent a few more hours on the next day prepping everything for the new unit, including a new gas line and new wiring. The job turned out to be more difficult then when we first looked at it but they did a phenomenal job with the installation. They even had to cut branches off of my trees in order to lift my old unit out and drop the new unit in by crane. They installed a new Ecobee4 WiFi, Alexa enabled thermostat with room sensors and by 2:30 of the second day, my new A/C unit was up and running. I couldn’t be happier with the new A/C unit. It is much more energy efficient then my 28 year old, 5 ton unit. I can not say enough good things about Shaw’s and their employees. I am so pleased with their quality of service and work. I am considering installing solar on my roof early next year and I am definitely going to have Shaw’s design and install the system. It was a very relaxed and unstressful experience from start to finish.< /text>

<date>1469757936448</date><Review>Our technician arrived at the house, stayed on his phone for 30 minutes in the car, got out and worked for 45 minutes, and went back down to play with his phone for another 30 minutes. Terrible communication and poor work ethic--Shaw's AC in Lemoore has some of the worse technicians I've dealt with. It's 6:45pm and we're in 110 degree weather; I was assured the AC would be fixed around 1:30, after already having them show us late or not show up at all for the past 2 days. This is ridiculous...</Review>< response>

Had two vehicles repaired at this shop.  Both vehicles have broken down numerous times for the same original repair.  Stay away from this shop, they take your money and dont fix anything.  I have already paid them $4500 for both vehicles repairs. The owner has not even reached out to me  to discuss these problems or some way to resolve them.  I am a disabled vet on a limited income, nice way for a local business owner to take advantage of veteran's in his community.

Update 4-21-21
Owner finally responded to my review and had an employee (Brandon) call me.  To sum up everything.... My wife's vehicle was taken in for repairs and after several thousand dollars the same problems reappeared a short time later each time.  It was if the mechanic did a band aid repair in hopes of making more money on bogus future repairs.  One repair done by my son was a faulty oil cap ($20).  End result, the vehicle still looses power and burns oil and Brandon states that she now needs a new engine or have the engine completely rebuilt.  The only way the owner can make this right is to refund the money for all the incorrect unnecessary repairs and allow us to use the money to have another mechanic make the necessary correct repairs and allow us to put this entire horrible experience behind us and have a reliable vehicle for my wife to earn an income to support her family.<//Text>

We are a family owned business and would never take advantage of our customers. The part we replaced on your truck ended up being a defective part, and unfortunately that happens, but we warrantied that part out and fixed it for you same day with no charge and it was ok after that. On the other vehicle it was brought back to us and we ran through everything that we had fixed and the vehicle was running fine, all of the work that we had done was ok, we have all the documents, data and tests that show that all the work we had done was fine and that the car was running fine. Again we apologize that you are not satisfied and if there's anything else we can do for you just let us know."}</Resp>< Date>

<Time>1620278303379<//Time><rate>5</rate><Review>Went in for an alignment after seeing an advertised coupon price. Had an issue with the price not being what was originally told and the timeframe for a completion. Instead of leaving in frustration I was able to talk to the owner and he couldn’t have been a nicer individual. He made it rite and took care of me. They completed the wheel alignment for me at the advertise price which was half of all the other shops. And theQuality of work was top-notch. Very friendly staff, I will definitely use them in the future for my alignment needs. Also they have great communication letting you know when your vehicle is done and showing you exactly what was done. Highly recommend the shop!<//Review>< pictures>

I went here for my first time for an alignment. The guys here were so nice. Pretty good that they give you a full car checkup and send it directly to your phone with pictures. I would definitely come again. Look at different places and the price here was the best around.<//Review>

<review>Appointment is required which I like. They gave me an ETA of 1 hour and 30 minutes but finished within the hour. There’s nothing more I dislike than when I’m given an ETA and they take way longer than said. Anyways, went in for an alignment and my car feels great. They do a free inspection and go over the report with you which is awesome. Found a deal on Groupon and was skeptical at first but glad I chose this place to take care of my car. Overall GREAT!< /review>< userid>

They put me in quickly, and the work was done very professionally.  They sent me the info on my front end to my phone.  I could see almost immediately what needed to be done.  And when they were done , I received the new specs.< /review>< pics>

These guys are real nice and upfront and will even show you the parts in question or take pictures!  Really cool and honest.  I just found this place recently but they definitely have a customer forever now! Thanks guys!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I found this place through groupon and I'm so glad I did. Ken is extremely helpful and honest. They don't take there time to service your vehicle. They are so reliable and it's family owned. They are not expensive, they do great quality of work. If you are looking for a auto repair spot look no more! You Will not be disappointed!<//review>

I was referred by America’s Tire and I was very happy with the customer service Bear provided. Generally I worry about being taken advantage of, but felt there was an honesty vibe there. Taylor was beyond helpful getting me started with an appointment. Once there, they worked with me to get the cost within my budget and something I could afford. I’m grateful!</Text>

Called an Taylor he was professional, compassionate and patient with my concerns of my vehicle. I arrived in a peaceful pleasant atmosphere, the gentleman that examined my vehicle as well was courteous & professional explained all my questions. I recommend the business to family and friends.
As I entered my vehicle, there was this small token of treats, y’all are Too SWEET. Grateful for a wonderful experience.

< Review>
I was highly recommended by another shop who couldn't do Alignment on my F350 long bed. However when present I asked about their oil change and I was told they did full synthetic valvoline oil, then I discovered and witnessed them using O'Reilly oil instead of the product I was being billed for. Incredibly unprofessional and dishonest shop. I would caution people about this place.<//Review>

Great customer service, knowledgeable staff and great work in a timely manner.

I had rebuilt my front end and I just needed an alignment to get my vehicle road worthy. Bear did a great job! I am very mechanically inclined and do most of my own work, so I know good shops when I see one. Bear Alignment and Break is a shop I can recommend to my family and my friends,  and now you as well!
Thank you Bear Alignment and Break</review>

Bear Alignment is awesome. They are professionals that take the time out to check exactly what your vehicle needs. The prices are competitive and in a number of services lower than alignment & brake shops in the area.
They also display excellent customer service which I find very important. I had the pleasure of dealing with Selena, Marcus and T.J., Each of which met me with a sincere smile and genuine kindness. Speaking to them assured me that I was in good hands. I highly recommend "Bear Alignment & Brake" for your vehicle's.< /review>

Off the bat the atmosphere was great, the staff was friendly, very helpful, informative and detailed from the service and towards any questions I needed answered. They honored their online coupon and I am returning for a future service with great pricing attached to it. I do recommend this shop to anyone looking for a more detailed oriented setting with experts that are very thorough and knowledgeable. This shop is a hidden jewel not known to many so I am spreading the word to all with confidence that you wouldn't be dissapointed after your first visit. Guaranteed!!!<//Review>< Pics>

Nice clean location with friendly, knowledgeable and professional staff that goes above and beyond to ensure 100% satisfaction. I recommend this location if you want things done right and at a reasonable price. Seal of approval from a guy that only wants the best for his cars.
Ps. The call after I left the shop and the fresh mints in the car were a very kind gesture.</Review>

Consumer be warned! I went in for a front end alignment and was told that my center link, pitman arm, etc.. had to be replaced before they could do it for $1200(I declined the repairs). They were unaware that I had brand new ones previously installed by Diesel Emissions Direct. So I went to Magnolia Wheel Alignment and Break Center and had it looked by experienced mechanics. They immediately could tell my front end was brand new and only recommend new boots. Only $150 including labor. I really don't think they are shady or are crooks but definitely very inexperienced over at bear. Being an amateur mechanic and having several family members who are expert mechanics I would Steer clear of this shop.<//text>

{'time': 1570549269028, 'text': "Hi yolanda... Im sorry you were disappointed.  I'm not sure why you felt it was  a gender problem.. 90% of the time our female customer service rep answers the phone.  They are trained to ask how you know you need brakes, because it helps us to with the follow up questions.  there are many parts to brakes. we don't know if you are having a hydraulic problem or a friction problem.. or you may not be having a problem at all.  We always offer a free brake inspection before trying to give you prices on things that aren't 100% the problem.  I hope that helps and you would re-consider the review and give us the opportunity to check your brake system for free.. thank you"}< /Response>

<text>I am a hummus and falafel snob, and I admit their hummus and falafel is pretty legit ! The foul was not authentic but it was good. They customer service is great and their happy hours are so generous. This branch's falafel is way more delicious than falafel Arax in Beirut. This place will be in my priority list on every time I come to Glendale.<//text>< Rating>

Good tasting shawarma, good sauces, fresh bread. The staff that was running the place can use some training however. It s a food place, it doesn't hurt to smile a bit.

I would definitely go back. BTW, they have a happy hour 2 to 5, buy one sandwich,  get one free. Great deal.<//review>

Best falafel ever Friend brought me falafel in pita and side of hummus for lunch from Glendale location. I grew up in LA and have eaten falafel across the city — all three Me & Me outlets (RIP), Falafel King in Westwood, Zankou, Al Wazir, Maroush, Carousel, Carnival are just some of the places I can recall by name. The falafel  here is fresh, tender, and perfectly spiced, the addition of mint, plus radish—so good.  I made sure to save the wrapper so I could Google it and plan a trip there.  The hummus is perfect—texture/mouth feel, flavor all spot on.  I eat a lot of hummus at home and out, and I cant wait to try the Hollywood branch in person.< /Text>

Surprisingly delicious falafel. They have some solid meal options for quick eats. Has a place in my heart next to Zankou.< /text>

Pink garlic sauce is better than most places . Took a detour from Mediterranean Triangle (my usual spot in Glendale) which hands down has fresher and better flavored food.<//text>< resp>

Rip off menu prices and small portions, you can get similar food in a restaurant for lower prices, my 12 years son was angry on me for buying there.< /Review>

I was very impressed with how accurate the X-ray tech was. She was extremely careful to make sure that everything was at a very precise angle to get the very best views!

I have had lots of x-rays a lot of different places and usually they put you in the basic position oh, walk away and take the x-ray. I know some people must complain but isn't it better for the doctor to have the best view possible to see what's going on? I highly appreciate that!!</review>

I was in a bit of a hurry, and asked if I could be done by 2:30, this was April 13, 2021. The young guy at the front desk wasn’t sure.  Since I was a walk in (x-ray), he gave me additional times I might come in. I told him, I’d risk it and stay.   As I was waiting, he came out to ask, if 2:30 was it, or was there some leeway.  I stated 2:45 would work.  He said we can make that happen.  A short time later the tech came to get me and i was finished well before 2:30.  The tech was funny and kind.  The young guy at the front was a boss.  I should have gotten his name.  Give this guy a raise.  He took a couple of extra steps just to let me know, what’s up.   Thank you for hiring such great people.</Text>

WaveImaging was professional and had a clean office. The people that work here were kind and courteous. The ultrasound technician was very professional and nice. I would recommend this imagining center to anyone. Check in process was easy and I was able to fill out everything on my phone before I arrived. I was taken in promptly at my appointment time. Thank you.</Review>

< Review>
The staff for wave imaging were outstanding! Very courteous and on time. One thing is this facility is not easy to find. All you see outside the building is urgent care. There are no signs of wave imaging being here at all. Also, when you enter the building there is a small tiny sign if you can see it showing wave imaging in the urgent Care room. If you don't have a GPS good luck finding this place. The staff for urgent Care are obnoxiously loud. If you step into their lobby section, they will loudly let you know to move out and over to the other side of the room. Common courtesy would be to call you up to the window and let you know you're in the wrong section.<//Review>

I went for the first time to this location, I was extremely pleased it's modern and clean.
I went on a Wednesday morning and there was plenty of parking.
The young man at the front desk was very professional and courteous.  I  even complimented the young technician lady who did the ultrasound on my thyroid, for her professionalism, gentle touch, and pleasantness.  She didn't spill gel all over me as other operators have done in the past at other locations.

I certainly recommend this location and will to family and friends. I'm so glad I found this new location, I'm looking forward to come to this facility in the future.</Text>

Waste of time.
Customer service line is a nightmare - 45 min waits on hold. Gamel definitely doesn’t enjoy her job she should find a new one or not be so rude.
Zero availability for weeks. Just call somewhere else<//review>

The staff at waveimaging is excellent. Very considerate, nice, and caring. I had sonograms and xrays done on the same day. They were very efficient and worked through an issue that was caused by the scheduling personnel. Kudos to the staff at waveimaging. Hannah and Frank were awesome and worked as a team. Thank you.< /Text>

The young lady by that name is Sally, was very pleasant, curtious. To many people and she's the receptionist,gets your info, takes x Ray's. When we sign in there's no one to greet you or anything.  I don't thing this is the way Long Beach Memorial was.  Your going down hill.  I was there @ 1248. And I was not seen until 3pm.  This cannot be blame in the young lady.<//review>

After seeing my doctor, I stopped by memorial care imaging to get some work done.  The Young lady at the front desk was very helpful and accommodating since I had no appointment.  She quickly looked any available times and noted that there was an available time that same day.  She set me up and I was ready for my appointment.  Later, Renata was set to work on the imaging.  She was also very pleasant and made me feel relaxed the whole time.<//text>

<review>The only reason they are getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because they were late in taking me.  When I checked in at 8:40, as requested for a 9:00 appointment, they told me the technician was running late and it would be 9:15 to 9:20 before I would be seen and they did not update me further.  However it was 9.50 before I was called in.  That was 50 minutes late.  An update at 9:20 would have given them 5 stars. It would have shown me they were considerate of their patience’s time.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<time>1575158257268< /time><Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Check in was great.
Everyone was pleasant. The reason I gave it a 3 is because I think the PA ordered a non necessary x-ray.
But more importantly, the PA gave me a prescription that had side in it. On the forms I filled out,  it states I'm allergic to sulfa. Fortunately, I requested a paper prescription or I would not have had a prescription on pick up.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The environment and lobby was clean and inviting.   Nice seating and coffee while waiting.    Front desk lady was incredible and everything that a patient would hope and expect in the circumstances.  She was warm, friendly, efficient and engaging.  She had great patient care skills and made eye contact.  She made us feel comfortable and had a great attitude. In addition she was sweet but professional.  Xray tech was good and knew her job.    Didn't keep me waiting long.   All in all a good experience.  I would go again.</Review>

<review>Longer than anticipated wait time, however once in, she was professional, efficient, and had a great personality. Quite different than every other X-ray I’ve had from other locations before.

Pleasantly surprised. Was in and out in probably less than 15 minutes. Staff was very pleasant and effecient. Was very nice to be able to go in for x-rays on a weekend day. Will make an effort to come here next time I need xrays for sure.< /review>

<Review>Everyone was courteous and professional.
No wait time. I was informed ahead of time the amount of my copay. I dislike getting bills in the mail.
Facility is new and clean. Plenty of parking.
I would use this location for service again.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dd273381d64fed:0xde737756a23d134b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was asked to come in 20 - 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork.  I arrived 30 minutes early.  There was one person ahead of me.  I waited for almost one hour to be seen from the time of my appt.   The front desk office person was extremely helpful and nice.  I was told the person doing the ultrasound was filling in and running behind.  The ultrasound tech seemed very unsure of what she was doing.<//review>

Waited only a few minutes.  Technician was thorough.  It’s difficult to have any ultrasound because technician can never give you ay feedback but it’s a nice facility and efficient.</review>

I’ve been to the accompanying urgent care many times over the years but have never had to use the imaging center until today. Going from the room right to a changing area to the x-ray machine was very fast and convenient. The tech was able to get my images and have them ready quickly for the NP to review. Thank you.< /Review>

The doctors are very knowledgeable and take the time to listen to you.  They found something in my lungs that another urgent care I visited the day before did not see.  They can also do xrays on site.  I'm very pleased with this urgent care facility.</Review>

I will give them five star for talking and dragging about their service in one star for Service. I have been trying to make appointment for checking my pacemaker for the past 7months but they don't have a facility or the equipments to check my pacemaker you have to check my pacemaker every two years and is been passed the time and they cannot find Facility for me to do that follow up on my pacemaker and when I do any kinda of  bloodwork by primary physician i believe don't
Know how to use Computer system, I've been asking him for the past two weeks did you get my result is he was saying no so finally the 3rd before I asked the receptionist  about my results and was there.  I asked dr Keith my results he was saying let me check on the computer it was playing on the computer for at least five or 10 minutes he was saying no we have not received your results it I told him I spoke to one of your receptionist and she said that you guys have it.   He was so difficult and playing with the computer looking for results i just walked  out the office and I went to get the receptionist and got The results came back give to him and he was laughing at my face and saying oh I we have two different system in our office and with the receptionist and with the stupid smile on his face. I kept telling him they have it in the front desk but he was not listening to me and now he tells me all we have two different systems. and today I have emergency need to go see a doctor they don't have any kind of facility open and Irvine I'm not capable of driving so I have to go all the way to Irvine to fountain Valley I don't think this is at hospital this must be a communication facility of the nurses and doctors getting together.<//Text>

A lot of waiting and I thought the copayment was way to high. I really wish they would have used the sonogram on where the highest pain and pressure was located, but they did not complete that area. If they had scanned that area they may have found the problem I'm having.<//Review>

I must have had several ultrasounds done on different areas of my body within my lifetime... and this ultrasound I had done with, radiologist, Farima, was the most and only painful experience I’ve had for an ultrasound. I went in because I injured my right leg and the swelling on my knee down to my foot was swollen and my doctor wanted to rule out any blood clots. I went in and it took an hour and fifteen minutes for a routine ultrasound because she kept deleting and redoing it, she seemed new or just didn’t have enough training. I have a very high tolerance of pain and this ultrasound was so painful. Farima pressed down so hard onto my thigh and even started to squeeze my injured leg with her other hand, which didn’t have a glove on and even dug her nails into my skin. Regardless of the numerous times of telling her that i was in pain and to stop squeezing my legs she continued to do so and even asked for assistance from other nurses to squeeze my leg so she can free up her other hand. The two other nurses that came in were nice and actually cognizant and concerned with the pain in my leg. Farima was not. She compressed my leg harder than a deep tissue massage which I’m accustomed to as I go once a month to Massage Envy. Regardless of the bad experience here the lady at the front desk and the nurse that came in was actually nice, the only good thing about my visit.<//Text>
