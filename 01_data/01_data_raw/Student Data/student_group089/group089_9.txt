The owner is a great guy. Selection is amazing. If they don't have it they will get it for you. They are all about education to new Brewers as well as supporting seasoned Brewers.</text>

This is a really great, well-stocked homebrewing store in North County. I've been in three times now, and they always have what I need instead of having to wait for somewhere else to mail me an order. They're really friendly and knowledgeable and want to support you in your brewing. I can't recommend this awesome local supply store enough!<//Review>

I went to Carlsbad Brew Supply in order to exchange a CO2 cylinder. The shop is nestled in a nondescript Business Park, on the back side of one of the buildings. The shop requires that a ring a doorbell to get assistance. I appreciate that they take care to protect themselves and their customers during this time of covid-19 . The process of exchanging the cylinders was fast and easy and very reasonably priced. I will definitely return<//Text>

Super helpful and friendly! Very knowledgeable husband and wife partnership. Large selection of beer brewing supplies.

Father’s Day 2019, the owner Raul, spent over an hour helping me gather supplies for one of his in-house brew recipes, and answered all my newbie questions with patience. I can’t say enough about how great and welcoming this place is. Raul and his wife have a true passion for brewing and the brewing community. I won’t go anywhere else for my home brew needs. Thank you!</text>

Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Great place to ask questions if you are new to brewing or to swap secrets if you are experienced. The only downside is they are a little hard to find in that commercial park if you have never been there before.</review>

< Review>
Last week I went to Milan college and received a facial and wanted to go back for a Microdermabrasion as well as a chemical peel a week apart from each other. However, I just received a call from Erica at Milan college stating that the “instructor Lisa and the student Shelby” don’t feel comfortable with doing a facial because I have a bump on my forehead and needed a doctor's note in which I had enough time to get had I known I needed it. I want you to know I don’t have a problem with them not wanting to do the task at hand I understand that but canceling my appointment at the last minute, making two additional appointments as if everything was fine, and the instructor stating that she doesn’t feel comfortable with me having a facial without even seeing me so that she can evaluate what my skin condition is, is crazy! Who says no to something that they’ve never even seen themselves it sounds like incompetency to me as an instructor. By the way, why do we sign a consent form if we can’t have the work done? To the instructor LISA PLEASE WEAR YOUR FACE MASK PROPERLY! TY

<Text>As a former student, I think that this is one of the best options for those looking to enter the Cosmetology industry. The teachers are extremely supportive and knowledgeable and the staff and administration will go out of their way for you, if you actually care about your own success. Unlike other schools, the schedule is actually quite reasonable for the education that you receive ( I was able to work a part time job while attending last year) so you don't have to worry about sacrificing work for a higher education. They also do a fantastic job listening to the students concerns and doing their best to fix those concerns. Over all, every school will have its fair share of issues, but honestly most of the work is up to the student in the end.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>The school is so disorganized!!!! SO DISORGANIZED. The fact that we are constantly asking what assignments we have to do because the teacher doesn’t have it together is OVERWHELMING!!! Do not go to this school it’s a scam. The attendance is messed up. When they tell you if you miss 14 consecutive days they mean that literally. Weekends included even on days you don’t have class they count that against you attendance if you miss A day !!!! The teachers are under staffed and aren’t even trained on how to use most of this stuff. Wasn’t taught most of the things that were in the curriculum... And that’s not even the half of it. Save you money. Go to a different school. And if you know someone that is thinking about going to this school, please warn them. Literally you can learn this stuff off of YouTube and your better off on a online class. And these are cold facts.</Review>< Pictures>

<username>Fatima Parra</username><review>I am currently a student and oh my god... please let me save you the time and the money. DO NOT GO HERE. You are going to waste 10 grand just to essentially teach yourself. The students here have complained countless times that the teachers do not do their job. Majority of the time they arent even in the classroom. When we get our kits, some stuff would be missing and they never end up giving us those things and when we ask to receive that credit back, they blow it off. This school doesnt even get the right amount of funding to the point where the run out of PAPER TOWELS. This school is a joke, for real.

i wish i could give this school zero stars, i wasted an entire year of my life here and thousands of dollars. The teachers there are a joke and extremely unprofessional and unhelpful. The only teacher on the salon floor I felt like I could actually rely on was Mrs. Heidi, mostly because she's one of the only teachers to stick around. I would ask for help for things and was told countless times by the teachers they didn't know and a student would have to help me. I was cussed at multiple times by the teachers and was also told they were going bankrupt. There's absolutely no structure to the programs and they would change things all the time. NO CONSISTENCY. I consider myself a really good student and always try to strive to better myself and my future but this place makes it impossible. I always thought I had a passion for the cosmetic/beauty industry but this place makes me want nothing to do with it.< /review>

<text>So this is specific experience is directed to the student Tina Muha (pronounced MOO-UH if I spelled it incorrectly), I really hope you fulfill more training and classes or maybe just find another calling in life besides the beauty field because my experience with you was absolutely disappointing. First, you don’t even introduce yourself, or even give some kind of a friendly demeanor, you just say “you’re the one I’m working on right? Okay follow me.” Then, you proceed to tell me that you have not once cut bangs on someone before while giving a displeased grin when I continue to say it’s a trim all around but including the bangs. I wished you were honest with yourself and your current abilities to pass me off on someone who was a bit more experienced in this field, but since you’re learning i didn’t want to seem rude, cause hey, maybe you weren’t giving yourself enough credit... but I was wrong to give you that benefit of a doubt. Tina then proceeds to tell me “she’s just being honest about not ever doing what I’m specificity asking for in the first place.” Which raised my anxiety so far through the roof I was just praying she cut my hair somewhat decent in the end. And within the next 45 mins (yes, 45 mins for a straight edge trim, nothing fancy!) she will have proceed to cut my hair 2 inches when I only wanted 1/2-1 inch off, misplace her shears, drop multiple items from the counter to the floor, DIGGING the sectioning hair clip into my SCALP, and eventually LEAVING THE BUILDING CRYING because it’s taking too long for her and she “can’t right now”, then soaks my hair in water and walks me to the front of the building... with soaked hair that’s shorter then suppose to be. Needless to say I was not happy. I really hope you get ALOT more training on haircuts before you ever do another Tina, cause of all recent haircuts I’ve revived, you definitely were the worst one ever. The only way I’d ever come back to Milan would be if there is 100% guarantee that Tina will not be available to massacre my hair and scalp again.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

I wish I could give this facility zero stars but unfortunately I cannot. The massage program is a joke.  I went to receive a massage once and the students were EXTREMELY unprofessional.  I went again because I believe in second chances and scheduled for an 80 minute deep tissue massage for my birthday with a birthday discount.  Instead of the 80 minute deep tissue massage I received a 50 minute Swedish Massage.  The staff was completely rude so I payed and went on my way.  My mom (who paid for this massage for my birthday) was not happy that I paid for the wrong massage and called and spoke to a man who is the supervisor of the massage department. He told her since they messed up they would honor the massage and he would call me personally to schedule a FREE appointment since THEY messed up and in the computer it showed I was scheduled for the 80 minute deep tissue massage.  I NEVER received a phone call and when I called the secretaries told me all they could do was give me 50% off a $50.00 80 minute deep tissue massage, when I paid $35.00 for my last 80 minute deep tissue massage.  WHAT. A. RIP OFF.<//text>

<user_name>Dominique DeBenedetto<//user_name><Text>Forget getting to be able to work after you attend school.  I've been trying to get my license with the state since July 2016.  The CAMTC and the school are at fault. I've paid for everything and passed all my tests right away and I don't have a criminal record so there shouldnt be any hold up.  All I can say is go give your money to a state school and get a degree.  A career as a massage therapist isn't great anyways.  A lot of time and money wasted.  Oh and when I finished Milan's program they told me that only 1 in 5 massage therapist will be working after being out of school for 5 years.  Yeah, that's the statistic they share with you during your final hours there. What a joke it all is!</Text>< user>

I've been waiting for my hair to grow since then. The teacher was never around when the procedure was done and when I complained they said they couldn't do nothing not even offer to do a free hair treatment. If you're doing a chemical treatment don't go to a school<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Rarely have I encountered a medical office operated as beautifully as Skin and Beauty Center in Burbank.  The facility is simple, elegant and clean to the point of antiseptic - yet decorated in a way that makes it warm, relaxing, and inviting.  But the greatest assets are the people who work there - every single one is friendly, very professional, and incredibly efficient and skilled at their job.  You feel confident from the minute you walk in until the minute you walk out that you are respected and will be well taken care of.  This continues outside the office with smart, helpful digital reminders and information.  It's really impressive.  Dr. Payam Sadaat exemplifies all of this with his calm, compassionate, and expert care ... I have always had complete confidence in - and good results with - his treatments and pro-active care.  I highly recommend this practice for the rare confluence of excellence all around.</Text>< response>

<Review>I was supposed to see Dr. Vadmal Dermatologist. Instead I was set up an appointment with the other, very young, dermatologist also beginning with a V. I'm very frustrated after the fact because I don't feel I was seen by someone with enough know how and life experience as an actual medical professional. I am so sick and tired of these 20 somethings coming out and claiming to be experts with less than 5-10 years medical experience.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Date>1617075516036</Date><Review>So I've been affiliated with Skin and Beauty Center for five years now.
This organization has the most amazing, caring doctors and a truly wonderful staff. Recently I had an appointment with Dr. Charles Vainder for a cosmetic procedure.  This was the first time we met.  Let me tell you he is the sweetest, most patient, kind and caring individual.  He listened to what my concerns were.  He was very positive and had an uplifting personality.

Dr. Vainder made me feel good about myself before even doing the procedure, which only validated that I was in the right place.  He took his time to give me perfect results and he was so gentle.  As someone in the medical field herself, I would highly recommend you visiting Dr. Vainder for your dermatological concerns.  I trusted him and you should too.

Thanks Dr.  Vainder!  I'm very happy with your work.

Dr. Vadmal and staff always treat me with courtesy and explain procedures and prescriptions with detail.

The administrative and medical staff all practice excellent Covid social distancing, all wear masks and make sure you are treated within the proper guidelines.

Thank you.</Text>

< Review>
As a patient at Skin and Beauty Center for more than eight years, I’ve always been impressed with the professionalism and patient-centered care I’ve received. Because I’m fair-skinned (and spent too many years on beaches, I guess), I do have issues that need to be dealt with periodically, and I’ve always come away satisfied with treatments and outcomes. As for cosmetic treatments, they certainly offer a wide variety but there are no hard-sells. If one is interested, they tell you the pros and cons, and never steer you needlessly toward anything more expensive or time-consuming. In particular Dr Saadat is excellent: he listens, he focuses on the issues at hand, and whatever the intervention, it’s explained, it’s done quickly and painlessly and whatever is the follow-up is spelled out clearly. Very reassuring. I always come away reassured I’ve done the right thing.<//Review>

Let me tell you, they are GREAT! The doctors, the assistants, and the entire staff are dynamite!
I went in hoping to cure some redness and acne on my mug and Dr. Saadat diagnosed me with rosaesa. (Thank god, cause I thought I was going through second puberty.... and I couldn’t go through that again!)
Anyhoo, Doc put me on some medications and low and behold I went from looking like George Burns to looking like George Clooney! (and that’s no easy feat, because I normally look like a gremlin).
Doc also noticed a little cancer in the side of my face and he removed it right away. (No scars!)
So, in closing, and on a serious note, I highly recommend the Skin and Beauty Center (and esp. Doc Saadat). These fine people know what they’re doing.

< Review>
Unfortunately, I regret coming here. I can’t speak to their aesthetic procedures, but I would not recommend them for medical concerns. My doctor felt dismissive and rushed. When I came back for my follow up appointment, reporting no improvement to my symptoms despite strictly following her treatment plan, the doctor said this was as good as it was going to get. She didnt take the time to suggest other options. I left feeling disheartened. I absolutely wasted my time and money at this office.<//Review>

The Skin and Beauty Center in Burbank is a great place to heve your needs to be taken care of. The Staff is great and Dr. Vadmal is fantastic. Their online reservation system is easy to use. I recommend Dr. Vadmal without reservation to anyone for his or her dermatological needs.< /text>

<Text>This was my husbands first visit to this office. Getting an appointment was very easy.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I like that you can register your appointment on line and save time when you arrive for your first appointment.  Wait time was not a problem.  My husband saw Dr. Ava, who we were both impressed with.  She made the visit relaxing, while explaining what issue he had and what procedure she would be doing.  She took her time and answered whatever questions we had. We were in and out very quickly.  It says a lot about a doctor when you look forward to going to them.  We would recommend this office for any dermatology issues.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Friendly front office and nurses.
The physicians assistant had a great bedside manner. Everthing that was done was explained in advance and thoroughly. Questions were answered happily.  I hate the whole "going to the Dr" deal, but this was definitely a good experience . a+< /text>

Dr. Saadat is the finest. He has the caring attitude and listening skills of an old world physician and his acute medical skills provide precise corrections to what the patient is seeking.  I have gone to him for years and frankly travel from the East coast to have his skilled hands and eyes. My face and my heart thank him.< /Text>

Its a trap, waste of money. These people who call themselves a dermatologists have no experience and zero understanding about skin health / treatment. On the phone They told me they will treat my wart with the laser. I went there, paid for a consultation and then found out that they don’t treat warts with the laser. Instead they just applied some useless liquid and gave me a bandaid. Waste my time, money and trust. Don’t go there. Instead find a real doctors in real hospital.< /Text>

<username>Janet Myerberg</username><Review>I had a mole removed from my back by Dr. Saadat and everything seemed to be fine until about a week ago when I noticed another mole growing in the same location. I live two hours out of town and my husband had an appointment a week from the day I'm writing this post. I tried to make an appointment for the same time because of the distance and I would be with my husband anyway. I was told I could NOT be accommodated because THREE other people had the same day and time as my husband. REALLY? I was told I could come the next day, again, REALLY? I just said I live at least 2 hours away depending on traffic going into LA. I was pleased with what Dr. Saadat did but the staff needs lessons on customer service.< /Review>< user_id>

My experience was most unfortunate.  The doctor made me feel foolish for asking questions and was quick to write me 4 prescriptions and shoo me out the door.  It felt like a cattle call, one size fits all...no personal interest.<//Review>

I love Dr Vadmal. I have been goin to him over 5 years. He is patient, caring and kind. The nursing staff are knowledgeable and efficient while being friendly. The manager Corrine is a blessing and much appreciated. Although it can be busy, the front desk seems to run so much smoother and staff seem calmer. All in All, a great place.   signed s.m.</review>

Horrible experience.  For the 3rd and final time!  I had an appt. this morning at 9:45AM, they took 2 patients in that had 10AM appts. before me.  Now it's 10:30AM and I ask how much longer...another 30 minutes!  Are you kidding me?  My time is just as valuable as theirs.  Another woman heard me and she too had an appt. with Dr. Ava, and she heard my complaints and she and I both walked out of there!  Please DO NOT waste your time going to this office.  Really BAD!!!< /Text>

Commendation for Dr. Manjunath Vadmal

Dr. Vadmal MD. PhD. has been my dermatologist of long standing and whom I see four times a year for regular check ups. My recent visit was once again an occasion for complete satisfaction for (1) the highly skilled care which Dr. Vadmal rendered to me, along with (2) the outstanding courteous service provided by the entire Skin and Beauty Center staff of well trained nursed, medical assistants, and the attendants who take care of the checking in process, insurance matters, payments and scheduling.

Dr. Vadmal's clinical diagnoses, evaluations, assessments and treatments are grounded and informed by an outstanding educational background in the life sciences augmented by continuous ongoing study and a broad and extensive practical knowledge and skill in surgical techniques. Dr. Vadmal brings to the care of each of his patients an empathetic understanding of their personal concerns about their health; his calm and collected state of being, gentle strength and soft spoken manner provides reassurance, and is conducive for the alleviation anxiety and apprehensiveness that patients may have as regards their conditions and curative medical procedures.

I recommend Dr, Vadmal without reservation to anyone who is seeking to receive the very finest professional care for their dermatological needs and the achievement and maintenance of optimal health for their skin.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>I cannot explain to anyone how much Dr. Saadat has helped me. I've had acne my whole life... I came to him in desperation after seeing so many other doctors that didn't help. I wanted to go on accutane (anything that was strong enough to work!) Dr. Saadat wanted to go about it the more conservative and healthy way and he was 100% correct in his decision. My acne has cleared and it only took a couple months to see the finished product. I am so thankful for his patience and continued diagnosis.

I also couldn't be more thankful for Land who is always there to answer any question on mine!! I've emailed him a couple times for just quick answers when I couldn't come and see the doctor and he's been unbelievably helpful. I love this office and they really should be acknowledged for all their efforts. Thank you!!!<//Text></record>

<Text>Dr. Vadmal is amazing. I'm a geezer, and because skin cancer runs in my family and melanoma took my grandfather's life, I take regular skin checks very seriously. I'm a Washington DC native, and had some great doctors there before moving to LA in 2009, but even the best doctors in DC never came close to the caliber of Dr. Vadmal. He really knows his stuff, and does a thorough body exam efficiently and carefully. I've had several basal cell carcinomas removed over the past few decades. But Dr. Vadmal is great at recognizing and catching them in the pre-cancerous stage and getting them in advance. Dr. Vadmal's biopsies as well as his surgeries have been remarkably less painful than those I had done by previous doctors. In addition to his excellence in his field, he's a terrific people person (although soft-spoken) and genuinely cares about patients. Once, when I had to use a prescription cream on my face and accidentally put on the whole tube rather than 1/3 as prescribed, I called and got his phone service at 10 pm on a Friday night. I explained the situation and she said she would get Dr. V on the phone. "NO!" I said, don't bother him this late on a Friday night, just give him the message tomorrow in case there's anything I should do over the weekend". She replied, "sorry m'am, but I know this doctor and I know he's going to want to speak with you". He came on the line about 45 seconds later. Everything was fine. But I was amazed at his determination to put his patients first. Heads up: this office has lots of patients, and they definitely give each patient all the time each patient needs. I see that as a positive. But bring something with you to read or work on, because you're not always called in immediately. Longest I ever had to wait was 35 minutes. Also, I've never seen any doctor in this practice other than Dr. Vadmal.</Text>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) I loved the treatment of the secretaries and nurses, see Dr. Ava col. I was diagnosed with broken glasses knotted on the chin.
I had about a month with the problem, no dr wanted to see me because they thought it was skin cancer.
It started as a stain and then it started to grow like a fungus, it gave me a lot of itching, it fell from an accident and I bled too much, on the day of the appointment I almost didn't bleed anymore, the Dra slept the area and burned the capillary veins, it was very attentive.
As I pay in cash I only charge half the cure.

(Original)
Me encanto el trato de las secretarías y enfermeras, consulte col la Dra Ava. Me diagnosticó unos vasos rotos hechos nudos,  en la barbilla.
Ya tenía como un mes con el problema, ningún dr me quiso atender porque pensaban que era cancer de piel.
Empezó como una mancha y luego empezó a crecer como un hongo, me daba mucha comezón, se cayo x accidente y me sangraba demasiado, el día de la cita ya casi no sangraba, la Dra me durmió el area y quemo  las venas capilares, fue muy atenta.
Como pague en efectivo me cobro solo la mitad x la curación.<//review>

<Review>I haven't been here in years because I moved away. I scheduled an appointment for today at 1:30 for me and my mom for two full sets and a pedicure. We are extremely satisfied with the results. Helen did a great job on my nails, and I love the color. It was color 591, it's like a light pink and chrome color. The lady that give me a pedicure was really good, I forget her name but it's the lady that works next to Helen's station. They're super nice and reasonably price. I will definitely come back again.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

First time here...Really good service. They have many gel Colors and everyone is really nice. I choose not to get acrylic nails...just gel on my nails and I am impressed how 3 weeks later its still looking presentable. Also had a pedicure and the lady gave me an Amazing foot massage 😍. Its far from my house but because of the great service and not feeling rushed I will be back.<//review>

<Review>I started going here and it's been couple years. During pandemic they shut down until the county opened couple months back this year and I went for my first manicure and pedicure. They followed all the protocol health safety measures with the clients and it was easy and for payments sometime they ask for cash but for people like me who doesn't carry cash venmo is another mode to pay. You should ask for it and it's really easy to pay. The owner lady is very sweet and comes and check with you if everything is okay!<//Review>< Pictures>

I was respectful because I thought she was on the phone but she wasn’t and was pretending to be on it. Rolled her eyes to help me. Used poor quality nail polish and tried to play it off. Told her to correct it and she was purposely messing up my nails on purpose and left nail polish on my hands after she said she was done. I washed my hands and there was still nail polish.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I asked for mid oval nails, but the shape I got is very weird. My nails look horrible right now. It’s not what I asked for. I don’t think she quite understood what I wanted. I hope they listen to the customer and pay more attention to what they want. I even showed her the picture of what shape I wanted. She did a horrible job on my nails.</review>

Cindy is the best!!  Even if you don't really know what design you want, if you leave it up to her,  you'll never go wrong.... just tell her what color,  shape or show her a pic. It's that simple!<//review>

The service was horrible , manicurist only removed a bit of cuticle than proceeded by applying gel polish which started peeling of two days of service . I didn’t get the full manicure treat and there polish is garbage. My first and last time going to Helens.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Review>The place is cute and great but I went in to get acrylic nails for the first time in months and they over charged me way too much, just for a simple color that wasn't gel or anything. It charged me $40 something just to get plain non gel nails. Not worth it at all and a waist of money for me.< /Review>< Rate>

Friendly nail techs! They are open 7 days a week until 7pm! My gel nails last 3-4 weeks. Drop in is great if you don't mind who does your nails but make an appointment if you want A specific tech.</Text>

I love this nail shop ! My nails get done by Helen herself 👍🏽🤗 the best !! I leave with my nails looking beautiful and  I feel fancy  too lol 😂 yes I do!  I've been to a lot of shops from Oakland to Fremont and some are good but most of the the time it's a hit or miss uuugh ....I don't have time for that ! Love ❤️ Helen's professional attitude and how she takes time to make sure everything is done ✅ right!!! Thanks 🙏🏻 Helen ! From auntie 💁🏽<//Review>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I usually use to go here and sometimes they had long waiting lines but today the guy in the front who is always there had such a bad attitude and I brushed it off because I thought maybe he was having a bad day but when I was picking out a color for the pedicure I opened the bottle of nail polish just to see if it was that dark and he snatched it out of my hands and embarrassed me. Then they finally sat me down and after 30 minutes I left, there was no service nothing and they were rude. No one needs that.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

My guess for one of Top 3 California RV repair shops & storage facility in California. Family owned. Huge outdoor storage with limited inside covered storage.< /text>

<Review>Leale's is the only service center that touches our RV, car, and truck. When you fine a good shop, that does excellent work, you become a loyal customer. A rare 5 of 5 rating reserved for the very best.</Review>< rating>

<Review>I had an accident that damaged both my slide in camper and truck, 2016 F-250. I was recommended to Leales’ RV in San Jose. My service rep was Cory.
They did a perfect job, this was my new camper and my latest truck.
Additionally I backed my trailer into my bed !
Again Cory and Leale’s did an excellent job.
I can highly recommend them.

Great service, reasonable prices, and found a mechanic that is knowledgeable and helpful!  Unlike big motorcycle shops, actually get to talk to the mechanic, and prices far more reasonable as well!<//text>

The quality of the service here exceeded my expectations. My husband and I wanted some extra table space in our RV, so instead of using the one table in the center of our seating area, we bought two Lagun legs and had Leale's install them. The quality of the workmanship is outstanding. They had to put some spacers between the mounting bracket and the cabinets. They cut the spacers to align with the mounting brackets and used wood so we can stain it to match the cabinets. Kory went out of his way to make sure the job was done right. I'm so pleased with the results! I will definitely come here again the next time I need any work done on our RV.<//Text>

<review>Recently was in SJ to visit my kids and one of my jacks on 2017 grand design reflection fifth wheel broke. I could not find any mobile repair and all shops were booked up 2 wks +. So I took out the jack myself and brought it to Leale's so that I could get it replaced through my extended warranty. Unfortunately, my warranty will not cover any part without labor. I was pretty mad. The service manager was very helpful and figured a way to get it done. Even though they do not do mobile repair, they did it for me and made it possible for it to get mostly paid for by warranty. Forgive my memory but I can not remember his name. I am very grateful for him and Leale's for getting me back on the road again. Advise anyone in the area that needs work to get it done here.

My husband and I own an RV rental company and we have been using Leale's services over the past 8 months and couldn't be happier. We have had an amazing experience with every staff member at Leale's,  from the technician to the supervisor to the owner of the business. Being RV amateurs with very limited know-how, we are really grateful to all the lovely folks there, who have always taken the time to work through various challenges with us, which has helped us tremendously in learning the intricacies of and operating  the RV business. They have a dedicated team of extremely knowledgeable and friendly professionals who are always ready to help and provide the best services because they are willing to.understand our needs and most importantly,  because they truly care. A special shoutout to Savvio  who has been a great friend, philosopher and guide! We would recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat!< /Text>

Savio was our Service Manager, and was exceptional at keeping us informed about the progress as well as what our options were to repair or replace various components.  The entire team provided us with first class service, and we couldn’t have been happier.  When we needed some follow up to fine tune some of the suspension work, the Leale’s team worked quickly to make everything right.  They went above and beyond in ensuring the RV was safe, our experience with them was positive, we were kept informed throughout the process, and provided us with some great new opportunities to visit!  Thanks to Savio and the entire team - true professionals!</review>< pictures>

I had some work here done on an insurance claim.  They did a great job.   Then I asked why my batteries kept draining when the vehicle was stored.  They said they replaced some wires,  I paid for the work,  yet the problem kept happening.  I took it back 2 more times.  I ended up paying $350 for them to find out I had my inverter set to a.c. power and was draining the batteries.  I'm not even sure if they ever did replace any wires.<//text>

If you need any type of RV service, Leale's is the place to bring your rig. They are in constant contact with you during your service. They address all the needs that you may have. Instead of driving our rig to Davis, for the maintenance and service required, we found Leale's. Everyone there is knowledgeable and courteous. Most important they get the job done, quickly and make sure that all everything is 100% before you leave. I recommend Leale's to anyone that ever asks who I take our RV to. Keep up the GREAT work.<//Review>

Family took RV to this shop for a list of services before our big trip. We were recommended. They are so professional lots of knowledge and they finished all that work ahead of schedule! They also took the time to explain things to us. RV shops tend not to be professional and you have to wait weeks for an appointment and more weeks to get the work done just to get sloppy workmanship. Leales did a great job I recommended them<//Review>

<Text>Broken down on the side of the road with an expensive tow ahead of us on a Saturday morning was a real problem. Who to call?  The travel gods were good to us when we contacted Leale’s in San Jose.  They took us in and treated us like family even though they had a full repair schedule.  Their technicians were highly competent and very well trained.  Our safety was their number one concern.  When we got back on the road we knew that we had put our RV in good hands. Their prices were fair and the job was first class.</Text>< pics>

<review>If you need to have your RV fix or check I highly recommend Leale’s RV and Truck Center. Brought my RV here to have it checked since I do not know what’s wrong with it. They were able to find the problem right away and had it fixed for me for an affordable price. I was impressed on how great their facility and how friendly the people are.  I was very satisfied.< /review>< Response>

This is not only the finest RV service center I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with, it is one of the few businesses left that actually still values the customer and places customer service, satisfaction first and works with the customer to find solutions that fit both the customers needs, as well as budget. These folks rock!<//Text>< Pics>

Had a fantastic experience here with some suspension upgrades on my new RV. The whole team worked with me and my schedule, got the job done under the estimate and faster than promised. What more could you ask for? Would not hesitate to use them again, although hopefully I won't need more service anytime soon.< /review>

<Review>nice new location, excellent service. went to Leale's for an RV that wouldn't start. Since this is a Class C, I had called the Chassis manufacturer's 2 service centers prior, both told me they would work on the unit. Leale's told me to bring it in and they had no problem looking at the chassis. They diagnosed the problem quickly and fixed it within a few days. Thanks from a repeat customer.< /Review>< user>

<Text>This is my first experience at Leale's.  They corrected some not-so-good work done at previos place, and right off I got the impression that this is a shop that will always stick with the best solution.  That may not be the cheapest in the short run, but it is in the long run. They did a thorough annual, and rotated & balanced tires. They immediately saw what could be done to improve my RV's suspension, and they quickly determined the exact correct parts to order. IMHO they really know what they are doing, so I feel confident that I am not just throwing money at the problem.  Looking forward to the improvement.  The shop is big, the personnel friendly, and I get the impression that the business is well-run.  Paperwork provided for this first bit of work at Leale's was very complete and organized.  So far so good with my experience at Leale's.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Friendly, helpful.  Fixed my motorhome problem.  Pointed out potential issues that may need attention, but didn't pressure me.  I asked them to check something that I wasn't sure was broken.  They said it was OK and didn't invent a new problem just to sell me a part.<//Review>

I called them to get a quote to remedy an electrical problem and to quote a price to install a roof rack. Of course they needed to see the trailer and I dropped it off on a Sunday. Within a few days I returned to talk to them about the rack placement, but still no quote, because they said they've never done it before...I should have taken my trailer and left. On Thursday I was told I would get a quote before any work was done, but no call and by Monday they said it was done and a price that was much more than expected. WHAT?!?! They reduced it a little, but at pick-up, not even a walk-through, or the courtesy of assisting to make sure all lights work. Now our outlets don't work, and after 2 days nothing works even with our battery at 75%, on top of that there are bot footprints on the ceiling (inside) of our canvas.<//text>

Escondido Auto Pros are the best. If you have a hybrid, these guys do fantastic work for a fraction of the cost. If you aren't taking your hybrid to them, you're losing money and missing out on their great service. I've got over 200k miles on my Prius. With EAP I'm going to get another 200k out of it.</text>

<review>It’s really hard to find a good quality mechanic that you can trust with your car. My Rav-4 needed serious help :( This is the 3rd time with them and I’ve had positive experiences every time! Oscar and David are great with communicating the cars issues and maintenance it might need. I started a maintenance plan and now drive worry free! At least I don’t have to look for a real mechanic if I have any issues. I tried my luck with older and cheaper places, even mobile mechanics.. No thank you!! These guys take the time and do the job right!< /review>< user_id>

They are the Best auto repair shop I have ever worked with. Their customer service is amazing. Alan that works there is extremely thorough and very helpful.  He made sure all my expectations were met . He made sure all repairs were done on time . He even helped provide a ride for me. I've had many different repairs done on my cars and will never go anywhere else. They really know what they are doing when it comes to hybrids. Thanks to your entire team. You are top notch.</text>

<review>I was fortunate to find this great place. The customer service is outstanding, I was helped by David at the beginning and Oscar at the end. Oscar explained me in detail everything my car had and what they were doing. My car stayed for less than a week, and now drives like new.  Thank you for all your kindness, dedication and excellence, I truly appreciate the level of service, before choosing Esconddo Auto Pros, I called many places and this place seemed to be the best choice in everything and I'm very glad I trusted my car here, it was totally worth it  ... :))))<//review><user_id>110687254856597087141</user_id><Name>Claudia Tapia<//Name><Resp>None</Resp></record>

<Review>I chose a hybrid vehicle because I care about the environment...what I didn't realize was hybrid batteries are costly, a headache and can go out on you at a moments notice...Enter Escondido Auto Pros!
James the mechanic and owner was kind enough to look after my vehicle after ordering the parts.  Especially being a women, several other shops try to take advantage of me but James company was honest, earnest, kind and patient.  They fixed it immediately and Im looking forward to pick it up tomorrow!  He even updated me on what needs to be fixed next, AND printed the car fax report of the history...Im so thankful good people STILL exist.  Thank you God!  (Also he honors military service )
Thank you James and his team for reminding me that there is still good out there in the world.  Just in time for me to drive and see my family in San Francisco <3

I took my truck there for an oil change and inspection for what else may need to be done. They listed a coolant flush, but this was just done in March so I knew it wasn't needed. I opted to take my truck to get a second opinion.  The second place was cheaper on every service, more personable then the guy at Auto pros and let me speak directly to the mechanic who was going to do the work. The kicker was, I paid for 8 qts of oil, I literally picked my truck up and drove 1.5 miles down the street to Performance Auto Care and the mechanic showed me that Auto Pros shorted me 1qt of oil. Performance Auto also did not tell me I needed a coolant flush and when I asked they double checked to make sure they didn"t miss it but called me back saying no they don't think it is needed, which built my trust in them.  I will take my cars to Performance Auto Care now.

Also, I wouldnt have left this review if I wasnt getting multiple text messages a day to leave one about how "happy" I am of their work. So here you go Escondido Auto Pros, now please stop texting me.< /Text>

<Review>A+ for esco auto pro's! They are the only ones with trust outside of the dealership with our hybrid cars. Oscar was a great help, and was even willing to let us pick up our vehicle after hours when we couldn't make it before close. They are professional and courteous and offer a great value on hard to find services. We will definitely be back!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

I was going to buy a car but wanted to be sure that it was in good shape before doing that so I had EAPros do an inspection and WOW was it thorough. There were pics taken, and a full written report of their findings. Even the seller of the vehicle was impressed with how thorough the inspection was. Aside from the 12v battery there was nothing wrong with the vehicle but the 60k mile service was due so we had EAPros bring it all up to par and everything went off without a hitch. I was even able to get a dent removal company to come out to EAPros to get rid of some dents on my soon to be purchased car. He was GREAT too, if you need the info to THAT guy just ask the staff at EAPros they’ll take good care if you. These guys are awesome, I just wish they would have a shop here where I live. (Vegas) Hard to find an auto shop that won’t take you for a ride. Thorough and fair, that’s all shops need to be and yalls in Eacondido are lucky to have both of those qualities (and more) at Escondido Auto Pros. Thank you to the staff at EAPros!</review>

Not many places will go the extra mile to troubleshoot your problems. I had my car at 3 other shops that couldn’t figure it out but I took it to these guys and gave them some time with it. A week later I’m back on the road w my check engine light gone! Always professional and friendly when I spoke with them through the whole process. The shop is super busy all the time which is a great sign. People know these guys are good and that’s why they come here!<//Text>

<review>I came here for a fixing a battery failure. Well, after taking back few weeks, things went wrong again. But they really reasonable, and stand behind their work. The only problem is that I have to drive far to their location to get it fixed, but they would honor the warranty without any issues. After few trial & errors (things failed multiple times), they volunteer to extend the warranty for me also. So I think that's some workmanship and reliability customer need especially when they're handling with old cars and in need of a reliable mechanical shop.<//review><gmapID>0x80dbf4baea4fe22d:0x59885001827d1296</gmapID><UserId.>102518519064931619106< /UserId.>< username>

Oscar is awesome and very knowledgeable about the trade. The mechanics always inform you before doing work and performs the maintenance in a timely manner. I drive 45 mins just to come here because of their customer service and experience.

It’s good to see the same mechanics every time I visit. This shows they take care of their employees and have a great work environment.< /Review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>My Prius hybrid battery needed replacing after 180,000 miles, so I came to Escondido Auto Pros to take advantage of their great price hybrid refurbished battery -
Well, it only lasted 50,000 miles and they said it's dead and I need a new one!
The owner said, "hey 50,000 miles isn't bad- remember it's a refurbished battery" -
So, in conclusion, I wanted to share my experiences, incase it helps anyone: Your cost would be $2,000 for this refurbished battery to last 50k miles.
I wish I would have known this hybrid battery was only going to last 50k miles while the Toyota hybrid battery seems to last a minimum of 150k miles.
Choosing Escondido Auto Pros for the hybrid battery replacement ended up being the wrong choice.<//Text>< Pics>

It did what it was supposed to, which is last 3-4 Years and 50K miles. To be fair, please explain how a Toyota $3000 battery with 1-year warranty compares to an EAP $2000 Battery 5 Year Pro Warranty. What you meant was you made a mistake by getting a reconditioned battery not an EAP battery which is a high quality reconditioned battery. Also, we have brand new battery options with unlimited mileage for customers that choose that route.'}< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf4baea4fe22d:0x59885001827d1296< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Worst customer service I have experiences in a repair shop. Couldn't even get a mechanics work notes on a hybrid inspection. Manager fought with me over the phone on his inability of being able to email a file to me with the work order. I would urge you to keep looking for a better shop. We wouldn't never do business with this company again.<//Text>

Service is always outstanding and the costs are very reasonable. Communications is very good; I always know what is happening real time and they go out of their way to keep you up-to-date on what they find during their servicing...and I have never been surprised later...as some businesses do. Bottom line is that they do great work and I trust them! I will gladly be back to handle my service needs in the future.</review>

These guys went above and beyond to help me when my brakes failed on my RV. It was a Sunday and my brakes failed on the 78 freeway approaching the 15 - smoke was pouring from the front wheels so I limped into the premises of Escondido Auto-pros. They were closed of course but there was one of their staff members present who allowed me to park the RV in their space until Monday morning. When Monday came around John prioritized my repairs as he could see I was stuck and on vacation - his team worked for 2 days which ended up requiring a complete replacement of brakes, rotors, drums etc on all 4 wheels. Service was tops and price reasonable. I would not hesitate to go back there again - a really good experience.<//Text>

Long story short ...I made the mistake of going with a an online company for a cheaper hybrid battery option for my Prius. Well that was a mistake! I went with a brand new battery this time. In and out in a day as promised. Great service from the pros!< /text>

30K service.Good communication. Appreciate the emailed inspection to review and attached photos of vehicle condition. Also, the repair videos make for a complete customer information package.
Would recommend welcoming chairs in the check-in room if one needs to wait while their car is being worked on. Currently need to sit on the curb outside. Easy fix.</Review>

I had to have my brakes repaired.  They did an inspection, for free as I knew they needed to be replaced anyway, and then completed the repairs quickly and efficiently.  The price was very reasonable, and the service was outstanding.  There was no "talking down" to me, making me feel like I was not knowledgeable about my vehicle like so many other shops.  I enjoyed the experience and will certainly be back when my vehicle needs a repair.< /review>

I brought my car here for repair a few months ago and could not be happier.  The pricing was fair and the service man who did the work was friendly.  I was able to go into the garage and see exactly what work was being done and what each component would cost.  The desk person wrote up a formal quote that included all of the work and the add-ons and non-essential items, which was a big help in determining what exactly I would move forward with.  This place is fair, and does great work.  Highly recommend.<//Text>

Their work hours are ideal, providing service on both SAT & SUN which is highly unusual. My scheduled appointment was at 7am on Saturday. My vehicle needed an oil change, fuel induction service & an inspection overall. I was kept apprised of findings, recommendations were given & all service was provided at a reasonable price. I was given every consideration when additional services needed to be performed & an explanation about the pros & cons of repairs was given. All work was completed in a reasonable amount of time. I was even entrusted a loaner vehicle to return home while services were being performed at no additional cost.. I was relieved to learn that my vehicle is in very good condition & informed that the upkeep & maintenance of my vehicle is worth the investment. The genuine courtesy & professionalism demonstrated by Dave is invaluable. I am so glad they remain in business after taking over Cal's Auto Pros; The quality & integrity of their business carries on.< /Text>< Pics>

Great local shop. I came in for an oil change and a brake noise and they checked it out within a few hours and emailed me a nice inspection report showing exactly what was wrong with the brakes. It made it easy for me to feel comfortable going forward with the brake repairs on my Toyota since they were able to sow me the problem in such detail. The brakes are great now. No more noises.<//text>

I have been taking my cars to Tim (the owner) for years and he has always done a great job. I brought my van in for brakes the other day and was really impressed with the detailed inspection report (with pictures) that they emailed me. The report outlined what repairs were critical, what could wait and what was in good shape. Their prices are very reasonable. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The waiting room is comfortable with tv and coffee.  FYI-The shop is located in the back side of the building.</Text>

{'time': 1550955223355, 'text': "Hello Avery. You fail to mention that you never listened to us when we told you how to properly repair your vehicle. We've already spoken plenty of times about your issues. You want us to fix one repair at a time and don't understand that the route you take is your own fault. Please don't come to our site with your false claims. You weren't lied to about the loaner car, it was there but already spoken for by another customer. You were a loyal customer for 2 years and your 160K mile Lexus had issues you didn't want to fix. You spent about $700 with us, so no you never spent $5000 on anything. You barely wanted to spend $300 to fix your failed fuel pump but then didn't want to replace your clogged up fuel filter. Even after your issues we still tried to help you. It seems like you have your own issues that we can't fix. We hope you can find a shop that can work with you. Good luck to you sir. EAP."}</Resp>
< text>
Don't trust these guys! I spent over $5k for repairs and till this day, my car is not 100% repaired. They keep telling me it's something different every time and want me to bring it back to look at. But why would I do so if I'll be spending more $ when they couldn't pinpoint or repair the problem the 1st time??? They say they honor warranty but when they fix my brakes last time, they supposedly said it was fixed and now they say it's something different. I don't TRUST them because I've been lied to about the loaner car being available for use. Also, after picking up my car....3 hrs later, my car broke down and they said it was the gas tank was empty when my gas light just came on and the car had 16 miles left.
It's just a NIGHTMARE with these guys!!!</text>

Great place.  My wife was on a road trip and broke down on the highway.  Had it towed to these guys because they had good reviews.  David the manager took really good care of her and the car. He even emailed me pictures and a detailed report of what was wrong.  The price was fair especially since they have a 2 year nationwide warranty. Thanks.</review>

The guys at Escondido Auto Pros are not only really nice, but they are really good at what they do. They diagnose problems quickly, and fix them just as fast. They have been nothing but courteous and helpful each time that I have had my car in for service. They always go above and beyond to make sure that I am happy, and that my car is in top shape when I leave. It is hard to find a shop that you can trust, and are highly qualified. Thank you to Tim, John and all the guys at EAP.</Text>

SCAMMERS! This shop is NOT to be trusted. Had a diagnosis done on my 2008 ford escape and was told a replacement transmission would need to be installed at a cost of $3300. This was nearly 2x what other shops wanted when I called around. I had another shop take care of the swap to find out that was not the issue at all. When I called them out on it their excuse was that was what the manual said. Im sure the first course of action is NOT to replace the transmission but further diagnosis.  They will find an excuse to charge you for the most expensive repairs possible and it wont even be the issue. There are many other reputable shops to take your car to. DONT make the same stake I did.</text>

You brought your car in for a diagnosis and took it to another shop to repair or repair it yourself. Why would another shop replace the transmission if it wasn\'t the problem? Did they not know what to do? Maybe you told them how to fix it? Did they do a proper diagnosis?  We don\'t know if you received poor work on your vehicle or did it yourself. So who\'s to blame? Every-time we have a customer who tries to "handle" the repair they end up blaming us because their issues aren\'t solved. Well we solve 99.9% of our customers vehicles issues. If we did replace the transmission and that wasn\'t the issue, you wouldn\'t have paid for the repair and you would have a running vehicle. We have the most honest shop you\'ll find and we always do right by our customers. Hopefully you learned a lesson here and instead of trying to save a buck you\'d let professionals handle the job.'}</response>< Rating>

Escondido Auto Pros is the only shop Ill take my family's vehicles to.  They provide SUPERIOR service at very fair prices.  You can count on an HONEST diagnosis at Esco Auto Pros.  They have top of the industry, ASE mechanics, as well as top notch technology that can illustrate to you exactly what is wrong with your vehicle (VERY COOL).  Paul is extremely knowledgeable and is someone you can trust.

Esco Auto Pros are the INDUSTRY LEADERS in the Auto Repair world!  If you go anywhere else, you are missing out.  Do yourself a favor and try these guys out!<//review>

<userid>110116110633615826358</userid><Text>I live in OC and drove over 50 miles to save $1K on my hybrid battery over the dealer price for my 2005 Prius. Escondido Auto Pros were accurate in their estimate, they were polite, had coffee, water, wifi, and more with the savings and the warranty on the battery (way better than the Toyota dealer.) They had a little electric car I could use to run errands and grab lunch. This was worth the trip, and the service there made it so much more convenient than the regular trip to the dealer for service!< /Text></record>

< Review>
I just found my new auto mechanic shop in escondido. I called them about lexus repair prices and they took the time to explain in detail why price isnt the only concern when getting my car fixed. Long story short... I brought my car in so they could look at it and they definitely impressed me with their professional employees and straight up  customer service. I will definitely bring it back once I can afford to have it fixed. They have the nicest little lobby too for a car shop..</Review>

So far, so good. I've used this shop twice now and received courteous, professional service. I like that I was shown images of the parts that needed replacement. Today I was given a loaner. It was quick and painless to do the dropoff and pickup. Wi-Fi is available if you're having something small like a smog check and you want to hang out there. They treat you as though your time is valuable...which of course, it is! You can probably find a cheaper shop, but you won't get Wi-Fi or a loaner car to make your life easier.<//text>

<text>Hands down the friendliest staff I have ever encountered in a dental office. Every single person I interacted with was kind and seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Not to mention they are very upfront with you about costs and won’t do anything without your consent. I am so glad I found this place!< /text>< pics>

<text>I am extremely frustrated with this dentist. I chose this dentist because they are contracted with my insurance. I was very clear from the beginning that I wanted to have my wisdom teeth checked out because I thought they needed to be extracted. It wasn't until the DDS (who was not Jeffrey A. Stratford-Jones DDS; I, in fact, never saw him during my three visits to the practice) came to examine me at the end of my first appointment that I found out that they don't actually extract teeth there! I would have chosen another dentist who could extract teeth. I felt like this behavior was extremely misleading and was purposeful so they could perform procedures and collect fees without actually addressing the root cause of my issues. Furthermore, during my third appointment, the DDS and assistant were talking about a patient they had referred for extraction and the DDS caused the tooth to break apart causing the patient extreme pain. Why would I see a dentist they recommend after that story?! My first appointment for cleaning was also miserable. The hygienist was extremely rude. She told me that I would have to get braces and, even after telling her multiple times that I would not get braces, she kept insisting that was the only treatment plan. She also kept telling me that I had gum loss and was making it seem like my teeth were falling out. Only later did she mention that my gums were actually within normal range. I had to request that she would not treat me during my second and third appointments. My second and third appointments were fine and I appreciate being checked in on after the procedures. My real frustration comes from their billing practices and the rudeness of the Office Manager Krista. The first EOB I received for cleaning said that I owed almost $200. After emailing Krista she told me that they write off those charges. I should have been informed that was the case before I received an EOB. Krista did let me know that each of the two subsequent procedures I needed would cost $156. I was not informed that some charges wouldn't be sent to my insurance so the EOB would say I only owed $46 when in reality I actually did owe $156 per procedure. I emailed Krista and she said that I would get a refund after my insurance paid. After I emailed again she said there would be no refund. She then became extremely rude and said that I signed the treatment plan so I should have known that they wouldn't even bother to bill my insurance for some charges. I would be less upset if she hadn't been so rude in recent emails and if she had actually explained all of the charges to me. I will never go back to this dentist.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

An overdue review. The hygienist I had was really thorough and nice... one star for her. But Laurie (I believe that was her name), the woman at the front desk, had signed me up for CareCredit without my informed consent. I needed treatment, and she said I could do a payment plan. She said she can check to see if I would be approved. I thought "check" meant, truly to check, with no long term commitment... and payment plan, as in, through their office. Laurie ended up signing me up for a credit card. I don't open many credit cards, so when I found this out after she clicked enter, I was furious. I said, "i don't want to open a credit card"... And she stared at me blankly like, "uh... I already did". So I had no choice but to sign the contract for CareCredit. I immediately cancelled the card when I got home, but doing so affected my credit score. Now whenever I check my FICO and look under "closed accounts" and "hard inquiries", I see CareCredit and think of the misinformation by Laurie. Thanks...</text>

<text>Our family has been with Dr Jones for over 20 years.  Going to the dentist is never a fun experience.  But with Dr. Stratford-Jones, we really get the best dental care possible.  The staff is knowledgeable, kind, friendly, and experienced.  And Dr. Jones  is really the as good as it gets.   He never pushes his opinion, but counsels and explains clearly so I get to make the best (guided) decision for my own mouth.  His work is gentle and precise.  I have even now convinced my Mom to come see him, because he is just that good.<//text></record>

<text>I had a crown done here about 3 years ago. Also, all the services done up to this point were great and I had no problems.

This samesame c had come off 2 times in 2 years that the Dr. needed to re-attach it. First time, no biggie and no issues with payment, as  It was no charge (as expected). Second time, I was told there would be no charge just like the first time... But they charged me and my insurance anyways for this visit. This was not good. I was livid and refused to pay and was sent to collections. It was not right to have to pay for a defect. The never made this right.

I just payed the $156 collection from that second visit about 2 weeks ago, so it would be removed from my credit report.

This same crown just came off today for a THIRD TIME.  Long story short, my crown was junk (crown was very short and had very little surface area to adhere to my tooth, also the porcelain was chipping off the metal below).

I've just paid $900 to have a new crown made. Dr took down the tooth and the gum to make sure this crown is done right.

I'm not mad anymore, really just disappointed this office never reached out to make this right. But.. I'm glad that my new dentist is fixing the root of the problem today.

Note: A new review will be coming for this new business I'm using now, when my new crown is on in 3 weeks.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>Awesome! Before I met Dr Stratford-Jones, I was TERRIFIED of dentists. The dentist is always aware of how much pain I am in and immediately will stop a procedure. His assistants are also most excellently trained. I have never felt forgiven a good review of a dentist office.

The hygiene technician, Connie if I spell it correctly, worked very carefully to clean up some stains on my teeth. At some points I guess she fully focused on cleaning the teeth and forgot to suck the water in my mouth, let some of the water run out to my neck :).</text></record>

Very nice and pleasant experience with the staff in this office. They were very thorough on explaining to me all that needed to happen in the near future verbally and on paper.
Very, very pleasant atmosphere.</review>

Love all of the staff that do the real hands on services, they are very genuine and compassionate people. Whatever is getting performed on you dentally is always efficient and easy to sit through. No complaints on my behalf as far as that is concerned. However, the lady with a southern accent who just sits at the computer all day is extremely rude and will really throw your day off with immense amounts of attitude. To be so disrespectful with considerably the easiest job in there is just beyond me. Not to mention, she is the first person who you speak with upon entry so she may very well taint your experience heavily upon arrival. It is almost as if she forgets that is clients are paying her bills, now due solely to this  broad's ignorance I will be moving to a new dentist after going here 15 years.< /review>

I've been a patient of Dr. Stratford Jones and his team for several years and I give them my highest recommendation.</text>< pics>

Do not work here. No one speaks English. If you do speak English, you are treated unfairly. Female supervisors are very rude. You have to ask to use the restroom and are denied to use it. This is America. This place needs to be investigated for unfair treatment. Do not work here!!!!!< /text>

Good place to go really good discounts.. every time I go in to the store I always try to give myself a budget of course that doesn't work.. I try not to take my kids... of course that doesn't work... I never walk out spending less than 150 but the items are all intact don't let the rip boxes discourage you I've looked up the prices online your still getting a better deal..< /text>

One Star because I drove from Glendale Ca to San Bernardino to find out that the Mattel  Store has been Closed for the past 2 years according to an office employee who was there. According to Google Maps and the Mattel Store phone number the Store is in operation. (which is not true)
The information on Google Maps needs to be changed.< /Text>

<review>When all the American Girl Dolls are being purchased by one employee. No wonder they say they never have any, only Willie Wishers. I thought there was something off about that. He was helping bag them like he was stealing them, all paranoid looking around even the cashiers. The cashier that rung us up said he workers here and bought all of them. Umm yeah because they werent on the floor. Sorry to see this place close but happy since all these corupt employees won't get to resale anything. I just wanted one for my daughter and was told no.< /review><Name>Dianna Garcia< /Name>< user>

<review>Love the Mattel store. Great bargains and if you don't mind a dented box here and there (I don't) then fantastic bargains on the green tag items. Cashiers are really sweet and super friendly. store is clean and neat. Perfect place to go for gifts for a child's Birthday (or me), Baby showers(or me) and of course Christmas (for me)!!!</review>< Pics>

This location is awesome! The customer service is great, fun toys, and has clean indoor restrooms. I was a regular for years at the Pomona location and it had portable restrooms for their customers!!!! Gross!!!! I never used them and when my kiddos had to go potty while shopping, we had to venture over to Jack in the Box across the street.<//review>

Not big selection of toys and prices are not crazy dropped. I highly recommend if you work for a company around the area to have a form fill out by your human resource department and add you company to Mattel's company list and you as an employee's for the company you work for would get 30% off regular priced items.</review>

Toy stores are fun. This is one of the few spots left as they've closed many locations. A bit above wholesale, if u go be prepared to bump elbows as many are there for a deal on toys< /text>

<Review>The cashier and the lady at the door were very helpful. But there was some lady that worked there walking in a group of people and every time they passed me she was staring. Never once did she asked me for help. Even when I got ready to purchase my merchandise she followed me to the register. Terrible experience.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

The warehouse is huge but the store is tiny and definetly NOT worth the hour and a half drive from Van nuys .The store was small and way over priced on most toys that were damaged or old . i went for the Hot wheels and i figured theyd have a huge selection to choose from but that was not the case hardly anything to choose from , So do yourself a favor and go to Walmart instead of Mattel store if you want to but toys< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcab528a624e9f:0x829ca272c83c5ce7<//Gmap_id></record>

<Date>1516745915889<//Date><review>I shop year round for Operation Christmas Child--A shoebox ministry through Samaritan's Purse for children in need.  Barbie, Ken, Hot Wheels, and Uno card games are some of the shoebox favorites.  When I arrived at the Mattel Toy Store, I was warmly greeted by Esperanza "Espie"--She helped me get started on my shopping spree.  She also told about the specials for the week and told me about the birthday club; I signed up my grandchildren...Can't wait to take them shopping during their birthday weeks!!  Out on the store floor, I was again warmly greeted by Susan who assisted me in finding other potential items that would fit in shoeboxes.  I made my way to the back of the store and found end cap shelves of green tag items discounted 50%!!  I found Barbie and Ken dolls and other miscellaneous items galore; the boxes were squashed but it certainly doesn't matter to me as I need to remove the packaging to properly fit them in the shoeboxes anyway.  Once I was ready to check out, Cynthia was very helpful and even watched the running total so I could stay within my budget.  She stamped my frequent buyer cards...WooHoo!!!  More savings!!!  The frequent buyer card earns you a star for every $10 dollars you spend, the card has ten stars; once you fill up the card, you get $10 dollars off your next purchase...Another way to save!!!  I would definitely recommend the Mattel Toy Store.  Thanks to the staff there, I really felt special shopping there!!!  I'll be back soon!!!<//review>< user_name>

< Review>
I/we go here every year to purchase Over 650 Toys for a Christmas Charity Event that I Co-coordinate , Deenice the Manager is Great, The Entire Staff at this Mattels are exceptional. Very Friendly and helpful with all your needs. Even though this Mattels is extremely far from us, we prefer it because of the great Management team and Staff of course the Excellent Selection of Toys. We have done business with Mattels for 21 years, going on 22 years this Christmas!
With Deenice the Manager 14-15 years. We started at the City of Industry,CA. warehouse and then moved to Pomona, CA. and now in San Bernardino, CA. I / we Highly Recommend this Mattel Toy Store Warehouse to everyone!<//Review>

Great coffee shop with fantastic space and art all around it. Its entrance is hard to find, and you must first enter the LinkedIn building and then take a right. Their coffee was pretty good and it is a comfortable place to come with both small and large groups.< /review>

There was a real homey vibe (no pun intended) when I first entered.

<text>Just like the other location on Market, the staff at the 2nd Street location are friendly. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you are unsure about what type of espresso to choose for your latte, the staff will guide you in the right direction. As usual, I got an Iced Breve Caramel Latte. The taste is consistent from one location to another. By the way, Breve drinks are made with Half & Half. If you like drinks that are creamier/have more milk, ask for Breve. The base of my drink is the Scratch Caramel Latte, but it would be too long to say Scratch every time. 😁 You can get it hot or iced.<//text>< pictures>

The staff is super friendly.  It is great you could purchase from the menu if it's early in the morning and it's still just"breakfast" time.  Craving a Fried Chicken Salad for Breakfast?  Yes, you can have it.<//review>

<Time>1566517533078< /Time><Review>This is one of my favorite public places to work from in SoMa. The cafe has a huge public space next to it which is adjacent to LinkedIn office. Huge ceilings and huge windows to look out plus great tables. No outlets there but I think that’s a good choice as closer to the cafe there are outlets for those who need. Thank you for such a great space.<//Review></record>

The art of Frank Stella is celebrated in this space. He was one of the first artists who believed you didn't have to have artwork alluding to underlying meanings, emotions, or narratives, and has remained of this same thought to this day!<//review>

Nice spot with the cool open-air vibe for a quick coffee or meetup with co-workers outside of your desk space. I prefer philz, but this is still cool in concept.<//Text>

I've been coming here for the past year and definitely my favorite coffee shop in the area. The space is beautiful and each day I'm greeted by smiles by the Equator crew. Alison makes the best macchiato in town!< /text>

It's like a coffee shop below Linked In's headquarters because that's exactly what it is. Descent coffee but usually a long wait. You can probably do better by walking to Blue Bottle nearby.< /Review>

<review>Located in the public space on the first floor of the LinkedIn building, this location offers craft coffee, tea, wine-in-a-can and beer, as well as light cafe fare in a large, bright open space. Lattes are smooth and creamy, but not too hot, so you can drink them immediately. Despite the large space, there are remarkably few places to sit as the few large tables tables are far apart. Additionally, the space is noisy, with no soft surfaces so sound really reflects through the room.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<response>None<//response><Name>Michael Braun< /Name><text>Huge space with a tiny bar, and with the height of the bar, felt totally disconnected from the baristas and feels impersonal. No sign for restrooms - it's tucked away behind the bar, totally hidden. (You need a code.) Also, my pour over was on the pricier side compared to other shops ($5.50). All that nit picking aside, it was a delicious cup of a Brazilian.

I love this place even before Equator was announced that they'll be a tenant. What's good about the place is wire basket seats with charging outlets. Security personnel station on Howard St, but they do a perimeter walk around too. Massive artwork and stadium seating options​. Being a consultant is hard work, but a relaxing atmosphere is much needed to close deals. Baristas always have a smile never a frowned face person. Pastries and coffee always the same occasionally they changed up pastries due to conflicting​ holiday in the week.< /review>

Equator makes great coffee, my favorite in the hood. But what really secures their awesomeness is the location. The public space inside the lobby of the LinkedIn building is... epic. High ceilings, massive windows, tons of light, laptop-friendly tables, giant indoor steps perfect for sitting and chatting with friends or colleagues. It's pretty much urban third-space nirvana. Too bad it closes at the end of the workday.<//text>

Great open-air spot on bottom floor of Linkedin building. They serve delicious tea, and fine coffee. The space is top in the financial district with solid wifi and beautiful open-air platform to let the creativity flow< /text>

<review>I was there during oracle open world and this place came highly recommended.  I ordered ice coffee for $4.5 and it seemed watered down.  Coffee was not worth the wait, hype.  It was so mediocre, i almost thought of asking my money back.<//review>< rate>

Loved the coffee, a bit overpriced but the seating outside was very dusty. Might try a different location.</review>

Located in an awesome POS. Has free Wi-Fi, lots of open seating, fresh air and lots of sunlight.  Only downside is it does get loud around lunchtime. Especially when a group of 20 toddlers take their lunch break there.</text>

<text>Situated in the back of the LinkedIn building POPO is a gem of Bay Area third wave coffee. Equator (from Mill Valley, CA) roasts a well balanced coffee bean and makes it into a wide assortment of brewed concoctions.
Their food offerings are minimal but of high quality. Staff is busy but nice and their manager is really friendly.
Upon receiving your drink, you have an assortment of places to sit, work, converse, and savor your beverage. With large open glass windows, huge installations of art, and oversized tables, the place is becoming the new community space in SOMA for out of office meetings, rain or shine.< /text>< Pics>

For me I would have to say that the food at Kallans, which on the day of my visit was prepared buy a local Lucerne Valley chef by the name of Ronnie, was extraordinary mouth watering and very delicious. The beer was cold the service was excellent and the prices were very very reasonable. All in all I give them two thumbs up, way up.< /Review>

Update: been back several times and always a good time. BUT today, 2/21/18, here at noon and it's closed. No notice on the doors, no answer if you call, nothing....</review>< Name>

Not the cheapest place in town, but the cost is worth it. Two burgers, three adult beverages, and an appetizer worked out to 55 bucks after tipping. (Well deserved by the quick waitress) the food was quite large, and we left with half a burger each and 2 mozzarella sticks left over. The drinks were well mixed if not a little lite. Great place to take a date.</text>

Went there for my Birthday and it was so good I came back again!
John is a great waiter, the food was great ... I can never get any one to make me a rare steak ... They nailed it..
My daughter had BLT great fries , portions and atmosphere.
We played pool after and there are may screens to watch the game.
Will be coming  back!</Text>

<text>Wish I could give NO stars. Went to this place for the first time on a Saturday night & it was dead. The bartender was kinda rude. She didn't know how to make drinks at all. My drinks kept coming out tasting like bleach or just cleaning supplies. I had one sent back and she said "I'll take your word for it" with a rude little smirk like eh whatever. My drinks kept tasting like not what I ordered. the pool table was filthy, just disgust. the cook was nice. didn't order any food. this was my first time going to this place and I will never go back. the other food places in Lucerne valley are way better and drinks are better else where. Bad bartender, maybe get another that knows how to make drinks and is nice!< /text><time>1505233095018< /time>< pics>

<Review>John and Kristy, were the first bartenders I've met since moving out here. Wish this bar was closer to Victorville, I'd be there much more often. The place is clean and modern - yet you'll find the locals, wearing hats and boots.</Review>< user_id>

Review for big bear location

For the food is give it 3 stars but as for everything else is give it 2.

Went to celebrate boyfriend getting a new job. Sat ourselves, waited a little while till someone noticed us, when the waitress noticed us she came up and said "are you ready to order?" We were not given menus yet and had never been before so, no we were not ready to order.

She brought us a menu and waters. Came back a few minutes later and we order the smapler as a starter. She goes to put the order in. As I read the menu more I realize that with the sampler it comes with chicken wings that are supposed to come with sauce on them. When she came back to take our food order I asked if the wings in the sampler come with a certain sauce on them cause she didn't ask us what sauce we'd like with them. While I was asking she rudely interrupted saying she already put that order in. She said she doesn't know because she hasn't taken many orders of that menu item. (I'm thinking, regardless of many people ordering it, know your menu) My boyfriend orders a  coors and Philly cheesesteak, I ordered carne tacos and shoestring fries. She begins to explain to me what shoestring fries are. She left and came back with our sampler and asked my boyfriend "what drink did you want? Did you say corona? I totally was spacing out" maybe you really were spacing out but you shouldn't say that. Say something like you wanted to double check. I quickly got my tacos but waited to eat them until my boyfriend also got his food. When he got his food she brought out another whole order of tacos and I pointed to my plate so she could see that I already got them.

I asked if I could get a few limes to go with my tacos she went to get them, comes back with a handful of limes. By a handful I literally mean she came back with cut up limes in her bare hands and starts placing them one by one on my plate. I leaned back and said "uh can I get in a cup or on a plate?" She responded "oh yeah... I just went back and grabbed them, I'll be back" like come on who does that?! It's health code violation to handle ready to eat items without gloves and this chick seriously just brought food right in her bare hands to my table. I was so shocked.

I never got my fries. She refilled my water but I was afraid to drink it. It was very hot in there and no music was playing. It's a bar, you'd think music would be playing. Not a great experience. Really don't plan to ever go back. I'd suggest making sure your staff knows the menu well before being a server and that they actually pay attention while taking their food handlers license test.</Review>

<review>I first used JW to get a second opinion when I thought a different plumber was screwing me. Turns out, the different plumber was screwing me. So now I’m back with JW to do a major repair, and I am delighted. My home sits on a concrete slab, so jackhammering was required to replace a pipe. It was important to me that they try to not touch my new chevron hardwood floors, and they went completely through a closet floor and wall, and left the floor is perfectly intact. The main plumber over seeing the job was Paul, and he’s great.</review><gmap_id>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1< /gmap_id><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

David the technician was very friendly and knowledgeable. I auto pay $180 yearly for JW maintenance fee so I didn’t have to pay additional for the maintenance. He did find the 40 microfarad capacitor was only reading at 34 so highly recommended replacing it. I felt the install was initially a bit pricey at $187 but was over a good call to replace it since the unit is only 8 years old and parts are still under warranty for two more years. David said if it wasn’t under warranty, just a new capacitor part could costs about $400.</Text>

<text>They were very quick to get someone out to assess our sewer pipe.  When Paul arrived, he was incredibly friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.    He and his team reviewed the situation and gave a great recommendation on how to proceed.   While it’s hard to actually go underground and see the work done, Paul did show me the camera videos (live) after the work was complete.   When the team finished filling the hole they’d created, we did have a small problem with the access pipe sticking out too far.  But Paul responded quickly and came the next day to resolve it.  Prices aren’t for the faint of heart, but it should pay off in the long run.  And Paul was great to work with.</text>< userid>

The service technician showed up at my house and within 15 minutes explain to me that I needed a brand new $11,000 unit craned up onto my roof. I told him I could not afford it and that I would just pay for the repair. They charged me $2400 for a repair and it did absolutely nothing. When I complain to the company they did nothing about it. At my own expense I paid to have another smaller air-conditioning company to come in and for $2200 they completely fixed my unit and it is working perfectly to this day. I will never bother going to a large company again as all they want to do is sell new units.< /Review>

I originally called JW Plumbing because of their excellent reviews and they did not disappoint.  Christian was totally professional and took the time to patiently explain everything in a detailed manner with what I could only imagine (behind his mask) was done with a smile.  I highly recommend JW Plumbing and Christian!< /Text>

Paul came out and was able to efficiently and expediently address the shower leak that I’ve had for a couple months now. He was able to walk me through what was causing the leak as well as to the remedy. Was very happy with the work (as well as the prices) and will be using JW Heating & Air in the future as well.< /Text>

JW Heat and Air called to see if I wanted to schedule an appointment to have my HVAC cleaned and inspected. I declined but asked if they also do plumbing as I had a couple issues. She said yes and scheduled an appointment. Paul came out and quickly diagnosed the problem with my toilet , replaced parts and also looked at my sink that sometimes backs up.  I declined the sink repair as it only happened periodically, until this morning when I woke to water pouring from my sink onto my bedroom floor. I cleaned it up and called JW. Paul came this afternoon and cleared my clogged sink in record time. I was so impressed with his promptness, friendly demeanor and knowledge. He wore a mask and shoe protectors. I highly recommend JW and if you get Paul you’re in luck! Thanks again Paul!.< /text>

They were extremely friendly and communicative. They completed the cleaning faster than their estimated time. Both of the technicians were deliberate about wearing a mask and wearing booties when coming into our house. They put a drop cloth down and cleaned up after themselves.

Our shower drain was clogged and was causing water to backup into our bathtub and toilet. We also had a separate issue with a leak under our kitchen sink. Paul got the shower drain unclogged quickly and we haven’t had any issues since. He diagnosed two issues with our kitchen sink, and we ended up installing a new basket strainer and faucet. We decided to purchase the faucet ourselves so he had to come back for a separate visit to install that. In the process of installing it, we had an issue with our countertop that had to be addressed first so we again had to delay him and have him come back for a third visit. All went well the last time and we are grateful that he took the time to address our needs and never charged more than the initial quote. Highly recommend working with him!</text>

<review>I hired JW to replace our 70 year old shower valve. It was a big job that had plenty of unexpected surprises due to the age of the valve. Paul was very careful with our existing tile work and fresh paint in the rooms. He is extremely professional, courteous and communicates so you know what’s going on and what your options are. They stand behind their work too. Highly recommended!< /review>< username>

Had no heat- called for appointment and Marco showed up within a couple of hours.
Marco went over a few issues that needed  taken care of in a timely manner. Suggested other fixes  for better heat/ air in unit that no other maintenance had suggested in 15 yrs . Will definitely call for projects ahead and use Marco.<//Review>

<text>Quote provided was just a total amount. No breakdown of the tankless water heater they were going to install -no brand, make, model etc

No mention of additional materials to be used in installation.

No labor breakdown. Just an amount of $3150.

When asked for a more detailed quote no response.

Initial contact person was excellent. Went downhill after that.< /text>< Pics>

When I called them, their operator said they had gone home for the day (4:30pm) and there was no way to get anyone out until the next day.  We have  a long history with JW since the dual zone HVAC they installed for us 3 years ago crashes periodically and shuts down the downstairs HVAC.  They’ve always been nice, but incomplete work (see above) and a delay in getting them to come back and fix their mistake has been a regular problem with them.  I think at this point we’re just done with them.< /text><Rate>3< /Rate>< Time>

Marco Bercian was awesome! Came on time, super professional, very patient- listened to all of our questions and concerns and gave great suggestions and tips for how to care for our specific unit. This is the 3rd company that I had to come out and look at the heater and the only one of the 3 who actually took the time to seek out any problems and the only one who was willing to listen and answer questions. So glad I found JW and we will definitely have them take care of our maintenance from here on out.<//Text>

<Review>I called because my well pressure tank had exploded with a huge leak. I called because they promote their company as providing plumbing services- and emergency services ! Well the gentlemen on the phone said they could not change out the tank and re-plumb a new one ? So,  bad back and all , I did it myself. I find it amazing that a company that says they do plumbing ,can't , or won't, and an amateur like me can ???? Will never, ever call this company again !</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1<//gmapID></record>

My heater thermostat blew out and MARCO came over from JW to fix it!  He explained exactly what was wrong with it and installed a new digital one which works great.  Additionally, there was a weird bypass that a previous owner did on the heater that Marco fixed and explained.  I was very happy with his service - very professional and knowledgeable!   He even explained additional heating/ac options for my home.  Thank you Marco!<//text>

<text>Gerardo and Christopher were our amazing service technicians. They would have received 10 stars but there were only 5.  They were polite, engaging, efficient, competent and knowledgeable and did an outstanding job!  They did not rush and took the time to explain what was going on with each of our units.  They observed COVID protocols while in our home which gave us great comfort.  Gerardo even remembered being at our home for our last service and recalled details about our units.  Needless to say, we were impressed.  We now have a maintenance plan with JW and my husband and I look forward to many years of utilizing their services.  I highly recommend JW Plumbing and heating without reservation. Angela & Mike</text></record>

Today I was rather fortunate to have have met Gerardo. Gerardo arrived promptly at our agreed  upon time, inspected, and then proceeded to review his assessment of the faults our system experiencing with me. As an electrical engineer myself, i appreciated his thorough assessment of the technical faults our system was experiencing, and subsequent recommendations for repairs. My experience with Gerardo today was nothing short of perfect. It must also be noted that along with his technical expertise, Gerardo had a tremendous attitude and a gift for communication.

<rating>5</rating><review>I am just a renter, but JW came out to service my air conditioner due to it breaking down.  Christian came out and was exceptionally kind and empathetic of the situation.  One of the most sincere guys I have ever met!  Must be because he's from Wyoming! Explained to me he was born and raised in a small town and learned HVAC at a mom and pop shop. Immediately made me feel like family! You do not find this type of service in Los Angeles and is something that most certainly cannot be taught. He got the unit up and running and was very thorough in what he was doing and was in contact with my landlord the entire time. He made the experience very seamless and gave me constant updates on where he was at in his process. I will most certainly be using JW and requesting Christian to come out when I buy my first home later this year. Thank you!!<//review>< Pictures>

Christian was our tech and he absolutely nailed the job....!

He came in to adjust some dampers for upstairs for even distribution of air last week and we had him come back to set up a bi- annual service (which we decided to pay a monthly basis for a discounted rate) of our entire home which is quite significant.  He took photographs showed me everything that needed to be done, detailed everything before I approved the work, the price was good I felt confident in his abilities and the work that he did.
He’s serviced three industrial size central air conditioning units and condensers, furnaces, changed out all air filters in addition to servicing six split units (wall units and ceiling units combined).

Thank you so much for your professionalism and work ethic Christian. You answered all of my questions and provided real-time solutions which made just made sense!  You clearly know your craft well.

Deeply appreciated,

Kent Guzmán</Text>

Benny was professional and thorough in understanding and analyzing the problem. He provided detailed explanations of each step he was going though and also eliminated all potential causes of the problem. I felt confident in his recommendations.
Getting an appointment was easy and prompt. Dispatch called to notify you when technician was on his way.
I definitely recommend JW Heating for HVAC and plumbing needs.</text>

< review>
It was 108 degrees F in Los Angeles on Saturday evening of Labor Day weekend and my AC stopped working.   I bought the HVAC system from JW when I moved here 9 years ago and JW serviced it as recently as last February.  I called twice on Saturday evening and was told a technician would call me.  I called again on Sunday at 11am - still no call back.  As the mercury was rising, I left a message for the owner, Jeff Williams and he called me right back.  He said they had 500 calls in the past day.  Within 15 minutes, his dispatcher called and in 30 minutes, Benny, the technician, arrived.  Benny was great - he replaced the power distribution and filter and cleaned the condenser.  He believes the extra stress of the dirty filter and condenser along with the extreme heat, caused the power distribution to fail.  The bill was seriously high, but since my health was in danger, it was worth the price.  I will always ask for Benny in the future - he was helpful and knowledgeable and worked really hard in the extreme heat to get the job done.< /review>

Peter is an outstanding technician and an asset to
J.W. Heating and Air. He is polite, and always informs
me as to the service he is performing on my AC/Heating unit. I ask many questions and he is so knowledgeable and he always politely answers my questions so that I can understand the technology of which I know very little. If I could rate Peter’s visit
today, he provided not just 5 star service, I would rate him as a 10. For any of my future J.W. Heating and Air appointments, I will ask that Peter be my technician.
He definitely is a “Keeper!”<//review>

Gerardo came to our home to provide our 1-year service check and he could not have been more professional!  He came prepared with gloves, face mask and booties to enter our home and then worked efficiently.  We needed our filter replaced and he was able to do so on the spot for us.  He talked us through everything he was doing and even made recommendations on how to use the fan circulation feature more effectively.  Our two dogs were in love with him the minute he arrived, so I have no reservation of asking for him to come perform our service checks in the future!  Many thanks!< /review>

Angel and his partner were great. They were on-time, professional, informative and showed me the progress of the work throughout the day. They ensured that their work was reviewed by me and answered questions along the way. I would certainly use their services again.< /Review>

Very professional from the plumber to the office.  Very thorough and explained clearly on all services.  Paul was friendly and did an amazing job with all of the last minute fixes that needed to be done.  Denise in the office was friendly, and I appreciated the phone calls with updates and keeping my account accurate.  Would definitely recommend for all plumbing needs.</Review>

<text>Thank you JW Heating & air and to the technician Christian Eisenbarth! This guy saved thebday!!

Our  Air conditioner crashed and Christian was able to start it backup and running! We had 3 other vendors come out and not one of them even tried to resuscitate our unit - On one of the hottest weekends this year!

I've never met such a kind and considerate individual that takes pride in his profession.

What a great representative for JW Heating and Air

Thank you Christian!

This company was amazing! I originally called them in an emergency, and even though it was a holiday weekend they scheduled a same day evaluation and didn’t charge any emergency fees. They take 24/7 seriously!

I am an HOA rep and we had really bad issues with pipes in our garage and with pipes attached to multiple individual AC units. Because JW has HVAC specialists and plumbers, they were able to solve our issue on one day and with all their team members. Other companies had told me I would need multiple people to pick up the project at different phases, and this was so much easier.

The employees were respectful, knowledgeable, efficient, and kind. I enjoyed every step of working with them, from my first phone call to my final walk through of the finished repairs. I highly recommend them!</Text>

<Text>Had JW out to do my annual service. Christian was prompt and took all precautions necessary with to make me feel safe with Covid. He was extremely positive about life and wanted to be the highlight of my day! was such a refreshing energy to be around with everything going on! We turned on the furnace together to make sure it was working since this is the first time this year. Unit did not come on properly and he immediately identified the issue and guided me through his diagnosis process. He evaluated the whole unit and gave me options. We chose the bandaid option since finances are tight this year. Was very polite and clean! Very trustworthy and showed me all old parts and replacement parts with lots of pictures.

Wooowww!!!!
Words can’t even describe how amazed I was with today’s service. I read a couple of the latest reviews of one star and they make no sense to me. The entire process had so much communication, professionalism and kindness. Christian came out and diagnosed our furnace we have been having troubles with since it’s been installed, and the problem got bad enough to where it needed to finally be addressed. After quickly diagnosing the issue he gave me some options to pick from and explained to me why they are recommended. So many things about this call amazed me.  He was incredibly personable, and was not in a rush to get to work and genuinely cared about my well being. After the issue was diagnosed he submitted the information needed to the office to find the part. While we were waiting we talked about existential things like the universe, consciousness, meditation and other things with such depth and substance. It wasn’t small talk like the weather or politics. I truly feel like I became I better person after my conversations with Christian.  He is so wise for his age and light years ahead of me and I’m almost 60! I’ve been going through one of the hardest times in my life and this conversation gave me hope and excited for my future.  I talked his ear off and he genuinely listened and blew my mind with his optimism and perspectives. It actually took about 45 minutes or to find the part. Once they found it, he told me it was an hour away and that he will go drive and pick it up even though I told him we could reschedule since it will take a couple hours to get, he was determined to complete the job and give us heat before the weekend. He left, came back about 30 mins later and told us it turns out he’s not going to be able to pick up the part in time due to the warehouse closing. He said he was sorry we couldn’t couldn’t grab it, but he had good news.  HE CALLED AN UBER!!!!! Seriously had an Uber pick up the part and deliver it so he could get our furnace working. If that’s not 5 star service, I don’t know what is.
While we waited for the Uber we talked some more. JW has such an amazing young man representing this company and I will be forever grateful for the life lessons I was taught, I feel alive!
Request Christian!!!<//text>

We could not have wished for a better service than was provided by Christian. He was thorough and took time to explain what he found wrong with our old units and what are options were to fix them.
The company was also very professional with their interactions, contacting us to confirm our appointment and then keeping us informed as to when we could expect the technician to arrive.
On every level this company provided the best experience.<//review>

My technician, Gerardo, was prompt and professional.  He was very respectful of my home and considerate of my in-house teleworker - that was much appreciated.  His review of the system was comprehensive, and he did a great job of walking me through and explaining what was needed.  I appreciated his transparency and thorough report.  I signed up for the monitoring agreement with no hesitation... I'm happy to do business with JW Plumbing, Heating and Air... thanks to Gerardo.<//review>

<review>Marco came today for our regular servicing. He easily and readily accomplished everything we asked for: adjusting the dampers,  explaining how the unit fans work, explaining and pricing our choices for installing attic fans.  He found an error in the piping for the master bathroom exhaust pipes that was causing a bad smell, which we also priced for correction.  We have always (for decades) been pleased with JW and especially pleased to have Marco doing our work.  He is highly accomplished and informative!< /review>< pics>

After much searching and researching, we selected JW for a new air condition system and they were great. Every technician that we have dealt with was knowledgeable, professional and very thorough. Our recent maintenance was conducted by Gerardo and he is really wonderful.  We had a sort of tricky situation with a move and he worked to find us options and advised us in a very professional and non-sales’ish way. Our new house doesn’t have A/C and we will use Gerardo to install...no better recommendation than repeat business!</review>

Gerardo is the best!!  I highly recommend him from JW to do all of your servicing for your air-conditioning or heating units.  He was very knowledgeable, thorough, professional, and timely.  I don’t review often but I had to give Gerardo and JW heating & air a five star for sure.  If I would give them ten stars I could!!< /review>

We called JW Cooling because our Nest thermostat was not getting power from the circuit. The technician Christian arrived on time and went to the attic to check on the AC unit.

After 15 minutes he says the circuit board needs to be replaced and it will cost $1200! Now I know the AC unit is working fine as the same company serviced it about a year ago and it was functioning perfectly up until 2 weeks ago when the thermostat wasn’t powering on.

I suspected it was just a wiring issue to the Nest thermostat and I indicated that in my service request.

After we said that we would get other companies to check and get a quote the technician said he would lower the price to $900 which was very suspicious.  When we didn’t agree to the repair, he went up the attic again and then says he thinks there’s nothing wrong with the circuit board and it was a wiring issue and it would cost $350 for the repair.

At this point, even if we still thought we were getting ripped off (to think we are repeat customers!), we wanted the problem fixed right away and agreed to pay the $350. The AC was up and running in 5 minutes - probably he just taped a loose wire that supplied power to the thermostat. He was in and out of the house in 45 minutes.

We will NEVER call this company again for any AC or heater issues. Neither should you.</Review>

I did find out that during our visit we first identified the control board as the failed component as we measured it's readings against manufacturer specifications and found that it was not operating as designed, as an existing customer the technician offered a discount for repair to make sure we could get you up and running that same day. From there, our technician continued his diagnostic and found that there was a wiring issue. Once that was identified as the main issue, we came back with the great news that the circuit board was fine and the wire repair was all you needed. I find it good news when we can save customers money but in your case sounds like maybe the technician did not communicate this very well at all and we will be having a discussion with him about this. Our core values that we strive for everyday are Honesty, Integrity and Accountability and I will not allow anything to deviate from these values so that customers can find trust in us. I would love to discuss this issue with you personally so please call me directly Jeffrey as your trust and experience is very important to me. Thank you, Jeff Williams JW Plumbing Heating & Air"}< /Resp>< GmapID>

Beyond pleased with the communication, care and honesty. I can’t believe there’s actually amazing people out there who care! Our tech was kind and attentive and amazing. I wish I could hire him away from this company! They’re lucky to have him, and I’m lucky to have used such a great ac biz! Now, here’s hoping this fix lasts five more years!</Review>

<Text>I can’t say enough good things about my experiences with JW. They installed our new AC unit three years ago and everything was done perfectly. Today, I had them come back out for an annual service call. Marco arrived on time, complied with all COVID safety measures and was incredible. He was knowledgeable and efficient.  He provided options on how to keep my system running smoothly, explained all costs, and was just an all around great person to interact with.

I highly recommend JW.</Text><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1592593595113<//time><user_id>111901087107053078510< /user_id><username>Linda Smith<//username><rating>5</rating><Gmap_id>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1</Gmap_id>< pictures>

Recently had maintenance and part replacement done on my air conditioner. Marco came over right on schedule. He did his inspection, took lots of pictures of his concerns and we discussed options, costs, etc. Marco was very professional, experienced, knowledgeable and customer-friendly. I’ll certainly ask for Marco for my next maintenance visit!< /review>

JW Air installed my HVAC system 5 years ago and at that time I was very impressed with their professionalism and service. I’ve continued to use them for my semiannual  HVAC inspection and have never been disappointed in their work or customer service. They are easily the most professional and customer service-oriented of any business I’ve worked with. I sense they spend a great deal of time in training and developing a strong company value of customer service.  They’re just the best.<//Review>

I called JW Plumbing and Heating and got a very polite person who asked me questions about our issue.  Our issue was that our heater stopped working.  They scheduled their technician to come out and take a look.  Marco came in and took a look and changed out the thermostat and also changed the fuse at the heating unit.  He went above and beyond to show me some other potential issues and his recommendations for solutions for the long run.  He did a great job and was a really nice guy.  I really appreciated the good work.  I would definitely use the company again.< /Review>

JW and Marco are great. He came out to my house when my ac was broken. He explained everything to me in detail and performed exactly what he told me at a fair price.  I definitely will call and ask for Marco again. Very professional. Thanks JW.</text>

I had a terrible experience with a competitor. This firm fixed the problems in the most cost effective manner possible. They them replaced an entire AC system starting with a proper survey, educations is on options and implications, and pricing the installation fairly. They delivered as promised. I highly recommend them for maintenance or new systems. Professional, smart, good value for money, nice people too. RG.< /review>

< Review>
Friendly. The technician, Victor, came out to assess the situation. I am a DYI type but had no availability to fix our blown motor that day. The price to solve the blower was about 5 times higher than the part only price if I ordered it from Amazon and did it myself. So I have to justify it by the convenience and headache free experience. Victor was finished in 2 hours and treated us with high professionalism.</Review>

Antonio and his partner (forgetting his name!) were great!  They came to do an air balance for our newly installed system and were extremely thorough and patient while I had them adjusting each vent little by little to make it just right in every room.  They were super polite, wearing booties to come in the house so as not to dirty our floors even though I told them it wasn't necessary.  Antonio also made sure that I understood everything they checked for our maintenance exam and went over every item individually and with great detail.  I will be requesting to have Antonio as our service provider in the future!</Text>

JW Heating and Air has always been outstanding!  It has been the best home improvement investment we have ever made.
Bryan G. who came out to our house today has been an eye opener to what exceptional customer service can be. He should be a role model for others to follow. Thank you Bryan for your courteous and empathetic demeanor.
All the best to you!!!!< /text>

Antonio came out today, right on time. He was very thorough and explained what he was doing as he address various areas of the system.

He was very personable, respectful, and knowledgeable. JW installed the system 3 years ago and I have been happy with their service ever since. Antonio was the i I g on the cake. Highly recommended.<//review>

HIGHLY recommend!!
JW Heating and Air is a first rate, professional, 5-star company! Quality and customer service are alive and well! It is so refreshing to see a business embrace these fundamentals. My experience from the first phone call to the service call itself was nothing but pleasant and professional. Communication was great. My service technician, Peter, was outstanding!  He was punctual, kind and considerate, and very knowledgable, and extremely thorough. He carefully took his time in diagnosing the problem with my heating unit and explained every step of the process to me to keep me in the loop. He was not going anywhere until he got to the bottom of the issue. I appreciate this kind of transparency. It puts the customer at ease when everything is clearly laid out and all options are presented. Bottom line is: Peter and this company clearly take pride in their work and hold their customers in the highest regard. I'm not one to usually write reviews of my dealings with service industries, but my experience today compelled me to share my satisfaction. Great work! Will definitely recommend to others!< /Text>

They charged me $99 for coming to check my air condition. They said the only thing I can do is change the filter for $20, which is not included with the $99.

They told me my AC unit is 19 years old when it was changed 10 years ago. They gave me a quote for $10,000 to change my unit.

I got another guy to come and they changed the filter and said my unit was fine and working properly.

So basically I paid $99 for nothing. They would not even change the filter!

I do not trust these people</review>

For the $99, we diligently went through your system for 1 1/2 hours and showed you pictures of very tired and extremely rusted and worn out parts of your system. The system we believe is very much past 10 years and it was our service technicians opinion was that it was a better value to replace the system rather than install a lot of parts and then end up replacing the system shortly after. I can assure you that our service tech gave his very honest evaluation and am sorry that the results were not communicated to your satisfaction to see the value of the visit.

I had Christian out from JW to service my AC a couple weeks ago.  I was hesitant to bring any one into my home due to Covid-19. The office assured me that they are taking the necessary precautions to keep us, and their staff safe during this time.  Christian came on time and wore  gloves, shoe covers, and a mask.  He even disinfected every thing he touched before he left with an organic cleaning solution.  He was very kind and genuine, and asked genuine questions and expressed a lot of empathy with how we are doing during this time. Stated he is very grateful to still be working and very blessed.  He also said its been very hard on him to see so many families struggle during this time since he's interacting with new people every day who are no longer working or had lost their job or business.  Also informed me that they have been keeping busy with air purification solutions that can help remove viruses and other things from the home, he left me information on it and wasn't pushy at all about selling me it, it felt it was necessary to at least let me know during these times. I am unable to make that investment at this time, but I referred JW and christian to a couple friends who are interested in having them out to install.  Thank you very much!</Text>

You want a guy who knows how to represent your company?  Christian is the guy.  First time in forever that someone took the time to explain a technical situation in clearly broken-up sections, then walk me through the options, then make reasonable, not money-grubbing, suggestions.  Great guy. Give him a raise and count yourself lucky!</review>

Thank you for the great service! Scheduling our appointment was a breeze and the service was delivered in a timely manner.  Mr. Victor was wonderful and incredibly professional. I appreciated the commitment to utilizing PPE. I am most thankful for Mr. Victor’s patience and willingness to answer my  6 year old son’s curious questions.  Our air conditioner is up and running, and my son learned about the engineering of a machine. Thank you!<//Review>

Bryan (Technican) was truly wonderful. Super respectful, knowledgeable and efficient. Diagnosed and fixed the issue very fast. For the repair and service the cost was fair but be careful of their add ons and up sells. Bryan was by no means pushy but the company model seems to be to add on certain items that feel a bit unnecessary. I ended up passing on the add on items and just went with the bandaid repair due to the high cost of the extra options. All in all, I would use them again and very happy I went with them. Ask for Bryan If he’s available. I wish all service calls went as smoothly as this one.<//text>

A/C died over the weekend. Called first thing Monday morning and was on the list for an appointment same day. No specific time slot, but was updated with ETA throughout the day. Marcos arrived and diagnosed the issue (components) quickly. He and his tablet walked me through the cost/replacements in a way that was easy to understand. Sidenote, glad it is all on tablet and not triplicate. He offered additional services for future proofing that didn't make me feel coerced/dire if I didn't go for extras. Components in Van and a/c is running within two hours. Covid aware and polite in requests. Will use again.<//text>

Marco is a well trained, experienced air conditioning and heating equipment technician for one of the best companies for in Los Angeles with whom we have a long history of excellent service. Marco has an excellent work ethic, he diagnosed the problem with our condenser, explained what had to be done, how much it would cost and assured us that he had extensive experience repairing the problem.
We expected that it would take several days for him to receive the parts needed for the repair but he went out of his way to pick up the parts and did the repair the next day. Extraordinary service!!!! Drs. LBV</review>

We are pleased to have JW Heating and Air as our new A/C and Furnace maintenance people. I researched the company and was impressed with the response I received from the Manager, Dave! He arranged for a special
tech to service our home. Sal was early for the appointment and met with
the standards I would expect from a company with JW 's reputation.
Thank you, Dave!< /review>

Tony was very knowledgeable. Explained everything to me. Showed me where the problems were. He said to me if I had any questions ask him he would be happy to answer them. He was wearing all protective gear for covid 19. He seemed to be very proud to work for JW heating and air. Tony is a professional and a great asset to the company.</review>

As Christian was troubleshooting my system, he took the time to explain everything to me.  He seemed very thorough and knowledgeable.  Also, there wasn’t any pushy sales pitch - he just presented the facts and explained the options I might want to consider.  Every person that I had contact with was really pleasant.  They might be on the pricey side but you get what you pay for.<//Text>

<review>This review may sound cheesy, but I’m honestly writing it because of how great our experience was. Gerado Tecorral was beyond amazing. Im always a little nervous and skeptical when a new person comes in to repair something in our home. Right away he was so kind, respectful of our space and explained every step. He was also super nice to our barking dogs and took the time to sit and let them get used to him. He kept us updated through the whole process, there was a good amount to fix and he showed us before and after pictures of everything. I would hire him to fix every part of our house. This guy deserves a promotion! Seriously. Super thankful we got him and chose to go with this company :) You can tell they care about their customers.<//review>< pics>

Couldn't have been happier. Our tech Sal arrived on time and his professionalism was outstanding. He explained the process he would need to go through in order to fix our a/c unit and gave me an estimate for the various options available to me. The cost was not cheap but you get what you pay for. I feel I received excellent service for the price I paid so I'm completely satisfied. Would definitely call JW again for repairs and request Sal.< /Review>

< review>
I called JW Heating & Air after receiving a special for a $49 furnace and A/C inspection. I was worried that for such a low price, I might not get exceptional service. I was wrong. It was definitely a 5 star experience. They called to ask about any time scheduling concerns, then called again when the technician was on his way. The technician (Christian) arrived right on time, was friendly, courteous, and very professional. He did not rush and thoroughly checked out both units. When finding an issue with the A/C unit, he recommended a repair, but did not push and did not give a "today only" price. He also offered answers to some allergy (and clean air) concerns, but again... did not initiate any high pressure sales tactics. I will definitely call this company back after researching and making some decisions... and will also request Christian as the technician.<//review>

Marco was a true professional. He was super friendly and explained what he was doing clearly in layman’s terms. He also provided a range of pricing options from JW to fix some minor issues with one of my units. The best!<//review>

Michael came out from JW Heating to inspect our current heating system and give us options for adding air conditioning to our home.  He was extremely thorough, calculating every option to give us the most efficient and cost effective system which is what we're looking for.  He took as much time as we needed to answer ALL our questions, which were numerous.

Thanks again Michael!< /text>

< Review>
We had a complete HVAC installed last June; 3T Unit, all new duct work, relocation of two and addition of one more ceiling vents and a complimentary Nest thermostat ... three days ago our heat wasn't working consistent with how we set the temp on the thermostat and then this morning it wasn't heating at all.  I called early in the morning and they were able to put me on the schedule for today. (BTW - I've never had a company keep in touch on the status of their arrival more, or better, than JW does!)

Christian came out to diagnose the problem - and wouldn't you know .... the heat came on!!!!???!!! I talked him through all the *symptoms* of what had been going on, he asked questions and then went to looking for any irregularities with the system. He did his best, but -since the heat was now working- he was hard pressed to find a culprit. He did take off and clean a sensor, which he says sometime can be an issue, though he didn't feel strongly that it was in this case, but it didn't hurt to do at least that just in case (an appreciated show of good faith on his part, for sure). Anyway, so in the absence of any findings to the issue, which was now a non-issue, Christian left. He, however assured me should it fail again do not hesitate to call them back out - they want to make it right! He also let me know something I did not know - in the event that the system fails again, not to shut it off completely, to simply adjust the settings to allow the system to go into stand-by so they can read any error codes from the unit.

In all my years of being a homeowner I can say when you find a service company that follows through, stands behind their equipment and labor and commits to making it right then you stay with that company. JW Heating and Air is that company for me! This is my second unit install and services with JW, we had a new system put in our son's condo as well, and every time; be it scheduling with the office personnel, meeting and working with a sales person, or meeting with a technician, they have always made me feel like a valued customer.

Thank you Christian, and thank you JW Heating & Air ... again!< /Review>

We were looking to replace our 30 year-old unit and got estimates from various installers in our area.  In the end, we went with the Costco Heating and Air program.  In our area, JW Heating and Air were the vendor that did the work under the Costco program.  The installers were awesome.  Thank you Jesse and his team (Miguel and Anthony).  Very professional installers and patient with all my questions.

There are many companies who are qualified to install AC and heating but JW stands out because of the installers and quality of work.  When we did the HERS testing, the inspector also commented on the quality of the installation.  It was nice that the owner called to follow up on the installation and to see if there were any issues.< /text>

<Text>Michael was straight forward and honest about pricing and our options with no pressure to sign on the spot at the initial consultation. We didn’t end up moving forward with AC/heating due to a change in finances. We have not received any phone calls, text messages or emails since our consultation, which is surprising but appreciated. We will definitely use JW Heating and Air when we are ready because it seems like a solid and trustworthy company.<//Text><Name>Julia Lugo< /Name>< date>

I had my heating service done today 11/11. The person who did my service did very well. His name is Marcos. He inspected our wall heater and did went to attic. The attic was good, where our wall heater connects. Notice in our wall heater some  parts will need some replacements.He explained and showed to us the parts had some defected and will not last. My husband and I agree to replace the defective parts. We want a peace of mind. We didn’t want to chance  anything to happen...
Marcos did a great job on our heater. Marcos was honest and we trusted his judgements. He is very respectful too..
Thank you Marcos..

He was very friendly, polite, and someone we were very comfortable having in the house! My mom is 92 years old and he took time out of his busy schedule to visit with her! That meant the world to her! We will always request Bryan when we call for maintenance or service! Thank you Bryan for taking such good care of us!</text>

My wife and I recently had our heater serviced by Antonio who works for JW Heating & Air. Antonio was punctual, polite, efficient and very clear when he explain what he was doing. A lot of time home service companies are not very strong in the customer service department, leaving you feeling uneasy about the service and price. My experience with JW Heating has been the exception. They are clear with what they will be doing, when they will be arriving and what the cost is. I highly recommend JW Heating & Air (and if you're lucky enough to get Antonio) to anyone with home heating and/or air service needs.<//review>

Back in April I was in the middle of purchasing our home.  Marco came out and inspected our system and found issues with our hvac system.  He took pictures and showed us what needed to be done.  I would definitely recommend jw and Marco with friends and family</review>

<Text>Got a call in the morning to check what times worked for me.  She said she would give me a call when the technician was on his way.  She did, and   Bryan arrived at the specified time and got to work right away.   He took care to not track the copious mud from my front steps into the house, which is no easy task.  He was incredibly pleasant and personable, and made sure I understood what he was doing and what his findings were.  Unfortunately the heater was beyond help, but he checked each of my room units and cleaned the filters, as well as checking the outside fan and making sure everything was in good shape.  He showed me pictures of any issues, and made sure I understood my options and any possible future charges.<//Text>< pics>

I'm a good friend of Christian and while back at home visiting for the holidays, he took time to check my furnace which stopped working and coming from someone who didn't know a single thing about JW or furnaces at all, it was awesome to get some background and learn how things work. He explained things in a way I could understand, and offered fantastic suggestions for future maintenance. He also fixed my fire place. He takes pride in his work and it shows, and spoke so highly of JW and how happy he is working there.  I'm really happy with his success in Los Angeles and that he found a company that makes him feel like home.  Couldn't have happened to a better guy.  Please request Christian for any of your needs, because he truly finds art in his work and will provide a genuine human experience. He is the kindest most honest man I know, and you should meet him</review>

The service man that came out to give our unit the winter tuneup was so friendly and personable. He valued our home like it was his own making sure that there was a dropcloth anywhere he went and he wore shoe covers. It’s so nice to work with a company that is so clean and friendly. Five stars!!!<//review>

I felt  my lack of ac knowledge allowed for some shady  dealings. I had a tech named victor.  Whom now after getting a second opinion, did not have  the know how to properly  diagnose  my ac problem. He stated i need my outside ac unit replace because there was a leak. He tried to show me where it was but could not see where the dye had leaked out. Made me skeptical.
When i received the invoice the picture he stated was the leak was in a differt spot than what he had tried to show me. When i questioned some of his doing he told me if i didnt trust him to get a second opinion.  This could of cost me 1500 just for the unit not including installing. After a second opinion i come to find out it is my unit inside my house not allowing for proper air flow, basically the coils inside my inside unit are clogged with dust. Replacing the outside unit would have done nothing and i would have been in the hole alot of money.

Because i cannot  respond to whom ever wrote me... i want to clarify,  that i did not have 2 companies come and recharge or add refridgerant.  The original company who installed my unit 11 years  ago came out 2 time to adjust the refrigerant.  Your pictures are inaccurate to what a leake looks like with dye/sealant  put in. I would never trust your company in my residence again. Luckily i have found  a very honest  technician who has completely fix my problem which  WASN'T a leak!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

After speaking with Victor, you had two other companies it the past that added refrigerant due to leaks and Victor found a refrigerant leak as well. We added dye and have pictures of where the refrigerant oil has leaked out. If your not repairing it now please give us a call when it leaks out again and we would be more than happy to repair the leak or offer you other options as well.

Gerardo was very friendly, informative, and thorough.  He took plenty of pictures and walked my wife and I through what he found. He set up an appointment an for an estimate of suggested work to be done.  I have been with JW Heating and A/C for a number of years and they have never steered me wrong.<//Review>

Michael Campbell, the JW Customer Rep was knowledgeable, professional, and a nice guy.  He was very thorough in explaining what work would be required, the equipment that would provided (with options and recommendations), and provided two quotes- one if the new A/C unit could be installed near the existing unit and the second if the new A/C unit had to be moved to the back of the house depending upon where our property line was.
Although JW was not the cheapest quote that I got, Michael explained that JW employees were highly trained and long time, bonded employees; all equipment provided were of high quality- e.g., Lennox A/C and Heater; and that City inspectors would certify their work.  (Michael said JW Heating & Air will only do a job the right way.)  The price was a little less painful after Michael indicated that Costco would provide a 10% gift card, and we would also be eligible to receive a couple more discounts/rebates.
Michael left me his business card, company brochure, information of the Lennox equipment that would be installed, and a copy of the work order.
The next day, Steven, the manager of the installation teams came by to inspect our premise to make sure the installers would have everything they would need to complete the job in two days.  Steven was very professional, personable, and reassuring.
First thing Monday morning 7 A.M., Steven introduced me to Ramon, the team leader of the installation crew, and a couple of the people who would be installing the HVAC system.  Ramon and his crew were great.  They were extremely, extremely polite and humble, efficient, quiet, and neat and hard working.  They covered the floor with tarp, cleaned-up at the end of the day, and were tidy during the day.  After the crew was done for the day at 3:30 P.M. , my wife  pointed out a number of problem that she found, e.g., a crack in the ceiling, a gap around the a/c pipe outside, and a couple of light switches that were not working now.
The next morning, Ramon and his crew were at the house at 7 A.M. again ready to work.  I talked to Ramon about the problems that my wife had discovered the previous day.  Ramon was polite, listened patiently, and said in a very reassuring tone that they would take care of them (which they did).  Again, his crew was very polite, efficient, and neat.  By 3:30 the crew had finished their work and left.  Again, they cleaned up everything, inside and outside the house. The work looked beautiful.  Very clean and professional.  (The entire process from start, first call, to "finish", installation, took only one week.)
Ramon stayed behind to make sure the HVAC system was working properly and explain how to operate the new system.  The a/c worked perfectly.  The heater, unfortunately, would not come on.  Ramon worked on the heater for one and a half hours, but could not fix the problem despite calling the office.  JW called me later that day and said they would send someone in the morning to look at the heater.
The next morning, Steven (the manager of the installation crew) came by to inspect the heater. Steven said he thinks the problem is a defective part and explained the function of the part.   Steven said this was the second a/c unit in 20 units they had installed that had this problem. Because this was a new unit, he was hopeful that they would get the replacement part and be able to fix the problem by next week and of course there would be no charge.
Although the job is not "finished," I am confident that JW will fix the problem.  (I'm just glad that it's the heater that is not working and not the a/c!.)  The primary reason, my wife and I went with JW Heating & Air is because they are a Costco vendor.  Based upon my dealing with JW,  I am glad that we did.

David was great. He showed up and walked me through everything that was going on. Unfortunately there was some bad news, whoever had installed the system before we owned the house did it completely incorrectly and we basically had to start over. He showed me photos, drew out a diagram, and answered every question I had. Tough pill to swallow having to get a new system installed but David’s knowledge and clarity made going with them an easy choice. Highly recommended.</text>

<Text>When reading   online reviews for JW heating and Air the first thing that will stand out is how they are predominantly very positive and it becomes even more evident when the reviews are compared to similar  businesses.  From the first time you speak to someone on the telephone until the service is completed  you experience excellent customer service. I recently purchased a new heating and air conditioning system to replace an older system. . Everything happened exactly on the timeline as described.  From the initial estimate appointment to the follow up phone calls about the sales call service, the on-site visit to prepare for the insulation and finally for the actual installation.  On the installation day the installation team arrived on time, set up inside and outside in a way to least disturb me and my neighbors. The installation supervisor explained what was happening during the course of the day. The entire installation team was friendly, professional, and courteous.After the job  was completed, the team cleaned everything and left no trace they had been there. A checklist was completed by the installation supervisor and reviewed with me to ensure my complete satisfaction. It was stressed to me that if I had any questions or concerns to let them know immediately  as it was the goal of JW Heating & Air to provide services which exceeded their   customers expectations. This is a company I would highly recommend. Your time and money will be well spent.< /Text>< Pics>

JW Heating and Air is really wonderful... but, what makes it absolutely FANTASTIC are service people like Marco.  He was by far the best I have had yet.  He was honest, kind, and went above and beyond to tell me what needed to be done, what didn't need to be done, and what to expect.  I always worry about the "sales pitch" for each maintenance visit but I felt Marco really tried to focus on the necessities to keep my system running versus parts and service that were not mandatory.  I really hope Marco stays a part of the team as I want him back for each visit.  Thank you!< /Text>

He listened to my concerns asked lots of questions and after. Inspecting my equipment he walked me through his findings.  He then explained a game plan to remedy the problems. Juan gained my confidence and demonstrated respect of my home.  I signed a yearly service program and look forward to working with JW Heating and Air for years to come.  I</Text>

So, I had J W Heating & Air back last week to clean the duct work on our master level.  Angel, while servicing the HVAC unit the week prior, recommended that we clean the duct work due to its being covered in drywall dust & dog hair.  I had been putting it off because it sounded like a huge, expensive undertaking.  Turned out that was not the case.  James & Travis of J W Heating & Air showed up early by 15 minutes, set up shop and proceeded to tackle the task.  Seeing the ducts before & after the cleaning was freaking unbelievable.  Not only were the ducts sparkling clean, the air smelled better.  James explained that they use Simple Green to polish the ducts and that's what I was smelling.  I thought he mentioned placing scent sticks inside the ducts, but I may be mistaken on that point.  When finished cleaning the ducts, James & Travis cleaned up and left the area cleaner than when they came.  From start to completion, James & Travis were here for ~ 2 ¾ - 3 hours.  Once again, J W Heating & Air excelled in the services they provide.</review>

The technician arrived on time for the service call. He explained the procedures well. He did a great job installing, testing, and cleaning the equipment! I was just a little confused on the pricing. I thought I heard two different service fees, one from the operator during the service call, and a different price from the technician. But it all worked out.<//Text>

I received several estimates for a mini-split HVAC system and went with JW. JW installed a complete system in my condo remodel. They did a spectacular job. From the initial estimate, pulling the permit and dealing with Santa Monica planning through passing inspection, the people at JW were consummate professionals. Their employees are punctual, courteous, clean (wore booties without being asked), and highly skilled.

Their work is high-end commercial quality. It is the Rolls Royce of HVAC companies. I could not be happier with the entire experience. And now seeing just how amazing a mini-split system is, I will never go back to a giant noisy furnace with dusty ducts... I highly recommend JW to anyone in need of HVAC services. They do not rest until you are completely satisfied.<//review>

This company was very professional in their manner and thorough in checking out my furnace, making sure the vents were clear and doing a full diagnostic so I could trust their recommendation for replacement. They were also very supportive of my need to be conservative in spending and even gave me pointers on what to look for in other estimates so I could make the best decision for my needs.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1<//Gmap_id>< UserId.>

Dale came to the house for maintenance on our unit and he was polite, professional and courteous. We have a no shoe policy in our home and before I had a chance to ask he was already putting shoe covers on!! He thoroughly examined our unit made some suggestions on how to keep the system running optimally. Overall great experience!< /Text>

Gerardo was very responsive to all my questions and did a excellent job repairing our heater.  He worked around my schedule and stayed late making sure the system was fixed and in great working order. He helped me understand how my heating system works and how to program the thermostat. I would definitely recommend him to friends in the future.< /Review>

JW originally installed our a/c and heater in 2016. JW was not the least expensive, but worth the additional cost. Our sales person was Dustin and he was great throughout the process. Our most recent tech Marco, was very thorough, detail oriented and gave me some solutions to issues that I've had for a few years with the a/c unit. Will continue to use them for my maintenance, hopefully for years to come!< /review>

<user_name>James Tsai</user_name><UserId.>113004448581591943490<//UserId.><Review>The A/C unit stopped working, and I had to find a company that serviced the Arcadia area. As usual, I posted a request on Angie's List to get some quotes and JW Heating, and Air was the first to respond. Gerardo was very prompt and arrived earlier than I had expected. He was very courteous and got started immediately to diagnose the problem. The best part was that he explained what he was doing each step and was very thorough, documenting with photos at each stage. After the diagnosis, I was given three options as to how to move forward. The compressor and HVAC being almost 20 years old, it was comforting to understand what my options were. In the short term, I needed the unit to function throughout the summer. In the long run, install a brand new system. I would say they are not cheap, but this is one area I would spend a little more money on as safety is always a consideration and you want the job done right the first time as all things considered these systems should easily last 10 to 15 years.<//Review>< pictures>

First couldn't have a permit from the city because we had a gas leak. They came and fixed the leak. Then after the first rain we had water coming out of the vents on top of our TV because the platform for the unit was badly done.  They came and fixed it.
Now after 4 years,  not mentioning that we'r still paying for $13,000 unit, we have a freon gas leak due to a defective part. The part is under warranty but we have to play$900 for labor.
I am giving 5 stars because despite of those problems,  this company took care of us. Gerardo, was a great tech, he explained everything very well to me. I trust him.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Gerardo seemed very thorough and determined to do all that was needed to service and clean the AC system.  He even went beyond his job to help me with a difficult ceiling light.  He was very personable and kind.</Text>

Juan Sierra came to my home and did an extremely thorough inspection of my furnace.  He patiently showed me photos of the inside and out of the equipment and shared with me all of the issues he spotted.  He gave me the short term option but was clearly concerned with safety issues so also shared with me a longterm option.  It is certainly the first time in a long time that I have received such a comprehensive assessment of this heater and it is clearly critical that I received it.  He was excellent!</Text>

There was an initial problem with making my appointment. Within 24 hours, the owner of the company called me to explain the circumstances, take responsibility, apologize, and offer me a discount. I understand that problems happen, sometimes beyond our control, and how this company dealt with it shows that they live their values. He dispatched the next available technician who arrived within 90 minutes.

Gerardo, our technician, was wonderful. He was professional and even put on booties and a floor covering to make sure our floor stayed clean.  He was extremely thorough and explained everything. Although he did not have the part we needed, he found a solution so we had our heat restored and will be back to finalize our repair once the part is ordered.

We are fans of JW because they know how to treat customers.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1< /Gmap_id>< Name>

While I was dubious about this process - I felt like I ask a different HVAC specialist and get a different answer - I am REALLY enjoying working with Gerardo.

Technician David clearly explained what was happening and laid out several options to move forward and maintain my HVAC system. We hardly use the heater here in SoCal, but we live on that AC.</review>

I’m just a tendant, but it was nice knowing how thorough Christian was and how knowledgeable he was about the systems in this home. Very friendly! Usually dealing with people inside your home is awkward, but he felt like a family member and played with my dog for about 10 minutes after the work was completed!< /Review>

I was referred to JW Heating & Air through the LADWP AC Optimization Program. My appointment was scheduled for 9a today. They called at 8:30a to let me know Christian would be about 15 minutes late. He arrived at 9:10a.
Christian was excellent. He conducted a thorough diagnostic test of all my equipment and performed a tune-up all while explaining and showing me what he was doing and finding. I definitely will use their services going forward (requesting Christian) and will recommend them to anyone needing HVAC service.<//review>

After the hot summers over the past four years, we finally decided to get an AC system installed.  We interviewed 3 contractors and JW Heating and Air stood out above the rest with their knowledge, recommendations, friendliness, and competitive  pricing.  We are so delighted with the service they provided.  We decided to update our 15 year old furnace at the same time.  The controllers they recommended have such user-friendly screens (we were thinking about Nest but Ted recommended another as being easier to use. Comparing notes with a neighbor who has Nest, they said it can be a bit cumbersome.  We are very happy with the choice).  Our AC system cools like a dream!  All of the JW Heating and Air workers who came to the house were clean, friendly, and super nice people.  I was so impressed when they brought their own hand soap and paper towels to use in our bathrooms- so considerate.  They always put on shoe covers whenever they entered the house.  Their work is excellent and clean up was fantastic.  While the whole process took about a week (new heating and air systems), everyone involved was a pleasure to work with.  They facilitated city inspectors and helped us get the final sign off inspection.  So happy we finally "bit the bullet" and got our updated heating and new AC!<//review>

< Review>
The technician from J.W. Heating was polite, helpful and thorough. When failing components were found in the compressor unit, he had photos of the damage or incorrect readings to show me on his tablet. Good policy.

On the other hand, the installation of the replacement components was astonishingly expensive, especially given the function of the parts involved and their retail cost. Installation took less time than diagnosis. Regrettably, all this is common practice, not unique to the HVAC business.<//Review>

<Review>I was experiencing problems with my air conditioning unit during this heat wage, and it was terrible. I called JW Heating and Air, and the technician Marco Bercian came to my house. He was polite and very professional. He assessed the problem, and upon giving me an estimate and I approved it, he worked on the unit and got the problem solved. I called again a few days later because I had some problems, but it turned out that I just wasn't setting it up the right way. The air conditioning unit is now working, and Marco did an excellent job. Thank you Marco, and thank you JW.</Review><response>{'time': 1565307129156, 'text': "Wow, Olga!

< review>
I had a great experience with JW heating and air conditioning when I replaced both units in my 1952 year old home. Their employees go above and beyond by making sure the process goes smoothly and efficiently. They do not try to sell you something you don’t need. Initially I had asked to have the technology to cool and heat separate sections of the house so as to run heating or cooling for only the rooms we used most often. But as it turned out I didn’t need the extra expense this would have cost me because my home is under 1500 square feet and one story. It is cooled and heated comfortably without that extra feature.

They also helped me with the permit process which can be problematic. I am grateful and happy I found the right company that demonstrated both honesty and integrity to their clients.

Thank you JW Heating and Air,

<text>I received an estimate for new install HVAC the Tech was very knowledgeable an through with details of the process. I also felt more more inclined to choose this company because of their backing by Cosrco.  I found out later that Costco being involved created a MUCH Higher bid for my project, so if we. can discuss a reduction i've made my choice</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The consultation was done in a very professional and respectful way. I appreciated how he wore shoe booties up the stairs ( I have lightly colored carpets) he also came within the timeframe promised. The people who I spoke to on the phone we're also very nice.</Review>

<date>1569618217342< /date><review>JW Heating & Air gets another A+ for consistency!  We needed the filters changed and checked on my elderly aunt's home, so we called JW who had installed her new HVAC system last November.  Since she lives near the airport, we were/are especially concerned about "airplane dust".  The tech who showed up today, Christian, was awesome!  Right on time as scheduled, and very knowledgeable about the systems, how they work, and provided us with several options to further improve the air quality in the home, which we took him up on.  And, he did all this without being sales-zy at all.  An extra plus, Christian was super kind and chill with my aunt;  some people just ignore the elderly as if they aren't even there, not this guy.  Highly recommended.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had a really terrific experience with David from JW Heating and Air.
I have been using them for 20 years now, but this time I needed a lot of
work done.  He explained everything to me in great detail which i really appreciated.  He took photos of the problems and showed them to me.  I needed a new battery as well as a tray to catch potential water run off.  I am also going to get dampers for all of my vents that he said were not well insulated.  He always shows up exactly on time, and i like that he takes so much time to explain it everything to me.  David is a gem, and I am sure JW values him enormously!  When I bought my home 20 years ago, Jeff (the owner) came out to service my house.  I never forgot how kind, patient, and honest he was.  I've used them ever since.< /review>< pictures>

I called JW Heating and Air to have our A/C inspected, tuned up, charged up, etc. because it felt as though the cool air was not as cool as it once was.
I was surprised to get an appointment within 3 days even though we are in the middle of a punishing heatwave.
Angel was the technician who showed up
- early by 5 minutes - and devoted six hours to caring for our 3 A/C units.  Angel was very knowledgeable & kept me in the loop as he progressed through the house.  He had every part he needed on his truck so there was no time lost chasing down parts - a pet peeve of mine.  In the end, it was not cheap but you get what you pay for and I am more than pleased that I've got functioning, efficient A/C units again.
I will definitely use JW Heating and Air in the future - and I will ask for Angel to be the technician.<//review>

Great service. The technician took the time to thoroughly inspect my system, diagnose the problem, and present me the various options for fixing things. He made sure to keep everything clean in and around the work area and tested the system to make sure it worked perfectly afterwards. He was friendly and professional.

I am pleased so far with JW Heating and Air.
I hoped I would chose right when looking for  a company to do my HVAC installation.
I also wanted them to be responsible and
supportive BEFORE and AFTER the work is finished.
Ted came and spoke with me about what was needed and carefully explained the process and estimate.
I feel good that he makes himself available for any thoughts and questions.
I will update my review after the work is finished.

My experience with JW Heating and Air could not have been better. A+.
Ted, our sales person was super patient and great at walking us through everything and Ismael, the lead technician was really cool and talented and ran a great crew.They left our house spotless after 3 days of really challenging work.
Probably most importantly though is that our house is a PERFECT temperature in spite of a summer heat wave.
I would highly recommend JW to anyone.<//Text>

Christian arrived promptly, checked air conditioner and heater. Very up front about their condition. Set me up with appointment for estimate on replacement. Personable but didn’t waste time. Greatly appreciate his frankness.
Gerardo extended his day to check my AC. He followed the protocols of the company. Quickly determined the problem was not within my home. Did a check of the unit on the roof. Found the problem and was able to replace the part. Checked for temperature after replacing.
Explained the issue clearly. Helps that all was under warranty. .

Paul looked at my old water heater and confirmed that it should be replaced. He provided me with an estimate explaining the work to be done. I scheduled a date for the replacement. He arrived with Frank on time. The work was efficiently done. Couldn’t ask for a better experience. (Thanks!)</Text>

We had a great experience with JW and their whole team. Originally we brought them in for a second opinion and due to a couple visits and creative thinking they got everything we wanted done for ~$4k (30%) less than a competitive bid. I was also really impressed with how professional and friendly the whole team was. Thank you!</Review>

JW Heating and Air did a fantastic job! We had a new AC unit installed. The access to the AC area was a bit challenging. JW’s crew showed up promptly and went to work right away. They spent close to 10 hours here to make sure everything was done properly. We are very happy with their expertise and the professionalism of their crew. We highly recommend JW Heating and Air.</Review>

Our heater died recently, and being a 1975 unit is is pretty worn. Jacob was very helpful in figuring out what to do and WHEN to do it; after a thorough system check he gave me some options and worked with my situation. It was a great intro to a company that will surely get my business in the near future when I pull the trigger on an upgrade. Thanks for the great service!</review>

< Review>
Installing a complete new AC/Heating system with new ducts involved practically every room in the house. Yet we were able to conduct our daily lives without interruption. The JW crew Shawn, Rudy & Christian were absolutely superb in many ways: Attention to details - punctual -  at the end of each day's work everything was clean - everyone was polite & friendly - they supplied bathroom with their own towel etc. - cooperated well regarding any concerns I had - knowledgeable -it was team-work at its best - contracted crane operator impressive! And last but not least I would like to thank Ted, who patiently assessed the work to be done and stayed in communication until the work was done.</Review>

< review>
Had to replace the old ducts in my house.  Ted from JW came out to give me a quote for the work.  Not only did i receive a quote from him, he also told me that the company i purchased my system from may have installed the wrong equipment in my house.  And sure enough after a few phone calls i found out that they indeed installed the wrong unit in my house.  I received many quotes from different companies and had all types of technicians out to look at my system and no one caught this issue.  He didn't have to go that extra mile with me to help me fix my problem, but i am so glad and thankful he did. Fast forward to almost a year later finally cause that's how long it took to get the correct unit installed, JW did my duct work. The crew was very professional,  and was very knowledgeable. Explained everything that was happening during the instal, and once it was completed if something didn't feel right, they went right back up and made adjustments . So i am very pleased with the outcome. They will be doing all my maintenance on my system from now on.....thanks JW for a job well done.< /review>

JW Heating & Air serviceman, David, came to replace a motor and fan in my 5-ton unit. Upon inspection of the new motor, he decided it was not going to operate well and needed to be replaced. Considering the high heat today and ahead, he called JW for the search of a new motor nearby and found it. He picked it up and installed the new unit today allowing us cooler days ahead. I really appreciate how professional and concerning David and JW are in providing the best most complete work. They are on time, friendly, caring and professional. I  highly recommend you to use them.<//text>

< Review>
I have been a customer of JW Heating and Air for several years. I have never had a bad technician sent to my home to do maintenance service on my A/C system. The latest technician Eric was very polite  and very thorough performing the inspection and maintenance of the system. He explained everything and like all of his peers he took the trouble to wear booties over his shoes while in the house. Great job everyone.< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>I enjoyed working with the team at JW Heating & Air. Their technician performed a checkup on our HVAC unit. He was kind and took the time to explain everything that he did on the unit. As part of the process he tuned the blower's RPM to increase the airflow and took out some refrigerant because the HVAC was overcharged. Thanks to his work our unit will be running more efficiently than it was before. The service was covered through the LADWP HVAC maintenance program, which enables LADWP customers to receive an HVAC tune-up every two years. After the excellent customer service provided by JW Heating & Air we will rely on their team for HVAC maintenance moving forward.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Couldn’t be happier with JW Heating and Air. They installed my HVAC two years ago and regularly service it. They did such a great installation, any work men who have needed to go into the attic say how good a job they did.  Michael, the technician who came for the maintenance checkup today was professional and a pleasure to have around. Even my dog licked him.< /review>

I had Mike come for the semi-annual checkup of my HVAC system. He didn't disappoint! Everyone I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with at JW Heating and Air has been pleasant and efficient. Aside from being punctual and courteous, Mike was especially wonderful in that he took the time to explain to me how the system works. Three cheers for JW Heating and Air.< /review>

<Review>I recently had my heating unit checked for its regular maintenance by JW Heating and Air and wanted to make a comment on how happy I was with the service I received.  I was extremely impressed with Tony who was the technician for JW Heating & Air.

Tony's knowledge and his ability to make sure I understood what he was trying to accomplish on this service visit and I, especially, appreciated his explanation and breakdown on what was needed to help keep my heating unit in top working condition.

I feel Tony is a great asset to JW Heating and Air and I appreciate all of his efforts and thoughtfulness in making sure I was a satisfied customer.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1575569149097, 'text': "Wow Lorraine, thank you so much for leaving this incredible review!

Angel, the technician, was excellent.  He was on time for the appointment to service the HVAC system.  Fortunately, he detected a leak in one of the AC drain lines and noticed the lack of a safety switch.  He repaired the line and installed the switch during the appointment.  Angel alerted us to a problem with the AC condenser that presages a potential failure in the future.  He set up an appointment for me to meet with a salesperson next week.</Text>

JW Heating more than lived up to its excellent reputation that it already has from the Next Door website.  Our service tech, Dale, was absolutely outstanding!  He is smart, knowledgeable, courteous, caring, and friendly.  It is SO good to know that a quality company like JW Heating is out there and that they employ wonderful people like Dale.

P.S.  Please remind Dale it’s VirZOOM and oculus quest.  He’ll know what it means.<//Text>

Mario with JW Heating was very knowledgeable and professional.  I have done my own research so I was able to determine he knew what he was talking about.  But, unfortunately as a consumer I am always looking for the perfect deal.  We could not come to terms on pricing, so I am unable speak to the quality of the service that the company would provide.<//Review>

We just completed a large project with JW Heating and Air.  We needed a new furnace, ducting, insulation, and in addition, we added an air conditioner and filter. I can't speak highly enough about this company.  From the thorough follow-up and knowledgable guidance provided by Ruddy throughout the decision making process, to the crew (Ramon, Raul and Felipe) who did all the demo and installation -
this team went above and beyond expectations.  They were efficient, considerate, meticulous, and extremely knowledgeable. I highly recommend this team.  They were truly a pleasure to work with.<//review>

JW is great and I really appreciate how helpful and down-to-earth the staff is.  They were very quick to send a tech out to our place today and to troubleshoot our heater. Alex was awesome and had it sorted out very quickly. Glad I used them for the original install of our new HVAC and will always call them first for maintenance or user error :-). Highly recommended!<//Review>

These guys are great. I will try and keep it short and sweet; If you have any issues with your AC system, do not hesitate: Call JW to get the job done. Our team showed up prompt, they were very professional and they explained the process all the way through. I am very satisfied with the service that they provided, and I highly recommend them.< /Text>

< review>
JW Heating & Air is one of the best companies I have done business with in a long time. After moving to LA a couple years ago, I had given up trying to find companies with solid customer service; it seemed every service company I had come out to my house for repairs or service either didn't show up, did a shoddy job, or had just awful customer service. But JW Heating & Air was very different. They were the third company we had come out to look at our HVAC system in our new home to give us solutions for inconsistent air flow between a couple of our bedrooms. The other 2 companies basically couldn't help us, and later we realized they gave us very incorrect information anyway, once we did some research. JW Heating spent the time to explain exactly what was happening with the way the HVAC system was set up in our home, and detailed various options of what to do about resolving the issues we were having.  They implemented the solution we opted for, and all along the way they have been terrific to deal with. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for good solid quality work and great customer service.<//review>

On May 1, 2018, we had the Spring tune-up of our air-conditioning (A/C) system.  Given that we had had a problem with a previous service last Fall, we asked JW Heating & Air to send us a senior member of their team.  Juan Sierra arrived punctually, explained in a friendly manner and in considerable detail what we could expect from our system in terms of service and repair, and then performed more than 3 hours of thorough service on our two A/C systems (one for each floor).  He ended by asking us whether there was anything further he could do for us before he removed the various protective tarps he had spread over our floors.  Juan was courteous, unhurried, and helpful in every imaginable way and easily won 5 stars for his visit and service.  We have owned two homes, one on each coast, and have used quite a few companies to service our heaters and A/C systems.  JW Heating & Air, which was recommended to us by a neighbor three years ago, is by far the best of these companies, both in terms of service and repairs.  We recommend them highly and without any reservation.</Text>

< review>
5 stars for not doing anything!   How about that!   That means these are honest folks.  They couldn't find the problem with the furnace since it was intermittent.  But we had video of it not working.  But since he couldn't find the problem he said there was nothing to fix and he wouldn't charge us!  Any other place would have just "made up" a problem and replaced some part that didnt need replacing and charged a ton of money.  Not these folks.  That honesty and integrity go a long way and I am now going to be a loyal customer.  Sure it cost them some money to send the guy out,   but they will make it back when I have other problems they can fix or when the furnace craps out completely.  Thanks JW!</review>

I very seldom post a review and use the word "Awesome". Felix Garcia was my the technician who arrived on time to my surprise and delight. Felix cleaned my heating system, replaced my filter, answered all my questions patiently and gave me excellant recommendations. I totally would refer JW Heating & Air and if your blessed, Felix will be your technician.</Text>

I have had excellent experiences with JW Heating and Air and recently Cesar C. from the company replaced some damaged ducts from underneath my home. He arrive on time, worked efficiently and when finished, he cleaned up so you wouldn't know anyone was working in the basement.  He spread drop clothes to protect the floor and he corrected a couple of other problems not described in the estimate.  Great attitude, easy to talk to and overall a great guy and conscientious worker.  JW is lucky to have people like this on their staff.  He is always welcome to come back!< /Text>

I love these professionals.  Basically, our condo project is still in the middle of JW installing 9 AC units, and what is so apparent is how professional they are, pleasant, hard working, and plain competent at what they are doing.

<Text>I chose JW after interviewing six heating and air conditioning providers. It was, by far, the best in terms of level of expertise and was informative and helpful. The installation of the HAC unit was impressive, even requiring a huge crane to lift the compressor to the location on the north side of our house. Matt Linden, who came to inspect the unit this past Tuesday, 3 April 2018, was polite, professional and efficient.<//Text>< date>

We had a new HVAC unit installed 12/16 had have been very pleased since.  JW has been very responsive to questions/concerns, and even helped get the energy rebate.  Today we had our first complementary maintenance visit for the heating prior to cold season.  Fernando C. was very friendly, professional, and efficient.  JW honored the first year complementary service, including a replacement filter, which costs $189.  Again, we have been so impressed with the service and support by JW, and would highly recommend to others.<//text>

<Text>A week ago I called for service to check out what I thought might be a problem with my recently installed heating system. The service representative could find nothing wrong and left. A few days later, when I went to the basement where the equipment was housed, I noticed that the face of the heater had not been put back. Since it was a simple matter to do, I put it back myself. I also noticed water leaking from the heater so I called JW and told them the problem. They promptly sent out Victor D later the same day. He noticed immediately that the plug from the water pump had been pulled out of the wall socket and that was why water was leaking from the heater instead of going into the pump. He also took the time to explain various functions of the heater installation. Although I was disappointed in the prior service call and its result (i.e. leaving the pump plug disconnected and not replacing the heater face), my confidence in JW was more than restored by Victor's attitude, knowledge and general demeanor. Victor represents the best kind of service representative and JW should be glad he is in its employ.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>We are very happy we had JW Heating and Air-conditioning replace our HVAC.  Starting with David who knew what and how to check the old non functioning unit .   We made the decision to replace the unit without any pressure from anyone.  The work was done quickly and efficiently with all the necessary equipment to remove the old unit and replace it with a new unit.  The servicemen Jose, Christian, and Miguel were on time, courteous and efficient with the necessary knowledge to do a superb job.<//Text>< Pics>

Scammy. Called to simply ask what they charge per pound to replenish freon. This is not a trade secret. Not colonel sanders' recipe. And yet they refused to give me that info whereas all other ac shops were happy to: instead they offered to have a tech come for $99 to tell me how much they charge per post me of freon. That, ladies and gentleman, is a scam.<//review>

Mark B. of JW came out today for a routine service call and to hunt for a slow leak that has eluded us for quite a while.  Extremely good experience.  Mark found the leak and performed all the work quietly and neatly.  Very personable without sacrificing any efficiency.  I can't say enough good things about the crew at JW.  Solid performers who honor their commitments.<//Review>

I'm in the process of doing a total gut and renovation of my condo.  The team from JW Heating and Air installed new duct work and an air conditioning unit on the roof (new air handler and fan will be after the drywall is installed).

My experience started by meeting with Ted who worked with us to define the system that would best fit our needs.  He also helped us to come up with a duct solution that allowed us to relocate some ducts in order to raise a ceiling in the hallway and master bedroom area.  Ted was very courteous and always prompt in answering questions or meeting at the unit as we refined the design.  I couldn't ask for a better consultant!.

Shawn, Ramon, and Ignacio were our installers.  Phase 1 was scheduled for 2 days and they completed it on time.  All three team members were extremely personable and clearly knew what they were doing.  They arrived early both days in order to start promptly.  With a total gut of the unit, dust is bad.  However they wore "booties" when leaving the unit to prevent dust from getting on the hallway carpets.  I was doing other work in the unit while they were working and there was never an issue with me being there.  The installation far exceeds my expectations, and all debris was promptly cleaned up and removed from the unit throughout the work day and at the end of the day.

It was an absolute pleasure working with the JW Heating and Air team.< /Text>

<Text>The crew of Shawn, Ignacio and Ramon was prompt, hard-working and efficient.  In addition to installing a new furnace, they replaced all the ducts in the attic and crawl space.  They were very pleasant and made the process as unobtrusive as possible.  Everything works great.  Ted analyzed my needs at our first meeting and we signed the contract that morning.  He also returned after the job was done to inspect the work and solve any issues I might have.  Very happy.</Text>< pictures>

Had a service appointment yesterday for the split system I got from  JW about a year ago.  Alex G. was fantastic.  Thorough, friendly, helpful and very professional.  He took the time to do the job right, got the system working smoothly again, and cleaned everything up afterwards.  I would ask for him again in a heartbeat.</review>

My 27 year old a/c unit died and needed replacing.  I had a few people out to give me an estimate.  David from JW Heating spent the time to explain what would be the best options for my home.  A two-day job with a short 3 hour follow up and the system works as advertised.  Ismael and the installation crew did a fine job and kept disruptions to a minimum.  The attic is no longer cluttered, it is now tidy and efficient.</review>

I  find it hard to believe that so many people have given this company five stars. Our experience is horrific. We called first thing on Monday morning to set up an appointment and we were told that we would have to wait until Friday for the repair man to come.  We were not happy about that but we understood that they were extremely busy and we were willing to wait until Friday.  However, they did not show up and we called numerous times on Friday to re-confirm and make sure they were still coming and they never came. We have an elderly person staying with us during a heatwave and now we have to continue to live without air-conditioning.  We received a phone call at 6 PM on Friday stating that they were not going to make it and that we would have to wait until the following week and take off another day of work to wait for the repair man</text>

Dustin called ahead, arrived on time, got right to the diagnosis and repair, kept me informed of what he was doing, explained what the problems were, showed me the worn out parts, priced the repair fairly, then when I agreed, replaced the parts with brand spanking new ones, and cleaned the entire unit. I asked about a maintenance contract, which he offered, and I accepted. Had not had one in a few years because I couldn't find a reliable contractor. Well, now I have!  I got to know him in the process, and learned quite a bit about the air conditioning equipment as well. Dustin not only repaired the unit and restored cool air on one of the hottest days of the year, he gained my trust and confidence, and a happy customer for JW Heating and Air.< /review>

I was looking for a heating and air company and came across this company because they had more reviews then any other company and more 4 stars then 3.  Well now I know why they have so many 4 stars. I am so glad I finally found a reputable company who is very professional and informative.  The tech was very professional and listened to my concerns intently.  Instead of charging me a price of what he thought the problem was, he converse with his supervisor and called me back to confirm the price and problem.  He was right and I haven't been cold or hot since.  Everything has been working like my heater and air should be.<//text>

JW Heating was able to do the work two days ahead of original schedule. The crew arrived early in the morning and worked all day to replace all components of a heat pump mounted on the roof of our condo building. Not an easy job, given the cramped space housing air filters and associated gear. We are happy to recommend the crew and the company.< /review>

The tech was very professional. The heater had stopped working on my HVAC unit. Turns out to be dirty filter. The tech did not try and sell me additional services. It is a 10 year old unit. The tech pointed out things I should keep an eye on.< /review>

Mario, the field advisor, was professional, courteous, gave his honest opinion, and explained things well (cost, best options for AC). I'd asked 3 other companies to assess our home for AC and none of them said they could do the job (our furnace and duct work is not amenable to regular central AC installation). And they said there were no options that would be entirely satisfactory.  At least JW Heating and Air gave us a viable option. They were recommended by our friend, who had them install AC in jos 1950's home. So they definitely can do the job! The cost, however, is prohibitive for us at this time.< /text>

Having a new HVAC system (including replacing all ducts and relocating some vents) installed by JW Heating and Air was actually a great experience. This is the first time that, from the initial meeting to the project finish,  everything I was promised happened. They finished on the specified day, no extra costs, the crew were very respectful of my house as evidenced by how clean they kept everything and there wasn’t anything left undone to be put on the list to finish/redo later.
It’s like working with a family that is very passionate about what they do and and is very proud of how they do it. It’s a little scary at first, then you realize they are real and BAM it’s over.
If only they would get into landscaping and flooring.<//Text>

<Review>JW Heating sent Ruddy B to service our AC unit which has a history of working intermittently and Ruddy was able to determine we were in need of a new motor.

After finding he didn't have the right motor on his vehicle, Ruddy retrieved the right motor that same day and we have been enjoying  a cool house ever since.

We will be contacting JW Heating and Air for any of out Heating or AC needs in the future.<//Review>< pics>

Marco did a great job with resolving the issues we were having with our Lennox iComfort WiFi thermostat.. He also did a comprehensive checkup on our current air conditioning system and made appropriate suggestions for what needed to be fixed, also providing photos of our unit so that we could see what was wrong that needed replacing. Very reasonable pricing as well. Thanks, Marco!</review>

Excellent service! Very professional -- every appointment was on time. Communications were excellent; schedule changes were notified well in advance. The crew that did the installation did a great job. They worked well together. Left the place clean and neat.

The job was the full replacement of a 40yo HVAC system in a two story town home. Replacement was with a new heat pump and air handler.< /Review>

OMG I just needed to take a minute to thank JW Heating and AC for installing Central Air Conditioning in my home. We've had over 9 days of 90 degree temperatures this summer and my house couldn't be more comfortable. Josh and his guys were efficient, courteous and cleaned up after themselves everyday. Plus it feels good to support a local business and an Iraq war veteran. If you're reading this and thinking about installing AC just pick up the phone and call JW Heating and AC. You'll be glad you did.< /review>

The service was very thorough.

We had a mini split system installed last year, and it wasn't turning on.

Our technician Josh traced the problem down to wires that were shorting, causing the breaker to trip. It took him awhile to whittle down all the possibilities, and I'm glad he was very thorough at fixing it. Would highly recommend them. We changed to JW from our previous guys, and have not had a problem since.<//Review>

The professionalism and responsiveness to our small business needs have exceeded my expectations!  In this hot weather, when the AC goes down, it's critical to small businesses such as mine that these problems get fixed quickly.  I very much appreciate the sense of urgency from JW and all their staff.</Review>

Joshua came out a week ago and diagnosed the problem. The fix would involve adding an extra drain pipe which due to the installation (in an apartment) would take a couple of hours to install. We decided to reschedule the work for today, and Joshua came prepared with everything needed. He put plastic up on the walls and protection on the carpet in the area where he needed to work. It was a pleasure to see how careful and precise he worked, and when he was done he cleaned everything up so the area was as clean as when he started. JW office staff was very helpful in realizing there was a problem, and in their interest in making sure that it was taken care of. I'm so happy Joshua came out, and I give him my highest recommendation. He is really someone that goes the extra mile. Thank you!< /review><Name>Palle Christensen< /Name><Rating>5<//Rating>< resp>

David was also a giant help in troubleshooting the problem wires causing the problem. They were curteous and professional. They replaced my thermostat based on their knowledge of CA codes and double checked that my A/C was still working too after correcting the problem with my heating system.

Leo of JW Heating came out to inspect the heating system (12/22/18) and diagnose the issues/problems. Leo arrived early for the appointment, and he was professional, courteous and friendly. He thoroughly explained how the heating system operates and addressed our issues/problems.</text>

<text>I live in a small town in Cambridgeshire, England. I've just moved into a new house. Sadly the climate here isn't like that in California and so I've no need for air conditioning unit but if I did need one and I lived over there then I'd definitely  consider these guys. I just wish my American namesake would stop giving out my email address to companies who spam you constantly asking for feedback. :-) Peace xxxx<//text>< pictures>

We had a very positive experience with JW Heating & Air.  Everyone we dealt with, either by phone or at our house was incredibly polite and efficient.  While they are slightly more expensive than others, the quality of their work and service is excellent.<//text>

After several attempts to diagnosis the problem with my dad's A/C unit, Joshua W. was knowledgeable and professional in relaying to us what the problem was and why we kept experiencing lack of cooling with our unit several times within a short period of time intervals.   He informed us honestly what would need to be done to rectify the problem.  He was pleasant, did not rush and truly wanted to do a thorough job. He sealed the coil that had a leak in it and informed us that it may or may not hold.   Since the problem was occurring way before our warranty had expired,  JW honored replacement of the coil that was causing the problem.  They pursued us in setting up an appt to do the work to replace the coil.  No sooner than the coil was replaced, we experienced dripping water from a crack in the ceiling.  Josh came out again and diagnosed that there was an opening in the drain pan that would need to be sealed.  He also cleared the over flow pipe so make sure it was clear since we never experienced water dripping outside the house from this pipe since the installation of the unit.  The overflow pipe had been installed flush with the wall of the house so that the dripping was now being directed onto the porch and wall of the house.  Josh had to be called out again to extend the pipe away from the contact of the house.  It is now working satisfactorily.  The company still has to repair the crack in the ceiling and we are awaiting resolution with that problem.  Throughout this entire ordeal we are so impressed with Josh W. and his professionalism as well as Denise in the office.  Denise would call us back during a holiday weekend and even when the office was closed during the weekend.  They were exceptional people to work with and we always felt that our problems and concerns were given immediate priority and attention.  We would highly recommend Josh W. as your technician and Denise as your go to person in the office..  You will not be sorry!</text>

When LA felt like you were inside an oven, of course our air conditioner suddenly stopped. We called JW Heating and at first they said they were so busy (I am sure that was true) that they couldn't get to me until the next day. But, they called back and said it was possible to send someone out today. SO HAPPY> Victor came and quickly identified the problem. He took photos to explain everything clearly. And he got everything up and running again. He gave us options without being pushy for the long run and we made our choice. Thanks for saving us on a VERY HOT day.< /review>

<text>Kenton L. from JW Heating and Air came to our home today to give us an estimate on replacing our outdated split HVAC system. We are still in the process of getting a couple of other bids before we make the final decision on which company to use, but I will say that Kenton was very thorough, knowledgable, helpful in answering all of our questions, and we understand why their reputation is great in the industry: we saw and heard a snippet of the experience in Kenton L.!  I will say that JW Heating and Air is definitely in the running for us. I will update my review if/when we should decide to use JW Heating and Air. Thanks for the great consult, Kenton!</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Dustin arrived on time and was knowledgable and friendly. He provided us to all the information we needed and helped us make the best decision for our new air conditioning and heating units. He explained all the options, sizes, warrantees, etc, showing us a pamphlet to help visually understand the choices. The other company we had come out the day before did not do this. Dustin was thorough. I will refer JW to all my clients and friends.< /review>

This team sets a high bar for all professional contractors. Starting time at 7 am meant arriving early just in case with a well coordinated delivery of materials and crew. They were working by 7 sharp. In two and a half days they removed all the old ducting and furnace then installed a new furnace/HVAC  in the attic hanging from the rafters. Our home is approx 1700 sq ft one story and needed a larger intake and additional registers (thanks Ted for your expertise.) Craftsmanship was perfectly executed and cleanup passed the white glove test. Shawn was patient with our questions and explained everything clearly. The new Lennox variable stage is so quiet, this summer we say BRING IT ON!!!</Text>

Ted came out today to provide an estimate/proposal on a replacement Lennox unit on our rooftop.  I've already secured estimates from two other contractors and their prices were a bit cheaper in price but lacking in details and specifics.  I've had experience with contractors who would low ball price but would either make expensive mistakes in judgment or drown me with change orders that would cost me more in time and money in the long run.  Ted spent the most time at my house (3 hours!) to diligently research my situation, understand the issues and write the proposal onsite.  He also explained in extraordinary detail what had to be done and the menu of equipment options that were available.  Extremely impressed by his thoroughness and honesty.  I haven't made up my mind yet but my wife and I have a heavy lean towards Ted and JW Heating.< /text>

<Review>Very thorough, competent, and knowledgable estimator to a new whole house central HVAC system. Four stars because they were more expensive than other estimates because they use only high end high SEER equipment, which is not what we need in this old house. If we were adding HVAC to a newer home we would certainly use this company!<//Review><time>1520385369964</time><user_id>115756072907844289961<//user_id>< resp>

<text>We had a 25 yr old furnace that needed to be replaced.  I had had HVAC service in the past with JW and was impressed by their professionalism and organized manner. The same technician returned to look at our furnace md system.  He was able to call one of his supervisors who came out on a Saturday morning to look at the system and give an estimate. Another tech came out a week before scheduled service to make sure they knew how many vents they were working with.  The morning of the service Ishmael and his team were at my home promptly at 7 am and began work.  They checked in often and when they realized all of our old ducting was compromised by previous work in our basement, they called Jeffrey who came by within an hour to evaluate and give a price for the ducting ( which really had been crushed and collapsed). They finished the main installation on time and came back promptly the next work day to co okeyw the ducting.  Throughout the technicians were courteous .  The office kept in constant communication via phone and email throughout the process from start to finish.  I am pleased with the team and the finished product< /text>< Pics>

Paul A. (marketing Mgr) The first face of JW. In all visits low key but knowledgeable and unflappable to my pre-hire demanding questions. Very courteous. No lag in replies to followup questions throughout process.The work-boots on the ground were more that just workers. They all seemed to work together and all were eager to answer or reassure us as the the process in progress, despite being in the midst of a very arduous task  and a dusty work environment. Overly concerned to homeowner's floors. Our crew of Joe, Adolfo, Gus, and Ricky were mindful of our questions and were non-stop in the stalling process. Cleaned our yard by watering away the fine dust and also sweeping. Their communications to us was neither impolite or aloof (as other professionals might tend to be). Joe and Adolfo particularly took their time in politely explaining matters while they worked---- as I was a constant overseer.</Text>

< Review>
My AC died at the beginning of the 98 degree heat wave in LA. I have a contract with JW Heating and Air and so they squeezed me in 4 days after I called. I would have hoped for something sooner as my indoor thermostat read 87 degrees! But, OK, they were really busy. Ruddy checked my system and determined that I needed refrigerant (sp?) which he did not have readily available. He was thorough and I was very happy with his service. He even left me his number in case I had trouble before he was able to get back to complete the job. Fortunately, the AC has come back, although inconsistently and clearly needs the refrigerant. I am hoping JW will follow through next week, as promised.< /Review>

In calling Costco's third-party HVAC servicer, JW Heating & Air, I was very specific with the receptionist that I had already arranged to have Home Depot install my HVAC system, but would consider one last quote if JW could match or beat the price. I informed the receptionist that I needed a 3 ton Lennox heating and ac unit, insulation added, installation, and all new ducts (with permits) to be either $13,500 or lower. After putting me on hold for about 10 minutes, and speaking with an adviser, the receptionist guaranteed they could get close or beat it. Accordingly, I set-up my appointment with them hoping not to waste my time by another "car salesman".

Surprise surprise, when JW heating & air came to my house, it was $2,300 moreover than the quoted $13,500, and that was only IF I was a costco member (15% rewards card), executive member with 2% back, and had the costco Visa card with 2% back! I expected more from a Costco affiliated service!< /Review>

A.MA.ZING!!  From Ted's patience in explaining everything to me beforehand, to Joe and Fernando's care in removing my old heater and making sure EVERYTHING was in order with my new one, my experience with JW was nothing short of spectacular.  Even though it's been almost two weeks since the work was completed, I'm still in awe with just how easy and stress-free the entire process was -- simply put, the one and only time I've actually enjoyed working with a contractor ever.  I've sung JW's praises to everyone since and will more than happily recommend them to anyone who needs HVAC work done in their home.  Thanks, guys!</text>

I had JW Heating and Air install a new Lennox heating and air system in our home, and I would highly recommend their services, from Joe to Jose and his team, Ismael and Flipie.  Jose's team were punctual, friendly, and meticulous in their work.  Joe followed up and spent personal time to confirm the installation and answer some technical questions after the install.   At the end of each day they were very careful to make sure the work area was clean and no mess was left.

Overall the experience was excellent.  They delivered on everything that Oscar Villafana promised in our initial negotiation for the job.  They listened, communicated and performed.  All the special traits of a well managed and experienced team of employees.

Being in the Development and Construction Management business for over 25 years and hiring numerous construction trades/contractors to perform multiple technical projects, I would definitely put JW Heating and Air at the top of my go to list.<//review>

< review>
Called to set up appt for estimate on ductless mini split system.  Was disappointed when told starting $$ 6500, regardless of btu, size, make, etc.  I questioned how could she determine the cost if she doesn't know how many zones, model, cooling/heating, etc  I might be interested in?    She then said JW only installs Daikin and does not install nor service any other system.  That ended my conversation.  She offered no advice   and left me feeling, why did I call?  Unfortunate for JW Heating Co.<//review>

<Text>Very happy with the work and service performed by JW Heating and Air. We did a brand new installation of a package unit along with new ductwork, and they were so professional from start to finish. The company's warranty package is pretty impressive, which is so important when making such a huge investment.</Text></record></dataset><record>

JW Heating gave me the best price on a full heating and air system.  The installers were professional snd fast.  They routed the ductwork so it was out of the way, and they were very clear in the work area.

I would highly recomend them.< /review>

<Review>About me, I'm a very detail oriented person who must have work done professionally, cleanly and accurately with great attention to aesthetic.  I need straight lines, accurate specs and it MUST LOOK GOOD.  My review is both 5 stars and 3 stars...thus I gave this company a 4.

5 Stars to Joe Howard and his team: Rene (carpenter/stucco), Gus, Miguel, and Adolfo (A/C install).  If you hire JW Heating and Air make sure to schedule Joe Howard and his team for the installation.

Joe is a hard worker, respectful, clean, easy to talk to and no-nonsense about doing a professional job.  If something is wrong, whatever it is, he'll fix it.  He won't try to explain it away.  He sees what you see.  If it's not professionally done he'll make sure to have it re-done and done right.

3 stars to JW Heating and Air because the first team they sent me.  Whoever did the scheduling sent a team who never ever came to my home.  I had to re-explain what was talked about with Joe Howard.  I was stressed the entire day and when they finished I found a ton of aesthetic issues.  And although that team was courteous and nice, they were sometimes loud and laughing while working.  They were a young team, did parts of the job rushed (there was a lot to do bc I never had A/C) and without concern of how it would look.  I had to act as my own contractor and constantly check on them.
At the end of the day there were things done wrong and that did not look good.   I was very unhappy.  On top of it all I was paying a lot of $$$ and I was stressed.  It's not right to be paying so much money, be put in such a stressful position and have to work as my own contractor.  When I hire a professional company I expect them to do the entire job, do it right and make sure I'm happy for the entire process.

On a positive note - JW Heating's Kris - who takes care of the rebates is on top of things and I really appreciate that they took care of all rebate processing for me.

And at the end of the day, I was very happy with how the job was completed.

The Bottom Line - Make sure to have Joe Howard at your walk through and make sure the scheduler knows you must have him.  Even if you have to wait another week or two.

Thank you Joe Howard and Team!

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I highly recommend JW Heating and Air.  We completely replaced our furnace, AC unit, and all ductwork.

I met with 3 HVAC folks and was very disappointed with them.  They all immediately sized the system without doing the Manual J calc, based on my home's square footage.  I knew from my research on the web that this is completely wrong.

I turned to Angie's list and found JW Heating and Air had over 1,000 A ratings, and figured we'd try them out.  Ted Ceausu from JW Heating and Air was great to work with. Very professional and before he left, said he'd be doing the manual J calculations and then room calcs to figure out the amount of air-flow and duct size we would need in each room.

Woohoo!  I didn't even need to ask about it!

Their cost was right in the middle between the lowest and highest bids I received.  But everything Ted said, was great. We have a home built in 1936, and he is experience working with other historic homes and provided us a vendor for reproduction grates that he was able to include in our quote.

But it's really the attention to details that made all the difference.  Since antique style grates have much bigger openings, he let us know that they would spray paint the inside of the registers black to ensure we wouldn't see any silver metal when looking inside.  This compared to my neighbor who said that when she asked her HVAC installer to do the same, he said his job stopped at the installation. She had to paint her own.

The crew was all very polite and they kept our house very clean as all new holes needed to be cut for all the registers as the existing ones were too small or not well-placed.

Best of all, when the state inspector came, he said our 5-ton system was the best he'd every tested as far as leakage, at 4 1/2%.   Avoid any contractor who doesn't want you to get permits or inspections.  Paying for that is like money in-the-bank over the long haul to insure your systems was installed properly.

We've had the system for two weeks, and so-far-so good with the AC.

Again, JW Heating and AIR is the best!< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Jeff and his team are a simply fantastic and I could not recommend them enough.  We got a number of bids from different places.  We wanted a complete HVAC system and we wanted to best brand for our home.  We also wanted a mini split for the back, and I also wanted the best brand for this.  Jeff’s estimate was not the cheapest, but very reasonable, and his bid felt the most thorough and honest.  He spent over two and a half hours at the house, looking around the attic, and the entire house.  He made his suggestions, and talked us through what would take place.  He said it would take about three days—btw, one of the bids told us it would take one day, which I see now would have been impossible).  They were removing all of the ductwork and replacing it with new ducts everywhere, installing all new vents and creating a brand new vent, moving the AC to the roof, an putting in an entirely new furnace in the attic, and creating an up to code drainage system.    Anyway, Jeff communicated clearly what our options were and he assured us that we would be taken care of.   We ultimately went with Lennox for our HVAV and a Mitsubishi mini split for the outside studio.

Jeff called me the night before the job to tell me that he was upgrading my Lennox from a 3-ton to a 4 because his load calculations revealed my house needed it.  And he was picking up the extra cost.

When his crew arrived it was like staying in a 5 star hotel.  You don’t have to worry about anything.   It was at least 6 guys.  Also, they are very smart.  While they were in the attic, they even noticed some hazards that they alerted me to, which I immediately addressed.  And each person worked hard, efficiently and they took great care of our house.  NO MESS.    Jeff was popping in and out to make sure everything was being done well.  Our house was not an easy install, but they never complained, at least not to us.

In summation, I would go to JW Heating and Cooling before anyone.  You won’t get better.  These guys covered everything and I am thrilled.

Thanks Jeff,
John and Gaby< /Review></record>
