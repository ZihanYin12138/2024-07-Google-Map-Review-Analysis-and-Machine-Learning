The false fire alarms are bloodcurdling. We didn’t believe the issue could be as bad as past reviews said, and now we seriously regret moving here. The alarms go off on average 3x per month. Sometimes, they’re blasting for the whole day every hour. Last night, they were howling starting at 1am and through the next day. Mind-piercing, insane alarms at 100 decibels that go on for 5-10 minutes until the fire department arrives. It’s damaging our hearing-- I can't imagine the permanent mental and physical problems it's causing for pets and children. People are leaving to stay in hotels!!! No reimbursement. The bureaucratic management team is incapable of fixing it or communicating. They are nice, but they just talk in circles and apologizing without actually getting anything done. This is the case with anything aside from the alarms too. For example, the new gym reservation system is discriminatory and confusing to navigate. Residents are complaining non-stop, there are TONS of reservation software solutions on the market, yet zero change. Just excuses, apologies, and useless emails. DO NOT MOVE HERE!< /Text>

<username>Sabrina B<//username>< Review>
My family has lived here for a few years enjoying the walkability of downtown and quick freeway access. They've always had events in the residential lounge free of charge until management recently added a fee.🙁 I'm assuming the fee was added because the lounge was recently updated. Not really clear on that but I must admit it looks very nice and was perfect for our event. I added a few pictures so you all can see the changes and how spacious it is. Along with the stove, refrigerator, and sink, their is a microwave inside of the peninsula for everyones convenience. Disclaimer: 90's themed decorations not included.<//Review>

<text>Update to my review below:

Over 48 hours since the last break-in/security incident and management has yet to inform residents. Not only are they unable to keep the facility secure, they continue to bury their head in the sand and not let residents know what actions are being taken to  prevent another incident. It raises the question as to what else they're hiding from tenants.

------------------------

- Still feeling unsafe as break-ins continue to happen here - even during the "courtesy patrol" in broad daylight, business hours when the team is here.

Would love if the management team would invest in security instead of cosmetics and lip service.

--------------------------

We've been residents for almost 2 years at this point and the constant changes in management and corresponding decrease in quality of life is clear. Looking at Google reviews we are clearly not the only tenants impacted & disappointed by the lack of responses to address it.

- Inconsistent & disruptive fire alarm has created serious quality of life issues (multiple night disruptions during work weeks & weekends)
- Physical security concerns & lack of response
- Multiple incidents deeming community notification (Messages dated to the community in November & January clearly indicate inadequate protocols in place)
- Package delivery system is inadequate - many of our deliveries are still dropped off in unsupervised areas today (adjacent to Luxer, in hallway, etc. that have resulted in stolen packages over the holidays)
- Poor facility management
- Broken elevators for weeks at a time - difficulty for groceries & parking at lower levels require walking up unprotected pedestrian ramp in parking garage
- Gym upkeep has been lacking (broken treadmills, cable system accessories, no towels / sanitizing wipes, water etc.)
- Delayed responses to service requests</text>< Pics>

<gmap_id>0x808f80b041d3d1fb:0x6a25f3d54b96b434< /gmap_id><review>Like others before me, again just stating facts here so that others can make informed decisions before renting from Domain. I'll list my positives and negatives and let you make your own informed decisions.

DO read all of the reviews online, as I thought when we rented here that people must have been crazy, on the surface this place looks amazing, but know that a lot of what other people are writing are very true. So I will just leave you with my own experiences.

1.) Location - The location of the building is close to downtown Oakland. At first it was great, walking distance to Bart, restaurants etc. However at night its another story. You are one block from a freeway, and West Oakland, a few blocks from a major police station, and near so many government buildings that attract homeless, transients, and deadbeats. I can't tell you how many times I saw flashing police lights, sirens from fire trucks, hookers on the street corner, along with people yelling and screaming from the street below. I was on the 6th floor, and nose echo's up the building.

2.) The fire alarms - I thought there was no way that could be an issue still a year before that someone had posted before I moved in. Oh its still an issue, and be ready to go downstairs at 3,4,5 in the morning to the street level. Oh and if its not this building that wakes you up, then it will be the even worse one across the street, as they have issues to.

3.) The elevators. Get used to walking the stairs. Great for exercise, but honestly I could tell you how many times that they actually worked. The issue with the building is that construction started in 2007/8 and then stopped due to the financial crisis. The building was left open and unfinished, and thus with rust and rain it has wrecked havoc on the building systems ever since, on top of that the two elevators on D block are interior elevators but in an exterior setting. They will never work properly.

4.) Security. This one definitely goes with number 1. Security is pretty much a joke here. The cameras don't capture any footage, cars wait at the garage doors to follow people in to either park for free, or steal what they can, doors are propped open or people wait by the entries to sneak in as someone leaves. I had my bicycle tire stolen from a locked bike in a locked bike room in the basement. I myself had to alert the team that the door had been broken once, the next time I went down the door was completely open and bingo my tire gone. Oh and insurance won't cover it, so basically don't leave anything anywhere unless its in your locked apartment and even then its probably not safe.

5.) Packages. Don't expect amazon to deliver your packages. If they can't get in the building, they will leave it in the alley by the front door. If you order one of those food boxes, outside on the front door feeding the homeless. Instacart may make it to the lobby, but even then I saw it sitting there for 24-48hours rotting. My wife lost so many items that never made it into their "secure lockers" people don't pick up their packages, so the lockers are full, and then sometimes items make it into the mail room, but again only if someone leaves the door open - great security.

6.) Pets and cleanliness - Not sure why pet owners with dogs can't clean up after their pet has an accident and pees in the elevator or poos on the floor, but somehow the place remains a mess.

Better stuff.
1.) B block is probably the best being in the middle, but then you are look at neighbors on either side. Units on the end seem like they are the bomb, views of the sunset, off a quiet alley, exterior wrap around balconies.
2.) The roof top BBQ grill works very well, and the amenity is great.
3.) The gym has some amazing equipment. When/If it reopens
4.) Lots of open parking, never had an issue finding a space, and if you don't live in the building you can park for free too, just follow someone in. :)
5.) Staff was pretty helpful most of the time. If you caught them on a good day, they were happy to help.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Extremely bad apartments. Worst management when it comes to taking care of the building spanning from call box, key fob to FIRE ALARMS!!!!

There are false fire alarms 2-3 times a week and they have not done anything about it at all. The fire department has been fining them but they still won't fix that.< /Text>< name>

She was very patient with me throughout the whole tour and was able to answer all of my questions. I definitely recommend her for anyone visiting this property. Domain was a nice community but not enough amenities. The office was great but I decided to lease at another community. Thank you Julia for all of your help!< /text>< Pictures>

<userid>117141667952789867652<//userid><Time>1603484315734</Time><Text>My partner and I just moved here in August.

App/movein process:
Easy. Simple. Did everything online in a single day.

Office staff:
I toured with Julia, Asst Mgr. She was very accommodating (I'm also a property mgr so I know I can be a bit difficult), friendly, and helpful.

Tahlia helped with the app process. Super friendly, she was new but said it straight up which is always smart, and definitely helpful.

Desmond, I barely worked with but was certainly polite and helpful the few times we did communicate.

Mgr is Brittany, I had an issue while moving, unrelated to Domain, and she was both helpful and supportive even though she'd never met me before.

The unit: I have a 795 sqft 1bed which I LOVE. The bedroom is a bit small, so if you've got a king don't expect sidetables. Fits a queen and 2 sidetables with a little extra space. Lg bathroom with 2 doors, we covered the door to bedroom w/ shelving. Kitchen is open which I love, we just purchased an island. Built in desk in the corner makes my day every time I use it. Not a lot of lighting, you'll need plenty of lamps.

Parking: Great price, always good spots available. My last place was $270 but much cheaper rent. To be clear to mgmt: I would not have moved here if parking was any more expensive so I wouldn't suggest increasing.

Utilities: I haven't received yet. A bit worried about the rates considering some of the other posts, so we'll see..

Property: The 2 courtyards w/ bbqs and firepits are amazing. One day we'll get to use the rooftop and gym as well, not their fault. Yes, sometimes there is dog pee on the concrete - not mgmt fault. It's unrealistic to expect power washing daily. More realistically -- residents with pets (such as myself) need to monitor their animals and prevent peeing inside the property. They provide bags at exits which is appreciated.

Location: YAS.. althought for now a lowercase yas due to Covid, but there's still bars and restaurants who've opened up with outdoor seating. Bart 2 blocks away, Flax Art Supply 2 blocks away, not as close to a grocery store as I'd like but a short drive.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I stopped by Domain Oakland to inquire about a 2 bedroom apartment. I have to say the management and leasing were great. They were kind and professional and really took their time to provide options that worked best for me. The property is also making some nice upgrades!

I really appreciate the Domain Employees who work hard to ensure that the building is clean and safe, that the facilities are well cared for, and that the community is a place where neighbors can connect and feel comfortable. The management personnel is very friendly and helpful in dealing with any maintenance or information requests, and the security and maintenance staff are really great as well! The location can't be beat either, as it is a very quick walk to BART and downtown Oakland.<//Review>

IMPRESSED! Now I will admit that after reading a few of the reviews I was a little worried, but I am very pleased about my decision to tour the property and find out for myself.

I recently came to visit the property and had a tour with Justin, who is the Property Manager. I expressed that it was very important to me that if I was going to stay somewhere and pay good money - I needed to know I was heard as/if things arise.

As we walked through the property Justin was SO nice, and so open and honest with me and my fiance about our concerns and most importantly their course of action as a team to address things.

I was completely impressed and completely pleased with my experience touring the property, and meeting Justin.

Fingers-crossed my love and I will move-in soon.<//Review>

If I could give this place 10 stars I would!

I have to say, moving across the country is never an easy task, but Justin Giles has made this process so much smoother!

It was fantastic to see how attentive he was in taking care of my needs, concerns, and even wants! The professionalism and sincerity that he has shown me is truly incomparable for a resident who has not even officially moved in yet. Really looking forward to living at Domain Oakland for years to come!<//text>

<Text>I came to the building to sign my lease (online lease done remotely) and tour the building. Made an appointment a couple days in advance and no one showed up to the office. After 15 minutes, I left. If they can’t follow through on taking your money, I can imagine how bad the service is otherwise.

Also there is no reliable way to contact the leasing office now as I try to get my money back.< /Text></record>

<Review>I lived here from 2013-2015 and now I just moved back! I am a Developer and will have work here again in Oakland for the next couple years so decided to move back to The Domain. Julia was very helpful and made the process go smoothly and stress free. Being from Oakland originally I think it's easy to complain about how expensive it is to rent an apartment these days. I think the Domain is very reasonable considering what else is out there and absolutely love the location for commuting. Right next to hwy 980 which allows quick access to freeways going in every direction. Tons of new restaurants and bars to try in the area. Couldn't be more excited.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I’d give zero stars if I could. I can’t even begin to tell you about my lease signing process and how ridiculous, unresponsive, and unhelpful the staff were. Not to mention my lease was messed up for an extended period of time and no follow up from them. There’s much more there but I don’t dare describe.

The main criticism, of which there are many, is I reported the fire sprinkler as leaking from my ceiling and onto my bed 19 hours ago (a steady leak not an infrequent drip) and nothing-NOTHING-has been done. Of course I was assured it was a priority and marked as an emergency for maintenance.

My bed is damp and I am sleeping on my couch. Convinced you shouldn’t live here? Don’t ever step foot onto this property. You’ll save yourself a lot of heartache and stress. Believe me.</text>

New update 03/22/19: Domain promised new updates inside the building that were exciting and would definitely improve everyone's experience, but for some reason they've decided to start with painting the outside of the building (something nobody cared about) an awful, ugly color. Also, our neighbor's apartment door was kicked in last night and as the police showed up, the Domain staff decided to leave for the day instead of helping with the situation. I cannot believe how bad it has gotten at this apartment complex and we are counting down the days until we can leave. Do yourself a favor and do not even inquire about an apartment at this complex. Management is a mess and unresponsive to emails and calls. We've been promised improvements for two years and things have only continued to get worse.

1 month ago:
continued promises of improvements coming to the community without any real action. Fire alarms go off very often and throughout the night, which is completely unacceptable. This has been an issue for the 1.5 years I’ve lived here. Apartments continue to be broken into and the entire complex no longer feels safe. I cannot wait until this lease is up and my family can move out of this terribly managed apartment complex. I’d also assume like others, we’ll have a hard time getting our deposit back when we leave. Do yourself a favor and do NOT sign a lease here.< /Review>

<Review>I absolutely love the location of this housing unit. I had the pleasure of touring the property with leasing agent Hanaya R. I'll start off by saying I was greeted by all the employees with a smile and really nice welcoming energy. Working with Hanaya was great, I absolutely loved how pleasant and knowledgeable she was of the area and all the perks that came along with living here in this area. She was able to answer all of my questions thoroughly (and I had plenty) :) I'll be working in the city so I really love the idea of Bart being so close for commuting back and forth. The property is getting nice upgrades and that's always a plus. I look forward to moving forward in this process. Thank you so much Hanaya It was such a pleasure working with you!< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
My apartment was broken into and my car stolen out of the parking lot within a week while living here. They also can barely get you your packages, and often when they are lost, you are expected to find them yourself as if it is your fault. The rent is rediculous for little to no amenities and there is literally no security on site for multiple hours in the morning. This results in people regularly hoping the fence and trying every door in the building in the hopes that someone left theirs unlocked. Honestly, you'd be better off just renting out a small house anywhere else in Oakland. Oakland PD officers literally knows this apartment building purely for the number of calls they get for break-ins here, and management has done little to nothing about it.<//Review>

The team at Domain will always try to assist locate misplaced or lost packages as best as possible and when we are available to help during office hours and depending on staffing availability that day.\n\nSecurity: There is security on site from 7pm-7am daily. we always encourage residents to contact local police should they see anything suspicious happening on the property. We also ask that residents be sure to lock their apartment door, not let anyone into the building that is loitering around and not share their access control devices with others or leaving them inside of their vehicles.\n\nWe will continue to implement ways to improve the community as best a possible.

Management is absolutely unresponsive and takes weeks to fulfill requests that typically take two days. The manager is absolutely rude to you and claims he will get the maintenance person to go but will not. We have to demand our services at least two to three times before they do anything about it. Free internet, an amenity they used to provide, has been taken away. DO NOT LIVE HERE<//review>

{'time': 1551389764477, 'text': "Hello Mark-\n\nThank you for taking the time to rate the community and provide feedback about your experience. To address some of your concerns:\n•\tWe completely understand the frustration as there was a night recently, that the heavy storm activity triggered the alarms in one area. We immediately had the entire system evaluated that next day and an upgrade has been approved.\n•\tOur neighbors as very important to us.  So yes, we will always do our best to provide updates and announcements to better serve and inform the community. There is courtesy patrol available onsite from 7pm-7am; 7days a week. We will continue to look into more ways to provide security at the community.\n•\tAs you know we provide two large package lockers, and a package room.  We work with carriers, but not all follow our package control policies. We always suggest that a signature is required and each neighbor track their parcel to ensure timely retrieval.  Often times, packages are left for days in the package lockers limiting locker space for new deliveries. We are also implementing a new monitored package room. We hope that this will help package overflow, however, neighbor responsibility and participation is highly important tool to achieve an effective package management system.\n•\tFirst, I am truly sorry that you were inconvenienced. Unfortunately, there are times that mechanical systems present unforeseen issues.  This was the case during the five days that there was an issue last month. The delay was related to the availability of parts, preventing a more expeditious resolution.  We are taking steps to avoid that in the future. During the time of this event, the team actively provided assistance to anyone needing help with carrying items up the stairs as well as staying late to assist residents.\n•\tWe have a great service team that does their best to ensure on-site amenities are kept up to a great standard. The community is fairly large and does require multiple areas to be maintained throughout the day. We truly appreciate it when residents inform us of areas that need to be touched up as we unfortunately cannot have eyes on every inch of the community all day.\n\nThanks again for having called Domain Oakland home and we hope that you'll continue to improvements around the community during your residency.\n\n-The Domain Oakland Team"}<//Resp>
<Review>We've been residents for almost 2 years at this point and the constant changes in management and corresponding decrease in quality of life is clear. Looking at Google reviews we are clearly not the only tenants impacted & disappointed by the lack of responses to address it.

- Inconsistent & disruptive fire alarm has created serious quality of life issues (multiple night disruptions during work weeks & weekends)
- Physical security concerns & lack of response
- Multiple incidents deeming community notification (Messages dated to the community in November & January clearly indicate inadequate protocols in place)
- Package delivery system is inadequate - many of our deliveries are still dropped off in unsupervised areas today (adjacent to Luxer, in hallway, etc. that have resulted in stolen packages over the holidays)
- Poor facility management
- Broken elevators for weeks at a time - difficulty for groceries & parking at lower levels require walking up unprotected pedestrian ramp in parking garage
- Gym upkeep has been lacking (broken treadmills, cable system accessories, no towels / sanitizing wipes, water etc.)
- Delayed responses to service requests<//Review></record>

I asked for Domain to address a rodent problem caused from overgrown privacy bushes outside my 2nd floor patio unit (pic) with no action taken, or response given. There are at minimum, several rodents nesting in there and it’s been weeks without anything attempted. Imagine paying $3k/month to have a family of rodents outside your bedroom window. You could if you sign at Domain.

In addition:

I moved my son into a unit here (his first apt) last week. This review details my experience so far, with the leasing team, and the move in.

My leasing consultant was Julia Mendoza. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Here are my complaints:
1). They took 3.5 days to approve the application,
AFTER all documents were submitted.
Submitted the appn on July 20 (Sat), gave income proofs by 21st,  wanted to move in on 27th. Called on Tues to check; Julia's assistant told me Julia was on leave, so if I could resend some documents, the assistant would get the approval by evening.
I immediately resent, but nothing happened.
I called again On Wed, Julia was in, she said I would get approval by evening.
Again nothing happened, called on Thurs, talked to Justin, got the approval on Thurs afternoon.
I had to call each day, and they behaved as though I was doing something wrong (for calling).
2). One more day to confirm move in: On Thurs, immediately after I got the application approved, I paid all amounts due and sent them proof of Renter's insurance.
They wouldn't confirm my Sat morning move until Fri late afternoon.
3). Dust all over the apartment, though they promised me that the apt would be recleaned before move in. We had to mop the floor, and sponge the counters in the kitchen and the bath room.< /text>

I'm sorry to hear that you felt we were not timely in the application process and that home at move in was not dusty.\n\nThe initial application process and approval can take anywhere from 24-72hrs, depending on the conditions of the approval, number of applicants involved as well as time of the week when applications are submitted. In the event there is a change such as a roommate add-on during the initial application process, this can delay an approval as screening and information on the lease would need to be changed and approved by management.\n\nRegarding the apartment condition at your son's specific time of move in, we discovered that the cleaning company hired had left the windows open after shampooing the carpet in order for air to circulate. This unfortunately allowed for some dust to come in overnight from outside.\n\nWe will use this experience to improve our processes and communication in the future.\n\nThanks again and we look forward to providing your son a great home during his residency here at Domain Oakland!"}< /Resp>< gmapID>

<review>I wish I could give 0 stars.
Since there seems to be no other way to contact the staff of this property other than writing a review on Yelp or google, thought I'd give this a shot. We have emailed 3 times now and called about 12, with no response or answer. We moved out over a month ago and have not received any correspondence at all on the status of our deposit or the amount. When we were informing them that we were not going to be renewing our lease and would be moving out (with over 60 days notice), they did not respond to our phone calls or emails of our notices and they were barely ever in the office. The only way I was able to get a hold of them was by going to the website and sending an email as if I were interested in being a new resident. They finally (a month after my first email) sent me the move-out request but it didn't even have the right apartment complex name on the form. It was an absolute nightmare trying to coordinate an inspection for us to move out and for them to update our correct rent amount for our final month. Absolutely horrible.

I live here now. I’m currently at work and miserable because our fire alarms went off ALL night. This is not even the first time I was up all night from false fire alarms. I heard someone say the heavy rain interferes with the alarm signals?

Also don’t get fooled by the nice coffee machine in the lounge. It is not well kept and often times does not work.

There’s also been a lot of issues with stolen packages and other security issues.<//Text>

I wish I could give less then one star here. We have been residents for 2 years and this place is not only a rip off but has extremely stressful conditions here with poor management. Here is my list of problems throughout the 2 years that our family has had to go through..
1. Excessive loud fire alarms that go off at anytime. Usually during the late or early mornings when your asleep they go off about once a month or twice . And has never gotten any better.
2. Security is inadequate,  we had our truck and bike stolen in the garage that we  pay $ 160 for a month. The security guard , security camera did not see it. How does a huge truck get stolen from right beneath you and not even the 24 security camera not see it?
3. A sprinkler system went off in my children’s room for no apparent reason . They got wet and the fire alarm was going off.
4. Cheap appliances that break easily.
5. Rude neighbors that never say hi to you. They look almost scared that other people exist.
Not recommended for anyone worth children .
6. Be prepared to loose your packages, have them stolen and have to pay a fee
If you don’t get them over 24 hours.
6. Managements is new, never in the office barely picks up the phone calls or is even present during normal business hours. Not to mention they are rude and also never greet you. It feels like your in a corporate office not a home .
7. They increase the rent every year as well
8. My least favorite, the elevators often do not work. We live on the 5th floor and one time they were broken for over a week. With two kids we had to go up and down stairs walk all across the other building to use the other elevator. If you are handicapped, this place does not cater for you in times of emergency.<//Text>

<Review>Save yourself some time and trouble, don't ever go to Domain.

I usually don't write online comments but Domain has treated me and my husband so unfairly that I don't have a choice but telling people about it.

First of all, I want to start by saying that Domain was well managed before Greystar management took over. We really enjoyed our first 2 years there with FPI management.

When Greystar took over the building, they literally made our LIVES MISERABLE and many people left.

Greystar do not care about their residents, it's only about profit and they are totally unprofessional. Below is our story:

RENT INCREASE:
> We lived at Domain for 3 years. When Greystar took, they RAISED OUR RENT BY almost $800 at the end of our lease! We went from about $2200/month to $3000/month = a 30% increase.
> WORST PART IS: once we decided to move, THEY PUT OUR UNIT OUT ON THE MARKET FOR $2600...

= Their renewal price was totally arbitrary as our rate was way higher than market rate.

AMENITIES GOING SOUTH:
> First thing that Greystar did when they took over the building, they CUT OUT OUR FREE INTERNET (and told us that it was for our best interest) even though it's part of the reason why we renewed our first lease
> They changed our mail storage system and as a result we had several PACKAGES STOLEN.
> The FIRE ALARM is broken and WENT OFF several times in the middle of the night -even though that was an issue before-
> It's DIRTY - they let dog pee inside the building, and don't clean
> The day we moved out they BLOCKED OUR MOVING DOCK even though it is available to residents

TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT:
> Right before I left the building, the management team drove me so crazy that I had to take pills to calm my nerves. Every time I was trying to get a MEETING with them (whether it's a walk through or to give my keys back), they either WERE NEVER PREPARED OR STOOD ME UP.
> The day I gave my keys back I had to take a day off from work and Domain MADE ME WAIT 40 MINUTES IN MY EMPTY UNIT for the walk through and never showed up!!! They left the building without telling me and I had to come back another day

I have many other bad stories to tell about this building but I'd rather stop here.

Justin the manager is very nice but I had such a terrible experience... The worst I ever had... I want to forget about Greystar for the rest of my life. I WOULD NEVER GO LIVE THERE EVER AGAIN.

I now moved to another building managed by FPI in uptown and I'm very very happy.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1557410002794, 'text': 'Hello Julie- We are disappointed to see that you did not have the best experience here at Domain Oakland.

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>The leading person I had originally set up my appointment with was on lunch when my appointment came around. When we showed up, all the employees were joking around in the break room for a good 15-20 minutes. Once an employee finally came to help us, they were as rude as ever. When we said we needed to move in immediately, the response was "well that's not gonna happen". We basically had to tell the girl we were going to apply so she wouldn't feel like her time was wasted. While looking at the unit, she was texting the whole entire time. The only reason I gave 1 star is because the apartments sell themselves.  Not one employee is helpful. Brittany and Danielle have to be the two worst people I have ever came across in this apartment search. Would not recommend this community to anyone. Oh and there was a constant natural gas smell in the leasing office and lobby, so that should make you feel safe.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x808f80b041d3d1fb:0x6a25f3d54b96b434< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've lived at the Domain for a year, and I absolutely love it.  It's my favorite apartment I've stayed in since I've moved to the Bay Area a few years ago.  I just signed a lease to stay another year, and the management team (Jeremy and Gabriela) were absolutely fantastic.  They were incredibly helpful with making everything go so smoothly and easily.

Location:
The location is incredible.  The walk to Bart is so short and super safe because you can walk through a nice federal building and then through City Walk, making the commute a breeze.  It's right next to lots of restaurants and bars.

Parking:
So easy.  There's always parking available in the garage, and it's safe and secure.  You never have to worry.

Front desk/staff:
Everyone is very kind and helpful, and they'll work with you to help accommodate your needs any way they can.

Units:
Nice and modern, spacious, and an amazing place to call home.

Amenities:
The gym is wonderful, the package lockers make deliveries so easy, and they have a great yoga studio.

Thoughts on other reviews:
The fire alarms are really not a problem anymore.  They used to go off sometimes up to a few months ago, but the building management solved the issue.  Also, it's really not true that the new management is unhelpful -- I've had a 5-star experience with them, and they went above and beyond to make sure I got everything I needed.  I think the other comments might be talking about the transition period when the new management was first taking over.  Of course, with a transition, you have to be a little patient because it's a massive undertaking, but now, everything is a well-oiled machine.  Don't listen to the negative reviews -- I couldn't be happier about living at Domain<//text>< pictures>

I have lived in this building for over a year, we thought when greystar management took over, things would get better. Oh how wrong we were, if fact, things got several times worse. Besides prices skyrocketing, while amenities were cut, service is terrible and worst of all, safety has decreased significantly. Since Greystar took over, I have had over $4000.00 worth of items stolen from secure areas of the building including several packages and other property. Many of these thefts occurred under a surveillance camera, but the management company has yet to check the cameras to assist in learning who the perpetrators are. Service and maintenance requests disappear into an abyss. Every time I ask for help, I am told someone will get back to me, but no one ever does. They love to give the run around. What’s worse is that the break ins have started, several of my neighbors have experienced having their homes completely ransacked, and have been robbed blind. Odd since, it seems the intruders has a key, maybe an inside job? Something is seriously wrong with this building and more so with this management company.< /Text>

Turns out Domain can’t even keep track of the fact that I paid my last month’s rent and are trying to take that back through my deposit. Terrible accounting! They are also trying to charge me $135 to paint an apartment that was in great shape - I didn’t even hang anything on the walls in the few months I lived there.

<text>I only gave one star in order to post this review; my true rating is a negative 0.

I've lived at Domain Oakland since June, which is when Greystar Properties took over.  From day 1, it was one lie after another.  I didn't post a comment at that time because I tried to give the new property owners the benefit of doubt and a chance to make things right.  But nothing has changed.   As a matter of fact it keeps getting worse.

If you ignore these reviews, like I did and truly regret, be prepared to have your packages stolen or misplaced for weeks.

Also, Be prepared to pay tax on your rent and parking, yet this property is not on Alemeda County or the City of Oakland tax record which is very odd.  Maybe they're using a different name and or address.  It's being looked into and I can't wait to find out the end results.

You should be prepared to pay $70.45 a month for trash.  Yes, $70.45 monthly!!! When I questioned management about this, I was told every resident pays the same amount of $70.45.  I know homeowners, as well as, others renting property in Oakland that are not paying this amount.  So what are we paying for? To find out, I called the trash company.  I was told Domain Oakland pays $5000 a month for trash.  Now this is a building of about 277+/- units.  If management was honest when he told me everyone pays $70.45, then we are pay a total of $19,514.65 for trash a month.  WHY????  Even the trash company agreed $75 a month is too much!! Again, I am having this matter looked into as well.

This is a place that doesn't care about the clients, and will rob you blind!!!!!  I will forward and post this information everywhere I can, until something is done.</text><resp>{'time': 1541144947129, 'text': 'Hello Jackqueline,\n\nThank you for your feedback.

Justin Giles was super fantastic in helping me find a suitable apartment at Domain. I came in early on a Monday morning before work and asked if I can quickly view a studio and 1 bedroom. Justin was very understanding and I was able to see everything I needed to in under 30 mins. He then suggested two apartments that fit my preferences and emailed me the quotes. I came back the next day after work and was able to get the lease signing process started right away. I completed the lease agreement in about 30 mins at home around 8 pm and surprisingly Justin approved everything right away!

<Text>The staff tried to take money from us at every opportunity (forgetting keys etc.). It was annoying.

The most disturbing thing happened after we moved out. I received my deposit back, less $135 for a professional cleaning fee. We only lived there for 5 months, and when we moved, we left the place spotless. When I inquired about the fee, the staff member explained that their policy is to charge every tenant this fee. If the tenant complains about it and can produce evidence of using a professional cleaning service, they will then deduct this amount from the $135 fee. This is a pretty clear violation of state law. I eventually was able to get them to refund the fee with a threatening letter, but honestly...

I would avoid renting from this group.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1518462837491, 'text': "Hello Brooks Mason,\n\nMy name is Marcus Thomson and I am the manager of Domain.

<text>These comments from the "Owner" Marcus Thomson are actually laughable.  What are these responses?  You strive to give residents a great living environment?  You are the problem.  It is you lying and deceiving the residents.  Providing apartments in poor condition when I moved in and then trying to charge me an exorbitant amount upon moving out.  Everything is a battle with YOU!  You, Marcus make living in the Domain unpleasant and what, just to sneak FPI an extra dollar profit behind the owners back?

Donuts on Fridays were taken away, Breakfast on Tuesday was taken away, Yoga and Meditation classes were taken away, the shared area was free when I moved in and now you charge a fee to use the space.  All the good things that convinced me to move in are now gone and only YOU remain, which is why I will be moving out.  Just to not have to look at your ugly face everyday will make the pain of moving worth it.

I pity any future residents that are forced to deal with you.  You are manipulative, coniving and always trying to stretch the truth of situations by demanding evidence of promises that were made.  BE GONE MARCUS BE GONE!!< /text><user>101281369132479475897</user>< Time>

The parking garage is not regulated and anyone can park there. My car was broken into last month and the security cameras don't work. They've taken every amenity away and the last was the internet that we now have to pay for, with no rent concession. The "business center" printer never works and the internet is touch and go.

Completely agree with what others have said. If I could give zero stars I would. There are so many things that are wrong with this building that it's tough to decide where to start! Firstly, the management company is utterly useless. They are unresponsive and clearly do not care about resident well-being. Apartment design and fixtures are so poor. Doors don't latch properly. Locks don't lock or unlock properly. Bathroom light switch is behind the door which you push into the bathroom. Imagine going to the bathroom at night and having to deal with that. Terrible. The management company has duped the residents out of free internet, which was a key selling point for years because there is basically no cell service in the building. Packages disappear from the mailroom.. to no reply from management. I could write 10 more points on this but I'll stop here.</Review>

There are a lot of things I'd change about this place, but the rent isn't out of line for the area, the management is improving, and it's a safe, secure building with some nice perks (including free att high speed internet). So while there is room for improvement (maintenance response time, mandatory trash valet service) this place is a good place to call home. It's close to the BART, restaurants, bars and both Uptown and Old Oakland. Even Jack London is just a 20 minute walk away. I love the area.</Text>

<Text>I would give zero stars if I could.  For the price, there are so many better places to live within walking distance and all around the bay area.  When I first moved in, it was very nice, but new building management (Marcus) is extremely cheap and has removed many programs and perks of the building and went so far as to refuse to assist me when my unit was infested with ticks when I returned from a vacation in Chicago in the middle of winter, claiming it was probably from the airplane.  Just looking at him you can tell he is shaddy.  Former management was much friendly and more effective.  I would NOT suggest this place to anyone ever unless you want to hate where you live and looking at Marcus' face every time you come home.

In addition to this, there will be flies in your home all spring, summer and fall if you leave your window or patio door open.  This place has had a nonstop bug problem since I moved in and the critters will come into your apartment

O yea, and fire alarms go off constantly and are insanely loud.  I have never experienced such displeasure and they've gone off multiple times in a day while I am at work and my poor puppy is subject to these insanely loud fire alarms that go off in every room of your apartment.  It is unbearable when I am home to the point of having to leave the building and wait for the alarms to stop and these alarms have gone off in the middle of the night and take forever to get turned off.< /Text>< pics>

<text>About to initiate legal action for Domain (under new management company Greystar) failing to return my deposit per California law, as others have highlighted on multiple review platforms already. Generally, Greystar appears to be running this property as a resident scam where efforts are centered around signing new residents abound, then all basic forms of communication end there. In Greystar taking over, I've seen everything from supplies disappearing, to dirtier trash chute area, to dirtier common areas, to maintenance failure - pretty dramatic change and shocking how clueless these folks appear to be. DO NOT MOVE THERE.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
Domain has changed. Ever since new management (Grey Star) has taken over a few months ago, it's been a horrible experience with 1) no hot water for 2 days, 2) taking away free internet, 3) missing packages and moving them to the bike room(wth?), and many other horrible things. Specifically on the internet, it was a huge selling point for us when we decided to live here. Without any warning, they tell us they are going to cancel the internet for OUR benefit. Seriously?! Many tenants filled out a petition hoping management would listen. Instead, they send out another email saying the exact things as before: we hear you. we want to improve the property for your benefit. Really?! If you really heard us and want to improve for our benefit, then you would continue the internet service OR at least give us a discount. So ridiculous.</Review>

He reassured me that in my absence, the car was in good hands and called to make sure he delivered it in a safe spot with surveillance camera coverage. No one looks forward to towing their car, but if you need a tow, i would recommend them any time, any day!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Customer service was excellent. Juan was very helpful and efficient in getting my car loaded up. He was willing to do the extra legwork to find a solution because of the unique positioning of my car at the time of his arrival. I'd definitely recommend Toro Roadrunners for future help with towing/ vehicle service.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Took extra special car not to scrape the bottom of my 2018 lowered m3 was not easy but found a way to make it happen with no incidents. I would recommend his services to anyone with a lowered high end sports car .</review><rating>5< /rating>< pictures>

Johnny was awesome! He picked me up in a timely fashion. He was courteous, informative and professional the whole trip to the car shop. He's truly passionate about his job. If I ever need another tow I hope I get Johnny again!</text>

Excellent customer service. The tow truck driver arrived at the earliest time estimated (about 40 minutes). His name was Chris and he was friendly and professional. The tow required special equipment and he was very quick to assemble an disassemble it. It was a bit pricey considering the distance was not far, however the service was excellent. Thanks again!<//Text>

This tow company towed my suv to Oakland Acura dealerships due to can’t start it’s 14.3 miles tow ! The lady in the phone quoted 3 to 4 hundred dollars ok when this tow driver slide my suv up the truck after one hour trying since he don’t have the wheels dolly n suv started sliding towards garage door frame I shouted out avoided the damage , he gives me a bill of 975$ n said he charges 250$ an hour, I was shocked n said the lady never told me anything like that! And he said I should negotiate with office ! When I called they r just making all kinds of excuses n said my insurance company will pay me back, what the heck’s! I felt totally bulled n insulted when I called again they just changed my phone! This is modern day robbing I will also contact consumer affairs California on Monday as well!<//Review>

< Review>
Thank You Tow Driver Mehenna for your patience when given  a wrong address in a busy Oakland Chinatown. Its great that we did not have to wait long like what we had endured a few days ago waiting for 3 hours from another tow company, it was bad experience. Mehenna  was so nice keeping us entertained during a bad traffic towards Pleasanton. I highly recommend his service/company. But I hope the office next time will quote us the correct charges. Luckily we were able to pay for it.</Review>

Toro Road Runner gave me a 45 to 50 minute ETA. 1 1/2 hours later, I called for an update and they told me another 15 mins. I ended up having to request another tow truck company.</review>

Highly recommend this to anyone that needs help with their driving skills. Bill's teaches you to be the best defensive driver behind the wheel and on the road. He goes in dept with your training to make sure that you will be perfectly fit for the road.< /Review>

<Text>I wanted to start driving again, after not having been behind the wheel for over 25 years. I'm SO glad that I contacted Bill's Defensive Driving School for some driving lessons. Paul is an amazing instructor, and had me at ease almost right away. Within half an hour I realized that I no longer had a death grip on the steering wheel. We covered many different driving situations and I felt at ease with all of them. I'm even looking forward to lesson #2 and driving on the freeway...< /Text>< response>

The office staff always answers the phone, and they provide clear instructions and information about each step in the process of obtaining a driver's license.

So glad we found Bill's defensive driving school.  Another local school in our area that friends referred us to didn't answer the phone all week/return our messages so we found Bill's school through Yelp.  Steve our instructor was patient, informative, and an amazing instructor.  SO impressed with the quality of instruction.  My daughter thought it was so much easier to drive than she had anticipated in large part due to the calm, and reassuring teaching from Steve.<//review>

As a senior experienced driver in my 80's I'm happy to recommend Bill's school. Though I'm an experienced driver (over 50 years) I found the DMV driver's test challenging for its rigorous emphasis on driving details one often takes for granted. My instructor, Paul, patiently pointed out crucial demands the test makes on even an experienced driver, one of which caused me to fail my first test.  I will go into the next test much better prepared because of his thoroughness! Thanks, Paul!

If I could put negative stars I would give -5 stars. Worst experience I've had with a company and the customer service representative who answers the phone, so unprofessional and doesn't understand how to apologize for bad service. Instead she gave an excuse for why it possibly happened. My very elderly instructor came to pick my son up in a Toyota Yaris...my son is almost 6 feet tall. The chair could not adjust correctly for his height. The instructor said it was fine. Then was figuring with his GPS instead of instructing my son. And still got us lost 3 times, took my soon immediately on the freeway and onto the Dumbarton bridge. My son had practiced a couple times in a parking lot. :-\ He instructed my son to make an illegal u-turn at the end of the bridge. :-! When I called to complain and request a different instructor, I was told I was being difficult. And she had no idea what kind of car her driver was instructing people in.
Like I said -5stars.</text>

Powers Plumbing did an amazing job finding an obscure part for my fixture and saving me a tremendous amount of time and money.  The plumbers sent on site were fast, courteous, and professional. They went above and beyond in keeping me informed, dealing with our building's precarious plumbing system and minimizing my stress level.

They did a fantastic job and I would highly recommend them to anyone in San Diego.<//Review>

Super reliable service! We’re having issues with water leaking from our roof and couldn’t figure out how to turn off the water for the building. I called Powers and Janet was extremely helpful. She was able to give some recommendations and had a gentlemen come out and help us with all our small requests! He was efficient and very knowledgeable during the service call. We found ourselves a new local plumbing company. Thank you again Janet!!< /review>

Lately I’ve been dealing with inefficient and lazy front desk men/women. Janet is the polar opposite-so refreshing!!!! She was efficient, fast, kind, responsive, clear, and got me a plumber in one hour. Corey came with booties on, masked, polite, and got the job done quickly and efficiently and left the space as clean as it was when he got there.

By far the best plumbing business I have been to. Very professional and extremely knowledgeable. I was working a plumbing issue with a friend and there were difficulties locating the damaged parts. Not only dis they have the parts they even had a complete replacement kit and we were able to repair both bathrooms. They are the best.<//review>

My experience with this company has been wholesome in diagnosing moisture buildup in my 3 story, shared wall, town home. These are real professionals setting the bar. David arrived on time full with information (of my leak) and started diagnosing the problem.

Perfectly efficient diagnosing! How so? Unlike "tunnel vision" from which other companies have conditioned me to, David used calculated moves ruling out and exposing all the clues before diving into best clue. This method saves total job time  and ensures accurate results.

To wrap it up, I could have literally spent my entire savings repairing my home from damages caused by my neighbors negligence.< /review>

I called this company in what was a moment of crisis due to a water leak - ultimately fortunately everything worked out to where I did not have to use their services, but I can at least say that Jason whom I spoke with over the phone in the moment was super helpful and willing to give me some useful advice free of charge. Thanks!< /Review>

<review>I had three homes with plumbing problems. Powers Plumbing sent out Donald (with over 20 yrs experience). Donald fixed all the problems. He was professional, friendly, and willing to take the time to explain what he was doing and what the problem was. Janet, the owner was very accommodating and patient over the phone. She was able to get a handle on the situation and order the parts needed BEFORE the service call.

Powers saved the day with a total re pipe of our historic home.  Bid #1 was 3 times Powers' bid.  Bid #2  (one of San Diego's largest companies) the guy leveled with us and said, "job too big for us now."   There's a lot of work out there now for plumbers.   Janet, Shane, Eric and everyone beneath them did a great job.   Eric volunteered to work on Presidents' Day to keep the job on schedule.  As landlords, we know our stuff and Powers' work and price were right on!<//text>

Horrendous customer service!  I rarely (if ever) write negative reviews.  I am a real estate agent and referred Power's Plumbing to a client to give an estimate and camera inspection.  After showing up over an hour late and expressing confusion over what they were there for and everything we already discussed on the phone, they proceeded with the estimate.  3 days later, my clients received an invoice that was $120 over what the clear agreed price was and when confronted, the employee who made the mistake first said they would make it right and fix it, then the owner, after accusing me to my client behind my back of creating problems, said they would not change the invoice.
I, of course, can't charge my client for this, so I let Power's know that if they really have this much lack of customer service, they can bill me (the referring agent) the excess fee and send a separate invoice if they want payment.  They failed to do so after that and just called a month later to pretend we never had this conversation and try to charge interest on the original invoice.

I rarely see this bad of customer service and lack of responsibility.   Not only did they lose a $9k job over it, but any future business that I have the ability to refer.  I'm surprised they can't see past that and would rather rip client's off.  Then again, I should have seen from the negative reviews in the past that this is just how they choose to operate.  Save yourself the trouble and find a different plumber.

They are basically charging me for the Hour they made ME wait for their late arrival..   Almost laughable.< /text>

I used powers plumbing today. Robert came out, he is very good at any plumbing repair,  he fixed my kitchen sink and a couple bathroom sink stoppers. Super nice guy and the owner (Janet I think) answered my call on the weekend and was very friendly. . I recommend this company. I haven't gotten a bill from them yet but they charge by the hour which I respect. I had Anderson plumbing come out for a wax seal in my toilet about a week ago and they tried charging me $475. I threw a fit, that is highway robbery. For a wax seal, it wasn't even installed correctly. The part is $3.50. What a rip off. I hope Powers will be more reasonable since their guys are paid by the hour and not commission like Anderson. Powers just seems like a good company and that's hard to come by these days!< /Text>

We had an emergency that they took care of immediately and at one third the cost that we had been quoted by a "major" San Diego plumbing company. Great technicians, superior administrators and wonderful follow up.  If you need plumbing, be it for repairs, new construction, or remodeling, I cannot recommend Powers Plumbing higher.

<Review>Powers Plumbing has completed several projects on our home and all of them done to a high standard and most very cost effectively.  They charge by the hour and work efficiently whereas many plumbers charge by the overall job regardless of how quickly they’re finished.  We have been very happy with them not only because of the good work but because if there has ever been an issue after they leave, they come back promptly and address it.  If they can fix rather than replace, that’s the first thing they try to do.  If it’s something that should have been done differently the first time, they work cheerfully and don’t charge.  In short, they act like a neighborhood business - one which understands that their long-term reputation is more important than today’s profit.  I will use them anytime - as long as the ownership and business practices stays the same.  Ive found them to be solid and trustworthy people.</Review>< pictures>

Needed a new water heater. Powers was recommended by a friend. Can't believe how much the cost of water heaters has gone up in the last 30 years, but buying it through Powers was no more expensive than getting it at Home Depot and I didn't have to lug it home. They did a nice job installing it at a reasonable labor charge. Would definitely use them again.</Text>

<text>I have used Powers Plumbing several times and have had an excellent experience each time.  They have the ability to work on older houses and do repairs on plumbing that other plumbing companies have not had the interest to work on and/or ability to work on.  I have had Powers work on a couple of heater problems in two older homes where another company was called to do the job by my property manager.  The other company could not be bothered to get the parts and wanted to replace the heater.  I told my property manager that I had called Powers Plumbing on another job and that I wanted them to be called to do the job.  Powers did the repairs and saved me from having to put in a new heater which would have cost several thousand dollars.  I usually do not do many reviews unless I think that the company is in my experience excellent.  Thank you Powers!</text></record></dataset><record>

Love supporting this local Mission Hills plumbing store.  They are no more expensive than any other, and they always give good advise about which quality companies to buy from for faucets, toilets, etc.  If you live in the area please consider using them for your plumbing needs.< /Text>

Powers Plumbing has been wonderful in responding immediately to any plumbing concerns I’ve had. With an older historic home, it’s especially comforting to know that they are up to the challenge of pinpointing a problem and fixing it, quickly and effectively.<//text>

<review>We bought an old duplex with old plumbing and heating in 1997 and have used Powers plumbing since then.  They installed new sinks and toilets in both apartments and a water heater in the upstairs unit several years ago.  This year(July, Oct. and November) they cleaned out a kitchen drain affecting the two apartments, installed a new water heater for the downstairs apartment and restored our old Coleman wall furnace in the upstairs unit.  Powers has always been responsive to our needs, knowledgeable about their work and honest in their dealings with us.< /review>< Pics>

We had to call Powers Plumbing, our neighborhood plumbing company for a leak we couldn't figure out pooling in our front yard.  Their response was immediate, and quick to determine the problem.  They had to repair a main line under our newly established landscaping which they did with minimum disruption.  This is at least our 4th great experience with Powers.  I'd highly recommend them to all.<//Text>

This is my go-to plumbing company.  They get the job done right and I never have to worry about them "finding" other problems that need pricey repairs.  Don't hesitate to call this plumbing company for honest, quality work.</Text>

Powers Plumbing has worked on a couple of jobs for me and both times were very positive experiences.  They work quickly and are fairly priced.  Janet is very good to work with.  Fernando just fixed a leak for me this past weekend and was very professional and knew how to fix the problem immediately.<//text>

Powers Plumbing really helped me out of a jam.  I had a toilet clogged and needed a plumber to come out as soon as possible.  They were timely and much more presentable than what I expected from a plumber.  Very kind, and cordial, had a great experience.</text>

Whenever we need help, broken pipe, lighting the heater when the pilot goes out, toilet broken, we call and they come running.  Plus, when we exchange our house, we know that if any plumbing issues arise they can call.  Powers will fix it and bill us.<//Review>

Oscar Covar arrived exactly as planned and was amazingly efficient, organized and tidy.
I was concerned b/c when Eric came out to price the job he had indicated it would take a helper and a master plumber to do the job in a day. I called the office when only Oscar arrived and was assured that Oscar was capable of completing the work in a day on his own, which he did, except for the arrival of Tim to help load the old toilet (a very heavy one piece unit) into the truck at the end of the day. I am very impressed with the quality of the work.  Oscar was very knowledgable and an excellent plumber. When I need a plumber in the future I will be contacting Powers.
I was also very grateful that Eric came out to provide the estimate a day after I called. He also was very knowledgable and honest about what was needed and pointing out other potential issues that could be deferred without any high pressure sales talk.</text>

<text>I brought in my Kohler toe tap bathtub drain that had stopped working.
Jason spent a significant amount of time trying to figure out what the problem might be.  He said he could order me a new one or perhaps I should contact Kohler to see if it is a warranty item.  That turned out to be a great suggestion.  Kohler sent me a video that showed me that the problem was the gasket improperly installed.
Thanks to Jason for giving the correct information to solve the problem.
When I have a tough plumbing problem my first stop is the store front at Powers Plumbing.<//text>< Resp>

<Review>Called to "fix" a faucet not properly working at my business:
Plumber comes in 1st time: a new part is needed, ok, so he orders the part.
Plumber comes a second time to "install" the part, but is not the correct one.
The plumber apparently "talks" to my staff and tells them the faucet cannot be fixed, but it works fine, my staff accepts the "explanation" and the plumber leaves.
I got a bill for $ 209 today. I called back the office and the person on the phone apologizes and says he is going to talk to the owner. Needless to say i told the office clerk that i can pay for one diagnostic visit, but that's it: my faucet is the same as it was before their visits.
I got a call back few minutes later with apologies and sorryes, which doesn't fix or solves anything by the way, then my bill now is lowered to $160. Hahahaha. I asked why don't they come and fix the issue at least, and the clerk says on the phone that the issue i have with my faucet cannot be fixed: i guess i have a faucet with a terminal plumbing disease, lol. They are gonna have to do better than this. Here is in a nutshell my experience with this business today.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1493408137151, 'text': 'Dear German,  We chose not to come back to your office and did not wish to leave you in a bad way..

The labor rate does include the travel time and we are in Mission Hills which is centrally located in Uptown. We are not as close as you thought.  I realize that you are out of the area so we discussed this with you by phone and went over our rates. Your property is in the College area, which is at minimum  20 minutes to the exit ramp - 40 minutes both directions then the time to do the job.  Here is an expose on contractors who advertise with Angies list that are not licensed.

Talk about turning negative to positive. Althought there were some scheduling issues and a minor billing adjustment to be made, the overall experience has me feeling happy. I was contacted by the owner Janet couple of times and they made it work. Both plumbers and parts guy were extremely professional, and I would recommend them again.</Review>

<Text>Great food, great service and VERY CLEAN! As a person that sees both sides of the counter, I can say that this is one of the cleanest restaurants I've been to. The food is good. Whether you are looking for a Nivea Filipino breakfast, fried chicken or a hamburger, I'd recommend Jollibee.< /Text></record>

Loved the place. We went their often since moving here two years ago. This place closed September 15, 2018 along with its neighbor Red Ribbon. No idea why they closed...the place was clean...friendly service...fast and fresh.<//text>

It's kinda strange, but really good. The chicken is crispy and the gravy is awesome! You can get noodle dishes too, which aren't bad either.< /text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>I normally do not give establishments low stars, so I decided to order some tapsilog . This location though is nice and clean with friendly service . As I start eating my tapa, the texture of the meat is weird . Nothing that I'm really used to compared to other Filipino restaurants . Then as I'm eating I notice something that really looked off. I took a picture of what I'm talking about , which you can all see. And since my stomach quickly tuck a turn , I threw away my food . I sure hope though the workers, take time to really exam what the are preparing or cooking .</text>< pics>

<review>I would love to give 10 stars if I could !
I have been coming here on and off since October 2020 and I absolutely love it. I look forward to coming here especially after a stressful day of work. This dance school is the best in the whole county .
David and his wife are absolutely lovely people and even though they have struggled to stay open through this past year, they are always very positive ,passionate, and are truly amazing at teaching all the steps .
They have a variety of classes which is great especially if you are brand new to Latin dances so you can try all the styles.
I would highly recommend giving this school a try . Environment is great and the group dances are so much fun ❤️
Thank you guys for putting together such a great school! It’s like therapy for so many of us !<//review><resp>{'time': 1618548982174, 'text': 'Thanks for the review. It makes us very happy to get such an amazing review like this.'}<//resp></record>

<text>I have been to many dance studios and dance venues throughout California. And I agree with many dance students, that this Dance studio is an impressive family of talented dance instructors. There is a solid core of dance core fundamentals that are emphasized with passion and dedication beyond the norm. This dance studio will have you dancing with full confidence in a relatively short amount of time. The husband and wife team and owners of this dance studio provide you with a tremendous amount of quality lessons. Their on going ingenuity and commitment to continuously redefine the lessons, provides you with the passion to attend each and everyday. I want to thank David and Jennifer Stein for all the encouragement throughout the Year 2019 and 2020 to challenge myself to progress to the very Best of my Ability. Your Dance Studio lives up to its name.....Majesty in Motion.
Sincerely,

Sergio Thomson

Being a beginner in any hobby can be intimidating and having two left feet definitely can add to that stress. After finding Majesty in Motion, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a 4 pack to see if I would enjoy it, and I am so grateful I did!

They are extremely welcoming to everyone, fun/relatively easy to follow, and provided a comfortable environment for us to dance in. Everyone is so kind and allowed someone such as myself, who is nervous and stiff as a board, to be comfortable in my shoes. I look forward to taking more classes!

Thank you!<//Review>

<text>Took Hip Hop Fit with Mike... it was simply amazing. The instructor does not work off of 8 counts. He simply demonstrates the move and you follow. Simple enough. I haven't followed choreography in years but this was great. Recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and intense workout. O... and be ready for some serious pushups, planks and crunches.< /text>< rate>

<text>Out of an hour long class they frequently spend 40 minutes on solo work. During this time the only instruction is watching the instructor dance in the front of the room. If you do not get what the instructor is doing you will not be corrected or have an opportunity to ask a question. The music just keeps going and you just have to try again when the instructor repeats the movement.

Then they switch to partner work. The partner work instruction is adequate in quality, but the remaining 20 minutes is insufficient to fully grasp the partner sequence.

Ultimately there is very little correction if you are doing something wrong.

This is better than some studios, but no where near as good as a studio can be. They do not deserve the 1 star rating I’m giving them, but they also do not deserve the 5 star rating they have maintained. If their overall rating was 4 stars I think that would more accurately reflect the studio.

My suggestion for improvement would be to either place the solo work in a separate class or to reduce the amount of curriculum covered in a class so that it can be done properly.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMue1ak75p6FKbtfwYwuSwuMgXP6U1j3qZ_F4Zr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

<Text>Never been to a Salsa or Bachata class before. Decided to take the beginners Salsa class they offered Monday evenings. The instructor David was the perfect mix of professional and fun to make the learning process smooth and enjoyable.
I'm coming back this Thurday to take take a second beginners class and start the Bachata one as well. Looking forward to learn more in the future.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Best Studio in San Diego! This studio has quality instructors & dedicated staff who genuinely want you to improve! They each have their own unique teaching style and adapt to each student. The studio itself is very clean and vibrant! The bright colored walls instantly put you in a good mood to dance!

They have class 7 days a week! So whether you want body movement, Salsa, or Bachata.. there is a way to fit your schedule. Not to mention the monthly rotating workshops! This is a great way to focus on details that may not be mentioned in a general class.

Keep an eye out for their Workshops with the Masters! Majesty brings in outside professional dancers so that their students have the opportunity to train with top level dancers! Overall a great studio with amazing people!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Wonderful studio and teachers. Took salsa many years ago at another studio and felt like I absorbed nothing, but I love the way the Majesty taught it and I feel like I've gotten so much more out of each class. Also tried Hip Hip Cardio and was super fun too. Parking lot is small for the small shopping center but not hard to find street parking nearby. Would definitely take classes here long-term if I wasn't moving to LA soon. Highly recommended!<//review>

I have been dancing with Majesty In Motion on and off for the last 10 years, and it has been a wonderful experience. David, Jennifer, Patrick and Eva are all excellent instructors with great personalities. No matter your dance level, you will be made to feel comfortable and supported. My dance abilities have improved greatly over the years, but I've also made some wonderful friends and had some great experiences. Majesty In Motion is like a big family, its a great company to grow as a dancer and make new friends!</review>

< Review>
David and his crew at Majesty in Motion are absolutely phenomenal!
My fiancé and I decided to try out salsa dancing on a whim last January and ended up at Tango Del Rey on a Friday evening. The first hour of the night was a class hosted by David and that was our first exposure to salsa. Needless to say, we had a great time and began taking classes at the studio soon after.

Since then, I have danced in Mexico, Peru, Boston, and NY and NONE of the classes I have taken can compare to our experience at Majesty in Motion. David and his instructors are not only great dancers themselves, but they are one with the dance. As instructors, they understand the physical and mental blocks of their students better than the students themselves and this is the defining characteristic of great teachers and the single most important quality that has allowed us to progress as well as we have with this dance company.

Joining the salsa team has positively impacted my life in ways I could have never imagined. Never having danced before in my entire life, it's an honor to be a part of a team comprised of such motivating, talented, and charismatic individuals.

To be honest, the thought of learning how to dance first terrified me. Letting the music move you is easier said than done.I was terrified that I would never be good enough. I didn’t know how to dance. I thought I would "fail". So I held on tighter, tensed up, got stiff.

David and Jennifer have taught me that the music’s always playing. We just have to decide if we’re still going to hold ourselves back, or if we’re going to dance. Try it yourself. Let go of those reigns. Give in. Surrender. Feel the music. Feel the rhythm. And then, when you’re ready, let it carry you. Let it move you.

We look forward to dancing around the world, but we'll always find ourselves back at Majesty!</Review>

Majesty and Motion helps you build an excellent foundation in dancing Salsa with it's informal yet well structured classes. You'll learn more from private lessons but the group lessons will definitely help you practice and give you an experience to let you know whether or not you'd like to pursue more Salsa. I highly recommend the group classes for beginners and their social events are great as well, the entire crew is very down to earth as well as exceptional dancers, shout out to Dave and Patrick!<//text>

I started off with the group classes and picked up a lot. I have since joined one of the beginner teams and love it even more. All of the instructors are good. No partner required, rotating is encouraged because it makes everyone a better dancer. Sometimes the classes have way too many guys or ladies, but that's not the fault of the studio. It's just how schedules line up.<//review>< pictures>

If you are interested in learning salsa or bachata, Majesty in Motion is the only studio that you need to know about. David and Jennifer are superb teachers who not only have the ability to break down any move so that anyone can understand it, classes are always lighthearted and fun as well. Classes are offered five days a week and if you are interested in taking your dancing to the next level, there are options to join numerous teams. All the great dancers who you meet at socials around the San Diego area currently train or have trained with Majesty in Motion. Do yourself a favor and check it out.< /Text>

I've spent a lot of time with David and Jennifer and the Majesty in Motion group. Aside from the fact that they're friendly, likable, and passionate, they are incredibly talented and genuinely enjoy teaching. San Diego locals are very fortunate to have these world-renowned (and they really are - they're known by every touring salsa professional) instructors in our own back yard.< /review>

<Text>Majesty in Motion is a prestigious dance company that I would highly recommend to anyone with the desire to learn and improve in salsa dancing. What sets MIM apart from other dance studios is the quality of the instruction offered. The instructors focus on the proper technique of the dance, which is the factor that ultimately takes dancers to the next level. The classes not only teach students basic moves and combinations, but also the importance that musicality and timing bring to the dance. The classes are always fun and create a welcoming and friendly environment for all. It has been great to be part of the amazing community that MIM has formed.</Text>< resp>

<Text>The best place to learn Salsa and Bachata!!!

I have danced for Majesty in Motion for the past two years and I have got to say, it has changed my life. I learned everything I know about Salsa and Bachata from David, Jennifer, Patrick, Robbie, Eva and Gonzalo. All the instructors I have encountered at Majesty have been so helpful and are wonderful human beings.

What I like about Majesty is that they focus a lot on technique, timing and body movement which are the keys to social dancing. I have looked into other dance studios in San Diego and this is hands down the best place to learn.

Majesty has become my family and they have made me feel so welcomed in the Salsa dancing community.</Text>< user_id>

I started taking classes with David Stein around November last year and was instantly hooked. I joined the company's dance team right away. He and Jennifer are fun teachers and so humble! I honestly love this company more than I can explain.. If you're in San Diego and want to learn salsa in a friendly environment Majesty In Motion (MIM) is definitely the place to go! Also, the company's newest addition, Sexy Bachata classes with Robbie!! & the Salsa kids team. MIM has got it all!<//review>

Majesty in Motion is my favorite dance studio for Salsa and Bachata in San Diego!

The instructors are very knowledgable and pay close attention to the students so that everyone understands the choreography by the end of the dance class.

Furthermore, I live far from this studio but I make an effort to drive here simply because the quality of instruction you receive here is some of the best you are going to find in SD. And on top of that, the instruction isn't rigid and uptight but relaxed and fun.

I honestly recommend this company to everyone looking to dance salsa or bachata.<//text>

I've been coming to this nail salon since the beginning of the year and they are amazing! Countless times I've walked in right before closing and they always take me for a set and pedicure which sometimes takes nearly two hours. The staff are so, so welcoming and friendly. The ladies and gentlemen take their time and pay close attention to detail. I absolutely LOVE this salon and wouldn't go anywhere else in Long Beach!</review>

<text>I came here with a friend. Mike did my nails. He did an amazing job and added crystals just like I asked. The spa is clean and doesn’t smell. The ladies are helpful. Would definitely go again. I love that my friend and I got worked on at the same time. Tip your nail tech!<//text>< rating>

I went in for a fill with a gel mood color nail . My nails were coffin when I arrived they made them square (box) The nail tech cut my nails all the way down changing my entire shape. The boss tried to refile them and they couldn't even be shaped into a narrow nail. Then to make matters worse they didn't fillable of the nails down to the cuticles.  Smh I let them finish the polish but that wasn't done rt either I had to tell them to put polish the side and edges of the nail.< /text>

<Text>Great job Mike... As usual! If there has ever been a concern of mishap, Mike and team are so quick to fix it. Mike and David do mine and my daughter's nails.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWcNGrDLXIvehurkeFUkminyoK9b13ld0UWZqE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhSSe5QOxAe5MOXcU8DTiYNRPpUZyd3k0feOdT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFxS_l_PSbc-yWH2FV4JnXR9gNJNSPi237Dygg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipON8CfYddw1uuVZ2GH7gHYf3Ao7nMXDmmNZb49v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dd33a46d0e91ef:0x894aba25e59c1118</GmapID></record>

<Text>1st and last time going there. Mike did my nails. Right after gluing the tips i told him one was crooked.  He said  oh ok ill fix it. Yet he didn't.  He kept getting up while foing my nails to help other customers that had just walked in. So he took  for ever to finish. And my nails look awful.  The way he painted my nails was awful as well because he was so in a hurry to get the next person in the chair.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>We love the staff and owner.  Always so pleasant.  We would like fresher polish, I bring my own.  My gel nails last a good two plus weeks.

Love this place have been going there since they opened, very clean and everyone is so nice. And my gel nails last and don't chip. If there is a smudge they have no problem fixing it. Love the pedicures very relaxing.</Text>

Clean. Nice staff. Great pedicure. Terrible job on my gel manicure. She did that obligatory "I'm going to touch each nail with this tool" thing, used NO cuticle softener or oil before hacking away at them, then when she got paint on my skin and let it dry in the light, tried to pick it off with the cuticle cutter, cutting into my skin. Paint is bumpy and uneven. Love the color matching gel and regular, but not enough to come back or recommend.< /text>

Super nice location, right off the freeway, friendly staff. Great price! $99.99 for my first set of lashes. Love the products that they have to maintain the lashes! And the masks are so cute!!

Aracely was great, had a ton of questions and it was great to be able to get all the nerves out before the service. Saga and Brittany are both very good and I'd go back to them anytime. Totally worth every penny!<//text>

*NOTE* They said below they would refund me for my November charge... Check my bank statement... they didn't. They refunded it, and then charged it again...then 4 days later refunded me HALF!? Guys I signed a cancellation form in January of 2020- was charged in April (even though they were closed due to covid) and was DOUBLE charge in November...make that make sense. Haven't been all year. I am immune compromised, and wouldn't risk covid for my eyelashes. You can tell the company is struggling to continue to charge customers who haven't been in and canceled 10 months ago. I have been calling for over a week - prior to writing this review to give benefit of the doubt. Don't go here, and if you do, DO NOT put a credit card on file. I'm being charged OVER A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER I CANCELED!!!!!< /Text>

I was Visiting Los Angeles and this place was so close and convenient to my hotel . I happened to call and get the appointment the same day . Staff was super nice to squeeze me in for service before my big meeting. I used curb side check in and I got a text when my stylist was ready to be seen. Very clean and sanitized studio . Social distance was maintained by everyone and I felt very comfortable. My last artist was so awesome . Loved how my lashes turned out . I am getting lot of compliments. I will surely visit whenever I am in the area.< /review>

<text>I'm really disappointed and honestly disgusted at how Amazing Lash Studios treats their clients during a Global Pandemic.

I was told I needed to sign a freeze form in January to suspend services on my account, while I was going to be traveling in and out over the course of the next few months. So I did. I signed in with the added detail to reach out to me to confirm PRIOR to charging my account for services again.

I was charged in April and May... Without any consent or communication prior- all while our county is in a mandated quarantine, mind you. I called to dispute and discuss - come to find out they're closed! Are you kidding?

Then I wasn't charged for 5 months...and then I check my account, and I'm charged again in NOVEMBER!? Again no prior consent was given.

I'd like to give the benefit of the doubt, so I called and thankfully someone was there to review. She said she needed me to send in the form from January again...so I did. Once she reviewed she said she'll have a manager call back as she didn't have the authority to refund. (Mind you this is now for over $600 in services fees throughout the year - when I haven't been since January). I never got a call back from a manager. I've called two more times - nothing.

Unprofessional, unethical, and frankly unacceptable. I will update this review if anything changes, but I'd say it's only fair for me to share an honest review for anyone considering going in for the holidays - stay far away! They will pull any ploy to get a card on file, and then continue to charge you.

I feel bad for the technicians, because this isn't a reflection on them - but the management.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1606932486445, 'text': 'Danny ,\n\nWe apologize for your inconvenience.\n\nYou are more than welcome to come use the credits which don’t expire for 6 months .

I researched a lot via various channels before i booked appt with them due to the current pandemic situation for social distancing and sanitization and safety process . honesty i wanted to be just careful and safe before i visit any personal care studios. i am just being honest , i was amazed to see that this location is very beautiful, clean and sanitized. They made very beautiful and cozy individual rooms for each client they service.  i believe the owner was at the front desk and she was sweet and very professional. she took my temperature, asked covid safety questions and provided all the details about what they offer and their membership.

my stylist was kind, attentive and did a great job on my lashes knowing the fact that i had initially gotten it done somewhere else and just got the refill done here. i am getting lot of compliments and i am really happy. price was affordable ...and i was referred by a friend aswell so got some points for that with their referral program.

I saw their reviews on google and yelp and i say i truly recommend anyone who wants to be safe at the same time take care of themselves by upkeeping their lashes . I will surely stick to this salon for my lashes:)< /Text>

<Review>I travel a lot here and have gone to a few lash artists in Los Angeles area and hands down this studio is the best. All the front desk staff is very personable and makes you feel comfortable right off the bat. They asks you up what kind of look you are aiming for and go over their amazing styles, and makes sure you are happy with your lashes. I always get many compliments after getting my lashes here. with my crazy schedule, I go to any available artist and come out happy after each visit. When I was going to other studios, I would have to get my lashes filled every two weeks, but the extensions I had put on at amazing lash MDR would last me atleast three weeks. I have recommended them to my other girl friends, and stand by those recommendations! I'm looking forward to my next appointment with them when i visit back here:)< /Review><Name>Katherine baker< /Name><date>1595102155315< /date>< gmap_id>

<review>Marisol is an incredible stylist! I love this salon. My lashes are always so glam. I get them filled every two weeks but often times they look fresh still after two weeks! I couldn’t go without my lash extensions and Marisol does an amazing job. Everyone at the salon is very friendly and helpful! Do yourself a favor and cut your daily routine in half. Get your lashes done!< /review></record></dataset><record>

I was so unsure and nervous about trying eyelash extensions..however I got them done and I must say very pleasant experience and I love my lashes. I get lot of compliments and it looks amazing like I never want to take them off. Everyone was really nice and welcoming. they went through the pictures and styles with me. nice and clean studio and I had my own room to be serviced in . love that part . My stylist was very knowledgeable and she explained me the after care very well. my lashes looks so great after 2 weeks . Wonderful experience overall!</Review>

My lash technician is Brittany J and she is great. I have gone to her twice and my style lash of choice is always lovely. She is sweet and gentle on my lashes. The application is efficient and quick. My lashes did fall off of one eye within 2.5 weeks, but I personally prefer that over lashes that stick around for months on months like at previous experiences (these ones are light and don't rip out my lashes). This last experience, on lash was glued on a bottom lash; however, I didn't realize until I got home. I'm positive if I would've caught this at the salon, she would've removed it for me no problem. As of now, I am a loyal customer and will continue to go to Brittany J.</Review>

<text>Britney is an amazing stylist! She’s meticulous but fast and her lashes LAST. Getting eyelash extensions has been the biggest improvement to my routine and I regret not getting them sooner. This studio is cheaper than wearing strip lashes every day and much easier. Most days I don’t even wear makeup anymore because the lashes give me a ready to go out look! My skin has also improved because I wear less makeup. Everyone at the studio is very kind and can often times accommodate last minute appointments. Do yourself a favor and glam yourself up!</text>< pictures>

<Review>My lash tech did a great job! Everyone was very polite and helpful. My only complaint would be that she was running thirty minutes late and there was no reparation for the long delay. They have a no show policy, where they will charge you the full amount, but no policy when your lash tech is running behind more than 10 mins. This was my first time here as well.</Review>< Rating>

Yolva is amazing! Not only her work, but also her personality! Would recommend her to anyone who is looking for lashes. She listens to your style preference and gives you exactly that and more!!

<Review>I recently started getting my lashes done here. The service has been fantastic! Tabby is the absolute best!! The customer service is friendly and professional. Everyone that works the front desk is friendly and inviting. You are greeted warmly from the moment you enter. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing. Tabby is such a fantastic technician and a lovely person too. I have been very pleased with the overall service and I also signed up for their membership. It's the best deal in my opinion. I definitely recommend this location.< /Review>< Rating>

<review>I had a fantastic experience at Amazing Lash Studio! I was in need of a new place to go because I have moved away from Hollywood... and I am so happy I have ended up coming here! It's very clean and welcoming inside, I enjoyed the way it was decorated. My lash technician made sure I understood what kind of lashes I wanted and was going to get! It didn't take too long but the results were fantastic. It's been a few weeks and I am finally heading back in tomorrow for my fill!

Definitely recommend this place to anybody!  I have lots of experience with getting lashes and I am very pleased with the results I had!

Thank you!< /review>< pics>

I absolutely LOVE this place. It was a blessing stumbling upon this place as I was having trouble finding someone that knew exactly what kind of style I wanted for my lashes.
Shu was so patient and did magic on my eyes, considering I have such small lashes naturally. She is quite the perfectionist, which is what you need when it comes to lash extensions.
Her and the team overall are so great, including the receptionist, they all seem to love what they do and are all passionate about their work. I will always come here from now on because I know they do it right! Thanks again!!</Review>

<text>Bellan was an absolute doll! Her warm welcome was a delight! My lashes look amazing.

The next day one of my lids were a little sore and Miss Shana was very kind, sympathetic
and remedied the problem instantly.
This by no means is a deterrent from returning.<//text>< name>

Love this studio ! So glad it’s in my neighborhood:) I've been to other lash studios and did experience my lashes falling out tremendously after a few days. however . It has been three weeks for my lash refill and I still have lashes in place. I go about 3-4 weeks for my fill . The products I bought really helps with my retention!! my stylist was skilled and professional. Like how pretty the studio is and they are very accommodating with appointments. They always work with my crazy schedule. The studio manager ended up doing my refill once since they were pretty packed and I had to go out of town so had that urgency . Front desk is super amazing !

At first , I was skeptical to try this place after reading some reviews but I must say What has been described do not meet the standards of how this studio is run.. at-least I can say that from my great experience. I honestly believe it’s from either their competitors or someone who just wants free stuff .. sorry !! I just had to wait few mins at my last appt due to stylist running behind but hey I don’t mind as long as their work is great ! Been here since August and I have tried numerous different stylists and they all are very skilled and does a great job. I get lot of compliments on my lashes .<//text>

If i could give them a zero star, I would. I sign up for the membership November 2018; after 13 days came back December 2018 for retouching. Asked the staff to freeze my account, because I will be overseas the next few months; and they said they will freeze it for 3 months. But since I am wearing glasses/contacts; my eyes got irritated and my doctor told me not to get those lashes anymore. April 2019 comes; they charged my account since the freeze for 3 months is done already. I was not able to contact them at that month since I don’t usually check my trqnsactions. May 2019 comes; they charge my account again. So I called the place to let them know that If it’s okay to cancel the membership since my eyes got irritated. The receptionist said okay she’ll go ahead and cancel my membership. June 2019 comes, they charged my account again; so I called again and said the same thing. The receptionist said I need to go there and sign a cancellation form. And I let the receptionist know that when I called the previous month, they can go ahead and process it through phone. In which apparently, it was not cancelled since I need to sign a certain form to cancel my membership. And so the next day I went there and sign the form to formally cancel my membership. July 2019 comes they charged my account again; so I called them why my card is being charged. And I was informed that they never received the cancellation form that I signed the previous month. The receptionist who I gave the cancellation form did not give it to the manager. The next day, I went ahead and sign AGAIN the form to CANCEL my membership. BUT November 2019 comes; they charged me again. I called to let them know that I signed for CANCELLATION but I guess they just freeze my account since it’s just 3 months again that they did not charge me. I did not have time to go there again and sign the form. I just came back from my overseas trip; and when i checked my account; I was really charged again by this company from November to January 2020. Maybe if I will let the other customers know what’s going on with my account; then hopefully they won’t need me to sign a cancellation form over and over again. I’m planning to go maybe next week if time premits to sign the form AGAIN. And hopefully; they will give me refund for ALL of these, if not maybe some. because I don’t need any lashes credits...They’ve been charging my card since 2019 & 2020 even the last time that they touch my lashes was 2018.

So don’t sign up in your first trial. Wait until how your eye reacts with those lashes until then; don’t be tempted with their flowery words on signing up for their membership.<//Text>

Got my lashes there recently and it was a very pleasant experience. Firstly I loved the friendly staff, and then the ambiance during the entire process was very relaxing. I almost fell asleep. They explained all the choices, helped me pick the right size as i didn’t want to go too big, and made the entire process very easy. I picked the gorgeous style and it is absolutely amazing. I really love it.Now I have no problem skipping eye makeup altogether. It’s been 2 weeks, the lashes are still same and my eyes are as bright as ever been. Thank you so much for the wonderful service. I can’t wait to go back for my fill 😊<//Text>

<Text>I have been getting lash extensions for years now ..i got the experience of going to Amazing lash studio and got weightless beautiful set of volume lashes. i had picked up the flyer for $89.99 for fullset of lashes at the local restaurant which i thought was a great deal . Staff was great and my stylist was super sweet. i waited to put this review up since i really liked my lashes after the service however, i wasn't sure if it there were going to last.however, i think i can wait another week or more to get fill so i am really happy about that! i didn't get the membership they offered me however now i feel its totally worth it.</Text>< rating>

<Text>I got my lashes done here and became a member. however, i waited to give review to see how they would hold. I am super happy and i love the way my eyelashes are done here! i've been to a couple of other places and i love the fact that my lashes look full every time i come here; Lashes are very lightweight, soft and don't even feel like i have extensions on. went of vacation and was scared of loosing lashes however they lasted pretty long. I always get lot of compliments. My lashes last up to almost 3 weeks..tried 3 different stylists there. Everyone is always super friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend.< /Text></record>

<rating>2< /rating><text>The management of this establishment is poorly run. They do not honor your appointments made with certain staff members, and last minute place you with a different lash stylist.

In addition, I cancelled my membership 6 months ago and was randomly charged last month and this month for the membership fee. I attempted to call the studio and was told last month (and this month) that I would receive a phone call from the manager or owner regarding getting refunded. After several attempts, I was not offered a refund for these fraudulent charges. I had to go to my credit card company for refund. This place needs to be reported. Ridiculously horrible customer service.

On the bright side, two stars were given for lashes and cleanliness of studio.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I normally don't write any reviews however, i felt the need to put my honest opinion out there for this place. I was skeptical about making the appt at first however, i decided to make an appointment, and by far it was the best decision ever. The place is nice and clean. Front desk was super nice and very knowledgeable. My stylist did such an awesome job, my 6D lashes look amazing.  I highly recommend amazing lash. Ladies, you won't be disappointed..This place is nothing like what you read in the reviews.. i feel people will always look to blame on others if either they they don't take care of lashes and they experience lash fallout or if they want free stuff. IT IS VERY SIMPLE!! This studio is clean, legit and I will definitely go back for a refill. I am not a member yet, but I will consider it.</text>

<Text>This New place is Awesome! I was super nervous since i was getting my lashes done for the first time but my stylist made the entire process very painless and easy. can't wait to go back for my fill:)

I usually don't write any reviews but i saw some bad reviews which doesn't seem relevant to this studio because i didn't see any drama with Scheduling so thought if my review will give any kinda clarity. i didn't thought they were very aggressive with selling me membership or products. They explained me the benefits of getting the membership and also how the aftercare product will help maintain the longevity of my lashes. Appointment booking was easy, i made it online and i was able to go in the next day. Front desk was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place.</Text>< Pictures>

They absolutely deserve a 5 star rating. I’ve been a customer for few months now and I haven’t had a single complaint. I highly recommend Nicole, Portia & Saga. I see some new stylists and I am sure they all are great ! Oh my god , so glad they changed their entire front desk team :) I went there few days ago and owner was at the front ..  She is super sweet and always talking to clients .The facility is extremely clean and the lashes themselves are well worth it, I’m getting compliments all the time on how natural they look. I drive half an hour to get my lashes done because they truly are the best around. Totally recommend this place !!!<//text>

This was my first time getting extensions and I was comfortable during the 2 hour service. They provided a round cushion to go underneath my knees as well as a blanket, which kept me warm in the AC. My stylist Amy is very skilled at applying lashes. She was careful and gentle and answered all my questions. It's a beautiful, comfortable space! Lots of free parking! Have a wonderful Grand Opening this weekend!</Text>

<Review>The customer service manager, Cat, was very nice and very informative. She even offered me $10 credit every time I refer new client's. The place is very clean and very private. It's one client per one room. Love this place I'll be referring all my friends, I'll convince them to drop their current eyelash place they go to.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

6th time getting lashes and first time was not bad - had to deal w the whole up sale and join as a member, which made little sense since I was unsure how the lashes were going to hold up!  Second time, that was kind is ok, third time most painful terrible experience all the lashes turned and got tangled beyond... not pleasant!  Then had two great experiences with the lash teacher - but, then I made the mistake of taking a time slot over a good technician - here I am 7 days out from my fill more than 60% of the lashes have fallen off, in the sink, shower, pillow case and my all time fave in my eyeball!  I have had lashes for 8 years and I have to say this is beyond ridiculous!!!  I say try somewhere else this is not even close to a good deal or good quality.< /Review>

<Review>They absolutely deserve a 5 star rating. I was hesitant to go after reading some reviews , honestly speaking I feel they are from x employees or competitors . I had a very pleasant experience visiting marina del Rey location. The facility is extremely clean, the staff is super sweet, and the lashes themselves are well worth it, I’m getting compliments on how gorgeous they look . Totally worth visiting this studio . I surely will come see you all when I visit next time :)<//Review>< rating>

First time I was at your place the girl was very nice but missed significant lashes and I left not too happy because I didn’t feel like I got what I paid for.. came back for a 30 min touch up a week later and someone else filled in the ones she missed. I was very happy that they were able to work with me. Would def come back.< /Text>

Worst salon I've ever been to. Staff was friendly but the salon's system is the worst and slow. They only used 1,5 hrs time to fill up only 50% of my own lashes expecting me to be happy. Luckily I spent 5hrs there untill all my lashes were filled. Never going back there.< /Review>

{'time': 1564784325367, 'text': 'Kristina,\n\nI apologize that you feel that we have wasted your time. Although, on two different days, two different appointments and with foreign lashes that you had on we accommodated you to the best of our ability, by giving you 2 removals (with glue still on your lashes from Thailand) and a Full set of lashes with two different stylists. You also spoke with 3 of our front desk lash consultants, 2 stylists and the owner (Hamida), yet you were still not satisfied with 5 hours and 4 services and only paying $103.00. I personally spoke with you on your first visit and explained to you that it was not your nor our fault and that I was trying to work with you on a solution, you seemed to understand. Although the next day, I was not there for the appointment, we ended up giving you 2 more services. I am not sure what more we could have done for you personally being that the glue was foreign. It could have been a liability or a worst situation if you would have had a horrible reaction with what was left on your lashes and skin that we could not remove after two removals. I wish that we could have done more for you, and I feel like I have personally communicated and accommodated you to the best of my ability without causing you any harm or time wasted. Again, I apologize that you feel the way you do about your experience with us. If there is anything else I could help you with please feel free to contact us here at the studio. Thank you for you time and feedback.\n\nBest,\nAlyssa Kolligian & ALS Staff.'}<//response>

Very disappointing experience. Not sure of this saloon is even legit. They kept chasing me for days to give my credit card number to reserve my appointment. After I gave them my card details and my appointment was confirmed. I receive a call 20 minutes prior to my appointment that they cant take my appointment, their busy and no technician is available.</review>

<Text>This place is garbage! My friend used to work here and let me tell you this is the most unorganized business ever! What she told me i think i had to share because it is ridiculous. First of all the owners are too cheap to hire a professional cleaning staff so if you think you are in a sanitary place, you’re not! If your a member I hope you know your membership is only worth 50 dollars which is why if you want to use two credits towards a full set you still have to pay 34 dollars. If there’s a no call no show and their trying to charge a client for not showing up but don’t have a card on file they go to the extremes of calling the credit card machine company to get your credit card number that you may have used on a product you bought so they can charge them which to me seems illegal. This needs to be heard, needs to be shared.</Text></record>

<text>AMAZING!!! It was my first time few days ago and I walked out with a membership that i can come back every 3 weeks confidently feeling that I've finally found my "lash place". Amazing Lash studio's introductory special of $89.99 and the convenient location was what drew me to this place to begin with. honestly, i was truly surprised by the level of experience and professionalism I received by my lash stylist . The reason i say this because i feel the reviews doesn't relate to the service i received. I couldn't believe how fast my stylist did my full natural set. I walked in and out within an hour and half..filled out paperwork at the beginning..they gave me foaming cleanser to wash my lashes.  I didn't feel rushed at all.  my lashes look so good and is exactly what I wanted.

I've had lashes done in the past and sometimes it would take more than 2 hours, initial set was around 3 hours at one of the other lash place i went. each employees/front desk I encounter was friendly and knowledgeable. They were not pushy at all to sell their membership or their products. The studio is clean, modern and well-designed. If you live or work in close to Marina del rey/santa monica/venice/culver/west LA this too could be your "lash place". i would highly recommend.< /text>< pics>

<Review>HORRIBLE SERVICE! I went for a lash removal and a full set and the lady who did my removal did excellent, however it doesn't even look like I have lashes on! And they charged me an upgrade service for volume lashes and I still can't tell I have on lashes.   They also charged my card twice. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.< /Review>< Pics>

I have been waiting for a call back for over 3 weeks already from the manager! I went it for lash extentions since they were asking for models. Everything was good at first finished my free treatment I bought a product and did a follow up appointment the following month but the day after I got the treatment my eyes got very red and got an allergy reaction.  No blame to anybody since I didn't know I was allergic I called that I wanted to cancel my next appointment and I wanted a refund of the product that i bought. I was told to go within that week so I wouldnt get charged any cancellation fee since I was doing the cancellation 30 days ahead of my appointment.  I went in signed the cancellation papers and they said they would process the refund for the product withing 7-10 business days. A week passed and didnt get a refund I called back and the manager said she would check it out and called me back. The person who had process the refund didn't finish processing it so the manager did finish it I got my refund. To that point great! Until recently my bank account got charged twice by them!!!! I called and they said that i had just filled the cancellation few days ago when I did it 30 days before my appointment. Now they dont want to refund my money that they charged twice!instead they said to go in for a free treatment which I had paid for it already.  First of all how am I going to get a treatment when I'm allergic to it. Secondly, their dates dont match up. Third, how are they saying i had cancelled few days prior my appointment when I had gone 30 days before my appointment. Its not my fault the papers weren't filled and cancelled when I went in and signed. I just want my money back!!!!! I demand to speak to the manager and they didnt want to let me speak to her.<//text>

< review>
Poor lash work. Eyes were half full after 2 hour session. They offered a correction at the time of the appt for three days later because they agreed they were not up to standard. When I showed up for the second appt, they said it'd be 20 minutes only, of which would not fulfill the lack of work from first appt. Instead they refunded. The girl who did my lashes only has a month experience, she told me this. She's still learning, I get it, its not fair for her or myself though. On their day of opening they should have had their best lashers on the front line instead of the girl who is still learning. Also during the first session I was asking some questions of which she gave one word answers to, then I realized she didn't want to talk because she was listening to music on her earphones (I could hear the music). She tuned out  of her client into her own world, what a joke. Definitely training is lacking here. This is my  first bad review, I am sorry to have to do this but you all need to know.<//review>

Dr Ruben and his assistant Cynthia are the best. My kid gets really anxious with any dr. Treatment he needs. Dr Ruben was really patient and understanding of my kid. Did the treatment my kid needed and didn't even notice. 100% recommended 👌</text>

I absolutely love this dentist. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming. The dentist themselves are very gentle with the children and very one-on-one with each child they greet them and have conversations with them which makes it easier on the child. I recommend this dentist any parent who has a child who is scared of the dentist.<//text>

bad experience, my daughter had an appointment with the anesthesiologist yesterday at the corona location, the only issue was that I waited over an hour. Well when we got home she started getting a fever and pain and it wouldn't go away and gave her Tylenol. Today the fever hasn't gone away and I asked for a prescription and they can't even give me a prescription for fever or pain? What kind of children's dentist is this seriously. I don't recommend anyone coming here they don't care about the kids here< /text>

I absolutely love the staff here, and so do my kids!! My daughter has been going here for 5 years and has never had a bad experience. She has unfortunately had to have quite a bit of work done, but they have always made her feel comfortable. My son also sees this office for both regular dentist visits along with orthodontist. He also likes the staff here. Thank you guys for making my kids feel safe and comfortable. Definitely makes it easier knowing you have my kids best interest!!</review>

<review>I had the WORST experience here today. The Dentist does not work well with children. He lacks gentleness and patience. My 5 yr old went in to get her cavaties filled. She was terrified. Instead of talking to her and telling her whats going to happen. He rips her from my arms and puts her on the seat. Then he calls for help and the assistants hold
Down my daughter. The dentist then grabs my daughters face out of frustration and holds it very firm. He places the mask on and closes her lips with his fingers. And completely covers her mouth! My daughter was terrified. I finally say.. Its not working she looked like she was going to pass out.and i don't think she can breathe. Hes says if u are uncomfortable I can stop. I say get your hands off my daughter. This is enough!!! He was rude and unprofessional. And should NOT WORK WITH CHILDREN!! When I told the manager what happened she would not acknowledge what happened and told me that if I wanted to i could take her somewhere else. Handed me her paperwork and that was it! We are both traumatized.I cannot believe how rough he was with my little girl. I would never recommend this place!!!! Ever!!<//review></record>

I wouldn't recommend this place to people that don't have money laying around. I took my child there because he was having an issue with his teeth, they saw him and did the exam. Later in the visit they said that they require a $50 deposit to ensure he returns to get the services that he needs ( THAT INSURANCE COVERS 100%)</text>

I had an appointment. I arrived 30 mins before my appointment. The lady at check in asked my child name. I gave it to her. She gave me the new patient paperwork. I waited almost 3 hours to be told there was a miss communication with the staff and that they were not able to take me in because the doctor left and to reschedule for another day. If there was an option for zero star I would put. Worst customer service ever!<//Text>

I took my daughter here years ago and he literally tortured her with a needle. She was only five or six years old and it was a little traumatic for her. He was such a rude and mean nasty person that even the receptionist was sheepish and I could tell wanted to apologize. I ended up taking her to my dentist in Santa Ana that I've had since I was a kid and she did not cry or make a fuss one single time. Do not go here they are the worst<//review>

Not doing it rite.  I highly recomend this place for your children. 👍👍👍👍👍 thank you for evrything...</review>< pics>

<Text>Yes, I USE to go to Dentistry 4 Kids. At first I didn't mind it. But the wait time is ridiculous. One to two hours, sometimes more. My kids would see a different dentist every visit. Personnel lack customer service. I do have to admit, that inside for kids is cool, dinosaur decor, kids movies to watch and video games for the kids to play while they wait their turn. But yes, they will keep asking you to make another appointment for something very simple, just to get more money out of the insurance company. I found a new dentist off of Indio, (whom they recommended only because they didn't provide a particular procedure, in which my daughter didn't need.) I go there now and will never look back at Dentistry 4 Kids.<//Text>< Pics>

I took my 5 year old grandaughter with a tooth ache...I was very pleased with the friendly staff and the doctor...my grandaughter felt no pain during treatment..they used laughing gas I decided to take my other grandchildren and was very pleased...but what made me write this review is when they treated my daughter whom was super nervous at other places..she was given something to calm her down a long with  laughing gas and anesthetic..she did great...(by the way, I have 18 years experience in the dental field, so I knew exactly each procedure and was very pleased with materials used)<//Text>

The only thing that I don't like it is that when you come every six months for routine cleaning if you have like two or 3 kids you have to wait for the same dental assistant because they are from the same family, they have two dental assistants but you have to wait for the same person because we are from the same family no matter what if the dental assistant is lazy or impolite anyway you have to wait until she done with all members of your family.<//Review>

Awful Awful experience.  Starting from the moment you walk in it's just awful staff give you attitude the dentist are very rude on the braces side. I had a question for him and he answered me by say "yo what's up"? I said excuse me he then apologize. So unprofessional everything is disorganized the wait is 3 hours or more. Iam so glad I switched to a 5 start dentist everyone is so polite and very welcoming !<//text>

Great dentists they know what they're doing kids love the place it has a play area but of course if your child has cavities they're maybe not so happy afterwards which is normal but doctors handle every kid with care and professionally.< /review>

Horrible experience, except for the dentist. They over book their appointments. Every time I've gone, I had to wait at least an hour to see the dentist. The front office girls lack customer service skills and the "manager" has no idea what she is doing. She couldn't even explain the billing process. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.< /review>

By the way that's how they get to charge your insurance for two visits.  Second visit waited for an hour. This time, I spoke up. Yes I was that rude customer.  You have to be with these people.

DO NOT GO HERE!! seriously take your child and run as fast as you can in the other direction. This dentist put unnecessary steel crowns on all 4 of my two year olds front teeth. Then to make matters worse he did such a terrible job that he had to get two of them removed because of infection and failure to remove all debris, This guy is  a quack and just wants your money. the ladies that work the front desk convey enough warmth to make a snowman shiver. Now my poor kid is terrified of dentists AND dinosaurs. Thanks dentistry for kids. you ruined my childs teeth for the next 3 years.<//Text>

I was recommended by a family member to take my son here because they had a great experience.... My son had two of his permanent teeth growing begind his baby teeth that weren't even loose so they had to pull 4 of his baby teeth so they can grow right.... They gave my son laughing gas and started pulling his teeth.... My baby was screaming and crying and didnt give him no antibiotics or anything..... Never bringin him back here again<//review>

Unless you got alot of time to waste. Don't go here.  I've been taking my son here for many years. The dentist is great. Time management/scheduling from the office staff is a joke. My son had an 8:00 a.m. appt.  and I was told he would be the first one. I specifically asked the lady 6 months ago. That I wanted the early appt., because my son being special needs-I can't have him sitting around for 6 hours.  So when I signed in I noticed 2 other 8:00 a.m. appts.  Before me, that was fine. They took the first 8:00 at 8:30 then there was a sister, (I told her by the time my son they get to my son it would be 9:30) I told them that I was leaving, and I wasn't interested in coming back. And question what was up with mounting people on  top of each for appts.  I noticed on some of the comments people were complaining about that also.  I told her I have an 8:00 appt.  by the time you get to my son it will be 9:30 and it will be afternoon when we get out of there. I wasn't planning on spending my whole day there. I wouldn't recommend this place.<//review>

<Text>I'm not sure why finding a good children's dentist it's so hard to find, this place over books their patients and make us wait to get x-rays over an hour then another hour waiting to see the actual dentist just to tell me that my chikd needs to come back another day just for two fillings so that means I have to wait for another three hour on a different day! I have to give up my whole morning or afternoon just to take my child to the dentist it makes no sense, I've complained to the office but they don't seem to care, never coming back here.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcb0c7d8f5e12f:0x342d469affa06709< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

In both cases I found the service level to be exceptional. I was greeted almost immediately upon arrival and the people there were extremely friendly and courteous. All repairs were completed on time and as promised and I felt they went above and beyond my expectations to make my visit as easy and comfortable as possible.< /Text>< pics>

I was impressed by the care the service rep, David, gave to me.  He went out of his way to get the insurance info needed, and in addition, made copies of the policy statement for me.

When I returned the loaner car, he called me by name. Very impressive.  I'd give him 10 stars.<//text>

I’ve been bringing my cars to Audi for service for many years and am always met with courtesy and professionalism. Jose Magana has also been my service advisor for many years, in several different locations. He is consistently friendly, polite, conscientious and thorough in explaining service needs. Any time I have questions, no matter how obvious or mundane, he takes the time to make sure I understand what the maintenance issue involves.
I appreciate the attention to detail and quality of service. Thank you.< /Text>

David Derebenskiy was very friendly and professional being that it was my first time at FJ Audi Service. Kept me well informed on what they were doing to my S7 and timely status texts. I highly recommend David as an advisor.
I’m a bit disappointed at the complementary car wash service FJ provides. I expected a much better wash then just a hose down and an air dry which left all bird droppings still on the hood.
FJ should reassess how they wash a customer’s car.
This has nothing to do with how the rest of my experience was with David.
David keep up the great work!</review>

<Review>It was easy to make an appointment that fit my schedule, and they provided me a loaner, which was really helpful.  I had a recall and regular service, and both were done quickly.  They also needed to change the satellite software on the NAV system because the Google Earth license had expired..  It is not available for all models, and they discovered through their research that they could update my car. They provided me with periodic updates, and they were able to complete the service in a very timely manner.  I would go back for service because it was very easy and convenient.< /Review>< Rate>

My go to place for my vehicle maintenance needs. I drive 70 miles (there are dealerships near me as well) to visit them and that should explain how good they are. Jose Magana is always courteous, takes the time to explain the issue, discusses the remedy and once the work is done he goes over the bill to explain the charges. No push selling. He gives me the choices, answers my questions and lets me take the decision. Jose goes above and beyond  every time. Drop off and pickup scheduling is super easy as well. Amenities are comprehensive and always clean. That's what I expect from a premium dealership and constantly receive it.<//text>

<Text>I really like how they provide Uber pick-up and drop-off for free of charge. I really like how the payment process was easy and quick and how they're flexible to rescheduling last minute and lots of things can be done over the phone/ app. Great service. My car needed the break rotor change and right away the change upgrade the driving experience significantly. Pricing certainly is higher than other places but I think the service and convenience made the trip worth it.< /Text><Name>An Bui<//Name>< Response>

We love Audi Fletcher Jones. Our service advisor, Henry always goes the extra mile, is very knowledgeable and also is able to give us helpful advise. From the moment you drive up , they are so quick and efficient , I can be out of there in 10-15 minutes, if necessary and that includes hoping into a loaner.

I reside in Northern California and I needed to have my Audi 8 serviced. I was directed to Service Advisor, Paul Panya, who kept me well informed throughout the service process. Even though I may never need to return to Audi Fletcher Jones as I go to a dealer in my area, I highly recommend them for their professionalism and quality work performed.<//review>

Henry of the service department was fantastic. I had an issue with my brakes, and they weren’t able to replicate the issue at first, however, he continued to look for the problem. When the problem was identified, the brakes were fixed. My rental vehicle was dropped off at my house and my car picked up, and when my vehicle was done, the car was brought back to my house. Exceptional service, especially during Covid.<//Text>

We brought in our car to service and although it wasn't an Audi, the service team, including Frank, really took care of us. He explain the process to us and made sure we knew how long (most likely) the process would take. I wish he updated us on the time later, but it's no problem. When we asked him later, he updated us with the time expected and it was pretty spot on. I also want to mention that I left my new phone box in the car and no one took it. It was my mistake and I should have taken all of my belongings out but I forgot that one box in the passenger footwell. Frank and his team made sure that it was safe and that everything was left where it belonged. So my family is really grateful for their work and fixing our car. They're a good honest team and I couldn't ask for more.</text>

Thank you Dan for responding quickly to my concern on the scuff mark I noticed after I picked my car up for service. You were able to advise me right away that photos were taken and the scuff mark was originally there when I dropped off my vehicle. You were very accommodating and I appreciate you allowing me to have the scuff removed the following day. I only wish Henry would have advised me of any markings on my car when he took pictures as I was unaware of it and naturally assumed the incident happened there. I think it’s a nice courtesy to inform your customers when you see any damage or markings on their cars because like myself I was unaware. Thank you again for your great customer service.</text>

Dealing with Samantha at Fletcher Audi Service was the best service advisor experience I've ever had.

I switched from BMW to Audi one year ago and will never go back. My first service experience was super easy. I arrived for my appointment, was quickly given a loaner so I didn't have to wait and got my car back quickly the following morning. I love Audi FJ!< /review>

<Review>I bought a used car from here. They swore up and down that the car was fine and showed me the car fax. Let me tell you the car fax isn't a strong enough proof because after driving it a few months and it turned off on me. I took it to the mechanic and they said this car had already had issues in the past with the engine and they opened up the engine to show me all the parts which where not the original parts for that car added in by past repairs. There was tiny metal chipped and it was floating in all the fluids so the mechanic said the engine is no longer good, so I had to purchase a new engine for the car. It is very funny to me that the sales people at Audi are quick to try to sale you a car but as soon as there is an issue no one from there wants to be the one having to talk to you for selling you a lemon. I am dead set about my experience here, I don't care what there response back will be. I hope this sheds light on how sketchy some dealers and sales people can be.</Review>< Time>

I have been taking my Audi S8 to Audi Fletcher Jones for the past year for all my servicing needs.  I couldn't be more happy with how I have been treated by the whole team.  The staff are friendly, attentive, and willing to help in anyway they can to insure my service experience is nothing short of perfection.  One person I would like to point out specifically is Frank Camargo.  Frank has always gone the extra mile for me and I didn't want his efforts to go unnoticed.  Thanks again to Frank and all the staff at Audi Fletcher Jones for all your hard work.  Keep up the good work!</text>

The Tech Advisor, Frank Camargo was excellent. My only complaint was that when I got into my car after service, someone had adjusted the seating of the driver side and not returned it to what it was set for by me.  The height was wrong; the distance from steering wheel was wrong; the steering wheel height adjustment was wrong.  If the Tech doing the work on the vehicle or the employee moving the vehicle into the service bay adjusts the driver's seat, then they should put it back to the original position or just leave it alone. I know this is an easy thing to solve but it is an inconvenience to the owner.< /text>

We have had a great experience at Audi Fletcher Jones in Costa Mesa. Our main service rep has been Jose, and I can't say enough great things about him. If we have any issues or just basic maintenance on our vehicle, I know I can always rely on Jose for assistance. He is honest and doesn't try to upsell us on anything. I really appreciate that.</review>

<Text>Came in for 45k Service and a recall repair. At time of pick up, we noticed 2 service faults on our MMI. Turns out that the tech that serviced my vehicle did not secure a drive hose that he previously removed in order to perform the service he was doing. It ended producing a really loud grinding sound from the wheels and also caused the two error faults on the MMI. We took the car right back to Audi. Jose Magana quickly apologized for the issue and promised us that he would make sure that this was resolved and to trust that the work performed has been checked. He did just that and my car was ready for pick up the next morning. Jose has always been an advocate for us in making sure the repairs performed are done right.</Text>< user_name>
