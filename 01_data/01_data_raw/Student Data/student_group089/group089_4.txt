Old school pizza oven that makes the pizza melt in your mouth. Oh the owner is not cheap with the ingredients, these pizzas come fully loaded.

This pizzeria is amazing! Their customer service, timing and promptness are hands down, the best in the business. The pizza is unlike others. Even the small shops. It's hardy, perfectly baked, not greasy and made to your order. I wanted extra garlic. Hell yeah, they delivered. Eat here says Dan!

Edit 17DEC20: I ordered a different pizza than I normally do. This time it was a King Arthur's Supreme, thin crust, extra sauce. The bake was spot on. Thin dough and the sauce didn't make the pizza soggy! I ordered for a future delivery time and it arrived right on time. The pizza was so hot and fresh. The quality is as consistent as In N Out, if not better. Best comfort food for these cold days and having to stay indoors. Thanks everyone at this La Mesa location!<//Text>

Good pizza, great service.  Ordered supreme pizza.  No need for a salad with this pizza, the pizza toppings were piled high and had good flavor.    The crust was firm and had the right amount of crunch.  The pizza could have a little more sauce, I made comment to the owner and he said, oh just ask for more sauce, well give it to you.  Great customer service.  They gave us anchovies in the side as well.   5 stars over all.  I read a review about bathrooms being dirty.  I didn't see any issues. Bathroom was  Clean and well kept< /review>

<review>Wow!!! I am on a quest to find the best pizza... I think I found the perfect pizza! This location really honors the name Round Table Pizza. Very clean, the employees are very kind and best of all, tasty pizza. They're very generous with the ingredients they put on it. Willing to drive out of my way just to get this piece of deliciousness; this tiny piece of heaven landing on my tastes buds. Congratulations to the manager and staff. Will be back soon! 👏👍 ♥️</review></record>

Wow.  Used to order this all the time when I lived in La Mesa.  In town, tried to order delivery, and got barked at like being a customer was a burden to the young woman on the phone.  Considered driving over for their amazing pizza, but remembered there's hundreds of businesses struggling to stay open.  Not today, guys.<//review>

I chose to drive further to a different Roy table after the rudeness of the gentleman answering the phone!

First time I called and was asked to be put on hold and he never put me on hold I could here everything in the back ground for 20 min so I hung up and called again hoping to get a different operator

When I called back he asked what I wanted I told him and instantly said ok we’ll see you when you get here, I said wait I’m not done yet.... no way were they going to make my pizza with that kind of attitude. He never even asked if I’d like anything else. Very bad for business!</review>

In this COVID it's important to recognize our essential workers when possible.
Round Table has a Grrrr-8 Menu, Meat and Vegan Lovers Alike,
Salads, Soft drinks and Delivery.
Back at CVS, they Luv'd Lunch ~ and the gesture.
Treat your essentials to RoundTable too.<//review>< user_id>

I can understand if a restaurant no longer provides an item, but what is not acceptable is not letting a customer know before hand. They did refund me and provided no apology.
Round Table makes great food but I just suggest traveling a little further to the next Round Table for better service.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1581455203922, 'text': 'Ebony, we are disappointed that we let you down with your online order.

My dad is visiting and walked by the place while I shopped and came to tell me that we just had to go because it smelled amazing. He said “he totally has that door opened because he knows how great it smells in there!” He wasn’t wrong and that rarely happens. We ordered our food to go and it was amazing. They even made us free garlic cheesy knots and said “I made you a surprise!” It was a friendly place and I look forward to visiting again soon!</review>

Went here tonight with my girlfriend because we had a gift card. Upon arrival I go to pick up the order and give the gentleman my gift card. Total was 48.78. He asked me how much was on the gift card. I said $50, he told me he was gonna give me a discount and then charged the card the entire $50 and then asked if he could throw it away. Well thats not sketchy at all. Must be the franchise owner. The food tasted good except the cinnamon twists were doughy and tasted like they were made of a cleaning agent. My order # was 7216430 just incase anyone from corporate wishes to validate my claim. I have the receipt showing that he charged me $50. Will not be back to this location. I will also forward this too the company as I want someone to look into this. Not happy at all.</Review>

Son received a free pizza coupon from school with the words no purchase necessary written boldly on the front. the owner refused to honor the coupon without buying something. Funny thing was, my plan was to purchase a lunch for my self but I will not do business with anyone that wont honor their own word.</review>

<text>I've had Round Table Pizza before and love it, just not at this location. This place is filthy and after reading other reviews- they’ve failed health inspections. The bathroom looks like it's hardly ever cleaned, no soap to wash our hands (it was only 11am), soda machine was sticky and dirty, same with tables and chairs. The salad bar had a dead moth in the lettuce that my husband brought to their attention. They gave us our money back for that, but didn't replace the lettuce for other customers.... I wouldn't recommend this location, but recommend Round Table Pizza!< /text>< Pictures>

We got there before my order was done manager came to us with 2 beverage containers said drinks are on the house.  Our order was done within 10 minutes it was my fault i didn't unmentioned i wanted deep dish pizza.  The manager gave me a personal deep dish pizza.  He didn't have to do that it was my fault.  Manager and employees were very nice and professionals.  Manager went out of his way to make sure i was happy and satisfied!
Thank you for the great service. Now these days service is so aweful.  Today was an amazing service at this round table restaurant...<//Text>

It looks like new owners. Store is super clean, tables are cleaned as soon as customers leave the store. The pizzas we're extremely tasty and cooked to perfection. Did enjoy revisiting this store after not seeing it for several years. I will go back< /review>

Place was kind of small but cozy. Came in for the 11 to 2 lunch buffet. They kept the pizza coming with a nice variety. Veggie pizzas to the Everything on them type. 8.99 gets you all u can eat pizza including salad and drinks. Employees where friendly. Roundtable makes good pizza.</text>

The garlic bread sticks were amazing! The service and cleanliness were not. There were dirty tables all thru the place. One girl was working the counter, serving and cooking while the busser hid in the back, a manager had timecards and whatnot strewn all over the first table while another girl in Round table garb played on her phone behind the fireplace. This place is in need of a culture change.<//review>

Just moved to the area, and the staff were so welcoming! Salad bar is fresh and well stocked. The blue cheese dressing is fabulous! We like crispy pizza, so they made sure it had the perfect crunch. Plenty of toppings. Cold beer, clean utensils, plates, glasses, etc... we will definitely make this a regular eating spot.< /Review>

I asked for a personal pan pizza.  I did not get a personal pan pizza. I got a regular pizza.  I was not pleased.  I did not put up a fuss though. I ate what i received without complaint.  Will I go back there, no.  Will i recommend it, no.< /Review>

<Review>It was pretty good, the pizza was good as well as the salad. The reason for the 3 stars is because you basically get  a tea cup saucer to place your food on instead of plates and bowls.  I imagine this helps cut down on wasting food but come on! They consider a small soup bowl the salad bowl. They need to just get adult sized plates and bowls or just call it a tiny tot buffet so customers know what they're getting in to.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

We were promptly greeted and gave our orders. We were given an estimated time before our pizza's would be ready. They were brought to our table and were straight from the oven! No matter where we have Round Table plzza from Anchorage, AK to La Mesa CA, they're always the very best..."bar none!"</Text>

These guys at Round Table are the best neighbors.  They are always there for us in times of need.  We had a situation today at my shop where I needed a certain power cord for a receipt printer and they delivered.  The owners of Round Table La Mesa have always had our back and are the best neighbors we could ever ask for.  Last but definitely not least, they treat you like family when you done, the pizza rocks not to mention the pizza knots - a must have</review>

Not bad for little kids though and actually, Round Table is still one of the better places if you do have little kids.

Never had a bad experience here.  The lunch buffet is a great value.  Their pizza is always fresh when ordered outside the buffet special.</Review>

<Text>Owners a jerk! We ordered all u can eat salad specified individual salads for four. We were given plates by the cashier. Upon serving the owner comes up and starts saying we didnt pay for salads just one. I mentioned he should explaining this to his cashier not me but he kept on and on about it. Trifling about it...then finally acknowledging the accountability of his cashier. Very unprofessional behavior I feel the whole conversation should of been isolated to his staff not the customer. The order was clear to the cashier who erred.<//Text>< Pics>

Ive been coming to this place for the Lunch Buffet for more than 6 years. The staff is always friendly and the bread sticks are my favorite.  I only gave 2 stars because I witnessed a very unsanitary act by a staff member. I was helping myself to a serving of pizza and what looked like a busboy came around counter and touched the pizza with his hand and walked in the back. The nice young girl working saw it and immediately pulled that tray of pizza and later apologized to me for having to witness that.  Hopefully this wont ruin my experience here cause like i said in the beginning i been coming here for years.  So hopefully the management team properly trains their staff on Food Safety.< /Text>

Pizza is always great here, friendly staff, the owner & his brother are really nice.
We have been going there for about 12 years.

One of my biggest restaurant issues is dirty stinky carpet and trying to keep that smell away from enjoying my food.This round table is clean that way.

The only thing I could even try to complain about is the cook with the tribal ear thing going on. He winks at me in a strange way when I come in, I have mixed feelings about the possible code in that. He may just have terets or something so I won't say anything.</Review>

< review>
I have always loved Round Table, ever since my girlfriend... now wife worked there in the 80's.  It's not gourmet, but its very good, especially the pepperoni.  We recently moved into the neighborhood and visited this location for the first time yesterday.  They have a great spot in the La Mesa Springs shopping center with lots of parking, although its well within walking distance for us.

Our pizza was great... brought back lots of good memories and was just how we remembered it.  The sauce has a nice little zing to it and our pizza was piping hot when it got to the table.  Our server was pleasant and helpful.  I had a root beer because that's what you do at Round Table.  My wife had a glass of wine.   She's fancy.

This would be a 4 or 5 star review except that the restaurant was dirty.  The men's room was "deplorable" to use a current term... and the rest of the place needs a good deep cleaning.   I know its a pizza place that serves a lot of children and young people.. I understand how it got dirty... but i think they are little to comfortable leaving it that way.  I nosed around a bit, and the kitchen actually looks fine, and I will come back to this place for sure... but maybe more for take out than eat in.< /review>

<Review>You know when you are seriously in the mood for really great pizza...like it's totally gotta satisfy that BAAAAD craving? We ended up at Round Table Pizza on La Mesa Blvd and I'm sooooo glad we did! Specifically this location (8032 La Mesa Blvd, La Mesa, CA) has the sweetest owner (thank you for the complimentary salad bar) and makes a perfect crust of not being doughy or too thin with the perfect crunch and loaded with toppings!! Toppings mountain high and all the way to the edge!! It was like a pizza lover's dream come true!! 😉 And we got to enjoy it sitting in front of a warm toasty fireplace on a cold rainy day!Officially an absolute favorite on my list and they just earned a loyal repeat customer.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80d95723bdbe3b8b:0x40ae68d551a7206<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Went there for the lunch buffet.  Food was okay,  not the greatest. A little pricey.</Review>

< Review>
Whats up with this place ? Went there last week and picked up order to go. Wife and I BOTH got really sick and I went back to let the restaurant know and see if others got sick. Got there and the place is closed ! Windows are papered over and someone working there said they were remodeling. I checked with the health department to see if others got sick recently, after I told them I couldn't contact the restaurant they said the store is currently closed for health violations! Now I think I should visit my doctor.<//Review>

My husband and I ordered the garlic chicken specialty pizza for delivery and it was probably the best pizza we have ever had delivered!  I would highly recommend not only this pizza but Round Table Pizza for the best pizza take out in San Diego!<//Review>

I came for a pizza buffet, but that was over. I ordered a personal pizza, salad and a drink, $16.92. I think that's too expensive for a place like this.< /Review>

I went to this location over New Year's weekend. The pizza was cold,  the dining area was dirty and the bathroom was disgusting. I will not be back.  I found out a week later that there was a sign out front saying they were forced to close by the Environmental Health Department.<//review>

I have been to other T-Mobile stores that are much closer to my house but have not received this level of great customer service . He should be moved up in ranks most likely CEO one day. I am happy to comeback when the time comes for future purchases/ help.

Worst costumer service. The manager Tim and the other gal Kristina will lie about promotions just to get you to sign up and then lie to you and say you’re the liar when you need help.</review>

<review>Called to see if they had a particular brand/model in stock before sending mother-in law down to purchase a replacement phone. She is in Calif because her father just passed away and current Samsung (galaxy s7) had zero battery life.  After confirmation, I sent her down to get the phone and would walk her through transferring the data using the built in app on the new phone. Didn't know, but this located activated the sim and didn't tell anyone. Had to call customer support to figure why the sim swap wasn't working.  In addition, this location added insurance without telling anyone just to boost their sales. Avoid this location and hope they stop shady practices. Being transparent goes a long way.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Excellent service! Sales associate Anthony was very knowledgeable about the latest devices and functions available through T-mobile. In addition to what I was looking for, Anthony even offered the latest devices and features that are very useful, and that I needed. Anthony was also very good at installing the devices and explaining how to use them. Other sales associates and the store assistant manager Cyrus was also very knowledgeable and helpful. The parking lot is very large, and there are many parking spaces all the time.</Text>

They answered all our questions and walked us through exactly how the process works. I was very pleased how patient and informative Jason was. He even made sure I was completely set up with an online account before leaving! Thanks!!<//text><user>100912745991722182231< /user>< gmapID>

I spent 2 months reading professional reviews about T Mobile and their services and signal strength.  These reviews were not customer based, but professional organizations.  After exhaustive research I decided to start saving $$$$$$ over my current service.  Then I met the new workers at this new Arroyo Grande location.  The customer service has been outstanding.  My entire family is now switching to T Mobile because of a far better service and customer service.  Thank you guys.</Review>

Was helped out by a very professional man today that went by the name of Christopher Walters, from when I walked in he offered help right off the bat and gave very knowledgeable information! Was a very pleasant experience and will continue to return as a customer every time to this specific store! Definitely deserves an ASM position.</Text>

<Review>Here's the thing, I was with Verizon for eons until my wife saw T-mobile's ad for an amazing veterans deal. We talked it over and went for it. We both got brand new iPhone Xrs and a nice unlimited plan.
I never once had a signal issue in all my years with Verizon, but as soon as we got rolling on the way home I went from 2 bars of LTE to 1 to 4G in the course of just driving from their store to the AG side of the Mesa. At home I get 2 bars at most and have calls drop. I can't text or even call my wife to ask her a question from inside Costco or the other stores I went to in Santa Maria the week before Thanksgiving.
With the holidays I was unable to make it back to the store before the 14 day return policy. I'm a disabled vet and don't get around as much as I'd like to be able to.
Taking my phone to Verizon I find out that T-mobile buys a model of the iPhone Xr that only has one antenna built in and cannot be used on any other carrier than AT&T after being unlocked. The other major carriers buy iPhone Xrs that have 2 antennas built in so that after paying off the phone it can be unlocked and used on any network.
Went into the store and was told it's out of their hands and to call 611 and see if they can override the 14 day policy. after 1 hour and 4 minutes being bounced between 7 different people in India, several of them told me it was up to the store I got them at, eventually I was told they would let me ship the phones back but I would still have to pay for them. (right...)
So now my wife and I have 2 3 week old iPhone Xrs which we have to pay off for $1500 and can't use them going back to Verizon. To top it all off who's going to want to buy a phone that won't work on a real network around SLO county?
Friggin nightmare of an experience and a waste of a ton of money for 2 paperweights.</Review><name>brian roberts< /name><date>1543280161930</date><gmap_id>0x80ec5eeac9c22ddd:0x7c8f4241327bc600</gmap_id>< user_id>

My experience was terrific.  The technician I worked with, Amanda, as well as the additional staff, were very kind, patient, hard working, knowledgeable and efficient.  The location is safe and there is plenty of parking and of course the facility and its resources are excellent.  I would recommend this place to anybody who needs to do a sleep study.  Thank you!<//Text>

<Review>Place looked clean and smelled clean. Your employees were overworked, your facility was overbooked, my appointment was at 9:45 and It was 1 hour and 15 minutes before I attended to. There were 5 people that evening for a sleep study and you only had 2 technicians working. Additionally, I filed the paperwork on line and for whatever reason your technicians could not access it, and I had to redo all the forms and questionnaire, so I recommend you warn people on your website or via email, that way if they have an early day the next day, they can plan accordingly and maybe book themselves for 7:30PM if they plan to be in bed by 9:00PM.

One more thing, for some inexplicable reason, there is an 16 square inch hole cut out of the ceiling tile directly above your head when you are laying down. I thought it was for a camera for the study, came to find out its a landlord issue, they never fixed it, so you are staring into the ceiling space as you drift away, wondering if a rat is going to peer its head out the hole, but I kept telling myself the place looked too clean to have rats, and off I drifted to sleep.</Review><response>None< /response><Rating>3</Rating>< user>

I was a bit uncomfortable that there was not a female there when or while my test was performed. The gentleman that performed the test seemed to be in a rush but did explain what he was doing. All in all I would have liked to have someone with me during the test.< /Text>

< review>
I have no problems with the room and its cleanlyness. This was my 3rd sleep study and never had as bad an experience as this one. The technitian (Bernard) was thorough but not overly friendly and at the end very sharp and went to office and closed the door. My last 2 sleep studies required I sleep without machine half of night and then after seeing the apnea and snoring and such would place me on machine to determine adequate pressures...this guy says to me oh no we are not doing it like this now because of covid...you will not have a machine...whatttt!!!! I know I wont do well and will have a horrible night like this. .. why do a sleep study this way? There is no point to it other than make money from insurance...I'm very upset and have told this to my doctors office and they stated that there are many complaints about this particular center...well...stop sending people there...yes, the bedding is wonderful and rooms are comfortable and clean, but so is my room at home ...i dont recommend this place because of this. It was a horrible night experience!!!< /review>

This was probably the most uncomfortable and unprofessional experience i have ever had. There were several issues that need to be address starting with me being left overnight in a strange surrounding with a man i had never been introduced to. He was abrupt and verbally abusive, he was not helpful and very inattentive, had no compassion and unengaged. This person is not an asset to your organization and should not be in that position. Who made the decision that he would be able to be a good representation for your company?????

In addition, when i was released he removed the wires from my body, but not the stickers, and didnt even tell me! so when i arrived at a local market for coffee, i had attachments all over me....and my  hair had goop in it that i was not aware of or had any direction as to how to remove it...very unprofessional release of a patient half asleep!!!!

the facility did not take into consideration that anything other than sleeping would be done in the room. I arrived early enough to watch television programs, but can not do it in a bed, my back needs support and there was no chair!, the bedside stand was only big enough to facilitate the necessary equipment of the SLEEP STUDY. There wasn't even any place to put my glasses or my water bottle....has anyone given that consideration???? and there was no temperature control in the room, so i was sweating all night in spite of the fan that was blowing directly on me. Additionally one of the pillow covers had blood spots on it. This room was not prepared or sufficient for ANY patients needs...yuck

I will say that Amanda, who welcomed me was very kind and cordial, she explained everything, and helped me with getting comfortable in spite of the inefficiencies in the room. Her compassion and understanding were appreciated.

There are obviously some issues the company needs to address, and in speaking with my Primary Care physician about the experience he was APPALLED!!!< /text>

Excellent experience.  My technician was kind, gentle and explained each part of the testing procedure.  Room was spotless and the mattress was so comfortable.  Can you tell me the brand please?</Text>

<name>Deborah Nelson<//name><Text>Sure wish someone would contact me by calling so I don't end up with the wrong uncomfortable mask just because the techs doing the sleep study ran out of the size in the mask that was the most comfortable for me. Had to do the sleep study with a mask that had buckets under my ears and very tight across my cheeks which made my sinuses really hurt!. Made arrangements to have extra pillows for under my knees with the lady who answered the phone but when I got to the sleep study the techs said no notes in my chart. Was very uncomfortable ,have spinal stenosis so don't trust what they say. Bring your own pillows.< /Text>< pictures>

Staff was great and professional but I was placed in a room right next to the bathroom so every time some used the bathroom the would slam the door upon entering and exiting which woke me up. I did not sleep but about 1 hr the entire night<//Text>

<review>Natalys is the Best Taco Shop in Town! For anyone to review this Taco joint any less than 5 stars obviously does not know genuine MEXICAN food. The taste of Mexico is in every bite! Everything on the menu is FIRE, I know because we just had a graduation party for a Family member and Natalys pulled through with the conversation of the night, their FOOD. Customer service was Phenomenal handling such a big order in the peak of Covid19. I felt safe entering Natalys as they exercise all the latest safety precautions in light of Covid19 outlined by the CDC. I was impressed! If your in the mood for Real Mexican Food don’t look any Further Natalys is the one stop Taco Shop!
I highly recommend Natalys without reservation or hesitation to all my family, friends and the community of Ontario as well as all the surrounding cities.
Great Food and Great People.....

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>Nataly's is a good little hole in the wall, pretty much everything I have tried I thoroughly enjoyed (probably over-enjoyed considering how many orders of tacos I get whenever I go here), there are definitely a few exceptions on their menu but I think that boils down to personal preference because theres items on their menu that I'm just not a fan of period regardless of where it comes from. That being said my personal favorites are their al pastor tacos, their birria, their rice, and oddly enough their french fries are pretty good as well. My wife loves their chorizo in pretty much every form they have there and they also have a self serve salsa bar which is great because their salsas are amazing as well. Definitely worth going and trying if you haven't tried it already. Welp thats all for now and as always, stay hungry my friends.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Rosa is an absolute sweetheart! Everytime I go in I get great food and service I'm hooked on the Birria tacos (they are spicy) their salsa bar is quality over quantity and I really appreciate that too!! They treat everyone so kindly and the cooks really know what they're doing in the kitchen! This is a must stop for taco Tuesday $1 TACOS!!!< /Text>

<Review>They have a little salsa bar. Tacos come with salsa on it, and if you don't like spicy, get them plain and add what you're able to handle. Beans are spicy too. Horchata is pretty good here.< /Review>< pictures>

A friend brought me here for lunch. Great authentic Mexican food. Clean. Rated "A" with the State. Only negative would be the TV volume was way too Loud. You should definitely stop by when you're hungry.<//Review>

Wake up feeling awful, crawl to night stand and call this spot to place an order of menudo many times. The staff are always sweet and prepare orders pretty quicl. My "go-to" spot for menudo on the weekend... pricing is about average, but worth it.  Ohhh,  and their tacos and burritos are pretty dank too. =]<//review>

I come here often, It is a good place to eat authentic mexican food. They charge you extra to use a debit card which i dont think is fair other then that, Its clean and delicious, and treat u with respect.</Text>

Great hard working people with a good amount of common sense and decent prices. He told me I could get two exhaust tips welded up for $100. $50 a side. Which isn't bad considering it's gonna look really nice. Better than I could do it.</Text>

<Text>BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE! If there was a way to put no stars I would... 9 months ago I took my car in and $2000 later the owner threaten to knock me out and have my car towed away after months of him putting me off and not repairing my vehicle. He does not give receipts and will refuse to give you one, his claim is you don't like it take it somewhere else! Beware of this place!<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Found a mechanic that was  near  a Auto Zone that read a code ( ENG dash lamp)
Thank you AutoZone...... AutoZone Did not recommend anyone but I found a mechanic 2 blocks away that also ran the code and. And they said yes certainly we can fix this.
There was a problem in locating the part they found the part in San Bernardino and had it brought to their shop. The new part was installed. The owner of T & M mufflers and his assistant sorry I can't remember his name were very businesslike and good and they did not rip me off five star rating thank you Alan T & M mufflers. Very Good People
If I have a problem near T & M it will be the 1st place I stop. I owned a business for 30 years... THIS IS REAL HONEST PEOPLE
I HAVE NEVER reported 5 STAR. Be fore
this one....THANKS ALAN!</review>< Time>

I brought in a Toyota Matrix that had some very challenging problems a hard to find catalytic converter but Alan tracked one down for me and istalled it ASAP. After that I payed for the repair and drove around the block and came right back because I had a check engine light. Alan’s crew got right on it and found another problem in the ignition system they literally preformed a miracle by removing a broken off piece of the threaded end of a spark plug out of the hole saving me Hundreds of dollars in engine head replacement and I am very impressed that they were able to do the seemingly impossible. The car is running fine now and ready for it’s emissions test. Thank you Alan and crew at T&M muffler<//text>

I was told I would have to pay a little more because they needed a special part that didn't show up on their system. Nobody's fault but when I went to pay, they honored the original price. It was inconvenient to not have my car a couple extra days but I will alway reward honesty and integrity with repeat patronage as I will T and M Muffler. Thank you Tim.</Text>< Time>

I called T and M Mufflers on Tuesday August 14th and spoke with Allen. I told lold him my 1997 Fleetwood Bounder has check engine lights and asked is they do that type of  diagnostic work . Alan said yes and to bring it in Wed (the 15th). I did and then called wed night to check on it and he said his code reader didn’t pick up the codes. I told him I have a code reader that I bought from Autozone and it is in the motorhome that he could use.  I didn’t hear from him the following day so Friday the 17th I called once again and was told he needed to replace some bolts on the exhaust manifold. I okayed the work not know the price and then waited for it to be done. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday went by and I didn’t hear anything so I called T and M at 4:30pm Wednesday. An unidentified person answered the phone and said it has been done.  I asked him how much do I owe. He said he didn’t know because there wasn’t any paperwork written up on it and he told me to call back in 10 minutes and talk to Allen who I later identified as the owner of the business.  When I called back Allen said, “what do you think is fair?” And “what did I charge you last time?” I explained to him that last time he replaced the exhaust manifold on the opposite side for me and that he charged me $600. Allen said “well how about $500” At this point I didn’t feel comfortable doing business with him anymore so I told him fine I’ll pick it up and that will be the last time you work on it. I went to pick it up half hour later and Alan immediately confronted Me saying how much work it was. I told him I was concerned because I didn’t get any phone calls explaining the scope of the work and that it seemed like A lot of money to just replace three bolts. At this point my wife started recording the interaction and that is where Allen started yelling and cussing at me. After he charged me the $500 plus an unexpected $17.50 “SVC” he then walks by me and my wife and says.. “That was an easy job, took 5 minutes”

**Update**
I called the business back the next day and attempted to resolve the issue but the owner hung up on me .
Complaint filed with California bureau of automotive repair and the Better Business Bureau.
The video is already on social media.</review>

<text>Great new pizza place in downtown Livermore. Delicious pizza (I'd highly recommend the garlic chicken Detroit-style pizza). They also had excellent service (it's counter serve, but the employees were very friendly, and quick to bus/clean tables). Plus a decent selection of craft beers. And solid portion sizes, for reasonable prices. Can't really ask for more!< /text>< pictures>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Wanted to try this place since it opened. We were fans of Cravings, the pizza place before located here. We were happy to see that they too had a Detroit style pizza, so I tried it with pepperoni and sausage. It was awesome! Light doughy crust, crispy edges, and tasty toppings. Definitely recommend. The inside has been nicely remodeled, and nice also that they have outdoor seating.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlNDgllYLbq2GVhyFfK3TbJyF-o32UXFDFaPDy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Response>

<text>Pizza is excellent and at a very good price. The thin crust pizza is slightly larger than what you'd get at Blaze Pizza for $2 more, but it's way better. Definitely worth checking if you're in the mood for some pizza!</text>< Pics>

First time here in mid Sept ‘19.  We enjoyed our pizza so much that we went back the next evening!  Love all the different options and great service!  They also carry one of my favorite wine brand so it’s all good!  Cloud9 is becoming our Friday night go to place!  Yummy!!!!< /Review>

Can't say enough good things about this place. Great pizza, good value, good service, awesome Batch soda.  This is now our go to pizza place.

Edit...I wrote this review 2 weeks ago and just learned that they have closed for good. It's too bad because this place was great. They will be missed :(<//Text>

<Text>I must be coming here on the wrong nights, reading some of these other reviews that are so positive. I’ve been here twice and had a bad experience both times. First time the pizza was pretty good, fairly middle of the road, but after ordering and waiting 30 minutes I had to ask where our food was and it seemed like they forgot and then we got it in 15 minutes. Decided to give them another shot tonight and the same thing happened. I ordered a burger and a beer, my friends ordered wings and a salad. After waiting 40 minutes we asked about our food and the guy went to ask about it. Once again our food showed up 15 minutes later. My burger was dry and looked like they went and got it from Jack in the box, which would’ve been an upgrade. My friends  “Caesar” salad looked absolutely disgusting. The cherry on top was that the service was horrible, no apology for the wait or anything. I won’t be back.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< UserId.>

Nice update inside. Easy menu. Decent beer selection. We went with regular crust and thick crust options. Good combos and ingredients, fast service, prices reasonable too. I would suggest using cornmeal or less flour to keep the crust from sticking as the current ratio makes for a bit too much flour for my taste.<//review>

Excellent pies. The quality of the ingredients was also top-notch. Definitely going here again.

Do try out the jalapeno oil on your slice for a good kick.</Text>

Great pizza and beer. Kids get a free pizza on Wednesdays. They just started to serve burgers as well, so that's a nice option. Place hasn't been busy every time I've been there, so there's no problem getting fast service or a table. Just found out today that they also offer vegan cheese even though it's not listed on their menu. Definitely recommend! Go check them out!< /text>

Good place for pizza and beer, a somewhat casual atmosphere good for family or group of friends. Quality and available selection of pizza very good. Would rate it 4 on scale of 1 -5. 5 being unbeatable.< /Text>

I've never been here and I was going to get just a regular pizza and the guy said they had a lunch special. So I said sure and wow the pizza is amazing. Crispy and chewy, just how I like it. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. I wish I got 2 now but that just means I have to go back another time for more. That was definitely the best pizza I've had in a very long time.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<Date>1560484014753< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><Name>Kara Lawson</Name><review>Took 2 of my grandchildren to lunch there this afternoon. I heard the pizza wasn’t bad so I figured we would try it out.
Arrived at the restaurant at 12:15 pm. Approximately 4 or 5 people were eating in the outdoor dining area. We opted to eat inside. We walked in and the entire restaurant was empty. A bit strange given the time of day. My instincts told me to leave, however we decided to take a booth and sit. At 12:20pm, (printed on my receipt), our order was placed and we seated ourselves. We left the restaurant at 1:40pm without ever getting our lunch. The owner visited our table twice during this 1 hour and 20 minute period and informed us that do to the delay, he would give us a scoop of gelato free of charge.
When we left at 1:40 I did not get a refund, an apology, or even a good bye. Frankly, don’t care about the refund, just wanted out.
I will never return to this establishment, ever.
I will never recommend it to anyone as well.
I would be quite surprised if their business survived another 30 days.

< Review>
I had the thin crust and it came out burnt.  The sauce is just ok and while you can have as many toppings as you want for the same price,  they don't put a lot of cheese or toppings.   My husband had the deep dish and said it was good.   Probably won't go back<//Review>

Amazing! Love the atmosphere, and love that they have cauli crust and GF crust options. Toppings selection is great as well. My hubby and I differ in pizza preference so the “personal pizza to order” is perfect. :)</Review>

Dr. Raymond is the best!! He not only takes care of my fur-babies but also all of my family's pets. He has been the most amazing vet we could ask for on an every visit basis but he also saved our cat's life when no one else could. We highly recommend Placerville Animal Wellness!< /review>

I concur with all the praise for Dr. Raymond and his wonderful staff. I trust no one more than Dr. Raymond for the care and advice he provides to me about my precious pets. And he does so with compassion and without the slightest hint of greed for money by prescribing unneeded treatments or medication. Long live Dr. Raymond. Love PAWS to the max!<//Review>

Prices are very fair and would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking to find a trustworthy vet to take thier pets to. I also like the fact that he takes walk in appointment's from 4pm till about 5:30pm the days  thier business is open.  Makes it very convenient. Over all I give 5 stars plus on this veterinary clinic .<//review></record></dataset><record>

I've been bringing my baby to Dr Raymond his entire life. First time we had an emergency and Dr and his staff were as attentive and professional since our first visit.  Thank you for taking such attention to help Joey! He's resting well. I highly recommend Dr Raymond.< /review>

< Review>
Came back after 2years . Lot better clinic environment. The assistants in the office were very polite and nice unlike the office person 2 years ago  who was obnoxious and hard to work with.. I hope Dr. Raymond will keep his current staff and I don't Ming going back again for my pets needs.< /Review>

If it weren't for them, I wouldn't be able to care for any pet. They are the absolute best! The Veterinarian, on a scale of 1-10,  He is definitely a 15! I have never known  anyone who works there to be anything but nice, caring and patient. (Even with older people, who need it most) not that I'm old. Lol ok, a little. I would recommend this place to everyone.  They put your pet before money!</Review>

<Review>Dr. Raymond is our family's hero. There is no better vet in the world. I kid you not. He has been wonderful to my baby girls and has done surgery on several of them over the years with no issues. His depth and breadth of knowledge plus his experience is second to none.

He is so good with animals and everytime I take my girls, I am in awe of his way with them. They trust him too!  I would happily pay 2X as much for his services if I needed to. I am so grateful to have him as our vet. Love him and his staff.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Helpers of animal and humankind alike, Dr, Raymond and his staff at Placerville Animal Wellness embody the qualities that make the world a better place.  Generous beyond measure, you needn't spend much time there to understand his mission- exemplary service with compassion and dignity for all.   We were referred to Dr. Raymond when our beloved cat was gravely injured, due to multiple rattlesnake bites.  With the utmost of care and treatment by Dr. Raymond, she is recovering and still with us.  Dr. Raymond's time, care, effort and generosity with our cat fills our hearts with joy and gratitude.  I am reminded of a quote by St. Francis, Patron Saint of Animals..."Start by doing what's necessary, then do what's possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible".  Thank you Dr. Raymond, for making the seemingly impossible, possible.  The world is a better place with you in it.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809a5710b5ce34af:0xc98a34def04b6f5<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>What a horrible experience.  The receptionist "office manager " was so rude and very unprofessional.  I cannot believe her lack of empathy concerning our 16 year old dying dog. I was hung up on three times because she refuses to listen and talks over me. I wanted to make a complaint about her lack of customer service and the disregard we got when calling in. She is the "office manager " and my complaint was about her so I asked to talk with the doctor and she said she would need to know what its concerning so she could pass the info along. I think her name is Lori? Anyways she asked my complaint, I tried many times to tell her and she talked over me. arguing with me, and then hung up!!! I'm sure the doctor will never know about this encounter as she probably won't share with him my complaint of her terrible attitude. But I do hope he sees this. Dr. You really need someone who can be caring and has customer service. She is running people off with her bad attitude.  I know if it was my business I would want to know.< /Text>< Pictures>

This doctor has the best prices around. And he's fast. If you're looking for a doctor to sit and chat with you about all the neurotic things you feel about your pet this is not the place to go. But for cheap quick and friendly service this is the place for you. Dr. Raymond will answer any neurotic questions that you have through his email and he responds quite quickly. Dr. Raymond figured out how to service the community in the most effective way< /review>

Walking in here, I noticed that this place had a very calm, safe energy. It wasn't scary for my dog to come in. She is a pretty nervous dog, and she wasnt bothered at all. The staff was all very nice and welcoming. Dr. Raymond was incredibly gentle with her and made her feel safe. He explained to me how easy it could be to rack up a very large bill doing testing (like over $1500 in one day), so he didn't want to do any unnecessary tests. He came up with what he thought would be the most important and informative tests to start figuring out what was wrong with my dog, and gave me a price that was as low as he could go without losing money himself. He seems to be a very compassionate, caring person. I would recommend this office 1000x over. You wouldnt regret coming here.</text>

We took our dog Grady a Boykin Spaniel to a number of Vets and after we became frustrated with Western Vet care we came here as a last resort. This place is amazing and Dr. Raymond has really nailed the issues and Grady is much better because of it.

Highest Praise!!!!!!!!!!</text>

This is not my regular vet but I have been using PV Animal Wellness Clinic more and more over the past few years. Dr. Raymond is a compassionate animal care giver and has done an awesome job on several animals we've brought in. He also cares much about people in order to provide affordable care visits to people when the typical veterinary office charges $50 just to see your pet. I highly recommend his office to anyone. He takes great care of pets! Thank you Dr Raymond for coming to Placerville.<//Text>

< Review>
I'm very dissapointted, I had heard so many great things about this vet. I took my 1 year pit mix, she is terrified of everything and everybody and barks to try to appear scary. She has never hurt anyone. The vet did not greet her but instead pulled her back legs to try and get her to lie down. She did not like being manhandled and started freaking out. The vet refused to see her because she was too aggressive even though he was the one being aggressive. The receptionist and other staff there were very kind and I appreciate them for that. I plan to find a vet who will actually try and get to know my dog before shoving her to the ground. Definitely not reccomending this place to anyone.</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>Hours are for walk-ins. They close a little bit after the times listed. We received high quality and affordable care from Dr. Raymond. He may have added another year to our time with our aging cat. Renal failure will probably take him, but Dr. Raymond dealt swiftly and aggressively with what he suspected and confirmed to be an aggressive, cancerous growth. We would have had to put him down before he was ready with the prices and inefficient services our regular vet was piling on while the growth only grew and the risk for spreading increased. Thank you, Dr. Raymond!< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I believe Dr. Raymond at the Placerville Animal Wellness Clinic is a gifted veterinarian. He just seems to instinctually know what needs to be done to help your pet. Our cat, Kiko, disappeared for several days and when he returned he was dehydrated and could hardly stand up. He was a very sick cat. I took him to Dr. Raymond and he suspected a viral infection. He treated him and then stayed in contact with us the entire time Kiko was healing. I have no doubt he saved our cat.  Thank you Dr. Raymond. You are a real asset to our community.< /Text>

<review>I would like to encourage any one who has a dog with a back/spine/ disk problem to visit Dr. Raymond to discuss alternative accupuncture treatments. We brought our 9 yr.old mini-dachsund to Dr Raymond after 3 visits to our usual vet yielded no results for a sudden back end paralysis that happened when our dog ran down 2 porch steps, let out a pain yelp and could not lift up his back end! The original vet took X-Rays, "found nothing" and offered to refer to a neurology vet for possible surgery ($1,000+ for diagnostics + $5,000+ surgery) Over the past 3 weeks, Dr Raymond did 3 accupuncture Rx's- after each Rx, there was marked improvement starting the very1st day after the 1st Rx!!! Our dog now walks bearing weight/moving all 4 legs! His gait improves daily! Dr. Raymond rates so high on our list!!!- Thank You!!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

There were 2 registers open, and the lines are moving slow. Yet, there were no lights showing who was open. I had to get in and out quickly, because of being high risk with this pandemic. I was getting frustrated, and asked Devon who was open. She was very sarcastic, and didn't like her demeanor... Especially when she told another customer 'Thank you for being so very patient while waiting'. Who does this condescending, snot nose kid think she is? She doesn't need to be dealing with people with that attitude. She needs to conduct herself way better.<//text>

Not bad for a dollar store. Neat and clean in the city of Oxnard. Safe enough area. Because of covid-19 issues they were out of some normal things like the white and red triple aaa batteries which have more than the panasonic ones that was offered and cooking oil. But the employees were pleasant and even though one customer guy was obviously having some mental health issues carrying on a full conversation with a non existent person, they handled him very well. So all in all a decent experience for a dollar tree or any dollar store.</text>

The store And merchandise are fine. The staff needs some serious attitude change.
I purchased a CART FULL of merchandise for my work with seniors- $155. When I asked the clerk if I could use one of the carts without the pole to take all my things to the car...he first said they didn’t have any. When I pointed to the 5 carts in the row that are without the pole that prohibits cart from going out the door. He said his manager  wouldn’t let the carts go outside. I said then ask the manager - he answered that he is the assistant manager but still wouldn’t let me take a cart to get two boxes  of glass vases and atleast 5-6 full bags of heavy toiletries.  The only other employee there told me mam there is a reason the carts have those poles. And I said there’s also a reason that there are some without
I purchased $150 worth of product at ventura store two weeks ago- and not only did the manager get me the cart wothout  pole she had someone help me load it into the car.

Bad customer service in oxnard. Sadly typical employees who can’t think on their own- even the “assistant manager” of the store.

Will continue to shop at ventura store- never again in oxnard and it’s very close to my home- but I’ll drive to telephone road for employees with common sense.<//text>

I only went in there for a  couple of items I needed and I ended up buying almost $50 of other products that would have cost me over $200.00 at a regular store. I love this store.< /review>

Great place to go shopping for party supplies, such as utensils, cups, plates, etc. since everything in the store is a dollar or less.  They also sell beauty products, office supplies, food, toys, candy, greeting cards, and much more.  However, the quality of a lot of their items is horrible and not made to last, so don't expect much.  The store always seems to be disorganized with things everywhere, items on the floor, and boxes in the isles waiting to be placed on the shelves.<//text>

It's OK. Somewhat dirty and items not well organized.  Manager and staff are not friendly. I try to avoid going inside this store.  The 99 Cent Stores in Oxnard are much better places to shop.  Too bad - poor treatment leads to lower sales.  They don't get that.<//Review>

Some are flashing, like strobe lighting and letting him know that the lights flashing like they are could cause people with seizure problems to have seizures. He said he didn't know that and would get them fixed. Well it's been two months and nothing.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>Cheap Vietnamese beef noodles soup restaurant. Good food and fast service for your money. The servers are very friendly and courtious. They have all day 50% discount on the beef noodle soup. The restaurant is open from 6:00am to 9:00pm, seven days week, 356 days a year. They are never closed.

When you are in the area, stop-by and try the Vietnamese beef noodle soup, it's very delicious.<//Text><user_name>THE DUKE OF THE WORLD (THE HUMAN MECHANICS)</user_name></record>

Safe parking. Real fresh food. Real chicken light or dark meat much better than sliced sandwich meat. Fresh juice was nice. Big window view very cool. Real nice guy service. Bring cash. Vietnam, Latinos, and white people's...eat here close to Starbucks and a Vietnamese grocery store. Nail care for women men and kids right nextdoor. Interesting place.  I am happy with my Pho being so fresh. Side of fish sauce with ginger. Yummy for my tummy.</review>

A nice place for your daily fix of Pho. It is affordable, fast service, and large space. The taste is not to extraordinary but it is not too shabby either. Perfect for a quick grab with friends.< /review>

The pho here is just ok to be honest, I eat here often. The broth usually comes out as lukewarm. But the rice dishes are really good. The pork chop with eggs or the fried chicken and rice are really good. The service is what was to be expected.</text>

Worst place ever this company does not appreciate the employees, the owner an manager only care about filling up there pockets with money. this company hires anybody even people who have felonys an aren't responsible. the work place is poor not enough ventilations for all the forklifts that are around, and drivers are very reckless. this place does not know how to run things smoothly at all and its really far from improving<//review>

<review>They tell me the load is ready, it just needs to be relocated from the port container into my trailer. It turns out that they left out a "small" detail, that they also had to palletize the load, and wrap. They palletized  28 pallets, each pallet contained a sum of 200 small boxes. I was told this when it was too late to find another load, as it was 3pm on a Friday. So I had to wait there until 2:30am. The warehouse hours are until 1am on Fridays, but clearly the loaders did not mind the overtime, as they took their sweet time to load. This was my second and the better experience there in two years. Avoid them if you can, and if you can't, I feel your pain.< /review><user>105567422578771163059< /user>< rating>

<text>(Translated by Google) Chinese drivers should not come. 15:22 enter the door. After arriving at the warehouse, I waited more than half an hour to check in. The goods were not loaded until 10 o'clock. Two trucks that arrived later than me and my unloading address. The same appointment time. The same unloading time. They left several hours before me. Bad Thanksgiving! Black Friday!

华人司机不要过来。15:22进门。到仓库后等了半个多小时才给check in。一直到10点才给装好货。比我晚到的两个卡车和我一个卸货地址。同样的预约时间。同样的卸货时间。他们比我早走好几个小时。糟糕的感恩节！黑色星期五！</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

My experience was great, sherry I believe was the staff members name she preformed exceptional work ethics and customer service. Her office was clean and organized along with the storage facility itself and her vibe was welcoming and knowledgeable about any question you may ask.She even went as far as describing how the owner whom had kidney cancer donated money to this foundation for cure research and although he lost his battle they still continue to raise money, she was very persuasive and managed to get a $30 donation from me.  Lastly, she followed up upon me loading up my new unit to ensure I was satiated and didn’t have any further questions that arose.<//Text>

<review>I’m so grateful to have found US Storage Center after a horrible experience at another storage facility in town. Not only is it clean, secure, and close to where I live, the manager, Sherry, is the kindest most wonderful person I could’ve hoped to encounter during my transition process from the other facility. She made the whole transaction quick, easy, and comfortable and I feel so much safer knowing that my belongings are under her watch at USSC. Thank you again for everything, Sherry!< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

They made everything super simple for me and made the process super easy and convenient! The facility is well kept and spacious! I also love the location of this place, it’s hidden and feels safer than out in the open! They made sure to address any questions or concerns that I had. I definitely would pick this place over any other storage!<//review>< Pictures>

Sherry was beyond helpful in getting us a storage unit on short notice. We needed a storage last minute and couldn’t find one available. She was able to recommend us a size based on what we wanted to store and we looked at it upon arrival and it was just the size we needed. She was so kind and sweet and patient with us. We need more people like Sherry. Thank you Sherry!< /review>

I loved everything about this company. Great customer service- Alley and Sherry, the property manager were very friendly, experienced, professional and helpful. They made everything so easy from the moment I walked in to the office. We didn't waste anytime. The property is well managed. I was amazed how clean the entire property is, literally everywhere! I also loved about the alarmed system for each unit. I feel very safe for the stuff I'm storing. It was a very pleasant experience overall. I'll definitely recommend this company to other people. Thank you!<//Review>

This being my first storage unit rental I spent a good amount of time checking out many of the local storage facilities and found that US Storage Centers in Simi Valley appeared to be the best. I was working out of the area at the time when I called both Sherry and Aly to see what type of unit that I would likely need, and to also ask a number of questions about the facility and how secure it was. They were extremely helpful and accommodating on the phone in answering my questions, and ending up making me feel like I had definitely made the right choice.

When I finally moved into the area and showed up in person, I was very pleased to see how well kept the facility is and the solid security features in place. Aly is absolutely fantastic, and did a superb job of showing me the type unit that would work best for me. She was also extremely patient and helpful in going over the month-to-month agreement and other rental policies. Sherry, the facility manager is equally remarkable and helped with my questions to ensure that their storage units would be the right fit. I am extremely happy with the level of service from such a great and caring staff, and I highly recommend US Storage Centers Simi Valley!</review>

Hit a tough life moment with a sad breakup during the pandemic and  I needed storage.  I wasn't looking forward to the inconvenience setting it up and moving my stuff.  Sherry at US Storage changed my perspective and got me set up so nicely.  This is my 3rd locker and this is the best facility by far!  It's clean, the price is fair, plenty of dollys, good hours, folks live on site giving a little more sense of security, and most importantly they got the smoothest R&B Jams playing in the storage halls.  :)< /review>

This is absolutely the BEST Storage business I have ever had the pleasure of storing our personal items. Clean, Secure and also provide the use of a 16 ft. Moving Truck to move your belongings free of charge!
John is a great guy and is always a pleasure to talk to when I go to pay my bill, I always look forward to the visit. He always goes out of his way to make you feel comfortable and is always very accommodating. He gave me the grand tour and showed me the units they had available and set everything up very professionally in order to get us moved into a unit. Thanks John!
Sherry is a great manager also and a pleasure to work with, Thank you both again for being great people and being very professional at what you do.< /text>

The Us Storage in Simi Valley is Prestigious, I called on short notice and Sherry took care of me, Clean lockers no leaks, Clean facility, Right of the main street easy to pull in, warm waiting room, It was raining at this time she loaned me an umbrella to get back and forth from the lockers which was sweet. Also, They sell locks there so need need to bring your own if you cant find them. They have enough room for little closets or vehicle space. Highly recommend this facility, process was a breeze and competitive pricing!</text>

We had a great experience. Went in late on a Saturday afternoon and spoke to John. He helped us find the appropriate size unit, gave us a tour, helped us find a great deal in a good location on the property. He took it one step further by asking us of we were going to start moving in today or tomorrow. I confirmed the next day, so he reserved the unit for me and had everything to go the next morning when I walked in, and helped me save a couple of bucks in the process. We were very happy.
The property is well maintained, clean and have not seen any sketchy individuals around.<//text>

To US Storage,
Sherrie is such a blessing, last month I thought I paid my rent on time and thinking I was in the clear but that wasn’t the case, when I saw Sherrie walking the premises and at time Sherrie reminded me about my rent being due and that I was days away from a late fee. Long story short I Paid my rent on time and I didn’t have to pay a fee. I believe Sherrie goes out of her
way to make sure that everyone in the complex is well taken care of. Sherrie you’re a ROCK star

Thank you

I always know when I show up to pay or If I have any questions Sherrie is always there to Greet me with a smile. Sherrie is definitely an asset to the company and I have nothing but kind words to say about Sherrie. Great employee!

Last month I was in a bind moving some of my things and I wasn’t sure  what to do, I asked Sherrie for some input and Sherrie came to the rescue yet again. Thank you Sherrie for all that you do not just with myself but I see how you treat everyone with class and respect. Thank you for being you!

Thank you

To whom it may concern,
This morning I was I a bind moving things in & out of my unit and I had know one to call when again Sherrie popped her little head out and asked if I needed a had, thank the lord she had someone there in 10 minutes to help me with my things. I’m not sure if anyone reads these comments but Sherrie is a blessing to US storage and the customers with who she deals with.

Thank you
Happy Easter

To US storage family,
The staff at your facility in Simi Valley is amazing it’s a very friendly atmosphere, they are so patient with me and I notice it with everyone they speck with and I believe it comes from the top “meaning Sherrie”. Sherrie always greets me with a smile and courtesy. In my mind I think US storage in Simi Valley is by far the best storage facility around!!!!
Thank you<//Text>

<review>We had a great experience working with Sherry.  She was attentive to the details, very easy to work with, helpful and extremely knowledgeable.  The 50% off 1st month rent and free move in truck were great perks!  Sherry really made the experience very positive for us, despite the stressful move.  Highly recommend renting from this company and Sherry!<//review></record>

<rating>5</rating><text>Sherry was a Godsend tonight when I came in right at closing and asked her to please let me have a unit tonight . She selflessly agreed and helped me rent a unit to store my packed to the brim vehicle so I could drive safely and feel safe and comfortable in my car even though she had an appt for her self right after work she chose to sacrifice her needs and put me first and I am extremely grateful for people and customer service reps like sherry because its rare these days to find such genuinely selfless help and support like sherry had given me tonight.</text><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80e828d7aa73b1cf:0x8d0308361d6483f1<//GmapID>< Date>

Great experience working with John.  He is very helpful and caring of what is needed to support you storage needs.  Very easy to work with and will help you find a storage unit that fits your budget and space needs.  Super friendly and made my move super easy. Plus the use of a truck helps big time!

<text>sherry is an amazing person and her customer service/manager skills top the charts, sherry and her whole crew really care about their customers.

I am very happy that I was referred to US Storage Centers by 2 very nice gentlemen.  I love this place, prices are very reasonable.  When you rent a unit, you get to use the free move in truck.  Awesome people that work in the office, Sherry, John, and Guillermo.  Thanks for the Excellent service.< /text>

<review>High marks for US Storage Centers!   Moving and storage is a stressful experience both Sherry and John helped ease the stress by give us great customer service.  I am helping my mom with her move she was able to get a unit and an additional unit as well.  The prices and best of all the security provided by US Storage Centers is top notch.  The combination of old fashion customer service and professionalism is hard to find these days, but you can count on US Storage Centers.  Sherry and John took the extra mile in accommodating our needs.  The use of the truck provided by US Storage Centers is a huge plus one stop shopping.  Again great service, value and convenience only US Storage Centers can provide is hard to beat.  I will definitely use their services for my move as well.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Name>Karen Sherwin<//Name><date>1568931943359</date><Rating>5</Rating><review>The senior manager, Sherry, is very friendly and accomdating.  She took us to see a number of different options at the facility.  US Storage had the best pricing out of the six different facilities we went to.  US Storage is the only facility that has the longest times that you can access your storage unit -- from 6 AM to 9 PM 365 days, they're open on holidays.  US Storage also offered us a 16' moving van to move our stuff into storage.
No other site did that.  A couple of the facilities didn't even have the regular manager at the site and the replacement people didn't know what storage sizes were available and the costs of the different storage units.<//review>< Pics>

Amazing staff !!! I had a storage unite for 3 years and was constantly putting things in and taking things out. The facility was always clean and maintained. The staff always had great customer service and when I was done using the storage unite It was so easy to close out my account and turn over the unite .. I have had many storage unites over the years from moving around with the military and this place was by far the easiest. The manager Sherry really cares about the customers and makes it a pleasant experience. I would recommend this place over all the other self storage places.</text>

I went in to get a unit the other day and I had such a great experience. Sherry was amazing!!! It was such a quick process. I was in and out. She really hooked me up. If you ever need storage please look to US Storage Centers. You won’t regret it. What a lovely woman.<//Review>

Went in to inquire about storage, I met the nicest people. Guillermo showed me around, different size units, explained in detail how the truck is used, by renting a unit, the truck is free.  He also introduced me to Sherry.  Had a very pleasant visit.  I will be coming back next month to rent the unit.< /review>

<text>Well, what can I say except I have already recommended US Storage in Simi Valley to several friends.  I am very impressed overall with my experience.  The staff has been awesome and has bent over backwards to help in anyway they could. It is always clean as well.  I love the fact that they have a charity for donations and have already given some items and look forward to giving more.  No comparison to other places!!

Sherri is amazing at her job and an asset to this company as 50% of the reason I stay with US Storage is she genuinely cares about the people you do business,  giving it a touch that is missing with most places who could care less about you or your family.   I always have a warm kind experience with her.  Thank You Sherri< /Text>

I've never had a better experience with renting from a storage place like US Storage! Sherry was not only professional, but showed she really cares about the people who come in. After telling her about our situation, she not only showed compassion but she truly helped us out any way possible in helping us decide what we needed when it came to the right storage size that we needed. I definitely would recommend anyone to go and talk to Sherry if your not sure on the size of storage needed. She was extremely helpful and a blessing in disguise! The place is so nice, clean and much cooler than others I've been to. Definitely worth 5 stars!< /review>

<review>Sherry in management has always been on top or her job. She has always been very nice to me as a customer.
And really takes her job seriously.
I appreciate people like her in the storage family.
Very few women like her around.

<Review>After researching online and visiting most of the storage facilities in Simi Valley, I finally discovered US Storage Centers and what a find!! Not only did the Manager Sherrie find the best possible size to fit my needs, she was so easy to work with and really nice!  This storage place is so much cleaner that any other I've been to and in the long run, the prices are better, too!!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Two words.. PHENOMENAL SERVICE!! There are so many wonderful things I could say about this place but a few words that come to mind would be, their storage units are top notch secured, the employees are incredibly helpful! Pamela is all smiles the moment you walk in the door, greets you in a sweet and professional manner. You really feel welcomed! If you're looking for the best storage service out there then this is the place to go!!! :)</text>< Date>

was visiting US Storage one day with my friend that had a unit there. I was so impressed with the property, the layout and that it was SO clean. I gave notice at my presents storage facility that very day and moved into U.S. Storage the following week! I am a very pleased customer.  I love the facility and the girls in the office are the best. They are extremely helpful and caring.Us Storage in Simi Valley is still number 1. I would definitely refer them to my friends!<//Text>

<Text>I wanted to give a thumbs up for the continued  - fantastic service to the Simi Valley US storage facility manager (Sheri) and the great staff on hand there. She is always so very helpful and has such a professional presence. I wouldn't ever consider moving from that facility, it's always clean and professionally landscaped. It is managed so professionally and its a very nice place. I feel that my stored articles are well looked after 24 hours a day.. Thank you Sheri and Pam!!</Text><username>John Ingersoll<//username>< Pictures>

I have to say that this place gives me a re-assuring feeling of security for storing my things. When I go onsite I always notice the security cameras and feel safe doing my business. And when I leave the site, I look at the security cameras again and  feel re-assured that my things will be safe. Sherry, the site manager is very personable and will go the extra mile to help you. She takes the time to understand your concern. You never feel 'rushed' when dealing with her. Thank you Sherry. You are a real asset to your company. I do recommend this place for storing your things.</Text>

<review>After receiving an “introductory rate” for 3 months and then having the space rent go up to $105 per month for 3 months, we get a notice stating that our rent will be going up again to $116 a month! So a $30 a month increase in 6 months??? For a tiny 5x6 space! Was there even really a “deal” in the first place? Seems exhorbitant... It’s more the point than the money. I could understand if my year contract was up but it’s barely been 6 months. Sad that rates are jacked up so much and so quickly at the whim of other going rates. I’ll be looking for a less expensive alternative first chance I get.</review>< Resp>

I just rented a unit from Sherrie and it was by far the best customer service I’ve had in quite sometime, I used to rent at public storage and I was recommend but another renter to come to US Storage and I am so happy I did. Sherrie made my experience a joy and I will definitely refer others to the facility at US storage.
Sherrie you rock!!!!</text>

<Review>Location is pretty good. The facility grounds are excellent. Sherry, the manager, is very nice. She will work with you on move-in and is a big help with your storage needs. Having someone on property 24/7 makes a difference. Probably, the best storage in the Simi/Camarillo/TO area.

I couldn't be happier with my experience for the last 7 years. This place is great in every way from storage to the management to the staff. I really appreciate their effort of keeping the place clean and secure.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80e828d7aa73b1cf:0x8d0308361d6483f1<//gmap_id><Date>1553905567629< /Date><user_name>Queen E</user_name>< Rating>

The office staff is the best I have found anywhere. Sherry and Pam are very friendly, professional and helpful. They are always available and willing to help out where ever they can. The complex is always clean and secure. I have referred several people and will continue to do so.<//Review></record>

<Text>The store manager, Sherry, is amazing! They have great customer service and are very responsive when you call to ask any questions. I would recommend this facility to everyone looking for a storage unit. The storage units are very clean  and I never have to worry about security issues since there are cameras everywhere and there is always someone on site during business hours.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Sheri is always been bright and cheerful whenever I have had to go into the office. Sheri has been very helpful for anything I've needed.
The Marine Corps League as been a customer for years and would like thank Sheri and U S Storage, Simi Valley for their support of The Marine Corps League.
I would recommend U S Storage to anyone who would need storage, its keep clean and has good security.</Review>

I moved into the storage in 2012 where I first met Sherry.  I moved out in 2013, moved back in 2015, moved out in 2016, and now I am back again.  I would not rent anywhere else.  I love Sherry.  She is the best.</Review>

US Storage Center on Royal Ave. In Simi Valley, Ca is the BEST storage facility I've dealt with. Friendly and helpful staff, clean and secure facility. Customer satisfaction is 110%! I referred a friend and I received 50% off next months rent. My girlfriend can't stop thanking me.<//review>

<Text>US Storage Center in Simi Valley is a Great place to storage your belongings. Short or long term. You knock out 2 birds with one stone because they also rent you a moving van for a small fee which makes your move that much easier. The facility is safe and secureand you can rest comfortably know your belongings are safe. Thank you Sherry at the front desk for all your help, my family and I greatly appreciate your great service and your genuinely caring about your customers.<//Text>< Pictures>

I came to US Storage because my son had used them and thought they were so much better than other storage facilities in the area he had used. The units are clean as is the outside area. I also feel that my "stuff" is very safe...Customer Service is very friendly and very helpful and seem to know everyone by name! Thank You... US Storage for taking care of my all important "stuff"!< /text>

Sherry has been so wonderful and kind. She answered all of my questions about moving into our unit with confidence. Everything is very clean and I am very glad my husband and I picked US Storge Centers in Simi to keep our belongings safe.< /Review>

<text>I would recommend the U.S storage facility on Royal ave. in Simi Valley to anybody I know. The staff is always friendly and the manager Sherry is phenomenal. She has always helped me with any issues that I've had and takes a hands on approach when doing so. Keep up the good work.

<review>This place is FANTASTIC! The grounds manager Sherry is such a blessing! I went in, in hopes for a small unit to fit my mattress and a few boxes and ended up buying a larger unit to accommodate more items I forgot I had! Thanks US Storage! You guys rock!!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

We have been very happy with US Storage Centers,  Simi Valley.... The place is clean, the staff is very helpful and they work with you if you need help with almost anything.  Sherry, the manager is extremely helpful with various ways that US Storage Centers can be of assistance to a client.

Thanks Sherry for help once again!< /review>

I have had a great experience every time I go into my unit.  Sherry and Pamela are first class managers and are always in a great mood. From the first time putting my things in storage, I was not in the best of moods about moving, but Sherry was there greeting me at unit and actually turned my unhappy attitude into smile and laughter with her personality... Thanks ladies for making it not just about business and taking the time to care!!< /review>

I've been a long time customer with US Storage in Simi Valley. Sherry Ladd the property manager and her staff has always been very professional and courteous. I currently reside outside of California, so knowing that my personal belongings and valuables that are in storage under a very secure area gives me great comfort. I would highly recommend them.< /review>

Your staff is right on the ball, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful at all times. The facility is always clean and neat and I happily recommend you use them for all your storage needs.

I have rented the other storages in Simi but they fail in comparison to US Storage - especially cleanliness and structurally. The office staff, Sherry and Pamela are very personable and accommodating. They are so nice, I have to stop in the office and say hi every time I visit my storage.</review>

Over the years I have always had storage units all over . I previously rented a storage unit sight unseen  from Public Storage. As soon as I entered the facility I was very uncomfortable with everything that I saw. I asked for my payment back which they gladly returned the deposit and first months rent . I stumbled on U.S Storage, the facility was so nice and secure I had no apprehensions with storing my belongings here.  From the second I walked into the door I was greeted with  professionalism and patients. I was so relieved  to find this place. All of the staff is very helpful and friendly . I don't ever have too feel like my belonging are unsafe. I would recommend this facility .<//text>

<text>I was in storage hell then I stopped by US Storage on Royal Ave. in Simi Valley,,,,, Sherry Ladd won my vote within minutes and I was sold on the place that I will store my belongings. She has a very positive attitude and the personal approach that I had been looking for but did not see at other storage locations. She needs to be commended for her attention to the details and how she knows her property...... Please do post this others need to know.
Now that I am days away from my move in all is still awesome.........
Thanks to Sherry my Storage Hell is over.....< /text>< Pictures>

I accompanied my brother to his storage unit quite a few times before we moved to Pennsylvania. Everything was always clean and in order, not to mention the lady behind the desk, Pamela, was always very thoughtful and well mannered with a sunny disposition. Though we no longer live in California, he and I have recommended US Storage Simi Valley to whomever we know that still does.<//Text>

<text>U S Storage Center is a clean and well maintained facility. Carts at every entrance make it easy to take items to and from your storage unit. The staff, especially Senior Property Manager Sherry DeGrand, are very friendly, helpful, and address your every storage need.</text></record></dataset><record>

Pamela and sherry were very accommodating. Definitely will refer the storage to my friends. Storage is clean and even provides the truck when you're moving in!<//text>

I have used US Storage Centers in Simi for several years. I have off and on, tried other storage companies which turned out to be more expensive, with less convenient hours, or farther away. One unit I almost rented at a competitor was less expensive, but I could see through the plaster wall into the hallway and outside. Someone could have easily broken into the unit. So, I keep coming back to US Storage for my occasional needs. I know many of the staff by first name and am very happy with how I am treated as a loyal customer. Thank you US Storage!</text>

< Review>
My family and I have been long time renters at US STORAGE CENTER on Royal Ave. for. very long time. Since our stay with your company we have had a lot less stress in our house knowing we are and have been well taken care of thanks to your manager and her staff. Let me go on record stating that without Sheri Ladd and Pamela our lives would not be the same. They have and do go beyond the call of duty to make sure their guests are satisfied and taken care of lessening the stress in people's lives who are there for so many reasons. Thank you Sheri and Pam for making our family less stressed at a time when you need a friend and you're always there too lend a hand.  I would highly recommend,  and I am experienced in storage, US Storage has been the cleanest and convenient place for us. The hours are always good and their always willing to help.  Again a HUGE THANK YOU from the Hanna-Bakers space B1057.</Review>

The Assistant Manager Gail is the rudest person I have ever encountered. Ever.

She actively insulted my group, calling us names, antagonizing us, and even made my girlfriend cry in the building. She did this while she was ON DUTY.

I recommend NO ONE should go here UNTIL GAIL IS PUNISHED FOR HER ACTIONS.< /text>

We have two units.  The staff has been extremely helpful in handling all our storage and packing needs.  When we have questions or concerns they are there to help and make things right.  We have rented storage units in other cities and none have lived up to the standards we have found in Simi at US Storage.</text>

Sherry and Pamela are the best women to deal with -- if you have a problem they will find a solution, all you have to do is ask.  I've been using their storage for two years and they are the best in Simi Valley!

I was referred to U. S. Storage by friends and at the time I came to rent space at your facility the management left a LOT to be desired.  I dreaded going in to make my monthly payments.

Thankfully, within three months of my using your facility, Sherry Ladd came to manage the store and she brought with her a totally fresh atmosphere of doing business with U. S. Storage.  She and her Staff has gone the extra mile to accommodate my needs.  The grounds are always well lite and clean.  The equipment is always available and in good working order.

I am writing this review because it affords me the opportunity to thank both she and Pamela for the wonderful job that they do; and I also wish for their Superiors to know that their efforts to efficiently manage this facility does not go unnoticed.

I have and will continue to recommend U. S. Storeage to others, and I encourage them to keep up the good work.

Sincerely,<//text>

<Text>The units and property are always so well taken care of - no trash or litter in sight!  This storage center is convenient and close to my home, but I got really lucky because the price was right and Sherry, the manager, is so caring and thoughtful, especially to us seniors, and that's a big plus!!!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80e828d7aa73b1cf:0x8d0308361d6483f1< /Gmap_id><username>L.

The staff, especially Sherry and Pamela, are friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and they are very civic-minded and do a lot of things to help charities, such as KURE-IT and FOR THE TROOPS.

<Name>BDP ROBINSON<//Name><Review>Renting at a storage facility can be a costly, solitary, impersonal experience. That couldn't further from the  truth at Simi's USSC!
The Manager, Sherry, creates, nurtures & maintains a uniquely atmosphere,  not just before, but after the contract is signed. Her business expertise is exemplary are self-evident. She will get to know you personally.  She celebrates successes, offers sympathy for losses. Sherry is approachable and accessible. More than just square feet on a computer screen, she knows the facility, literally by the unit &  will match you to a unit that best matches your needs. She are introduces customers to one an other, hosts get-togethers, encourages networking & creates community. She is why people stay, some more than a decade, others have multiple units. When they move, it is not uncommon for them to keep their unit  long distance or get another unit when they return.
Sherry is what makes the Simi USSC experience a true value!</Review><Rating>5<//Rating><user_id>117014457109724953980<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>The staff are outstanding! the facility is very clean. Never had a problem with the facility.
However the corporate end of US Storage is very annoying! I had a situation with my local US Storage and we worked it out quickly to everyone's satisfaction, but no corporate has to be involved and were sending me very annoying texts, back off bozo's and let the loacl staff take care of business, cause when you stepped in your image went downhill very fast. Shame on you!!!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80e828d7aa73b1cf:0x8d0308361d6483f1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

If it wasn't for Shari, I wouldn't have been a customer.   She made the experience so easy and flawless.  I was in a terrible situation and needed a place fast due to a bad break up.   She not only made it flawless, but listened to my rant.< /text>

IN SIMI VALLEY

Welcome to one of the Top, if not THEE Top Storages Centers in Simi Valley California!
You heard me right, This storage facility has been by far my best experience for the past 10 years!

Sherry (our manager), John (our assistant manager) & Geramo (our techincal maintance person), make up the best team players. They all interact with one another to perform an outstanding job. They really know what the meaning of "The Costumers always right" means.

They are open 6am to 9pm every day of the week. The office is open from 9am to 6pm. This place is always cheerfully friendly, clean to the max and always has us (the customers) in mind. The units are nice. Sherry always helps us if we need more storage or we need to downsize. Always the perfect fit. Thank you all for all your time and effort in making U. S. Storage Center in Simi Valley, CA the one for us.

<rating>5< /rating><review>If it weren't for the two ladies who work in the front office i would have taken my business else where a long time ago... The facility is in pristeen condition and is maintained impecably..The staff in particular is extremely cordial and very helpfull, even beyind the call of duty..They are the only reason that I have not left..My reasons for leaving (if i left) would be 1. The complete absence of restrooms..not only is it unbelievably inconveiniant, but very unhygenic due to the fact that people will improvise and urinate any where they see fit..2. The lack of garbage disposal makes it very difficult to keep things clean because you have to take your trash with you or leave it in your unit until it gets out of control and a problem to everyone...3.  The outrages late fees that are automaticalltly applied..20 % of the non discounted cost is not only a blatant swindle..but an insult to ones intelligence..I hope some big wig executive for the corporation reads this and gives the two ladies that work in the office...who are most likely under paid and unappreciated..a huge bucket of gratitude...Because if it wasn't for them...your place would be empty..what's wrong with you people? put in some toilets you cheap bastards!!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I Love US STORAGE in SImi Valley CA!!!!  I called a list of storage facility's in Moorpark and Thousand Oaks with no success.... my calls weren't answered or I was greeted with can you hold please.  So I decided to look in Simi Valley Ca.  When I called Simi Valley Sherri answered on the second ring and what a pleasant and product call it was. Sherri answered my questions...and gave, me an affordable quote. When I arrived at the facility, I liked how clean and secure it was, and loved the move in free truck bonus. I moved in easy and moved out easy.

I'm back in Moorpark needing storage.... So I called US Storage in SImi Valley and Sherri answered the phone again...  I'm moving back in on Wednesday!

Thank You US Storage

I just wanted to let Management know that they have an exceptional staff person named Sherry who is very professional and courteous. She is very knowledgeable and was so helpful. I have been looking for a new storage facility and after asking so many questions, Sherry was very patient and kind. I will be completing a contract soon. Thank you Sherry for helping to make my decision an easy one.</Review>

Sherry is the best! Always very helpful and outstanding customer service! She deserves the 5 stars 🌟 alone.. The company, not soo much.. they raised my rent 2xs in the last 8 months, which is ridiculous! Sherry tried her best to help but upper management did nothing to accommodate. I'm very sad that i will likely have to leave here soon after more then 5 years of being a customer due to this. Sherry deserves a promotion or raise, but this company is NOT the best bet. She is the ONLY reason i haven't left to date.< /Review>
