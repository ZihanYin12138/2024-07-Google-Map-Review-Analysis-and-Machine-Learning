The Concord showroom is a 10 if you want to find inspiration for room designs.  Great customer service, Alicia was super helpful.  Delivery was smooth and they set up everything and were patient about placement.  Really good quality goods for the money.<//review>

<Text>It was one of the fastest and simplest buying experiences in a long time. The family wanted a new/better support living room sofa. I explained my criteria and received a tour of the showroom floor. I chose  a handful of styles for which I was promptly given printouts and prices for my selections: these I handed over to my family who later made their selection and I called Scandinavian Design to place the order.< /Text>< Pictures>

Alicia was incredibly polite and extremely helpful. She didn't have to sell us the pieces we selected. It was a pleasure working with her.

The selections of furnishings were very clean, presentable, and well placed. We'll be back soon!< /Text>

Irina was my sales representative and it was a pleasure working with her. I decided to entirely change the style of my living and dining areas  and bought everything I needed exclusively from the Scandinavian Design at Concord. The end result is a very European, clean and airy look I strived for.< /text>

I was in need of a new Stressless chair because our old one had finally seen better days. When I walked into the Scandinavian Designs store, I was pleased to see every version of Stressless chairs, so I happily sat in all of them and found the chair that fitted me best. I ordered it that day, and received it a couple of months later. The person who helped me was Sarah, and she was very pleasant to work with. Great service, and a great chair!<//Review>

< Review>
I have only shopped at one Scandinavian Designs and that was the Concord,  CA. store. They have a great selection of furniture and very helpful sales staff. I was impressed at the variety. I bought a dining room table and chairs of exceptional quality for a reasonable price and their delivery and set up was seamless. I would definitely shop at any Scandinavian Designs store again.</Review>

My wife and I just moved back to California after 40 years, and we had to refurnish our new home with different furniture than the heavy oak country furniture we left behind.  Scandinavian Design gave a great selection of modern, good looking, and functional furniture at reasonable prices.  Our sales person, Kitty, couldn't have been more helpful in helping us select items while maximizing promotional discounts.  On return visits, we go directly to her as our personal sales agent.< /text>

Furniture is nicely displayed at this location, and by far, has the best selection.  Sales representatives are constantly walking by to ensure product questions are answered.  Delivery was smooth!

<Review>I've just finished re-furnishing our house with Scandinavian Designs furniture (our old furniture went to our son's house in Tahoe). We have been customers of Scandinavian Designs for more than 20 years.
This current shopping process lasted about a month and included several visits to the store as well as several emails and telephone calls.
From the start we dealt with Irina Alexander (and the store manager Turi).
Irina was personable, knowledgeable and attentive--a true professional.  Nothing was too much trouble.  Our overall showroom experience with Scandinavian Designs, and Irina in particular, was first class.
We had two large orders--one delivered in the East Bay and the other delivered to Tahoe.  The firms Scandinavian Designs used for delivery were also extremely good--on time, with good communications about arrival windows.
If only all my shopping experiences were this good.
Thank you, Scandinavian Designs.< /Review>< Pics>

We went in to "look" and ended up purchasing a couple of desks, book cases and office chairs for our new home.  It was a seamless process!  They have great looking furniture at prices that are comparable to other furniture stores around.  We loved the sleek and simple "Scandinavian" design elements that you don't normally see.

The sales staff were helpful and answered a lot of our questions!  The delivery fees were very reasonable considering our new home was 90 miles away.  We will definitely look at coming back when we need new furniture!< /text>

<text>We’ve purchased many items over the years at Scandinavian Designs; recliners, couches, love seats, end tables. Always good quality, and always something we like in our price range. Customer service personnel are professional, personable and knowledgeable. They are never pushy, and there when you need them.
Our most recent purchase was a Dinex table, walnut. Fits so nicely in our dining room and the perfect size when expanded. Great!
Oh, and the warehouse guys are always helpful, friendly and efficient.
We might look other places for furniture, but always come back to Scandinavian Designs. Actually, lately we haven’t bothered going anywhere else.<//text>< pictures>

<text>I ordered 2 couches and 2 chairs and was extremely happy with the short delivery time as well as our salesperson Alicia.  We ended up having an issue with one of the chairs, a small rip in the leather, and I contacted the store and they took care of it right away by exchanging the chair with a new one within  a week.  Highly recommend the Concord Scandinavian Designs store!</text>< pictures>

Exceptional service from Nuri, the associate who helped me and my pregnant wife with our purchase. I’m not a new customer to Scandinavian design, I bought some previous furniture from them before. I highly recommend the store if you want a high quality furniture.< /Review>

< Review>
We had a really pleasant shopping experience during the Black Friday Sales event. Gary, the sales person was very patient and helpful. He allowed us to roam around the whole store and explore, while answering all of our questions in regards color schemes and pairings available. This is probably one of very few furniture/home furnishing stores where sales reps do not hover over your head and try to persuade you to make a purchase immediately. Needless to say, the furniture at Scandinavian Designs sells itself and once you try out some of the pieces you will want to own all of them. We selected a couple of electronically reclining couches for our new living room, as well as a media center, a full set of side tables, a rug and two giant oil paintings to tie it all together, as well as a dining table and 6 chair set. They should be delivered this week and we will update the review once delivery takes place and we have a chance to use and enjoy our new furniture. It's rare to find things on sale at Scandinavian Designs and we wanted to capitalize on the opportunity to own some really nice high end pieces. We will come back when we need to remodel the bedrooms as there were some very modern and appealing sets available, but our budget was already maxed out.</Review>

Just to be clear - everyone at Scandinavian Designs was awesome especially LIN (my sales person). This rating will change to 5 Stars once the issue with the delivery people who damaged my wall gets handled & this delivery team of 3 that delivered my furniture never shows up on my door or anyone elses. I hate having to knock the store for delivery issues BUT I spent over 12k there & delivery was part of the deal.<//review>

Very expensive for what you get. Most of the furniture was not even comfortable. If you like high end designer and trendy yes semi functional furniture then this place is for you. I found a very comfortable sectional couch with a nice chaise lounge for 1/3rd the cost and just as good if not better quality.</Text>

Not only was I the ONLY customer, there were 5 employees working. First, I did not get a getting by anyone. Second, none of the employees even bothered to look up from their computer screens. Third, after walking the entire floor, I had to approach an employee to purchase a sectional, who then referred me to another employee. And lastly, still no one came to greet or help me with a furniture purchase after 20 minutes! This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I left without making a purchase because no one would assist me. I am greatly disappointed in Scandinavian Designs - I will not recommend to others.</Review>< user>

<Name>Jason Enos<//Name><text>Quality of products- ZERO (the majority of furniture is beaten and battered)
Customer Service rating- ZERO (Lin quite obviously dislikes his job as well as the customers, I will expand more on this in a moment.

Purchased a painting. When we got it home we found that due to the packaging by Scandinavian Design all 4 corners were damaged beyond repair. We were told to come back for an exchange. We asked to look at the new painting before we took it home and it was in worse condition than the first one. Not to mention that the colors were completely different. The warehouse guys told us that they had just received a new shipment of paintings and that we should look in the showroom for a replacement. We found 2 painting and a mirror. We were told by Lin that we could not purchase the mirror and that we have to order the paintings! We explained our concerns regarding quality (or lack there of) and the inability of guaranteeing that the colors would be exactly the same. It's a painting not a print. How can you possibly purchase something that's going to be a focal point on your wall sight unseen? Not to mention the waisted time on our part driving back and forth with the trailer. He (Lin) absolutely refused to understand or care, nor did he do a good job of disguising his distain. So instead of purchasing 4 pieces of art we walked out. I will also add that the manager was lurking behind him during the entire exchange. Apparently conflict resolution, customer service or even a positive disposition are not needed when seeking employment with this company.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Huge selection of furnitures from home office, living room and bedroom. I like the sale/clearance section of the place. The price are ok on some of the product. So, don't forget the second floor because that is where the clearance stuff is at.<//review>

Been a minute since we've been there, last was a few years ago, they have some incredible bikes and a good shop from what I remember but the tattoo parlor above was probably our favorite part, great artists some incredible work. Plan to visit again in the next year or so if still around. Will of course rate again at that time.<//Text>

<review>Ron and Matt turned my stock Softail into the bike I envisioned. They helped refine that vision and then got my bike in n out in less than a week. Nothin like picking up your new custom on Friday w/ 7 hours of daylight left.
Time to start saving up for an older rake now !
Thanks fellas.</review>< rate>

<Review>This is a REAL motorcycle shop.
Simms has crack mechanic's.
They're a group of really sharp guys. They really know what they're doing out there.
I for one will continue to take my business to Simms!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x808f9184a2038f2f:0xd9d01c501b3be6d6<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Been a minute since we've been there, last was a few years ago, they have some incredible bikes and a good shop from what I remember but the tattoo parlor above was probably our favorite part, great artists some incredible work. Plan to visit again in the next year or so if still around. Will of course rate again at that time.< /Review>< username>

One piece brake line and clutch cable...I needed these item for my 18" handlebar install on my 2021 Road Glide.  Sold at half the cost of Harley Davidson . Simms had these items in stock, no waiting for orders to come.</review>

Could not belive what my sister went through at this Nail Place, first she showed a lady a pictute of what she wanted done and the lady said no problem she can what she wants,,,, well she did not do even remotely close to what she wanted and charged my sister extra for the design that she didnt even do....charged her $160.00 dollars for the worst nail job shes ever had, DO NOT GO THEIR WASTE YOUR MONEY THEY ARE LIARS!!!!!!</text>

I was hoping I had found a new nail place since I just moved here to Menifee. Unfortunately two nails completely fell off and 1 was lifted within the same week. I called to let them know and was asked to go back. I went back and I asked for someone else to fix them and I was given the same girl. 2 weeks letter I called to let them know they are lifting. She stated I’d go for fills I said no there’s nothing to fill they are lifting. Asked to speak to a manager and she stated she was the manager. I asked for the owners name and she wouldn’t give it to me. They are very unprofessional. I was honestly going to give them a second chance but I am not happy at all in how they are handling this. I paid in total $91 for a full set including the$10 tip I gave her.< /Text>< Pictures>

My first time here was 2 weeks ago and it was actually really great and I was surprised at how good she did my nails. Chi was the lady who did my full set with gel. She's really sweet and I am most definitely going back to see her again!! I'm a happy customer.<//text>

Got my toes painted in the French tip style. It came out horrible the lines were a mess. The paint started chipping before the event I was attending the following night. Then I got acrylics those came out  even worse! She cut my skin at the thumb and kept adding alcohol to clean nails causing me pain. She left a huge glob of under my nail. The French tips were all uneven and not clean. She kept blaming me for bumping my nails! She literally yelled at me at many points!  I've never had any issues anywhere else. Basically I won't be going back!</review>

never again, I went here because my other nail place (Lucky Star) was busy and it was so messy. They did take me right away, but the lady was rude, and when I asked for regular polish she got even more attitude. she didn't let the layers dry properly so the Polish was moving and you could see the layers of the Polish. disgusting.  they were dirty. Never again.<//text>

<review>I love Showoff.  They've taken care of so many of our trucks and every single time they are on time, professional, treat us with respect and I would not take my off road trucks anywhere else.  The leveling kit on my Yukon is perfect, the lift and bags on my duramax, the lift on the Tacoma.... they do it all and their work is immaculate.  Would give more stars if I could!</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>The guys at Showoff Motorsports were extremely professional, they squeezed me in to their busy schedule to get the new tires on my truck so I could make a trip to Montana for Thanksgiving. They were fast, courteous and went above and beyond for me.  I will be using them again in the future.</Text><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>Alex and his crew are great to work with and know the value of a customer. I just bought a new 2020 Ford F250 King Ranch Tremor from Erich at Haidlen Ford and wanted new tire, wheels, and leveling kit installed. I asked Erich who he would recommend and he told me about Alex. I told Erich to send over my truck before I take delivery of it.

They will go the extra mile to get what you are looking for and give you there honest opinion of what is best for you and your needs.

Weather your local, in state, or out of state like I am give Alex a call and get the great service I have received.</text>< pictures>

<Review>These guys are the best! Very, very, professional, clean shop, great inventory, and the best prices around! After many inquiries around Fresno/Clovis about having amp steps put on our truck we gave these guys a call, we drove from Clovis to have these guys install them and couldn't be happier, the steps look good the service was fantastic, and the price was excellent! Definitely going to Showoff again!ⁿ<//Review>< Pictures>

I was in need of a shop to help me fix the lift on my jeep and not only did they do that, they did what was best for my budget as well. They were all very polite and kept me updated. The work that was done was fantastic and I would highly recommend this shop. Will definitely be back when I'm ready to update my jeep again.< /review>

<review>I'll start by saying these guys are absolute, consummate professionals.This is a 5-star shop.
It all started when I bought a brand new 2500hd. I had a shop in the Sacramento area install a lift, and it wasn't what I envisioned for my vehicle. I then found Showoff - and needless to say, it's been a remarkable relationship ever since. I've taken my truck there several times since my first visit. You get best of both worlds - quality & value. Not to mention - the technical abilities of these guys, and attention to detail is astounding. In most cases, they know more about your vehicle than most dealership technicians. They treat your truck as if it was one of their own most prized possessions. I tip my hat to Billy, Alex, James & team. A great shop with a great crew.
I would not hesitate one minute to recommend these guys. Again, 5-star shop with a 5-star crew.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>A **BIG** thanks to Billy, Alex, James and crew!!!!
I'll start by saying I've been going to Show Off for many years now. I have developed a strong relationship with Billy and his team. Before discovering Show Off; I had taken my truck to a well-known outfit in the Sacramento area. Needless to say I wasn't completely pleased with the lift/ powder-coating and work that I had paid for. Not even ten months later - I was looking for a highly-skilled shop to remove the lift and get it re-done... the way i wanted it. I found Show Off.. and well... that's when things completely changed going forward. These guys are absolutely, hands-down, top-notch, among the BEST of the BEST.
Over the years, I've gotten suspension work done, accessories, multiple sets of tires, custom bumpers, wheels - even one-off custom work done to my truck. They have proven their work-ethic, value and quality in spades. They have an exceptional eye to detail and I never worry when I drop my truck off. I have more anxiety taking my truck to a dealership.
Work is always done with the utmost level of proficiency, care and detail. The work they crank out is bar-none, high-quality.
Furthermore, Billy and his team are recognized nationally for the work they do. They have relationships with ALL of the big vendors and manufacturers. Clearly, their reputation has been earned and not "given".   I have traveled from the Bay Area to *only* have them take a wrench to my beloved rig... I would not consider using anyone else.
If you have a vision - they can and WILL execute it perfectly. There is no job too large or too small for these guys. They do it all. From SEMA builds to the guys wanting a mild lift with a wheel and tire package. They offer a tremendous selection of products & services to fit anyone's needs and budget.
If you can dream it - they can build it. In fact, I've learned first-hand: These guys know more about truck dynamics, suspension & steering more than the dealer.
They offer custom powder coating and finishing as well. They can color match any piece of your truck. Lastly, they have a very wide selection of accessories from truck bed covers, headlight lenses, chrome pieces, and literally everything in-between.
They are tremendously courteous, solid communicators and have astonishing customer-service. Every time I've called or walked through the door, my experience has always been consistent. This is a business that takes pride in their work, has earned their reputation through dedication and customer service ... and it shows. The passion is on display... just stop-by and take a look.
They treat people honestly and fairly... and again, they have something for everyone. This shop is easy to get to, right off the 99 freeway in Modesto. Have a comfortable waiting room and really friendly staff. You feel welcomed. If you're considering getting anything done to your truck.. I'd recommend these guys in a heartbeat. I'd give them 10 stars if I could.
Give them a ring... Alex and James will make you feel right at home.<//Text><response>{'time': 1566944271291, 'text': 'Thank you so much for acknowledging the crew.

They do good work, and I've repeatedly had things powder coated by them, but with their recent price hikes, I think I'm going to start anodizing instead of powder coating. This is a great group of people,< /text>

<Review>Worst place ever.. Basically stole 900.00 from me . No lift ! Truck untouched and sat in the same parking spot for 4 days . Took 800.00 the same way from a good friend of mine . Difference is my friend paid cash but I have a paper trail. Will be reporting them to BBB and seeing Billy in court now that the holidays are over . Save yourselves the headache and pay a little more for TCS< /Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< Response>

Went in to pick up my online order and the staff didn’t acknowledge my existence for at least two minutes. Once the staff realized I was an actual customer and not a ghost, I let them know I’m here to pick up my order and they said they’ll get started on right away (20 minutes after placing my order online). The smoothies were relatively good (nothing amazing) but I’ll definitely not be returning due to nonexistent customer service.<//Text>

By far the best Crafters I've had in Los Angeles. The ice cream is a perfect concoction of Crafters , cream, sweet, and smooth. The man at the register was very helpful and informed on Crafters and the owner was very meticulous in preparing the ice cream and latte to perfection. I'm in awe.<//Text>

The cashier basically told me I didn't have any rewards available when I knew I did. So I politely asked him to check and he didn't so I didn't feel like going back and forthe and just put my card in to pay. Then after I'm charged he says oh you did have 240 rewards available.  Smh ummm you think. I'll stick to a different location next time.<//Text>

That Crafters soft serve was heavy/creamy but also light. I don't know it was just delicious. Probably the best Crafters soft serve I've ever had.</text>

Juice Crafters is the theme here, their soft serve ice cream is definitely one of the best. Be warned, my party and i arrived almost ten mins before opening and a line formed after us, also limited seating inside and outside of the place.< /review>

I found JuiceLand near the JW Marriott while I was in Austin for work. As a vegetarian that eats catered meals while traveling, it's often difficult to stay nourished. JuiceLand was my savior! A juice a day is exactly what I needed to stay healthy. Thanks, JuiceLand!<//review>

< Review>
Talk about rude and unprofessional. I had just purchased a juice and was putting my credit card away when I was all of a sudden covered in juice. The guy behind the counter lost control of his blender and juice flew all over the register and where customers were. The guy behind the counter was laughing and cleaning up - no apologies. I asked for a towel and one guy went and got one. They had gotten juice all over my shirt, pants AND HAIR. I had to go back to the office with a shirt and pants with stains all over it and hair that had juice in it. Utterly disgusting. The woman behind me had juice all over her poncho. There was juice all over the floor which mind you - none of them came out to clean up. Someone can slip and fall on that. I asked to see a manager and she came in. I told her what happened and she rudely declared that "it happens" and then said in a really snarky tone "do you want something free or something". I'm sorry but i'm covered in juice and have to go back to my office. I did not go over there that day with the goal of getting free stuff. I've never had a manager be so rude. I had to say no i wanted an apology for her to utter one rudely. I'll never go back and I've told my entire office about it who also won't be going back.< /Review>

<text>Juices there are amazing.  They have both on-the-spot and cold press juices and both are have great taste and variety of flavor.

I usually stop their to energize my day with the Devine Start juice before work and finish my day happy with an Acai bowl.

Great place</text>< Pics>

<review>Silver cup drink is my favorite here so far! A little pricey, but didn't expect it to be much less in that neighborhood.  From what I remember, it had coconut water, almond milk, kales, dates, and bananas.  The workers were really helpful in helping me choose a drink and answering all my questions.  They were also good in getting me in and out of there because I had meter parking haha I'm glad I don't work close to here or else I would be forking over some serious cash to this place!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I love coming to this place just for the smells! I am actually happy if there is a line when I show up so I have more time to enjoy the fruity aroma. Their acai bowls have stolen my heart. I didn't think I liked coconut until I had real coconut at this place. Such a refreshing treat on LA's many hot days.< /Review>< Pics>

Juice Crafters is a very solid juicer/smoothie bar although a bit expensive for the average consumer.  Drinks range usually well above $5 for the most part along with some food items like acai bowls.  They have things like ginger shots to healthy smoothies that are mindful of your body and energy for the day.

I usually like to get the muscle builder (a delicious protein smoothie) as my go to drink which costs about $8 to begin with.  They also have a stamp card which you can fill out to get a free drink after a certain amount of purchases.

Parking-wise, like everything in this area of Brentwood, there is limited street parking which will be tough to find during the daytime.  You may want to opt to park a bit further and walk to this area instead.< /review>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>(Translated by Google) I asked for an acai bowl on Door dash!
For the basic one,
✴︎ Add coconut chips and blueberries
✴︎ Granola changed from nuts to gluten-free

A little less than $ 20. It's in a big bowl.
Strawberries and blueberries are fresh and sweet, and bananas are chewy.
Acai has a natural sweetness and goes well with rumbling granola!

We ate it in the morning and afternoon.
It was a little expensive, but it was delicious ~ ❣️

(Original)
Door dash でアサイーボウルを頼みました！
ベーシックなものに、
✴︎ココナッツチップ、ブルーベリー追加
✴︎グラノーラはナッツからグルテンフリー変更

単体では20ドル弱。大きな器に入ってます。
イチゴもブルーベリーはフレッシュで甘いし、バナナはもちもち。
アサイーは自然な甘さで、ゴロゴロのグラノーラと合います！

朝昼で分けて食べました。
ちょっと高かったけど、美味しかった〜❣️< /text>< pictures>

I worked with Jaime Valdez, he was very helpful and open. He let me look through the vehicle with no rush or distractions. He made friendly conversation and let me take my time.
After looking over the vehicle I found the price I paid was a good deal. Both Michael and Jaime are straight forward and don't try to hide anything.
I am very happy with the experience.< /text>

Today I have finalized the deal with Michael. The purchasing process was very smooth and he was able to work with me when my bank wouldn’t. This was my first auto purchase and I was able to have it all done in one day.  The team here was very professional and I would recommend this dealership to anyone.<//Text>

We just bought a car from Michael and Mandi. Both of them were very helpful with our purchase. The car we picked was at our current economic level, and Michael was honest about the car's status. He told us about all the work that was put in the car, and the future work it will need. Honesty is what we were looking for, and we definitely got it. We were approved right away, and at a deal we could not deny. Thank you.< /text>

My son just bought his 1st car here. Micheal was excellent! He showed us all the cars within his budget and explained all the features of the cars clearly for us. He gave valuable insight on information about what insurance companies consider “sports car” which would cause a higher premium. We test drove the top two choices and he was able to work with my son to get a great deal. Micheal was friendly, personable, helpful and knowledgeable. Great experience and highly recommended!!!<//Review>

Michael and his team were great! My son was purchasing his first car and Michael helped him go through the tedious process that comes with car buying. As a mother, Michael made me feel comfortable with my son purchasing a vehicle. I would definitely recommend Michael and his lot to others.<//Text>

< Review>
Michael is a wonderful car professional.
I bought my Mercedes E 350. For a fair price.
Michael took extra time with me as I had been ill for months. And still using wheel chair. He helped he every step of the way
I highly recommend this place with 5 stars.
Jaime also helped and corresponded with me .
LOVE MY CAR. AND I LOVE ARCHANGEL MICHAEL AUTOGROUP! #1 IN MY BOOK

<text>This is my first online review ever, and who better to make it for than Michael! He was extraordinarily helpful in making sure I was getting the right vehicle for my needs and he addressed any questions I had with the proper information so I knew I was walking away as an informed and protected customer.  It was a pleasure meeting Michael and buying my new van from him. He’s a good person who I would go to again if I ever needed another car. Thanks for all the help!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Just picked up my Benz from Archangel Michael Auto Group! The service was straight forward, quick, and efficient, and with a low down payment. He was also able to keep the monthly payments within my specicific specified budget. Michael was a breath of fresh air compared to the dealership i just had come from prior that gave me a 3 day runaround on the lie that they were waiting on an answer from the finance company.  Michael had me two quotes within 30 minutes! Thank you Michael for taking the headache out of car buying! Looking for a great vehicle at affordable prices? See Michael at Archangel Michael Auto Group!!<//Review>

<text>Michael was an incredible resource to have, he was very open and honest about the pros/cons of his inventory and how his pricing works. He even came with me to the mechanic to prove the quality of his cars, I would highly recommend him & his store for anyone looking in the used car market</text>< Pictures>

I was having a really bad time trying to get back with great condition car due to a unfair and weird repo. Lucky I found AMAG, Mandi set me to speak with Michael the CEO of the dealer. Let me.tell you it took 2 days! 2 days and I got back on a new car!. I literaly upgraded my old charger for a newer one that had all this amazing features. Car Is in great shape and We are really happy. I really thank Michael and Mandi for working with me and did the impossible. I highly recomend this place. I drove from Victorville to Bloomington 50miles where the dealer is located and it was worth it!!! Auto dealers like this are hard to find and prices are great also. If you are new buyer or wants to upgrade or just wants other car this is the place to visit. You walk in and they are waiting for you. Yes ist a bussiness and is not all about sales, its them going that extra mile of effort to make the customer happy and help with needs.

<Text>Muji Santa Anita opened on January 12th, 2017. Muji makes unbranded high-quality stationary, home goods and other accessories.

Muji is a Japanese minimalistic-design centric store. The price point is higher l, but the quality and design is outstanding.

The layout of the store is fairly straightforward. As you walk in, stationary (Notebook and pens) and their humidifiers are in the first section. On the left side, there are some clothing. From there on, there are home accessories Suh as clocks and plates. Further inside are the cookware and cleaning accessories used in home.

Muji Santa Anita has a unique stamp station in which consumers can use cute stamps to personalize the notebooks they buy. (See Picture)

If you love minimalism and quality, this store is definitely worth a visit.</Text>< time>

A very unique store. Dedicated to all things Asian sourced, predominantly Japanese and Korean. All sorts of finds there. The only thing that keeps me from buying is the price is not on par with quality in my opinion. Most feel like temporary pleasures than items that will stand the test of time both in entertainment and quality.< /review>

Pretty good selection, although pretty light in the stationary/ other non clothing stuff. Staff were not very helpful or friendly. Very busy but the line went fast.<//text>

They have pretty much most of the cool stuff that you may find at a MUJI in Japan, though as per any store, the inventory is based on region and that regions market. This MUJI is big, and has a lot to look at and likely buy.<//Text>

They sell home goods, stationary, and clothes that are too small to fit a lot of people.

Their gimick is that they don't brand anything. Everything is in plain packaging and the designs are all very minimalist. The upside is that everything looks very modern and they fit in well with whatever decor you have. Quality is pretty high, and while I would say most of their products are a bit overpriced, they are worth the price. Most of their notebooks are very good for writing with fountain pens, which is great because they also sell a fountain pen.</review>

Great place!
Always go here
Never buy anything
This is one of those places I go into, look around for a bit, and then leave once the emptiness of my wallet forces me to get out.<//text>

<Review>This place is great....however, the parking is VERY tight there and someone has already hit my girlfriends car once. The shops are pretty nice and the Ramen from Slurpin Ramen is the BEST. Love coming here when I travel from atlanta< /Review><Time>1594350330143<//Time>< Pictures>

<review>I visited this mall yesterday, and I came to realize that it was excellent and wonderful. Their place was secured with nice and decent bodyguards, saleslady treated me so good, and the cashiers were polite and kind. It was the best day of my life. They have everything that I wanted and needed. I was jumping in so much happiness, knowing that I was in the right place to spend my money. All I could say was thank you so much!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I love this place and practically lived here as while staying in KTown. Perfect for quick pickup and some window shopping, I often finished my boba before getting home just a few blocks away.<//review>

When I have a craving for pho, I always go to Thank You Pho. The reason why I gave this place 4 stars, it is due to the fact, this place got rid of a lot of parking so that people could have a seat outside. DO not come here on peak hours. You will have only 2 choices. Circling around to find parking on the streets, or pay the valet to park your car.</Review>

Boba is so delicious, great as a treat especially on warm summer day. Anytime really is the perfect time for boba.< /review>

<review>I rarely post reviews for products online as I'm seldom impressed with a product enough to do so.  However, in this instance I feel compelled to shout this one from the rooftops!  I am the full time caregiver for my 64 spouse who I've been married to for 46 years.  She has Type II diabetes among other serious maladies, but her blood sugar drops dangerously low without warning, often in her sleep.  With the new Libre II device monitoring her levels in real time and sounding the alarm, we are able to promptly react before she goes into hypoglycemic shock.  Just as amazing is the predictive nature of the device that forecasts rising or falling trends of her lab values thus allowing us to adjust diet and other factors resulting using less insulin.  It is a game changer for us!  Finally, we are so grateful to Advanced Diabetes Supply for guiding us through the process of obtaining the device, coordinating medical records, insurance company requirements and keeping us posted every step of the way!  We dealt with a person by the name of Izzy who was professional, compassionate and kind. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  Please feel free to use any or all of this review.

ADS has been very helpful to me.  They call when info is needed to continue the service of my sensors, and help to make my experience with them very easy. Thank you ADS</Review>

<Text>Great place to get help with the incredibly high price of insulin and products for people with type 2 diabetes.  Helpful and kind staff they work with you to help get the things that you need. I recommended them to my mother in law. There are no hoops or gimmicks everything is very straightforward!! Thank you Advanced Diabetes Supply for helping my husband who is on disability when Medicare would not!!</Text>< Pictures>

My husbands prescription for a sensor did not get filled on time so I called Advanced Diabetes Supply to find out why.   The Dr 's office never faxed it in.   The Rep was so friendly and helpful.   She had one sent to us overnight delivery.   Thank You   You are the best</Review>

< Review>
Service has been excellent.  The phone people are responsive and do what they promise to do. I’ve been using them for nearly a year, and on only one occasion, was there a delay in getting back to me.  They answer all of my questions and never make me feel that I am bothering them, even if sometimes I am sure I must be.< /Review>

Absolutely terrible service. Not only is the phone wait time incredibly long, their suggested use of their voicemail takes no less than 24 hours and usually longer to get back to you.
I have been having an issue with my transmitter that (for some reason) was not sent with my sensor supplies. After 7 phone calls (and counting), I have still not received it. At each phone call, one issue is apparently addressed, but other issues are not. Then, I as the customer, have to continuously follow up to find out why I still haven't received my transmitter. Then another issue comes up that has to be addressed. Today my transmitter finally died so I'm back to finger sticks. I have been "guaranteed" that it was going to arrive several days ago, but still no transmitter. As a physician, my staff and I deal with various medical and medical supply companies, Advanced Diabetes Supply has been the worst experience I've had in 30+ years of practicing medicine. I spoke with my endocrinologist and she has stated that several of her other patients are having similar issues.</text>

{'time': 1622129908970, 'text': 'Greetings Pablo –\n\nFirstly, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with our service. We appreciate your feedback and we investigate every review thoroughly to enhance our customer service to meet our patient’s needs.\n\nFor your initial order with us on 04/09/21, we received a transferred prescription. Our representative confirmed your order to be shipped which you authorized only sensors to be sent because you did not need a receiver or transmitter at that time. On 05/05/21, you contacted us to ship a transmitter however the transferred prescription we received for your initial order had just expired.  We reached out to your provider to obtain a valid prescription and confirmed your order. Unfortunately, we made an error with calculating your copay causing a delay with your transmitter order.  Upon identifying our error, we expedited your order to ship next day and tracking confirms your order was delivered yesterday.\n\nYour next eligible order for sensors will be available on 07/08/21 and your transmitter order will be available on 11/22/21.  We are actively seeking to grow our staff to better assist with connecting to our patients quicker over the phone.  You may also email us at customercare@northcoastmed.com and we can reach back out to you after reviewing your account.  Again, we sincerely apologize for the delay and appreciate you choosing ADS for your testing needs.\n\nPlease reach out should you require anything additional.'}</Resp>

<Text>Since using the Freestyle Libre 2 from ADS, it has changed my blood sugar ups and downs. Went from 7.6 to 6.5. Can see where I am at at anytime and can adjust. ADS has made it super easy to get my supplies, and reordering is a breeze! So glad I am able to work with them.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Gmap_id>

This company lacks an ability to maintain records for refills on diabetic supplies and fails to ship in a timely manner with the claim that the insurance will not allow for processing shipments to ensure items are delivered.  Their hours of operation are limiting for folks who live in the Central or Eastern time zones.  So tired of having to chase down my husband's diabetic (CGM) supplies when promises have been made that they will be responsible for filling refills.</text>

When I couldn’t get my Free Libre supplies for a reasonable price , I searched the website (Free Libre) , and was directed to Advanced Diabetic. This source has been wonderful. Although I live across the country, they’ve sent my supplies on time every time... without my prompting. The savings in cost are the best! No complaints here!<//text>

When you do make contact with them, some are as rude as can be. If you get Emily to talk to you are very fortunate as she will go out of her way to help you. No communication back from them when leaving an email, so you have no idea if things are in the mail or not<//Review>

< Review>
I have only been with Advanced for approx. two (2) months and have received one (1) shipment of sensors, etc.---basically the starter kit.  I have also spoken to the pharmacist a few times and had a good experience with her; she seemed informed and knowledgeable. So, thus far, things have been copasetic and they aim to please.  One thing I must say is that the company should NOT outsource their phone-calls to places where English is not the primary language; it makes them harder to understand and which causes confusion and  lots of: "Can you repeat that please"  in a conversation.   Thank You,  Rev. Fr. Leonard Stark, ORC<//Review>

What everyone needs to do is complain to their MAIN insurance and state how horribly slow and how they don't answer the phone. Trying to get any resolution is nil to None! Somehow they have to be regulated in some way by a governing body. So need to file a complaint(s) to show how poor their service is. Companies can't survive on poor service. We need our supplies as it's usually life or death for most of us and they could one day be sued if they are found to be liable because of their poor service.< /text>

I have written 0 reviews ever. This company is horrible.

Dexcom recently switched their resupply provider over to this company. It has taken over two months for me to receive my products, and I am still waiting!!! They don't pick up phone calls, they don't return calls, they don't send out follow up emails.

If you are presented with the opportunity to work with ADS, say no and ask for an alternative.< /Text>

On hold for over 20 minutes, then they NEVER call back when you request the call back.  I was completely out of my sensors and again no call backs after 7-8 phone calls.  This is a HORRIBLE, unreliable supply company.  I would tell anyone that is considering using this company, STAY AWAY!  It is not like our supplies are optional, they are the difference between life and death.  I  have now switched back to Byram!  I will be contacting Dexcom & Tandem to let them know the kind of suppliers they are referring their patients to!</review>< rate>

<review>I can't even begin to express my frustration at the incompetence of ADS. Case in point: In January 2021, I called them to update our new insurance. Diabetes supplies were not due to be refilled until March, so this gave them plenty of time.

On March 2, 2021, they sent their form text asking for authorization to ship and charge the card on file. I authorized it.

On March 12, 2021, I received an email from ADS, asking for the exact same authorization. I gave it, and asked why they were emailing when they texted for the same authorization ten days earlier.

On March 23, 2021, I called ADS to find out what was going on, because supplies were about to run out. I had to wait on hold for over TWO HOURS before I finally got to speak to someone, and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with the order.

On March 24, 2021, they called me on the phone to say that they had run the insurance verification TO THE WRONG INSURANCE. Yes, they had the correct insurance on file from when I updated it back in January, but they didn't use that one; they used the previous insurance. So now they had to run a NEW insurance verification. They assured me they'd put a rush order on it, so it should be back within a couple of days. I gave my authorization at that time for them to immediately ship it, once the verification was back.

On April 15, 2021, they called me to say that the insurance verification JUST came back (???) but wouldn't authorize a 90-day supply, which we've had for over a year. They didn't offer to send one month's supply. They didn't offer anything. Just a phone number if I wanted to call them back.

I called back, waited on hold several minutes, and left a voice message. With their track record, it could be days or weeks before I hear from them again, and meanwhile diabetes supplies have run out.</review><pics>None<//pics><name>Sheyna Galyan<//name></record>

<Text>Very poor service. It takes forever to reach someone on the phone; they say they will call back and never do.  The personnel are very  pleasant when you speak with them but there is a huge disconnect then between ordering and receiving supplies at ADS. Seems like they need a total reorganization to gain some efficiency when they are dealing with such essential products<//Text>< Name>

<Text>I wish I could give negative stars because this is the worst place I have dealt with in ordering diabetic supplies. First off it took an entire month to receive my Dexcom G6 order, 2 weeks into that when I called them to see what's going on, they claimed they were waiting on my medical records, even though they never said they needed them. Took another 2 weeks before they finally processed the order. They told me I would get a 3 month supply of sensors, and even said the dollar amount it would be, but when it shipped the invoice only had one box of sensors (one month) and I was only charged for a one month supply. When I called them again they said there was an error on their end with the order, but they wouldn't let me get the other two months until the first month ran out, and they would contact me at the end of the first month. Of course the month came and went and heard crickets from them. When I called them about the next order they said it would be at least another 10 day wait before they could fill again, even though I was already out of sensors. Fortunately I've found a pharmacy locally to handle my Dexcom orders now, and not have to deal with this nightmare. Judging by many other recent reviews, I'm not the only one with problems with this place.  Avoid this place if at all possible, I can't imagine dealing with this with insulin pump supplies since those are more important.< /Text>< Pics>

VERY poor follow-through, VERY poor communication, VERY slow shipping of products. I understand that people are working remotely due to COVID, but if more than a year into the pandemic your business hasn't figured out how to communicate information even amongst co-workers in order to meet the needs of clients, the business is a failure. If you can find a covered supplier closer to home, I would recommend trying some place else.<//Review>

I have called three times on May 3. I followed their direction on the phone to hold my place in line and they would call back. Only time they called was at 12:33 and I was hung up on. I called right back and received the same message to press one and customer service would get back to me. No word from company so y called back and left a voice mail telling them I am not happy. I think people should contact their insurance.</Review>

Would rate this 0 if possible. Insurance authorization on file since 4/7 I have yet to hear from this mediocre company after multiple calls. Hold times are ridiculous and when someone answers they keep saying authorization needs to be verified, even after I told them I am out of sensors and transmiter. Working with my insurance now to get Dexcom supplies elsewhere since this company is a joke!<//Text>

< Review>
My daughter has been forced to transition to this vendor after being with Dexcom.  They never contacted me and I have gotten the run around from them for almost two months!  At first they needed an authorized, then a signed prescription, then a more clearly signed prescription, then my daughters medical chart notes, then a new letter with the number of sensors rather than days.  I have bent over backwards getting them everything they have continued to request and here we are two months into this and we still have NO Dexcom.  I keep calling and still have not received the equipment we need.  Worst experience ever!  Kid's shouldn't be forced to go without when we ha e insurance and have even offered to pay in advance.  It's RIDICULOUS!!</Review>

Absolute worst service I have experienced in trying to receive needed Dexcom supplies.  I do not understand how this company can continue to exist.  I have called 8 times during business hours, left countless voicemails and requested a call back.  Once they called and didn't even let the phone ring a full one ring before hanging up.  I had the phone right beside me so I would not miss their call.  I am now calling Dexcom and going to beg them for a transmitter.  This company should be out of business.<//text>

Then on my last day of the dexcom I drive an hour to my endo so they can call and get through some how and ADS ships to me 3 days later... But my dexcom already expired! ..... Hands down the worst company ever! Save yourself aggravation and fund another supplier<//text>< pics>

<rating>1</rating><Review>We have received dexcom supplies from this company for last 10 years, the last few years progressively worse service. At this point I need to review to warn those trying to decide what company to go with, AVOID this company if you have any other options. They do not follow through with obtaining auths, never give an update if order delayed, I have to call and harass every time we need an order filled to get them to work on it. Takes 45 mins on hold to get some clueless customer service agent to answer and tell me they are short staffed and "sorry looks like no one started the authorization" from 1 month ago!< /Review>< Pictures>

UPDATE: I ended up waiting 1:54:55 before speaking with someone in the Dexcom intake department. Unacceptable.

It is entirely unacceptable to wait on hold for 1:46:24 and counting to talk to the intake department! I am absolutely furious at how unprepared this company is to handle any Dexcom orders! Not having supplies literally endangers the lives of diabetics and this company can’t be bothered to staff their call center with enough people! I have better things to be doing other than waiting on hold for two hours or more!</text>

They never, ever answer the phone except for this one time that they did, but then they put me on hold again and the call disconnected. Left multiple messages, no callback. It’s like trying to call MCI Worldcom in the 90s. BBB next.<//Text>

< Review>
This company is really bad at sending prescription refills.  They will wait until the last possible day to send supplies and they just told me that it was their bad for not sending my refills after 90 days, and that they didn't even send communication to notify they weren't sending them automatically.   They pretty much suck.  Just avoid them<//Review>

**FINAL UPDATE**
At first, I was very unhappy with ADS customer service for the reasons below. However, ADS was extremely proactive in remedying the situation and now I am extremely satisfied. As soon as my insurance approved the authorization, ADS got my order ready and out the door. I believe that my initial experience was not representative of ADS as a whole and I applaud their customer service department for going above and beyond to make sure I could get my supplies as fast as possible.

**UPDATE**
So, I'm actually really impressed with ADS customer service! Less than one day after I posted the original review, a rep contacted me and helped me get everything sorted out. It turns out we do need some more paperwork (which I found a little frustrating, because I was told multiple times by multiple reps that they had all the paperwork necessary and all I had to do was wait), but hopefully that was the last of the miscommunication. They also apologized for the lack of communication on behalf of the company and even offered to overnight me some testing materials so that I can check my blood sugars in the meantime. This interaction makes me hopeful that my previous experience with ADS was not representative of their customer service. I don't like leaving bad reviews on yelp, but I think that a company that deals with life-saving medical supplies should be held to a higher standard than say, a coffee shop. I will update this review hopefully just one more time after everything works out and I actually get my G6 system!

I've been trying to get on the Dexcom G6 and my experience with Advanced Diabetes Supply has extremely been frustrating. The process of getting the supplies I need has been delayed multiple times because different reps keep giving me the wrong information. They even sent a text message that an authorization had been submitted, but when I called to check in, it actually had not been submitted. To their credit, every rep I spoke to has been very friendly. My experience is detailed below:

ADS: "We spoke with your doctor's office yesterday, we have all the paperwork, and everything looks good. We'll give you a call when things are ready."

Me: *calls to check in two weeks later*

ADS: "Actually, we need your doctor's office to send us a form so we can send it to your insurance. After we get that, it'll take about a week for your insurance to approve it."

Me: ??? then why did you tell me everything was good and have me wait two weeks for nothing??? *Has doctor submit necessary paperwork in less than one day. calls ADS to check in a week later."

ADS: "Yes, we have all the paperwork and we just have to submit an authorization to your insurance. I'll submit it now, check back in a few days."

**They actually sent me a text message which states that the authorization was submitted as urgent and everything should be approved in about a week.

Me: *calls back a few days later to check AGAIN*

ADS: "Your authorization hasn't been submitted.... Yes, I see that someone sent you that text message, but they didn't actually submit the authorization. I'll submit it now and everything should be ready in about a week."

Me: ??????? Your company literally sent me a text message that my authorization had been submitted as "URGENT" and that I would only have to wait another week. Now my process of waiting a week is starting over??

Extremely frustrating... will be calling back tomorrow to see if they actually submitted the authorization.< /Review>

They were good for the first three years getting supplies from them but this past year and a half they have become so frustrating and useless. I have to call them all the time to make sure my supplies are not delayed and they process insurance on time. If I left it up to them all my shipments would be delayed weeks or months and with a CGM, especially pregnant, that is NOT OKAY. That affects my health and my babies. Their laziness and lack of organization is not something that should affect my health. Each time I call i get told something else by a different person. I have had the same insurance, doctor, and prescription for almost five years now. The only thing that has gotten worse is them and how they handle their customers.</Text>

This company is absolutely terrible . My daughter is Type 1 diabetic and has a prescription for sensors. She has no symptoms of low blood sugars and has had several lows during the day and middle of the night that we would not have been aware of except for her sensors.We have a great doctors office and great insurance. We never have any issue getting supplies or prescriptions EXCEPT with this company. Do Not use this company if you need to have your diabetes supplies sent on time. I have tried to give them chance after chance for over a year with her supplies and it is ALWAYS something and my daughter ends up going without her supplies for days up to weeks at a time</text>

Wish I could give zero stars.  I ran out of transmitters and called for a new prescription.  I paid extra to overnight it.  They sent it ground.  It's been four days and counting that I've had no transmitters.  I called to complain and was told it's "out of their hands."  I asked to speak to a manager and was told that the leads were "in a meeting."  Very convenient.  I'm switching suppliers today.<//review>

I have been with ADS for over a year now for my son. They have always been easy to contact and expertly answer all of my questions. Recently Devin has gone above and beyond assisting with my current issue and has worked diligently to ensure the fastest processing possible and has kept me in the loop the entire time.<//text>

<Review>I would give them no starts if possible. the bad reviews here say it all, long call wait times, give you the run around each time you need new supplies asking for multiple verifications via email, text and call. Completely inefficient and painful to deal with as a customer. the worst experience i have with any company.< /Review>< pictures>

I have talked with a couple of customer service reps that are polite and very accommodating.
Most if the time I can't get through to anyone to answer my calls and then when my call is returned I miss the call because I am hard of hearing.  The fact I didn't answer my return calls was a complaint to me.  This person hadn't done any research on my account to see a problem before she began leaving a message and then she realized while leaving this message I had also sent an e-mail that  my order was late she said, " Oh I see the order is late.  I can send it out right away."
I'm happy she sent it out but it seems getting most of my orders is a hassle.  I would really like to know why in writing so if it is the doctors office I could have something to show them to let them know what the problem is.</text>

As a former employee and diabetic ~ I would leave a zero if I could. This diabetes supply company not only refused to accommodate my diabetes during the COVID-10 pandemic, THEIR DIABETIC EMPLOYEE AT THE DIABETIC SUPPLY PROVIDER, they failed to notify me they had gathered my things and 'lost' them irretrievably. Garbage place to work and questionable service from an insider perspective.< /review>

This disappointing, if not dismal, supplier has been slow in shipping my wife's supplies, I am the insurance holder, the past twelve months as well as very slow in communications, always a recorded telephone message that ask to leave a callback number or stay on Hold.  It was worst during this shelter-in-place period, when my wife called fives times, was disconnected four times before holding for 20 minutes whereupon she hung up in frustration.  She called a sixth time and used the company's callback option.  After a two hour wait, she inquired about her confirmed three month supply shipment that was scheduled to ship seven days earlier.  The company representative claimed that the company had lost its record of text orders (plural).  If true, then the company is irresponsible in not notifying my wife as these are important prescription products.  With great insurance and many choices, it's time to drop this dismal supplier, i.e. this company sucks.<//Review>

At first, they did a good job. They shipped out my diabetic sensors and I had them on time. After several orders, they began saying there was problems with my prescription from my doctor which was never the case. My doctor has sent in everything that was required from the start.. I seen it myself.
Then, my orders weren't on time... they used to call or text me telling me it was time to reorder and would even provide the tracking number.
Now, it's no orders and no communication.  I've tried sending emails, phone calls,  text messages and no response.
They were supposed to send out an order last month and still nothing.
Very very bad and poor customer service.
Will be filing a complaint with their states attorney general.< /text>

<Review>There needs to be an option for zero stars. This is an absolutely HORRIFIC company.  My son’s supplies were due to come in (late). It caused him to run out of sensors and his transmitter had expired. He was suffering from a weekend of scary lows so not having his supplies was extra dangerous. When I called they said their system was down they’d get back to me (they never did) in a couple days. We had no sensors or transmitters!!!!! Thankfully I called dexcom and they told me I could call my son’s endo and get an emergency refill through our pharmacy so I did. When I called ADS to see where our supplies were four days later they said they couldn’t fill the prescription because I got it filled somewhere else. WHAT???? I had to get it filled somewhere else because of THEIR negligence. Needless to say I yelled and eventually talked to a supervisor and his supplies are supposedly on the way. The gross negligence, apathy, and lack of urgency for providing life saving medical supplies is terrifying to say the least. I am asking my son’s endo to change our supplier our next appointment. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! They can care less about their customers.</Review>< Pictures>

If I could give this company zero stars, I would.. I don't even know where to start since Advanced Diabetes Supply has literally screwed up on so many fronts when it came to getting the proper pump supplies for my son. Now they refuse to field any phone calls or try to fix the issue. I would say they are on the borderline of being fraudulent at this point.<//Review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>I am shopping for a supplier for my Medtronic pump& Dexcom G6 CGM. I have had such bad customer service from suppliers that I HATE dealing with any & all suppliers. The problem is that Medtronics & Dexcom want to just concentrate on bettering their products, and they force us to use medical suppliers. PLEASE understand that if you would have great customer service, you could DOMINATE this business! All people want is good customer service! Read the complaints. They are the same that I have from other companies. SOMEONE IN THIS BUSINESS NEEDS TO STEP UP AND BE THE CHICK-FIL-A OF MEDICAL SUPPLY COMPANIES. Will it be you? Do you have the character, integrity and honesty to be the leader?  (I give you a 3 star because I do not want to hurt or help you since I am not a customer.)</review>< pics>

<text>I wish I could leave a no star review. Please please double think before going with them to receive your medical supplies. I have amazing insurance yet every 3 months when it came time to order my supplies they gave the run around each and every time. Asking for nonsense updates from doctor or insurance. My records were never updated despite me doing several follow ups. Do not go with with this company. I repeat DO NOT GO WITH THIS COMPANY unless you like waiting weeks, even months on end to receive your supplies.< /text><Rating>1<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x80dc749f6002c2b3:0xe3458b1592fae094<//Gmap_id>< user_name>

My son is T1D and receives his Dexcom Sensors from ADS. Not one order has came on time. We have duel insurance and not one order has gone thru the second insurance. They are supposed to be changed every ten days but they will only fill after a calendar month plus 5-7 shipping days! that's a whole week of no Dexcom! its beyond unacceptable! Its sad we have pharmacy benefits but thru Durable Medical Plan its cheaper and goes twords our deductible but companies like this have no care to the patients actual medical needs. I would not recommend to anyone.< /Text>

THE WORST COMPANY EVER TO DEAL WITH AS A PATIENT & AS A REPRESENTATIVE IN THE DOCTORS OFFICE. DO NOT USE THEM!!
THEY WANT NOTES SIGNED BY DOCTOR, THEY GET THEM (AT THREE DIFFERENT FAX NUMBERS), THEN THEY COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE THEY NEED, THAT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. THEY SAY THEY WANT A LETTER, SIGNED BY DOCTOR, YET STILL IT ISN'T ACCEPTABLE. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWFUL. IT'S DISGUSTING THAT THESE PATIENTS CAN'T GET THEIR DIABETES SUPPLY IN A TIMELY MANNER. THIS ONE PARTICULARLY FREESTYLE LIBRE. IT IS SUCH A SHAME. THEY NEED TO SHUT THIS COMPANY DOWN OR REVAMP WITH ALL NEW WORKERS AND MANAGEMENT. I WILL NEVER USE THEM, NOR ANYONE IN MY OFFICE WILL RECOMMEND THEM.<//Review>

<Text>Absolutely terrible experience and customer service.  To refill a prescription you have to work through an automated phone system.  The system asks for you to leave a message but the mailbox is full.  How can a company providing life saving supplies treat patients this way?

My son receives his CGM (Dexcom G6) through this company. We had a small hiccup in the beginning with the insurance communications but since it has been amazing! I just called to get another shipment and it was super easy!< /Review>

Too big to care about the individual patient. They have their way and it is their way or no way. Hold times over 20 minutes are common, and although offered, they don't call back. Sorry Google doesn't allow negative ratings.<//text>

<Review>Very frustrating company to deal with. I have to call multiple times to get receipts from copays, and deductibles. This time, the lady on the other end states I should have one more sensor from Dexcom, but in fact I am completely out. Now, I have to spend out of pocket for extras, purely because they don't have their dates correct. I was unable to speak with anyone "higher up". As a mother of a son with Type 1 DM, painful to go through this company to obtain his supplies.< /Review>< date>

This is the worst diabetic supply company ever.   Please take your business elsewhere.   I am a medical office manager and our office will not deal with this company.   They are incompetent and will lie to patients to cover for themselves.   The amount of paperwork they filled out is excessive and unnecessary.  Your fax will be lost, you will wait forever for supplies/ if you ever get them at all.  Medicare patients:   You have better options for supplies.  A grievance will be filed- ADS does not deserve a Medicare contract!!!!!!<//review>

They sent me an invoice charging me a grandiose amount for supplies from last year, which were completely covered by my insurance at the time. I've been trying to get a hold of them repeatedly through email and by phone to sort his out, and no one is answering. This is horrible customer service -- I'm hoping a negative review will finally grab their attention.</Review>

<text>very poor customer service.  I cannot get my supplies in a timely manner.  This has become a second job for me.  My phone calls and emails go unanswered.  I am completely fed up.

<review>Terrible experience getting prescription for Omnipods verified by ADS/Northcoast Medical Supply. My doctors office sent all necessary paperwork over about a week ago and I have yet to receive a shipment confirmation from them. I received conflicting information from sales reps last week, was even told I was dropped by my provider which was not true (but the most horrifying thing a patient can hear), was not contacted with follow-up information as promised and have called three times this week to get in contact with them and have yet to speak with anyone. I've been stressed and worried all week; I literally need these supplies to live. I am livid and disappointed and would not recommend anyone use this supplier. This is a MEDICAL SUPPLY company and any and all issues should be treated professionally and urgently.<//review>< pictures>

Since 8-22 I have called and e-mailed at least 8 times... Once they said they faxed prescription request to my Doctor... They did not.  I had my Dr. fax them.  No response ... They have never called back as promised nor did anything they said they would do.  I am filing complaints with Medicare, Soc. Sec., and the Attorney General.  They should not be on the Governments list of suppliers when they are unable or unwilling to be responsive.  I am now out of supplies, waiting for these 'PHONIES' to do what they applied with the Federal Government to do.  Lee Thibadeau< /review>

<text>ADS became my new provider of diabetes test strips in the summer of 2016 and it took months to get my strips.  Clearly the company was overwhelmed and did not have the staff to run this program effectively.  I spent hours calling and emailing to get the strips.  I ran out of supplies twice.  Finally when I decided it must be a fradulent company, I sent letters to the appropriate agencies.  Then a Sales person from ADS
called me and sent my strips but also many other products that I did not need or never use at a great cost to medicare my insurance and me.  And now I also have a pile of supplies that I will never use.  What a waste!!!</text>< pics>

Ordered  test strips and lancets almost a month ago.
Still don't have them.  I called and the girl on the phone had lots of excuses.
She said Dr. didn't send prescription.  I know they did !
Order still not shipped.
All of this BS didn't happen when I went to Costco and walked out with my order.
Customer service is lousy !< /Text>

I think this business is no longer operating.  I have been trying to reorder supplies since mid June.  I was PROMISED a shipment over a week ago.  I have called more than a dozen times, waiting on hold for over TWO hours without talking to a human, and have emailed them three times.  I am without my prescription right now.  My only conclusion is these guys are CLOSED and no longer in business.  If you are diabetic and relying on these guys you are way out of luck.</Text>

<rating>1</rating><review>I usually only write positive reviews, but my experience with Advanced Diabetes Supply has been so frustrating that I just had to write a negative review.  First of all, getting someone on the phone is nearly impossible.  If you leave a message, it takes days for them to return your call.  I am a Type 1 diabetic that uses an insulin pump and must check my blood sugar 8 times a day.  Even with sending BG logs and office visit chart notes, I have never been able to be approved to get the number of test strips needed.  This last time, after talking with someone at ADS at least daily for 2 weeks and my doctor faxing the same information to them at least 4 times, I have transferred my prescription to WalMart.  If you use an insulin pump and are on Medicare Part B to cover your diabetes supplies, do not waste your time on Advanced Diabetes Supply!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>This vendor supplies my CGM sensors and transmitters, but they are closed on nights and weekends and have no customer service even during business hours. The only means of contact is by phone and email, and they do not respond to either. They claim to have a means to text them re status of orders, Rx'es, and shipments, but this means of contact has never functioned. It boggles my mind that such a company can be doing business with my BC/BS insurer as a supplier of critical diabetes supplies, but I guess having no human beings on staff to make sure customers are actually getting their products saves a lot on overhead costs.< /review>< pictures>

This is a HORRIBLE company to get supplies through. They have "forgot" to send my omni pod supplies on several occasions, and then offering to overnight the supplies for free, they still charged me for the over night delivery fee. I have called the company several times to discuss this and when I finally got a live person on the phone they told me it was processed and would take a few days. It has literally been 4 weeks, and no one at this company can seem to help me. They also "forgot" to send my supplies again this month, and did the same thing to me. They are very frustrating to work with, and cannot seem to figure out that people with diabetes need their supplies and cannot go days without it. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!</Text>

<text>Having trouble reordering Dexcom supplies.  They used to call way too often for refills but now never call me at all. Trying to call them is tough and I'm not sure if they have a website reorder system. When calling I always have to leave a message, today because recording said they they are all in a meeting and can't answer phones.  Other problem is the number of times I have to renew/reverify my prescription causing me additional doctor visits and delays while getting all the redundant paperwor, this time just because it's a new calendar year.</text>< pictures>

I am now out of test strips thanks to Advanced Diabetes supply.  I have attempted for 3 weeks to get my 3 month suppply.  firwt it was because I needed a prescription trenewal from my doctoer.  then it was because he had not refilled it, and could I call him.  Then when I verified that he had refilled it, it was because he did not fill out the paperwork properly.  When I derterminied that was corrected, it was to be delivered next tuesday, When they determined today was also tuesday, it was to be delivered today.  I even called twice today to verify delivery.  Wrong again!  Now I can not test my blood!  There is something terribly wrong with this company, or is this personal?  Guess I had better find another firm to provide me with diabetic supplies.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I refuse to let my patients do business with this company.  They will lie to patients and blame me and my staff for their incompetence.  You are NOT required to use this business for your diabetic supplies.  Please call your insurance company and find alternatives.</Text>

I went when they just opened up and off a recommendation from a friend. Service was excellent and the food was good. They were friendly and helpful. I didn't try their soup of the day, but was told it is really good. May try it next time I come back to eat.<//review>

<Review>This dance club is small, gets packed up quickly especially on Saturdays. Live entertainment on Friday night with a good DJ. Either night is good to have a dancing partner, I've been there 4xs and yet I danced with any guy. Not much of available unaccompanied men. A restaurant is attached to it,if you've been to Tio Leo's off  Morena Blvd, it's similar to that one. Small dance floor also.< /Review>< pictures>

Hidden gem in the Broadway/H st. area, but well worth getting there. We were there for one of their monthly Lobster Fest dinners. Lobster was well prepared, our server was attentive and friendly, and we had a very nice time. We will come back!!</Text>

<text>Service was terrible. Server was the floor manager too! Unacceptable. Our drinks were empty for at least 30 min if not more. And when she came to bring out our food, she dropped the food off and walked away not asking if we wanted anything. It took us another 10-15 to get the manager, which ended up being our server.

First time I went there the rib eye was huge and delicious, so I returned to see if they were consistent and they sure were. Very good steaks and friendly service and I was never disappointed with all my visit.<//review>

Went there for steak because maps said that it was open until 2am.. come to find out after a certain time there is no food and turns into a Mexican dancing club.  I just wanted a steak dinner. This so called restaurant failed.<//review>

<text>I love this place! It’s definitely a convenient drive from my house to here. It’s quiet, the only issue is the homeless people that hang around and sell drugs right in front of their business but the storages are fair size as well as the pricing.

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>I have been an Extra space user on and off and all of them were great. I also recommend the one on Murray in Gilroy. I spoke with Edward inquiring for a parking spot for my boat and he was very informative, very professional and very kind over the phone. I am an elderly and people like Edward who treat people my age with great kindness is one of a kind. I did not end up renting because of the a rate was a bit high but my experience with talking with Edward was wonderful. I will totally recommend him and thank you Extra space for having great managers - TD< /review>< Time>

<Text>My review is based on flawed online process with “Rapid Rent” I decided to rent a storage on Sunday which I was aware that the office was closed on Sunday’s but the website offers “Rapid Rent” option which basically by using this option you do everything online and then enter your payment information then you are then assigned a storage and given a PIN number then you are told you can now move your items into your storage. I loaded my vehicle and drove from San Jose to Gilroy (Murray Location) not that the drive was far but when you’ve spent time loading your car and driving there to find the storage to be locked was really annoying especially when the payment was taken, so to say this option works well DEFINITELY NOT..as far as the facility it self it’s very clean and dollies are provided for your convenience which is helpful< /Text>< gmapID>

<text>Primo and Edward went out of their way to accommodate us when we asked for a 10x10 storage unit and a RV spot to rent. They patiently responded to our questions and gave us a special price offer. The place is gated, affordable, and the service is nice. What can you ask more for? Oh and it’s close to where we live.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Time>

<review>It was not okay this time, because the new employees decided not to allow me to read the contract I was signing. And decided to act very rude, very hostile, and call the police the police on me. Very disappointed in these people's behavior and really enjoyed walking in when Primo was there and especially when your most important and most polite employees Mike and Gino were working. Best employees you could have had. These 3 employees made your business run smooth. Thank you very and I hope my storage is still there. Unit 07.

Employees at Extra Space Storage located in Gilroy, CA are compassionate, understanding and patient. My confused and elderly father was notified to move his RV from another location and we were on a short time line that left us frustrated. Edward, the manager and his assistant listened to our dilemma and guided us thru the process with ease. His calm and friendly demeanor allowed us to relax and tackle our problem. We are so grateful to Edward and his staff.<//review>

Sudden changes in one's life can ruin a person's day. Needed a storage unit asap. Arrived  just in enough time to be welcomed by Primo who made it quick and easy to accommodate me with the perfect size storage unit. I was impressed how clean and well kept the storage units were and I'm confident I chose a safe and secure place to store anything and everything..</text>

<Review>I'm a tenant for over 10 years. I  have rented on a different cities, different locations, some times, renting up to three big units ($350 - $450) per unit.
Today, they cancel my access to the property, because I'm late with my payment.
that no, supposedly they were going to help us not to deny access right now that we are going through the pandemic ?
Every body knows, we crossing finantial rough time about pandemic ?

Having been here five years with no problems other than escalating rent. Nice and clean, great location and a friendly staff. Moved into a smaller unit with only a half hour in the office! Ultra clean bathroom for customer use. Mike is aware of the homeless problem and keeps a sharp eye out for any shenanigans. I would have given 5 stars if I didn't have to pay a "New" customer fee to get the Internet rate even though I've been a customer a long time. In my business loyalty is rewarded. Here a person they don't know from the Internet can get a better price than a current customer. So I played the game like a new customer and got a better price than quoted on a walk in!??  The new customer fee is not mentioned until sign up. Integrity would suggest loyalty should mean something. If I charged a new customer fee, they would go somewhere else. Corporate needs to think about that unless empty units don't bother them.< /Review>

Had to rent a last minute storage in the area.  I called the general line and spoke with a representative "Devry".  He was so helpful and walked me through prices and found me a great deal..... Fast forward to minutes later when we arrived to the complex.  We were met by Gino.  He was aware of our predicament.  He was just as helpful and knowledgeable as Devry.  Let me just get to the point....Very friendly,helpful and knowledgeable service...They got me a great deal and would 100 percent recommend this place!<//Review>

<review>Should have come to this place sooner. James at Extra Space Storage was EXTRA awesome. He is a very nice and helpful person. He made sure we didn't walk out the door dissatisfied.

I had trouble connecting with an actual live person via their automated service. However take into consideration it was during holiday season and I had no clue of their new holiday hours. Luckily I was able to connect with Mike a short time ago. Mike went above and beyond to help me out. He answered all of my questions. He made sure I was well taken care of. For that I am forever grateful. Happy new year! Thanks again mike. :)< /Text>

<Review>Mike Lopez makes the process so easy and even though it’s a bit further then many other storage facilities I chose to come back again. Safe, clean and super long hours makes it the best around. Was in another local one for years prior and the hours were so restrictive and closed on so many holidays that I was never to access my unit and there was no night time lighting or outlets. Hate having a storage unit but I’m glad I chose extra space again.</Review>< pictures>

Since the management changed we have had nothing but problems. The new manager James used my card to pay for some one else’s unit with out my permission, and refused to fix the problem because he didn’t want to get in trouble. When I went in to resolve the issue he cursed at me, set the heater on 80 and set the alarm off to try and get me to leave, he called the cops and lied to them. He threatened to evict if “we made fuss about it” I just want my money back and he is refusing to follow through. Horrible customer service I would never recommend any one while he is there. Gino on the other hand is respectful, very attentive to detail and has never had an issue with him. I have everything on video so he can’t say this didn’t happen. I need this fixed.<//text>

Last night I reserved the unit I was seeking and store manager called me this morning and left me a voicemail, even though I called twice and no answer; I came to the main office but it was closed for a few minutes. I was able to meet him and he showed me the unit and gave me some options. I was set within 15 minutes and showed me where to place my code to enter/exit. Great service overall. Satisfied customer 😊< /review>

I had a very good experience renting a storage unit. I was shown the size recommended based on my needs, and it was spot on. The process of renting was quick, easy & painless. The facilities are clean and I feel that my stuff is secure. The staff is professional and personable. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.<//Text>

We were blown away to find out this place as been in Gilroy since '99, we fully though it was only a couple years old. It's clear the extra space crew takes pride in their facilities. We were very excited to get a spot for our travel trailer and we can sleep easy knowing is safe and secure. James was awesome in helping us out. 5-stars!<//Review>< Pics>

Mike and Gino are awesome and very accommodating. Very professional and friendly, I have been a customer going on 5 years, I would definitely recommend this place. Since Mike and Gino left there has been very rude people working there, they are not the most honest either. Tread lightly.<//Review>

<text>I really love extra space storage because there property is always clean they have great prices & it's secured so I know my belongings will be safe. Also the managers Mike & Barbara are very respectful & professional. I've been a client there for a year & both of them have worked w/me to making sure I have the right size unit whether it was down sizing or upgrading. I definitely recommend anyone to use Extra Space Storage on Murray Ave. in Gilroy.  Thank You Mike & Barbara keep up the great work! fr. Jennifer<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>Forget public storage!   I have rented countless storage units over the last decade for work.  I have never had a better experience over the years than I have had here.  Extra Space Storage is warm and friendly.  They treat you like a person not just another monthly paycheck.   Extremely nice facilities and very secure, all at a reasonable price.   If you are looking for storage in the area, it would be impossible to find a better storage experience!  I don't typically write reviews but Mike and Patty have gone above and beyond the level of service that you receive elsewhere.   Just want to say thanks!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I had a great experience from the beginning to the end. I was greeted promptly and given the necessary information in renting a storage unit.
I was assigned a unit in a timely manner. The gentleman's name was Mike Lopez. I enjoyed storing my items here at this location. I would recommend Extra Space Storage, 8900 Murray Ave, Gilroy, CA 95020.<//review>

I was very pleased with the service I received today. Mike is very competent , polite and helpful. He showed me the different  sizes of storage units so that it was much easier to make my decision than just hearing the sizes and seeing pictures.
I will definitely definitely recommend this place to people I know.< /Text>

The Manager at the Morrise location is AWESOME!! Mike is always there and always extremely helpful, he has always gone way above and beyond the call of duty for a manager. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of their prices seem to be a little high.<//Text>

<review>Staff was Great, they have helped us with our mothers storage needs.  They have always gone the extra mile for us.  5 star customer service for sure.  We are in and out of there at least 4 times a week and the place is immaculate and secure.
The only draw back is that pricing tends to fluctuate rapidly.   Staff has explained that it's supply and demand, and that online bookings get better deals.  I guess I am going to teach mom how to use a computer!
Great Job to Everyone at Smartstop Self Storage In Gilroy! You are Awesome!</review>< GmapID>

I needed to rent a storage unit in Gilroy. Went into the Murray location. Very clean facility, safe, and the customer service is second to none. Barbara assisted me in find the right unit for my needs and I could not have been happier with the experience. Safe, secure, and great people here. Would recommend to everyone!< /text>

We were paying for our daughter's locker for way too long. When we went to clean it out Mike Lopez was always available to talk to and went out of his way offering us progressively smaller lockers until the project was done. If I ever need extra storage space I'd definitely to back to Extra Space Storage. I actually miss seeing Mike's smiling face :-)< /text>

I did some online searching in my area, and this place looked the cleanest along with having a lot of modern features for security.  They had specials online but I really wanted to see the units first before committing to anything and to my surprise right from the beginning Michael who helped me when I arrived mentioned he would make sure to match any online promo I saw.  I wasn't sure what size unit exactly I wanted so Michael took me out and showed me a few units of different sizes which helped me decide on the right one.  There was no pressure to get a unit that day but even though this was my first place I looked at I was happy with the pricing and service so I decided to get a unit same day.< /review>

< Review>
The staff here are excellent - I have no complaints about them. They go above and beyond and provide the best service they can within the corporate structure.
However, the 1 star is for the facility, which is disgusting. I left my household items in storage for 1 year while traveling. Upon return, my furniture was covered in mouse droppings. And I mean covered - there were hundreds of mouse turds on everything.
Furthermore, and just as bad, my stuff is covered in heavy dust. And it's not just agricultural dust from being in Gilroy. I have a brand new sectional. It was covered with the factory covers while in storage. It smells so much of dust that I can't sit on it without sneezing. This is a brand new sectional and it's ruined from being in this dirty storage facility.
I have used at least 5 storage facilities in the Bay Area over the years. I have never had a problem like this. My bed and sofa are pretty much ruined from mouse droppings and dust mites. The environment in this facility is sub-standard.< /Review>

I needed some storage space and the people at Extra space (on murray ave) we're like dealing with friends, and not some business.  They get 5 stars on service and professionalism, but Barbara gets 10 stars from me.     Beautiful smile    Thank you and for the smile.</Text>

Nice and clean. Friendly staff. The doors are very difficult to lift as if there is no coil spring to help with the load. The price is WAY expensive! You will get price increases  regularly.</Text>

Walked in to view a unit before reserving online. Was assisted by Jino, who was very, friendly, courteous and helpful. He showed me the one I was inquiring on and suggested showing me another that I hadn’t even considered and was beyonded  pleased with. He handled all my questions and had great suggestions. He made this process to a new city and facility very pleasant. The site and facility is extremely clean...Truly was one of the BEST I have seen
(all thanks to Jino and Michael for keeping it top notch) and seems to have great security. Was also very pleased that the manager Michael, lives on site, very nice for extra security. Extremely pleased with my choice to rent at Extra Storage on Murray and thank the guys for great work!!<//Review>

As a commercial driver I deliver to these facilities all over the central valley and bay area. Today I delivered to the one in Gilroy and I was very impressed by Mike Lopez. I have never had anyone come out and assist me with delivery before. He got out there, rolled his sleeves up (metaphorically speaking) and got his hands dirty unloading the freight with me. He is an excellent employee. Proffessional and courteous. Give this guy a raise.</text>

Thanks rejino Castaneda for taking your time and shopping for prices that's best fits my budget. It was a mess moving my stuff from San José to gilroy but thanks to your service and location I felt much better after. The storage unit has easy access and monitor by alarm system that is a big plus. Thanks for your help and honesty. Yourrrrrrr the bestttt👍🏻</text>

<Time>1450421172945<//Time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>Very highly recommended. This location is "new" - that is, although the buildings have been here for some time, the property has only just recently become part of the Extra Space brand...and they've done a thorough facelift on the place. I've been to a number of self storage places over the years, including some other ExtraSpace locations, and they always feel vaguely horror-movie-ish...long,  scary hallways with flickering light bulbs, rusty elevators and creaky doors. Not so at this place. SUPER clean, well-lit hallways inside AND plenty of floodlights outside, and freshly painted. Units are odor free, individually alarmed, and well lit  also.

My only suggestion is adding doorstops at the hallway entrances, and smoothing out the transitions from the ground outside to the concrete floor of the hallways...as it is, the slight lip of the concrete sometimes makes it difficult to roll a hand truck through the door.

Keep it up!<//text>< Pictures>
