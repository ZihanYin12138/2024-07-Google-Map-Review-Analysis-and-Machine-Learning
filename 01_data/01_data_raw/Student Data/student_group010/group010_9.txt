My mom and I came here last week for screen repair on her iPad. We dropped it off and Mr. Nguyen repaired it flawlessly. We are extremely happy and we look forward to recommending this place to others.</Text>

The owner of this place is wonderful. He is honest, reliable, great work and great customer service. I will never go anywhere else but here. He even backs up his work. A true Gem in Bakersfield California. If I could give this place a 10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I would.<//Text>

I love this place! It is literally the best customer service I’ve ever been to. He will do anything to work around when you need your device fixed, and also making sure he does a great job! He is so dedicated to his job, and I will never be going to any other repair place again. I dropped off two of my devices and he had them fixed the next morning, and he was very very communicative.<//text>

Top notch customer service and an overall great experience. I called Friday afternoon inquiring about an iphone battery replacement and to my surprise was able to be seen within the hour. Minh replaced the battery as well as installed two screen protectors for me.. all in under 20 minutes! He is fast but in no way makes you feel rushed. Pricing was very reasonable and I also liked the fact that he does the work in front of you, unlike other repair shops I’ve been to in the past. I will be recommending him to everyone from now on.< /review>

You don't get anymore professional then this. Excellent service, excellent products and fast repair time. If you call ahead, he will designate an hour of repair time to get your phone fixed right away. He also offers tempered glass, which is way better then any gorilla glass I have ever purchased, for a fraction of the price. Don't waste your time with the Apple Store.<//review>

<text>Outstanding service!  I called on a Saturday morning, just after 9:00 to inquire regarding fixing the broken screen on my iPhone. Minh had the best price around. He got me in right away—and he was finished in 20 minutes!

He has comfortable seating if you want to wait for him to finish, with free WiFi. He also sells cell phone cases, at excellent prices—of course I bought one!  Minh was quick, professional and friendly.<//text>< UserId.>

< Review>
I went here last summer got a new screen and battery . A week after I got the screen fixed i set my phone done softly on a coffee table and it cracked as if I dropped it. The screen had a shatter effect after from a small crack. My uncle changed the screen later and I haven’t had problems, but now the battery is already expanding and causing my iphone screen curve. He said the battery was an iphones battery and it would last a good 2-3 years and it hasn’t even be a year since I got this battery. As of now my phone is no longer bothering to be working. I was ripped off from this place.< /Review>

Where do i start with? Minh the gentleman, His humble business or the whole package? As a resident of SW Bakersfield, I've always looked for people to repair iphones that are trustworthy.

I found the trustworthy, But never found the professional person in them "No disrespect", But when you approach Panda Fixx you see a professional small sign on the grass, Sign by the kitchen window "I love that idea" chairs, Fan and Small window for transactions.

I arrived and called the gentleman Minh, He was super welcoming from the begining, He said one moment i'll meet you by the window.

Very nice, Friendly and most importantly very knoledgeable in his field, Made me super comfy.

For some people a panda is a cute and cuddling animal, For the Asians especially chinese culture means health and well-being, I'd translate it that they respect people and wish them the best. So for this gentleman to serve our community with such hospitality and courtesy is what Bakersfield is all about. Good people, Great community, and we all help each other "Caring".

I'd say call, make an appointment online or even show up, He always welcome everybody at any time, But it's always good to give him a head sup just in case, Go there and have confidence that you'll be treated with care and respect.

IF you really looking to fix your Apple device with care, on the spot and no problems in the future PANDA FIXX is the business for you, Actually the business for everybody.

Thank you Minh for your help, i wish you the best in your business brother.

Bakersfield trust me, You gonna all thank me ;)<//text>

<review>My iPhone 6s Plus screen was shattered and stopped working. I called around and pandafixx had the best price. Minh was very knowledgeable and professional on the phone so I took the drive from the east side. I was surprised the shop was in a nice neighborhood. He fixed my phone in less than and hour and made sure it worked like new again. He replaced 3 missing screws for free. He's shop is cool. Just go to his front window counter and ring the iPhone bell. The screen works and feels original compared to other places I've gone to.
Worth the drive for great price, professional install, customer service. Oh, he did me a favor and fixed my phone after closing hours!<//review><resp>{'time': 1502196885576, 'text': 'Thank Ms. Gonzalez for the great review and sharing your overall experience and thanks for the multiple visits with your other phones.

This guy is a master with iPhones. I spent over and hour with Apple on the phone with my iPhone 7 Plus issue. They diagnosed my phone and said it may take 48 hours for my apps to work again. They instructed me to reset my settings and nothing worked.
I called Mr. Panda and he fixed my problem over the phone in 5 minutes! Highly recommend calling Pandafixx for your iPhone needs. He is very professional. Thank you Master Panda!< /review>

Wish i could rate less than one star for a more accurate rating. Got a new iPhone screen installed and found a blue tint due to aftermarket cheap parts. Know wonder the price is so low with cheap parts being installed, if your looking to save a few bucks with a phone you won't like after than this is the place to go. If you want good oem parts to fix your phone properly I found a place off Rosedale and Allen with really good customer service and awsome work.< /review>

Mhin (sorry if I spelled wrong) goes above and beyond to make sure the job is done right. If you think he’s too pricy then you must revalue you’re options. He literally leaves it flawless. Like taking it the apple store, probably repairs better than them and you can’t beat his price.

Had an amazing experience with Mr. Nguyen at Pandafixx!! You can't beat his prices. He is very professional and friendly with fast service. Gives you a detailed receipt after. And don't be wary that it's at his home. He has a business window and has his actual shop inside. Very professional. Will go straight to him if I need anything in the future and I will recommend all friends/family to Pandafixx for any iPhone repairs. Thanks again, Pandafixx! :) very happy customer.< /review>

Amazing customer service , fast service , and prices you cant beat. Very professional and down to earth way better than going to these company's that are just looking to take your money and give horrible service at that. Takes pride in what he does and his customers. No reason to go anywhere else!!! Thanks again.

About two weeks later screen starts acting up i call pandafixx and no questions asked replaced screen no hassel and even gave me another screen protector free of charge. Good customer service is a thing of the past sad to say but not with pandafixx.<//Review>

Wow!!!! Had the pleasure of meeting and doing business with Minh (Pandafixx) and I am very impressed with his professionalism, awesome apple product repair knowledge, his skills and great pricing. Minh knows his stuff and he is very reasonable compared to other apple repair businesses in town. No waiting in line or fighting crowds. Just call or text him and make an appointment and drop off your phone. He will call or text you when ready. I am so impressed with this mans personality and all around nice guy. I took him my daughters destroyed Iphone 6 and he replaced the screen, battery, camera and microphone in less than 2 hours with appointment. The phone looks and runs like new. Thank you Minh. I can totally recommend Pandafixx for your iphone and ipad repair needs.<//Review>

My wife and I have been customers of Idler's Paso Robles for many years. We recently needed a new washer and dryer, so we called Idler's and talked with Wade, who was very knowledgeable, professional and courteous. In just a few minutes we completed the transaction for a new LG washer and dryer. Idler's continues to provide excellent customer service with competitive pricing. They continue to exceed my expectations.< /review>

We have made several purchases from Idler's over the years. They are knowledgeable and helpful. Today we were shopping for a Tempurpedic mattress and Colleen was great. She answered all our questions and offered a few tips we had not considered.
Edit: We ordered an adjustable mattress. It came in 2 weeks early! The delivery team (Justin and one other man) was prompt, polite, and knew just what to do to assemble it and demonstrate how it works.  Both men wore masks. The whole process could not have been better.</Text>

Idler's is my go to appliance retailer. They have the best customer service. A top Koch delivery team and the sales staff KNOW appliances. After having a horrible experience with Home Depots logistics company I switched and never looked back. Idler's will match prices too. ;) Simply the best in central California for your appliance needs.< /text>

The are super helpful. They came up with the exact solution I needed  to replace A dishwasher for my parents. While I was switching out the units, I discovered why my parents dishwasher wasn’t working. Since I had not yet installed the new unit, I asked if I could return it for a refund, and idlers agreed. I really appreciate that. They are 5 stars in my book</text>

<review>I had a wine refrigerator that needed replacing. Jarod, the salesman, at Idlers was so very professional and helpful. I highly recommend purchasing your next appliance from them. Especially with their great customer service which is so hard to find.< /review></record></dataset><record>

You cannot beat the level of customer service that you will get at Idlers.  They even offered to take back a stove I bought 9 months ago that didn’t fit.  It was totally my fault and even though it took me 9 months to call them, they were going to come get it and refund full price....  Gabe is amazing.  The sales team is amazing...another incident is when  I called them and my usual sales girl was out so the guy I bought from gave her the credit..btw I ended up keeping the stove and making the space bigger because I got such a deal to begin with, that it made more sense to make it fit...<//Review>

Jesse, Donny and Steve from Idlers in Paso Robles are the best when looking for a spa. We looked into several other hot tub, retailers, and the Idlers team was so great to work with. We decided to go with them because of their service, knowledge and a friendly approach. They gave us great information, answered all our questions and were so awesome when we needed time to decide on the best tub for us. I really loved the Nordic line. What I was really impressed with is this team did an excellent job in informing me of what I needed to do to prep the area so that the install day could be so smooth. I also feel great with going with Idlers because of the local support they offer down the road. This is our second purchase from Idlers and I plan to go back. Cheers - Nick Bryden</review>

My refrigerator went out. I called Idlers. I talked to Wade. I told him what I needed. He took my number and says he would look. Called me back within 10 minutes. My new refrigerator will be here Wednesday. Very happy!</review>

<Review>I have bought my appliances from Idlers since 1996 which is going on 24 years now.  I have always been happy with my purchases.  When I have had a problem they have always been there to help resolve it.  I would highly recommend them to my friends and family.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Idler’s gave me fantastic service and great appliances for a very reasonable price. They even price matched the bid I got from Lowe’s! Jarod Yarbrough was EXCELLENT! He spent so much time with me - answering all of my questions, offering suggestions, and trying to get me the best products at the best prices possible. He’s super friendly, knowledgable, and competent! I got exactly what I wanted for less than I expected to spend. I was completely satisfied with this shopping experience! Idler’s has won over a new lifelong customer - me!<//review>

Wade was the most knowledgeable sales person that I have ever met and I so appreciate all of his answers to my many questions. He was very patient and straight forward and was willing to take the time so I did not feel rushed into buying something that I was not completely happy with. I would definitely give him an A++++++</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>We bought a dishwasher from Idler's 3 years ago. It worked great initially, but then we ran into some challenges with it not draining and cleaning our dishes properly. Idler's was able to get the manufacturer to replace the pump for us which helped for awhile. Then the malfunctioning started up again. Ruth at the service office was incredibly helpful and persistent to work with us and Sam, our service person, to diagnose and eventually fix the problem. We bought from Idler's because it's a local company and we hoped to be able to count on them for customer service. They came through for us and provided excellent support. Next time we need appliances, we will definitely buy from Idler's.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

I needed a dishwasher & had certain options I was looking at. I bought one at a local home improvement store the day prior, with only my internet reviews to go by & not much for knowledgeable customer service, only to bring it home not to work. I walked into Idler’s with hope of a good machine & good deal. A salesperson listened to my story, asked for my wants & found one at another home improvement store. He offered the same item at a lesser price, but 1-2 weeks to order. I then looked at other models & asked more questions. He was so knowledgeable on all the models & showed me a special buy on a top of the line model, but over 1/2 off. It was a easy no-pressure purchase, I brought it home & hubby had it installed (super easy instructions), & running within an hour! It’s my 2nd purchase at Idler’s in the 6 years we’ve lived in Paso. I’ll go there first for next appliance purchase!< /Text>

< Review>
During the Covid-19 pandemic we expected Idlers to be on top of things regarding PPE while delivering and installing our dryer. I was assured by salesman Gary in appliances that they would have gloves, masks, and at my request booties. Well, they arrived with masks, no gloves and no booties due to a breakdown in communication with the sales department.  While the likelihood of contracting Covid-19 in this area is low there are cases of infection, so we stay informed and are cautious and would appreciate Idlers doing the same.< /Review>

<review>I’m updating my review. Idlers (and my salesperson Jarod) have done things right on their end. Jarod arranged for a quick evaluation at my house to be sure the dishwasher would fit. The crew that measured, and the one that installed were phenomenal, and extra praise for Jarod for doing extra work to get my dishwasher delivered and installed quickly and even ahead of schedule. My only complaint is entirely my fault: I fell in a Cove dishwasher, and glitches in either the firmware update after installing, or the app, or both made it impossible to register the dishwasher or use the smart aspect of it. Their website has no technical information to trouble shoot the problem, and there’s no one at the company to do that, either. Their (Cove/Wolf/Sub Zero) customer service is rude when they answer the phone, and no one there returns calls or emails. I would use Idlers again, but will never buy Wolf/Subzero/Cove again.</review>< rating>

We have been using Idler’s for years. They have never disappointed us. If there is an issue they are Johnny on the spot and handle it. The box stores don’t even compare. They lack in customer service by a huge margin - which is worth way more then a small price difference. Use Eilers because their local because they care and they’ve been around supporting this community since the 50s. Anyway that’s just my two cents I hope it helps.< /review>

Good people and good prices. We got a fridge for half price because of a dent on the side. Decent prices on the low end up to those dream appliances you drool over. I like how the showroom was setup and the comfortable chairs and couch in the front waiting area.<//Text>

I loudly complained about things, this is the only way she figured out who I was. Good prices. But everybody matches prices these days. Customer service goes a long way to getting me to tell people to go there. I then did not get back to idlers soon enough about a part that broke and immediately upon installation. I received multiple telephone calls and emails asking me about the part which was broken, I have no information because it's stuck in the back of the washing machine. I assume they could look it up. I asked them to send it to me because they did not want me coming in there unannounced. Finally after the manager agreed to send it via post, I was asked not to come to the store at all, for any reason, because we do not fit.</Text>< Pictures>

The outdoor living section of Idler's Home in Paso Robles is outstanding for several reasons.  Its outdoor living manager, Donny Stiver, is a talented designer who is exceptionally familiar with a wide range of products for barbecue systems, spas, and even outdoor cabinets.  Donny takes the time necessary to understand his clients' tastes and expectations.   Prices at Idler's are very reasonable (but not cheap for good quality) and very competitive.  For more extensive outdoor projects, Donny provides assistance with design and personally checks on the installation.  The two other Idler's Home locations, San Luis Obispo and Santa Maria, have less extensive outdoor living displays, but rely upon Donny's expertise to help its local customers.< /review>

We are extremely happy with our purchases from here. The refrigerator we bought is so roomy and just fits us. The washer and dryer work excellent. Our salesman was wonderful, pointed us in the right direction and let us browse. He was knowledgeable and handy.<//review>

<rate>5</rate><review>We shopped at the Paso Robles store today. Seth was the sales associate who helped us. Very informed. Very personable. He did a nice job of identifying our needs and preferences, but gave us room to look around and was available when we needed him. Just about the opposite from what we expect at a typical appliance store.</review>< user_id>

<Text>We've bought a few appliances at Idler's and prefer them to the big chain stores. In the buying process one is treated with professionalism and attentiveness to expressed needs. Renee' Wright was our salesperson and she communicated effectively in terms of directing us towards the machine that met our needs. The installation guys, Daniel and Junior, were terrific. Faced with a difficult second story kitchen with an L shaped staircase which was challenging to get a big fridge up, they did an outstanding job neither nicking the wall nor dinging the fridge. Hard work, well done. Oh, and Idler's provides service if there's a problem, a big plus in my book!</Text>< pictures>

<Review>The two main appliances I have purchased at Idlers are, first my  Whirlpool fridge and then a Whirlpool oven/microwave.
Work had to be done in order for the oven to fit into the space required.
After oven was installed, I was annoyed that after oven was turned off, the fan continued to make a sound. My kitchen area and eating area are together. This fact should have been told by sales person. Also, it would have been a courtesy to inform me not to place anything on bottom of oven to catch spills as in earlier ovens one could do this. It is mentioned in the manual but in such small writing, it was missed. Another warning could have been to avoid too much broiling as when broiling a lamb chop the grease that spattered, also reached in between the double glass of the oven door and made long grease spills that could be seen from the outside.
As I had purchased a three year warranty and this grease spill happened after my initial warranty was over, I expected it could be taken care of.
I was told it was  "cosmetic". This is unacceptable and I consequently
got in touch with Rob, manager of repairs at Idlers. He was extremely courteous and understanding and, as a courtesy, agreed to have a service person come and clean the inside of the oven door. This  is something I cannot do myself as the oven door has first to be removed and then the two glass panes removed.
I really appreciate Rob helping me out.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>John and Sam just left after repairing my oven.  Both were professional, knowledgeable, and friendly besides.  They arrived on time, knew exactly how to install the replacement part, and checked out everything before they left.  From the sales staff to the repairmen, Idler's is the best!

We recently purchased a new convection oven and microwave from Idlers. Matt Farrell the salesperson was a pleasure to make a deal with. He was very professional and helpful. The delivery and installation  team of Rudy and Jose did a great job of installing the appliances. Idlers is a great local business to buy your appliances.<//Text>

I recently had Idlers come and assess my fairly new microwave for a 95 consult fee. The latch was broken and the service department said it would be around 75 dollars to repair. The very nice service men gave me an estimate of 500-600 dollars for the parts, which was of course way over what I paid for the microwave. They recommended that I buy a new microwave. I’m very disappointed that the service department didn’t just recommend instead of having it repaired that I buy a new microwave that it wasn’t cost effective to have it repaired. Instead I paid 95 dollars and also had to buy a new one.
I have bought numerous appliances at Idlers over the last few years, but now I will be going to Lowes  I bought my new microwave at Lowes and The service people said it’s always better to just buy a new one. I will be going to Lowes from now on.<//text>

Purchased a rangetop and a hood.  Sales guys can be a little pushy, but overall they have a very good selection of products and often have something in their dented and factory seconds that are in the back. Worth  looking as there are some great deals in there if you can stand a blemish.<//Review>

A refrigerator I purchased from Idler's is down, and I called for a repair service. Wow...they are too busy, and can not come fix it until next week. A week without a fridge. Really? Probably will not purchase the next one that works from Idler's. (Dutch Maytag says they can come tomorrow).< /Review>

Do not buy a Bosch dishwasher from Idlers they do not service them.  Be sure to check before you buy anything from them since they do not necessarily service what they sell.< /review>

<Review>Aggressive sales ..... try to trap you to buying thing that you done need. Unprofessional working environment. Senior sales employee was training newly employee with poor tactic sales in front of me. I like it when an establish tells you that this person is new and I’ll be training him. That means that management isn’t doing a good job by training these guys what to do with sales and training.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>My husband and I switched over from Verizon to TMobile on Saturday. We were needing to switch over about 6 different lines so we were prepared for a long visit during this process but not prepared for a total of 7 hours. Yep. 7 hours!!  We dealt w Michael and Gina and they were awesome. We had everything transferred over in about 3 hours but then we had issues w my iPhone w the iMessage part where it wouldn’t let go of the temporary number instead of transferring to my old number. Gina and Michael was absolutely awesome. Best customer service. Gina said that she will figure this out and by 9pm we had it all fixed. They were on the phone w Apple. W TMobile support. Talking to people on the phone trying to get this fixed. They were very professional. Since we switched, our phones are faster. We are very pleased so far and will only deal w the Westminster store from here on.  Customer service was superb and they stayed after hours to make sure everything was handled for us!!  Thank you guys!!!!  Greg too< /text></record></dataset><record>

Worst customer service I have ever had. They were rude to me and made degrading comments to me. Would not recommend this store if you have t-mobile. Much better options are out there.</Review>

They are a bunch of crooks. Came in to get a upgrade. Got a phone. Great right! Rep said, oh it's comes with wireless charger, screen protector and a phone case. I was like sweet! They didn't say oh it going to be in your installment plan. You pay $36 a month for 2 years. But all the accessories come with the phone right..  wrong. If i didn't get the accessories my monthly would be at $30 a month. $6 a month doesn't sound so much but if you multiply that by 24 month its a lot. I could of got the $49.99 case for $20 off Amazon... I've got got on this one. Watch them carefully and listen to the wording.< /Text>

The manager there is excellent. His name escapes me, but he and his staff were very pleasant and professional. I highly recommend this place. I had a switchover from Sprint that would have confused most people. They handled it very well.<//Text>

My las review was really bad but honest (about a year ago). With all those "kid acting" guys. But now they are gone and I had to go back to the store few weeks ago and the story is now so different with the new management. Thanks for that good decision.<//Review>

Was scammed out of $125 plus tax at this store.  Went in to move my family members who were already Tmobile customers to my account and was forced to buy 5 new sim cards ($25 each).  Which were then activated with new numbers and took over 1.5 hours for the store employees to port the new numbers to my families current lines and numbers.  About a month later my uncle also wanted to join my account, I called Tmobile support directly to get this done and they simply ported his number in to my account, no fees, no sims...etc.< /text>

<Text>Don't ever go here unless you have 30 mins to wait. 4 people working. 2 customers and still a line to wait in. Do the math. Not one person says hello. Including the manager Alex who really doesn't ever seem to want to be at work. He makes that very clear !<//Text>< user_id>

<Review>Came in and was greeted by the two rudest, most unprofessional personel I have ever encountered. If I can give negative star, I will. To the manager/owner of this store, if you want to earn people business, read the reviews and train your employees how to be a representative. To anybody reading this review, DON'T GO HERE, go somewhere else!!!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>stopped by today to see if the apple air pods were avialable walked in there was no customers in the store only two employees behind the counter one male and one young female my fiance asked one of the employees (a young male, asian with short dark hair and glasses) he responds “oh no we are all out” and my fiance goes “ok well is there any other locations that might have them?” the employee goes “ya the apple store” he didnt even bother looking up any stores near by or calling around so we just turned around and walked out and as we are leaving the store we hear him say “uh i just want to go home!” i immediately thought wow should u really be saying that around customers?? ive worked in many customer service jobs and that is not professional wont be going to that location anymore</Review>< pics>

<review>I do not know why the T-Mobile to hire the less knowledge and uneducated Manager ( Jay) in this store. Reason: I bought the new SIM Card on T-mobile online for my Mom phone . And brought it to this store for activation . He (Jay) check it and told me that this SIM to use already. I ask him is it make sense .  The SIM still on card and never use .. How do you know this SIM used and still on this card . ..But T-Mobile seem like sold the bad SiM or cheat on the customer. I ask him you are the T-mobile employee and need to change it for me .  He did know about the T-mobile process to help their customer ... I just switch it to Criket ... I thought T-Mobile will be out of business soon if still this guy to run the store for them.  good luck< /review><Rating>1<//Rating><Time>1488731840279<//Time>< gmapID>

<Text>Lori is a horrible customer service rep at this location. Huge attitude problem. Very unattentive and ignored every question I attempted to ask. The off-duty manager was more helpful. I am suprised this Lori is even employed in a big company like T-Mobile.  Ask for Lauren instead, very helpful and knows a lot more.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Key thoughts - favoring Hispanics, jealous of tech people, unmotivated employees from low income

My experience
Customer service is not the best here.
After contacting T-Mobile customer service they were suppose to take customer returns regardless of any reason being defective.
The associate that gave my phone had a sense of jealousy or some sort of eager as I mentioned I purchased the new MacBook at the apple store and wanted to get the new iPhone to match my MacBook. Unfortunately associates here seem to not like they’re job.
After contacting customer service, I was told to go to a corporate t-mobile (not 3rd party like this one) to have someone write a report, was told that they are sorry this had happen and to get a return rejected after 5 minutes of use. (For the iPhone case)

I’m assuming they don’t get paid as much compared to corporate retailers because this type of service usually happens to people with low income or some sort of disparagement/unhappiness in life.

However there are other T-Mobile locations offer great customer service. As I got to keep my return and receive a full refund as an apology.<//review>< Pictures>

Great place to live and all neighbors are mostly families so its very safe & homely environment. I am living here with my wife for 2 years and continuing for many more. Ours is carpet flooring and you will get wooden flooring apt if needed. There are two pools with hot water jacuzzi next to it, two mail rooms, two gyms and almost 4 laundry rooms, so no hustle of walking all the way to leasing area. Maintenance service is very responsive and 99% of time my request gets done within 24hrs. The office staff and maintenance staff are very friendly and they will know you by your name. I would definitely recommend this community if you are family person and also if you are living with friends, it will give you homely  feeling around when you walk outside your apt. The community area is pretty big so families with kids prefer to jog/walk inside. I hope this helps your move-in with no doubts. Happy stay!<//Review>

<review>Below: pros, cons, tips and details of my security deposit (not as scary as everyone says it is).

Pros:
- Leasing staff is very helpful, accommodating and nice. It's always a pleasure working with them or just talking to them (especially Jackie)
- Maintenance team is really nice and responsive. I really appreciate all of them.
- I like how the apartments look. I'm on the 2nd floor and the vaulted ceilings feels nice.
- Dedicated storage space on the patio
- Very close to downtown Sunnyvale
- Therefore pretty close to the Caltrain station too
- It's pet friendly.
- It's one of the best deals you can get quality/price wise
- The laundry facilities are always clean
- Despite how dirty some people living here can be, the maintenance team always makes sure to clean the common areas and the outside feels nice
- They waved the cleaning fees ($60) when we moved out (because I asked for them to do it as they promised when we moved in - the cleaning hasn’t been done properly and it wasn’t really clean)

Cons:
- It's SO loud. Neighbors let their kids scream like crazy all the time.
- Overall, the worst part are SOME of the neighbors (others are great). They leave lots of dirty stuff on their patios / front doors. Some even left food for days in front of their doors! And then they're surprised to see cockroaches visit them...
- When we moved in, the cleaning hasn't been done properly. It felt a gross unfortunately .
- Doesn't have AC nor in unit laundry
- I felt like they charged a bit too much when we left. Pictures that I’ve put here are from when we left (was cleaner than when we moved in IMO)

Here is what they charged:
- 1x1 touch up paint: $129.17 (really?)
- 1x1 carpet clean (I cleaned them all)
- Cleaning: $60 (I called and they reimbursed me)
- 4 drip pans: $20 (that’s completely normal and I have nothing to say regarding that)
Utilities: $162.21
Total: $461.38

The reason why despite these cons I'm giving 4 stars is because we overall really liked our place and we loved the staff.

Also, I would recommend getting a corner unit. Otherwise the second window you will have in your living room (the one closest to the kitchen) won't open and you will have way less light.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIR2bdPiNJ9hxNpafZdVrJqfkhuWqyIj0MhRxI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4RPeD9MkYKal-WiXoCGFvoPaoDO0uF05URg76=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPymqi-gvg5_l5ugG9gFOsBHRJW5P5Lzj0BKVZG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkV3wlEIVtlwsGPewWwTb3inobxodpVEblunjx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNyp3Uet_CnPB_WLQfiGmiBWatsd-q1Y5H-Vfh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0-WBz8zzcj6C8efKeQsA30a7rx_quKjh1tTmB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQxj6XpAhahhSqjxnA4tobv1oQuokyxXnPmL0I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-rRiSIwwafbzbyDNI0wsFSJZEprPK7KtoPXpP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8zOgSOjGxLDFPIu6QiXZi5DIKmIRYy956WSmt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPW-Y0zk2Ee7EBNF8XFIEKf6Gi-qPFsjd9lbjsF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUurC5s20otFUgiW6Q7ysrcUQykV74jY-t55to=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhhc7C7oT3Q4qsjr6oFWSXgz7AAqKAFG4CTKkM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

This is a lovely place to live with friends and family,we lived here almost 5yrs everything is very nice ,but this apartment needs to upgrade its amenities especially washer dryer and remove the carpet with hardwood floor else everything is fine,friendly staff with lovely neighbors we are moving only because of its lack of amenities else office is very close by, one more thing I really felt guilty about that we have a lovely newly married couple neighbors as us but we never got a chance to interact with them as they are busy with their schedule and they left all of sudden which is really strange n not feeling good about that just wish I could ever meet them sometime 🙂<//Text>

Place:
Very nice and cozy place to live in. 13 min walk to CalTrain, Target, and Wholefood and close to a lot of great restaurants.  Across the street from three bus routes (20-21-56) and work shuttles. Very family friendly community and very safe.

Management:
Always been helpful and easy to communicate with all the time. They Emailed us when ever there is any construction, safety concerns, and even address noise complains fairly. They made it easy to move in and out. Their moveout charges been discussed ahead of time and even gave us options on what they expect and what they can offer. Honestly, their move out charges are fair. We had two pets but we kept our routine cleaning and vacuuming and we didn't see these crazy charges everyone is talking about.

**A special thanks for Jackie for handling everything since the move in, addressing any questions or concerns during the stay, and making the move out process simple. You are one of a kind. **

Maintenance:
Very professional, on time, and get things done the right way. They were amazing specially during the pandemic, they practiced all precautions when they visited. Laundry rooms are clean and kept maintained, public areas are spotless clean and maintained, even the roof of the parking spot is cleaned and maintained. It's that attention for details that makes it look perfect.< /Review>

<Review>We decided to move in because of the nice layout.

I second what Astrid, ying xie and some others said: The main problem is noise. The walls are thin, and the ceiling even more. Living here feels like sharing a house with an entire family of 4-5 or even 7 people. You hear TV, music, chatting, etc. We would accommodate some noise at day time, that's understandable. But some neighbors don't respect quite hours. TV has to be loud late at night, they don't care and there's little to no respect of community rules. HP office don't enforce these rules either: they'd rather let tenants suffer than give noisy people a notice that they have to respect the rules.

Not being to sleep well started affect our work, etc in the end it was untenable.

After 1 year, we left. I don't recommend this place unless you also sleep late and watch loud TV too.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
Nice community with greenery and at prime location gives it an edge. I had a terrible experience here. Smaller than a bedroom sized GYM. There were rats in our storage room in the patio. Apart from rat traps, not much was done. Worst part was, we were charged $1250 for kitchen counter replacement when we moved out after staying for just 1 year, which they claimed as discolored and could not be cleaned. We saw nothing more than a regular discoloration that happens over the years. It was discolored when we had moved in. Could not argue more. Ended up paying for their kitchen renovation. I absolutely do not recommend leasing here.<//Review>

It was fine when I lived there for more than a year, but they charged a huge amount of money at moving out. Just read the reviews here, and you will see a lot of cases that the apartment charged unreasonable amounts of money, sometimes several thousand dollars. In our case, it was around $1000, which took all the deposit money away.

Even with photo evidences that the kitchen countertop was already damaged before moving in, they still insisted on charging fees for that in a very rude way. They wouldn't reason with people and just list all the fees without looking at photos taken before moving in. The management there basically think they can charge whatever they want as long as they put it on paper and sign it.

The management office there didn't help and wouldn't reason at all. People there were extremely rude. This apartment would then ask debt collection agency to harass people and charge rolling interests for amounts due, which I never recognized in the first place.< /text>

<Text>At the beginning it was a nice place to stay, but then you get all the vibe! Noisy, construction, train, neighborhood is surrounded with impolite people who dont respect silent hours at night! Pool and gym almost useless and not clean. Laundry machines dirty. They tow away your car from your own carport, the leaf blower guy is blowing the leafs every morning for hours right under the windows! Not very well pest controlled. I am sorry but even the lower price for bay area that  I pay is not worth it.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>We moved here a year ago. Most of the units are renovated. All the neighbors are friendly and helpful. Maintenance team does a good job. I pretty much love everything about the apartments.

But my only concern would be about the washing machines(common laundry) not using enough water to wash the clothes. I even ran an empty cycle and was surprised to see the amount of water it uses. The clothes would simply sit there and rotate with hardly any water in it. The clothes stink after the wash so we started doing our laundry outside. If you have kids I would not recommend this place at all for the very same reason.

As other reviewers have mentioned yes there is an issue with roaches as well.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>I see a lot of disgruntled former tenants posting here, which almost put me off from living here. I lived there for a year. Management was generally responsive and helpful. Maintenance was very responsive and fixed all issues promptly. The facilities were decent. Overall given the price of the rent, it was good value for money.< /text>< username>

The new office managers are really friendly and nice. The maintenance staff are prompt and responsive. A lot of people in the community seem to be highly educated and work for companies like Google and Facebook. But there are also lot of uncivilized people living here who would sweep all their trash and water into your patio.</review>

Apartment/Location: 5*s. Great Location, Convenient and nice looking.

Rental: 5*s. Lease renewals are comfortable and comparatively better based on overall features than similar apartments in sunnyvale.

Floor plan/Space:  More than adequate space for 1BK/2BK.

Management/Staff: Jay has really helped us on lease and made sure our requests were clearly addressed and to our satisfaction. 5*s for him.
Office staff, Jackie , supervisor in-charge helped us all the time.
Maintenance staff are always attentive and quickly addressed any work order we might have had. 5*s for all nice people in the Heritage Park office.

This is  a great location that we always love.
Wishing all the best to Heritage Park Management and future residents< /Review>

I'm living here for about more than 3 years. Here are my comments
Cons:
1. Too noise and manager just say they have simple policy which just ask residents stop music after 10pm.
2. Charge very high when you move out.

Pros:
1. I like the layout, especially when you choose a right orientation (e.g. east-face and south-face)

2. representatives are enthusiastic: e.g. Jackie can be considerate of tenants.

3. maintenance workers are good.

4. Environment is green.

5. Most of neighbor are friendly.

Cros.
Management needs to be improved because the two reasons:
1. Shirk responsibility
Recently they make another change: each car needs to be attached a tag. But they just send several emails, if you miss the email, then you may hit the problem.

This morning I found my car is missing in my parking space, and I thought it is stolen, then I went to Enterprises(car rental), then go to Police, then found it is towed by Morris & Sons...... I cannot work the whole day and pay car rent fee $60 and $280 to Moss & Sons who towed my car in the early morning.

In my opinion, just send emails is not enough, they should also notice by paper or make a phone call for the events which may cause potential high cost for residents.

2. Charge tooooo expensive when you move out or even if within the same apartments.
e.g. I moved to another apartments after living 1 years and 3 months for house orientation preference and were charged $2800 including carpet updates($550),  Marble countertop ($1550)， Kitchenware updates ($600).

In my rental history, this is the first time to be charged so high, the highest one is only +$100.<//Review>

<text>Worst management ever!!
If only there was a negative rating to give to this place. We just lived here for an year and its been hell for us. After we moved in we had bed bug issue within 2 months. They blamed it on us and we had to pay for the whole treatment $2600. On the top of that when we left they charged us for replacing the Granite counter tops in the kitchen. Its worst community to live in and the management is terrible. They don't respond to your emails, they are very rude and charge you ridiculously at the end of your lease.< /text>< Time>

- This place is infested with cockroaches.
- Power bill varies with apartment to apartment. Some apartments draw more power readings (since they are very old) and other draws usual readings.
- Move out charges are unanticipated and it upsets a lot.
- Kitchen counter tops are very sensitive. It absorbs water and results in change in color. Water marks won't get dry easily on these counter tops. At the time of move out inspection, if your inspector finds the water mark, you could end up paying $1300 to $2800.
- 2 swimming pools are available. One located behind leasing office and it always looks clean and other at club house which is rarely cleaned.< /review>

<review>Management team especially the business manager (Heather) does not really helpful or listen to the resendital issues. She will just try to ignore or try to avoid to solve the problem. Recently she sent mail seemingly to encourage people who work from home during COVID to have rights to make as much noice at their convenience until 10pm. This show that she does no know how to properly manage apartment that share ceiling and walls (not the single home management). Sharing walls and ceiling building is sensitive to noice. Instead of giving strong recommendation for residents to try to keep quiet as much as possible and think of neigbor to avoid disturbance.

Beside Maintenance team are great and very helpful.
- Car can be towed anytime even you are the tenants (rules applied were not clear and not equally communicated)

Recent experience that they cut a lot of tree around the apartment area. They do not know that having more tree and greenery area is one of the factors that future resident really need and consider to stay.

Water and utlity are shared bills instead of individual paid (one who uses water less still have to pay more)
Nees lot of improvements for the managements especially bad attitude from business manager.<//review></record>

<Review>Good location near Murphy Ave. Office staff is very courteous and helpful. The apartments are renovated and surprisingly nice inside. The rent is high but we got one month free which made it a relatively good deal. The only problem was there was an armed robbery under the bridge once; management promised to increase security patrols.

Always maintenance work orders are done quickly. Also it has all attractive neighborhoods and downtown. Caltrain is close and walkable. The elementary school also nearby and walkable.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Heritage Park is a great place to live. It's a good community.

Benefits:
-It is 7 min walk from CalTrain Station and Sunnyvale Downtown
-2 Bedroom apt comes with 2 bath which makes it very convenient
-Its a clean and green community with gym & pool area

It has been great 11/2 years living in this community and hopefully it continues to be so<//Text></record>

I wish i could give 0 star to this community, the leasing office will take all your money once you leave this apartment by putting extra charges even if there are few minor fixes required after move-out, they charged me more than 1000$ for various things. I requested to do little adjustment in the move-out bill but the lady at leasing office was so rude and didn't even listen, i don't know what kind of people work there its insane. I wud not recommend this place if you care for your money.<//text>

They charge us for the whole carpet replacement when we move out, even though it was just a little dirty in the living room area. Also, when we move in , the kitchen room and bath room are not ready yet, there was trace on the countertop. When we move out, they also charge us due to the trace, just because we don't have a photo to prove that condition. At last, there's a railway near the community, could be noisy at night. Take a good consideration about living at this place :)<//review>

Kitchens have cracks in the wall I guess between the fittings from where they would come in. Pest control did not help. Later, we noticed that they are all over the community especially if you walk in the night on the pavements.
The Management makes its money by cutting the deposit money. Our previous apartment in San Jose returned 95% of our deposit as we kept the house clean. But that wasn't the case in Heritage.
This community can be maintained much better.

It's got decent floor plans and is located in a good area due to which the rents are crazy high. My husband and I stayed here for 1 year and then moved.< /text><rate>1<//rate></record></dataset><record>

2/5 Reasons:
1. Unnecessary move out expenses, specially for Granite counter top even it comes under minor wear and tear clause
2. Management hardly replies to your email queries, looks like very unprofessional
3. You'll have to chase management people if you plan to visit their office. In my case, I visited 5 times to resolve 1 query and literally couldn't met with manager, because she was not available each time in the office.

Can you imagine how responsible the management is.

I am still struggling with 1 of my friends issue. They are not co-operating with us to get the issue resolved.</text>

<Review>Apartments are OK. Not too much space. Pool and gym are namesake. Maintenance are brilliant. Trash management needs some serious redesign. Absolutely no easy guest parking.
Been living here for two years. I'm amazed how the management keeps getting more rude by the day. Every manager I've seen in this office seems to have a major attitude problem. They're mismanaged, and frustrated, and you better not happen to be in the office at those times (was only trying to report a broken laundry machine in the common room), or else they're going to take it out on you. The other office staff are really sweet and nice, no complaints (shout out to Jackie). Plus it's not like the apartments are super nice, so I don't know what the attitude is about. But the staff says one thing, manager says another, and then yells at you saying we never do that. Dude calm down, I don't make up these things.
I've heard stories that they charge exorbitant amounts at move out. Hope I'm proven wrong.

Glad to be moving out!</Review>< Pictures>

- This place is heavily infested by roaches....and the pest control hasn't helped even once. Obviously if you feel lonely and looking for some pest company then this is the place!!!
- Don't fall for the low prices as they will recover it when you are moving out.
- The move out charges are usually between 1500 and 2500 in the way of replacing all the counter tops, apartment cleaning, bath tub replacement, etc.
- The management is pathetic and extremely rude...and I mean really really bad.
- The swimming pools are useless and down round the year.
- And yes they specifically ask you to rate them good on internet reviews and I don't know basis what!!</Text>

I visited Heritake Park to view 1/1 unit. This would be my 2nd time in the last 4 years that I considered this place to move in. Reasons of rejecting it everytime -
- Management is extremely disrepectful. They gave us appointment on sunday and when we turned up, they said (being disgusted) the demo unit lights are turned off you need to re-schedule.
- Few units were available and said ready to move in few days. After checking the website, some other list of available units altogether shows up. The unit I was interested was said be not on rent until further notice when I called them up again.
- They denied touring the community and asked us to walk ourselves around because it was 30mins within their closing time . No visits to gym, pool or any other common area.

I will never turn back to this place. Thanks for wasting my time for the 2nd time.</review>

Worst experience ever. I came in to this apartment as a guest to visit one of my friend residing over there and parked my car around the apartment premises. Since I came after the business hours of the leasing office I couldn't take the permit parking and in the morning when I came to see my car I was unable to find it and later came to know that it has been towed.

It's really ridiculous there is no board or any kind of notification which says that the car will be towed if we park there or even the towing people didn't provide any kind of notifications. I was really worried and thought that someone might have stolen it and reported the issue to 911.

And then later a person informed me that they might have towed your car and gave me a number to contact those people and when I called them and inquired about the car, they said that it's been towed by them. I need to pay 300$ to get my car only because I parked my car there for 5 hours.

When I went to leasing office to inquire about this his saying is that guests need to park their car somewhere around the streets if they don't have the permit and when I asked him if someone comes after business hours and doesn't know about this street parking because there is no board or sign to intimate that the car will be towed, his reply is just " It's not our responsibility to mention that".

I am not writing this review out of anger on them, just wanted to make others notify that they have a very bad parking policies. Around the whole apartment premises there is no visitors parking and the funny thing is for any resident who already has a car and bought another car after business hours you need to park it somewhere around the streets otherwise no matter what your car will be towed. However this didn't happen only to me one of my colleague in the office was saying that the same thing happened to him, their guests car has been towed because they just parked their car outside the building without permit and came back in 5 min and couldn't find their car. They couldn't take the permit because they came in after business hours and to park somewhere else there is no such place around other than permit parking and just to say only 5 minutes.

Finally, just wanted to notify others who are looking to come in to this apartment please be very careful, it has worst parking policies and I have never faced this kind of parking issues in any of the other places which I have resided. You will really face many troubles with your car parking which is very important for all us.<//Text>

I moved here 3 months back, Paying like $2600 for a two bedroom apt. Their so called "renovated kitchens" are full of ROACHES.
They use poor Quality blinds, for Windows .
You will be shocked looking at the electricity bills, the reason being very old circuits that hogs on the power. Maintance is very very poor . The only good thing , it's closer to caltrain station.<//Text>

<review>Sign your lease:
1. If you want to live with cockroaches.
2. If you want to wash and dry your cloths in broken machines.
3. If you want to damage your car's paint with their carport's white wash (or whatever cheap paint they have used on the roof of carport.)
4. If you want to deal with rude behavior of management. Specially the manager.
5. If you want to wait at least for two week for your service requests.
6. Last but not the least.. if you want to pay thousands as move out charges. They will charge for changing kitchen/bathroom counter top even for water marks. I don't know how to save bathroom counter top from water. Do whatever you want to save your counter tops but you will have to pay for replacement. Forget about your deposit.

Don't deserve even single star.</review><gmapID>0x808fb6699ae377ab:0x5743387f006081b7< /gmapID>< Pics>

We paid 1 month rent as deposit as we did not have credit history. When we moved out, management said that all counter tops are damaged, floor is damaged etc. We lost our entire deposit money.< /Review>

I have been a regular since 2016. At that time, Walter Wong and company were the best around for European cars. But a few years ago Walter WOng left. And so did a lot of the regular, tried and true mechanics. Since then, I the turnover has been alarming. While the staff has seemed competent,  I have lost faith. And sadly, due to my lack of mechanical expertise, faith is all I have to go on. So, the other day I needed a headlight bulb replaced. The current "front of the house" mechanic who I had never seen before ( and I was just there a  less than 6 months before) advised me that the  bulb replacement would take at least 2 hours, would most likely require removing panels and bumpers.... so I did more research. And in 20 minutes, with a friends support, I replaced the bulb WITHOUT REMOVING ANYTHING.  Speechless. I have spent thousands, literally, at this shop. I may need a different solution. Sorry folks.< /Review>

Basically just ask for Walter. This guy is fair and very knowledgeable. Example: My RPM gauge moves up and down while in park (P). He gave me two possibilities that would fix this problem but suggested the lower cost option instead of the most expensive for my Porsche. Plus today he was $110 cheaper for a routine oil change than the dealer. A++.<//Text>

They were very responsive in taking a look. Called them in the morning, brought it over a few minutes later. By early afternoon they'd run diagnostics.
Sadly there's nothing to do to save the transmission (short of replacing it) but, since they weren't able to do any work, they didn't even charge for the diagnostic!
Super great and friendly team and would recommend anyone going here!!< /Review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>Have been bringing all my cars here for close to 5 years and have always been extremely happy with the service. This last time was like going to a completely different place - not sure if ownership changed or what happened but the service was chaotic, my car door had greasy fingerprints on it when I picked it up. I wasn't confident that my oil had been changed and I also brought my car in for check engine service light. After picking my car up and driving home, the car stalled on me and the check engine service light came on. Will not be returning.< /review>< pictures>

<Text>This business is engaged in a very deceptive practice to the point of ripping parts brought from a dealership. They punish a customer simply because a customer brings their own part. I brought  valve cover gasket from a Hyundai dealership because I wanted to have an original part and they ripped it on purpose. It is horrific. They also ripped a fuel pump gasket. I had previous incident too. This business must be shut down. I will also report them to the Better Business Bureaue and the Automotive repair and beyond. I will persue it further.  Very dishonest people .< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Your Right Solution is the most trustworthy mechanic shop I’ve ever worked with. Had an alternator replaced at 1/2 dealer cost. I send all my friends and family and never had one complaint. These guys are PROFFESIONAL and HONEST! I’d give 10 stars if I could!!< /review>

<Review>I visited multiple shops in L.A. in an attempt to find a trustworthy mechanic. Look no further, Walter and his team are professional, honest, and respectful - I even received a follow-up text to make sure I was satisfied. I can't remember the last time a mechanic asked me to come down to the shop to see exactly which parts required repair. Thank you, Your Right Solution.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>The owner Walter will walk you through the likely problems under the car pointing them out as you move along.  He compiles a list and then prioritizes the list based on your needs or requests.  The process is transparent.  Because they are busy, you will find yourself waiting a bit but no more than ten minutes at a time.  They work in the order that customers arrive.  They do not make appointments.<//Review>< pictures>

I recommend them greatly: they are really honest and hardworking people. I also bought a car to them and never had a problem. Every time I bring it, they explain everything, they are really transparent. The best garage for Saab cars!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I'M NEVER GOING ANYWHERE ELSE AGAIN! Walter is the greatest mechanic and man I've met. He did a thorough inspection of my engine and quoted me a price. Because he said other places could do it cheaper so he looked up a place that could save me money. Then he called the place, gave them all of the info, bargained with them to get the cheapest price and everything. Walter truly treated me like family. He broke down everything I had to do and say on the phone for future calls and held my experienced hand all the way through the process. At the end of the day, he did all that for free because it was a free inspection. Give this man all of your money.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>Went in for my 2007 Subaru Forester -

Walter, who runs the shop, is great and personable. He offered multiple practical solutions to my car problems and was patient in explaining them to me. My conversation with him was two people talking about a machine, as opposed to a salesman talking about some mysterious, potentially dangerous entity (as is often the case at repair shops). He understands that good business is built through honesty and good customer relations, not scaring the customer into immediate action, and I really appreciated that. It also doesn't hurt that he's a family man and that his shop has personality to it.

In terms of price, they are extremely competitive. In terms of quality, they are very experienced.

Very highly recommend Right Solution --< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< Rating>

Right Solution is THE Saab mechanic shop of LA. They've taken care of me and my Saab(s) for years. I stopped in for my routine oil change a month or so ago, and they noted that my brakes/rotors were due to be changed as well as a minor hose leak that needed to be fixed. They gave me a price quote for all the work. I came back a few weeks later to get the work done, and they dropped the original quote price by 10%, AND they were able to get all the work done (including ordering and picking up parts) within a few hours. I couldn't imagine taking my beloved Saab anywhere else.<//text>

Walter Wong is a no nonsense professional. He's an internationally respected Saab expert and good ole mechanic. He takes the time to explain every option to solve your car woes. You won't find better "mechanic-therapist" on the Westside, or ALL of Los Angeles for that matter.< /review>

I would stay away from this place if your looking for an honest mechanic. The owner Walter does make a list of all the services your car needs but he either doesn't know what he is talking about or he is just trying to get you to do unnecessary services. My car was perfectly healthy and I just wanted him to do a pre purchase inspection. He said my car needed a timing belt at 80,000 and when I told him that the dealer recommends changing it at 120,000 for my car he just made an excuse about how he has to check it and never mentioned anything about that again. Had I not known that he probably would convince me to change the timing belt. He also said that my car needs $3000 engine work because it was leaking coolant. After putting the car on the jack and seeing that there was no coolant leaking he said that it leaks at night, if that was true I would have to either add coolant or the engine would over heat and I don't add coolant and its always full like its supposed to be.  And just to confirm that my car didn't have a coolant leak I took it to a AAA certified mechanic who clearly stated that the engine had no issues or leaks. I am sure if he is doing this with me then he will do it to everyone else who walks into his shop. There are plenty of good mechanics out there so you don't need to come here. I'm sure that everyone who has given him five stars have either fallen for his tricks or they have only had simple services like oil changes from him.<//text>

I would stay away from this place if your looking for an honest mechanic. The owner Walter does make a list of all the services your car needs but he either doesn't know what he is talking about or he is just trying to get you to do unnecessary services. My car was perfectly healthy and I just wanted him to do a pre purchase inspection. He said my car needed a timing belt at 80,000 and when I told him that the dealer recommends changing it at 120,000 for my car he just made an excuse about how he has to check it and never mentioned anything about that again. Had I not known that he probably would convince me to change the timing belt. He also said that my car needs $3000 engine work because it was leaking coolant. After putting the car on the jack and seeing that there was no coolant leaking he said that it leaks at night, if that was true I would have to either add coolant or the engine would over heat and I don't add coolant and its always full like its supposed to be.

Same as most mechanics, they look you over before looking the car over and decide what they can hustle. Went there 2 years ago to get some new plugs put in, when i arrived to pick up the car the owner Walter pulls me over to my car and says "you need new brake pads" and then points at them and says they're worn out bad, but as he is pointing I'm looking directly at the pads and they looked fine, but I tell him its not in my budget and ask how long does he think they will make it, he tells me less than 2 months before they start to cut into the rotor. So when I get home I call my ex to come over and look at how bad they are, my ex laughs and says they look almost new, the guy was just trying to rip you off. That was 2 years ago and I have yet to change pads and ex says theyre still over 75%. So as far as my experience go they tried to scam me and take advantage of me, so I recommend only going to this shop if you know exactly what you need and can commit them to a fixed price otherwise you may be in trouble because you will not be dealing with an honest mechanic like these other reviews would have you believe. Best of Luck if you do.<//text>

I recently moved downtown and needed a mechanic nearby and I came across Right Solution decided to go in to bring my Yaris for a safety check.

The owner and everyone I spoke to in there are very friendly. They spent the time to explain to me that my car needed new brakes and he could do a so so job or a good job that'll last me a couple years. I decided to go ahead with the latter and I'm glad I did, the difference was night and day.

Higly recommend these guys and make sure you park in the enterprise lot!</text>

I can absolutely recommend Right Solution without reservation.

I just bought a 2011 Saab 9-3 convertible, and wanted to get the oil changed, have it checked out, etc.  I tried Ed Little and Cal, but neither one works on Saabs.  However, Ed Little's recommended Right Solution.  Which is noteworthy in and of itself.

ANYway, I brought it in right when they opened (at 8am on a Wed).  Walter jumped in the car with me, and took it for a test drive.  Really appreciate that he did that.  So we got back, and he had his guys go over the car for an hour with a proverbial fine tooth comb.  When they were done, they brought me into the garage and gave me a bit of a technical tour of the car, which was great!  Then Walter told me it was perfect...not a single thing wrong.  Asked me to bring it back in 5k miles for an oil change and in 6k to have the break pads checked.  I totally expected to have the oil changed because the selling dealer said it might need it.

When I asked Walter what I owed him for the time, he said 'nothing.'   As in nada.  Zip.  Zero.  Zilch.  I even insisted on paying for the hour of his tech's time.  He was adamant that I pay nothing.  Said that the check up was free.  He just asked me to tell my friends about his shop.  Which I will!

He could have changed my oil, replaced the break pads, and charged me $100 for the hour of time.  I would have paid $400 without even thinking about it.  Instead, Walter took the high road.  I'm beyond impressed.

You know what else I noticed?  He really respects his technicians.  Treats them like friends.  Maybe that seems random and irrelevant, but I think it speaks to his integrity.

I actually found an honest mechanic.  So, so relieved.</text>

< Review>
Don't let them near your RV.

Sorry I called them.  I scheduled to leave on a dry camping trip and I wasn't sure about my house batteries so I searched the Web for batteries.  I found Right Solutions Inc. who was more than willing to come to my home and install 4 new batteries.  The first mistake I made other than using their services, was assuming the installer new what he was doing and could connect everything the way it was.  When he finished I checked the charge on my monitor and found that the batteries weren't fully charged.  I was informed that these were new batteries and just needed to charge overnight, so I connected my battery charger and charged the batteries over night.  They were charged the next morning and as I left for my vacation I was confident that I wouldn't have a battery problem but I was wrong.  The next morning my batteries were completely dead and I had to use my generator which should have recharged my batteries through the inverter, but they didn't charge.  I called the warranty number on the battries and they sent me to the nearest dealer who checked the batteries and said they were good but could have been installed wrong. This was out of their expertise.  To make a long story short, since I left my battery charger at home I ended up purchacing a new on at WalMart in Arizona to charge my batteries. I finnaly had a mechanic look at my batteries and it was determined that the insaller connected a wire from the inverter to the negative side instead of the positive.  He corrected it and the system started charging. When I returned home I contacted Right Solutions requesting some type of compensation for the money I spent and was told that their installer experienced and would not have done anything wrong however, we all make mistakes.  They refused to compensate me for the extra money I spent instead they want to have their electrician look at my RV and see if there is a problem.  Of course there's no problem now I paid to have it fixed.  I will continue to try to resolve this issue but it doesn't look hopeful.  I thought I was saving money but it ended up costing me more.  Next time I will buy from Interstate.

I received a call from Rudy the owner of Right Solutions who informed me that he didn't know about the problem I had with the batter installation. It seems that the supervisor talked to me. Anyway the problem has been resolved and I was compensated for the money I spent while in Arizona.  It seems that Right Solutions is interested in providing good customer service by standing behind their work.  That's all I wanted.<//Review>

< review>
Absolutely terrible unacceptable this property management is. I've dealt with them two separate times both times having the same results and the same treatment which is not only unprofessional and unacceptable but it's despicable!!! So this time we're taking matters into our own hands and into the Court's hands because as you can see from the past year they have not done their part nor  held up their end of the bargain in this rentals agreement contrac to as far as what they're required to do as a property management company. I won't get into the specifics just yet, I will have an update once moved out.  People just need to know DO NOT go through blue star properties unless you want to be scammed out of thousands of dollars and hustled from them and the slumlord they represent.</review>

They charge thousands on move out even if you leave the property in perfect condition. They are unprofessional and blaim the owner for the charges and when you get in contact with the owner they blame the property management company. Not worth the derogatory mark on your credit and the fight to get the thousands of dollars in ridiculous charges off your credit.< /review>

We called a year ago to get a leek fixed in our apartment bluestar said they get someone out to fix it never came then they send a email saying it’ll be later because of COVID then never came still it’s raining again and our room is ruined and when we talked to the people who fixed the apartment they said there was no leeks and really tired to tell us there is no leeks when obliviously there is and now we have over a thousand dollars in damages we called they said they would called back and never did they only fixed the window in the room because there was a hole in it and didn’t even do a good job on that we called also about our toilet leek they never came also when I first got in the apartment there was hair on the walls that was just pained over two out on the three doors where the wrong doors that don’t stay close it looked like they just put any door on it’s way to small the bath room door doesn’t lock you can push it and it will open just like the room door<//review>

<Review>They will charge you for everything imaginable when you move out, no matter what. They have the nerve to charge us to paint the entire home a new color to prepare it for sale. We are not responsible for painting the unit a new color. See you scammers in court.

Response: when I call you know exactly who I am and what property this is about. Shelly is rude and unprofessional, and any other employee we speak to blames her. At the end of the day we have to take this company to court to resolve the unethical charges on move out. We will not pay you thousands of dollars for unethical charges. This is a scam company.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I rented from Bluestar Properties for 5 years. It was a cute home in Apple Valley. I felt that Bluestar Properties treated me with respect and addressed all my maintenance concerns. Bluestar Properties really seemed to work as a team to get anything I needed done in a timely manner. Thank you Bluestar Properties.< /Text>

<text>We have been without hot water since Thursday last week. Lupe told me that the Maintenance Man (onsite) would look at it this weekend, no one has done anything!!!!  I keep calling everyday and asking for updates and an ETA and no one has called me back. I called Tammy and emailed her also, she has not called me. Owner doesn't seem to care at all!!!  Been there over 4 years and are looking to buy a home ASAP. This place is awful. Owner is a slumlord! He doesn't care if septic tank backs up onto property! Carpets are 20 years old and padding is thin and nasty. They don't care. Missing window screens, they don't care!  One of their maintenance personnel shoved a crushed soda can under our kitchen sink to keep pipes up after finding out they leaked. It's still there. This place is seriously lacking proper preventative maintenance and it shows.  Beyond angry I cannot do dishes, do laundry, take a hot shower, and give my toddler a bath. But rent goes up every 2 months!!!  ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED WITH THIS PLACE!!!  SHAME ON YOU STEVE (owner of property)<//text>< gmap_id>

Bluestar has been managing my property for almost six months now and they are doing a Fantastic Job!
Maintenance Team:  Five Stars!  They are quick to contact me for requests from the tenant and resolve issues.
Billing: Five stars!  Detailed statements and on-line access to view.
Administration:  Three stars.  Not always timely in replying to my questions.</Text>

Bluestar does an awesome job with communication and I think that is key to any successful business plan. They have an answering service when they're unavailable... What more can I say? A website for maintenance requests to be placed ANYTIME... Oh and they do a good job when it comes to follow up too... ;)  Don't waste your time with someone who won't be there when you need them!! I've been in my apartment almost 3 months, and they're doing a good job still.<//text>

Bluestar Properties is the best property management company serving the High Desert in my opinion.  I have rented two properties from Bluestar in the past few years; during which time I had several maintenance issues which were addressed and repaired very quickly. Since that time, I am now an owner of an apartment complex which Bluestar now manages for me. I am extremely pleased with the management of my property including leasing out the units, taking care of maintenance problems, and accountant questions. The staff has been extremely friendly, helpful, and respectful to me throughout my various interactions with them.  I would refer anyone to consider using Bluestar Properties, whether that is to rent a property or for management services.<//Text>

My mother rents from  this rental company and 2 months ago I informed them of repairs that are needed to the toilet that is coming off of the floor and the dead bolt lock that has been super glued and unusable. You barely push the door and it opens when the lock is engaged on the door knob and it opens. Both major safety issues for my elderly disabled mother. Not a good place to rent from. And highly encourage people to report long standing problem with housing authority.<//Review>

Your name does not come up in our system, so we can not look into these issues. Please email the info to our office manager, Rick Iddings, rick@bluestarsocal.com. We will see why the repairs are not happening. Many of the properties we manage, owners do their own repairs and do not authorize us to do repairs. All repairs we do must have approval.

Put in a application online, have great credit, more then enough income, perfect rental history, I qualify for everything on their policy list but I can't even get a call back from them. On their website it says you will be notified of approval or rejection of application, nope i got nothing, called and emailed only got no reply and left on hold. Very UNPROFESSIONAL. Starting to think some of its a scam for info. AND WHO IN THIS DAY AND AGE DOESN'T ALLOW PETS ANYWHERE! Oh sure on their site its says in their policy section that they do but ive yet to find a listing that doesn't say NO PETS!< /Text>

<Text>By far the worst property management company I've ever rented from! Anytime there is an issue you need call about, no matter how important it is, you have to call multiple times and I still have to call the owner to call them for them to call me back to get anything taken care of. DO NOT RENT WITH BLUE STAR!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c366d9621a81fb:0x2b6991b92a9fd0b7<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Very unprofessional. I'm renting through them and everytime something needs to be repaired I have to call many times and leave many messages. After that I still have to wait days before even getting a call back. I'm sitting here right now with my kids in a 97° house (third day now) because they are incompetent. Maybe I'll get lucky tomorrow if they feel like doing their job. Oh wait, tomorrow's Monday so, probably not... 🌡🙄😡</Review><Rating>1< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Don't hold your breath whenever you call them or leave a message. Took forever to get things fixed. They take your deposit away even if the place is spotless.  The paper work you fill out at the beggining mysteriously gets lost. You should keep a copy and pictures of any damage. They will take your deposited away. They should be investigated.</Review>

This place is the worst! They lied just to get my $40 for an application fee. While I was there I talked with two extremely upset renters. They don’t do anything they agree to and they never answer or return your calls once you sign a lease!! Don’t do business with this fraudulent company!!< /Text>

Absolutely the WORST!!! They don't respond!!!! CAUTION!!!! REGARDLESS OF FAULT IT WILL ALWAYS BE THE TENANTS!!! BE PREPARED TO BE RIPPED OFF!!! Properties are mickey moused together in the first place. Carpet might appear clean when you move in but soon after spots will appear from walking on it because the padding underneath will be filthy!! but that and everything else will be the tenants doing. They supply the company that will fix the problem, and wow to a great surprise!!!! the problem was caused by tenant,,,hmmm wonder why????? Dispute charge.... you will be ignored, your rent payment will be taken to pay the bill and then you'll get an eviction notice because you didn't pay your rent all done with your electronic rent payment without your consent!!!,   still waiting on answer from 7 mos ago on registered dispute letter that was sent .  call leave a mess...call leave a mess.. go out there leave a message, go again.. call again..and again nothing!!! JUST THE BILL SENT!!! NO ANSWER ON DISPUTE...HMM CUZ THEY HAVE NO JUSTIFICATION</review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><pics>None< /pics><text>We rented the outdoor "escape room puzzle" experience for a team building event at work.  We took it to a local park and had a great time figuring it out.  They made sure that there were QR codes imbedded in the game if you ended up stumped on a clue and needed a hint.  We ended up finishing it in just over an hour.  The team at Code Zone was very flexible and helpful in coordingating with me for pick up and drop off.<//text></record>

We had such a great time at Code Zone - we did the Pirate themed one as a family and then my son did the Detention theme for his 12th birthday. The kids could not stop talking about how fun it was and us adults are itching to do this again. They create their own rooms/themes/puzzles and clues that make the experience so fun, unique and great. Highly recommend for all ages.< /Text>

<text>My family just had a wonderful time at the Code Zone escape rooms. We had previously done "X Marks the Spot" with 6 players and barely finished. Very exciting, with the right amount of challenge. This time we did "Get to the Game" with 4 players. Though we needed a few hints, we were able to get through it with a bit of time to spare and had a blast. I think this one is great for smaller groups or beginners who want a fun first experience. The staff is great and the atmosphere makes it comfortable, safe and memorable. Looking forward to trying their 3rd room!</text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Fantastic escape room, with the perfect level of difficulty. Clues are helpful without giving away the answers. The staff is helpful, friendly, and accommodating. I look forward to playing the pirate room next time I visit town.< /Review>

Our first double date night at Code Zone (X Marks The Spot room)  was great! Having done many previous escape rooms in CA and MD, this room was definitely one of the best!!!! Very fun, challenging and tricky! Had a great time and will highly recommend! Already looking forward to trying their other room!</Text>

<Text>We had family come up from L.A. and doing the escape rooms at the Code Zone in Petaluma were perfect for some great family bonding. The wonderful family who run the place were very nice and patient in accommodating our group of 14. We split into 2 groups, 1 group of adults and the other group made up of the kids. Code Zone was able to run both themed rooms concurrently so both of our groups could perform the rooms in the same 1 hour block.

Our plan was for the adults to do "X Marks The Spot" and the kids to do "Get To The Game." Both of our groups were able to beat our rooms and had so much fun doing so, we decided to book the next hour so we could swap rooms! Again, the adults were able to finish our room, while the kids came really close to finishing theirs. Super fun!

Completing the rooms was accomplished by dividing up tasks, with communication being the absolute key! If you see something, say something, because someone in your group may have come across something that may have you stumped. Overall, the rooms were really fun with the degree of difficulty of each being pretty comparable to one another.

I definitely would recommend Code Zone for a family group event or any other group setting for that matter, whether it be for a work team building excercise or just a group of friends getting together looking for some good fun! Thanks Code Zone! We had a blast!<//Text>< Response>

Everything about our experience with Code Zone was two thumbs up...their website made scheduling our experience a breeze, our game host was engaging, and the room was filled with clever logic games of varying difficulty that kept us all busy, had us working together, and allowed everyone to have a winning moment.
We can't wait to get back to try the second room as well as their Game Night experience!
Great work Code Zone, thanks for the fun! 🙌🧩🗝️⏳</Review>

We are a family of 6 adults who went to celebrate our youngest and oldest kids birthdays. We had a blast!!! One of us had done an escape room before but the rest were escape room virgins. So much fun for all of us. We will totally be back. The owner was amazing, patient and super friendly. Go, you won’t regret it! We were still talking about it the next day, such a fun group activity!!!! Thanks Code Zone❤️<//Review>

We had such a fun time doing our first escape room at Code Zone! The room was fun and challenging. Such a unique and fun way to spend an evening!

Went there on Oct 24th 2020. My party had a lot of fun and I plan on going back in the future. We played the Pirate room which was so fun I highly recommend it. If you’re in Petaluma and want a fun way to spend an hour, come here. The staff was lovely and the young guy who took care of our group was very nice! Thank you!!<//Review>

Went here for a fun distraction during my husband’s COVID birthday. Because it was during the week, all our friends were working, but we still had a blast! The staff (Sarah) at code zone was super friendly and made us feel comfortable right away. Code zone offers hand sanitizer and gloves (if you prefer) and regularly clean their escape rooms. We did X marks the spot with just the two of us and it was a challenge AND FUN! Support local business!<//Review>

<review>I have done escape rooms all over the world. Big cities, small towns, and everything in between. Code Zone has the kind of heart that makes an escape room really enjoyable. The owners and designers obviously created their games with passion and the user experience in mind. I highly recommend.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Code Zone is wonderful! We booked at a time when businesses were still open, to do the pirate escape room. When the new orders came restricting indoor activities we thought for sure we would have to wait, but Code Zone came up with an outdoor escape room. It had a board game theme, which I loved, and had creative and challenging puzzles.

Safety was priority number one and the “room” and all of its items were disinfected before hand and after we left. They provided sanitizer and gloves. Masks were worn the whole time. I felt safe and had a ton of fun.

This was my first time visiting an escape room, but it won’t be my last time visiting Code Zone. I look forward to coming back soon!< /text>

The escape rooms are wonderfully decorated and also challenging! Gloves and hand sanitizer are offered, and the rooms are sanitized. The owners are super nice and I will come back again!<//review>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Our kids (14yrs) had a wonderful time for their birthday party.  The room was challenging enough that they were pushed, and while they didn't quite complete it, they still felt some success in what they accomplished.  They definitely want to go back and do it again, and the other room.

Owners/staff we're excellent in their communications, and as hosts.  Very happy to have this in our town. Highly recommended.<//text>< Pics>

Code Zone recently hosted our Petaluma Active 20-30 club for a social event, and I cannot say enough about how wonderful they are! Incredibly friendly, helpful, & easy to work with through the entire booking process. We rented both rooms for a large group of 20+. They were accommodating in adjusting the times so the rooms could be run simultaneously. And very helpful with explaining how everything works, since about half the group (including myself) had never done an escape room. We had so much fun, a challenge for sure, but we made it out! I can’t wait to go back and try the other room! Highly recommend!< /review>

<Review>I was brought along to participate in an escape room for a friend's birthday party having never really done anything like it, so I didn't know what to expect. Whatever expectations I may have had however were absolutely surpassed by my experience here, both in terms of the level of detail and the complexity of the challenge. Definitely a great introduction to escape rooms and I'm sure a worthy candidate for experienced enthusiasts as well!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1578375712887, 'text': 'Hi Ricky!

We just had the BEST experience here for my birthday! We went with a group of about 11 of us and only one of us had ever done an escape room before. We did the pirate room and even though we didn’t get through the whole thing, it was super fun and quite the challenge! The owners did a fantastic job setting the scene and creating some really difficult puzzles for us to solve. We were at the very last puzzle when we ran out of time so even though we didn’t finish the whole thing, we all still felt really accomplished. Thank you Code Zone for an awesome birthday! I can’t wait to come back and do another room!<//review>

We werent sure about going during Covid19 but saw reviews about their sanitary practices that reinsured us.

When we got there and did the pirate escape room, our takeaways are:
1. it was very sanitary and everything was wiped down, hand sanitizer available, masks worn and you only do the room with your group.
2. it was fun for the whole family.  we were four  people including our 12 and 10 year old daughters.  We were on the last clue when time ran out and for all four of us it was fun and challenging and time flew.
3. The staff are the owners and inventors of the eacape rooms and are super nice and really get into seeing how folks in the escape room are doing.  afterwards they said when they traveled (before covid) they always do escape rooms where they go because they love seeing different escape rooms.  they also shared with great enthusiasm how they found the different pictures or props that make up the escape room.

Definitely check out Code Zone Petaluma.  It was a great activity for the family.<//text>

I went to this spot with four friends at around 8:00PM.
We were met right away and set up with our scenario.  We did the "Pirate" scenario and were immediately super impressed with the room.  It was challenging and got us all thinking and working together.  Definitely worth doing!<//Review>

Did the pirate-themed room in a group of 4 people. Decently high production value. The puzzles ended up taking much longer than any of us expected, but it still scratched all the right itches. Owner was very nice, and we had a great time throughout.</Review>

We took a group of boys for my sons 13th birthday, and they all had a blast! I know it was an experience that they will remember and talk about for a long time. Great way to get them working together in a fun way. We didn’t solve the mystery, but it was ok, they all want to try it again someday to get those last couple puzzles done. Great addition to Petaluma! Great location  for a fun evening out.< /Review>

Pearson's always comes through!  I tried other places and never got the service nor the attention to detail that Pearson's provides.  I should have known better!  Devin kept at the job until it was done and then checked afterwards to make sure everything went well.  I could not be more pleased.  The get an A+ as far as I am concerned.

<Text>Went to Pearson's to check out their washing machines. The young man who originally helped me was nice and professional. He told me he hasn't been working there very long but did well. The prices seemed to be reasonable. However, I don't understand how a company can charge $100 for delivery when you are purchasing from them. And we only live under 2 miles away. Asked about a rebate we saw online. I was told that it's an incentive to buy +2 products. I don't think that to be positive. We are going to be shopping around a bit more for what we need.<//Text>< pics>

Highly recommend. Went in this morning looking for a plain washer and dryer since I was going to only use it for about a year. The gentleman showed me what he had and didn’t try to sale nicer models of either. 20 minutes later I’m driving home with them.< /text>

< Review>
Very unprofessional. When the delivery driver showed up to install our appliance they said it would cost an additional $150 . That was ontop of the $150 that was already paid. Ten minutes later I'm being told now the the fee is $200 instead of the price quoted earlier.  When I called the store Mark (the seller) said yes it was an additional fee . Didn't mention it at the time of the sale. Pearson's will not see another dime from me.<//Review>

Best place, hands down, to buy your household appliances. I’ve been a satisfied customer for 25+ years, people! Our latest purchase = a Whirlpool microwave-convection oven at an unbeatable price, with all sorts of bells & whistles (remote controls, who knew?) Go there any day but Tuesday and ask for Mark - whose rapier wit makes the experience even more enjoyable.< /Review>

We went in looking for a double oven and spike with Zach. He was very helpful and really knew his stuff. We usually always deal with a member of the Pearson family but this "kid" was great. We've always received great service from Pearson's and the price is comparable to any of the big box stores. We'll be back!< /Review>

Prices are a bit higher than the boxed stores but hopefully my purchase won't come dented and have to return like it did when I purchased from the big H and Big B and Big L boxed stores. I decided to go to a smaller appliance store to get my appliances bad experience for our large retailers. Sales people were nice and accommodating got a fast delivery date too.  Lol<//text>

< review>
I’ve been going to California cosmetics for a couple of years just retouching my lips. Their staff is always amazing and the best. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because this last time I went in I paid for the keyhole pout and left without any of the results I wanted. I called back and the had me go in for a follow up and they put some dissolver in the middle of my lips to achieve this look, still no keyhole pout that I asked for. They said that it was because I had filler previously, which is understandable but I’ve only had filler twice before within the last 5 years. Also I feel like my lips are uneven I thought they could do something about that but my nurse said she can’t fix the asymmetric look of my lips. I thought that’s what they can do there.</review>

I am not sure what's going on with their phone lines but I have called so many times over the past 2 days and left voicemails to set an appointment. I waited long time on each phone calls just to have it end with they are too busy to answer. They have not called me back.< /review>

<Review>Omg I have so many great things to say about this place!! I had more anxiety just having to take my boys to the dentist since it was my youngest first time... the whole staff was so welcoming and they actually made my youngest excited to come back!! Thank you for being so kind to us!</Review>< rate>

They really take a generous amount of time analyzing your face and listening to your needs. As a patient, I can honestly say California cosmetics has mastered the art of facial sculpting.  Not to mention the staff is wonderful so friendly , welcoming and gorgeous!   I guarantee you , you will not be disappointed!!! Thanks California cosmetics.< /text>< Pics>

I had the non surgical nose job by Dr B and it was amazing.   I had a deformity in my nose caused by a botched surgery 20 years ago and Dr B corrected this in 10 minutes.  The results have lasted for more than 2 years now.  I would only trust Dr B with injectables.  He's highly skilled and personable toi.</Review>

I have tried many different beauty offices and this one is hands down my fave. Not only do they offer great services at great prices, but they genuinely care about your needs and do not just try and sell you on stuff you do not actually need. They are professional and friendly. It is an absolute delight every time I go. If you are on the fence about these guys, I can say from experience that they have earned my trust and business. Thank you California cosmetics!</text>

I recently visited California Cosmetics for some lip filler and first time botox. Dr. Ranat treated me with such kindness and love! First off, who knew doctors could be that HOT, this woman is not only kind, intelligent but is also a complete BOMBSHELL. My botox is perfect Dr. Ranat and I both had a vision for my lips and she completely exceeded my expectations! I have not left my house without being complimented on my lips. I’ve had fillers done elsewhere and this is the first time I have 110% happy with my results! I will be a forever patient of Dr. Ranat.</review>

My experience was amazing. Melissa was my nurse and she did a lip argumentation along with Botox in the forehead area. My appointment was at the Newport office. The staff was amazing as well. I highly recommend this place.< /Text>

I can't brag enough about this place! I have gone here 2 time for my lips from Dr. Barczak. I have been in the aesthetics world for 14 years, worked for the best plastic surgeon and my lips have never been this perfect. When I came to California cosmetics my lips were slightly uneven and I have always been told it was scar tissue build up and couldn't do much to fix it. He fixed it with no problem. I have gotten so many compliments on my lips. There work sells itself. They are absolutely amazing I'm a customer for life!</review>

I went here like a year ago and wasn’t very pleased I thought the doctor was very nice but the product not so much I got my lips done (juvederm) and I was very excited because it was my first time ever getting them done I had hoped for the amount that I paid over 600$ if I could remember correctly I would get the lips I always wanted but no. For the first couple days they were going in and out of being swollen mainly in the morning I would wake up with slightly swollen lips basically that happened maybe for 8-10 days after that my lips were literally back to normal(meaning how they looked before I got the injections) so I had swollen lips for a few days and that was it I felt like I waisted my money and up until this point haven’t thought of getting them done again. I didn’t feel like I even got the experience of having my lips done . Very disappointing.< /text>

<Text>Clearly I did not do my research ,My husband took my 15 year old son to get lazer acne scar removal ,now so see this place is just consumed of plastic surgery! Extemely poor customer service, I should of been informed that Lazer is  not offered at the Corona Office, I only called twice to ask questions specific for lazer only , my sons skin is almost clear I don’t need to be sold on other unnecessary treatments ,clearly all they want is your money their is the 100 $for the consult, I don’t need to remind you that the nurse repeatedly said to me “Well it’s a free country “ You decide !! yes thank you, Next! made us feel uncomfortable and walked out<//Text><name>Carolyn Silva<//name><response>None< /response></record>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I have been going here since the doors opened and have ALWAYS left satisfied, beautiful and confident! Everything from the warm welcome by the staff upon arrival to feeling at ease when about to have injections. I have had Botox and Fillers and Peels and I don't trust anyone else with my face but CC. The Dr''s make it very clear on what to expect in the coming days after the procedure . The technique they have with lip injections is unreal. More than a handful of people I know have now gone and have referred many of their friends and families.  I am also obsessed with the Makeup line they have called Envy Cosmetics.They have bold colors of matte lipsticks and glosses that  Im majorly addicted to. I highly recommend CC. They are very professional and so well put together there that I am committed to driving an hour to go there for my procedures.</review>< pics>

Most horrible experience ever!! Yes I agree they have competitive prices.. But in reality we all know we get what we pay for!! I can't complain about the staff, they are truly generous and the environment is clean.. Downside?? Well I figure since im paying for services to enhance my beauty I should be extremely happy with my results!!! I'm no beginner.. Ive had fillers done for years. I went to California cosmetics thinking I was going to be a happy customer since I've heard such great things. This literally was the worst experience ever, my lips totally came out uneven. It was clear to me && his staff!!! I wasn't satisfied so me being a genuine person. I went into the office hoping not for my money back because services were rendered but maybe a discount or maybe something he could possibly offer to compensate the feeling I was feeling inside!!! Nobody pays to be ugly or feel ugly!! He's looses major money && time injecting his employees to promote business but cannot bargain with a unsatisfied patient? Instead he trys to lecture me for a entire hr on how I must have some sort of medical condition. He may be a Dr. & think he can fool certain individuals, but my father is a MD && I'm not impressed!! It was clearly his fault for making my lips uneven!! I never have had this issue before so you could image how a person can feel!! He should have been willing to work with me because I manage a dental office where ppl constantly stare at my mouth.. I could have referred a number of people to him. Its just really sad to me that a person can sleep at night knowing these things and all the concern they have is loosing money. Hands down he clearly knows nothing about customer satisfaction!!!<//Review>

I originally  called to make appointment and I was in inquiring about the special that was going on "$100 off any syringe" instagram was promoting it from April through May in their New Port beach office,. So I called to make the app  I get to my app ON 4/29/17 2:30 PM (coming from Hemet Ca) and my appointment was booked with the Dr himself. I tell him about the $100 off, then he shows me the fine print, it does not include the Dr. only PA .Number one, the lady who made my app should have made it with the PA since I was specific on the discount and she knew it only applied to services with a PA (you don't run a business like that).. then the Dr asks if I have had botox or lip filler before (that's what I was having done at my app) he talked me into getting 55 units of botox ($715.00) which included brow lift...now looking at my brows 4 days later..I have no shape/arch anymore :( .. they're straight. I hate them. I did not need the lift. He knew I would just agree to it considering iv'e never had it done before and knew nothing about botox :(   being a Dr he should have known by looking at me that I wouldn't of needed it, or at least informed me that my arch would go away!  but again, because I was a new patient and never had it done before, I would just agree to it all.. then the lip fillers was ok, however, I paid a total of $1414.00 and did not even get the small laugh lines filled.   I paid $1200.00 cash and used my card for the remainder 214$  im not happy...but it is my fault, I should have taken the time to research a little more
my forehead does look good..it should for $715 but still it isn't an honest place and they could have me as a long time cash customer but not after my visit..
I also was not told about aftercare..my lips peeled etc..I should have been using aquaphor... oh well..lesson learned lol
++++++READ  ..there are other honest places out there and closer to my home..Menifee has "before and after weight loss clinic" it is also a spa..their syringe of juvederm plus (same stuff califronia cosmeitcs uses 1 ML has) for 395..and their nurses are great, and their prce for botox per unit is 8.50$   I work for a dr myself..a patient came in yesterday and had great skin, (no lines) so yes I asked her if she gets botox!  she said yes, and low and behold she said she goes to "before n after.. im not downing Ca cosmetics, but please look before you chose them you are only paying fo rthe name..iwish the dr was more for his patients and not the money..I pay and always cash..they lost me as a customer  ~ JENNIFER LORELLO-MENDEZ</text>

I had Botox around my eyes and fillers to my lips.  When I had the fillers, I had no numbing other than ice cubes.  Dr. Barczak was so good that I had virtually no pain.  My lips are very thin.  After the procedure, I had lips again and no lines around my eyes. The results were very natural looking.  I was very happy with the results and the gentleness of Dr. Barczak.  I would certainly have this done again.  I highly recommend California Cosmetics if you want to look younger with little or no discomfort.< /Review>

Mind blowing performance. Regardless of ages and cultures, you will love it

If you can, get fast pass for early entrance. Get to the front about an 45 min before the show time.

You can get wet from mist.
They ask people to stand up during the show< /Text>

<Review>Beautiful show! My thanks to a cast member who was so kind to my wife allowing her to sit down at a bench in the reserved area when her feet were hurting so very badly.

Great show for all ages featuring classics and the latest movies as well. Getting a fast pass or doing preferred dining is highly recommended as those viewing areas are the best. The dessert party has great seats but not sure it's worth the price for what you get. Very happy World of Color is back !</review>

First time attending any Disney themed park (I'm in my 30s). I expected a lot of walking but I did not anticipate all of the people, especially on a Thursday. My favorite ride hands down was Incredicoaster. I was able to ride 3 times, and thankfully, the wait times were never as long as advertised. My only disappointment was at the very end of the night. We were actually on the coaster and saw that a car was going to run again with only two rows filled. We asked (very nicely) if we could ride along with the last group since it was partially empty, but the attendant just pointed to the exit. I get that everyone has had a long day, but a bit of friendliness and an actual response wouldn't have taken much out of her. Also, by mid-afternoon, the bathrooms smelled HORRID. Other than that, wonderful day at the park.</Text>

Love this ride, everything you love in a perfect rollercoaster ride. Not too crazy, but perfect. Speed, loops, twists and turns. A must at California Adventure Park.<//Text>

Sorry, the World of Color water showwas "down for maintenance" on my recent day at the park.  I love it when I get the chance to see it !  But the water at Paradise Pier was experiencing "low tide"!   Hopefully, NEXT time...<//Review>

I brought my nephew in from out of town to check out a Frys. All I found was a shell of its former glory. Though there is some really nice under the sea decorations and fish tanks around the inside of the building. I'm not sure if the building was a different store before. They have very few good electronic items but the rest just looks like third party or swap meet type items. wondering if they rent out shelf space now?<//text>

Went to the store in August and found nothing but cleared shelves. Even the warehouse side of the store seemed empty. Did not have a single electronic item that I wanted, and the employees all seemed apathetic and unconcerned. One guy at one register, even though there was eight people in line. Took a half hour to check out. I hope I'm wrong, but I honestly think Fry's Electronics is checking out.</review>< Pictures>

I love Fry's and have a real hard time not spending a lot of money there. But when I popped in the day after Christmas to get a keyboard adaptor, the normally bustling store was deserted. It was eerie. But they had the same huge collection of everything electronic at great prices. .</review>

One of the most Beautiful and friendliest Fry's you will walk into! Their merchandising is on point and a customer service representative in whatever department you are looking for! It's clean, easy, and very organized!

Management staff is extremely dedicated to providing grade A customer service to their devoted customers!<//Review>

Sadly as of Feb 24 2021, the Fry's electronic store has closed permanently.  Both of the store locations in Arizona and the rest of the US has permanently closed.  Even the online ecommerce has shuttered down. Frys was one of the last remaining big chain electronic stores where you can get everything you need to build a computer, or any electronic parts, etc. Now its just Best Buy and Amazon.  Arizona needs at least another choice.  Where is Microcenter when we need one? Microcenter should open at least one store here in Phoenix.< /review>

Talk about empty. What they have looks like a swap meet inside. Needed 4 of 1 kind of item. Had to get 4 different items and modify them for project. Good place to go if you need gloves masks or gallons of hand sanitizer. No one is there so it is a safe place to shop if you don't need to buy anything.<//review>

Man....such a legendary store but...

It's just so sad right now.

Big aquariums, huge statues even bigger parking lot.... But no people?

No inventory?

No employees?

Fry's will always be my favorite electronics store.

However the pandemic hit fry's HARD, I can't believe I am about to say this but right now I would rather go to best buy....

Hopefully fry's will be back to normal after the pandemic.

Pros:

Big store
Nice decor
Big parking lot

Cons:
No inventory
No employees
No people
No noticeable sales

Why go to this fry's when you can just go to best buy and get a better deal and price?

Will alter review after pandemic.</Text>

<Review>Fry's needs to be in a far smaller space. Times have changed and Fry's needs to change with it if they are going to survive. Having isles that are very thin on stock or completely empty isn't a great shopping experience. Such a giant space makes it feel like a ghost town when there are few customers and fewer employees. The merchandise checker wasn't even there at the exit.<//Review>< Pictures>

Fry's electronics used to be a great store to find all kinds of goodies. this place is pretty much been stripped bear and doesn't have much to sell. The other day I was in there and quite frankly there was one or two people behind the counter and the rest of the store was devoid of any employees who could help answer questions. Really too bad it used to be a great store.<//Text>

Have you ever seen the shadow of a colossus?  A once proud figure brought low? A lion in winter? Such is the fate of all giants, to live past their halcyon days, to watch the wold leave them behind, and yet this titan lingers, clinging to the dirt and choking on the dust of new gods. Still it stands, and if you deign to visit, and stand in its nexus and are very quiet you can still hear, whispered low but still strong, "I am here..."< /Review>

Atlantis! I would personally go here to spend my time at the many aquariums they have throughout the store. The detail that these individuals put into their store themes deserves all of the credit! I only wish they would wear togas! Did I mention the fountain? Beautiful!

The atmosphere can not be beat. Fry’s has something for the whole family. The workers are polite. There are infomercial finds, lighting displays (literal electricity), games, make your own, and so much more.

The only negative experience I have had out of the hour long visits was at the restaurant inside. The worker didn’t want to help me, so I decided to spend my money elsewhere.

Check out this beauty... and be sure to look up at the light fixtures!<//text>

Once the mecca of electronics, now a lonely place filled with sadness. I have purchased so many things at this store. It truly deserves to be in the history books. But it's business model and sales tactics were ancient and the lack of care and attention is completely apparent.  They still have some stuff though and they price match so there's that.</Text>

Normally, I love this place. But due to COVID, the shelves were empty, if not entirely removed from the floor. When I asked one the employees if they would be going out of business he said "Probably". If they survive the pandemic and return to what they used to be, I'll highly recommend this establishment. There are always better stocked than most Best Buys. As well as offering a far wider selection of electronics and related items in general. Not to mention, a staff that actually knows what they're talking about in their respective areas. I hope Fry's survives.</text>

This store is open and nobody is there! Many shelves are empty. I didn't find exactly what I wanted and the kid who "helped" me was lightly tonal with me. But I found two alternatives that worked out AND it's a massive warehouse with no one in it!< /review>

Are they janky? Yes, but Fry's is my happy place. No other brick and mortar carries the kind of stuff they do, and Fry's' low prices are legit. I have a lot of business to conduct with Fry's, and I hope you'll support them too.< /text>< Pictures>

Went with two asus routers AC Raptor ac 5300/ Asus ac68u and Motorola modem under my extended warranty  on 12/7 to San Marcos Fry’s after ASUS wanted me to send them the products. I went to where I purchased all my electronics with the extended warranty. Like everyone says it was a great store in the past but when you have two un professional employees such as Andrea Williams and Tom Gamboa at this location things need to be shared  for others to know.  No follow up as stated within 48 hrs. I walked in and the store is a ghost town. The two employees have zero customer service skills.  I have also Facebook messaged the Corp office for a call back. I highly recommend no one to wasting your Precious time at this location or Fry’s electronics in general. No one is there to assist you but  seating in the back office collecting a pay check- Tom Gamboa. No one in the service area= Deadsville.

Hope this helps< /Text>

No help staff at the front door today, which is not a big deal except I hurt my foot and it pains me to walk and was looking forward to using a electric cart to go around the very large store. I could understand having only one or two available however this Fry's does not have any available. I think they ought to invest in one at least to say it is in use.
My experience itself was good. I found cool item I was not there for and really like it.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMm_tRcHoeWJCXEdCQgnHmE_jP0LhsdJwCjsSrt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgsusesHe3Ph1_uHDIYSDBizvIhhXHDK1dY7O5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsCWEB59hDO7xRIzhlPP4nT4DCtwmG-vZyCb6p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDBwuuuEAX8yLJ9d3YDy28IhRjFBrlFgs51ewh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Amazing store! In Austin, Texas, same store has a grand piano inside and outside. This store has humungous fish tanks everywhere. They contain tropical fish such as Dory. This place worth visiting. As for the store shelves, they are full of unique stuff, which is typical for any Fry’s store.</text>

< Review>
I can usually find any electronic device that I need. This time I had to drive a little further, since my store was sold out. But they were nice enough to call San Marcos and they were able to put it on hold for us. It gave us the opportunity to visit a new location.
Every Fry's has a different thyme. I think this was inspired by Atlantis... With lots of aquariums! Very nice.
Fry's Electronics... you need to open a store in the (Inland Empire) San Bernardino, CA area!</Review>

<Review>Under normal world circumstances I love Fry Electronics. However when I stopped by for a few small electronic repair items the shelves were bare. The store resembled an almost empty warehouse. Needless to say but I was disappointed. Hopefully they get their supply chains sorted out sooner rather than later.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</Gmap_id><response>None</response><date>1598204747206</date>< user_name>

This Fry's is AMAZING! The Atlantis theme is so beautiful! They have these giant fish tanks with some beautiful  fish. Very relaxing to look at while having some coffee in their deli. Went looking for a TV and was mesmerized with the store! They do for the most part only carry super high quality TVs' but it's nice to see in real time what's hot. We were not bothered by salespeople which is a major plus!<//text>

This used to be an amazing store. Now most of thier products are drop shipping items. Sad to see whoever did all their buying change so much. Please bring back reputable products! I also know COVID-19 ruined a lot of businesses.</review>

The store was very empty, of customers and employees.  The shelves were empty in a lot of departments, and they had very few TVs to look at.  Once I found an employee, they were helpful, but that took me walking to the exit to have the door checker call on the radio to get me assistance.  They also had the managers door open, where I over heard him complaining about something with one of his employees.<//Review>

<resp>None< /resp><text>Under normal world circumstances I love Fry Electronics. However when I stopped by for a few small electronic repair items the shelves were bare. The store resembled an almost empty warehouse. Needless to say but I was disappointed. Hopefully they get their supply chains sorted out sooner rather than later.<//text>< Pics>

This used to be an amazing store. Now most of thier products are drop shipping items. Sad to see whoever did all their buying change so much. Please bring back reputable products! I also know COVID-19 ruined a lot of businesses.< /text>

The store was very empty, of customers and employees.  The shelves were empty in a lot of departments, and they had very few TVs to look at.  Once I found an employee, they were helpful, but that took me walking to the exit to have the door checker call on the radio to get me assistance.  They also had the managers door open, where I over heard him complaining about something with one of his employees.</text>

I don't really understand it but this place has an incredible nautical theme. I'm assuming that it used to be an aquarium or something because it has some really elaborate decorations that I've never seen in other Fry's. Beyond the cool decorations this place has basically any electronic thing you'd ever want at a decent price. Make sure to stop here.</text>

I felt creeped out just being inside and was not rewarded for showing up with any products I would ever want to buy. This store was dirty, empty, and poorly lit. The store was huge with almost no products on the shelves, and the few that were there looked like they had been there for years. It felt like I was walking down a dark alley the whole time I was inside.< /text>

Lose a star for feeling like pulling teeth to get anyone to help you or answer questions, but the staff do know their stuff and were able to answer all questions that I had. My father in law who I went with asked for help finding something for screen mirroring options and he wad shown chromecast, the employee told him "this is what we've got" and just walked off. Another star lost for that. Employees are too busy talking to each other and do not seem motivated to be proactive with you, as highlighted in the other reviews below. So some improvement needed with customer service. They also have a small smoothie and coffee shop at the center, a well-maintained cylinder aquarium near the entrance, and overall a nice visual appearance to this store.</Text>

Absolutely awesome I had a great time the staff was knowledgeable in each department.
the environment is just a lot of fun to say the least
the layout of the store can be a bit confusing at times and can be somewhere overwhelming if there's something in particular you are looking for but if you're not bothered by this then you will most definitely be captivated by one of the many display items or interesting things they have while searching for whatever it is you are looking for definitely a fun experience but I wouldn't recommend it if you were trying to get in and out!<//Text>

However, now I entered the store but it was reminiscent of the grocery stores in Florida when a hurricane is coming. The shelves were bare and the place was empty.

After hitting a home run with their original mix that spanned everything high tech with the snacks to help out, they kissed just about every significant change in the retail space since.  First (and i. So many ways still) they missed the move to internet retail.  Missed the buy online and pickup in store symbiosis, the maker move... and so many more.  I have been there recently in search of PC parts, cable modems, car stereos, even a washing machine.  In all cases they didn't have what i needed... or even anything close.  I think o bought a USB C cable.  Which was nice, but I'm not sure you could even find that now.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Absolutely terrible store! Zero customer service, it’s a massive store with only 5 personnel working. Half the shelves are empty and very limited selection of TV’s. The store is poorly taken care of and looks like it’s falling apart. The floor is very cheap and half of it is not glued down. Do not go to this location!!< /review>< Pictures>

This place was a large empty building with less to offer than Walmart, seriously.  I used to shop Fry's in SD but haven't needed to make a trip in a while.  I went here for an OS and new Solid State internal drive.  The shelves were empty and the young man working the counter said to shop at Best Buy.< /text>

I'm surprised that they are still open. Shelves are 95% empty with many aisles completely closed. Been like this for months. What a shame! This used to be my favorite electronics store. San Diego location is the same, nothing to sell and no one working there who appears to care about customers.< /text>

<review>This is an awesome Fry's location. I really liked the Atlantis theme of the store. The fish tanks are great!

Good section of items. Everything appeared to be in good order. Restrooms were well maintained.

The online price matching makes Fry's a great brick-and-mortar store to support for your electronics purchases, and this location is a fun one to check out!< /review>< pictures>

<text>Not restocking, but not going out of business? Incredibly empty, devoid of stock and customers. What things were there didn't make for much of a selection. There was an exhibit on desk/computer chairs and my Mother seemed to find a drain plug for a kitchen sink, so if you came to an electronics store looking for that, problem solved! Also, many speakers and karaoke machines, some of both bluetooth compatible. Really, if you're looking for anything, I advise anywhere else.<//text>< Name>

This store is on its last legs and gasping for air.  Barely anything on the shelves, yet they cannot consolidate it to a smaller area to shop, so in typical Fry's fashion, you walk one end to the other to find one thing.  I was there to use an old gift card and wanted to get it done before they were closed for good, but 2 hours later I found one device I could actually use and got out of there as fast as I could.  It's sad and the end of an era.< /text>

Rather depressing to see the state the store is in these days. Used to be crowded at all hours with a great selection of everything.

Last few times I've gone the selection has become less and less, they seem to be cutting back on the employee hours quite a bit as well, as it was a nightmare to find anyone able to provide assistance.

The associates I was able to track down were extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and basically bent over backwards to help me find the cables I was looking for.

Still a great store, just feels like its slowly getting phased out by its competitors.<//Text>

Fry's used to be a good place to get electronics, like computers and digital cameras, DVDs and music. Then, in a misguided attempt to be all things to all people, they expanded too fast into large appliances, furniture, and other hard goods. Music and movies, not so much. This Holiday season, the store is VERY poorly stocked, with very little merchandise to sell. One almost thinks they are going to close the store, they just haven't said so yet.</Text>

<review>It's looks like the store is closing. Parts of the store are empty, most of their products are outdated, and they don't have a lot of customers. On the other hand, if you need something to do around this area, you should visit this store. The ocean/water themed decorations are very interesting. It's seemed more like a museum than a store to me. They even have a theater and many aquariums.< /review><Name>Lance Okuno<//Name><date>1577819707981</date><gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9< /gmap_id><rating>4< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Went to purchase a phone.neither of us the store worker nor I inspected the phone put it in my car charger to charge n no nothing ... went to put service on the G70 and the told me the phone didn't work .went back to the Fry's in San Marcos only to be given a paper with the info on it emailed called nothing back from the corporation.so I give Fry's a -10. Customers always right money was involed and that could go towards gas and or even my rent.</text>

It's a huge electronics store with a section for everything and plenty of great sales, which is awesome enough. But there are also fish tanks by the entrance and in the walls of the cafe, which is a great place to get a fresh smoothie. Stop by the massage recliner section to "test them out" and it's not even a Fry's anymore, it's a tropical vacation.<//Review>

They look like they are going out of business. No inventory in a Huge store. I got some line about the trade war with China and getting different suppliers bit they look done. Too bad. I enjoyed Fry's in the past.</Review>

<review>Was excited to go there today and take my daughter.  they always had my components i needed for DIY electronics projects it was sad to see everything gone. no video cards. no components. not even any video games. even the staff was scarce. I finally asked someone what is going on. he smiled and replied "i don't know what you mean" like nothing was going on. At least my daughter and i got to see the Fish and Jacobs ladders one last time. Its sad to see the end of an era. I used to spend hours wandering around looking at practically everything. RIP Fry's you will definitely be missed.< /review>< Pictures>

Empty shelves throughout the entire store. 15 cars in the parking lot. I could hardly find a staff member. No customers. A ghost town. A staff member told me his future with Fry's is uncertain. Clearly brick and mortar is going away due to online sales.< /Text>

Shelves are mostly empty. The employees are walking around and smiling in weird aways. Looked kind of apocalyptic, tbh. I used to love and browse, buy all my computer parts but they're all gone! Very surreal. They say they're waiting to be restocked but there's no way they're going to restock an entire giant empty store like what I saw.< /review>

There was nothing in the store, there was no employees to help or answer questions. And the cashier knew nothing and was not v0ery friendly. Totally waste of time. We will order from Amizon. He also told us to go to Best Buy.< /Review>

They look like they are going out of business. No inventory in a Huge store. I got some line about the trade war with China and getting different suppliers bit they look done. Too bad. I enjoyed Fry's in the past.< /Review>

I just needed a simple USB to USB C cable. I went to BestBuy and was told I needed to order online and it would be brought out of the store within an hour. I didnt have time to wait around so I went to Fry's on Bent. I was able to walk right in, get my cable, and I was out the door. Thank you Fry's!<//review>

Another one bits the dust. It is there but really shouldn't be. They have not restocked any items and are telling everyone they are changing vendors (for 3 months now). The fish tanks have not been cleaned in a while and might be considered cruel and unusual punishment for the fish.<//review>

They only price match products sold by Amazon. If it's sold by a third party they will not price match.

Place was a ghost town. Best part is checking out the various fish aquariums. Hate to say it but this place is a victim of Amazon's success. Visit while you can.< /text>

Unpleasant experience on Tues. 08/20/19. Bought a stereo  with turn table and no stylist from Fry's and bought a stylist also from Fry's previously. At that time, told Fry's could install it.  On Tues. came in with it to have installed, you
couldn't do it. The gentleman behind the counter nice and tried but another employee rudely said can't do it. We had the Geek Squad  come out to our place today, Fri., 08/23/19, charged only $50.00 and installed no problem.<//review>

<review>Good selection, good prices. Terrible service. It might also be a good idea to have more than 1or 2 people on the cash registers when there are 30 people in line. Ask a sales person to help you, and after the dirty look, they will act like they are doing you a huge favor. Maybe thats just my experience. Good Prices. Good Selection. Good Prices.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJX9mTRcpoUNp1j0gn0CgJktjOetjDqV2n82HT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</Gmap_id></record>

These places have really taken a hit since Amazon has taken over. It feels a little bit like the giant warehouse where the Ark of the Covenant is being stored in Indiana Jones. BUT, the selection of products is much better than Best Buy. It will be a problem if these stores close because of Amazon because sometimes you need gear same-day!< /Text>

I went in to Fry's in San Marcos to get two things a new GPS and a printer I waited 15 minutes before somebody helped me with the GPS and then they didn't have any and then I went over to the printer department and I waited 10 minutes for someone to help me and the guy was standing over there by on his phone and wouldn't even look around to see if there was customers as far as I'm concerned this store has turned from a good store to a POS store. I'm not sure if the store is closing or not but every time I go in there the store has got less and less items throughout the store and they're not saying anything to anybody about it so it's just not a good experience in there anymore</Review>

Let’s start with the staff!!! I asked a Lady walking the store whom was a manger where something was. She pointed to the area and said “over there.” I asked her to show me and take me there and it was like I just asked her to read War and Peace. After reluctantly doing so, I asked her to help me find the product. Before even looking she said “we probably don’t have it.” No I said, you do, it says you have 5 on hand. After that comment she was heated. I liked seeing how “hard” she was working, so I even throw in a another smart comment that went a little like this: “you guys love to point people in a direction and let them fend for themselves, don’t you?” With no answer I said, “see... how could I find the item, if you can’t find the item?” At this point she was overly mad, and hating her job, so I felt the need to push one further step. I said, “if you don’t want to help customers find an item, why do you work in customer service?” Once again I didn’t get an answer. If this is how management treats customers, I can only imagine how much their employees care. Only reason you can’t 100% avoid, is because the store (not the employees) may have something you need and you don’t or can’t wait. If another store has the item, go there!!! Even Walmart.< /text>

<review>Epic sized store with any and every up to date electronic device or apparatus you could ever want or need. The store is very clean and also has a place to sit down and eat if you want to order food. The selections and options are diverse and plentiful. The parking lot is large and always has open spots available. Most importantly though they do have the best prices and they will match internet pricing as well. Other places won't do that.< /review><Time>1554348179580< /Time><user_id>109827526153562794616<//user_id><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9<//gmap_id>< user_name>

<Review>Due to the issues going on with the tariffs, they don't have much stock of electronics.  I will say it was nice not to be chased after by a salesperson in the computer department!  I actually got to just look around, and found someone when I needed help😊< /Review>< pics>

I used to buy only from Fry's. They recently had given me the worst service I have ever gotten so far.

I had purchased a headset and a warranty with it.(not the same location but irrelevant for what happened) Not only did they were not able to retrieve my information because they didn't put in all my correct info which would have made this process and issue non-existent. But they once again screwed up looking up the wrong name and info which wasted both of our times. I even spelt my name 3 times and given my i.d. more times than that AND THEY STILL LOOKED UP THE WRONG NAME.

The service representative was just frustrated to the point where he just wanted to give up and send me away. Also, he tried incriminating me into his words saying I said things which were never said. Shady to a T.

I was once a loyal customer with a history of major purchases. No more. You guys don't care about fixing your mistakes. Otherwise, I wouldn't be taking my time to write this.< /text>

< Review>
Bare isles. I thought they were going out of business. Barely 1/4 of the placed was stocked. Large empty areas without store shelves. Their reply? "We're changing venders."  This was during Christmas. If they're not going out of business, management picked a bad time to change venders.  Their products have odd naming techniques, especially computers and laptops; In taking about name brand stuff.  Most products listed for Christmas were refurbished or opened or clearance items. Looks like they're going out of business. I'd steer clear for warranty and product value sake alone.</Review>

Whatever you remember fry's electronic's as being you can forget about it.

There is no inventory, the employees walk around, (what few are there) looking at their phones wondering if their job application to some other place has been approved.  You can't even buy a micro SD card in this place don't waste your time.

If I could rate with zero stars I would.<//text>

The entire store was almost devoid of inventory on this visit, not too mention other shoppers, which was really shocking considering we were there on a Sunday afternoon. It was a ghost town; my wife and I saw maybe five other customers roaming about and exactly ONE register open.<//text>

I give Fry's a 5 star not for how it is today, but how it once was.

I remember when I first moved to California and saw a Fry's for the first time. The massive Jacobs ladder running, the Cafe was bustling, the Deep see diver tanks lively and epic with the wall waterfalls, and the fish tanks full of such exotic looking fish and even a shark at one point. An electronic store that had so much, everything you could ever think of or want.

Their computer repair service was awesome, and they would hold classes to help teach you how to build your own PC. The staff were intuitive, knowledgeable and caring. And again, you could find EVERYTHING. Are you gamer? Upgrade your rig, get a new game, Mt. Dew and snack aisle right there for binge gaming. Need a fridge? Done. Are you a baker? Bam every kitchen appliance from overs, to mixing bowls to espresso machines. Everything.

This store was so phenomenal and was a great introduction to this franchise and the state of Cali as well. It had easily become my favorite location and my wife and I met so many great employees here.

Sadly the store has become a husk of itself. I have seen this so many times and its heart breaking to see so many shelves empty or removed. Fewer employees than ever and most seem to know an end is near even if they wont voice it. Their actions speak all. The fact that the Register numbers in the back row of the check out counter and all but 10 of the register computers are gone says they wont make it to the holiday season and they know it.

I have read all over that its not just this one but all Fry's locations are going through this. Its a classic sign of the end of a great franchise. I will miss them so when they are finally gone, and am waiting for an official announcement, but until then I will continue to try to support my favorite store until alas their doors close once and for all.</Text>

I always enjoy browsing at Fry's, but I moved from Mountain View, CA where there are several Fry's stores that provide raw material for all sorts of DIY projects.  The selection at the San Marcos Fry's includes less true Maker material.  It is a HUGE store packed with good values, but I couldn't find the connectors I was looking for: 5.5mm x 2.1mm DC Panel Mounts.</review>

I went during an awkward phase. There's a large cylindrical fish tank and other walls of fish tanks in the floor plan. I think it's supposed to be mythical Greek in theme. But because they were in the middle of management change, it appeared like the place was closing. I was wandering around with about 7 other people in this large building, and we all looked lost and confused. I'm sure it would be a great after the change of hands.</text>

They aren’t rude, but they definitely don’t go the extra mile to make sure you leave satisfied. I don’t recommend showing up with questions. Apparently Fry’s is a place to buy, not inquire. Find out what you need ahead of time on YouTube or elsewhere on the Internet, then pop in and grab it. That said, their selection is immense, so whatever you need they probably have it.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

There isn't much they don't have, actually have competitive prices. Just go in with knowledge of what you want. Staff there is trying to make a sale, also if building a computer, it seems they don't know about compatibility. Definitely go in there with a good understanding of what you need!</Text>

It's an amazing BIG store filled with a lot of everything.  They also price match.  We had the best service and will be going back there for kitchen appliance next.  Free delivery 😁.  After being there last night I'll be sure to go back and price shop again. They even have a restaurant in there!</text>

Love this place for shopping. Lots of items that you can't find elsewhere; electronic components, build your own computer components, sold on TV items, toys, video games, books, DVDs, phones, appliances, and much more. Nice cafe. Place is fun just to "window shop." Went there to look at laptops, had high end Apple, but doesn't carry HP Envy or many Lenovo products. Will check elsewhere.</text>

This used to be one of my favorite stores,  until they changed their model and now it's a ghost town.  Zero selection of anything and mostly empty shelves.  I came back twice in the last few months to see if they had solved their problem.  But no... and worse yet, the staff could care less.  I asked the only one employee I saw walking around if he had heard of any new updates on the store going back to normal and he laughed and said it looks fine to me'.   On the way out I said to the security guy that sits by the door and checks receipts, that it's depressing.  He looked at me with a uncaring state and said why tell me?  ...because there is no one else.  He said, well ask them.  Them?  Dont you work here?  Well I dont know anything.  Ok then.

Frys for now is dead, with not much of consequence to sell.  Dont waste your time.<//Text>

<Review>Now that Radio Shack is gone, Fry's should be more appealing, yet somehow it isn't. They have a good selection, but somehow just not what I'm looking for. At least thee salespeople are no longer so aggressive to get credit for anything you purchase.< /Review><GmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9< /GmapID>< user>

<Review>I don't think this store will last much longer. Half of the lights were off, it was very dreary inside, the inventory selection was very minimal (they didn't even have thermal paste), the staff was hard to find and rude when I approached them. And they wonder why people would rather shop at Amazon.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This place has a weird vibe, like it should be a casino or something. There's a cafe in the middle of the store, and there's an office/gaming chair farm. Genuinely feels like an aesthetic distopia. There's are fish tanks and fountains with water running upwards!
All that said, the store has just about everything you'd want for electronics and accessories. Pricing is good, service is top notch. Floor workers will be as involved as you'd like. Would recommend over other places like Best Buy.</review>

There are some knowledgable reps, but many are not. I've had to seek out the more knowledgable ones for assistance. The store is also very sparce. We used to get our larger electronic purchases there, but have switched to another local large store. I'm sorry to say that I'm just not so comfortable with large purchases there anymore. Even when I drive by, there are very few cars in the lot, not like in the past. I don't expect this particular store to be there too much longer unless they turn it around.</Review><user_name>Terry Lynne Wolfe< /user_name><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</gmapID>< Pictures>

<review>HUGE store! They carry just about anything that plugs in, and many things that don't, like office furniture, games, and exercise equipment. Unlike other brick and mortar stores these days, Fry's also has a decent selection of small components and accessories for building computers, gaming systems, and fixing electronics. They also price match, including online. There is one major downside however...many of the employees think they are knowledgeable and electronics savvy, but many of them are not. I strongly recommend that you research what you need before you go, or better yet, bring someone who is knowledgeable with you. Any time I have asked for help simply locating a specific product in the store, the employee has tried to talk me into getting something else that wasn't going to solve my issue. Very annoying and a waste of time. As for major electronics, like laptops, computers, phones, and such, we'll stick with Costco. That said, we probably pop over once a month for something we couldn't find elsewhere.<//review><UserId.>101308329568846894611< /UserId.><Date>1529341864615<//Date><resp>None< /resp><user_name>B E</user_name><rate>4<//rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Disneyland for electronics, but somehow their inventory has dwindled in recent years. Lots open floor space in some areas with nothing to fill it. Significantly smaller selection of Apple computers and displays than in years past. Used to be an easy five stars, but this location needs some work.</Text>< Response>

I spent two hours gift shopping, combing the aisles picking JUST the right thing for so many loved ones big and small. Customer service?? Not one employee asked me if I needed help - not one. I was in there two hours and DID ask three employees for help. I made my purchase but the dude at the exit podium relentlessly combed through my very full cart and the receipt for what must have been TWELVE MINUTES. He brought his highlighter into the game during the third run, and as he started the sixth round he asked me if I knew which item in the cart matched the SKU he was pointing to on the receipt! I decided to take the fruit of my labor back to the register so he could keep running his hands over them all night. I was dog tired and this poor unfortunate soul cheerfully let ALL THE WHITE PEOPLE pass with a nod and a smile, one of which stood beside me admiring this man's attention to detail. He tried to make a joke but this wasn't funny. It was humiliating and a waste of time. Oh well, Amazon delivers for free.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>Honestly my favorite electronics store. My only problem is that there is no one to help you find what you're looking for, and if you do find someone to help, they are almost as clueless as the customer. Other than that, great aesthetic.< /review>< Pictures>

As far as electronics goes, they have mostly everything I need. Even if I don't purchase anything during my visits, I can personally see the quality, options, and accessories a piece of equipment may come with. It sure beats the hassle of buying something online, being disappointed, then having to return the product and having to do it all over again. Big box stores still have a place in our society and Fry's is an example of this.

This location is normally pretty quiet and clean but be aware of open products. It seams that people like to open sealed packages to check the contents. But rather than purchasing the package they opened, they tend to put that one back and purchase another unopened item.

Black Friday here is insane but I learned that if your not one to wait in line for the door Buster's, they may still have the product you want if you stroll in during regular store hours. This all depends on the product you are looking for so don't try this for an item that is highly sought out for.

Make sure you sign up for their promo codes too. This can and will save you a lot of money when purchasing certain items. Once signed up just keep an eye on your email, some items are only discounted for single days and are usually in limited quantity.<//Text>

What used to be the best place to get anything for my computer has become just somewhere to go when you don't want to wait a day or two for Amazon. They have a decent selection for most items you need, but can be lacking in other areas. Stay away from any open box items, when an item is returned they usually just throw a sticker on it for a small amount off and put it back on the shelf. The shakes and sandwiches in the Cafe are good. The prices are usually comparable and be sure to search up the price online as they do price match internet prices, but they will be picky about the source.< /Review>

This location has been going downhill for a while now. The employees are merely collecting paychecks. In my opinion, they should invest those checks into etiquette lessons if not actual finishing schools.
There is no organization to what limited stock is occasionally available.
To say anything else would simply be pointless and derogatory.<//review>

This particular Fry's lacks a friendly staff. They seem paranoid that Customers are up to no good. You just sense it.  There are some knowledgable reps, but many are not. I've had to seek out the more knowledgable ones for assistance. The store is also very sparce. We used to get our larger electronic purchases there, but have switched to another local large store. I'm sorry to say that I'm just not so comfortable with large purchases there anymore. Even when I drive by, there are very few cars in the lot, not like in the past. I don't expect this particular store to be there too much longer unless they turn it around.</Review>

Hopefully it's just the covid 19 effecting retailers, but had nothing in stock. The shelves where bare and staff was difficult to find. The one or two people we could find, didn't work in the department we were looking in so weren't very knowledgeable. Left without buying anything.<//Text>

Great place to get the parts you need. Enough computer components you can walk in and put together a PC in one visit. Other consumer electronics,  and retail products available as well if you're interested in that kind of stuff.< /Text>

In the store, they have assistance desks, but the people working there (usually men) don't even know where stuff is in the store. Again, the price is pretty good, and they have great after Thanksgiving sales, but you could easily find the same stuff on Amazon.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I've used Frys as my go to local store for nearly everything electronic, technical or gadget for more than 20 years.  Upon arriving to purchase 2 normal cables (a 10' 15pin vga & a 6' usb extension) neither was in stock.  In fact there were DOZENS of completely empty aisles where cables & components used to be.  I will be very surprised if either Frys in San Diego County is open by March 2020.<//Text>

Good service when I finally was able to talk to someone. When I asked where the bluetooth where, someone replied with “over near the middle.” Never found them and two of us looked a while.  We gave up.  A very long walk to get to any register. Wound around as if 100 people were checking out. There were 3. I took the short cut. Richard in electronics was very knowledgeable!<//review>

<Review>I had to go back to the store three different times to get a phone charging cord. One said six foot cord but was a three foot cord inside of the package. The second trip I purchased a different cord and it did not work so I had to return for the third cord. With both returns I had issues at the customer service return desk questing my honesty. Be careful shopping at Fry's because if you purchase the wrong item or it's not what you want or need you will get a hassle on the return.<//Review>< Date>

Frye's use to be a great place. It now looks like it is dying. It may have 50% of the inventory it had the last time I was there, which was a while ago.<//Review>

Best if you know what you want before going.  Sales staff are not too knowledgeable especially in the electronics section.  I have experienced this multiple times.  Selection of products is great thus why the 4 star rating. Prices are competitive with price matching.</Review>

< Review>
Really sad what happened to Fry's... This used to be a place you could spend hours, it was very exciting to shop there. I went last week, hearing they are closing, thinking I would find deals but the store seemed to be in "suspended liquidation." Most shelves were empty with all popular items gone, what remained was not discounted at all, and what was left were only the items that got bad reviews or were overpriced or obsolete. Some small items I took to the register rang up for more than what was posted on the shelf and they wouldn't adjust it. Only giving them 2 stars because I had so many good experiences there over the past 20 years. Save yourself the time, its not worth visiting Fry's anymore.< /Review>

< Review>
I had to go back to the store three different times to get a phone charging cord. One said six foot cord but was a three foot cord inside of the package. The second trip I purchased a different cord and it did not work so I had to return for the third cord. With both returns I had issues at the customer service return desk questing my honesty. Be careful shopping at Fry's because if you purchase the wrong item or it's not what you want or need you will get a hassle on the return.</Review>

<text>If I could give it 0 Stars I would. The store is completely devoid of merchandise. It was pretty pathetic. The three salespeople we happen to come across were absolutely clueless and told us it wasn't their department. Then why were these sales people standing in that particular part of the store? It actually looked like the store is going under.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

A year ago I would have recommended this place.
They are literally not buying any more inventory and most of the stuff they're selling are things that have been returned already.
I went to build a new gaming rig, as i have done before, and they only had one option for a motherboard.
All of their shelves were empty.
They are going out of business and lying about it.
I had to make 2 additional trips back to this place, once to exchange the chassis for one that was compatible with the only motherboard they got (the salesperson told me it would work fine). Then once again to get the whole rig working only after I threatened to return the whole thing the store manager allowed the service department to do exactly what they knew to do to get the one motherboard they have left working, AND also to return the laptop harddrive he sold me that I could not use in this rig.
IF this place is still here, I would not recommend it.</Text>

<Review>They have lots of stuff but it very hard to find it, especially when they advertise the item. 90-95 % of the time the sale associated don't even know where to find the item you looking for. Only go here if you have to, otherwise avoid at all cost. I prefer Best Buy. People who work at Fry's are like people who work at Walmart. Some of them don't even want to help. They just point you to the section and They just pass you from one person to another.<//Review>< userid>

It appears they are 1 step fro closing the front door. Shelves are bare , only saw maybe 4 employees throughout the entire store. When asked what was happening they were very hesitant to say.  As I wondered the floor , all was thinking was what if you purchased something they still had and had problem with it and went back for support, the doors maybe pad locked. The computer tech person gave me a we getting all new suppliers when I asked what was up.  I am not sure maybe just this location.< /text>

First time to visit the store. It was more than what I imagined. Though we couldn't find what we were looking for because they don't carry Lenovo products. But I loved their games collection. Though I think buying online is more convenient than in store. Especially when meeting with unmotivated staffs.<//Review>

LOVE this store --- the best lit Fry's I've been in and their background music is at a lower volume.  Yippee!  The folks that work there are very helpful and friendly and I shop there quite often --- usually once or more a week.  My only suggestion to them is to add a few benches for us folks who use canes to rest on in this huge store since they don't provide riding carts for us.<//text>

<text>One star is 1 to many. They advertise "We match internet prices"  the great big banner says right on the front of the building. What it should say is  we might match some depending on what mood we are in. It is complete fraud, and karma will find those that work there and get them in the end. Never will return there again. Not worth the hassle and the drive</text><time>1539324866064<//time><GmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</GmapID></record>

Very sad to walk into the store and see hardly any merchandise and even fewer customers. Walked through the whole store and not one employee asked if we needed help. Surprised the store is still open, didn't even have Black Friday stock. Too bad there isn't better management and vision for the store. It will be missed.<//Text>

Great customer service in the store. Employees are nice and usually know what they are talking about. They don't try and pressure you into buying anything. Overall the store is awesome and the employees make for a great experience in person.

The customer service over the phone is less then adequate, expect 20min wait times before an employee will answer who will then transfer you and you will have to wait again. I've called 5 times in the past 2 days wasting a couple hours on the phone, the first time i got connected with a guy who had no idea what he was talking about and gave me some bogus info, he said if it didn't work I'd have to come in to the store, it didn't work. I simply needed to be connected to a sales manager who assured me he would send me some promotion codes for buying a new graphics card.

The next two times i called after a 30 min wait time nobody was answering in the department so the customer service put in a ticket with my information and told me i would be contacted shortly, which never happened.

I called again and finally got connected to the right department but the manager wasn't there.  An employee took my info and told me he had no idea when I might get my promo codes. The only reason i chose FRY's was because they offered the codes.

Currently I'm still calling for the codes and have had no luck, I wouldn't bother usually but its over a 100 bucks in video games I'd be missing out on.

Finally emailed the store manager with the details and had my promotional codes within a couple hours.</review>

Is Fry's San Marcos in a liquidation process? The store is almost empty, nothing on the shelves 20 days before Xmas. Would be better to close immediately rather than giving this impression of apocalyptic environment.</text>

I went on a few occasions whilst visiting the area, and it's a big empty (of people) electronics store. I didn't find any super deals, and believe me I looked. I'm guessing they do more online and price matching type sales.< /Review>

<review>if i could i give this store 0 stars, i would. the management here doesn’t understand how to treat their employees like human beings. let alone the customers. everyday before and after you go home they have to bag check every single employee to see if they’ve stolen something. making them feel like thieves, not associates. if you bring a charging cable from home, they’ll accuse you of theft. even after overworking you, they’ll threaten you to do overtime on your days off just because their understaffed. the store manager needs to improve on better management skills and learn how to treat their employees like the hard working people they are, not slaves. shame on the manager and his lack of any benefits. your employees and customers are not the problem for the corruptness of fry’s. i will not support their lack of good customer service and working environment for anyone.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9< /gmapID></record>

<text>Going to this place is almost like going to an amusement park, going there looking for one thing and staying for a while looking around from department to department. The aesthetic is fun and there's a lot to look at even if you just want to burn some time. Plus the price matching is a bonus.< /text></record>

<Response>None<//Response><text>Fry’s has been the place to shop electronics. It’s a similar place to Best Buy and like a Radio Shack on steroids. Great selection on computers, computer parts, printers and all accessories for computers and gamers. Wide selection in tv’s, car audio and home appliances. Very competitive pricing. Will match internet prices last time I went.
Huge aquarium. It’s just nice to see so many fish in a huge glass tank.
You will also find many other products for home, car or office. Highly recommended.
I like the San Marcos Blvd Store.

The greeters, cashiers and customer service people are helpful. Unfortunately most of the department "specialists" are not much help. I'd recommend doing your own research if you need help figuring out what you need. Otherwise, the deals are pretty good​ and they do price match. Although one employee asked me to sign into my own Amazon Prime account on their computer in order to give me the price match.</review>

Why buy electronics especially computers anywhere else when this place is far cheaper? I purchased my second computer here 2 months ago after doing research in prices.  I found it $323 cheaper here!    This place is the best for electronics, period.   Service is execllent also!</text>

But had go back return toaster, associate return it great but ask that my refund and she said yes.  Then i ask her if I get refund for the warranty and she totally forgot. she didn't look really good receipt that i purchase just one "1" item and warranty.
If I didn't look at the receipt before i left the store there will be issue warranty get refund.

Not alot selection of toaster, was to small that I was looking for.

EVERYONE PLEASE LOOK AT YOUR RECEIPT BEFORE RETURN AND SEE IF YOU GET FULL REFUND BACK WITH WARRANTY.< /Review></record>

Probably the biggest "electronics store" I have ever seen. I use quotation as they sell much more, toys, exercise equipment, have a cafe inside and very unique artwork and water features inside. Had exactly what we needed to finish a job in San Diego since we were shipped UK power adapters for a big project. Probably the size of a super Walmart, but did take 4 different staff members to help find what we needed.< /review>

<text>I just went to this store today and some of the employees weren't really helpful. One of them was kind of rude. At around 7pm, my friend and I wanted to inquire about their exercise equipments.

We went up to 4 employees in the Computer Department that were too busy talking & laughing with each other to help us out. One of them said that the exercise equipments weren't their department. Uhm. Okay? I was expecting him to at least call or walk us to an employee that works in the department. Instead we had to wander around the store and do it our own.

A few minutes later, we found another employee that tried to look in the back to see if a specific equipment was in stock and she took FOREVER. We just decided that it wasn't worth the wait and just left.

I would like to see an improvement with the customer service of most (if not all) the employees at this store. It's sad to see most of them unhappy with their job. I at least enjoyed the beautiful ocean-themed layout of the store.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I used to love going to Fry's. It was always a fun experience checking out the giant fishtanks and browsing the vast inventory. I could always find some obscure movie or CD and enjoy people watching with crowds on Saturday afternoon. That was four years ago.
I went back today to show my 10 year old what an awesome place Fry's was and browse the CDs and DVDs . We were completely disappointed. Not only did they have virtually no CDs or DVDs, half the shelves in the entire store were empty. On a Saturday afternoon there was one register out of twenty open and maybe a dozen customers in the store. How they are still in business like this is beyond my understanding. I don't expect it to remain around much longer. I have no reason to ever go there again. It's a shame.< /review>

Great prices, customer service, a wide range of products large and small. I bought some headphones at half price with a coupon code in the store. The store is bibantic and has stuff on top of stuff but well organized. The store I went to in San Diego has an aquarium and a cafe! Low prices, high end prices,  great service, I could spend my paycheck here every week! Awesome place.< /Review>

A great place for a large amount of electronics. I usually come here for electrical odds and ends. I have bought, a lot of things from them and will continue to do so. Much better than best buy.</Review>

< Review>
We don't have a Fry's where I'm from and I used to frequent radio shack. I was looking for some electronics components to fix my microwave and my buddy said just go to Fry's. I of course had no idea what he was talking about, but decided I'd go anyways. I walked in there with the intention of buying two or three small components and I walked out with over $300 dollars of gear. This store is the coolest store I've ever been in. Some of the prices can be a bit high but they will have sales that are unbelievable. If you are looking for almost anything technology related chances are they'll have it. Are you trying to build your first pc? They're employee's in that department are pretty knowledgeable and will help you find the best bang for your buck. I would recommend this store to anyone who asks about it. 10/10 will shop at again.</Review>

<review>Just awful retail experience every time in this store.  Audio guys are always BLASTING techno or hip hop music. It’s so loud you can’t even think.  I’m in my early 30’s and am used to loud music but not when shopping.  They aren’t playing it for a customer demo but rather for their own enjoyment.  This is a consistent problem with this store.  The staff in the TV department aren’t very knowledgeable and struggle to communicate. Prices are low, but are often beat by the internet.  When you go to price guarantee they make it difficult. Never going back, it too painful of an experience.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Would have been 5 but had to go to multiple employees to track down the small appliance sales rep, in order to open the cellphone lock-up.

Side note: it is quite an indictment on our society, the level of "chain of custody" that this phone took in the name of "loss prevention"<//Text>

They were doing some type of inventory shift or something and half the store was more than at the store was practically empty and it wasn't easy to find help it was not the same as it used to be hopefully they'll restock and lower some prices I've been going there for 20 years plus and I've never seen the prices so high with hardly any inventory<//review>

<text>They only price match products sold by Amazon. If it's sold by a third party they will not price match.

Place was a ghost town. Best part is checking out the various fish aquariums. Hate to say it but this place is a victim of Amazon's success.

I've been coming to this Fry's electronics since it opened and I have never had a complaint other than the usual Fry's stuff like watching for open-box items and being smart about your purchases as the staff is usually incentivized to upsell.. however I'm not sure how long this Fry's is going to be here because as of late it really seems like their stock is thinning out and their isles have tons of fillers and repeat items.. this is the reason for my four stars not 5... I do hope they survive but as of right now I'm just not sure.. I still recommend them however don't expect the selection they used to have.. if things turn around I will definitely update my review and increase the star back to 5 😉</review>

To be fully honest, i have had better experiences at Fry’s Electronics. They don’t seem to care about the customers as before and also for their shelves. Way to many empty shelves. When i asked if they had any on stock and they replied with “ no we have been out for a while and i don’t know when we will have any on stock”. Thats a sad thing for an electronics store. Sadly it seems like another “Radio Shack” is about to happen.😕😕</review>

Awesome! Wish I remembered the bubbly blonde woman that helped me over by the stun guns which I had no idea they even sold! Lol. She was amazing tho! Helped me find everything I needed and they were just about to close! Needless to say I actually got everything that I came there for which just so happened to all be on opposite sides of the store! Never would have been able to do it without her! Oh and the guy who was worried about his calculus exam! Hope that you passed! Those two made my day! Thanks for everything!!!<//review>

With the exception of one particularly helpful employee in customer service who assisted me in finding and ensuring the correct device was the one I walked away with, nearly half a dozen other interactions left me with rude or dismissive Associates. Nearly every interaction I had with an employee there was unsatisfactory and unhelpful. I recommend this place only if you know exactly what you need and exactly where to get it otherwise you're on your own.<//Review>

Love this place. It has everything one could want in electronics, TV's and games. The sales staff is informative and kind. The place is lit inside nice and bright with merchandise nicely displayed. Its too bad theyre so pricey, i just go somewhere else to buy it or get it online from Amazon.<//Text>

<date>1495112018227<//date><Rating>5<//Rating><text>If you like computers or gadgets or audio visual stuff or even appliances, Fry's is the place to visit. They always have good sales too. Some are huge bargains. The stuff you see on eBay from China can be found here as well as the main brands. They have many varieties to choose from too. Don't ever go to Best Buy, that place is for suckers who don't mind paying full retail price. Fry's is like buying online (prices) but in-store touch, feel, examine closely and tryout. I just wish they would expand to everywhere.<//text>< Pictures>

Fry's has gradually declined over the years. They used to be the go-to spot for PC parts but now most of the shelves are half stocked. Don't waist your time in this store. You're better off just shopping for it online</review>

The building itself is amazing with the whole "Lost city of Atlantis theme going on".
The employees are very helpful and always smiling, they are attentive to their customers and the stores upkeep. It is very nice to visit this Fry's for almost any thing.
They have a nice little cafe in the center.
The store is pretty big and carries a wide variety of merchandise.
They always have some pretty good sales and clearance in all departments it's great.<//Review>

<text>Huge store, they will have every electronic you can think of. From kitchen appliances,  tvs, computers, and sound systems. They have it all. When I went, their audio room wasn't fully setup so I didn't get to sample as many sound systems that I would have liked. Staff is helpful and everything is reasonably priced.<//text><name>Ryan Zuidema< /name></record></dataset><record>

Customer service is slow here but professional.  Only gave 2 stars because it takes a while to find out if what is on display is actually available.  If you don't have to deal with any assistance then you will enjoy the visit. Fry's has a lot of useful stuff at good prices.</review>

Seems to never be someone in there that can accurately help you find something. Also tends to be out of things constantly. They could easily downsize the floorplan and save so much money!< /Text>

<text>Probably like most Fry's stores they're enormous it's very difficult to find someone to help you the employees seem to have an agenda all of their own and basically ignore you until you seek them out I went in there looking for a printer ink for my Canon printer I had purchased a generic ink in there a few months ago they did not have any and the ink was expensive and they weren't going to order any more of the generic ink so I don't think I'll be going back there< /text>< rate>

Prices seemed fine and they currently match major online sellers. The store really had most everything you could want, but had a very chaotic layout and was huge. All around fun though! I like the large saltwater fish tanks set up throughout.< /Text>

Way better than other Bests out there. Friendly tech help from Robert new guy. Professional and knowledgeable without stringing you along saying if its not this then its this. Stay away from people like that cause you will end up rebuilding when it wasn't necessary. Go Fry's</Text>

<Review>4 star store, 1 star service. Went in to spend ~1100$ on a computer build, knew which pieces I wanted, just had to find them.
An employee was helping a son and father put together their build so when I couldn't find some of the pieces I walked over to 2 other employees, 1 was unloading boxes and another was staring at the computer, so I approached the fat, balding guy at the computer. "Excuse me, sir"... guy doesn't flinch or move, or recognize me in anyway, so I stand there staring at him for a bit waiting for a response: "someone else will help you, unless you have a quick question." So I ask if they're out of a certain kind of motherboard, a pretty quick question in my opinion, and he responds with "yeah someone else will help you."  Then goes back to staring at the computer. Doesn't ask the box guy to help me, doesn't notify the guy helping the father/son that I need help, doesn't call for another employee.
After waiting a few more minutes I asked the employee, who's already busy helping a customer, if theyre out. He tells me if it's not on the shelf, they're out. Not sure why the guy at the computer couldn't say that. Walked right out, I'll spend my money elsewhere if they're not interested in my business.< /Review><username>Will Deuprey< /username><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

Short version -

Great if you're looking for something specific and don't care about the price. Usually has the latest and greatest tech. Certain departments need to be more knowledgeable about their products.

Positives

-Expansive inventory
-Niche PC hardware not carried by other big box stores
-Friendly staff

Negatives

-None competitive pricing
-Old inventory that isn't discounted
-store organization can be lacking

I have had positive, negative, and overall neutral experiences here. In most cases the staff is friendly, but usually uninformed. Staff in the PC gaming department could use some polishing on the latest tech and what is available. On the other hand I have had amazing experiences in the TV department. The store has such a wide variety of items that I can usually find what in looking for or find something I didn't intend on getting. Unfortunately, they are usually not the lowest price wise and that gap is not filled by quality of service. This can also be seen by the items they have in stock. For instance I have seen Razer PC gaming gear that isn't even being made anymore, at prices at the same level as the latest and greatest hardware. I have also had negative experiences here with customer management and store organization. I have seen the San Marcos store in complete disarray before. There was a point where I went to buy a new PC gaming chair and test out the various models they have, but every single one was just being lounged in by out of control kids and various people just screwing around in the chairs.

Not a bad place, but definitely doesn't stand out as my one stop shop.<//text>

Fry's is incredible. I've never seen an electronic store with an Atlantis theme, but it was quite the sight. There are giant fish tanks at the entrance. But they also have what you're looking for. They carry an assortment of electronics and components. We came for materials to build a computer and they had what we needed.</text>

Do yourself a favor and either set an alarm or have someone that is not too much into technology go with you.  When I go to Fry's electronics I get stuck.  With all the new technology, I just have to know what's next.</Text>

The first time I got the email that said my order was ready but when o got there, an item was missing and this time they tried to give me an illusion box item that wasn't even the same product! At least Best Buy checks the item before sending toy the email< /review>< Pictures>

A sad sight. There is almost nothing left in the store, yet it remains open for some strange reason. It is clearly going out of business; stop prolonging the misery and just close the doors.</text>

<Text>I ordered something online and got an email that it was ready to pick up. When I went to pick it up it took about 7 minutes to find the item because someone it just left it on a table instead of on the shelves where items are supposed to be left. It took three people to look for it before they finally found the item.

Normally this wouldn't bother me but I had three co-workers waiting in the car for me to head back from lunch.<//Text>< Pictures>

Return policy on many items is totally shady!!  Bought 3 segways 1 didn't work right out of the box and the store wouldn't take back without a struggle... actually thought they would make me return to manufacturers.   Ridiculous... wouldn't refund me! Only a store credit after selling me broken stuff.   This place is truly the worst on customer service.   No one that works there even looks remotely happy.   In fact they look pissed off or dead.   The whole time I was there I was trailed by 5 or 6 security guards after spending over 2000$ there.   I'll never patronize them again!  Worst store ever I'd rather pay more at a better store that put up with this company who just don't care about the customers!  Thinks every customer is a thief... show your receipt at the door while someone pretends to check the items against the receipts.   Just ridiculous!  Apparently they don't know that just about all loss comes from employees not the customers.   Save your time go elsewhere you will thank me!  I actually felt as if they didn't believe me when I said it didn't work out the box.... mind you all I wanted was to exchange for a working one.   I didn't even want a refund!</text>

Lots of stuff here, beautiful place to shop.  However, the employees are mostly not very friendly nor are they knowledgeable about their products and whereabouts of the products.  The "cafe" is never opened for business the few times we were there.  But, I do like to shop here because they have lots of stuff.<//text>

They fall short in accurately labeling products on the shelf, or having well trained & educated sales staff available when you need them. If self service warehouse shopping works for you, you are set. But if you need guidance or have questions about the product,  you are on your own.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<review>I went to there to buy a karaoke machine. I returned it a week later because it wasn't working properly and I didn't really know what kind of karaoke machine I wanted but I realized that wasn't it.
When I came to return it, such an easy process. It's great to see they wanna make sure what the problem was in the machine, if it's an easy fix instead of having to do a return or store credit, which I ended up doing. Such a easy process on my end and they gave me options on how I'd like my refund.
I got store credit, and now knowing what I was looking for, Ashley was more than helpful. She was the one to help me the first time too. She's very knowledgeable too. I just got the best customer service. All my questions were answered and I went home confident in what I purchased.
Few days later, I definitely made the right choice buying my electronics here.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

This place is a joke. It's like a zombie apocalypse inside. The staff are extremely unhelpful and only there to collect a paycheck. Went in 3 days in a row and every single person I asked had no idea where anything was or could show me. Never got anything I was looking for because they don't have it...but guess what, Amazon does for cheaper. I'll never be coming back to Fry's. So sad to see such a awesome place go so far downhill< /Text>

<text>Sure Fry's is big and impressive, but jeez... I don't think I'll be going back. Half the time I go there it feels like the employees are treating me like I'm an idiot, once I eventually find somebody to help me (the place feels like a ghost town). The chair I purchased a couple of months ago has some of the weakest stitching. My tv will not connect to my WiFi network, my desk was missing a piece and I had to get it replaced (thankfully they did just give me a replacement part from another box. But only after I had dealt with seemingly clueless employees that wanted me to bring the entire thing back after I had assembled the whole thing... A manager offered me the much more sensible solution of swapping out the missing part though). The USB type c cords I purchased don't even conform to the type c standard, as they are not reversible! They don't work if plugged in in one orientation! And the tv stand I bought has a big scratch in it that I am certain wasn't there when I decided to buy it but was there when it arrived via their delivery service (they did give me a discount as it was a floor model, but I wouldn't have purchased it if the scratch was present then).

The only actually good experience I had was when I was buying some RAM and a water cooling kit. The salesperson helped me get matching RAM based on some pictures, which I did greatly appreciate.

Other than that one salesperson that helped me with my RAM purchase, it seems like none of the employees care in the slightest. :c<//text>< Pictures>

Fry's is my comfort place. Unfortunately, it's just not what it used to be. Promo codes are nice, and internet price matching is awesome, but depending on what you're going for, inventory can be pretty slim. Movies have been reduced to 2 barely stocked aisles when it used to be several that were packed. PC parts and components usually has a good selection, but don't get too excited about general media.</Text>

I have to admit I like this store better than the one off Aero Drive since they seem to have what I'm looking for in stock. It might be due to the fact that the Aero Drive store is more central, gets more customers, and thus run out of what I'm going to buy at Fry's. Anyhow, this location sells everything a typical Fry's store sells. There are neat aquariums in the store and a nicer food/snack restaurant, as well. Fry's has good prices that are even better with their promo codes that you get via email when you sign up for free on their website.< /Text>

Awesome store, I can spend hours just walking through this place drooling over all the cool gadgets. The staff can be hard to find at times and just like best buy they tend to talk like experts on things that they know very little about. Return process isn't quite as simple as best buy, but overall I do love this store. If you are worried at all about the reliability of what you are buying them I go to Best Buy to avoid potential issues of return, but they have a huge variety. It's like radio shack meets best buy on steroids. With the exception of their old school DOS based computer system, and outdated horrible websites lol< /Text>

<Text>Not to speculate but seem like either Fry's as a company or at least San Marcos store is going out of business. Most shelves were empty, lot's of empty floor space around the store and I also think way less employees in the store than before.< /Text>< pics>

Fun to  visit. But watch the pricing. It is not always the best price around. A keyboard here was $129, all over the Internet for $60.< /review>

Always a fun place to go nerd out at. Components, computer parts, tvs, desktops, those little gummy orange wedge candies, audio equipment, refrigerators and more. At times, their prices are a touch high, but being able to pick it up on site is a huge convenience and well worth it.< /review>

Four bad experiences here.

There is rarely a reason to purchase something here. Buy on Amazon or another site that has good customer service and an actual return policy.

Be patient. Wait the one to two days for shipping. Do you really need that item TODAY? Do you need it NOW or can you wait a day for peace of mind?

Prepare to wait around for a long time to not be helped also. Prepare for policies that do not match up with the reciept.< /review>

Visited store to look for flatbed scanners. I asked a computer department associate where I could find the flatbed scanners. He looked at me with a glazed over look obviously not knowing what a flatbed scanner was. He pointed to an area across the room towards the printers. Once in the printer area I asked another associate and he also had no clue. I ended up looking myself and eventually found what I needed. Now I remember why I don't shop at Fry's.</review>

A Joke ! Drove from Temecula  to see this thrift store. 90% empty ! Ask the guy if they were shutting down he said no. San Marco's store was location. Maybe Mission Valley store has product.< /Review>

<Text>Tons of electronics from games to household items. They also have a mix of other housewares, car audio and other things. It’s really worth a visit if you’ve never been here before. Would have given five stars but their pricing is not always the most competitive.  Though they do offer internet price matching.</Text>< Pictures>

Fry's always has what I am looking for. But the workers are another story. The checkout person who checks your recipe. Lazy as worker!!!!!!!. We got a huge tv. Which we needed help with to load in the car. I'm a girl and my husband was with me. You do the math. This kids did nothing to help. Just mumbled took his sweet ass time to get up as if it was such a huge inconvenience for him. Sad world we live in</text>

Fry's is my comfort place. Unfortunately, it's just not what it used to be. Promo codes are nice, and internet price matching is awesome, but depending on what you're going for, inventory can be pretty slim. Movies have been reduced to 2 barely stocked aisles when it used to be several that were packed. PC parts and components usually has a good selection, but don't get too excited about general media.< /Text>

< Review>
Absolutely beautiful store with gigantic fish tanks and beautiful architectural features looking like a fancy hotel from Vegas. However no one knew where anything was in the store. I was sent from one side of the gigantic store to the other in order to find outdoor speakers. Each department told me it was in another department. Same thing when I tried to find luggage not one person knew where anything was. It wasn't till a nice young Gentleman on his lunch break physically walked me over there. What should have been a 10-minute trip turned into a 45-minute trip.</Review>

<Text>They match online prices. That means google all your items in your cart. If a lower price exists they will usually honor it. That means any item from a web sale that they stock...I could go get item today without waiting but pay discount online prices. By using this tool I save alot on my tech and supplies. As a developer this is a huge help.</Text>< Pics>

Not different from any of the other locations. Lots of stuff and people to assist you. The entrance looks like an old palace, but everything else is the same. Good parking, and good service.</Text>

I like that they carry almost everything with regards to computer parts and everything else electronic. It's a huge building. I got help immediately and got what I needed and went on my way. I wish they had a store map like Home Depot does so I don't have to wander thru so many aisles just to get to where I need to go. Personally I believe they want us to go thru all the aisles because we would probably grab more great and neat stuff that we dont really need but we have to buy it because it's so cool!</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Lot's of parking.  You can easily get lost at this store, because it is so big.  The kids love the aquarium theme.  They even have a small restaurant inside.  The staff are friendly and the lines go much faster than other electronics store.  You'll often find hard to find items here for your electronics project.  It is also a great place to just browse the latest technology.<//Text></record>

I'm copying this from my Yelp, as it's extensive. Fry's has frustrated me enough, and wasted enough of my time, for me to create and leave a review here:

My experience with the San Marcos store started after black Friday this past year. My husband went to pick up a 60" TV your store had advertised on sale for $500. He went in the morning and bought the TV, to be picked up later that day by both of us, since we lived on the third floor of our apartments at the time. When we returned later that afternoon to pick up our TV, the personnel at the door told us the TV had been paid for and taken, not paid for--to be picked up, like my husband had explicitly requested. They had given him the wrong receipt and while we waited for the management to figure out what they did wrong, we saw his TV in the "waiting to be picked up" portion of the store. With his name on it. The cashier who had made the mistake, never told anyone, so the man who was trying to figure things out looked at us like we were there trying to steal a free TV the entire time, while we were just there trying to pick up our TV and go home.

It took them over an HOUR to rectify this situation, during which we didn't get an explanation, and after which, we didn't even get a simple apology. We wouldn't have even had an explanation if my indignation didn't lead to my requesting to see the manager. The manager helped little, I told him as much, and that his personnel needed training on 1) communication, and 2) customer service. Frustrated, I walked out. When I returned 10 minutes later to pick up the TV with my husband. As we proceeded to walk out the door, after getting our receipt checked by a different person, the original guy runs up behind us and tells us to stop, stop. Now we were being unequivocally treated as thieves, as I can only assume they were discriminating against us because no one else was being treated this way.

I am familiar with discrimination, growing up as a minority. My husband was not, growing up in a heavily Mexican community. This experience deeply hurt him.

After our latest visit to the Fry's store in San Diego (another review), the continual lack of communication, terrible customer service, and training, linked with the discrimination my husband experienced at this store, has cemented that this chain is not worthwhile.< /text>

<Text>This place is the worst. The employees are so rude every time I go in. On multiple occasions I have been ignored while two employees finish their personal conversation. If you ask where something is you will get a finger point and an isle number.

The manager(s) never seems to be around to report anything.
I ask for help and just get a hold on or they just point in a direction,
and don’t get me started on how loud the music is there it’s deafening!
I feel bad because when I do have a question about anything i corner the guys in there computer repair section ... the IT guys are super sweet and always busy, but they will walk me to the  item I need or at least try and get one of the red shirts to help who will eventually just drop me off and leave me to fend for myself again .< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>Four bad experiences here.

There is rarely a reason to purchase something here. Buy on Amazon or another site that has good customer service and an actual return policy.

Be patient. Wait the one to two days for shipping. Do you really need that item TODAY? Do you need it NOW or can you wait a day for peace of mind?

Prepare to wait around for a long time to not be helped also. Prepare for policies that do not match up with the reciept.< /Text>< Pics>

Great selection and cool interior. Sometimes a bit hard to find things, the same item or similar item is in many different places. This said, the store has most things imaginable. A cafe in the middle surrounded by salt water fish, didn't try the food, but very cool.< /Text>

<Review>I've been going to Frys for more than a decade.  Love how each is themed differently.  This location in particular has an Atlantis theme (you know, city under water).

It is still one of my favorite electronic stores, but not the same Frys ut used to be.  Back in the day, stuff was cheap and you could get a really good deal.  Especially during Black Friday.  Now not so much.

Nonetheless, it won"t stop me from shopping here.  Still love the size of the store, the selection of merchandise, and its location.< /Review>< pictures>

The only reason why I gave 5 stars is because of Robert in the computer repair department was really busy and ran over to help me find out what memory card that I needed he was outstanding, the reason why I cane to that department was because Cheryl in the computer parts department would not help me if her life depended on it she told me to get lost, was so mad, then after Robert hooked me uo I had to back to the computer parts department and thank god that Ramses was there, he was phenomenal good job guys and if I ran that store Cheryl eould have already got her walking papers, I would fire her right now< /Text>

Even though they are commission-based, it is so hard to find any help anywhere in the store. But you can find a bunch of Associates talking to each other. I'd go across the street and had to Best Buy if I was in deep need and couldn't wait to go on Amazon<//review>

All the reviews are based on bad experiences with very little Value. Items were out of stock!!! WHAT!?! OUT OF STOCK?!?!? I HAVE NEVER!!!

Like come on people, cut some slack. Yes the employee's are "lack luster" at times but you would be to making minimum wage. I have worked retail and upper management are nothing but slave drivers.

Fry's as a store I have nothing bad to say as I am smart enough not to expect the guys in the store to know everything.

If your looking for a good tech store there is none better for mass stock and choice.< /Review>

When shopping for electronics the first place that comes to mind (at least for me) is Best Buy, however, their service was not all that great and they didn't have nearly all the printers that Fry's had. The first few employees I encountered (I was asking for guidence to where i could find the printers) were not all that friendly. Once I got the my destination, the gentleman who helped my was very knowledgeable and nice. He helped me find what I was looking for (it felt he had listed to what my printing preferences were and all the small details). I ended up buying from Fry's with no hesitation and the gentleman who helped me even price matched it with Amazon. I would be returning to Fry's again.<//text>

I called the store to see how much longer it was going to take to fix my computer (it’s been there since Thursday) as the tech person said it would take 5 days to fix. I was on hold for 45 minutes! I am never going there to purchase anything again. It is unacceptable to have to have to wait that long when on the call it says 3 minutes to answer the call! I am beyond angry.<//Review>

<text>This has to be the biggest store that I have ever been to. You seriously have to walk around a "wrap around," just to get to the checkout cashier. It's like you're at an amusement park line. It certainly has everything you can imagine in there, relating to electronics and other miscellaneous items of course. I took off a star mainly because the options to accessorize my canon dslr were fairly limited, to say the least; which was my whole reason of entering the store in the first place. I will definitely be back. Cheers!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

Very difficult to get assistance and I wasn't the only person trying to get help. Finally, got help, selected the product that was recommended by the Fry's employee only to find when I got home that the product didn't do what I needed. Verified with the products manufacturer.< /Review>

Tired of Fry's saying in the ad "free shipping" then when I go to place the order for Dell (2 in one) 11.6 Touchscreen Chromebook, it will not ship to me and the store shows they have plenty in stock.
Fry's is guilty of false advertising when it comes to "free shipping".
I hate taking the time to research an item only to find out in the middle of the day on the sale (1:30)....Fry's does not keep it's word and as far as I'm concerned guilty of misrepresentation.<//Review>

<Text>My favorite place on earth. I can spend hours roaming around the store. I am like a kid at Toys RUs. The place is huge and carry almost anything you need. Except for cars or mattresses. Place is not as busy as it used to be. In great part thanks to Ebay and Amazon.

Products and prices are great if you sign up for the email discounts. The service on the other hand is just ok. I find it very difficult at times to get help even on big ticket items and feel like the person actually wants to help. I rate it so high just because of price and availability of product.</Text>

For the most part it is a nice place sales staff is friendly and eager to help although some lack knowledge of the product they sale which caused me to make a second trip. What I disliked was neinh made to feel like a thief as I left with them asking to see what's in my bag. One would think that a store that sales electronics would have a better method of dealing with product loss takes away from the whole shopping experience< /Review>

<Text>This has to be the biggest store that I have ever been to. You seriously have to walk around a "wrap around," just to get to the checkout cashier. It's like you're at an amusement park line. It certainly has everything you can imagine in there, relating to electronics and other miscellaneous items of course. I took off a star mainly because the options to accessorize my canon dslr were fairly limited, to say the least; which was my whole reason of entering the store in the first place. I will definitely be back. Cheers!</Text>< Pictures>

I always used to enjoy going to this Fry's location, it was clean, well stocked, and had friendly, knowledgeable and helpful sales associates. Unfortunately, the last two times I have gone to the San Marcos location, the store has been dusty and dirty, the shelves seem largely bare outside of a few sections (they had lots of tv's and cameras), the sales guys huddled together and played games on their phones and were unable to answer my questions. I don't think they were very knowledgeable about their products but seemed to be just slackers looking for a paycheck.

The prices are still fairly competitive, especially considering you don't have to wait for 2-day shipping.< /review>

<name>Chris Taddei</name><text>Hands down the most ignorant sales staff I've ever encountered. If you know what you want you can probably find you here relatively inexpensively but don't expect any help , that is if you can find somebody not on their phone and not horsing around , because they will steer you in the wrong direction. My two cents with 30 years in electronics.<//text><rating>1< /rating>< resp>

It seems like this store is going downhill. Lots of empty pegs in the electronic parts area, store just doesn't seem to have the focus it used to. Whether it's due to online competition or the change from physical to digital media, Frys just seems to be slipping.< /Text>

Wow, after visiting two Fry's today, I'm convinced they are going out of business soon.  Most shelves empty, no computer parts, no computers on display, nothing I was looking for.  They are either investing heavily in online purchases, or they are going out of business.  Don't go to the physical locations unless you are looking for printer cartridges, they had those for some reason, though I don't need them.</Review>

< Review>
Today I traveled to Fry's in San Marcos located roughly 40 miles from my house. I spent over an hour and a half in the store picking out parts for a new PC build, having trouble with in stock items and what not, but understandably that is to be expected especially around this time of year.
After sitting in traffic for well over I was excited to put together my Ryzen 5 1600, among other items. The CPU, apparently the only one of its model they had in stock, was an open box item, which is totally fine as long as it is functional and looks good. Upon opening the box at home I noticed that the CPU was definitely used, and although Fry's notate that they inspect the product before re-selling; the product was covered in residue , missing instructions, and most importantly missing thermal paste. At this point I was tempted to just get some thermal paste from my local Best Buy and be done with it, however, I decided to call Fry's and see if they had any more Ryzen 5 1600's in stock. Prior to heading out another 40 miles to the store I was assured by the employee on the phone that my product was in stock.
I arrived at Fry’s 40 minutes before closing and was informed that my CPU was not actually in stock, or at the very least the employees could not locate it. In an attempt to resolve the situation I asked if Fry’s could either ship a CPU to my house so I would not have to travel another 80 mile round trip or compensate me with thermal paste from the store. Both of my suggestions were rudely denied by the supervisor- even more insulting was the fact that they wanted me to pay for additional thermal paste (the thermal paste that should have been included with my product). After discussing the situation with several other employees they tried to explain to me that because I price-matched the CPU with another retailer they couldn't provide me a tube of thermal paste from their shelves, which makes no sense to me at all. It may seem a little ridiculous that I didn't just give up and buy thermal paste myself, however, the principle of the matter was that it was something that was intended to be included with the product I paid for.
Through a lot incompetency and frankly ridiculous policy, Fry’s managed to consume about 6 hours of my day and tried to tell me that If i didn't utilize their price matching policy they would have conceded. So, for the price of a $3 tube of thermal paste Fry’s lost a long time customer and seeing all the other recent reviews I am assuming that I am not the only one.<//Review>

From phones to tablets, microwaves to lazy boys, along with every electronic doohickey and thingamajig you can imagine. I have to set aside entire weekends when I even think about waking in, cuz I can spend that long just finding things I never seen or heard of nor do I probably need these things, but I want them, oh how i do.
Oh yeah, pretty good prices and stuff too<//Review>

You can never really go wrong with Fry's. They stock everything from surface mount components to big screen TVs and everything in between. It can be a bit difficult to find a sales person at times but that does not take away from they fantastic selections and great prices.< /Text>

I wanted to mention the outstanding customer service I received from a young man named Calvin in the tech department. He went above and beyond to explain to me my options with patience and used terms I could easily understanding. The management was cooperative and I am pleased with the results for my situation. However, if it were not for the assistance of Calvin, I think Fry's would NOT be my choice for electronics.< /review>

The only tech store should use Android pay/apple pay. That said, they do have most of the emergency stuff. Even found a PS/2 keyboard for a console session I needed dearly. If you need it today, they have it. If it can wait, you can get it cheaper online.<//Text>

$3.99 marked $19.99 when I go to checkout!  Went their today to buy bannah plugs. Went threw the selection they had comparing to what I can find on amazon and found some on a peg for $3.99. Brought them to the front to check out and they rang up as $19.99! The cashier goes back with me to check and their where sever still on the peg. Looking around their is no peg for the $19.99 and she tells me that their their by mistake. So I grab an other type also on a peg for 3.99 and we head back to checkout. This set ring up at $9.99! Back to the see what else they have this time with a manager. Check several items that are not on the correct peg, the manager apologizes that so many are wrongly stocked. Frustrated I walk back to the checkout without any bannah plugs. I did my best to support the physical store but without knowing the price so that I can compare prices even on what they have in stock how can that work. I will be buying them on line at least I can compare prices.</Text>

<review>Used to be the go-to place for electronics, however it's fallen apart the past few years. Inventory does't seem to turn around as often, shelves are poorly organized, tech basics are hide to find or not in stock.

<Review>I spent 600 on electric scooters that definitely did not perform as advertised , I tried to bring them back and buy the 200.00 more expensive Segway versions and was told there was nothing they could do for me... really? So you sell me an inferior product, I try to come back and make your mistake of selling junk better by giving you more money and I get told take a hike?!? Give me a break! I’ve spent thousands here and will never spend another dime! While I was at the desk I was harassed by a customer that was in line and didn’t want to wait his turn and employees egged him on!! Seriously the worst customer service I’ve ever had!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Fry's is one of my favorite places to "nerd out". The place is huge and even has a cafe inside if you need to rest. Shop with caution, It's like a Vegas casino in that there are no windows to the outside so you can easily lose track of the time while in there looking at all the goodies.< /review>

<Review>Used to be the go-to place for electronics, however it's fallen apart the past few years. Inventory does't seem to turn around as often, shelves are poorly organized, tech basics are hide to find or not in stock. But hey, they do have a cool Tesla coil looking contraption outside.</Review>< gmap_id>

Sad to see this store becoming an abandoned building due to online commerce. Choices are limited now too, as they maintain low inventories.< /text>

<review>As time has gone on, Fry's customer service and knowledge of their employees has lowered significantly since the early 2000's. The last 3 times I have ordered something online, and headed to the store AFTER receiving the confirmation email that my order was ready (an additional 45 minute trip) they could not find my order, or verify it had been pulled from the shelf. So if you know what you need, and are good with self service, head on down to this Fry's!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

$3.99 marked $19.99 when I go to checkout!  Went their today to buy bannah plugs. Went threw the selection they had comparing to what I can find on amazon and found some on a peg for $3.99. Brought them to the front to check out and they rang up as $19.99! The cashier goes back with me to check and their where sever still on the peg. Looking around their is no peg for the $19.99 and she tells me that their their by mistake. So I grab an other type also on a peg for 3.99 and we head back to checkout. This set ring up at $9.99! Back to the see what else they have this time with a manager. Check several items that are not on the correct peg, the manager apologizes that so many are wrongly stocked. Frustrated I walk back to the checkout without any bannah plugs. I did my best to support the physical store but without knowing the price so that I can compare prices even on what they have in stock how can that work. I will be buying them on line at least I can compare prices.< /Text>

< Review>
Service people don't come up very often to ask for help. The entire store feels dark, it was empty for almost all graphics cards so they are low on stock for almost all graphic's cards. I told one person that we were interested in a computer.  He asked me what my price range was and I told him it was low. We could tell he lost interest right away. He said he would be back later and never returned back.<//Review>

<text>It's a shadow of the former glory that stores like this used to be--thanks internet.  The staff seems a little sad and tends toward the "not knowledgeable" end of the IT spectrum.

Not bad but most of the kids selling have NO knowledge of anything. Most of them look just out of HS. They don't carry many Dell Laptops anymore, so that was disappointing.</text>

Saturday the day AFTER Black Friday I went to Fry's. A man in the check out line was commenting tohis wife as we walked by that 2 1/2 hours in line was crazy and they still had 15-20 people ahead of them. As I turned to walk out I noticed that many of the cash registers had no one there. Frys is set up so there are cash registers on both sides of an island like area yet that whole extra side was stacked with open boxes and appeared to be used for storage in addition to only about 1/2 the registers being used on the normal check out side. Why design a store to accommodate extra check outs in times expected heavy business when they don't use them?< /text>

Their selection is a choice between low end and low end with a big price.  They have become too comfortable to be competitive or innovative in their products. I can get all the same stuff from amazon without the lines or messy aisles.<//review>

Great selection for electronic needs, would always rather go to non chain local electronic stores first as you're basically flipping a coin with finding an employee who will actually help you vs. one who makes ya feel like you're intruding on their time... Like bruh I am your time u at a store and as a customer I'm part of the reason you have a paycheck. But 3 stars bc of selection</Review>

Service here can be a little spotty. Once you find someone to help you, you're likely to get a really good price on what you're looking for, but watch out because, mixed in with a good prices, are lots of items with a hefty price tag. Join their internet ad program for even greater savings on their advertised items where you can really avoid the usual high retail prices charged by others.<//review>

The only tech store should use Android pay/apple pay. That said, they do have most of the emergency stuff. Even found a PS/2 keyboard for a console session I needed dearly. If you need it today, they have it. If it can wait, you can get it cheaper online.</text>

This Fry's Electronics is probably the largest I have seen. There is plenty of selection, and the signs point you to the deals. You can find deals online, but the salesmen here are very helpful if you want to talk to someone.</Text>

Going into the store is a pretty good experience most of the time if you know what you need and don't have to talk to anyone. But don't ever try calling the store unless you are happy with talking to a crappy version siri. Absolutely no way to speak to a living creature  inside that store over the phone.</review>

Not very well organized or well stocked. I came in to get 2 of an item that they showed as in stock online. Someone helped me find it, then I looked in the packages since both were opened to make sure all the pieces were there, and one was missing an important component. I asked the same guy if they have any other similar products and he couldn't answer. He also just left the package on the shelf despite it missing half of it, and being unusable. I also told 2 other people, the cashier and the guy she had go do the pricecheck because it rang up wrong. I had to walk him to the area for the item(as he had no clue what is was or where it was from) , and he took the tag off the shelf for the cashier, but left the incomplete one on the shelf.<//review>

I have been looking at upgrading my TV.  Looked at other retailers and ended up at Fry's. A gentleman named Huy came over to help. He knew everything about the TV's I was looking at. Through his expertise I bought what I wanted plus a sound system, all with a 30 price guarantee. Thanks Huy for guiding me through all the different models!! *****</Review>

<Text>This store is so noisy because of its piped-in music I've literally left baskets full of things and walked out the door- on multiple occasions. Has never helped to complain.

More employees than customers. The place feels deserted and the items they stock are a mix of eclectic electronic components, computers, TV, karaoke machines, laser discs, stuffed animals, drones. Probably the biggest collection of electronics under one roof. Problem is the employees seem to know they are on the verge of being layed off and they act like it. You find them in packs talking to each other, or heading to a break but they are not very interested in the occasional customer that wonders in. It's like they know you will browse and order from Amazon anyway.<//text>

It seems like this electronic retail giant's glory days have been gone long time ago; they simply just cannot compete with Amazon and eBay in terms of pricing and selections.  However, you still can find some interesting stuffs in person as a fun part of "Shopping in Reality".< /text>

Steer clear of this place............It's a large air conditioned building with maybe 5 employees and absolutely NO PRODUCT or MERCHANDISE!!!  Employees are in denial and making excuses for the store being out of EVERYTHING.  K-Mart and SEARS have more assets than this place.  Don't waste your time.  BYE, BYE, Fry's!< /Review>

Horrible Fry's. I called to place a laptop on hold and the sales person told me that I had to put my credit card down, he said it would not be charged. I asked him if he is sure that my card would not be charged and he promised me 100% sure that it would not be charged. I gave my credit card information and he had trouble entering it and wanted me to give him the info again but I told him never mind. After hanging up I get an e-mail with an order confirmation. I check my credit card and it was charged. I called back to resolve the issue and the manager was rude and unwilling to help. He did cancel the order but it took me almost 2 weeks to finally get my money back. I had to call 5 times and talk to the manager trying to get my money back. It was an ordeal. Never again will I buy from this Fry's.< /review>

Good selection of electronics, dish washers and fridges. TVs cameras and more. Massive selection of computer, USB, firewire cables. Large music and video selection. Prices are a bit more than at large box retail stores, BUT staff much more, knowledgeable, on site upgrade installation.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>One of favorite Fry's theme store.  This store has an Atlantis underwater theme with 2 giant Jacobs Ladders guarding the front doors.  All of the items are strategically placed together in the store, so that you do not have to travel a mile around the store (I measured this) to find everything that you're looking for including checking out.

The Pricing is also at the top of the list on affordability and the quality exceeds the price in most cases.< /Review>< Pictures>

Some helpful employees and all the Fry's stuff you expect to see. Thank goodness the poor fish/shark they used to confine in a small tank to be tortured is no longer there. I sure hope it didn't die but was moved somewhere else. I regret not calling attention to it to animal rights groups.</Review>

These guys have everything when it comes to electronics. Not to mention other things like a bistro, paintball guns, hoverboards, furniture, books, and more food. It's a huge store that's fun to just walk around in even if you don't feel like buying anything. So big though that sometimes it's hard to find help.</text>

Came all the way from San Diego just to buy a monitor that was clearly stated in the website as brand new. Upon arrival found out that it was a open box one.

Gave it 2 stars because the staff was very nice and helpful.<//text>

< review>
Bought a previously returned google Chromecast on 12-19 for a slightly reduced price. We were planning to disconnect AT&T U-Verse and switch to YouTube TV, with an older TV, we would need the Chromecast for it. We delayed disconnecting U-Verse and I opened the box a couple weeks later and discovered that the device wasn’t in the box. The holidays were hectic and we went away on vacation. We finally disconnected U-verse on 1-2-19 while away and returned on 1-9. Went to Frye’s on 1-14 to return or even exchange the item. The customer service rep called the manager to explain the situation and the response was that basically they don’t believe me because I didn’t return it sooner, even though the return was within 30 days. The box had the power supply in it. Unbelievable. This tells me that they failed to verify the contents of the box when the Chromecast was returned by the initial purchaser and then they tell a customer who would even be willing to exchange the device for the same item, that they don’t find me credible. I still need the Chromecast with more urgency now that U-verse is disconnected at home but refuse to take my business ever again to Frye’s. I’m heading to Best Buy. This experience was offensive and insulting and only a second-rate retailer would repackage a return without the actual device in it. Thank god for competition and I’m certain my experience is not an anomaly.< /review>

Fry's is one of my favorite places to "nerd out". The place is huge and even has a cafe inside if you need to rest. Shop with caution, It's like a Vegas casino in that there are no windows to the outside so you can easily lose track of the time while in there looking at all the goodies.</Review>

Fantastic! I absolutely love this store. Customer service is great!! I love that Fry's matches Internet prices. So if you find something anywhere, even amazon flash sales, come to frys and they will match thd price. So convenient! They have a great selection of everything electronic and so much more!< /Text>

Huge store. They have it all. Customer service is spotty at times. They claim to match internet pricing by competition. I have tried twice and each time they have an excuse like, that's not a reputable vendor or someother lousy excuse. Return poilcy is pretty easy. Plenty of good parking as a side note.<//Text>

I can't believe the audacity to make up as many excuses to not honor price matching.

Basically when they're at the computers they aren't trying to "price match" they're trying find a reason on the website/competitor page to not give you 100% price match. So not only is it insulting to your intelligence but also a giant waste of time.

If you want a better place to price match, Office Depot of (all places) was very very awesome.<//review>

Sadly it looks as though this Fry's is closing. It looks dead inside. Alot of the shelves are empty. Doesn't look like it will be here in a few months.< /Text>

Wasted time and travel for routinely occurring inventory inaccuracies is extremely annoying. Otherwise, they've got a lot of great stuff.< /review>

<Text>Update, one year later, dropping off yet another star: Don't bother finding anything that is in the sale ad. IF they had any it was few. They are stripping down shelving, thinning out the stock. Obviously going downhill and going by the way of Radio Shack. Soon, there will be almost NO place to walk in and buy the electronic parts I need. A simple USB cable is too much to expect from an electronics store? They had cables in no less than 5 different locations in the store and not the one I needed. It's almost to the point that they need to yank off that bandaid and put itself out of it's misery.
------------------------------------------------------

Original review:
Went to find a sale item. The thing was not on the shelf and I could find no slot where it might go. The worst part is not finding ANY employees in the area to help. I left the store with the security check person yakking away with some other slacker. All I got was Have A Nice Day. An hour of time wasted.

This scenario is very typical of most of my visits. Can't find products, can't find help. Sale items are scattered around the store in illogical locations to force you to run marathons. I don't have time for their games. Makes a person lean more to online shopping.

The San Marcos store is clean, spacious, brightly lit and fun to browse in.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

When I went to dispute it they had me wait for over a hour the 3 times I went in. Just to tell me at the end to call their bank. When I would the bank would tell me to go in store. They kicked me back and forth between the two of them. Terrible service.< /Text><name>Benevolent Elephant</name><userid>105195891905961278346<//userid><rating>2</rating></record></dataset><record>

Don't like Fry's customer service, one time I returned a broken item because it was broken when I bought it and the person at the return counter just packaged it up again and marked it for sale as "open box". That means they will sell it to another customer that then has the same hassle to bring it back as I did.<//text>< Resp>

This store is so noisy because of its piped-in music I've literally left baskets full of things and walked out the door- on multiple occasions. Has never helped to complain. Love their pricing and their promo codes but it's really hard to find things in the store, even for their own staff.< /text>

Good prices and they match internet. I normally carry my phone and search for the item and see if I can get it cheaper. They are always nice about it, but most of the time they have the best price.< /text>

<Review>Been here several times to get things not in stock at my local Fry's. Remember to check stock online before going. The San Marcos store is a very nice looking store with huge aquariums of fish to look at. Which is probably good if you have younger kids that are going with you that need to be entertained. It also probably influenced my experience otherwise would probably be 3 stars. I went for a tiger rice cooker and they did have it in stock. The one and only open box, but I bought it because everything was there and it was unused. I looked around at other small appliances on the aisle and saw generati that we're opened too. Seems to be common problem at Fry's stores because the San Diego store on Stonecrest looks the same. Anyways got what I came for and the only complaint is regarding cashier and cashier supervisor. I tried to pay using Samsung Pay with my debit card to add a few more points to Samsung account. Cashier says I don't think we accept Samsung Pay. I said that I've used it there before and tried to scan. She says it won't work because I didn't push the button. She yells for supervisor who is busy and tells her to wait. She then tries to call someone to ask but they don't answer. I said I'll just try and see if it works. She said we can't do that. Then supervisor yells what do you need to her. She asks the question and supervisor says, no won't work he needs to sign for it. All the while I'm trying to use debit and enter my pin. "Always works" no chip needed. So I had to get my wallet out and use my card. :(
I know pretty petty complaint, but it just confirms why Ama**n continues to gain use over going into a store. With Ai I would have tried to use a type of payment and it works or doesn't and we move on to trying something else. Guess I'll probably give this more thought and edit review later, not sure why it bothered me as much as it did.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Absolutely the worst experience ever. It literally took 30 minutes to check out and then I had to go back in to return something and it took about 20 almost 25 minutes because the person's computer or whatever froze and now I still have to wait 2 to 5 days for the refund to hit my credit card. I will never ever visit any one of their stores again.< /Review></record>

This is the place to go if your primary interest is being left alone to fend for yourself. Bad service is the norm here, in my experience. I only shop here when they are the only local source of products because the service is so consistently mediocre.<//Text>

Unless you're in there all the time, it can be tough to find stuff (we found porn easier than micro sd cards). But always well stocked, and honestly, you could hide in a back corner and live off the food, sleeping bags, electronics, makeup... Its like Wal-Mart with magic the gathering.</Review>

Very large Brick n mortar store. I just wish the employees were a little more proactive in assisting customers. At least they had what I was looking for.</review>

<text>Just spent 45 mins in this store trying to get a new hard drive and a copy of windows. Found the hard drive easy enough, but after asking 3 different people where I could find the windows install disks and drives and getting 3 different answers and going to the place they pointed to only to find nothing close to what I was asking for I gave up and decided to just get the hard drive. Got to the front of the store to pay, and it rang up as almost double what it was labeled on the floor. The sales clerk said the price on the floor required a promo code and a signup for their website. Walked out. Frustrated and wasted my entire lunch break on something that should have taken 10 mins.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Not the type to complain but asked if they had smartwatches. They said yes in the phone department thats it. Walked around looking for the section okay over it hardly any selection unless I missed something.

Picked up some bose headphones went to pay. One cashier and around 10 plus employees behind counter. Waited a good while since the customer ahead had an issue. Waited not even a we will be right with you all kept counting the drawer and others just standing. Finally placed headphones on counter and left. Nothing was said on either end.< /Text>

On the VERY next day 10/09/18, I brought it back in the box with receipt. I DID NOT damage it or even use the TV.  I brought it back to the San Marcos store location and I was treated as if I caused this!!!
I was told I had to file a claim with the manufacturer and was sent home with the broken TV and out almost $1000!  I spoke with two managers and several employees and none were able to do anything!

This is theft! They take money, give faulty product, and turn their back. My relationship is with the store NOT the manufacturer! I haven't even tried the product yet. They sold me a defective unit!

I cannot stand by this policy. It's not the same as the delivery of a vehicle or purchase of a home. There wasn't a delivery check sheet, there wasn't a walk through...their process doesn't support their policy ie signed document saying product received in perfect condition!!

THIS IS FRAUD!!!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

I hate this place. I've come here many time with my family and not once have I found what I was looking for nor did I feel that the employees knew what I was talking about. I usually leave having taught them something they should already know and I'm frustrated. Don't go here!< /Review>

Prices on sale items affordable but the constant following customers, badly pretending to not be following or watching, the cashiers tripping over themselves in an effort to get you out faster and the fake goodbye and hope to see you again soon said with a sneer is just not worth it. They actually congratulate themselves on a made up fantasy robbery that alienates customers and wards of business. I went to DMV at 6 am and they opened at 8 am in san Marcos and by 9 am I was out and thought I had enough anger and stupidly thrown at me for a year, but F actually made me feel that DMV had been the better bad part of the morning!!!</Review><Rating>1< /Rating></record>

I see a lot of negative reviews here so I though I would write something a little more positive.  I have purchased 3 computers at Fry's over the years and have never had a problem.  The last computer was a Lenovo Z710 with 1TB hard drive and 16GB memory which listed for $1599 I found a bargain online for $999.00 and went to Fry's to see if they had it and would match the price.  The had it and they had it on sale for $1350., however they matched the price even though I felt they would rather not.  No hassles.  I have purchased many items from them including a 55" Sony TV which was a current model that I bought for 1/2 the list price on sale.   I have never had a defective product.  I did return an item than I bought by mistake and returned it without any hassle.  I shop at the store in San Marcos, find it clean and well stocked.  Maybe I'm lucky, which I'm not, but find Fry's to be a great place to buy electronics.< /Text>

<Review>Employees are more knowledgeable than Best buy. Products are not as high quality as products you get on Amazon, and are usually more expensive. Don't count on price matching. They will search for the website you show them, then say they can't find it, or it isn't the same thing, when it is. I would recommend Amazon. Better prices and better quality.<//Review>< Pictures>

The store looks pretty cool. Prices are alright, about average. But one thing is they are over employed! I literally say 50 employees and they where all in like a group of 6-8 and just chatting.... And not giving any advice or help.<//Text>

Vastly larger and broader selection than Best Buy, its most comparable competitor. The prices are lower or at least equal to Big Blue, too.<//Text>

<Text>Took 20 minutes to get a very rude associate on the phone, was transferred in a continuous loop, was trying to make a $20,000+ corporate purchase of audio equipment. I just wanted to double check that their online inventory matched what they had.

Great job to the Fry's team. My business has been taken elsewhere.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Horrible customer service!!! My xbox one s is having intermittent problems with video... makes gaming hard.  I bought a $70 2 year warranty from them when I bought the xbox, called in to verify it was valid then drove 40 min to get to the store, but they wouldn't exchange it because after 30 minutes of resetting and restarting the xbox, they got it to work... THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT!! Worst customer service I have had in a very long time.< /Review>

If you see it online, that does not mean they have it. All three products I found online, were not in store. The staff stinks. Prepare to wander around a HUGE store looking. No one was in line but it took forever. Seriously,  forever. They did have a cool fish tank. This is an only if I have to store. I wish I could be positive about my Fry's visit, but why, it is what it is. Good luck.<//Review>< Response>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Great selection of electronics. This store is huge. There is an awkward cafe in the middle of the store. The space is massive and whatever you are looking for you will find it. Plenty of computers and computer accessories, TVs, appliances. The store itself is a little quirky, makes the place worth visiting just to see what it looks like. There are strange underwater type of decorations in the front of the store, as if this store once was something completely different and then transformed into a frys. Unless all frys look like that, I wouldn't know this is the only one I've been to.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Claim they match online prices and that they "won't be beat"  but every site with the lowest price gets you a "sorry we don't price match with them" or "sorry only local stores". Micro Center isn't too far away from here to just drive there and get much better deals. That's what I'll do from now on. I only have 2 stars instead of one because they atleast had what I wanted.<//review>< Pics>

This store is well worth the rage inducing trip down the 15S, from Craig rd to the ***far*** south end of the strip. Amazing prices, staff who have ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE about the products (unlike a certain store with employees in blue shirts) and the giant fish tank makes my heart happy.<//text>

<Review>There inventory and what they actually have don't match. Customer Service wasn't very helpful. Also when asked to call another store to assure that the phone is there an employee laughs and comments on how they won't answer the phone just like them. I don't understand how they can't pick up a phone call when many employees are just standing around doing nothing.< /Review>< pictures>

They have a better selection of portable hard drives than the best buy down the street, and a decent price with the promo code. Downside none of the sales reps asked me if I needed help.<//text>

<review>I've been in the San Marcos CA Frys location a couple times and my experience has been mixed between just ok and not so good. The staff is helpful and asks how they can help. The store is huge but, bigger isn't always better and it feels like they have more shelf space then products. As far this location, it is in dire need of a remodel or update at the least.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

There was no merchandise. The shelves were almost completely empty. I purchased a screen protector for my S8 Note and it was not even close to the right size; for a totally different phone. It said Samsung S8 Note on the front of the box!<//Text>

Fry's Electronics is off the hook but they're going out of business or telling you they're not because that way you will buy an extended warranty on your computer or TV and when they're gone you'll have nowhere to take it too.< /text>

< review>
We went in tonight, 08/01 looking for a program for our desktop computer. It took us several minutes to find anyone working there and when we did ask a young associate, walking around with what seemed to be his buddies, we asked if he was busy. His reply: "a little bit!!" and continued on with the other 3 young men he was walking with.
When we asked another associate where the program we were looking for was, he just pointed in the general direction.
We looked and searched until i literally yelled out to a guy for help. He came over and heeled alot, but out was slit of trouble getting help.
Wish i could say i wouldn't return again, but it's one of a few electronics stores around.< /review>

< Review>
This place is huge, well decorated inside (underwater theme with beautiful fish tanks) and has all the home electronics you could want, plus a bunch of other eclectic items. The staff is typically meh, but have been getting better over the last year or so.
Their pricing is weird, some things have really good prices, but most are a bit high, so you really need to double-check before you buy there.
Last, I HATE the 1000 foot maze they make you walk through to get to a register. Several years ago, they needed that line space, but in the last few years (even during the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas or other big sales holidays) there have only been a few people in line in front of me. They recently took out half of the 50+ registers to make more counter room. I am guessing that they will be going out of business in the next year or so at this rate.</Review>

<Review>Terrible customer service!!!!!! I walked in and immediately asked an associate where to do a return, she directed me to the checkout line. After getting in line, luck would have it that the same associate I originally asked where to go to do my return ended up being my cashier. I handed her my receipt and the item I wished to return and she then stated I have to go another area for returns and the reason I didn’t know that is because the original entrance is closed. I just looked at her and left to stand in another line for 10more minutes. This is one of the reasons I will never purchase from Fryz again.< /Review>< user_name>

<response>None<//response><Review>While Fry's boasts great prices, its selection and customer service are mediocre at best. Internet price matching is great, but finding what you want in stock and getting a person who knows what they're talking about is a chore. My suggestion? Educate yourself in advance, know what you're going for, approach a podium and (possibly wait a few minutes to) ask if they have it in stock.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</gmap_id><time>1379701579287< /time><userid>116038661571906618175</userid>< user_name>

<Text>Horrible employees and management. Customers feel like they are in a car dealership. One of the worst services I had received on a color printer for years. They sold me an open box printer saying all is fine with it. When I tried to return it they charged me for missing parts! And the sales person denied even mentioning to me that this was an open box item.

When i showed them the picture i took of the printer while i was in the store they still refused. Will never step into this store again.<//Text><Response>None< /Response><Name>samadian<//Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

There was no merchandise. The shelves were almost completely empty. I purchased a screen protector for my S8 Note and it was not even close to the right size; for a totally different phone. It said Samsung S8 Note on the front of the box!</text>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Terrible customer service!!!!!! I walked in and immediately asked an associate where to do a return, she directed me to the checkout line. After getting in line, luck would have it that the same associate I originally asked where to go to do my return ended up being my cashier. I handed her my receipt and the item I wished to return and she then stated I have to go another area for returns and the reason I didn’t know that is because the original entrance is closed. I just looked at her and left to stand in another line for 10more minutes. This is one of the reasons I will never purchase from Fryz again.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Looks like they're going out of business.  Hardly any inventory on the shelves.  Said they're getting "a new vendor". We'll see.</Text>

Terrible customer service at checkout! Went in to purchase a car stereo fit kit and wiring harness. Guys in the car electronics department were helpful and found what I was looking for. When checking out and trying to get them to Internet price match, as the sign outside says they do, the cashier disappeared for twenty minutes and then used every excuse not to match the price when she finally returned. Needless to say I did not purchase from Fry's. Items are ordered and expected within two days from Amazon for a savings of over 50%.<//Review>

<Text>Edit: came back after two years, customer service is important when working in electronics. Manufacturing defects do happen on occasion. My folks bought parts for my little brother to build a computer, and I came down to assemble it. Gigabyte board had a bent pin. Decided to simply get an exchange for the same model as we were still within the 30 day window.

Fry's refused to exchange or refund the motherboard. Their policy is that damaged products cannot be returned, even if sold in a damaged state. Caviat Emptor, if you buy from here, check your components before purchasing.< /Text><username>William Barden< /username><GmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9</GmapID>< Resp>

Good place to find pc components and home automation gear. Staff is knowledgeable and helpful. I like supporting local stores and they do price match stuff on the Internet. Don't give it 5 stars because if you've been to their Las Vegas store you'll know why.<//text>

<review>Of the two Frys in San Diego county, this is the nice one.  This one was originally built as a Frys whereas the one in Mission Valley was converted.   As such, the decor in the San Marco's has a theme (Atlantis).

It makes a difference since there is a happier feeling here and the fish tanks are incredible, so your kids will love it.

Frys is the best place to go to look at and touch real goods rather than the internet and they will match any price you pull up on your phone.  The 32" monitor here cost almost $100 less than Amazon and cheaper than anywhere else I could pull up.  So they were already the lowest price.  Give them a try.<//review><rating>5< /rating>< pics>

Great, if not one of the best electronic stores. You can find everything - almost. But the checkout is unreasonably slow and the service is lacking.</review>

It is a big store and they have anything you need, however is very hard to find someone to help you.  The extended warranties on kitchen appliances is waste of my money.  They have contract with cheap local repair shops owned by unqualified individuals and they perform trouble job during the repair.</text>

No customer wifi was really annoying.  Some reasons there is a network void there on ATT and I had to step outside to do any price searching etc.  I went in to get a Switch for my nephew but wanted to check prices etc.  Decided to just buy the Cat 6 cables I came in for and headed to Gamestop for the system instead.< /text>

Employees are nice and helful. For the most part there's a large variety of products. They even have an exercise equipment section. Cool kitchen appliances.  They sell mattresses, kids toys, and as seen on tv products. It's very organized and clean. The repair guys are somewhat helpful but the store doesn't always have the necessary parts. They even have a cafe inside (expensive). Love the ocean themed deco throughout entire store. Prices are decent. Definitely more expensive than walmart but cheaper than Best Buy.<//review>

Worst return department on earth. The computer system that runs this joke of a store is straight out of the 80's, green screen and all. It literally takes 6 minutes to process a return and this is after it takes them 8 minutes to question you and wander around in the back talking to whomever about the return? Zero customer support and complete imbeciles working the return desks. Better off buying anything similar from Costco even if the price is higher because you know without a doubt you can return it without any hassles. These hourly wage earners make you feel like a criminal for returning anything, even with the receipt.</Review>

It is what you would expect from a massive warehouse store. Nothing that great but they have just about everything. They price match also which is really nice.< /text>

We bought high priced items, and asked for them to be brought to the front while we shopped, but they had us waiting for an hour to bring us our items once we had gotten done paying for our items, and they forgot to bring 2 of our 5 items entirely! How can you have someone checking items out, but not make sure that your items are properly given to you as you leave?! We spent too much money to have to drive back, and grab these items after we paid for them. We essentially have bought these items twice now, in gas and having to deal with the stress of moving into our new home, and get home to find that these items are missing! We have a new baby, so this was pretty stressful to have to go the first time, so to have to turn around and grab these things is ridiculous!!!<//text>

The store manager refused to do a price match on a dji Mavic air directly from the dji's website which follows all their official price match policies listed on their website.

The sales accociates (3) were unfamiliar the products and spend more time joking with their collegues than helping costomers.

The store could use a little merchandising

But other than that. Good store. Big product selection.<//Text>

Only reason I go here is to check blu ray price. ... they advertise they meet on line pricing... fail to mention they charge you for them to restock item and use next day air.... even if they have extra of said iui tem on hand... item ends up costing more than what store actually sells it for... if you buy it there< /Text>

Bought computer, HP, and 40 days later, audio wouldn't work.   Got replacement but same problem.  Returned and got a Lenovo.  After 30-day return policy, Frys prorated my 3-year warranty and I lost $40 for no other reason than it was after the 30-day return policy even though it was a bad computer.  I waited too long to start using my computer due to other impending issues.  Never wait, you'll lose money.<//text>

I'd go with 4 or 5 stars for them based on the fact that they have every single thing I need for consumer electronics bits and pieces. I genuinely enjoy the enormous selection of everything I like. I have to cut it back to 3 stars because of a combination of the staff and the processes. It's nearly impossible sometimes to track down anybody in any department except the computer section where they have far too many sales folks with not near enough to do it seems. They don't bother you as much as they used to while you were shopping so I guess that's improved but there are a whole heck of a lot of them.
Procedurally stand in the checkout line for far too long, get charged the incorrect amount for something, tell the cashier on the spot but they can't void the sale, we have to to to returns to get it refunded. This doesn't happen all the time but enough to be irritating.<//Text>

<review>Bought a computer screen goes blue had to replace memory, then the cord stops working had to buy cord. Bought a camera that kept crashing found out it was an old model.
They sell junk at high cost and will not replace it. Small stuff ok to buy, printers chargers.
Cameras computers tablets plan on loss if it's defective. Which is pretty much everything they sell</review>< Pictures>

Awful returns or customer service. Came in to spend several hundred dollars on new printers and couldn't get a $6 refund on still-in-the-package cables with a receipt because it was past 30 days since the purchase. That was because the last time I came in to return the cables, I waited in line for almost an hour and the line hadn't moved. Frys, you just lost my business for good.</text>

<text>After a reciever failed and I took it in to service under their in store extended warranty, it took almost 3 hours to check it in and secure a loaner.  Nobody knew what was going on and the only person who knew how to do a loaner wasn't there.  I just picked up the reciever after 2 months and all the screws in the back were missing, and the volume knob has physical damage.  The associate gave me some screws and a screw driver and we put some spare screws we found in a spare screws bin back in.  He apologized for the damage.  That's just the beginning.  It took 45 minutes for them to figure out how to get the loaner returned and get me the damaged goods back to me.  I get it home and hook it all back up and turn it on, now it says version error.  To sum up my experience: I used to love going to Fry's, now I cringe at the thought of stepping foot in this place.  My wife refuses to return.<//text><time>1512872818650< /time>< user_name>

If you can't wait 2 days for Amazon, Fry's is a great place to put your hands on a variety of merchandise.  If you're in luck you may get a salesperson who knows what they are talking about.<//Review>

Store is a total mess and when I tried to return something well with the restrictions and policy the GM told me I could only get a store credit at best because he couldn't get the return to enter into the computer. Funny that a computer store's GM can be defeated by a computer. What a joke.< /text>

Their return policies have always seemed fair, too.

Only bummer is that their associates must be on commission because they're always hounding me to let them enter things into the computer on the sales floor as their sale, even if I found the item on the shelf without assistance. Actually, I wouldn't mind that if it wasn't so time consuming.< /Review><rate>4</rate><Time>1447960094318</Time>< response>

<text>I buy movies, ink cartridges, video games, ect... I'm a delivery driver in use of a car charger to charger my phone as I work (GPS use) and I bought one at Fry's which only lasted a day until it malfunctioned. I was not allowed to exchange it since it was not in it's original package (probably in a garbage truck by now); this is disappointing and will switch over my electronic needs to Best Buy.</text></record>

<review>I was born and raised in San Diego and have been going to this Fry's as long as I can remember. I have had NO trouble, customer service is friendly and helpful. Huge store but also very organized I know right where to go as soon as I walk in. They have honored all 5 of my returns without a hassle. This is by far my favorite store my only complaint is sometimes all the employees are busy with other customers, which is understandable though. Anyone giving this fry's under 4 stars are surely mentally unstable and should not be trusted! There is also a very cool fish tank with a shark and a few jacob's ladder's.< /review>< rate>

Usually a good Fry's, but sometimes has a tendency to have items go out of stock quicker than other Fry's.<//review>

Reg: 14 Gonzales, Mariel C.

I wanted to let you know that I received great service with a smile form your cashier Mariel Gonzales. She was very courteous and professional. I just wanted you to know that. She will be a great asset to your company. I have my own business, Ariel's furniture Refinishing and Upholstery and I know that good employees are VERY VERY VERY hard to come across.

I hadn't been to your store in a few years and was happy to find everything I was looking for.

I bought a Lenovo Tablet and I am very happy with it.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Took my laptop in for repair. They had it a week to replace the screen. I called them to see if it was done. And I was told they were working on it. And that it was a tough one to do. I knew that it was hard one to install. But the truth finally came out. The guy who was qualified to do the job had quit. And it hadn't been touched. I prepaid for the repair. I had to drive another hour to go pick it up and get a refund. I bought my laptop at fry's. You can bet it won't happen again!< /review>

< review>
As a local Depot, they have a lot of selection, however; they're always out of stock on any deal they present and they always find a reason why they don't price match. Oh, yes, no rain checks on sold out deals either. Funny, their deals are, again, always sold out.

They can't compete with Amazon, Newegg, or Microcenter. You're honestly better off spending your money else where and waiting a couple days to get your merchandise.

My 8700k combo with ram was $800 at frys, and $580 at Microcenter, of course frys wouldn't bend.

Of the home stereo equipment that sell, it's so over priced, you're honestly better off dealing with one of the competitors they supposedly price match but always find a reason not to. When it comes down to it, take your business elsewhere.</review>

Staff seem to have the life sucked out of them.  Seems to load up a bunch of absolute junk at entrance.  Be aware it seems a lot of stock is not the newest version or are returns that have been refurbished.  I get depressed walking through the store.< /Review>

Update 8.28.20. Went in looking for a school laptop, they had two. That's right only 2 laptops. All the display tables empty and so many empty shelves. If you actually need something, go to BestBuy, the chances of fries having something in stock is very low.
Service was not very good or non-existent would be a better description.
I will try to avoid this place in the future.</Text>

It makes it very uncomfortable for people to shop around especially if they classify you as nonwhite. No customer service skill at all. Finally I walk out with one item in hand and the receipt checker proceeds with asking me can you open the box to make sure nothing else is in there. Haven't been here in over 5 years and I will never come here again. I DO NOT RECCOMEND ANYBODY VISITING THIS GHOSTOWN. Last time I step foot in here.

They are always surprising me with deals on things I would never think to by here. I looked for a new coffee maker online and one came up on Google which was for sale from Fry's. Not only was it perfect but it was less expensive by almost $50 from anywhere else.<//review>

I guess if you want something that you used to get at RadioShack you'll now have to go here. Prices are high, help is rare, it's not like it used to be. I can remember the old days when you would walk in and there were one or two attendants trying to Vie for your attention so they could help you find what you needed. Now you will wander down three or four eisles before you will be able to find somebody and they're usually busy with somebody else. They too will probably go out of business as did RadioShack. It's only a matter of time.</Text>

<Review>I have been purchasing products from Fry's for many years. The last experience I had was when my desk top took a dump and I tried to have the item repaired but unfortunately I was not given good customer service when it comes to returns or repairs. I tried to explain to the Asst manager what took place but I was directed elsewhere.  Ask to speak with a store Mgr was denied that .To make things worse I waited for a call from the repair store and the number they had was not valid, after waiting several weeks to check on the status of my desk top, I was advised another 6 weeks before my desktop will be fixed! I will never recommend or purchase any more items from this store. I am very disappointed in their service after being a loyal customer for years. I rather pay extra to receive great customer service, then be given the run around like I have been this past month!!!!!< /Review>< Response>

Waited 20 minutes for a return then asked a few more questions before he had to leave again. In the end they didn't have any of the computers I looked at in stock (invintory issue). They did offer 5% off. Went home and purchased same laptop from amazon for $400 less, so I guess it was a good thing! Sorry Frys but you lost an easy $1500 bucks. Won't be back.

Fry's has recently been doing a pretty good job with their pricing lately and the items that they carry are generally very competitive to what you find online. This particular store could probably use some de-cluttering, but then it wouldn't be Fry's :)< /Text>

<Text>My issue with frys was a very surprising one I bought an air conditional unit from the store getting home I couldn't install the unite because the part to install the unit will not fit my living room window I returned the unite I was told that I cannot return and any open air conditioner they called the manager he confirmed what  I told before I try to explain my situation to him but he refused, he now exchange the unit with other one  in the box I told him that the air conditioner is useless to me because it will not fit my window, this  unit cost me 468 dollars, I told the employee that  will be my last time in frys  I can't believe this in 2015 I can’t return an item that I bought in less than 48hrs. My best store to shop is Costco or Sams club.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><Rate>1< /Rate><user_name>omo owen<//user_name>< time>

Super clean store and easy to navigate through. The service here is much better than the frys down in Mission Valley. They actually have people there to help you that know what they are talking about. If your ever in the need for a variety of electronic options. Frys usually always has the best deals.< /Review>

Great place to shop for pc parts. I hate ordering parts online and then end up with a wrong or nonworking component. Frys had almost everything I need in stock and beats the prices at Anson and newegg (plus a few other places). I would of given 5 stars, but the laptop aisle is something to avoid. If you're looking for a laptop, do your research and know what you want before you go in. Those vultures in the laptop department give a great store a bad name.<//Text>

<Review>I recently stopped by to pick up a gift here. I was furious with the service that was given, we had been standing there for 10-15mins waiting for some assistance and NOT one person came up to greet us to offer help. Shortly a couple had walked up to take a look at the same product we were buying and was greeted in an instant. The guy was told by the couple that they had wanted to purchase that item and he walked away without even bothering to ask if we needed anything, making it obvious that he did not want to help us.. Sucks because my boyfriend had mention to the sales man to grab one for us too. I work in commission as well and I know well I will never judge someone by appearance or make any customer feel unnoticed. He was lucky we even gave him the commission, I was tempted to just ask a different sales person.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Definitely won't be shopping here again. I ordered Beats Solo 3 from their website on Nov 17 and was told that it was available in store for pick up with purchase online. I decided to do it, went in the store, they proceeded to tell me that I needed to order it in store as a special reserve and it would be delivered to the store for pick up in two weeks but it would be charged on the card now. So I did it...

Well, over 1 month later I have no eta and just keep getting told it's on backorder. I guess the worst part is when I called to check, they tried pushing me off saying they'll call me later and don't even ask for my phone number to call me back with. I called the rep out, he acted like he had it, never got a callback.

I learned never to shop with Frys and I'll stick with the more reputable storefronts when needed.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Frys is a good electronics store but in the past years I have been stiffed on rebates not being honored.
When I complained to store they say to contact the manufacturer and the manufacturer says contact the store, because this is not there product.
Problem remains unresolved but it's happen on five different occasions, only at Frys and I have not had this problem any where else ever.
I don't do rebates at Frys, I know,slow learner.< /text>

This is the WORST frys store ever

The staff is rude and unknowledgeable in almost every department.  They constantly guess at the answer to a question even when they have no idea what you're talking about.

In December I had to go through the returns process 4 different times  due to multiple defective products and getting incorrect product info from the staff.

The only employee who did give me false info was Dennis.  He was too lazy to even give me the wrong answer.  He simply invited me to look online and walked away to his break or something.</Text>

Went there expecting great deals. NOT!  The prices was average. Lots of items advertised specials. But no deals. This place is only for people who build computers.<//Text>

< Review>
I purchased an item on-line for store pickup in San Marcos, CA store.  When I got there they didn't have item in stock and provided very slow, abysmal customer service.  Wasted 45 minutes of my time.  Will never shop at this deadbeat store again.  Amazon is so much better than dealing with these highly unmotivated employees.< /Review>

< Review>
The worst experience of my life. I bought two laptops for work for over 500 dollars each from a sales rep and manager named Qi. Less than two months later the laptops hard drives start making a loud grinding noise and  Frys own tech support informs me both hard drives have gone bad and is very noticeable due to the light being on and the horrendous sounds the hard drive was making. Tech support was very friendly and knowledgeable and the best part about frys. When I went to customer service for an exchange customer service rep named Mayra was unfriendly, unwelcoming and even annoyed that we needed her help. She was even amused as she knew they were not going to help us in anyway. Then the same person who sold me the laptops named Qi said they could not exchange it or refund and tech support can not fix it. So basically I'm out over 1000 dollars and the manager above Qi did not even have the decency to talk to me face to face. I can't believe they are selling these overpriced laptops that break down and offer no help. I would give zero stars if I could and I advise everyone to go get your electronics and Best Buy or any other place that will actually take care of you. Please buyers beware.<//Review>

Wide selection on many types of electronics and parts.  Fry's used to be the place to go for the best prices, but now they just sell everything at the full retail price and price match Amazon and others only we requested by the customer.</Review>

I can honestly say I will NEVER step foot again in a FRY's store again.  They have the worst customer service.  Need I say more?  If I pay more elsewhere, it will be worth every dime.  They totally do not know how to treat a customer and keep the customer coming back.<//review>

They do not match internet prices like their giant sign says. They only marsh a few sites and only when fulfilled by that site. Forget about Amazon and Newegg.<//text>

Wide selection on many types of electronics and parts.  Fry's used to be the place to go for the best prices, but now they just sell everything at the full retail price and price match Amazon and others only we requested by the customer.<//Review>

<review>I stopped here at 9:30 AM, but they don't even open until 10:00.  I'll just go shop on Amazon.  You can't sell if you don't open until lunch.  Amazon is sure to be putting these people out of business soon.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dc755aa2b28be1:0x51e22e4c135aeec9<//GmapID></record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><user_name>Eric Sebastian Rodriguez< /user_name><Date>1492898984045< /Date><text>I will do my best to summarize this. I bought a motherboard with a 2 year warranty 6 months ago. I finally have all the parts i need to build my computer. I realize i bought the wrong motheboard for my components. I called and their staff said the manager would understand especially since i have the warranty. I came in immediately was turned down by Laura the manager of the returns and exchange section. She was rude and i attempted to keep it pleasant as I was hoping to have an easy exchange. I eas sent to Richard(Very nice guy and informative) from Components section. He was willing to help and also thought the manager Gaetano Ventrella would understand and help me out. The product was checked out before my upgrade exchange was approved due to the fact that everything was still sealed. After a final inspection their was show of pin damage(I bought this new and sealed). When realizing this he had to double check with the manager again. The manager came over and said he now can not approve of the upgrade exchange.  I asked him to please reconsider as i spend a lot of money here, planning to buy yet another 4k tv from your location  and am about to spend 150.00 more then my original purchase for the right motherboard. He said he is not willing to lose 200.00. I saw that he was unwilling to help me out so i asked to utilize my 2 year warranty and exchange for a new one and ill have to sell on my own i suppose. He said he can not exchange my motherboard because its damaged. I asked him to please reconsider because he himself saw and his employee noticed that the packagings inside were sealed and i now bought defective item from you. He said he can't help me unless I buy the 4k tv from him now and the new motherboard. I felt so angry at that point i told him i was done and id be contacting corporate (end).  This was very unprofessional and unwise as I and my many friends, have been respectful and loyal customers for this location for the past 3 years. I have never had to return an item here but have always purchased the warranties. I will never again visit this location. I will be writing a letter to corporate in hopes they contact me. If they can resolve this issue i will be glad to take my business to alternatr frys location. I will gladly drive and spend the extra gas to avoid doing business with Gaetano Ventrella. If their is no resolution I will ensure to let all i know to stay away from this location as i have already discouraged my close friends to cease and desist from going and spending money at this location.</text><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>I frequently buy from Frys (I build computers and enjoy high end headphones). Product selection is subpar (half of what Amazon has if you are willing to wait for shipping), and the customer service is TERRIBLE. I mean T E R R I B L E. Every encounter I have had with a rep (Atleast 25-30 times) has been a bad experience, and all though they are quick to help, they are extremely rude and condescending, or have no knowledge on the topic you may be asking for. I have left Frys feeling bad about myself because of an employee more times then not. Overall, 2 stars for the product selection, and -7 stars for customer service. Boo.<//review>< user_id>

A Great place to work but not so great to work there. Most electronic items are offered with a discount price. You can also get some technical help about items that you are buying.</Text>

Probably final review: The shelves really are nearly, or actually empty now. Really sad to see the chain go, but apparently all Fry's are like this. Best Buy is a bit of a joke. I guess all we have left is the Microcenter in Tustin to be the entire state's one good computer component store? Holy cow.

New review: It's a sad day for me indeed, but my once five star rating is now a one star. Since December this location has not replenished it's stock at all. Most of the shelves are FILLED with either large boxes they used to keep in the warehouse area, or with very cheap products that I assume other Fry's locations couldn't sell. It leaves me to speculate, either they are preparing for a big remodel and didn't want to fill up on stock, or what I think is more likely: this location is probably preparing to go out of business. They selection has become such a joke otherwise. Items advertised they not only are out of, but haven't had at this location since November. There is barely anything to browse anymore, they're just missing so much product. It's a really sad state, and downright frustrating to try to find stuff you need here now. If they get their stock back, I'll put my rating back to 5 stars. But at this moment, this doesn't even feel like a Fry's anymore.

Original review: I don't know why so many people are complaining about the service here. Most electronics stores I go to, the staff has no idea what I'm talking about. At Fry's about half the staff actually knows what they're talking about, and honestly that is impressive.
Selection is really good, and among all the Fry's electronics I've been (six of them) this is probably the largest/easiest to navigate.

I know some people prefer the employee going to you, but I hate being asked by every employee at Best Buy if I need help. I don't want to answer the same question every ten seconds. I would much rather go to the employee once I figure out what my question IS. And this is what you can do at Fry's.

To reiterate: If you NEED HELP just go ask them! I don't see why everyone reviewing this fry's seems to want some employee to just follow them through the store. That sounds more annoying, especially when if you bother to ask them a question, they are very friendly!<//text>

<rate>3</rate><Review>I have known and loved Frys for years. Shopped there when they were mostly components to build your own projects or computers.
First NEVER buy returns or opened box items. Having done this and gotten a bad device more than once I will never do it again. Someone probably bought it and either didn't like it, broke it or found it didn't work right, the item was returned, put back in the box, and back on the shelf. They do not inspect returns.
Second They have a big selection more than almost any others
Third Price matching is spotty. I have gotten price matches but I didn't get a match on a Samsung 32GB SDRAM because the online model had an A at the end. The package was identical etc.but still no match.
Fourth employees are not specially trained so don't expect to get difficult questions answered. They know about as much (or a slightly less) than employees in any dept. store.
Fifth  it is one of the few places where you can still walk in and buy components. That won't matter to many but it makes a difference to some of us when we need one more chip, transistor or cap.
So I consider Frys a mixed bag. But still go in once a week.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

What a HOAX!!!  The Sunday ad CLEARLY said that this "my Cloud  1TB was available online and instore with FREE shipping.

I placed the item in my cart and found...."instore ONLY".  Well they just lost this sale and since I was
REQUIRED TO SIGN UP FOR THEIR E-MAIL ADS,the first one I get will be PERMANENTLY blocked.  It is called "bait and switch".  Bye, Bye...No buy at Fry's</review>

Online order did not go through for in store pick up even though it said it was processing my order. As a result it took me an extra hour and a half to get the thing I wanted. Partly because I couldn't find anyone in the store to ask a question.< /text>

< review>
Store manager Gaetano Ventrella will not make any accommodations to return faulty product.  Frys did not disclose that the manufacturer of the $2800 TV we purchased voided the 1 year warranty because our receipt said "open box".   Frys told us this TV was new and not to worry about the "open box".  We did not receive any discount for the "open box" at the time of purchase.  We now have a $2800 tv that does not work at 8 months old.  Frys will not return and Samsung will not repair.< /review>

Always walk to the back of the store, Price's are cheaper the further you are from the entrance.  USB car adapter, by the entrance 9-12 bucks, back by car audio 3-6 bucks.. I'm just saying.</text>

In the heyday of the PC boom, Fry's was a busy center of activity. When I last went in the store, it appeared to have half of the merchandise it used to carry, and felt like a ghost town.</text>

Can't seem to get a hold of anyone on the phone.  Went in and the line for service was only 3 people long including me but I didn't get helped for 30 min.  Finally left my laptop in there and now I can't get a hold of anyone.  Poor service for sure.</Review>

Great selection and good prices - but if there are only 5 people in the whole store, they'll shut down enough registers to ensure your wait to leave is still 10 minutes, haha.</Text>

<Review>For the most part grrat place for deals on electronics. Sales people can a bit of just a job attitude. Some times have a real problem with restocking. Not uncommon to walk down a asile and see whole sections of price tags and empty pegs.</Review>< gmap_id>

The first 2 times I asked for help I was just pointed in a direction and not always correct !!! Then I had the associate actually walk over to help me find the item and was able to find a different model number then I was told the first time that would work for me !!! But spent over 40 mns looking in several finger pointing directions until I asked the associate to come find it for me ! That's when he was able to look up the item a second time and help me out . What should have been a 10 minute visit took almost an hour because of lack of attention by the staff !!!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Some of the staff at Frys know there stuff, others are dumber then mud fences. I bought a computer from the sales man and unboxed and set it up. Found out the guy sold me the wrong computer (desktop didn't have built in WIFI). So I went back a little upset and asked to return the item. Got a knowledgeable sales man and asked to upgrade my 799.99$ computer to a really nice 1499.99$ gaming computer. We look on the internet and find an awesome deal for 1399.99$ no tax. Sales guy says lets do it, I'm going to get my manager. Manger Fabian Toledo comes over and says no he can't do it. But he can do 1250.00 and I pay taxes. Roughly 1360.00$ after taxes. Im like deal. Fabian then says wait. (Guy has no idea how to do math) I made a mistake. I say okay, lets just honor the 1399.99$ price match. He fights with me for 45min over 32$. In the end Fabian Toledo was rude and called me"dog" (guess he thinks we live in the hood) and never honored my price match.

MORAL of the story: NEVER DEAL WITH FABIAN TOLEDO!!! He's rude, angered, and has not passed 3rd grade mathematics. Feel sorry for someone that loses a 1400.00$ sale over 31-32 dollars.<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>This store has a massive selection of products but finding an associate to help you find what you need is quite difficult.  I spent half an hour searching for a wireless charger for my phone and not once was I approached to see if I needed help.  When I finally decided to find someone for help I spent another ten minutes looking for an associate.  Once I found one I was told they didn't carry what I needed.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>In store support is excellent, however, if you call and want the option to wait for the next available service representative, you could wait for 20 minutes as I did one time, or at another time, shortly before closing, I finally got a representative and was immediately disconnected.

<Text>Well I shop at frys very regularly but every time we go in and buy something the item on the shelf never matches the price tag. Why should it be my job to get on my hands and knees and search numbers to match up the tags. Then when I look around groups of sales people are standing around talking. They need to get it together.<//Text>< pictures>

They have everything related to electronics. I found a few products here that other electronic stores do not carry. Employees are a little rude though and did not let me test a product (mouse) before buying.< /Text>

Picked up some resistors and LEDs. Not many places other than Fry's that you can run it and get stuff like that.</Review>

Customer Service Sucks, employees can't be bothered to help you. Understaffed.   Every time I go here I tell myself I'm not going back.   I was going to buy $50 in memory for my computer and a cell phone charger but got rude service so I just left.  This place is going out of business soon I'm sure because of their stupidity.<//review>

< review>
Last week I saw a ad online for a TV, checked the San Marcos store and it showed "all items available", drove from Temecula to San Marcos only to find they're sold out. The salesperson then checks his computer and says they have 3 in the San Diego store, so I drive to San Diego and they're sold out. Yesterday I was looking for a computer monitor, found it "available" in San Diego, paid for it online for store pickup. 30 minutes later I get an email saying "item not available". I've had it with Frys, maybe they could get Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble to improve they're online shopping service.<//review>

< Review>
Customer Service Sucks, employees can't be bothered to help you. Understaffed.   Every time I go here I tell myself I'm not going back.   I was going to buy $50 in memory for my computer and a cell phone charger but got rude service so I just left.  This place is going out of business soon I'm sure because of their stupidity.</Review>

Last week I saw a ad online for a TV, checked the San Marcos store and it showed "all items available", drove from Temecula to San Marcos only to find they're sold out. The salesperson then checks his computer and says they have 3 in the San Diego store, so I drive to San Diego and they're sold out. Yesterday I was looking for a computer monitor, found it "available" in San Diego, paid for it online for store pickup. 30 minutes later I get an email saying "item not available". I've had it with Frys, maybe they could get Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble to improve they're online shopping service.</Text>

Nothing good, have an unfixed TV for 5 months now and my warranty is active-they have shitty customer service and only seem to like it when you pay but hovering agreements they know nothing about-reason why frys is always an unpleasant place to make a business transaction-for all TV buyers out there, do not buy a tv from here because all you will get when it breaks down is a bunch of phone numbers and no one answering<//Review>

Short story; Tried to purchase a $900 graphics card, had to wait three weeks and was lied to on multiple occasions on when one might get in. Stay away. One star is too much.< /Review>

It can be difficult to find what you are looking for and the sales people are generally not helpful but there is no better place for picking up those random bits for engineering or computing purposes when you can't wait for shipment.< /text>

<Text>This store is huge, with many items that one would not expect to find..There is a cafe in its center with huge aquariums in several places..The prices are much better than other stores like it.Very nice place, but it was difficult to find answers from staff,and one gentleman was distinctly grouchy and unwilling to walk to to the area or discuss our options for purchase..</Text>< user_name>

<Text>(Translated by Google) What can I say about Fry's, which is my favorite shop, have comparable prices with Amazon. In Fry's they equal any advertised price.

They have a wide variety of music products, electronics, PCs, home including washing machines and home appliances.

Here you will find any device that you will hardly find in any retail store.

They have promotions every day and they really have very attractive prices.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Bad service, they did not want the guarantee to be valid since in my opinion the manager or supervisor did not listen to my problem, she reckoned that it was a hit on the TV that I bought but in reality they did not sell a damaged product since from the beginning they I installed my tv it was turned off until I stopped doing it, the tv lasted a few months and they did not want to apply the guarantee that I bought them. BEST BUY from experience is better to apply the refund guarantees.

(Original)
Mal servicio, no quisieron ser valida la garantia ya que en mi opinion la gerente o supervisora no escucho mi problema, ella se ensaño con que era un golpe en la tv que compre pero en realidad ne vendieron un producto dañado ya que desde un inicio que instale mi tv se apagaba hasta que dejo de hacerlo, la tv me duro unos meses y no quisieron aplicar la garantia que les compre. BEST BUY por experiencia es mejor para aplicar las garsntias de devolución.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rate>
