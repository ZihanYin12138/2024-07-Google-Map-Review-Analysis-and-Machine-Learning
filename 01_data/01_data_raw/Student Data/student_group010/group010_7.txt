<review>I love this office, they treat you with love and kindness.  You will not find a better person to clean your teeth than Cheri.  I have been going to her 20+ years. Anytime you have a question about billing or insurance the billing staff are on top of it and if they do not know the answer they will find out the answer.  I also love my dentist Dr Reiach.  He is very kind and gentle and explains everything that he is doing.  All around best staff ever!  I would give them 100 stars!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Dr. Mike Holm has been my dentist 2/3 of my life and at 60 I have never had a bad experience. Sherry the hygienist is the most pleasant person and is great at her job, I would recommend them to my family and friends.< /Review>

<Review>Dr Holm and his staff are the BEST! Patient, caring, gentle, do their best to get you in quickly if there is any problems and just wonderful. I give them my highest recommendations. And, I travel 35 min to see them (one way)! Although there are other dentists available closer, I am happy to go! My Hygenist Cherie is also wonderful!</Review>< pics>

American River Dental has filled my needs for many years. Always excellent friendly help. Crowns, fillings, cleanings, x-rays always top notch. I’m one who doesn’t numb very well but Dr. Riach takes the extra time and effort to make it as painless for me as possible and he’s good at it! Karen always does a top notch job with my hygiene and makes sure it’s a completely comfortable experience too!<//Text>

<text>I'll admit with Covid, I think twice about anywhere I go these days.  However, I have been going to this office (Dr Acheson) for more than 20 years.  Even before Covid they did an excellent job of cleanliness.  They really practice every Covid precaution from masks to extra cleaning.  It is really nice to see them clean every station after every patient.  On a general note, before coming to this office, I always doubted dentists who told you you needed every procedure under the sun.  I TRUST Dr Acheson's opinion and feel he is not trying to push service on you.  He states the facts and explains the situation completely.  I would also be remiss if I didn't mention their excellent Hygienists.  You rarely see turnover in staff at this office.  Cheryl and Sherri are the best Hygienists you could ask for.  They are gentle but thorough, friendly, and empathetic.  If you are on the fence and need dental work during this time, don't be afraid of this office.  They will do everything right.  There may not be guarantees these days but being in pain is not helping your immune system either.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Been a patient for years & stay because of the great service I get. I like the way the entire office staff works together to help provide you with excellent dental care all the time. If your personal doc & techs are not available when you need them, one of the others step in to take care of you. That's service!</text>

They're the best; professional, patient, and up-to-date regarding all phases of dentistry.  I am a coward when it comes to dental procedures.  Karen (Hygienist) and Dr. M. Holm are extremely accommodating with my dental issues; e.g., low-pain threshold, gag reflex, etc.<//text>

Dr. Holm and his staff have taken amazing care of my mouth for about 20 yrs. I have had a number of oral surgeries, and Dr. Holm is excellent with the needle and IV sedation. It is so worth it, and the halcion before to help me relax. They have provided emergency weekend care to my bestie when she had an issue. They are kind and efficient. Wouldn't want anyone else managing my mouth. ❤<//review>

<text>Everyone at American River Dental are so nice. I wanted to get upper teeth implants and looked around only to find out I couldnt afford them. Everyone wanted around $27,000 just for the top teeth. I was so disappointed! Well I went to American River Dental for one last try and met Dr. Holms. He told me about a good alternative to implants they had available. I told him I didnt want dentures that would fall when I laugh or eat certain things and didnt want to use adhesive everyday yuk! I didnt want the gag reflex problem of a plastic pallet. He said how about snap in teeth? What? They put 2 stud type posts where my eye teeth are and the teeth have a fastener that snaps the teeth in securely. No glue no pallet!! And then said it would run around $10,000. Well if they stay in tight and arent like conventional dentures I feel that's even better than implants. You can still take them out if needed. I was excited but nervous at the same time. I told him I didnt like the dentist due to bad experiences and I'm a mess in a dental chair. He then told me about the option of anesthesia. I thought what could be more perfect. I cant stand needles in my mouth I'm very sensitive in my mouth and he was going to pull 7 teeth. The procedures were pain free and I got temp teeth now so I didnt give it a five star till my final outcome. It will be a five no doubt. Dr. Holmes and his assistant are kind caring people and never thought I'd say that about any Dentist. Try them out if you need a dentist. You wont be disappointed!</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Every time I go to American River dental it is a wonderful experience. From the hygienist, to my dentist (Dr. Holm), It is always friendly and professional. I’ve been a patient there for close to 40 years… That makes me really old, but also capable of making a very thorough and experienced recommendation. My cleanings, dentistry, root canals, braces...all done competently, painlessly and professionally.< /Text>

<review>I have bee coming to American Dental for 17 years.  Dr Holmes and my hygienist, Karan, are beyond amazing.  Before coming here, I had had so many bad experiences with dentists.  Due to this fear, I ended up neglecting my teeth.  Then the pain had gotten so bad I had to do something about it.  I was so fortunate to have found Dr Holmes.  He has the best bedside manner of any dentist I have ever known, he is never in a hurry, he has such a calming presence, and so much compassion. On top of that, he is a great dentist.   I just can't say enough good about him (and Karan).  I have a zero fear about going to the dentist.  LOVE LOVE this place.  I would give it 10 stars if I could. 😁</review>< rate>

I absolutely love American River Dental. I've been coming here since i was a young child and am now almost 30 years old. I've moved mulitple times but never switched at any other dentist. I am more than happy to drive out of my way to continue to go here. Cheri is amazing and makes me feel at ease. The staff has always been friendly and accommodating as well.</review>

I am a 10-year long patient, and have moved out of the area, but I still make the drive here twice a year because they always provide first-rate dental care. The friendly hygienists do expert, high quality work. My dentist, Dr Holm, has been fixing me up for the past 10 years and his experience, expertise and technique has freed me from all the anxiety of pain that I had experienced from prior, lesser dentists. I actually enjoy going for my routine cleanings and am never afraid of the drill. I am glad I found American River Dental!< /Text>

<Text>In my experience the folks here are pretty much the best. I moved here form the Bay Area about 15 years ago, and needed a dentist. A friend referred me here and I love it. I see Dr. Acheson and he is pretty much the best dentist I have ever found. He is former military dentist/dental surgeon and he handled business. He does everything. You need orthodontia? You need dentures? He can handle pretty much everything, which is nice because you never have to go see another dentist for those services, he's got you covered, all at one office. He is also extremely knowledgeable and has the best bed side manners. I love it here and have referred many family and friends.< /Text>< rating>

From my Grandmother: "I met Dr. John Riach of American River Dental in the early 2000's. We got to discussing my reproach of dental work. He explained that they could put me to sleep to do the dental work. I made an appointment to have the work done, and when I went to pay my bill I was told, "It wasn't as much as I was quoted." The reason being, the anesthetic they were originally going to use was not going to work and the one that they did use was less expensive. Had they not told me, I would have never known the difference. That convinced me that American River Dental and Dr. Riach are extremely reputable. I am still a happy patient to this day."<//text>

< review>
My wife has had extractions and fillings, and I just finished my first two extractions.  This dental team is prompt, friendly and professional.  We both had Dr.  Riach, and both praise his skill and sensitivity.  Sooo different from my previous experiences of dental work!  The front desk is friendly and know their business, also.   This is a legit. and unsolicited review.
...
A few years later...have had 5 appointments, and all consistently very good.  I should add that among the dentists and assistants there is an efficient friendliness...no tension...further puts the patient at ease.

A.R.D. is my "home away from home!" I consider Dr. Holm to be not only a superb dentist but a true "artist" in his field. He has done extensive reconstructive work on my teeth, and the results are magnificent. He is quite personable, and makes the patient feel at ease. He is sensibly conservative in his assessment of patient needs, painstakingly thorough, and a good communicator: responsive to patient queries and generously  taking time to carefully explain procedures. The staff are all extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. It is a pleasure knowing them all, and knowing that I am the recipient of top-notch professional dental care.<//Review>

I cannot speak highly enough about the service and professionalism at American River Dental. I have been a patient there for over 10 years. The staff, technicians and Dr. Riach provide stellar service. From their friendly office staff and ease of scheduling to their skilled hygienists and calming dentists, this is by far the best dental practice in the area. Their commitment to staying current with technology and dental advancements is evident in their offerings and how they run their business. Six years ago, I moved out of the area and tried to find another dentist / hygienist. Nothing could match the comfort, trust and skill of the folks at American River Dental. I continue to make the trip to Rancho Cordova for my dental needs twice a year.<//text>

<text>I've had to come into American River Dental a lot lately, more so than I've ever had to before. I have to say that the staff here is beyond amazing. Normally I have to sit for a few minutes before I see the Dr, which gives me time to breathe before my appointment. I have to say that their waiting area is so comfortable and relaxing; it easily eases my fear right out the door. While I'm in the waiting room, I can hear the girls up front talking to other patients and they show so much care and professionalism. It amazes me that they treat each patient as if they are family. I've had personal experience with all 3 front office girls whether it be by phone or in person, and each one of them has taken their time to explain to me how their office works and explaining to me when my Dr is in and who I should speak to that would give me the best information for my needs. Plus, the back hygiene schedulers are so friendly!! I could rant and rave all day long about the customer service here, but I won't I'll just make it easy ..... ARD makes me feel comfortable! Seriously, it's like a second home to me and I wouldn't have it any other way. I love the ARD staff and can't wait to come in!! Thanks for your service ARD (: You're the best!< /text></record>

I turn into a baby when I get in the chair, but now that it is over, I am so thankful that I did! Dr. Holm and his assistants, Terry and Katy, are absolutely wonderful! Dr. Holm is very thorough when explaining what he is going to do, best of all, the shots didn't hurt a bit! It's good being able to have work done, confident in the treatment that is being done, yet cared enough about to get that extra TLC I needed just to get me through the appointment. Dr. Holm is an artist in his craft, and I am so lucky to have found him to get me back on track. I'm actually looking forward to my next appointment now! The fears are hopefully a thing of the past, and I recommend him with 100% confidence. What a wonderful and caring staff.< /review>< rating>

I went to Dr. Holm because of the excellent reviews he had on yelp and he definitely exceeded my expectations.  Great bedside manner, he took the time to explain everything to me so I understood, and does amazing work. I had an orthodontist chip my front tooth a while ago..it wasnt too bad but i noticed and I was worried something bad would happen to the tooth and it would look worse. Dr holm placed some filling material (forgot the official name of it..lol) and it looks sooooo much better..he shaped it perfectly and the color matches my teeth.. spot on! Even i can't tell some of its not my natural tooth. I went to Sheri the hygienist today and she's amazing too.<//Text>

I have been a patient of American River Dental since about 2007; Dr. Michael Holm, has been my dentist since the day I had my first visit. Dr. Holm is exceptional; both professionally and personally! I have always felt comfortable and have had the utmost trust in him!  I know how important this is; as many people have an overwhelming fear when it comes to seeing a dentist. I can tell you from not only a patient perspective; but professionally as well (I worked as a Registered Dental Assistant) and I  would highly reccommend American River Dental.  Sheri, has been my hygienst since becoming a patient. She is gentle but very thorough! I have right and left full joint replacements in my jaw due to Severe TMJ/TMD,  They have been amazing completing my dental work and working with my medical diagnosis.  Anytime I have had a procedure whether it's an exam, cleaning, filling, etc. staff have always offered me pillows,  bite block to take pressure off jaw, drink of water, etc. to make sure I am as comfortable as possible. I have always really  appreciated how caring they genuinely are!! I personally have never heard a negative comment or upset patient in all these years; this says alot!  Thank you Dr. Holm, Sheri, Terry, Monica and all the staff for all the wonderful things you do!  I can not tell you how much I appreciate everything!!<//Text>

After over a decade of excellent dental care by Dr. Riach and Sheila, I continue to entrust my dental health to the professional and friendly staff at American River Dental.  From routine cleanings to complicated root canals, American River Dental consistently exceeds my expectations.</review>

A great place to great fun stuff under five dollars! Its a cross between Claire's, Dollar Tree & a toy store. Quality items from toys, srasonal decorations to appeal & make up candy, birthday cards and more.
Staff here are always friendly and helpful. Plenty of parking and handicap parking also. Good area with other shops and restaurants around it.</Text>

<review>Organized, well-lit, and clean. There's a great selection of basic art supplies, candies/snacks, toys for kids, and t-shirts. Not every item is well-made or worth more than $1, but with many interesting items in one place, it makes for a nice shopping experience. The employees always greet customers upon entry, provide help when needed, and have a friendly type of can-do attitude.</review>< Pics>

It's okay sometimes when you call and ask they say that there isn't stuff from there is but then when there is stuff what you're looking for it's never there does kind of flip flop</review>

Found items long time not seen anywhere else.
Price $5 under, but some over priced. Well, business must be profitable, therefore balance must be fitting customers, but business owners as well. 👍< /review><UserId.>112084134316541152587</UserId.>< rating>

They follow you around so much that it's pathetic . F. Y . I  it's rude to stare and crowd around customers who are shopping with their children it's also pretty rude to have a snotty attitude when I ask for help because your impression of me was that I was a theif, I didn't get any help until after I paid for my items was on my way out<//Review>

<Review>This place is ideal for picking up gifts or just finding random deals on simple or off-brand items like Sink the Ship game, which is Battleship with non-trademarked pieces. Bought some gifts and a few magnets!</Review>< time>

< Review>
This store is cool for kids. Give them $10 bucks & let them have some fun. It just an upscale dollar store with cheapy products. So many toys which I guess would be good for those on a budget for Christmas. But thats about it. 2 stars for a clean appealing store but thats about it. Nothing to bring me back.</Review>

Liked the store, its was pretty clean and just like the name says everything was 5 and below. Didnt like that the bathroom needed a pin and the employee didnt give it to me instead went to punch it in himself.< /Review>

I went into Five Below for my very first time and was impressed at the variety of product's that are $5 and under.
The staff is very friendly and helpful.
I went in just to check it out and see what the store had to offer and found something I needed and made a purchase.
I'll be going back for more!<//text>

Excellent pricing and variety to choose from. Staff was very accommodating to our needs and didn't break our wallet on this trip. That being said I hope the trend continues on my next visit.< /review>

Between your online ordering system, knowledgeable staff on the phone, and prompt delivery...you’ve made my initial exposure and experiences very easy and comforting.  Highly recommend and will be a loyal customer.< /review>

<Review>Perfect example of why you should never have your security guard bud tend. If you don’t like your job that isn’t my bad. Good prices on bulk small nugs but the only strain worth it is the San Fernando OG. Don’t call it that or there might be confusion. Just ask for the SFV small flowers. If they are out then you should probably move on. The strain they developed “Night Cap” is identical to a 1990’s genetic called “Hash Plant” which was known for its natural mold resistant properties and it’s incredible potential for a bigger harvest than any other strain of that era.  Perfume, tastes nice unless you know what Hash Plant is. Basically just a money maker. Flowers a ton but tests low traditionally.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80db02d71fad6541:0xb36f4cee806314ba< /gmapID></record>

<Text>I call for delivery and someone on the phone tells me what they need for delivery info.

I tell them I need to call back in just a second with my info.

I called a not even a mutine later the guy on the phone tells me the delivery driver won’t be back for hours and It won’t happen today.

I’ve been here before but this is my first delivery experience with them.

It wasn’t a great experience.<//Text>< pics>

Wonderful service and phenomenal prices. We are from a different area and came in here and was astounded to see the prices . Jamin has phenomenal customer service and guided me to what I was going to purchase. I intended on buying one item and left with 9 because the prices were phenomenal . Thank you again and when I’m in the area I’ll be back</text>

Traveling from out of state and stumbled upon this gem of a store. The staff is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and down right cool. Destiny draws me here every time I come back to the area. A big shout out to Flor, whose friendly and positive vibe helped assist with me my purchase. Thank you!<//Review>

What a pleasure! I'm a wheelchair user (polio survivor). Edibles really help me sleep. Litza was wonderfully informed and helpful. I love the INDIVIDUALIZED service (professional and personal), the cleanliness, the parking, the access. Thank you all for your needed service. It helps so many!< /Review>

I took back a $3.00 pipe that didn't sit right. Keot falling over . was never used. Her claimed it was used , bought it b4 closing .i went to work got off at 12. Still in the bad with reciept. He claimed it was used. It had a mark from sticker..i hope a 3 dollar pipe was worth looking my business and everyone else I know.</Review>

<Review>This place is conveniently located right off the road with well lit parking in back (for those you who are coming here at night and might feel a little uncomfortable) also you can park beside the building.  All products are put away behind glass and they pull out sample bottles of whatever is it you want to look at.  There are many different varieties of products here from candy to clones. The only two things I didn't care for was the price (pretty high) and that they allow many people in the room where you get the product.  This makes things awkward because there are more customers than employees so you have to wait a while for them to finish with the customers. Even then you better get the employees attention before the guy who came in after you. I had a very nice young guy helping me. I wanted to try a top shelf ($60 1/8), and "medium" shelf product ($45 1/8)and they were OK, would I buy it again? Probably not. But overall I would say I would go back to try what the cheaper stuff is like . The staff are good.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Sort of "green" - new.  , But Jordan was incredible with us. (Erik was not too shabby either)    She took her time and made sure to explain what is what and how.  Of course I have sampled a bit by now, and cant remember much of it. But yes, we will go back and highly recommend this  place.

+Pharma is a great place for all your cannabis needs. My bud-tenders Jamin & Gavin know their products & helped me find what I needed & what I wanted. I purchased a CBD balm for my neuropathy & noticed immediate relief. They are also a lot of fun to talk to & made sure we maximized our discounts.< /Review>

{'time': 1517767432813, 'text': 'The industry is changing due to State Regulations, we did not impose the taxes, we just collect it according to state rules. There is no tax savings regardless if Medical or Adult Use. The Only savings a Medical patient may obtain is if the patient is issued a County Medical card which means you have agreed to register to a government data base is Sales Tax. This savings was available prior to January and the State did not change this opportunity. We agree the taxes now imposed on the industry are too high but we can not change or break these rules. Green Cross Pharma as a courtesy to our loyal Medical patients applies a 10% discount to help you with the tax burden.\n\nEdit Add: Adam, you are very correct. The state with their taxes definitely fuels the black market. On a side note, please be careful going to the unincorporated areas where shops are. Those shops are illegal and you risk being arrested by county sheriffs dept. if caught purchasing at these illegal shops.'}<//Resp>

They CHOSE to do Medical and Recreational, so now if you're Medical and purchase in there, you're spending almost double it seems b/c of higher prices and outrageous taxes, on top of taxes. If they REALLY cared about us Medical Patients who aren't using Cannabis as a "recreational drug", they would have never started selling recreational. PERIOD! They don't care about us Medical Patients, they just want the most money possible. Typical, money hungry liars in the industry! Somewhere else will simply get my business, which is a lot of business!! BAD CHOICE, Green Pharma!! Shame on you guys!!

EDIT: I read what you wrote. And I simply go to an unincorporated area and pay NO taxes, or very, very little. I pay what I used to. Tell the state they are a joke and fueling the Black Market. What a ripoff everything is when you can grow it and make it by yourself...for free.</review><pics>None< /pics>< gmap_id>

i just moved to california this past weekend and wanted to check out a dispensary in my hood. ended up at green cross (thanks google!) where i had the great pleasure of meeting litza. she was very friendly, knowledgeable about the products they have, and was able to help me find exactly what i needed. after learning i was new to the area, she also offered me suggestions on town activities. i will definitely be going back here. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</text>

<Text>Good day to all you patients & care givers!  This is an alert for all of you to take a good look at your dispensary.  I thought I knew it all and had it all until I went to Green Cross Pharma.  Now my needs are met on every level & I now leave my clinic with money in my wallet.  So to all of you who want to see good prices, excellent product & Great service, go to Green Cross Pharma and see what you have been missing.

God Bless the team there.       P.S. Don't forget to tip!!!

<text>Compared to the dispensaries I have been to Green cross pharma is very low class and lacks customer service as well as good deals

The first time i tried to come to the dispensary i pushed the buzzer and NOBODY CAME TO THE DOOR after a couple min i went to call them from the parking lot. Whoever answered the phone was rude and unprofessional, said she didn't see a car in the lot or anyone at the door or hear the buzzer  i was the only car and probably customer at that time ....so i went to my goto dispensary OSD (organic solutions of the desert)
I went again with a friend wgile they were having am advertisement event ....i was rushed my first time of purchasing. I should not feel rushed ....also people lack on their knowledge of marijuana and cannabis products<//text>< GmapID>

Absolutely stunned, first time ever in a dispensary and the wait room service was polite, quick an professional. The Bud-tender Litza was fantasic she explained the deals they had going on and even had patience as I had to get more $$. The bud was exceptionally fantastic for my get away trip. I'm glad all other shops were closed cause I am only shopping here.<//review>

As someone coming from NY and new at this I was pleasantly surprised at how clean, friendly and knowledgeable the staff was. Especially Flor who helped answer some questions I had regarding CBD for my chronic shoulder pains. Never made me feel uncomfortable even though I’m sure my “greenness” probably showed.  Although I don’t have much to compare to, the prices were good.< /text>

... it looks great inside. The budtenders are really friendly, very knowledgeable, and ready to help with anything they can.

They also have great prices, great products, good hours, and a nice selection from inexpensive to top shelf.

Green Cross Pharma has become my go-to place. Full Stars!

Costumer service was horrible, one staff left in the middle of my sale n didn't know much about the products they were selling, the one that replaced her was even worse didn't even give eye contact... First time I've experienced bad costumer service at a place that should be ppl friendly.</review>

(Translated by Google) I had a case with them and since I had an accident and could not work I could no longer pay and because I was three installments late, they told me they could no longer represent me and of $ 3,500 they only returned $ 500 to me arguing that they were going to figure out how much They would return me and charge for appointments that I had not even gone knowing that I was in poor health, they took all that money from me and I don't really recommend it. I had a bad experience with them.

Yo tenía un caso con ellos y como tube un accidente y  no pude trabajar ya no pude pagar y porque tenia un atrazo de tres cuotas ellos me dijeron ya no podrían representarme y de 3,500 dólares solo me devolvieron 500 dólares argumentando que iban hacer cuenta de cuánto me devolverían y cobraron citas que yo nisiquiera había ido sabiendo que yo estaba mal de salud  me quitaron todo ese dinero y no isie er on nada  la verdad no lo recomiendo .👎pase una mala experiencia .con ellos</review>

<Text>I have had the same dentist for the last 20+ years.  But I was rudely surprised when I found out that my insurance wouldn't be accepted for a dental implant.

I looked for a nearby dentist who would accept my insurance.  It was a complete PLEASURE to have found and worked with Dr. Strother and his practice.  The patience, communication, and explanations of the process were a welcome difference from other practices, and my procedure was completed with no problems or issues.

I highly recommend Dr. Strother.  His professionalism, patience, and communication make his a wonderful practitioner.< /Text>< rating>

Dr. Strother is the best dentist, caring and professional. He would take time on holiday to see me in his office to make sure I am ok. He always focus on what is the best for his patients, and never recommend any unnecessary treatments. I feel so lucky to find him.< /Review>

It's like Cheers, where everybody knows your name....I really enjoyed going to get my teeth cleaned here.  Dr. Britton is a very personable dentist and as most dentist offices are becoming, this one is modern with flat screens in front of every chair.  Their service is quick, the faces pleasant, and just an overall wonderful environment.  Thanks Doc<//Review>

Friendly Staff, but that is just fake. The dentists will keep telling you to do the unnecessary treatment. I was told to have three cavities to fill. But I went there, they told me I had 5 cavities. I let them do the treatment on me, later I had headache caused by the filling area . They told me they only did 4 filling on me and did not do the fill on that teeth. And that Asian male dentist treated me like I am a fraud. He was very rude and treated the patient like animals. He should not be a dentist for people. He should be a dentist for lions. Stay away from this crazy Asian dentist and this place!</review>

Having recently needing a cleaning and exam and being new in town, a friend recommended LaJolla Dental  and Dr Strother. The atmosphere was inviting and the hygienist performed expertly and my teeth have never been whiter.  I also opted for a teeth alignment service. I felt comfortable being there and their care for me was evident. I will continue to use their services. Highly recommended!!< /review>

<text>Dr. Kajian and Dr. Azimi are meticulous in their treatment and approach. In my experience with dentistry, a lot of dentists tend to be very sloppy with their work. Dr. Kajian and Azimi take their time with each patient to ensure you're comfortable, you understand what's happening with your treatment, and you're not left in the dark. I appreciate a doctor that takes their time instead of rushing to get to the next appointment. It's hard to trust someone with your teeth, but I'm never worried when I'm in the care of these docs.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dc06ce92cf41df:0xfb72630b59bb21cb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Don't waste your time and money here. This place is a scam.

I had horrible experience with them. They gave me a long list of treatments they suggest me to do one week ago, and it will be a thousands of dollars bill if I accept all the treatments. so I scheduled a consultation with Dr. Dao and hoping that he would answer me a few questions about the procedure. Before the consultation they called me a few times and said the doctor happened to free that day and they wanted me to accept the treatment at the same time. I said no, I want to talk to my doctor first and then make my decisions. However, when I got there, there was no such consultation service at all. Dr. Dao just simply looked at my tooth and was going to do the treatment. I said again that I was just there for a consultation and he walked away immediately.
Apparently they were trying to push the expensive treatments without my permission ahead of time. I think this of behavior is very unprofessional and dishonest. And Dr. Dao, my time is as precious as yours. I just hope that nobody else will ever waste their time and money there.<//text>

<Review>I'm always amazed at the wide selection of prints and textures. I was looking for oil cloth (which I found), but was also engraved e by this beautiful tropical cotton print. The selection is so wide is definitely worth a visit. Right now due to covid-19 they are requiring masks, sanitizing of hands, and have limited folx at a time.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjsGZ0ChtIK5s7M-VSL8sCGI8jAKKYXzDFz_Xe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCkejHIq8P85DLyy1lmvnviyv69VQwmach_K-7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Best little quick-stop fabric shop for fun, cheap finds--so many options in the $2-$6/yd range. Small selection but the inventory at this little locally owned store changes often so it's worth visiting frequently. Mostly synthetics, but always a few linen gems at great prices and always a selection of very affordable dupioni silk in a range of beautiful colors. Great stretch lace selection--fabric and trims, cheap zippers, notion, fasteners, and rhinestone trim of all kinds. Occasional leather scrap.<//Review>

I Love this place! The staff is always very nice and helpful. I've been going here for years and will continue to be a loyal customer. The selection is small although they are introducing new fashion forward products, but is definitely a good place to shop for the basics. And the prices are very competitive and fair. I definitely recommend this establishment for what it is they have to offer.< /review>

<Review>This is a great spot for basics. Not a ton of selection on fabric but a good selection of notions. A lot of formal wear options. Wouldn’t recommend for quilting.

<review>I think the prices are great, and they have a good selection. They also sell 60 inch wide fabric, which is nice. Good selection of Notions as well. The owner is very helpful.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Date>

I have been going here for years and the ladies are always so nice,  helpful and honest. The prices are very fair and competitive. Definitely recommend this establishment for anyone looking for the basics of fabrics, notions and (industrial) sewing machine accessories.</text>

I just found this place and the prices were amazing. They even had faux fur which I have been hunting for.  The lady who I think was the owner was super helpful and informative. Helped me find everything I needed. This is my go to place now.<//Review>

Asked for helped to find a fabric, they just pointed where it was at. Asked if they had more colors and rudely answered no. Will not be coming back here.

Horrible. I asked for window fabric and they gave me tablecloth fabric. Now they won’t let me return it. I called them and they hung up at me after explaining everything.</Text>

They also have ribbon, velcro, elastic, buttons, lace, decorative bling and other finishing edges. I think they have a seamstress on site but I've never used that service. They don't have every type of fabric but they do get great random canvas/cotton prints in.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Horrible service
Made a 6pm appointment. They were not on time.
Over 30 min late.
lady was rude unprofessional she said sorry too bad
I don’t have nail tech available.
Well you knew in advance that I had an  appointment
Then you should have called In advance to tell me there would be a delay.
Don’t come here.<//Text>

<Review>This is the only nail spot I will go to. Not only are they clean and professional, but their quality is outstanding. The whole place is bright and upbeat. The owners are polite and accommodating, and all of the nail techs are great. My personal favorite so far is Anthony. I haven't had time to get my nails done lately and I had the SNS dip, these nails have been on for 4 weeks now, none broke or chipped, it's great!</Review><rating>5<//rating></record></dataset><record>

Updating my review!!! So I’ve been going to chrome nail bar for along time! Probably 3 years now and they just keep getting better and better! They are loving, caring! And they do whatever they can to make you feel special! We all need to feel loved and wanted and chrome nail bar does that and more! I highly recommend and i will never go anywhere else ! 😍<//Review>

A really nice and clean salon. My nail tech was so nice and really helpful. They were pretty quick as well. She also added on a little design and did it just like the picture I showed. Reasonable prices. $27 for a gel manicure. Design was about $8< /review>

<rating>3<//rating><review>By far the best looking nails for me. Loved my look when I left.  Here comes the but.. When I got to the register I was charged all kinds of fees I'm not used to that included shaping fee, trimming fee. I rather see this fee all included in full set price. When I asked to explain other charges I didn't understand until receptionists came in. So be prepared to pay from 65 to 80 for full set not including tip.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

They accommodated me as a walk in these Covid times. My nails turned out EXACTLY how I wanted them. The place is well lit and spacious and they had plenty of precautions in place as well as they spaced out well.<//Text>

Love the various color options they carry for dip powder. It’s very clean, the have a custodian on site keeping everything tidy. Also, their scents for the scrubs they offer smell amazing!</Text>

They are both amazing and gentle. They are quick, efficient and friendly. They genuinely care for me as a client and ask me about my life and keep up with current events I've got going on. That's just the personal touch the staff have at this nail boutique. I see them religiously every 2 weeks. This place is my go to and I dont plan on ever going elsewhere.

This place is open on Sundays!
Have worked in a couple times and wait no longer than 25 minutes!
they offer complimentary drinks but most of the time you have to ask for it they don't offer them!
Other than that Sleek modern look and good place!<//text>

<review>I went because I loved the way my sister's nails came out ? So I was like I want to try this place out . Decided to go . It's a really nice place service was great. But I paid a good amount of price to get my nails done . I got them done by Lee . It was around closing time . And felt she was rushing. Also they looked nice. So didn't think there would be something wrong. The next day I can see my nails and was not satisfied. They are bumpy!! Also been on for only four days and already looks if I need to get them done again. I won't be going back ....< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I booked a couple services online once I got there the person I chose was double booked... I'd strongly suggest you book over the phone & not online because you'll have the same problem. I had to wait about 30 mins b4 being seated for my pedi. The guy that set me up was nice he got the the water ready & offered a drink menu. I spent about $80+ (nails dipped/ fairy dust & hologram) pedi was $25. 1 finger nail was thicker than the rest but for the most part, I like how everything came out. I feel they should've offered something additional for the inconvenience of the appointment but they just apologized.</Review>

Very clean environment. Very friendly staff. My nails started lifting not even 48 hours after getting them done. I called and complained… They offered to fix them but I did not return< /Review>

It was my first time here today getting the SNS/dip nail powder service! I have long natural nails and wanted something stronger than gel without getting an acrylic overlay, and something to fix a cracked thumbnail and pinky nail without have to go back to short nubs! I am pretty satisfied with the end result, my left thumbnail is a little lumpy and my nail tech (Judy) accidentally cut off too much skin on my left pointer finger which left it a little bloody. Overall I think I will come back.<//review>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>I loved it here. I'm on my 3rd week with my nails I need a fill just haven't had time and they still look good.  Took me forever to find a place that I'd like there every nice here. A little pricey but worth it can't go wrong with the complimentary mimousa.

Quick update so I did go for my fill and honestly I was disappointed no mimousa no water no nothing was offered totally different from the first time,4 same lady by the way. It looked like she was pissed and in a hurry. One of my nails broke 4days after and I didn't even feel it. I thought I found my my place nope. It should feel welcomed each time. It was busy everyone was with someone but I was the only one waiting. As soon as more people came in the faster she did mine. I was trying to tell her they weren't straight and she acted like she didn't understand.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I got my nails done and 2 days later I had popped bubbles all over my nails and they looked all dirty. I went back and they “fixed” them, I left with them looking worse than when I got there. Lots of bubbles on my thumb nail and now they look all fat and lumpy cause they didn’t file the gel off correctly before. She just painted over them again. They were rude when I got there saying they couldn’t see the bubbles and then they said it’s a light color so it’s normal for it to get dirty. I understand light colors get dirty but I had a bunch of bubbles all over my nails it was the gel polish. I’m very disappointed because they’re not cheap either. I won’t be going back.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dd29ba975ead29:0x3b7ac3f0a8c9042</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>I was very disappointed.  I know you get what you pay for.  I moved back out to California and needed to find a eyelash extension place.  The one I was going to in Michigan since 2013 was excellent.  Also during my vacations in California I would use Lucy's eyelashes in Huntington Beach.  Since I was moving here again I wanted a place to go to closer to my home.  I tried Chrome Nail last Thursday.  I was advised to stay away from water around my eyes for 24 hours. I did 48 hrs. After having four years experience wearing them I'm very careful and usually do not need a fill until the third week.
Today is Monday.  Less than three days later the extended lashes are gone.  This is terrible.< /text><name>Victoria Kovar< /name><time>1501636936427<//time></record></dataset><record>

I like this place. I was going to my other nail spot for over 5 years, but they've just been lately a little disappointing.  Then I read about this place.  I like it so far, I like that I have the choice to have a mimosa or some water.<//text>

Charged me $550.20 up front not even on the day of my root canal and then the day of wanted me to sign forms with amounts that were blank, not just for the root canal, but for medicine too. You wouldn't sign a blank check, so why would I sign forms that were not already filled out. Very suspicious, so I asked for a refund.</text>

Went specifically to get loose implants repaired after calling and enquiring if they could help. After being x-rayed and a dentist poking around and loosening the implants even more I was told that the person that deals with them is only in once a month so left in a worse situation than when I went in. Do not recommend</Review>

<text>Went in for a cleaning and first time patient xrays. Cleaning was great but the amount of up-sell and pressure was heavy handed. I get it. Everyone should get a deep cleaning but asking me if I wanted to negotiate my co-pay was tacky and then having me sign a waiver to prove i declined it was overkill. The clinic is dated and needs its own deep cleaning.< /text>< date>

<review>Hi. This is a pleasant place to be, even though it's (shudder) a dental office. Everyone from the front desk to the treatment chair is kind, easygoing, and thoroughly professional in every way as they move you through diagnostics and care. They're great communicators and have inspired me to up my game after a lifetime of thinking my good old brush and floss routine was doing the job. It may sound odd, but my teeth and gums feel more alive and my exams show a much happier mouth. Cheers!<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Was hoping for a follow-up after spending an hour and half in the dentist chair. Been in a bit of pain ever since.
Have received several texts and emails regarding my experience, and confirming my appointment. A bit much.
Dr Marc was very confident and I believe did a good job on my crown and filling.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I was so pleasantly surprised to stumble across SPD, as I was blindly trying to find a new dentist for my son and I. We had a bad experience when we first moved here, so I was weary about our chances, as I was also trying to find a dentist that would take my insurance.
Everyone there was polite, professional and communicated very clearly. The work was thorough and precise, and the environment was comfortable and clean.
Very happy with Sunset Plaza Dental!</review>

Unethical sheisters.  I come in with extreme pain, that from experience I assume is infection and root canal.  The tell me our endodontist is not here till next week, but we think you have a gum infection take this mouth wash come back next week and well reexamine you.  I suffer for a few days in intense pain when someone ethical would have referred me to an emergency endodontist to treat the tooth.  I took care of it elsewhere and will never return to this place look elsewhere for someone who doesn't let people needlessly suffer to make a few bucks.</text>

<review>Drunken noodles are usually brown in color and savory. Krua's recipe more closely akin to Pad Thai. It's red in color,  sweet/chili/vinegar flavor. It's nothing like I thought it would be.
I was disappointed and didn't finish my meal.</review></record>

<Review>I got the pad Thai and I must say it was very tasty. I went with the high heat level and let me tell you they make it hot! It was very hot but very good. I really enjoyed the flavor and the taste was really good. You can tell everything was very fresh and made to order. I will definitely go back and try this place again.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Krua Thai Chula Vista you are most certainly outstanding, I had a lovely experience here today. I love their ambience. Every single thing we had here was outstanding. Team are extremely helpful and service is really fast. The service was terrific, and I will certainly repeat Krua Thai Chula Vista when in the area.< /Review><UserId.>109001365449371637993< /UserId.></record>

The mock duck is amazing. Every dish I've had there is awesome. It's best to order there & wait 10-15 minutes for your food. I ordered online once & it delayed it. Thai coffee & tea is great. Service is wonderful. Desserts are fabulous. Shop at the smoke shop next door while waiting for food!<//Review>

Excellent Thai food. My husband had his favorite green curry with chicken. I had stir fry. The prices are good. Parking is an issue as mentioned in other reviews.< /Text>

This is a small, cozy restaurant that does dine in and takeout. There is a parking lot out front.

We came here for lunch and everything was great. The lunch includes a salad, soup, egg roll and wonton that are all vegetarian friendly. The Pad Thai, Pad See Ewe, Panang curry, and drunken noodles were all delicious. Be wary of the spice, level seven was super hot for a spicy food fan.< /Review>

<Review>We ordered a couple of dishes for our Valentine dinner and it was below par in my opinion.  I’ve had better Thai food.
Dish 1) Salmon fried rice
Dish2) Pineapple fried rice
Dish3) Pa Cha Talay
Dish 4) Stir fry egg plant
Dish 5) Pad Thai
Dish 6) soon noodles

The only dish I enjoyed was the PadTalay and the STIR FRY Egg plants. The other dishes were bland and dry.
Pineapple fried rice is my favorite but not from Krua Thai.  I have no idea what ingredients they put in but it had some yellow curry paste in it.
We ordered 2 of each dish and were not able to finish even half of the food because it was so bland.
Besides the food, Grubhub was an hour late as well.
When our order was placed , ETA was 7:20 pm and our food was not delivered until 8:50 pm.
Wish I hadn’t tipped anyone on my credit card.. Lol</Review>< Pics>

<Text>This place would have gotten a 5 alone for the food!!!

The only reason why I gave a 4 is because its really hard to see from the road and parking is super tight! Other than that this place is a win!!!</Text>< user>

<Text>The food is good but the service is very slow. Probably because It was Sunday night. I recommend the Tum yum soup and the mango sticky rice.
Plenty of parking and easy access to the place.
They take debit and credit cards.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd4fT1v1UGLq13ZXNDPQyCPEP2h6-4S0Rv2Zck=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Very nice hole in the wall eatery. Great food, simple pricing, fair servings.

I would eat here again, ordered the Seafood with Thai Fried Rice, and it was delicious.

Parking definitely sucks as they're in between a barbershop and a smoke shop, and the lot is tiny. The location is easy to miss, and you'll need to park across the street or down the street from it.< /review><rate>4<//rate></record>

Food is really good, wait time was off. Ordered online through postmates and it said my order would be ready in 19 min. But it was more like 40 min. Not a huge deal, just wished I hadn't gotten there so soon.<//review>

Give them a high 9! Only because parking is a hassle and only has a few tables.... it’s getting popular in the end it’s worth it<//review>< pics>

<Text>There was a major issue with Grubhub. Basically Grubhub cancelled my order because the driver arrived at 4:30pm, right when Krua Thai opens. They say they called the restaurant, but I’m skeptical. Also why would you send a driver right at opening. You know food won’t be available! Moral of story is Grubhub sucks. Not the first time, but it is the last, they screw me over. I called the restaurant direct and a gentleman who might be named Tha helped me out and delivered the food to my family. I was out of town and wanted to make dinner easy for one night. Not only is the food always good, but they came through. Thank you.<//Text>< pics>

<user>108414588706793315665< /user><Review>Very friendly and kind waitress. We took our food home. Tastes great...except a little too spicy. I got Pad Thai with a spice level of 4 out of 10 and it's tolerable. My wife's green curry comes standard as a 3, and it's too hot for her... If you are kind of a wimp or novice when it comes to spice, I'd go with a 1 so you can taste and enjoy the wonderful flavor of the food. We also had the curry puffs and they were great! I chose to rate them a 3 instead of a 4 for the uncleanliness of the kitchen. It could be cleaned up a lot with a little effort. Other than that and the spice level, this place is great for a satisfying, and relatively inexpensive Thai dinner.

Edit: Since posting this review, the restaurant has put up a frosted glass divider on the counter - apparently to block your view of the kitchen. I can only assume this was done in lieu of a deep cleaning...<//Review><Rate>3</Rate><Name>Forrest S<//Name>< Time>

<text>I'm a big fan of pineapple fried rice and of big servings.. this restaurant is no joke, triple the servings compared to other Thai places I've been..
watch out for their spicyness if you order pineapple fried rice I reckoned you go MILD if your a wussy... I ordered the medium and it's spicy alright.. great restaurant for take out since it's small but that's just my opinion< /text>< time>

<review>Great menu options...from pho to pad Thai...you're bound to find something that'll satisfy your craving for tasty food.

I'm glad the server forgot to put in our appetizer order - fried veggie spring rolls because the entrée portions were huge.

We'd ordered:
Tofu and vegetable pad thai
Crazy udon with seafood

Both dishes were loaded with tons of fresh vegetables and well seasoned in their own sauces.</review><rate>3<//rate><UserId.>100479334274029682619<//UserId.><pics>None< /pics>< Time>

I've tried a few others but Krua is the go-to for me, really glad it's nearby where I work and well priced. Usually isn't crowded at all when I dine-in (very limited seating though). They do pick up orders so I typically do that.< /text><time>1427914724450< /time>< Response>

The pork fried rice is delicious. The drunken noodles have spice levels from one to ten. Don't go over 5 if you value you stomach. the gyoza are da bomb. Only problem is they close at 9 every day.</Text>

Huge, huge portions! I got the pad thai and drunken noodles to go but I was disappointed with the taste of both and I really wanted to like them too because like I mentioned the portions were enormous. The pad thai had an overwhelmimg taste of tamarind I had never experienced in pad thai before. Also, the parking lot is extremely small and when you back up you're literally driving into the sidewalk.</text>

The food is good and the prices are reasonable .  Hard to find a place to park.  Any spice level higher than mild is going to be HOT.<//Review>

< Review>
I was pretty disappointed, to say the least. I order Pad Thai, Crab Fried rice, and garlic wings to go. The crab fried rice was acceptable, but the wings were swimming in grease, and the pad thai was sub par.   I went there on a Sunday because the best Thai resturant (Tuktan) in Chula Vista was closed.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) I've only been eleven, but the "summer rolls" were very good and the green curry outstanding. Small, with good service.

I have only gone once, but the "summer rolls" were very good and the green curry excellent. The place is small, with good service.

He ido solamente una vez, pero los "summer rolls" eran muy buenos y el curry verde excelente. Es chico el lugar, con buen servicio.< /Text>

< Review>
The morning bun and banana cream tart are amazing. The bun is fluffy and flaky, which makes it a great texture as well as a nice baked food melting in your mouth. The banana cream tart isn't too sweet but has a nice texture to the banana cream. Super long line so go early if you want a seat and to beat the crowd. Another con is the prices for the baked goods but it is definitely worth the extra money.Bosco Bakery Cafe  the best bakery in CA.</Review>

This is very cozy place next to the beautiful Bosco Bakery Cafe with delicious brunches and special organic bakeries & cakes.

<review>Had breads here first time. Seems they made those  well. But there is one kinda pastry awful.
I think they have been putting it shelves for long time without knowing going to bad. There is Really strong, weird tastes inside bread. Hope they care about hygiene of products.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Really had very awful service experience with this bakery. As of start staff was very rude with bad attitude when I was asking questions. On top of that bc of purchasing larger size bakery asked for extra bag to carry staff said we are franchise store over sea and we ONLY have exactly amount bags so I can NOT give it out. Very nasty attitude with unprofessional franchise business with poor training staffs. Just found out that staff charged additional $5.50 top of my total cost which I didn’t buy ewwwwwe~~~. Call store numerous times but only ring once and get disconnected continually. What the heck !!  I would highly not recommend this franchise business for anyone period.< /review>

<Text>Bosco Bakery Café is a nice and cozy place to dine-in for a break, a breakfast or any time of the day as long as you pass by or really drop by Bosco Bakery Café will surely grab some of their cakes and pastries. I had Iced Sweet Potato Latte, Mochi cheesecake Bun and Blueberry Cake. One of my favorite is Fruit Shaved ice. Since its nutritious and yummy it’s also freshy served for you. I would recommend Bosco Bakery Café for any time of the day.<//Text>< Pics>

The product selection here can be a little bit hit or miss, but honestly for the price it’s hard to go wrong. Quality is decent and they do have lots of products it’s just sometimes hard to find apparel I love. It’s great for my little nieces and nephews though because I can get them some good stuff for the low!</Text>

The best retail store that I have found so far! They have the friendliest staff you can talk to about whatever you need from clothes to shoes etc. They offer great prices to their valued customers! Keep it up!<//review>

When I'm in the area, I love visiting this store.I find some great clothing deals/prices here for my toddler granddaughter. They also have clothing for the whole family as well as household goods. Take a chance and visit you'll-be surprised.< /Text>

Low price . Average to low quality clothing. TONS of kids stuff. Back to school..Tees.. Sweats Backpacks.. some home deco. (Almost Target grade.. not quite there) Single Soccer Mom's.. stretching every buck.. will  appreciate the low prices,variety and trending styles. You will find affordable jeans ..children's and adults. NOTE! AVOID WEEKEND HI TRAFFIC🤚 HOURS... 2 TO 6 PM. Good news is..Mucho free parking!</Text>

Lots of little goodies not expensive & sometimes some surprisingly good men/ women's clothes for half the price you pay in outlet stores. Especially good for younger boys & girls clothes priced right! Worth the looking.
Mostly cheerful service.< /Review>

<text>Crowded lines.. cheap clothes. Will fall apart after cleaning. Here you get socks..T shirts.. And maybe small children's pajamas? If you enjoy quality clothing.. It's not here but the locals are blue collar and they seemed pleased with the deals.. it's affordable so it's a good thing. Nordstrom's it's not. but they try. 👍And there are deals!!< /text>< date>

Falla's Paredes definitely has some deep discounts but of course it comes with a few drawbacks, mainly long lines, poorly organized racks, and a lack of sizes available. If you have the time and patience, however, to dig through the shelves and racks, you can score big without breaking the bank.

Tank tops, men's socks, and athletic shorts are the must sees whenever I shop here.< /text>

Interesting collection of goods, decent prices. It's always a bit of a challenge to find what you are looking for. And I've had some odd incidents while waiting in line. But it's usually worth it.</Review>

<text>Fallas is my favorite store in LA even though I rarely find anything good there. The clothes are bizarre... I'll find a shirt with a Polo tag that has a sharpie crossing out the name and then there'll be another tag stitched on under it that reads "Rocky Mountains Clothing" or something bizarre. It's a Polo shirt! I just found a bunch of WESC sweatpants but none of them were in my size. Really trip place. If you catch it at the right time it can be a gold mine. Only giving it the stars even though it's my favorite because it's pretty busted.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

FALLAS clothing store is on Broadway St at 5th St.  You never know what you might find from one week to another.  This store has 3 floors and is wonderful to pick up a reasonable gift for yourself or a friend (men, women or children).  I visit at least twice per month when i go for a walk downtown.< /Text>

Lots of selection & cheap prices. You can find some unique things here if you look. I'm ammending my review from 8 months ago. Great discount store but every time I check out the checkers have bad attitudes & hardly acknowledge you with a greeting or a thank you when completing the transaction. Although they regularly socialize with one another while ringing up their customers.  Good luck getting a better job or career. You don't even possess the most basic skill of all, customer service. They are indifferent & don't offer their undivided attention. Ring up purchase, collect payment & hand you your change. Whew! Think they broke a sweat?< /review>

<Review>It was a shame to realize that racism still exist. The Latino Only staff ignore the whole store to focus on me. As I walked through the door I heard the managers talking about me in Spanish. They are ignorant for thinking I don't understand them telling everyone to watch me because I have a purse. I slowly shopped taking my sweet time, and I observed a white woman and an Asian woman shop lift. The staff didn't notice nothing because they were playing hide and seek with me. As I was paying for my items I asked, "do you all believe that a black people are thieves?" And the cashier Dorothy replied "most of the people that steal from our store look like you, that why we have to watch them. The manager heard me talking at the register and never came to address the the issue even though she was the one giving the orders. I want to report them to HR.<//Review>< pics>

<review>This place has no mirrors and no dressing rooms, so forget about even trying something on over your clothes. Security was very rude to my 11 year old son. He assessed him directly about leaving his backpack at the from when I was standing right next to him. My son said they just threw his bag and didn't even give him a number.<//review>< Date>

It's always really messy but they do have some nice clothes! Just don't go into the kid's toy aisle, you'll probably trip over all the knocked over items.</review>

With great patience and perseverance you will find good stuff here...really, you just have to look for it. They have so many things and mostly good deals for women, men and kids, but don't expect the best quality, though!</text>

I love this store I come by every now and then and usually find awesome clothes I end up buying because of how good the deals are. Im not even joking you can buy clothing here for stupid cheap even I cant believe it. The store is overall kool you find what you need here but the thing that concerns me is they only have 1-2 cashiers. Causing the line to be long which is okay to me if Im not in a hurry but other than that this store is awesome.< /Text>

It's just a little bit too overcrowded with clothing racks that you have to squeeze thru. Overall very good selection of clothes with very good prices</review>

Just never get underwear from there because you will buy it and it will be like elderly women underwear but overall I like the store it has a lot of good pieces there but the people that work there are terrible and the people that go there are kind of weird to their really strange.</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I did not like it, I remember that before they had nice things, now there is nothing and that we are in the hot season, and only sweaters for cold, not even underwear avia all very old-fashioned, and there are no large sizes only small for small people both as adult and child, there are no large sizes. Do not go, you will just waste time.

(Original)
No me gustó, recuerdo que antes tenían cosas lindas, ahora no hay nada y eso que estamos en época de calor, y solo avia suéteres para frío, ni siquiera ropa interior avia todo muy pasado de moda, y no hay tallas grandes solo pequeñas para personas pequeñas tanto como adulto y niño, no hay tallas grandes. No vallan solo perderán el tiempo.< /Review>< Time>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It is a very inexpensive place, however care must be taken. Because you put promotions, but when it comes to paying, they tell you that they forgot to remove the sign, and that this offer has already expired ... I would understand if it was one or 2 offers ... but take 15 different items, and 10 of They told me that the promotion was no longer there. It does not seem fair to me. That I asked, and if not I would have done it ??? They charge me a normal price and I think it was a offer

(Original)
Es un lugar muy económico, sinembargo se debe tener cuidado. Porque pones promociones, pero a la hora de pagar, te dicen que se les olvido quitar el letrero, y que esa oferta ya expiro... entendería que fuera una o 2 ofertas... pero tome 15 artículos diferentes, y de 10 de ellos me dijeron que ya no estava la promoción. No se me hace justo. Eso que yo pregunte, y sino lo hubiera echo??? me cobran precio normal y yo pensando que era oferta< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>
