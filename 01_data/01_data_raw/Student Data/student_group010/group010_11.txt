Not like the TJ birria in flavor but still good. 27 bucks for two birrias and one consume. The tortillas could be better. Awesome customer service though and a couple outside tables.<//Text>

< Review>
Customer service is horrible. I was trying to order inside when the lady working the register redirected me to wait out side and said she would come take my order. I waited for a little while she never made it over to me. Instead she helped other customers. I was really disappointed in 5 months pregant and really hungry. Won't be coming back.<//Review>

Every one said this place was a go to so I finally went And tacos were amazing. However last two times were horrible I ordered quesabirria tacos that were the worst not fried right and no cheese at all I decided to recently try again and I went in 45 minutes before closing and they said they already served their last customer. Won’t be going back.<//text>

Finally got to try this spot after following them on Instagram for a while. They definitely lived up to the pics. Meat was juicy and the consome was amazing. They were very responsible dealing with Covid as well, offering both indoor and outdoor dining.< /Review>

Easy to notice from a moving vehicle. Large dining area with tables perfect for both small and large groups. They have one big screen tuned into the current soccer game. The minute you walk in, it smells like the delicious birria. They have a very simple menu with birria tacos ($2), tostadas, bowls of birria (full order is $10 and comes with tons of tortillas), canned/bottled sodas, and agua fresca. Food is served very quickly in plastic baskets, and is piping hot! That first bite reminded me of my abuelita's birria growing up. The only thing I wish this place had was air conditioning. The kitchen is so hot and steamy and opens up right into the dining area which makes it hot.< /Review>

Love these tacos! I suggest getting them the way they come then for your next time order then the way you would like. Get your favorite Verde sauce cause they don't have any.</text>

<text>Very delicious food, simple menu which could be seen as a pro and a con, I consider it a pro. Their name implies what they specialize in, hence the simple menu. With that being said, their birria is delicious, definitely going back, should plan to try and go during the week as I know the weekends get very busy! If you are looking for birria tacos with cheese, this is the place to go in San Diego!</text><userid>115072348093327638475<//userid><rating>4<//rating></record>

Walked in, sat down, ordered and before I could even check my facebook messages my food was ready. Really good price for the amount of birria you get. And their quesibirria was phenomenal</Review>< Pictures>

Food may be alright but HORRIBLE AND UNACCEPTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! AND DEFINITELY NOT COMPLIANT with health regulations since they DO NOT HAVE A RESTROOM to use or WASH your hands, especially during this pandemic.</review>

<Review>Discovered this place when they first opened up. Service has always been satisfactory, food has always been consistently good, prices are very reasonable. When we go, we're happy to be eating good birria somewhere on this side of the border rather than finding stuff to nitpick about. We've been here in the mornings, afternoons, and weekends and it has been consistently good. A smile and friendly attitude go a long way.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Stopped by for a quick bite and they lack filtered water to serve for there guest's... Only bottled water was available, that of which was offered for purchase. As far as I'm concerned restaurants need and should have filtered water to offer there guest's that do not drink soda. Either way great food and service just the water puzzle left me stumped. Hopefully that is fixed for the next time.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80d953a291b6b2b1:0x2ad8c79d2ce6b99b</Gmap_id><Rate>2</Rate><name>Eduardo Winter</name><user_id>108048436297818646059< /user_id>< response>

Birria is good but they always get the order wrong, music way too loud you have to yell the order, only one salsa for a medium order,  old vegetables (yellow limes and brown radishes) and not the friendliest cashier.<//Text>

Found this hidden gem. A
Fairly new place but let me tell you I was impressed by the prices and the food is so yummy! The quesabirria tacos are a must!! The service could be improved though. They need to be ready to approach a customer and offer a menu and drinks, especially if its not busy.<//review>

<review>Second visit, first one was good, this last time was not so much.
Salty birria that comes with  onions and cilantro, they decided, not you. Service was slow and no diet option. Actually, they didn't have a Menu, but people could order other dishes other than Birria?

I wanted Birria that day, dammmmmm.< /review><gmap_id>0x80d953a291b6b2b1:0x2ad8c79d2ce6b99b< /gmap_id>< Rating>

Started off with a young inexperienced waitress rushing to take our order without giving us the menu first. Ordered a menudo that was my mistake not good at all I had to ask the waitresses for the cebolla, cilantro and oregano after the menudo was served. On the positive side of this my mother enjoyed her birria Taco's.</review>

We went to have breakfast at what used to be Nuevo Mexico only to find they finally went out of business. We stuck around & ordered a bowl of menudo & some birriera tacos. After our order was corrected, everything was pretty tasty. The agua de jamaica was just right. The staff is all young. They just need to be seasoned<//Text>

So authentic you'll feel like you might actually be in TJ. Tried the birria tacos, birria tostada, and the orden grande birria bowl. If you aren't super hungry and just want to try birria I recommend the tacos, but if you want the full experience go for the bowl. You can get a half order too. My friend was a fan of the tostada, it has cheese melted and fried on it, but it was a little too crispy for me. I know, it's a tostada, that's the point - it's hard to explain, try one if you're curious and see if you like it. I think I'll try the quesadilla next time.<//text>

I'm not sure why this place gets such good reviews. The menudo stank like barnyard and the tacos were very greasy and pretty plain. It's ok, but just ok. You would be better off with some taco truck street tacos.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Good food, a little slow service. But the worst thing was that the cook was literally wearing the decorative mask. He didn't put it on all the time. I couldn't eat the food.

Comida buena, un poco lento el servicio. Pero lo peor fue que el cocinero literalmente traía el cubrebocas de adorno. No se lo puso en todo el tiempo. No me pude comer la comida.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) It lacked a bit of flavor to the birria. They serve very good quantity, the tortillas that serve for the birria are good. The hot sauce I loved very well that gave it to the birria.
They lacked putting the vegetables on the table so that one could get comfortable. Onion and cilantro. And a little more customer service. I missed the pictures of the food.

(Original)
Le faltaba un poco de sabor a la birria. Sirven muy buena cantidad, las tortillas que sirven para la birria están buenas. La salsa picante me encantó muy bien sabor que le dio a la birria.
Les faltó poner las verduras en la mesa para que uno se ponga al gusto. Cebolla y cilantro. Y un poco más de atención al cliente.  Se me pasó la fotos de la comida.</text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service when I went there were only 3 tables to attend and mine, but for the two waitresses it was a lot, they took more than 15 minutes just to take the order and if I asked for something like lemon or salt they took so long that the food was cooled
The food was more or less

(Original)
Servicio muy malo cuando fui unicamente habia 3 mesas para atender y la mia, pero para las dos meseras que habia fue mucho ps tardaron mas de 15 minutos solo para tomar la orden y si les pedia algo como limon o sal tardaban tanto que la comida se enfriaba
La comida estaba mas o menos< /Review>

I arrived discreetly at the counter and told them that if they please changed my frequency, they asked me why and I told them I got a piece of rag in my often. they gave, all the workers realized nobody approached my quotation I said thank you and I retired

I am not explaining, I am not apologetic, I am not aware of the lack of experience and staff training ...
in other establishments it has happened to me and the manager parsonalmete addresses the quotation, comments and apologizes and one leaves happy is aware one who does not do it on purpose

No uvo una explicación , no uvo una disculpa  no uvo nada se nota la falta de experiencia y capacitación del personal ...

<Text>(Translated by Google) I came to try this restaurant that offers Tijuana-style Birria in the Logan neighborhood of San Diego.

The birria dish costs around 10 dollars and the tacos 2 dollars each. This time I decide to order tacos and the truth is good.

The person who served me was very courteous and helpful.

I put 4 stars because it was just me and another table and the tacos took as if they had a lot of people. Beyond that I recommend this Birria Joint!

It's a small little park with this pretty artist detail just on the edge of downtown in a residential area.  Peaceful, beautiful with a small playground and lots of space to have a picnic, play or relax.<//Review>

Its good if you live in the neighborhood. Has a little playground, basketball court and bench area. Not a destination park if you have to travel to it.</Text>

Not much of a park, but it does have a Poke Stop and 2 Poke Gyms if you play Pokemon Go.< /Review>

Small little park located near the apartments. It's good to bring the kids in the daytime. The play ground area is pretty big.< /text>

Alot of homeless people hanging around getting high with the kids around playing. This park should have camera's or more police patrolling. Kid's can't even play out there. Might be child molesters . in this neighborhood there are alot.<//text>

Well located in a corner at the mall, this charming place has a great variety of pastries, sandwiches and etc. The coffee options are very good as well and the prices are very fair.

The self service idea make the whole experience fast and practical.<//text>

<Text>Hash brown pastry and strawberry coronet were very pleasing to consume, ingredients used were natural and few in number which I appreciate. The decor inside the bakery and the flavors of the pastries reminded my of my time in Paris a couple years back. Prices are high though due to the cost of producing fresh and delicious products< /Text><Name>Sir Ramsay<//Name><resp>None<//resp>< user>

The pastries are good. Place was dirty around the tables. Had to clean myself a table to seat down and drink my coffee. Need more people to help out. My purchase was over $20.00.<//review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>There are lots of workers behind the counter but only one was handling the register. And I suggest you don’t buy the salted caramel macaron. The filling doesn’t taste like salted caramel at all. It tasted like coffee, very strong and bitter. Maybe the cookie alone was salted caramel flavored but the filling was too overpowering.</review>< pictures>

If you like bread, cakes, and desserts, this is the place.  Tips: sometimes the line can he loooooong.  Look for the end of the Q as soon as you get there.</Review>

(Translated by Google) It's good but I expected to hear at least "hello, thank you, goodbye". Otherwise it's delicious 😋

I highly suggest avoiding this gym at ALL costs. Not like it matters because it doesn't seem like they are ever reopening. I moved last June due to military orders. This gym owes me money and you can't get in touch with anyone. I had to call my bank and have them put a stop payment on them because they continued to charge me even after I canceled. They owe my friend several hundred dollars as well. The lack of communication they've given current members, even staff is outrageous. Most unprofessional gym I've ever been to.< /review>

< Review>
This gym is really poor on communication they owe people so much money as well as they do to me. It’s been half a year. I can’t believe how a gym can take advantage of so many people without feeling guilty or giving people their money back. I saw a review on how the gym wasn’t giving people their money back just so they don’t go bankrupt is absolutely hysterical. This gym is the worst. People work for their money and may even struggle to get the amount of money they have taken. The fact that the gym was closed and people couldn’t workout and make the money worth is absolutely unprofessional.<//Review>

Definitely a good price. The equipment is older, but works perfectly. Sanitation (covid) is taken seriously. There's tons of cleaning stations, and the staff are always going around cleaning/refilling stations. I've seen everyone do their part in this is well. I'm more than comfortable coming here.</text>

My gym. An outside gym- just like Venice Beach! Outdoor pool and basketball courts. Sauna and showers. Two levels tho spread out and workout. Spacious. Right next to freeway onramp makes it convenient to get to work fast too! Staff is always friendly and helpful.< /Text>

I personally love this place, I've been coming here for about 6months now and sure they are much older than most gyms but they recently got new weights and equipment with more changes to come! The place is pretty clean as well and the staff and members are always friendly. What I believe separates this gym from others is, that dog house vibe it has too it if you know what i mean? Other places have strict policies and limitations (too sophisticated); here you can grunt, mentor one another, and motivate yourselves, other newer gyms prohibit such behaviors for they "discourage" others which defeats the whole gym club idea and feels more like a babysitting club lol. Anyways give this gym a try if your a first timer or seasoned athlete.💪< /text>

<text>My favorite gym in my area! They have everything you need to get in shape! The staff/trainers are great and it’s just a fun place to just workout in peace with out having to wait to use a certain equipment because they have multiple ones! I highly recommend going to the WORLDS GYM in Oxnard not to mention they have a juice bar for your post workout gains!!!</text>< pictures>

It has gotten better. For the longest time the pads would rip up and they would take forever to replace it. So the spongey padding would be exposed and get saturated in people's sweat and hair product. The worst smells ever. Randomly too, not just the old busted pads. Like certain areas on the rubber mats or some weights even. And instead of addressing those health affecting items, they would rather take months for a simple remodel, removing all the wall mirrors and replacing them with smaller mirrors. Making the gym look much smaller than before now.
I would like to get in the pool but not there, ever. I remember it was closed for the longest time too. Men's bathroom actually rarely smells bad and is decently clean 99 percent of the time. I know that takes effort and that is a big pet peeve for most.<//text>

BE CAREFUL. This company has issues with keeping their word. I was signed up for a year long contract even though the agreement I signed did not state it was a 12 month agreement. Tried to cancel and even received a confirmation email from the general manager stating my membership was cancelled. A month later I’m still being charged...< /review>

<text>Think twice about joining this Gym!   The locker room is old and not that clean, it's in serious need of improvement. The worst is when you go to take a hot shower and no such luck. Many times you're taking a cold shower and it takes them days to fix the problem? Many of the machines are very old and missing pins. The work out equipment outside is also very old and in disrepair.  Wish I had something positive to say about this gym.< /text>< pictures>

Gym has gotten a little better since renovations as torn up mats were replaced and a few more machines but stretching area was completely removed and replaced with a single mat for everyone who doesn't have access to the group training area.

Still good for the price but you may have to wait for a machine a while if you come during peak hours, and parking can also be a bother during those times .plus everyone says cancelling is a pain in the butt so keep that in mind.<//text>< pictures>

First things first the gym ain't perfect but what gym ever is..I'll admit it's a little rough around the edges but you cant beat the atmosphere this gym provides unless you're one of those picky people who think every huge guy in a tank is a douche. The staff are always nice and if your a local then it's a chill environment it's also a great place to meet new people or even meet up with friends. This is a gym for  grinders and people who wish to workout without any rules or limits if you want a gym that's pretty, nice, and sounds like a library then you better stay at planet fitness.<//Text>

<review>I joined the gym and continue to stay primarily because of the classes they offer. I do use the weight machines and sauna. This is where I have a problem. When the equipment breaks, it stays broken for extended time. Half of the cable machines are missing parts or not operating all together.  The men's sauna has been broken going on two weeks. The management is pretty much non responsive to complaints. They focus on window dressing and campaigns to add more members but not on maintaining their equipment in working order..</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1553788912524, 'text': "Sergio, we do our best to handle complaints in a timely manner and in the order in which they come to our attention.

Signed up online in order to swim but later found out their pool wasn’t heated during the winter. Tried to cancel my membership for the next month and they told me I was locked into a 12-month contract. Nowhere during the online enrollment did it mention I was signing up for a year long contract. In fact, the very first section of the terms and conditions is “Month to Month Agreement.” Spoke with the general manager and she said she needs to email someone about this but it has been over a week and no word yet. I’ve read through the agreement and gone through the online enrollment process over a hundred times already.... wonder what’s taking so long...

UPDATE: Upon writing this review, the manager reached out and stated to me they  canceled my membership as I requested. A month later I am still being charged...< /text>

<Text>Don't join, unless you like having to bring your own weights & equipment for the cable machines. Have to hunt for everything unless they lock it up in one of the rooms so you can't use it. Good luck in getting out of their in an emergency, the exits are blocked by equipment, an employees or members park in front of the exits all the time what I have seen. Theirs no gym etiquette in their by the employees or members. It all has to start with the employees an management but when you talk with the manager he looks at you like you don't know what your talking about. I can keep going on but there is to much, after my time expires Iam going to look for another gym if they don't improve, this one is the worst gym I've been in.< /Text>< rating>

Gym needs Alot of work.. Equipment has been broken for months.. Which include, showers.. Hot water has been off over a week.. Hot box as well.. It seems like managed is only concerned with making sure your monthly dues are on time, then fixing the problems in the gym.. The enhancement fees from my understanding are to keep the gym running smoothly.. But that is not the case.. I will admit the original owner of Golds, wasn't exactly the nicest person to be around, but he definitely made sure his Gym was up and running.. If something was broken or run down, it was taken care of b4 the week was out.. Not so much with the management you have at the moment.. losing the theater and power cage was definitely a disappointed.. I understand Zumba and Spin are the thing for the moment.. But lets not forget about the other members who enjoy other things.. The very big cage is a waste of space.. So much equipment could take its place.. The front desk and maintenance workers are very friendly ( at least to me ) in a professional way.. But some clients do have a problem with woman going in men's locker room while they are trying to change.. Not the maintenance fault.. It is management.. Schedule a male as well as a woman at the same time.. The new Golds is coming sooner than later and I do know, if World's does not get going with the complaints, u are going to lose Alot of buisness.. Hope fully that should concern you, instead of thinking, not a problem.. I have been a member when we were in back of Costco.. I enjoy the gym.. but until changes are made, I would not recommend people to sign.. Because the vibes I get is, if you don't like the way things are, u can leave..A real issue I'm having is with Worlds trying to send my bill to collections.. I was out of the gym, almost a yr, because of health issues.. I received a call from collections telling me I was behind on payment.. Which I knew nothing about.. According to the front desk.. and management, they knew nothing about it as well.. So once again, lots of problems to fix with the gym.. I keep hearing changes are coming, and that is all we have been hearing.. Hear say...( 9/ 27 / 19...I like Alot of customers or client, do not want to hear about understanding the frustrating of how we feel.. We would much rather see results.. ( Meaning changes for the better )... Worlds should not need to hear about complaints on equipment... In closing, it should not take a new Golds gym to open as well, to get things going.. Which I see is starting to happen..)</review>

You're temporarily closed.
Why are you charging me the recurring payment?
Why are you charging me the club fees?
These fees need to be pushed back until you reopen
$35 charge in the month of April.
This seriously can't be your business model.?</review>

(UPDATE)
Despite my earlier negative review, I have been going here for a few years and I have decided to change my review to 5 stars. They have made efforts to improve and continue to do so, and also, this pandemic has brought out everyone's true colors and I am extremely proud to say that the gym I go to takes the pandemic seriously, unlike certain other gyms in the area that refuse to close and refuse to require the wearing of masks due to never having actually read the US Constitution.

<rate>2</rate><Text>I've been a member her for well over 10 years and I'm not one to normally complain publicly, but I'm pretty frustrated with this place as of late.

Over the last few years the quality of this has diminished. Machines hardly get fixed and always seem to break, the cardio equipment is always down or malfunctioning and half the dumbbells are either broken or completely missing. There was even a time frame where the bathroom door stall was missing a lock for over a week. Benches have been left broken for weeks and there are many simple things that go uncared for.

Many of the bars for Olympic lifts are completely bent to the point where they really should be changed out, floor mats are damaged etc..

Currently they remodeling and the place is a mess, lots of things have been moved or unavailable, one in particular being the cage for Olympic lifts which was probably the best thing about this place. This gym has been long overdue for a remodel for many years, I am just hoping that it actually gets better and not worse.

Some of the staff here is friendly and polite while others are not. The gym does offer some machines i really do like as they are more old school and I feel work better. My feelings have been quiet mixed about this place as it has been the only gym I've felt like I can always get a good workout, but as of late its all just been frustration. Not sure if this will remain my gym.

Heads up new members always get nice deals for year to year contracts while long term members don't share the same benefit, which has always seemed odd to me.

Anyways, I tried make this as unbias as possible. So maybe take what I say with a grain of salt, but I wouldn't be the first one to complain about these issue.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80e84c0eee719d17:0xabc1261ec3a822b3</Gmap_id></record>

Horrible customer service, most equipment is broken or outdated, very dirty floors and some flooring even torn up (which is a BIG hazard in a gym), mens bathroom is unclean 80% of the times I've visited. It's also greatly over populated, which is in itself alone not worth the membership there. Honestly the worst gym I've ever had a membership at, but if you're looking for a workout for cheap this is the place for you. But be warned, you get what you pay for here.

Take a tour of the gym before you sign up if you think any part of my review is untruthful.</Review>

<Review>I would NOT recommend this gym. They make it impossible to cancel a membership. I went in to try to cancel because I was moving out of state but instead told me I needed to mail a letter with my reason for canceling to that same address I was already at. After I mailed the letter I found out they still continued to charge me. When I called to see what was going on the staff told me someone will call me back and never did. Very unprofessional rude staff that are just trying to take money from people. Also before they told me there would be no cancellation fee because I was a long time member but now they want to charge me for canceling.</Review><Time>1533911485467< /Time>< Rating>

<review>First, This gym was redesigned to accommodate the group training sessions ( I'm assuming thier money maker) and repositioned all the equipment wherever they could fit it leaving little space for working out. The equipment is outdated, which I don't mind, but there's pins missing on half the machines, cable equipment missing or stolen and dumbbells are scattered with no organization (very hard finding a matching pair). As mentioned on another post people parking at the fire exits which would make it hard to evacuate if there ever was an emergency.

Second, I was a memeber for 3 years and when I asked to cancel my membership the first thing I was asked was "Why" which doesn't even matter in my opinion and shouldn't even be asked. The next thing was the "HIDDEN CANCELATION FEE" of $25, which her response to that was "it's a business" and just smirked. The last thing was I needed to fill out a request and sign just to cancel my membership, she couldn't cancel there on the spot. I didn't know I needed your bosses approval to cancel MY membership, I would find another gym if you could.</review><gmap_id>0x80e84c0eee719d17:0xabc1261ec3a822b3</gmap_id><Date>1555729426175</Date><user>115157454825378673417< /user></record></dataset><record>

This gym has its pros and cons I definitely would not recommend this gym its not well organized all the weight machines are scattered all around the gym, the machines are really rusty the restrooms are really dirty worse then any place I have ever seen overall this gym really needs an update in just about everything .. the good thing about this gym is that is has a women's section which I love but again the machines are rusty I absolutely love the boxing room and how the women's have their own sauna in the restroom it's really nice but I don't think it's worth the price<//Text>

<review>Biggest ripoff ever! I told all my friends not to join and told them about my experience. I signed a contract for a year and they deducted $10 every month I paid $35 application fee.  And then at the end of the year they kept charging so I went to cancel and they charged me $25 fee they say for processing. This is such a rip-off I already paid for one year and then they charge again at the end of the year, after the contract should be over?

I started going to this gym a few years ago when it was first Gold's Gym. I kept going even after they switched to different owners, etc. up until now that it's been World Gym. I spoke to the manager a few months ago because I wanted to lower my monthly payments and was promised a much lower rate. They began charging me that rate for about 4 months and the last 3 months they have been charging me the same previous amount. I've gone in to talk to them, emailed, called and nothing gets this issue resolved. I want to cancel my membership but I've heard horror stories regarding cancelation. I'm definitely unhappy with the unprofessional service and lack of follow up with me as well as follow through.< /review>

< review>
When joining initially the staff was friendly, but very disorganized. There were mistakes on my paperwork & I was never emailed a copy of my contract. I asked multiple times, but was finally printed a copy. When you first enroll you are given an appointment with a personal trainer. They told me that the trainer would show you how to use all the equipment at the gym. False. They have you work out in the “cage” & do an assessment of your physical abilities. The trainer will speak with you about fitness goals & review pricing for personal session trainings & complete a body analysis. This is not done in private & anyone in the office/around the cage is aware of your height, weight, & body classifications. I signed up for the VIP membership (49.99 per month) & personal training sessions 2x per week (400 per month). After signing up for sessions I went to my first workout, two treadmills and one stationary bike were broken. I notified the front desk & was treated very rudely. Initially I enjoyed the personal training, but found that the training regime was not for me. This gym is focused on bodybuilding/CrossFit style training. If you are seeking training that involves Pilates, yoga, etc. this is NOT the place for you. The gym does not offer space for mat exercises, except for the cage (and you have to be signed up for the VIP package to use it), but be prepared to tuck yourself into a little corner. I suggest bringing your own mat. The gym has two mats (two??) & they never get cleaned. The training staff is very toxic & gossip about each other &clients. I have heard trainers point out clients & make comments about their lack of progress, how they are still overweight, etc. In the main area pins are broken, seats ripped, etc. People also will use equipment as a place to sit and rest (and text), so be prepared to wait for a machine. On my last visit (which is catalyst for me to stop attending this gym) I heard a trainer say that I was a “stay-at-home type” who was making little progress. When I came in to notify my intent to cancel, I did so per the contract’s instructions, 30 days prior to the end. If you cancel be prepared for backlash! When you give your intent to cancel you’re met with rude staff that is unwilling to walk you through the process. You will have to meet with Denise to cancel personal training sessions (if you enrolled), filling out a form that states why your are cancelling. You will not get a copy of this form. I wasn’t given any paperwork notifying my intent to cancel, but was told they would “call me.” I still have time on my contract, so I went to Joe Bustamante to request info on cancellation. He was very rude and escalated the situation by responding aggressively and was very dismissive. He then said I needed to speak with someone named Jenelle and that she wasn’t there. In short, you cannot cancel until 30 days prior to your final month. If you do not cancel they will charge you each month until you cancel. After reviewing my contract, I realized that my credit card on file was about  to expire. Knowing that I needed to finish paying for the remainder of my contract I brought this up and was told I needed to speak with Denise, again, who was not available, and was told I would need to wait or come back. When I stated that I would wait Joe tried to get me to leave the gym, and stated that he would email me. I declined and said I would wait. An hour later when Denise was available I explained that I needed to update my card information. She shared that Joe & another front desk attendant named Randall could do that. (Seriously?!) I requested an email copy of my contract and Joe refused. He stated my physical copy was the same and that I didn’t need it. I pressed and was finally given a copy. Randall updated my payment info, when I said thank you for assisting he was rude in return and asked me to leave. (Even though I am still paying member.) The gym needs to understand that members have a right to cancel and they need to handle these situations with professionalism and tact.</review>

I would give 0 stars if I could! I canceled my membership because I moved to college and this is the 2nd month I've been charged since I canceled my membership. They make it such a hassle and they need a better system. Horrible service.<//Text>

Cardio theater sold me, but it's so outdated. The screen looks very dim and sound is horrible. Half of the machines don't work. This gym has so much potential,  but lacks maintenance.< /review>

Sure the gym needs a better AC/air purifier, new pads on majority of the benches, new floor grip Ruber, and give better lubrication to the machines​. (That work requires time and money that has to come from the gym profit not the owner).
Also is people would care about not dropping weight to the floor that almost want to dig wholes with them,  re-rack weights​ back to its place instead of leaving them who know where. I wouldn't be surprised if there were in the restrooms. People (member have to apport a bit to have the gym great.
They go all sweaty from bench to bench they don't dry or clean with paper. "Carry a gooddam ✋ towel with you" that'll help to have longer life or the benches, re-rack weight back don't be too lazy, if you drop the weights that's means you're not strong enough go lighter on weight till to become stronger.
And get your lazy butt to workout instead of using your cellphone to watch videos or whatever. Let someone else use the them if your too busy with your phone. Stay home save your gym money so you don't have to complain. Care for the gym as it was yours, that way you'll always do a workout at a gym your proud to be member of.

Great gym: I left 24hrs for this one.
The owner is doing great job at having a better gym every day.

To the owner: It would be pretty cool of you to not forget about beach gym, some are red painted and look great but it would be even greater if all of them were repaint red to avoid rusting machines and throw some mirrors.as.a bonus.  Thanks.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I gave it 2 stars because the gym' s appearance at first glance looks pretty good but as my wife and I began to do our workout, we noticed a lot of the equipment are old, the rubber flooring mat is torn in the dumbell area, some of the benches are also torn, and there was a seated bench that had caution tape around it because the metal legs was cracked (this should not be on the floor for use). Weights are just laying everywhere and members don't put them back and there are no signs posted to remind members to re-rack weights (or at least we didn't see any signs). We also didn't notice cleaning wipes or towels for members to wipe down machines and benches when done. We were just visiting on a VIP pass to see if we would like the gym but I didnt like that they keep your I.D. card while you workout so when you finish you have to talk with the sales rep again. When we went to leave, Josh, who we talked to before the workout, had gotten off but the other guy did not know where our I.D.'s were in which the front desk lady had to come show him where they were. Then i tried to buy protein shake but no one was at the counter to take my order. One lady did get a drink out the cooler but did not say anything to me to indicate that someone will assist me or not. I'm not paying that much money and the equipment is outdated, flooring and benches are torn and no one at the counter to buy a protein shake. Josh was very nice to us and showed us around but we came when he was about to get off.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80e84c0eee719d17:0xabc1261ec3a822b3< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This gym and its owners have had a terrible streak of financial issues. I am not surprised ownership has been transferred many times. I closed my membership with World Gym in early 2016; however, they decided to continue withdrawing membership dues from my bank in November. I have requested refunds of the unauthorized charges they still continue to withdraw from my account and they have yet to do anything about it. I would not trust this business with your financial information, if they guarantee that there will be no issues, think again and run out the door.< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>(Translated by Google) The attention in previous years was regular, but now it is very bad, the new personnel do not have clear information. The person who answers the phone hangs up on you. If you have doubts you have to go personally and when you are there as they do not have enough knowledge they redirect you to an email. The website is not up-to-date, you don't know if all the facilities are working or just outside. I definitely do not recommend it. Besides that you have been paying in quarantine they should provide a better service. 👎

La atención en años anteriores era regular, pero ahora es malísima, el personal nuevo no tiene la información clara. La persona que contesta el teléfono te cuelga. Si tienes dudas tienes que ir personalmente y cuando estás allí cómo no tienen suficiente conocimiento te redireccionan a un correo electrónico. La página de internet no está actualizada no sabes si ya está funcionando todas las instalaciones o solo afuera. Definitivamente no lo recomiendo. Aparte que has estado pagando en la cuarentena deberían brindar un mejor servicio. 👎<//Text>< pictures>

This office is amazing! It’s always great choosing a family dental practice. All of the staff are great. I typically see Dr. Maddie or Dr. Mark and they’re always so attentive and gentle.

It’s challenging choosing an office when you move to a new area and finding trust in dentists. They always go above and beyond and definitely don’t try to tell you more then what’s necessary. I trust them and recommend this office when it comes to dental hygiene 🤩</text>

< review>
I haven’t been to the dentist in WELL over a year and was actually having some concerns regarding my gums. Surf smile got me in the next day and the appointment couldn’t have been more perfect. I saw Dr. Mark this time and he was just incredible. We did the exam and X-rays. Then he reviewed all of his findings with me. Fortunately there was nothing alarming going on but he went above and beyond to reassure me and educate me on what dentists look for in X-rays that could be problematic. We got to talking as he is actually a Navy veteran and we had that in common! I also discussed my family and had mentioned my son was special needs and not a fan of the dentist. Dr. Mark is actually well acquainted with my kids pediatric dentist but generously offered to see my son ((or daughter)) if there was ever an emergency and we couldn’t reach their dentist - Wow! Even with all the chatting we got though the cleaning quickly. I wasn’t even there for an hour! Fast, professional, and personable. Highly recommend.< /review>

< review>
We only came across this place because of a suspected dental emergency (On a Friday night of course 😬)  Turns out what we thought was a bad cavity was actually an adult molar trying to come in while a baby molar wouldn't budge. We thought all those baby teeth were gone. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Dr. Warner quickly figured it out and was able to take care of it right there. And they open at 7am on a Saturday? Amazing. They are so kind there, professional and a *very* clean office. Kids, well people in general dont particularly like visiting the dentist, but Dr. Warner made my son feel SO comfortable and relaxed. We will 100% see them regularly until we move! Highly recommend!!<//review>

<review>My husband and I have both had excellent experiences with cleanings at Surf Smiles Dentistry, especially with Dr. Madeline Warner who is always super friendly and helpful. SSD is conveniently located in a quaint business park and the office itself is spacious, clean, and welcoming.

Both Dr. Warner made me feel at ease. Hadn’t been to the dentist in a while. Both made me feel at ease. They explain what they were doing and their opinion at the end. Was very helpful. Would recommend any buddy especially family and friends to go to Surfside smile dental. For there dental needs. Too bad you cannot give out 10 stars< /Review>

My son and I have both seen Dr. Madeline Warner for almost a year. The first time I took my then 3-year-old son, she was extremely patient with him and explained everything before doing it.

A few weeks ago, my son had a bad fall while riding his scooter, and he chipped his tooth. I called Dr. Warner, and she knew exactly who we were when I said my name and told me to bring him in that day. Once again, she was calm and patient with my boy who was in a lot of pain and scared. She even checked in on him the next day to see how he was doing. Since then, he likes playing dentist and looking at my teeth. He's not scared at all.

I appreciate the family feel of the practice, and how caring they are. I feel very fortunate to have found Surf Smiles and Dr. Warner.<//Review>

Surf Smiles made me feel so comfortable. Dr. Warner guided and explained everything he was doing/seeing. I haven’t been to the dentist in a while due to not having good experience but Surf Smiles has 100% turned that around. I look forward to getting fixed up and I highly recommend Surf Smiles!</text>

I was not a patient at surf Smiles Family Dentistry and had noticed a filling had fallen out, 4 days before we are supposed to move across the country. When I called they were so nice and able to get me right in! Dr.Warner was AMAZING she spent so much time with me, explaining things, etc. I normally have so much anxiety regarding dental work and I had the best anxiety free visit! I honestly wish we were staying in California so my whole family could come here!!!!!</review>

<Review>I had avoided going to the dentist for a very long time, but maybe that’s why God invented throbbing tooth pain! In any case, I finally had to find a dentist, and Dr. Warner made me feel very comfortable. For as long as I had neglected my teeth, I wasn’t in too bad of shape aside from the one painful tooth that ultimately needed a root canal. It’s a small office, they are very friendly and made me feel comfortable, and I am SO glad to be back on track with my dental visits!</Review></record>

<text>I am so happy I found this Dentist. I only wish I would have found it sooner. I had horrible anxiety about going and needed to get caught up on dental work. They made me feel so comfortable.  Dr. Mark worked later in the evening which helped me be able to get my work done with being a mom. His wife who is also a dentist there answered the phone in a way that was just so inviting. It's family owned and just a very nice place to go . Honestly care about getting your mouth healthy again.</text><Response>{'time': 1581467307239, 'text': 'Thank you Mackenzi!'}</Response></record>

I chipped my front tooth the weekend before thanksgiving. We called Dr. Madeline Warner and they came in on a Sunday afternoon for an emergency visit. I’m very greatfull to have found such a wonderful practice! Both Dr. Madeline and Mark Warner are very professional and dedicated to their patients. I highly recommend them to anyone reading this! They have my loyalty as a customer.<//review>

<Time>1563735594159</Time><rating>5<//rating><Text>It has been years since I have been to the dentist. As a child living on Long Island, my dentist had been Dr. Hoeg, the father of Dr. Madeline Warner. Therefore, it was fitting to seek out Dr. Warner while on a trip to California. The office is brand new, clean, and bright. When asked about the beautiful canvas photographs, Dr. Warner explained that they love to travel and they took the photos themselves.
After letting Dr. Warner know about how long it had been since I had seen a dentist, she told me she would work diligently on my teeth so that the staining would be gone. Dr. Warner was extremely kind and explained what she was doing. My teeth were in pretty bad shape but she didn’t mind and took time to eliminate the stain and buildup. Unfortunately, she also found my first cavity. Dr. Warner wrote down information from my visit and promised to pass it on, along with the x-rays, to my new dentist in NY. Dr. Warner gladly helped recommend a few dentists in my area and I go tomorrow!
I truly wish Surf and Smiles was in New York. It is going to be very hard to find a dentist that is as smart and kind as Dr. Madeline Warner. If you are looking for a new dentist, do not hesitate. Call up Surf and Smiles and set up an appointment!</Text>< Pics>

She was extremely thorough and explained everything along the way. She did her best to make sure my experience was painless and that all my concerns were addressed. After both appointments I even received follow up emails to ensure everything was feeling okay and thanking me for my visit.

<review>From the moment I walked in, Dr. Warner was extremely welcoming and the atmosphere of the office made me feel more than comfortable. Both Dr. Warner’s made it a priority to make sure I understood what was going on with my mouth and the dental treatment I was going to need and they included me in the conversation the whole time. Their thorough explanations and extreme professionalism settled any worries I had about going to the dentist. Not only was the experience more than amazing, but also reassuring to know they actually care about their patients and not just the price tag!
I would defiantly recommend this dental practice to anyone that is looking for a family dentist! They are also accommodating to military families and pediatrics!< /review><Name>Demi Trebatoski<//Name>< pics>

What a wonderful dentist!  This is a brand new, clean, beautiful office with all the newest tools.  They are very knowledgeable about the military and they handled my insurance with no issues.  I had a cavity filled today after having my teeth cleaned a few weeks before and I can tell you that she did very fast, expert work both times.  Lastly,​ she even remembered everything we had spoken about the first time, which shows me she listens, cares and wants to build a long term relationship with me and my family. Definitely check out this new office and see for yourself!< /Text>

<Text>I had to have a root canal done by Dr. Madeline Warner. The work that Dr. Warner did has completely changed my smile. The visit was painless and the atmosphere they have created is pristine.

<review>Today was my first visit to Dr. Madeline Warner. I'm a Registered Nurse and military spouse with Tricare insurance. Fortunately I found and chose this Dentist office listed within the Tricare network. This location is very convenient and close to home within only 5 min. The office appears new and is very nice and clean. She is the first Dentist to take the time to thoroughly explain my dental health and recommended follow-up/treatment plan. I already made my second appointment scheduled next week to fix past dental work. I appreciate the knowledge and support of military families. I'm impressed after my first experience here and highly recommend! I recently moved here and glad I found my Dentist here in Oceanside, Cali. Excellent service!

<review>Over the weekend I experienced what everyone's worst nightmare is.. a broken tooth. I was unaware of a cavity that had caused a lot of decay that resulted in a break. I knew that finding a dentist to treat me would be a difficult task because I am a cash patient (insurance doesn't kick in until March 1st). I was hesitant to even go because I knew I wouldn't be able to afford a crown etc with cash upfront, but convinced myself to go to one at least to see what it would take to fix my tooth.

I called Surf Smiles on 2/10/20 at about noon.. and they were able to fit me in same day! I mention that I was a cash patient and they quoted me a reasonable 89$ for a visit and x-rays. As I showed up to my appointment, I quickly noticed the well put together office. It's a beautiful spot. I was greeted by Dr. Hoeg at the front desk promptly and was asked to wait to be called. Not more than 10 minuted later, I was called to the back by Dr. Mark Warner who stated I would be seeing Dr. Hoeg for my appointment, but he was in a meeting so he would be starting my visit. (I thought that was very courteous because most of the time you're kept waiting when something like that occurs)

Dr. Mark Warner was very friendly and was quick to get my x-rays going. Dr. Hoeg came in shortly after and I was amazed by how nice he is!! Seriously just a genuinely nice individual. While I was getting my tooth looked at, Dr. Madeline Warner came in to introduce herself (seriously how nice is that?). I quickly realized that this practice is family run and they care about their patients as individuals. You're not just a number or price tag to this family! Dr. Hoeg continued to examine me and was very conservative in my treatment as he was trying to avoid a root canal (which I very much appreciate!!) I expressed to him that I am a cash pay patient and would be interested in a temporary solution to my tooth problem if need be until my insurance kicked in. I was blown away with his work ethic and compassion as he completely restored my tooth and was able to work with me on pricing. You literally can't even tell I had half of my tooth missing. (pictures listed as reference)

Not only am I (and my whole family) a patient for life, but I am actually excited to return and work on my other dental issues. I will continue to rave about this practice as long as they are in business! Thank you Surf Smiles, you have restored my smile (and faith in humanity).< /review></record></dataset><record>

I happened to be staying at the Residence Inn in Oceanside and ready to head to San Diego to spend time with my 101 yr old dad who is navigating his last days...as friends and family come into town.
So i was flossing my front teeth when one of the front veneers go flying and fortunately doesn't land in the hotel toilet.   Now I had one more thing on my plate to take care of.
I decided to look for a local dentist and by the luck of the draw I found Surf Smiles Family Dentistry.   Madeline answered the phone and said her dad could meet me at the office at 9:45am.  She was so caring and accommodating....so i figured what do I have to lose.  She texted me forms to complete, and I texted her my dental insurance.  So as I showed up at the office....all was done ....what service.   Dr Mark got my veneer cleaned, and glued back on and also provided some helpful dental advise because he is a true professional
Dr Mark..was so gracious and welcoming, and Madeline who initially took my call is Dr Madeline.
If you are tired of the dental offices that treat their business like a production factory...please jump ship and go to Surf Smiles Family Dentistry.....   If they treat an out of town person with care and concern...whats it like if you live there and become part of their Family practice.<//text>

<Text>From making the phone call to set up an appointment for a new patient exam, to filling out the online patient forms and receiving a phone call the day before my filling appointment, to walking in and being greeted so professionally and in a timely manner, I was completely blown away with how incredible Dr. Mark and Dr. Madeline Warner were.  The atmosphere of the office reflects and radiates  with how much time, effort, and passion they put into making sure their patients get the most honest opinions on what dental care they truly need. They make you feel like family from the start and are excellent at thoroughly explaining your treatment to you.  I would highly recommend this practice to anyone looking for a dentist who truly has your best interest at heart. Hands down the best dental care I have ever received and I am happy to say that  I have found my forever dentists and will continue coming back for any dental treatment needed and my annual cleanings. Also if you want a general idea of what’s going on in the office, check out their Instagram and it will for sure put a huge smile on your face! @surfsmilesoceanside<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

We were helped by Laura and Emily who were absolutely amazing in getting us taken care of. With the stress of a move coming from overseas and bumming out on buying houses, we made a last minute decision to go with military housing and these ladies were spot on with assistance. Would recommend to anyone coming from overseas!<//text>

He was unbelievably impolite and unprofessional. There was no sign of professionalism or compassion in his tone of voice. As we all know, moving is a rough process emotionally and physically, but relocating while serving in the military makes it much harder. I am disappointed.< /Review><username>Jennifer Johnson<//username>< Pictures>

We just experienced possibly the very best service of all time. Courtney was efficient and been very patient throughout the process of the housing application that me and my husband were trying to avail. She was kind enough to provide us the necessary information and was able to respond forthwith. We were so impressed with how well-organized the Lincoln Military Housing office and of course we're grateful to have experienced the exceptional service from one of your staffs. Such a remarkable employee and housing office!
We are so excited to move to our new HOME in the next few weeks.<//Review>

Applied for a spot in early to mid Jan and was told would be on the waiting list for about 3-6 months; not excited. Boom! Fast forward to mid Feb just one month later with a call from Laura Gwynne and an offer for a place; super excited. Laura was amazing in helping us get things in order. Best experience for housing so far.<//Review>

I have been harassed for the last 3 months by the leasing office about a pet I DO NOT OWN ! I was told the district manager looked through my windows and saw 2 dogs tho I only have one emotional support animal. Now I am receiving calls every few weeks DEMANDING paperwork , the homes are run down , appliances are old , one room reeked of pet urine upon moving in , parking is a joke....not enough spots for even half the people who live here , please don’t move here !

From late-June 2020 until mid-July 2020, I executed PCS from Camp Lejeune, NC to San Diego, CA. Due the COVID-19 situation, we originally planned to reserve a home in the Miramar Milcon area; sight un-seen though. Upon arrival to MCAS Miramar, I requested to see the residence before signing our lease, which was permitted.

For whatever reason the home was not prepped appropriately for a new family. I will spare the details; bottom line: UNACCEPTABLE!

This is why my review is actually very positive. When one door closes, another opens! Despite the horrible experience at Miramar Milcon, Lincoln Military Housing representative, Courtney, was able to provide an alternative solution/location for our family. Through many phone conversations and emails, she coordinated with adjacent Lincoln Military Housing reps locking on a freshly renovated 4-bedroom home in close proximity to my workplace; all in two days!

For her efforts and constant support, my trust and faith was restored in the military housing process. I do encourage families to consider military housing as an option for their living situation in San Diego, especially if Courtney is their housing agent.</text>

I am not very pleased with Lincoln. I'm not sure how they have 4.1 stars, to be honest. The experience has been a horrible experience. They are NOT at all pet friendly (for dogs). They expect you to have small dogs under 25 lbs... with all of their communities, having 2-3 pet friendly homes, is absolutely ridiculous. Your choices are to either get rid of your pet or go elsewhere, in a "military" community. What a joke!</review>

With moving from VA to here we had a lot of trouble trying to contact the correct people and representatives within Lincoln housing. For months we got the run around with constant conflicting answers that seemed to stem more from complacency from the staff then anything. I was finally put in contact with Keith and he simplified everything on what we needed to do and was extremely helpful and responsive. That’s same day we were offered a housing.  Wish we were able to deal with him at the beginning and it would be 5 stars.  Thank you again Keith.</Text>

<rate>2</rate><Review>Keith Swimkosky gave me an incorrect move in date multiple times. And after I had already scheduled movers and planned out my move with my current residence he changed my date again even though I had already confirmed multiple times prior with him to ensure that this would not happen. Very disappointed in the lack of organization and the lack of help.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80d95308f3286d67:0x1de710bfd9567139<//Gmap_id>< time>

Moving to San Diego under some difficult circumstances (deploying soon after reporting) and Lincoln Housing was exceptionally professional and understanding about our situation.

Specifically our property manager Keith was nothing short of amazing and was able to get our family a home the day we arrive.</Text>

Had the pleasure of speaking with the professional staff at Lincoln and was shocked at how easy it was for me to get signed up for housing.  Not only did we get the location that we asked for, the amazing staff was able to get us in on a very short notice.  Lincoln Military Housing has made it a lot less stressful to find a home in San Diego.  They earned an EP in my book!<//text>

We love the assistance that Laura Gwynne offered to my husband and I.
She was super patient, professional and worked with us in finding a home that would be ready to move into within a month.
If your counselor doesn’t seem to be working with you I advice contacting Laura as she is a Leasing Coordinator. All you have to do is communicate with her what you need and she will help you.
Thank you Lincoln Military Housing.<//text>

The process here was extremely smooth. Walked in expecting things to be difficult, but the staff here worked to ensure that our time would be easy. Came out the same day with an offer on the house and signed the lease a couple of days later. Unless you can find a decent home signifigantly under the market, I would recommend giving Lincoln a shot.</Text>

Our housing counselor, Evelyn, was prompt in getting us the information and paperwork we needed and was amazing in making the transition as smooth as possible. She really seemed invested in making life easier for my family.
Before talking with her we were bounced around a bit, but always met with kindness and patience for our millions of questions.</Review>

This was my wife and I’s first time dealing with housing, and it was such a smooth process. Laura Gwynne was amazinghelping us and answering the million questions we had. She was quick and efficient with our paperwork and housing offer. She made the process very easy for us. I would definitely recommend any military friends and family anxious about moving into housing to give it a try, based on my experience.<//text>

I had the best experience negotiating a housing unit with the LMH staff at The Village at Serra Mesa. Many thanks to Keith and Marisabel who always provided me with professional courteous service and promptly followed up with me if I had any concerns. I'm currently a LMH resident at NAS Pax River, MD but in the process of PCS'ing. I definitely made the right choice on staying with LMH and feel that my family's transition to San Diego will go nice and smooth. Looking forward to moving out west!

My husband and I seriously could not have asked for a better experience with LMH. We arrived in CA and went straight to the office to apply in person since our orders were only given 3 weeks prior and we were moving cross country. We walked in with our documents and were helped by Marisabel and she was the sweetest. She gave us an offer today and we will be moving in tomorrow! We had so many stressful times talking with others about wait times and not being satisfied with housing but when we walked through our townhome today we couldn’t be more thrilled. So excited and so grateful for our experience. Very professional and timely with everything. 5 stars across the board.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>DO NOT EVER rent here if you have a pet. When we first got housing they told us we would have to get the carpets cleaned since we had a pet which was fine. They DID NOT tell us there would be a black light scan done. They only do this if you tell them you have pets and considering our neighbor had an undeclared doberman for months this doesn't mean much. My cat has NEVER gone outside the litter box. The tech came by the second time (after blowing us off the first time) and told my husband who was there that everything looked fine. Now a week later I have the property manager claiming the tech found urine and we now owe over $350 for the deprecated value of the carpet. I explained the tech said everything was fine and he LIED to me and claimed the techs have no interactions with the residents. We were also not the first ones to have lived on that carpet and no pet scan was completed before we moved in. There's no way they can LEGALLY PROVE that it was my cat and not some undeclared pet of the prior residents or a child that had an accident on the rug. This is UTTER NONSENSE and I am warning you they will scam you the same way if you rent here. RENTER BE WARNED.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< time>

We came home Saturday to an 87 degree house because our AC went out.  So, we called in a work order. Two days later and we still have no working AC. My wife was unable to make my favorite meal for Father's Day because she feared we might have a heat stroke if we had to use the oven for more than an hour. Why should I pay $2646.00 a month for this kind of service? Thanks Lincoln!<//Review>

Dealing with this organization was fine at first, but upon separation and move-out we have encountered startling levels of incompetence and unprofessionalism. It is no wonder the US Justice Dept. recently filed Civil Rights complaints in court. I don't know how these people received contracts with the government, but it should be terminated as soon as possible.

Hopefully things will improve some day, somehow.</Review>

Extremely rude customer service. They have such an attitude towards doing their jobs right! They are a bunch of confused people working there, don't tell you everything you need to know so you'll be running back in forth between their office and wherever to get the right paperwork because they DO NOT specify exactly what you need! They also tell you one thing and the next moment another completely different thing, which make things overly complicated. Honestly better off with off base housing (civilians) because with these people you're just wasting money and time.< /Review>

<Time>1532968723971<//Time><rating>2< /rating><text>EDIT: were 2 days away from moving in. Im very upset with Lincoln. I had to Call about 6 different times go get my lease emailed to me. I informed them in April i have an ESA animal. I knew they would need the paper but they never asked for it until i asked when they needed it? A week before move in the asked for it and said it needs to get approved before we can even move in and ot can take up to a month to get approved. Luckily I got approved within 4 days. Another issue is with our kids. One isnt on the lease, not yet adopted, and i was told it would not be an issue. Today, 2 days before move in, i get told now that it IS an issue and technically, my son who is 6 and has ALWAYS been with us, is NOT alowed to live with us .ARE YOU KIDDING!? And how did i find out? I actually read my lease before signing it and i called them to do their work for them.

I have yet to move in, but the move in process to the townhomes has been AMAZING thanks to Keith Swinkosky! He has helped me with anything and everything and is the nicest guy. I am super thankful that he has helped me and  my family and found the perfect address for us!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1528819492592, 'text': 'Good Morning Otto Family!

Customer services here is poor beyond recognition! Representatives here makes me feel my interests for housing is unwelcome and she pays scant regards to my selection process.
Don’t even mention the answering of phones! They never answer! Gave me loads of misleading and confusing information then saved a particular unit for their favorites. Very sad!<//Review>

And in the offset chance they do pick up they are so unbelievably rude I am left fuming. RUDE, RUDE, RUDE ALL THE WAY AROUND.

Lincoln Military Housing only cares about you until you sign the lease.  Then, it's all about how to milk you for more money.< /review>

It has been 7 months since we applied (August 2017) for housing but we are still on the waiting list. I have several friends who applied months after us and only took less time, one couple took  two weeks  to get a house. At first we were position 79 a month later we went to position 88, and now at position 56. It is ridiculous, i really  do not understand why.< /Review>

I’ve been coming here ever since I dislocated my shoulder and after I had surgery! I’ve have been take care of by a wonderful person named Emily! Emily had been the one who has been showing me and helping me with everything I needed to do to get better. She’s is a great person and has a good personality among the rest of her staff members working with and around her! Everyone at OPTM treats you with kindness and care! I would recommend anyone to come in and be taken care of by one of the PT members here. You have nothing to lose by gain back your movement! Thank you Emily and to OPTM for helping me get better and back to normal.<//Text>

I recent went to OPTM facing the possibility of total knee replacement surgery. I worked mostly with Tyler. After completing 12 sessions I am no longer thinking about a knee replacement. That's how successful I feel the sessions were. All the staff at OTPM were pleasant, friendly and attentive. I felt that Tyler was really responsive to my goals and the main reason for my successful treatment. So thanks,Tyler and OPTM.<//Review>

<Text>I am writing this review to share my appreciation for the physical therapists that I work with at OPTM. They are dedicated, thorough, and skilled in their professional expertise. All my numerous questions are always answered in detail and sometimes with visuals images. Leaving each session with confidence that I am making progress and specific exercises tailored for my injuries are extremely beneficial. I highly recommend OPTM! Thanks, Celeste, Ben and Phil.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I started physical therapy at OPTM in December of 2020 after surgery for a broken heel bone.  I have been working primarily with Todd (had a few sessions with Celeste-she was great too) and he has been extremely helpful.  Mine is a challenging injury to recover from, but I feel I have made great progress working with Todd.  He is very knowledgeable and encouraging, especially when I feel like I’m not progressing fast enough.  Highly recommend.< /Review>< user>

<review>I have been a patient at OPTM for about 6 months for my shoulder issue and have been working with Phil. He is a very knowledgeable therapist and was very good at explaining things. The aides that helped him always kept the environment fun and enjoyable. If anyone ever tells me about their aches and pains, I always recommend they come to OPTM because of the high quality of care I know they will receive here.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I recently worked with Ben to rehab a broken ankle.  Ben is expert in identifying the most important things to work on and tailoring exercises for me to do at home.  As critical, Ben's approach to PT helped keep me focused on progress, even when healing was not progressing as quickly as hoped for. If (when) I again need PT, I'll be back with OPTM.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

My experience with Ben and the staff have exceeded my expectations going above and beyond the treatment of my rehab. Prior to meeting with Ben my physical condition with my neck, shoulder, scapula and tennis elbows has been ongoing for quite sometime. I'm extremely pleased with my progression at this point and will continue to strive to reach my goal playing golf on a regular basis and fly fishing. I do need to mention after 6- 7 weeks of the deep tissue laser treatment for my tennis elbows truely works. I do not to have use elbow support straps at this time. I recommend OPTM to anyone who needs PT rehab treatment.< /Review>

They are  trained to evaluating each client to determine individual needs and then to prescribe a  therapeutic program to address the particular needs.Fabrice was my therapist and  taught me  stretching exercises to relieve my leg and back pain.  Highly recommend OPTM.<//Review>

I have a great experience with OPTM, Saratoga. They have best professional therapists, like Celeste Kim. They are very knowledgeable, professional, passion about what they do. I feel very comfortable to go the the place since I feel the clinic is very clean and safe during COVID. Laser treatment is helpful.

UPDATE:  OOPS!!!  This review is for Tyler V!!!!

I came to OPTM for relief from a foot injury.

Tyler!! provided outstanding service. His kindness and patience were appreciated.  I experienced relief from scar tissue pain after the first session and the exercises that followed.

I will definitely return if I ever need PT in the future.<//review>

I went to OPTM for a dislocated shoulder and received fantastic care! My therapists were Tyler and Emily and both of them really knew what they were doing. Tyler knew exactly the kind of exercises that are best for volleyball and heavy strength training. Emily was also very knowledgable and gave me great tips on fixing my posture.

Overall, my experience at OPTM was 5 stars and I definitely recommend it for anyone looking into physical therapy.<//text>

Several months ago I went to OPTM to help me address some issues I had been putting off.  I have arthritis in my back and degenerative discs so I assumed I would just have to live with my back pain, increasingly poor posture and breathing, and inability to enjoy golf anymore.  After working with Tyler my therapist for 3-4 months with treatments and exercises, I am so excited that my back pain is much less, I can get deep breathes when I want, my posture is much better and continues to improve and I am enjoying golf again!  I feel very encouraged by the results!< /Review>

After attending a free shoulder workshop I went to OPTM for a free evaluation of a shoulder injury that I sustained when I crashed while bicycling. Although I decided that I could manage my own recovery from the injury I asked OPTM to help me with some exercise-related big-toe joint pain. Tyler Vinson worked with me to increase the flexibility in the joints and gave me exercises to help reduce the pain to mild discomfort. The exercises also strengthened my left knee so that I can hike and bike vigorously. I am very pleased with the outcome and the therapy provided by Tyler. I very strongly recommend OPTM for your physical therapy. And they are very courteous and friendly too!</text>

OPTM is a fantastic physical therapy clinic that I’ve been going to for a few years now. Each therapist I’ve worked with has been very thorough in trying to understand the problem and work with the diagnosis of the doctor to help get rid of the pain and make me stronger. A big shout out to Tyler who not only helped alleviate problems I had in my lower back, ankle, and shoulders, but also made it a pleasure to go to the office with his friendly demeanor. If you have the choice, go here.< /Text>

<Review>OPTM is the PT office I have chosen for the past 15 years to rehab my miniscus knee tear and shoulder labral tear post surgery, nerve neck pain, tennis elbow, strained back, and on and on. Excellent physical therapist staff and support staff! They are thorough in their diagnosis, explain the course of treatment step by step, punctual, friendly, and my rehab has been successful every time!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Review>I am so glad I turned to OPTM for rehab after shoulder surgery.  Tyler and the team are professional, smart and attentive.  The facility is sparkling clean, light and roomy, with everything you would need to attack your rehab goals.  I have already made great progress and am starting on a helpful long term plan.

My therapist Thuy has done a fantastic job. She went into my problem in detail and explained each procedure. In addition, she always taught me exercises that I could do at home. My swelling has gone and I can walk up and down stairs again without problems. I am also very grateful to my podiatrist Dr. Douglas Robinson for his recommendation. Last but not least I would like to praise the always friendly ladies from the reception.<//text>

<text>I recently had knee replacement surgery and initially had in home physical therapy for the first two weeks which was very painful. After in home P.T. my surgeon recommended OPTM.  All of the staff at OPTM were super positive and friendly. I was incredibly  fortunate to have Tyler to guide my PT and thanks to him I made tremendous strides in rehab that put me way ahead of normal recovery. He was always mindful to craft workouts that focused on rehabbing weak areas, and never pushing pain to uncomfortable levels. I'm a little long in the tooth and am no stranger to the physical therapy arena, so I can tell you the folks at OPTM are a class above and I can't imagine ever going anywhere else!</text><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808e4aae43893119:0xbafb8c7b71e1241a< /gmapID></record>

Fabrice and team are great.  If you don't want to go in, they can coach you in your home via livestream.  That was fantastic during this last year.  Fabrice helped me with an injury to my sternum, helping relieve the pain quickly through stretches and exercises.  In the past, in person, they have helped me with my knees - stretching and strengthening muscles. I always have an 'Ah Ha' moment when I'm working with them.  Great team.</review>

I worked with Thuy to recover from a torn meniscus and build strength in my glutes and legs. Thuy was awesome- she helped me ease back into running after the injury and gave me lots of useful tools, resources, and information to prevent future injuries.</Review>

OPTM Saratoga is a very professional Psychical Therapy clinic. I have been there a few times over the years.  When I am done with my therapy sessions all my pains and aches are totally gone. More over, they send you back with a handful of exercises that will keep you fit later. Thuy Dinh was assigned to me this time. She is as good as they come. Not only that she knows her stuff very well, she really pays attention to your needs and concerns. Very happy and pleased with her. Thank you Thuy.<//review>

<review>OPTM is well organized and designs a thought out program based on the patient's requirements. Thuy did a great job of asking the right questions , with the appropriate follow up in order to target the right program for me. Through the program, I was able to significantly strengthen my core and promote better habits. Which in turn minimized by back pain. Highly recommended.< /review><gmapID>0x808e4aae43893119:0xbafb8c7b71e1241a< /gmapID>< user_name>

I entered the OPTM building yearning to repair some of the destroyed muscles around my scapular area. The therapists there practice social distancing well, and take necessary health precautions. OPTM is still open and helped me heal faster than any of the other physical therapy locations I have been to. The staff are kind, and always offer hand sanitizer when one walks in. Overall an amazing experience. Thank you to Tyler for helping me take more precautions while playing water polo and weight lifting.< /text>

OPTM was extremely helpful during a very difficult time. Since Covid, much like everyone else, I'd had to transition to working from home fulltime. In doing so, I developed some bad posture and exercise habits that resulted in severe sciatic pain.

Not only is my pain gone after only 2 months of physical therapy, but Tyler (my physical therapist) was able to equip me with tools, advice, and lifestyle changes to keep safe and healthy moving forward.

The treatment itself was great, and tuned to my personal situation, and they were extremely helpful in working around my busy schedule. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming.

In terms of covid response, they are on top of their game. From my observation, all staff wore masks, sanitized all exercise equipment before and after each use, and kept patience well distanced from one another. Seeing them take customer safety seriously made me feel safe returning each week.< /Text>

<Text>I am 72 years old and experienced my first injury and subsequent operation for a torn rotar cuff. Post operation, my surgeon referred me to OPTM for my PT.
Great facility and while difficult under COVID conditions the place was always immaculate and I felt 100% SAFE!
I was assigned Tyler and what an absolute joy to work with. I like to have dialogue and understand what was going on and why during the sessions, Tyler was more than accomadating.
Happy to say that I feel very close to 100% recovered for activities and I owe it all to a great surgeon and the physical therapy received at OPTM.

I had physical therapy sessions from April 2020 until August 2020 for an AC shoulder joint separation (top edge of shoulder ligament tears) that required surgery. I started off barely able to move my arm to chest height and by the end I was working on a light weightlifting routine with full range of motion returned enabling me to get back to my normal outdoor physical activities.

Overall the staff was 100% excellent. I had a primary physical therapist with a backup to help with my day/time preferences and the continuity of care was great.

This happened during our COVID-19 pandemic as well and they did a great job of mitigating the risks by social distancing in the waiting area, hand sanitization before/after sessions, temperature checks, and regular cleaning of their stations.<//text>

This was easy and seamless with the folks at the front office.

Thuy and Tyler listened to my needs and worked through to put me in a much better position than I would have been without their help.  I'd recommend them to others, they practice safe COVID-19 procedures work with my schedule and do a great job.  I also appreciated have 2 different PT's (only one per session).

<Review>Two weeks after full knee replacement surgery my home physical therapy ended.  I then signed up with OPTM in Saratoga for six more weeks of outside PT, and was assigned to Tyler Vinson as my therapist.  He was a big help and guided me through sessions twice a week.  I was a bit nervous with my knee still tender, but Tyler was very careful and everything he did was gentle but helped me make progress each week.  Nothing he did ever hurt, and after the six weeks I "graduated" and did not need any more outside therapy.  Tyler gave some exercises to continue at home, and I am now feeling great and back to a normal life.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808e4aae43893119:0xbafb8c7b71e1241a<//GmapID></record>

My latest experience with OPTM was at the beginning of Covid and I was pleased with their level of concern for hygiene and COVID protocols.  Tyler Vinson my therapist was professional, caring and knowledgable about my issue,  making me aware of the latest medical information and advising accordingly.  OPTM is efficient, courteous, convenient  and simply the best!!!< /text>

I had Tyler help me with a lower back pain in December and after 3 sessions improvement was achieved.  He taught me a number of effective exercises and I was even able to go to the ocean and search among rocks wearing a wetsuit searching for sea urchins.
I highly recommend Tyler along with other PT staff for their knowledge and professional service.

<review>I was referred to OPTM my my sports MD for exercise related injury.  I had separate exercise-related shoulder and knee injuries that were affecting my day to day function.  Todd and Ben worked with me for 5 months.  Todd is an amazing listener and is creative about creating a workout regimen in every session.  Finally, when the course was done, he ensured a smooth transition transition to a personal fitness trainer.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808e4aae43893119:0xbafb8c7b71e1241a</gmap_id></record>

< Review>
I had my total right knee replacement done in January.  A friend recommended OPTM Physical Therapy of Saratoga.  I began physical therapy at this facility after a month and half of home physical therapy support.  The program begins with a thorough assessment of what I want to achieve from my exercise.  I am very please to commend OPTM of Saratoga for the individualize program to help me maximize my motion, balance and strength on my right knee while also strengthening my left knee for future surgery.  During my PT session we have the lockdown because of Covid but that didn’t stop my physical therapy instructor from continuing the program.  I continue my exercise program through telehealth.  I want to thank my instructor Fabrice for the attention paid to my other knee which is also in need of replacement.  He evaluate the program to maximize my strength, flexibility and balance for my right knee but his approach also considers my weak left knee.  I highly recommend OPTM of Saratoga for the caring, consistent and professional service during my treatment.< /Review>

This was my first time having the need for physical therapy.  My doctor had referred me to therapy at the onset of my frozen shoulder symptoms.  Jamie and the staff at OPTM in Saratoga made my experience painless and actually fun.  I looked forward to my sessions and my range of motion in my shoulder quickly increased.  They listened to my needs and concerns and were also very flexible with my schedule.  I highly recommend OPTM for any physical therapy needs.</text>

<text>I've been to OPTM over the past few years for four different injuries.  Each time I have been pleased with the PT process and result.  Office is very well organized, easy scheduling and changes, and the PTs are great.  Great hours, too.  I like how the print out exercises w/pictures that I do at home to supplement the in-office work.  Highly recommend.< /text><user_name>Gary D<//user_name><Resp>None<//Resp>< user>

I worked with Tyler to strengthen my core and increase flexibility in hip and lower back to eliminate back pain, and allow me to play basketball 3-times a week.

Tyler's understanding of basketball helped him to craft a regimen of stretching: 90/90 hip stretch, kneeling hip flexor, standing fire hydrant; plus strengthening: lateral slides, box jumping and balancing.  The end result: minor stiffness that was previously pain, enhanced hip range of motion (from 20% to 40%), and a better understanding of how to align my body with my athletic activities.<//review>< Resp>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>All of the physical therapists and other staff are wonderful: They know what's going on with me and are available to help make sure that I'm doing my exercises right (no small feat!).  "My" therapist is attentive to how I'm doing and makes sure that my exercises are appropriate to how I'm doing. Just last week, she told me to hold off on one of my exercises until I get a bit more mobility.  She makes sure that I'm doing the work I need to get better and don't overdo it.  She also tells me, very clearly, how I'm progressing and what I should and shouldn't do.

This is the second time I've been there (both times for recovery from surgery).  My outcome for the first was complete and ahead of schedule.

I can't recommend OPTM Saratoga highly enough.</Review>< username>

I went to OPTM Saratoga with a persistent back pain, that I was suffering over several years. Dr. Tyler Vinson and the OPTM team worked with me over 10 weeks and was able to reduce my pain significantly from it being persistent to now being very intermittent. A big thank you to the OPTM team on helping improve my quality of life< /Text>

OPTM Saratoga is the best PT place in the Bay Area! They are very responsive and professional. Every therapist we have worked with has been really invested in finding the right solution for our problems. My daughters play sports and have had some injuries over the years and OPTM Saratoga team (Fabrice especially!) was so helpful in helping them to recover fast. We have referred OPTM Saratoga to many of our friends and they all had similar positive experience.<//text>

<Text>I started treatment because of severe pain in my left back. I had the pain for more than 1.5 years and nothing so far had helped. I got the best treatment I could ask for. There were definitely times, when I was losing my hope for recovery and wanted to give up. But my therapist kept talking me through the process - firm, kind and supportive. It helped. After 16 sessions I was finally pain free. I would never wait that long again until seeing my therapist at OPTM.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I was extremely pleased with therapy I received from Phil.  He helped me after rotator cuff surgery, for lower back problems, and for my knees.  I still do many of the exercises I learned from him on a nearly daily basis.  I just feel he was instrumental in allowing me to continue traveling and doing the active things that I like to do.  Thanks Phil.< /Text>

<Review>I went to PT here after my ACL replacement.

Ben, my therapist is a dream. Super easy to talk to and just full of advice on what's coming next in my journey to getting a working knee again.

It tafler does seem like everyone there enjoys what they are doing and likes to work there. This makes the unpleasant task of PT just a little bit easier.<//Review>< rating>

<review>I went to OPTM-Saratoga after I had Ankle Surgery.  I was able to get an appointment easily.  Everyone at OPTM-Saratoga was really great, from reception to the aides and the therapists.   My therapist was Fabrice, he was extremely knowledgeable as he explained every aspect of the treatment throughout all of my sessions.  I was back playing golf and exercising right on schedule with no limitations.  Thanks to OPTM-Saratoga and I would recommend to anyone in the South Bay<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<rating>5</rating><review>Finally found not only one, but a team of, physical therapists that diagnosed me correctly after years of seeing probably about 20 different therapists. For the first time in 8+ years I now feel I can manage my disc degenerative condition on my own! Had to go back for knees and saw results after the first two visits. Thanks to the whole staff, very friendly and professional. Extra thanks to Robert & Fabrice!</review>< Pics>

I'm so impressed with Pro Pacific. I had an unusual problem with my car and they went out of their way to help me resolve the issue. They are professional, friendly, honest and competent. Hopefully I won't have any more auto problems for a long time but when I do, I'm definitely going to take my car to Pro Pacific!<//Text>

I am not from around Humbolt, however when I was visiting a friend at CSUH my car broke down.I was freaking out because I needed to drive home to Sacramento. I called Pro Pacific and I spoke with Ford, he was so nice and he offered to have me come in and see what they could do even though they were fully booked for the day. When I got there I spoke with Tara, and I was crying and panicking and she really helped calm me down and explained all my options. Ford was there as well and he helped explain what was going on, he gave me "My friends dad" vibes. It ended up being a catalytic converter issue and I had to leave my car with them for about a week but they were in constant communication and updated me with any important info. When I did finally get my car back they were so nice and they really gave me a good price and I felt like I could trust their work. As a young girl who was not from the area, they took excellent care of my problem and I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs car help in Arcata. Ford and Tara are great.< /Review>

Travelling down from Vancouver Island on Hwy 101, vacation road trip, when my exhaust pipe failed. The only place open on Saturday I could find was Pro Pacific Auto. I stopped by in the morning and they were very busy and I could see a line up of vehicles and customers there. After explaining my situation to Bill, a technician came and looked and figured it might be patched. Bill squeezed us in and the job was done in about 1 1/12 hours. They did much more than a patch job using spare parts they fortunately found. They provided us with a shuttle to and from our hotel while we waited. Thanks for the ride Victor! An awesome bunch of guys, very professional and courteous. They bailed us out big time. Highly recommended! Big time!! Nice memory of Eureka! Good folks there!<//review>

We were in Eureka doing some work, when we experienced some significant issues with our Chevy Suburban. In great need of our vehicle for work, we pulled into the local Chevrolet dealership. Due to it being late in the evening, they told us they could not help us, but very politely and with confidence referred us to Pro Pacific Auto Repair.

Upon arriving at Pro Pacific, we were greeted by a very nice service advisor who was very understanding to our situation, with it being 4:30pm and with the issue we were facing. Another gentlemen said he would put a code reader on the car and let us know what the problem with the vehicle was. He immediately advised us of the problem, which was an issue with the fuel system. This gentlemen, Mike Bates, who turned out to be the owner of Pro Pacific, could not have more comforting, friendly, professional and most importantly determined to get us back on the road. He and his staff immediately jumped on the problem, they stayed overtime, and within one hour had us back on the road.

The best part of this experience was the honesty and integrity in diagnosing the problem, and the integrity in the cost of fixing the issue. I say this with great conviction, “that you all in Eureka are very lucky to have a great company like Pro Pacific Auto Repair.” A Big Thanks to the entire staff, especially Mike and Ford and the two wonderful service advisors. Bless You All and next time we are in town we stopping by, hopefully to just say “Hello,”< /Text>

They crashed my vehicle and didn't tell me. I found out after driving home. Called and talked to Ford, who said he was Manager. He told me it didn't happen and got very hostile. I drove from shop to home didn't stop any place. Had big scratch on my door. Then my wife seen there shuttle van has large damaged spot also.  Over charge for simple jobs. They changed me 30 plus percent over book time, plus fee for checking on the repairs. Parts are marked up over 50 percent from parts store. They suggested I change all my fluids at 30,000 miles. When I asked about manufacturer suggested maintenance. They advised me they don't suggest following the manufacturer maintenance schedule. They want you vehicle not to last long so you buy another vehicle.  Please do yourself favor and tow your vehicle to different shop. Not wreck and crash automotive repair.</review>

My 25 year old daughter went in to have her car looked at before she drove across the country to Connecticut and they charged her $1200 to replace alternator belt and have leaky rear wheel brake cylinders replaced and supposedly 1 rear wheel bearing replaced. What thieves!!! I hope you sleep well at night knowing that you took money from a young girl with none. You bent her over good! But you have to live with yourselves now.</review>

Came in on a cold Saturday afternoon with a broken window and a car full of gear trying to road trip down 101.  Every other place in Eureka/Arcata was closed or not able to help, but we stopped by Pro-Pacific and Rob and staff has us back on the road with a fixed window just 45 minutes and $84 later. Couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful and even diagnosed the (non-critical) intermittent check engine light that had come on with a full explanation of the problem.  Great little shop. Feel so lucky to have found them!<//Text>

I was a traveler in Eureka. I couldn't start the my van there on Satuerday afternoon due to the key loose traction. So I let AAA leave my car to it since it's still open by 4:30pm. From my point of view, the part under the steering to hold the key need to be replaced.

Monday I called them from home and get estimate $450 parts (I heard key bushing related parts) +2.5 hour labor. Total will be $945. The tech wrote parts at different price $524 on the sheet late.

I called Tuesday, was told that the parts arrived in the afternoon. Wednesday morning done.

I uploaded the 2-page receipt images. Please read them and correct me, if you think they did a good job and charged me at fair price. I'd like to listen to experts' opinion.

I also upload the image shows how they installed my odometer cover back with a gap from its original position. A labor fee $702.27 did such job.</Text>< pictures>

I called the shop and they walked me through getting my car safely to their shop.  It happened to be one hose that had a leak, they replaced it without charging me!  It was recommended that I have my hoses replace considering they were original and I had almost 250,000 miles on my little car.  They didn't pressure me to make my appointment right then but I called later to schedule it.  My schedule is hectic and they made it so easy by taking to work and picking me up when my car was finish.
I've never had anything but good service from these gentlemen.

Fixed my car, gave it back to me with no gasoline in the tank (I left it with half a tank), and a dead battery. When I asked why these two things happened, they tried to BS me about how it's my fault that the battery is dead.

Pretty lame, but at least they got the car back to me quickly.<//Text>

They were booked for the next 2 weeks and I had to be back in Canada in 4 days.

So because they were very nice to us and tried to help as maximum I came back the next day to ask for advices.

They took 20min to look at the RV for free and told us to try to change a part ourself which reveals to be the cause of the issue we had (if ignition switch).

I just want to say a big thanks to them and the consideration they gave us !</review>< Pics>

What a horrible experience. This may be a popular spot to take your vehicle, but I don't recommend it. Number one issue, they don't stand behind their work.

I had to take my truck to another shop to get it fixed after spending over $4,000 at this shop. They gave me poor advice on how to fix my issues, and kept recommending I spend more and more money. After they refused to do any more work without charging me more money, I took my truck to my trusted mechanic in Oregon who fixed the problem with one hour's labor and documented that Pro Pacific screwed up. Pro Pacific denied it, even though my truck runs great now and refused to cover the fix from the other shop. They over charge for parts, are poor communicators, take forever to try to fix things, and are overconfident in their own abilities.<//Text>

UNbelievable! They tried ot charge us $350 to replace the rubber seal on my gas tank, I took it to the very next auto shop, they quoted us at $140!!! They told us, the parts themselves only cost about $36, and their was no reason at all to charge $350 for it, I would not recommend this place.< /review>

<review>I went to this Little Ceasars location about 1 hour ago, and after eating two slices of my Pepperoni Cheesier pizza, and wondering why it was so dry, I discovered the pizza was made with no pizza sauce, and I did not ask for my pizza without sauce.  If I did not live too far away from this location, and having to miss out on the first half of the Superbowl, I would have returned and asked for a refund.  I will never go to this location again.</review>< pics>

<text>I requested a supreme pizza, lady said it would take 10 mins which took around 20 mins to top it off I asked for no olives because I'm allergic and they put extra olives, terrible service, awful employees, never coming here again, 20$ down to the garbage. To top it off, smallest bread sticks ever, flat 3 inch, I'm just gonna throw it all away, disgusting.<//text><name>Hazael Garcia</name>< user_id>

This location frequently forgets to listen to specialty orders and direction leading me to believe our schooling system continues to put the failures and losers at this location. Whenever my family mentions pozza i would rather pick pizzo's rat infested location than little caesar's.  I see now why they are doing a rewards system. They know cheapness can only go so far since quality and customer service is beyond abandoned. The only thing for icing on the cake is if the people working there were sick or otherwise lacked hygiene... oh wait they did to include a disgusting trash smell over powering the pizza smell. Not going here even of my options were eat it or die of starvation.</text>

I don't want to give them any star... I order 2 pizzas and wings... first the wings fall on the counter and the girl put them in the container  for the customers,  I ask the girl up front not to give me the wings that was on the counter, she gives me an attitude because I don't want dirty wings.
So when I got home I called to complain about how Ice cold the wings were, expressed to the "manager " the situation I just experienced.  He tells me that just because wings fall on the counter don't make them dirty  and all that matters is that they're  cooked..  He was an complete ass hole... the food service today was awful. The workers names supposedly Sebastian,  Melody and Miranda...

If my family gets sick off this food they will hear from me again and it this time I won't be so nice.< /review>

< Review>
Three days in a row I've tried to order here at 9:25pm, 9:20pm, and 9:30pm. Because of my work hours, it's difficult to order any earlier, but their sign CLEARLY says closing is 10:00pm. Everytime they tried to justify their laziness with either "no more dough" (ridiculous lie), ovens are being cleaned (during BUSINESS HOURS???), or just plain locked everything up to prevent people going in (this was at my 9:20 visit), and, quite frankly, it's deplorable. I'd understand if it was 15 minutes till closing and I ordered four or five premium pizzas, but I'm only asking for a two hot n ready's. I'm fed up with this place. The manager needs to be fired and replaced and employees with better integrity and/morals need to be hired.<//Review>

Got a couple hot and ready pizzas and orders of crazy bread. The crazy bread is really good at this location, it has enough cheese and is soft and moist unlike some other locations I've been to in the past.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) the pizza was already half cold but I give it 5 because my son likes a chingo and because it was worth going if it was open here in my area 92113 they are all closed 😡

(Translated by Google) We have tried in other branches and in this we did not like it much. They should know the same, but it didn't.

If you live in the Newport area you need to visit. This is a good place to learn what the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches. Several different sessions of church are held on any given Sunday. Also the church is Temple is located on the same grounds. The church is institute of religion for college students is also located here.< /Review>

<review>I have visited this Church every summer for 6-7 years now. As a visitor I always feel very welcome. Members of the congregation are very kind and inclusive. Meetings are very inspiring and Christ-centered. Great place for families with a nursery, primary classes, youth classes, and adult Sunday School.<//review>< Pictures>

A wonderful, friendly, family oriented church. Come for the first meeting or stay for all 3! There is a nursery for children 18 months+. Beautiful music, talks and scripture study. This is a Christian church who focuses on Jesus Christ and His gospel. All are welcome!</review>

< Review>
This is a great place to worship!  I love this building and I have so many wonderful friends here.
There are three wards that currently attend on Sundays; The Newport Hills Ward, The East Bluff Ward, and The University Park Ward.
This building is considered the Newport Beach Stake Center.
Everyone is welcome anytime!
Sunday meetings start at 9am, 11am, and 1pm.<//Review>

I love that everyone at church has the same mentality, that it's not a place for perfect people to show off, but rather a place for imperfect people to come together and help each other become better.< /Text>< Pics>

They had outstanding cuisines, the food was savory. The prawns were fantastic, pic below. And the popcorn had a wow factor. The overall experience was romantic and the waiters were outstanding.</Review>

The ambience and the concept are nicely executed here. The ingredients are seasonal, fresh and thoughtfully integrated into the cocktail and dinner menu. It was nice that they offered some nice mocktails to enjoy with our teenager. The rating is short of 5 stars because some of the plates and cocktails were really small proportions for high price (lots of ice in the cocktail tumbler and 5 smallish pieces of pork belly main). The service was energetic and enthusiastic and they did a great job with heating up the patio with lamps and a fire pit.< /text>

I don’t know that I can give an accurate representation of this culinary experience based on my personal discomfort. But the reason I’m giving it four stars instead of five was that the entrance was a little difficult to find and it wasn’t an extensive menu. I was having some stomach upset and their ginger beer was delicious. Of what I could eat, I really enjoyed the Brussels and cauliflower. I would like to go back and have the full experience but I was glad we were able to walk and I got a postcard out of it! I am the type to actually write postcards and still have some of my lunar landing postage. Thank you!<//Text>

<Text>Our waitress was excellent, very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks and very polite. The blonde hostess however, was incredibly rude and unaccommodating. Since that was our first interaction walking in the door, she gave us a terrible vibe and then we spent the rest of the meal trying to like the place. The young man she was training was far more polite and professional than her.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Favorite restaurant in Santa Barbara! The menu can change seasonally, but I have yet to order something I didn’t like. The atmosphere is so warm and cozy without it feeling like your grandmother’s house (not that anything is wrong with grandma’s, just maybe not for date night!) After eloping we had our wedding dinner here and the staff was incredibly accommodating and kind and the food was amazing! This is definitely worth the “treat yo self” occasion in Santa Barbara.< /Text>

<review>A perfect setting for an amazing experience. The cocktails, entrees, and service are on point. Our server was amazing. She was eager to answer all the questions that we had and accommodated to my girlfriend’s egg allergy. Her recommendations did not fail and neither did the food. Something as simple as beat salad had flavors and textures to die for. The beef cheek was so tender you could eat it with a spoon. To top it all off the drinks were  just what we were looking for. They had a twist on both a classic Manhattan and an espresso martini that will have me coming back soon.</review><gmapID>0x80e9138ecd07114f:0x3ed9f620e51dbf78<//gmapID>< user_id>

Loved it! Everything was ideal. I ordered the black manhattan and it was everything I wanted from a Rittenhouse drink. Then for starters the beet salad is an absolute must have. Two mains was too much for two people I thought, I wished we'd bebe warned about that a bit more because no heard dessert was so good, but I missed out.< /Review>

After having their fried chicken last night and served pink I wouldn't recommend that dish to anyone.
If that is how it is done be very careful of what you order.
They weren't very apologetic either for a mistake that is known to cause sickness  and for 28.00 should be perfect.
Oh Well live and learn.</Text>

Amazing service! Food is always fresh and very tasty. My partner and I celebrated our anniversary here and stayed for two weeks. We are absolutely satisfied with the service and food. Their staff was also very professional and friendly. The place was very clean and organized. It was a remarkable experience! We would definitely be going back.<//Review>

<Text>What a great dining experience! Ate outdoors here in the parking lot recently and enjoyed some truly exceptional food. The prawn toast with sea urchin bernaise was the stand out dish, and my cocktail (the Serenade) was absolutely delicious. I also very much enjoyed the mission fog tartine and the pomegranate braised beef cheeks. The only thing I didn't care for as much was the tagliatelle, which I found to be too salty, although my dining companion enjoyed it. Great ambiance in a super fun area of town, although unfortunately they have those uncomfortable metal chairs that seem so popular these days. Good service matching the food.

Looking forward to going back!<//Text>< Pics>

Very good place for outdoor dining. Roomy, comfortable, and great service. My wife and I arrive at 5pm on a Wed night. When we left around 6:30pm, this place is packed.< /review>

<Review>This place is my number one site.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to this restaurant. everytime  I I need a superb supper, this restaurant comes straightaway to my head. best and all sorts of  food and a large list of dishes.helpful staff, and pleasant mood. In addition to that, the pay is modest. I suggest this spot with great pleasure.</Review>< Pictures>

The take out setup is locked in. Got the fried chicken sandwich and the burger and they were both incredibly fresh and delicious.

Highly recommend. They also have spectacular popcorn with seasonal flavors< /text>

The staff was very helpful and friendly. Usually serving time more or less 45min to 1 hour. Wow! The most important thing was, the food was very delicious and it was very affordable. You should definitely give a treat to your friends or family here in this Restaurant! Very strongly recommended!< /Text>

Wedge could use a little less blue cheese and perhaps the lardon didn't need to be candied. Prawns done well though the eggplant compote again too peppery/sweet and a bit too extensive.

Dog friendly patio and good service/decor as well.</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMphM4uKVu0tWS-skE-hM7vLNPaB4q-nkirvZdB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNfGgzASYyyawC4CrhvAQnVUP_WzCfAXzS7xgoC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb_e27QUlxznp6FpyTQP08GFyDEAT2TI0UgZJ4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>A local and tourist favorite with a variety of dishes accommodating of dietary restrictions and general food preference. As a stingy non-foodie, it’s amongst the best for finer dining in SB worth the cost. It has a desirable location in the Funk Zone with valet service because parking is pain (even for locals). The five stars come from the management for assisting with a gifted dining experience. I had issues with billing for a gifted meal for family, but Kacey was quick and willing to assist afterwards<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Very good food! Fried chicken, Broccolini and Fig toast were all superb.  We would likely come back to Santa Barbara just to eat here again.  Seems petty, but docking this place a star because of tattoo on our server - she went out of her way to have it be visible as well -  "Eat the Rich". . .  Hummm, this place isn't cheap.  I would think this is a place dependent upon people with discretionary income?  Really turned us off.  It is too bad, she seemed nice. I don't need to see that.<//Review>

Just THE best all the way around. Total attention to every detail of the meal. Each dish is thoughtfully put together. From the first bowl of flavor dusted popcorn you will be hooked... to the sustainable sourced ingredients in every dish.   Not to mention the craft cocktails...pure 5 star all the way, a real class act.  A real living slice of Americana. Bravo Lark, keep up the amazing work..!<//Text>

This place is an upgrade of all senses. The ambiance, the food, the service: 100%. We had the Brussels sprouts, the ribs, the steak, the fried chicken, the pork chops and the mezcal-infused dessert and seriously lost our minds. This place is so good. Thank you.</review>

Meh. Nothing spectacular. This is a hip restaurant that tries to be innovative with their unique flavors and combinations, but they try to combine too many concepts into one dish and are just a bit of a miss for the price. As an example, the appetizer they serve is a dill pickle popcorn that has a sweet aftertaste... not really the best. Our server was friendly and our party had good drinks. It was good for a big group like ours in terms of outdoor seating, but the food didn’t make me want to return.< /Text>

OUTSTANDING, ACCOMMODATING, DELICIOUS
While visiting SB, we dined with the recommendation of some locals and we were NOT misled! The ambiance, service and food were top-notch. I have some dietary restrictions and spoke to the restaurant prior to visiting and they were very helpful to provide some suggestions so I knew a little prior to visiting. Upon our visit, our waiter (forgive me for not knowing his name) was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients. The chef was able to make a modification for the Hanger Steak accompaniment and WOW was it phenomenal and non-irritating to my indigestion. Thank you, thank you, thank you to all the staff for such an amazing experience!!< /review>

The Lark is a trendy place to have dinner and drinks. We stalked around waiting for a seat at the bar or communal table due to a 2.5 hour wait. Bar tenders were very nice and made good drinks and suggestions. Meals were served at different times which was less desirable. Management was also on their game as they calmly dealt with some snooty customers.< /review>

We really enjoyed our meal at The Lark tonight, we had delicious cocktails before our meal. The food comes family style, so in other words we shared all our courses. We started with the wedge salad. REALLY GOOD! Then we had a delicious burrata, beet salad. And for our main course we had the roasted chicken. Not cheap but worth the splurge.< /review>

<Review>I would love to give five stars but literally EVERY time I come here my latte is served luke warm. Frustrating because I'm sure it would be way more delicious served hot. Temperature aside this is still a good cup of coffee.  I order the Horchata Latte which is a delightful blend of horchata spices reminiscent of its cold counter part- iced horchata; if you are a fan of the iced drink I would recommend trying this one for sure!</Review><time>1613459309108<//time>< Resp>

<review>We ordered one of the "Family Dinners" using Curbside pickup.  I so much appreciate the curbside option during Covid.  The meal was fantastic!!!  We had Dinner for two includes: Roasted Butternut Squash & Fuji Apples, Cast Iron Roasted Cauliflower, Hand Cut Tagliatelle Pasta, Valrhona Chocolate Budino.  Everything was outstanding, except for the Tagliatelle which was mediocre.  Everything was packaged and presented nicely.  We brought it home, opened up a nice bottle of local wine, and sat by the fire and enjoyed a nice dinner.  Our entire dinner was $55 for two people.  For what we got and how nicely it was prepared, I thought it was reasonably priced. It was nice to have a simple pleasure during these very difficult times and support a local restaurant at the same time.</review>< pictures>

<Text>The ambiance is nice but not formal. Folks dressed from casual to dressy. Some brought kids, but mostly adult. Food was very good, service great. Many dishes were creative, so you will be trying new things. My dish was nice, but could have been more flavorful, which is why the 4 stars.

<Text>The food here was good. I went to a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 star rating due to their advertisement of being a family dining restaurant. Although each dish we ordered was excellent, the portions are nowhere near large enough to allow "family style" dining. So go and enjoy but everyone in your party should order an entrée. The cocktails were very good and the service very good as well.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80e9138ecd07114f:0x3ed9f620e51dbf78<//gmapID></record>

The herbed popcorn was the perfect start to many excellent dishes - crispy Brussels sprouts (slightly sweet, savory, umami), butternut squash and apple salad (crisp, refreshing, tastes like fall), and the most tender pork chop I’ve ever had paired with creamy farro risotto. As if the food wasn’t enough, the service was excellent as well. Highly recommend.</review>< pics>

We have a high bar for restaurants because we come from the Bay Area - Lark is good but a few of the dishes we had weren’t great. The highlight was the ribs cooked with pluot sauce. One person in our party got the Farro salad that turned out to be way too vinegary, so would stay away from that dish.<//Text><Time>1597775961574< /Time>< Rating>

Together with local wine we had a fabulous evening. When we left the waiter showed us a good spot for cocktails around the corner. To make it easier, he walked us down the road to point it out for us. Just class!< /text>< pictures>

Seriously delicious! This little place was a really nice find- absolutely delicious food, great service, and really interesting decor. I'd reccomend it if you're passing through Santa Barbara, but be aware, you might need a reservation if you go on a busy night. Still, I'd highly reccomend it!</Review>

Seasonal, farm to table, so the menu changes, which gives a new experience.  Always a favorite when we are in Santa Barbara. Can be romantic, a table for two in the garden by the fire, or fun with friends at the community table. Mocktails and craft cocktails are a must. The only downside to a later reso is that it can get loud with the mellenials.<//Review>

I found The Lark on several lists so I felt compelled to try it. We reserved an early dinner and I must say I was impressed from beginning to end. The service was great, especially helping with entree sizes which can be varied at nicer restaurants. They started us with some complimentary seasoned popcorn which was an appreciated gesture, almost extinct in the food service world today. We followed it up with the burrata, which was served with wonderful Ojai pixies and olive tapenade. We finished out the meal with brussel sprouts and the pork belly. Every dish had a great blend of both familiar and unfamiliar flavors like habanero infused pineapple. Also, the mocktail list was appreciated!< /review>

Great atmosphere. Waiters are very nice and friendly and will give suggestions. Brussels sprouts is the hit. Menu looks very sophisticated and kind of difficult to choose. Everything is tastes great. Great selection of alcohol 🍷 for sure. Separate bar available. Valet parking is complimentary and can get very crowded very fast. Place next door has live band music 🎶 which is very cool. Definitely place to try in Santa Barbara.</Text>

They expanded their seating area into the parking lot to accommodate more while keeping a safe distance. They allow dogs in the outdoor area. Asparagus dish was delicious, as well as the shrimp and summer pasta.<//Review>

This is a great dinner spot! By the time we remembered to make a reservation, there weren’t any available.  We came in around 5:30pm on a Saturday and were seated right away anyway.  I loved the ambience.  The servers were friendly and helpful.  I’ll usually get a meat dish but I enjoyed their vegetable dishes the most.  I highly recommend the Brussels sprouts and broccolini.</review>

<text>Phenomenal! The food, the service, the ambiance — this place is spectacular.  Billy and Jake were excellent bartenders.  Very knowledgeable, friendly, and a great sense of humor.  My dish was one of the best dishes I’ve ever eaten in my life. I’m at a conference and have told many people to visit this restaurant. Well done Lark!!</text>< Pics>

<review>Brussels sprouts are excellent - great flavor!  Also recommend the scallops.  A friend raved about the seasoned popcorn; but I'm not a big fan of popcorn in general and this didn't change that.  The atmoshpere is relaxed with both indoor and outdoor seating.

Great food and great service in a trendy downtown Santa Barbara restaurant. Our favorites were the crispy brussel sprouts, the bread plate with cheese and pepped vegetables, and the pappardelle pasta.< /review>

Outstanding food selections, individually custom crafted in delicious/eclectic fashion. A truly unique menu, highly recommend the scallops and the brussel sprouts. The artichoke buratta was amazing! The cocktail menu was also a delight, delicious choices, all hand crafted. We were a party of 6 at a delightful outdoors table, with fantastic service. Amazing place to share dishes farm/fresh style. Highly recommend this place!< /review>

<review>The food was amazing! We were there on a Monday night and it was rammed. The ambience, lighting and seating was excellent. Service was good. The flavour combinations were really well done and we loved the sharing concept. We did the sprouts, tuna, crackling chicken, pork and the peach cobbler. If anything, the dessert needs a bit of work, but the rest were brilliant.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Obsessed with this restaurant and we haven’t tried any new places in Santa Barbara because every time we make a weekend trip up we only go to the Lark. The cornbread is to die for, the Brussel sprouts are heaven on a plate, their ribs and chicken are also the best I’ve ever had. Even their alone pop corn gets me coming back for more!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Excellent food. Sharing plates here is always fun and is reccomended. Every plat we have ordered has been very flavorful and well presented. Service is attentive without being overbearing. It is a lovely restaurant and is always very busy. We do see families with children fine here but the clientele is mostly adults. Its a hip place that is very friendly. You will enjoy it. Prices are to the higher side. Reservations are highly recommended.<//review>

I love this place even if everything wasn’t perfect.  Server was the ideal balance of attentive but not hovering.  The artichoke salad I had rivals most things I’ve had in life and the panna cotta was amazing. Okay, so nothing is perfect and that showed up in the fried quail that was recommended to me.  It was all bones and fried bites.  Finding meat was a true effort that I was upset to exude.  Anyway, still love this place and would recommend to anyone - I think the fried quail was a fluke.  Everyone around me looked very happy and I walk away with a wonderful experience.  And final tip, try one of their cocktails to start and the popcorn is worth it.<//text>

<time>1563467190392< /time><rating>5< /rating><review>This warm and lively place serves outstanding food. There’s a serious level of attention to subtle detail - like pairing roasted Brussel sprouts with date to take away some of the sharpness, or serving an outstanding roasted chicken dish with grits and a side of watermelon to give a fresh mouth-cleansing accompaniment where the watermelon has been very lightly sprinkled with very fine salt to enhance the flavour and dampen the sweetness. Every dish was excellent and beautifully presented. We paired with very good local wines.
We sat at the large communal table which enhanced the experience. A genuinely superb meal for people who love proper dining.< /review>< pics>

We ate early at 6 p.m. so plenty of service staff who were more than friendly. The brussel sprouts were absolutely delicious but the cheese board was too mild and left us wanting. The pork belly was just the right amount of fat and savory-melt-in-your-mouth. The chocolate cake wasn't moist enough but delicious espresso whip balanced it out. The avocado sorbet was more like a palette cleanser than dessert but light and interesting. One of the best parts was the complementary popcorn at the beginning of the meal,  a perfect amount of butter brown sugar and chili spice. Quick Service with very courteous valets. Excellent experience, I would go back anytime and recommend this restaurant to friends  :)< /review>< pics>

Service great.  Food, not just terrible but disgusting.  Every dish our party of 5 ordered was highly salty, not tasty and overpriced.  We even sent back the Risotto because it was just a salty mess and after trying to eat it the first time, couldn't try a second.  The wedge salad was extremely salty and tasted like a caesar on overload.  The cured salmon plate had a white sauce that almost made us gag, as we passed it around the table because we couldn't believe how bad it tasted.  Ranks as one of the very worst food experienced we have ever had in any country.  I feel bad saying this, but it was the truth.  The service was excellent though, if that is any conciliation.</review>

<review>This is one of the must-go-to spots in Santa Barbara for dinner. The food is uniformly great, and they seem to pride themselves on having excellent servers who are both friendly and knowledgeable. So much so, that I let our server up-sell me on our second bottle of wine, and she was absolutely correct about the better choice. As in most of Santa Barbara, they aren't open late, and as we were still finishing desert, but the valet brought me the keys, not even waiting for a tip. I thought that was emblematic of the friendliness of this fine restaurant, and appreciated it.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Trendy atmosphere and trendy food.  All food served family style.  Portions are small.  Not a "restricted diet" friendly menu.  Good but not amazing, especially if you prefer to not share family style.  One big stand out was the Brussels Sprouts, which were outstanding.  I could have had just those for dinner and been satisfied.  Desserts had too many flavors going on for my uneducated palate.  I prefer simple food and my own plate of food at a restaurant.  Parking is horrible.  They do offer a free valet service so its best to use this if you prefer not to hassle with parking.  We ate on the covered patio during a decent moderate rain...awning leaks and I had water dripping on me throughout dinner and dessert despite trying to move awsy from the leaks several times...didn't appreciate getting a shower with my dinner.  Located in the Funk Zone its a good place if you are into trendy places and trendy food.  Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and try very hard to accomodate you as best they can.  Overall a nice evening though its just not my preferred style if restaurant.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Very unique restaurant!  When you eat here you need to remember that’s what is on your plate is meant to be eaten together.
Take little bit from each item and skewer it on your fork with each bite.  I promise you you will like it.  I usually eat one item at a time before moving on to the next; doing so at the Lark Will rob you of the full experience.
Seriously top notch place and I highly recommend.  Any questions, ask your waitress; they are extremely knowledgeable and will advise you on how to eat your food.<//Text>< pictures>

This restaurant was one of the reasons we knew moving to Santa Barbara from LA was going to be amazing. The food is fantastic. The attention to detail and the quality of ingredients shine through. Wonderful wine program and wonderful service. Great location. Surrounded by wineries, breweries, art and a tiki style cocktail bar. The Funk Zone is a great area to hop around and spend an afternoon.< /Text>

The Lark is one of the few restaurants in town that really serves exciting, thought out, seasonal tastes.  The salads are crazy good, and the house made jam that comes with the cheese board is fire.  Also the salmon spread with homemade salt and vinegar chips is ridiculous!  I could go on and on, especially about the desserts and drinks.  Sit inside at the community table if reservations aren't available.<//Text>

Very poor.  All the food was laced with sugar (or "caramelized").  For older guy trying to keep carbs in check this was miserable.  The chef is either a 10 year old kid that likes sugar on everything or hasn't learned how to cook without it.  I saw a lot of likes for the Brussel Sprouts but they are very sugary, may as well be eating candy.  Price for our group was $50 per head and the amount of food was pretty skimpy but since everything was sugary we didn't eat much anyway.  Won't go to The Lark again, I'll just go to the grocery store and buy a bag of sugar for a couple of dollars.<//text>

Hands down the best food in town. Family style dishes, each of them amazing, make for celebrating anything here so satisfying. You may pay a fair amount for the fill-up but celebrating here just feels right. You won't be disappointed with any meal you get here.<//Text>

Simply some of the finest dining SB has to offer. Great for special occasions, warm, comfortable, atmosphere, super attentive staff. The food will stand-out and stay memorable among so many fantastic options in this town. I go there whenever I can.< /Review>

< review>
We had gotten two recommendations to come in during our stay and it was highly disappointing. The host took forever to ask if we could sit on the patio or not and Our server was a female red head and she was very rude to us. (Wednesday night April 4) Barely checked on us, only spoke to my mom and not me. Did not even ask what I wanted to drink. And she treated the table next to us highly more superior. We were not dressed poorly either. We got the Brussels sprouts and chicken skin and the Brussels were okay but the chicken skin was so disgusting we couldn’t eat the rest of our food while the chicken skin was on the table. We are not picky eaters in the least but this had us nauseous the rest of the night. And when we told her we didn’t like it she kept saying “I can’t believe you don’t like it, what don’t you like about it”

So all in all it was very poor service with nauseating food.< /review>

We used to go here a lot, then we stopped going as much because a.) it seemed like the service and food slipped a bit and b.) we found some new favorites in town.  Well, we went back last weekend and I have to say it was as good as we remember it in 2016 or so.  I think the Lark is back!</Review>

Great atmosphere, delish food and pleasant staff. For a unique and creative experience from the bar, ask for Kyle, who loves what he does. Even on a busy Satursday evening, he obliged most willingly and enthusiastically to my request for an innovative drink. He concocted a beauty, although I only remember one ingredient: vodka.

Try the brussel sprouts as well as the carrot small plates. Both great starters.</Text>

<Review>Everything we had was sensational. The sun tomato salad with burrata, the brussle sprouts, oysters, the fish crudo and the tagliatelle. For dessert, we had the espresso vanilla ice cream sandwich. One of the best meals I've had in a long long time. Service was great and I would recommend anyone to go there.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODJ3-dUU5vpVd2rEF6L6XPols_2r0Tqk1yYnAC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxeVQu5ITgLwnPJxEq71PUAmx8o6_4Rlc5UHh0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

They serve a tasty but not inexpensive meal in a casual and fun space, with friendly service, great drinks and a good wine list, but I agree with the more critical reviewers that the Chef overuses salt and spice. The dishes are also too complex for their own good. For example, the Valrhona chocolate cake featured a delicious cake, which was complimented by spicy cayenne pepper ice cream, coffee mousse, a very sweet brittle and raspberries--far too many flavors to work harmoniously together. In sum, not refined dining, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless.</review>

This place lives up to the hype. Definitely a special place where you want to drop a few bucks and taste many things on the menu. Everything we had was absolutely superb and perfectly cooked. The cauliflower and branzino dishes were standouts. I was worried they would be small portions, but as a bigger guy, was very pleased that each each dish could easily be shared with at least two other people. People who don’t think SB is a foodie town overlook this place. Hope I get the chance to return soon!< /review>

My boyfriend and I made a reservation at The Lark for our 4 year Anniversary. We were not disappointed! Jillian was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us make amazing food and beer parings. I am a vegiterian and my boyfriend is not, The Lark catered to both of us. In all it was a refreshing and delicious experience. I highly suggest sitting on the patio, beautiful (And heated).< /Text>

<Text>One of the few modern gastronomic gems of Santa Barbara. Beautiful interior design with a casual seating masterpiece table as a centre for the  floor. The food is designed to be shared (as all good food should be in my opinion) and conservative in portion so you can try a few, unlike most SB portions I've seen so far. Wonderfully rich flavours and quality produce, you'll need to book or wait for a table on most nights. Confidently welcoming spice and drier flavors, the cocktails are a must try.< /Text><rating>5< /rating><GmapID>0x80e9138ecd07114f:0x3ed9f620e51dbf78< /GmapID><Date>1510094808560</Date>< user>

Bizarre hipster offerings - beef tongue, duck fat, etc. Chicken for $44.  Popcorn as a starter??
Our $16 'cheese plate' appeared to be skimpy leftovers from someone else's meal.
They'll serve water - but warm.  Pretentious.  But they did have a nice patio and a fire pit.< /review>

Excellent food and service. The beet and burrata salad was incredible, the beets were tender and flavorful, the dressing was flavorful without being overpowering, and complemented everything well. The burrata was fresh and sweet ish, and the toasted rice really set everything off nicely.

Also had the oysters that has shiso and basil seed, very good, and the tartare, which was also great. It was heavily seasoned but when combined with the flat bread, sauces, and pickles it was served with it mellowed out to a nice round experience.

Outdoor dining was heated and toasty warm.

Staff super helpful and friendly, while also professional and knowledgeable.<//Text>

<Text>So so. After 20 mins we finally got drinks ordered. After a huge and tasty order of brussel sprouts,  main courses looked nice.  Lamb ribs were pretty disappointing.  Mostly burnt skin and gristle on a bone.  Almost no lamb meat. Even the skin and gristle I bit off the bone had small bones I had to pick out of my mouth.  With one big piece of herb cornbread I didn't care to eat much of.  Ugghh< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The Lark was within walking distance from Hotel Californian where we were staying in SB. It was recommeneded to us by some locals that we're friends with. Its super close to all of the tasting rooms, so we were half buzzed by the time we sat down to eat but thought the food & service were fantastic. Everything is shareable and the atmosphere is super cozy! I highly recommend.</text>

All the dishes  (except the free popcorn) had way to much salt and spicy hotness.  Flavors of all the dishes were destroyed by both. We paid a lot of money for 4 sub par dishes.  I certainly won't be returning.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80e9138ecd07114f:0x3ed9f620e51dbf78<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Cracking dinner spot in the heart of Santa Barbara's urban wine area. We had been recommended the Lark by a number of friends, and were not disappointed. Firstly, it's very popular so make sure to book in advance. The cocktails are fantastic, the food even better. We sat outside in a beautiful garden and the service was superb - the waiter offering great advice on local wine and seasonal dishes. The crispy sprouts, crab gratin and lamb shoulder were particularly fantastic. Great place to meet locals and spend the evening, also right in the middle of where all the best bars are so sets you up for a night out nearby. Highly recommend.</Review>< Pictures>

The Brussel sprouts and cheese plate were great along with the steak and scallops. We were already full but when in Rome... So we ordered the lemon fritters with blueberry ice cream.

Absolutely amazing! Food, drinks, service, atmosphere were all top notch. Would go here again and again. Favorites were the wedge salad and the scallops (Oct 2017 menu). Sat outside on the side patio under the heater and it was perfect.< /review>

I left The Lark feeling the restaurant was trying to hard and missing the mark. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting. Patio seating is intimate and quiet, inside is more loud and energized. Service is great, with welcoming staff, educated food runners and bar staff. Unique things like old factory windows, to heirloom silverware and decor transform the space into a unique eatery. We started with the cheese board, which had a average selection of cheeses. All was tasty and complete but nothing that blew me away. Our 2nd was a warm summer bean salad which was our favorite dish. The dish had nice flavors that touched many of the senses and was well balanced. We got the dungenous crab risotto for our entree and this had nice flavors but had way to much oil for my liking and enjoyment. The fresh squash and tomatoes In the dish were yummy. The biggest disappointment was the dessert and the Valharona chocolate cake. It did no justice to the famous maker and was bland and lacked flavor. The goat cheese cream was so salty that I believe that they stubbed their toe with the salt, perhaps confusing the salt and sugar. Wine list and beverage list was extensive and had many options. Plan on about $40pp or $70+pp with wine.</Review>

the Hamachi crudo was good but the jicama slaw that came with it was meh and just not eventful.
The catch of the day was also uneventful.
It's honestly like the chef is trying to create these complex flavors that just miss the mark and believe me I enjoy fancy flavors and dinners quite a bit. Nothing spectacular for us and it's most simple dish was the best.  I enjoyed Bouchon and the Black sheep a hell of a lot more.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Came here with eight people for a birthday party. We ordered almost everything on the menu to share and it was ALL delicious. The brussel sprouts were my favorite - they were the perfect combo of sweet and savory.
The ambiance was delightful - we sat on the porch and it felt very intimate and charming.
The cocktails were good - I love the combo of tequila and jalapeño and their JP's Paloma did it right! I think that might even be their signature drink...
The waiter was super charming, attentive, and so friendly even after someone at our table insisted on splitting the bill up 16 different ways. Not even exaggerating. What a champ. We can only inspire to have his good attitude :)<//text>

Food is great, the ambience is Lovely but they don't have restaurant 101 down, like serving entrees at the same time. At a place this nice there's no reason that front and back of the house can't figure out how to time meals so that people can actually eat together. Also, no one should need to wait 15 minutes for a glass of wine.</Review>

Again, this is one of those places you have to try on the first day of your visit in case you want to try it again before the end of your vacation because it's soo good! Happens to me all the time and I always wish I had been there sooner. Everything we ordered was top notch and great atmosphere.< /Review>

Patio is beautiful and our waitress was wonderful. The atmosphere is lovely for a romantic dinner.
Food is fine although it could be better. The meat and fish dishes have too little fish and meat and too much other stuff...</review>

<Review>A total bummer of an experience. Sat at bar and seat was given away by bartender. Ordered an appetizer and then The bartender’s friends arrived. He quickly forgot my order and 45 mins later came back to me. After an hour total of waiting for a salad i left and went to Blackbird.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e9138ecd07114f:0x3ed9f620e51dbf78</Gmap_id></record>

So this place made top 10 must eats in Santa Barbara. I believe that list should be revised. I'll start with the positives; knowledgeable and friendly staff, fresh local ingredients, generous appetizers, and good drinks.

Alas, the negatives outweigh positives. Salt and sweetness are being overused. It's the first time I had brussel sprouts smothered in sweet sauce which just totally killed the flavor for me. Leave them savory, sometimes Simplicity works much better. We could not finish the plate and had to rely on free popcorn to cleanse the palate; perhaps that's the reason they serve it. In addition, leaving them in the trunk for an hour gave birth to the most horrible smell I have yet experienced. I really thought I would need detailing afterwards and had flashback of that Seinfeld episode.

I did enjoy the salads and was curious enough to try the $50 prime rib dish. Although the dish was good and creative I can't say it was shareable unless you fill up an appetizers prior. It just left me feeling underwhelmed and prices are not worth the attempt at creativity and the quality of the meal.

The Lark may serve better as I happy hour with shareable appetizers among a large group. But this is not a dining experience.</text>

There is some great food at The Lark! I am usually not a fan of kale but decided to give their kale salad here and I was not disappointed. Not exactly sure what it had but I remember thin apple slices, carrot slices, walnuts in the dressing and of course kale, it was truly delicious. Next we tried their ribs which were equally as good. The menu here is a tad bit different, their portions are sharing size so what you order can be split by two. The menu is separated into sections, so it would be starters, the main dish, and dessert I believe. Our waitress did a good job at explaining it to us. I had a great time!< /review>

This meal was devine. We started with him & tonics, not a drink I would normally order. They were delicious and very large. Every dish was fantastic, especially the Korean paella!! I can't imagine any dish being bad here.<//text>

The Lark is simply-put one of the best meals that my wife and I have eaten. We went last night for an early anniversary celebration and were greeted by an anniversary card on our table, well wishes from 4-5 employees, and two glasses of sparkling wine. That was the first testament to their 10/10-quality service.

Ignoring the top-tier service, the food was also a 10/10. The Brussels, stone fruit / burrata / cashew butter, and crab and gnocchi are all highly recommended. We aren't local, but will be back if ever in the area again.< /review>

<Text>Food was good, service was severely lacking. Made a reservation a month in advance, checked in 10 minutes early, was told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. After 25 minutes of waiting we checked back in and were seated immediately. Think they forgot about us? We ate here about 4 years ago and were blown away by all aspects of our experience. Tonight was seriously disappointing. Server seemed to not like his job, and didn't explain anything. Appetizers, drinks, and meal all came out at awkward times, and we were left asking ourselves "what happened to this place?" Meal was good, cocktails were ok, service was bad. Sad to think we probably won't come back.</Text><time>1531116324301</time><gmapID>0x80e9138ecd07114f:0x3ed9f620e51dbf78<//gmapID><userid>101136125937434453314<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Dinner starts with an old milk bottle filled with tepid water. We had been wine tasting so we weren't ready for more drinking. I had to ask for a glass of ice because warm water doesn't work for me. Service was attentive. The ice arrived promptly. I sent the crispy Brussels sprouts back. Way too salty. The duck liver mousse arrived on blackened bread. Burnt black charcoal bread didn't pair well with the superb duck liver mousse .Sent that back. It came back on bread. The kitchen can't make decent toast? Whatever. Next came the Spanish grilled octopus with couscous served on a wood plank. Arrived cold. The chili rub really overwhelmed the flavor of the octopus. All I could taste was chili. The couscous with blood orange was decent but cold. Next came the grilled marinated hanger steak served with charred broccoli. I'm sorry, but 3 tiny pieces of meat for $16?
Way overpriced and just OK. The marinade just wasn't that good.  Ryan (the manager) apologized and didn't charge me for the Brussels sprouts & duck pate, which I appreciated. Real trendy spot but I'm sorry, the food is overrated. Too bad.<//Text>

Why is it good please tell me? What’s your criteria? The food was so bad like how can it all be so overly salty and sweet and flat with zero character in  the same time? Plus stuff didn’t want to hear that. Sorry but was very disappointed<//text>

I'd give 10 stars if I could! Everything about the Lark was remarkable! The service, the food, the ambiance, the architecture, everything. RJ was our server and he gave us an outstanding experience! We were celebrating my Dad's 70th Birthday and he went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed, taken cared for, and happy. We as a family shared one of the best meals of our lives that night and gained so many magical memories. Thank you to the Lark for such a superb evening.< /text>

Tapas style restaurant. Great friendly staff. I'd recommend making reservations if you have a party larger than 4. (Even with 4) My personal favorite was the steak and brussels sprouts!<//Text>

What a wonderful experience!! Went here for a party I was throwing my sister, and since there were a lot of us we had a set menu to which on the table they included personalized menus with her name on it! The decor was beautiful and cozy, food was DELICIOUS, and the service was so attentive. Could not recommend this place more!!</Text>

<Date>1530251951682<//Date><rate>3</rate><review>There are two sides to this review! Food was very nice, well presented even though most savoury meals included a fruit of some kind which for me is a no no!

Staff were friendly and there were many of them! The place was bustling and must be popular!

I did find it a little strange that we got there and they told us “we like to do things a little different” - they suggested we choose 2 or 3 dishes so we went for a cheeseboard as a starter in addition to the sea bass for me and pate dish for my wife.

So they served the cheeseboard and pate first up - only when this was finished did I receive the Sea Bass which I ate on my own which was very odd indeed!

I don’t get the need to make it a sharing experience unless there are many small dishes like Tapas - it just led to a very disjointed meal as tasty as it was!< /review>< Pictures>

The few times we've been the food was good but service could have been better. The wait staff will try and pressure you into ordering everything at the beginning, stating that the kitchen staff will time things for you. This ends up resulting in the food coming east too early in what seems like an attempt to get you in and out of the restaurant. Portions are also bigger than tapas, so if you want dessert only order a few things to share. Our waitress the first time made it seem like they were small bites, which resulted in us ordering to much food. Service is a 2 1/2 but the good is 4.5-5< /Review>

Always an amazing time when my boyfriend and I go to The Lark. We always get one item from each Column so we can get a taste of everything. But tonight we didn't do a platter cause we wanted more of just small plates so we did; Brussel sprouts, asparagus, scallops, duck liver mousse and pork belly  Everything was amazing, I always love a great duck liver mousse. The scallops with the squid ink couscous was amazing. I want to just go back for that.  We even got dessert which usually we don't cause we are always full after the big dinner. But they have a deconstructed carrot cake that is out of this world! Love that the menu changes too, so when we go every 6 months to a year we always have a different experience. Ian our server was awesome as well!< /Text>

We had our anniversary dinner at the Lark. Our server, Taylor, was excellent. The tables are a little close, but you can't hear other conversations. The food is not only pleasing to the palate, but each dish looks as if an artist gave instructions.  5 stars all around.< /review>

Small portions, sometimes offerings are a little weird. Clams with more minced pork than clams, a cheese dish where it's basically fruits with a diluted cheese dip and a small slice of fish. Not bad, but a really just a tad too expensive for too little. Great service though< /Review>

The beet salad was beautiful. The communal table was a 5 minute wait, versus a 3+ hour wait for a regular table on a Saturday night.<//Text></record>

The busy kitchen pumps out an original menu that is sure to please. It's definitely a $$$ restaurant, but well worth the cost.

You need to order the oysters.</Text>

I was on the waiting list for 40 minutes. The hostess forgot about us although we were on the seating list. There were  several tables available and we didn't get seated.  I had to ask twice to get seated as she forgot again. The waiter took 10 minutes to tend us after we were seated, nurz</Text>

I havent been a while and was concerned about new items on the menu, but I loved it all. The flavors are outstanding. Loved the avocado icecream, I couldn't believe how dalicious cucumber can be with mint and icecream. Thank you, The Lark, you always entice me with new unusual exquisite flavor combinations. I'll be back again soon. Great place for a special dinner for two.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80e9138ecd07114f:0x3ed9f620e51dbf78< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Absolutely yes and yes!  Super hipstery and chill atmosphere.  Servers are super friendly and oh so attentive.  Music choice is superb.  Tried the roasted brussel sprouts with dates and I fell in love! Who came up with that idea??  Also tried the chicken chicharon and was impressed with the sweet and sour combination.  The smoked lamb was so flavorful and the dessert we tried, mocha something was heavenly.  We closed down this place and we were not even rushed to get out.  Strongly recommend!< /Text></record>

<review>Absolute disaster right from the start...Jazz our waitress took a long time to approach our table after we sat down. "Ill be with you in just a moment" would have been a wonderful gesture. Didn't happen. We ordered 2 cocktails - 2 appetizers and 2 entrees plus a bottle of sparkling water. I will list for you everything that went wrong:
1) We were brought tap water instead of sparkling water.
2) Our appetizers arrived before our cocktails offering us NO time to enjoy a drink before dinner.
3) It took 3 trips by Jazz to get my cocktail correct.
4) Before we were given the opportunity to finish our appetizes ..our entrees arrived.
5) We were never offered another cocktail..or another bottle of water.
6) When our appetizer plates were removed Jazz took our fork and knife...we now had our entrees with no utensils to eat our food. As our food got cold my husband had to get up and find a table to retrieve utensils.
7) I asked for lemon for my fish which did not arrive till our meal was over.
8) My trout just didn't taste that good! That was what the lemon was for!

The only thing we enjoyed were the brussel sprouts and the ice cubes were cold enough to cool our water!

Stop trying to be hip ... Stop trying to be cool and trendy and focus on teaching your staff the basics of customer service.

My nephew who lives here said The Lark is over priced ...Over rated and as a local would NEVER eat here. We should have listened to him.

Do not eat here ...You'll be very disappointed...

As a consolation our cocktails were on the house.

It didn't help!<//review>< pictures>

If a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars and impeccable food is 5 stars then this is a solid 1 star but that's unkind.
There is 'champagne' on the menu which tasted liked prosecco.
Cornbread overly sweet tasted like cake.
Oysters over done with too many herbs and granité. Actual oyster good.
Main courses heavy handed and potato salad served with ribs undercooked.
Pleasant service and dining room.</text>

<date>1523735299420<//date><Rate>2<//Rate><Review>After all the hype and enthusiastic recommendations online for this restaurant I was disappointed by it's lack of originality, over packed environment, unfriendly service and bad music bad music..

The food was less than inspiring. Served family style.

We skipped the brussel sprouts as even though it's the main attraction (what mainstream hipster restaurant hasn't got brussel sprouts as their main attraction since 2011??!). We shared the spring veggies, which were overloaded with chickpeas and doused in the "flavor of the moment" cumin, which overpowered what could have been a nice fresh dish. The hamachi was very good, a really nice combination of flavors, that were thoughtfully put together, although the melon wasnt fully ripe, but still the best part of our dish. Finally the duck wings were crispy and spicy but overall lacking in meat and in the end we both gave up as it wasn't worth the effort.

The drinks were good and we loved the free popcorn it was salt and vinegar flavor a nice snack while we waited on our dishes. After asking for a little more though our server never returned 😅.

Overall the decor and ambiance echos any hipster feel that has been going on for years in Portland, SF, LA and Austin, it's a shame the restaurant doesn't embrace a more unique Santa Barbara feel in it's design and menu.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I was going away by the uniqueness of these dishes. The combinations were flavorful, inventive, and downright delicious. This is a farm-to-table restaurant with a great reputation and I especially like the barbecued ribs with a citrus and tangy slaw! The brussel sprouts were delicious, the white chocolate brulee was delicate, and the beignets are also heavenly!

Note: Sorry if the pics are a bit dark... We we're outside around 8pm. Thx.</text>

I ordered the branzino fish with kale and risotto.  Market price was $38.  The fish was overcooked, the kale undercooked -- I do not know where the risotto went because I was too busy hunting down the fish under the mound of kale.  Overpriced.  Service was excellent, however I won't go back.<//review>

Overall disappointing experience, since we had traveled from San Diego and made a weekend of it just to eat at The Lark.  Our server was new and unfamiliar with the wines and menu.  She clowned a bit to cover her lack of experience, which took away from our dinner together (my husband and I.)  So it all became about her.  The food was merely ok --   certainly not San Francisco calibre.  It's been a month since we ate there and I can't tell you what we had, except for a tough, uninteresting steak and lackluster pimento cheese with a few measly croutons.  The tables for two are insultingly small, especially for a restaurant that only serves shared plates.  The one standout was our Brewer-Clifton Pinot.  The atmosphere feels like a chain restaurant, which is sad since the design is so lovely.  I will say that we like The Lucky Penny a lot and also the wine shop and wine bar behind The Lark.  For them I'll give two more stars than The Lark deserves.<//Text>

Fantastic New American fare in a trendy venue, with a chef's table. Parking is tricky though valet is offered.< /Review>

< Review>
As part of our road trip across california my fiance and I stopped off here for dinner this evening. We were glad to have made a reservation as it was very busy. We bought a bottle of wine to sip on whilst we waited for our  table to free up (cheapest sauvingnon blanc..and it was delicious) . The menu had so many delicious options.. we were spoilt for choice. But we went for the Brussels spouts  (delicious signature starter), steak tartar  (again yummy), the burrata  (peaches cheese and praline...absolutely divine), the pork belly (3 ways and smoky crispy goodness with a peach and nut brittle) and the lamb ribs (falling off the bone). Would definitely recommend to anyone! Wish we could go again. Rich and lucy from England<//Review>

This restaurant is a little unreal, and I love it. First some background - The Lark took over the old Bay Cafe space in the Funk Zone. The Funk Zone has been going through it's "renaissance" for a number of years but I feel only within the last one year has it really come together. The Funk Zone is like the Brooklyn of Santa Barbara. It's a little grungy and kitchy but things are really looking good there.

I went the week after it opened and it was packed with people. Their parking lot was full and they were offering valet parking, which is a good thing since there's nowhere to park in that neighborhood. We sat outside and while it was chilly, we were under some decent heatlamps. There are also fire pits and blue blankets you can use if you are cold.

Everything is family style and meant to be shared. Our waitress was very knowledgeable but a little pushy on the upsell. Luckily, we resisted her charms and didn't order one of the large entrees. We still had plenty of food though. Alot of the dishes came out in the wrong order and they gave our scallop dish to another table altogether, resulting in at least a 20 minute delay. There was no offer of comping a drink or dessert (easy things to do).

The mixed drinks were good (but not great). The food was excellent and the desserts really were some of the best in SB; really inventive and interesting with multiple layers or flavor and textures.

You should definitely go check it out if you are into a leisurely meal. Make sure you account for parking.</Text>

<Response>None< /Response><text>TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE

We arrived as planned but the restaurant let us down and then said we had to wait 2 hours  for a table we had booked as a special 50th Anniversary treat

This was a very special 50th birthday party that was ruined with my wife in tears as a result

We will be issuing suitable social media reviews about the Lark and how there pompous staff treat us, with no care what so ever

2 hours to wait for a table, honestly ???

Terrible service, will never go back</text><UserId.>111210131793633338248<//UserId.>< Name>

<Review>Made a reservation 3 weeks in advance for a party of 8 they call one day before and say their reservation system has crashed and the only exception is at 5 PM our 10 PM.  What a way to run a business they must have a lot of customers so they can cancel parties and 8 at will< /Review>< Time>

(Translated by Google) Good and recommended restaurant in Santa Barbara. Good selection of food from meat to fish. Vegetarian food is also available. The staff is friendly and always helpful. There is also a good wine selection.

(Translated by Google) Nice and modern place, it offers a wide range of wine choices and about twenty dishes to choose from, too bad that like almost all American restaurants it has the kitchen that closes at about 10 pm, for tourists from southern Europe, a hair too early

(Original)
Locale carino e moderno, offre una grande vastità di scelta di vini e una ventina di piatti da scegliere, peccato che come quasi tutti i ristoranti americani abbia la cucina che chiude alle 22 circa, per turisti del sud europa, un pelo troppo presto</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Above standard rating. The place (environment) is very nice, the service is careful, but the food is regular. Unfortunately it did not meet the expectations that the ratings brought.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Local with a lot of charm and very good food. Highly recommended homemade pate. Wine price increases but the premises are quite rich.

<text>(Translated by Google) Good food, although the wine list is a little inflated in price. The service is correct, perhaps a little false in its forms but after all it is widespread in the US. For that reason the waiters look for the famous tip. Brussels sprouts are recommended as an entree.

(Original)
Buena comida, aunque la carta de vino está un poco inflada de precio. El servicio es correcto, quizás un poco falso en sus formas pero al fin y al cabo es algo generalizado en los EE.UU. por razón que los camareros buscan la famosa propina. Recomendables las coles de Bruselas como entrante.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Pathetic, expensive, tasteless, small portions, good service, suitable for dating to middle-aged people.
