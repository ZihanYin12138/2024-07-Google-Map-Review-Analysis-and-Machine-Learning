< review>
Ordered 8 wings, a gyros combo w/ salad and asked the guy to charge me $5 for a tip over the phone since I was stuck in quarantine and couldn’t come in contact with the delivery person. They charged me $37! The menu I have makes that purchase $27 with the tip. When my order arrived, I was hoping for an itemized receipt to see where the extra $10 went. No such luck. Enjoy my money. I’ll never go back there again.<//review>

<review>Definitely convenient if you live on a naval base but otherwise, the food is very sub-par. Prices are way too high for the quality of food put out by this place. Lots of memories eating it, simply because this is the only place you can order food from and they’ll deliver on base. Thanks for the memories. But fix your food.</review><name>MKC Gaming</name></record></dataset><record>

This place is a hidden gem 💎  I always add extra cheese to my pizza and it comes out great 👍  I don’t order from anywhere else! Better taste for half the price. Thank you! PRO TIP: Call in your order & it will be ready by the time you get there😁📲</Review>

Never ordering from here again.
They send a pizza that was bunched up and just messed up in the box like it was thrown in the trunk of a car to where half the toppings were just a glob, they sent the wrong kind of pizza from what i ordered but still charged me the same price even though the one I got was cheaper on the menu, and the wings had the wrong sauce on them too and had soo much powder or whatever was on it i ended up throwing it away it was soo bad.
I don't ask for much in life, but when i spend months on end in the ocean and all I want is a correct order (not even a great pizza, I know the quality i am getting as Giant Pizza King already has a reputation on the naval base for low quality) well if it were not for the fact that your the exclusive company that delivers on base I could not be surprised if you went out of business. That's all the energy you get out of me. Im going to Costco, at least they get their orders right.< /text>

I just got back to the states after being deployed for a year. I got a giant pizza for the whole work center. As the name implied it was huge and fed 8 of us! Just wanted to give my thanks, meant a lot to us and was delicious!<//review>

If you expect food to be delivered at your door 2 hours later to be hot, I'm not sure anyone can meet your expectations. I got my food, went to a new restaurant opening, and ate my sandwich about 5 hours after. I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich, Kalifornia Fried Cauliflower, and Fried Avocado.< /Text>

Giant Pizza King has been there for about 20 years, and still is the best. Their pizza is DELICIOUS. The people who work there are really patient and nice. Today I bought the $5 large pizza slice, it was extremely tasteful. It was fluffy, cheesey, and enough pepperoni to give it a tiny kick of hot. I recommend it to everyone who lives in that area. Especially, for parties, the giant pizza.</text>

The $5 large pepperoni pizza is a great deal. I bought some wings also (8 of them for $7.99)...they were average...a little chewy. I would reccomend that you stick with a pizza (or 2), you can get a large all cheese or a large cheese and pepperoni for $5 each. The pizzas are made to order, so be prepared to wait about 10 minutes...but it's worth it to get hot, fresh pizzas at this price! The staff are friendly too. I will definitely  be back for more. 😊👍< /review>

I ordered pizza for my daughters Birthday. The gentlemen taking my order repeated my order. My husband picked up the food and they made a mistake on my order. They ended up just putting some pepperoni on top of the pizza which didn’t taste the same. On his way out the lady asked my husband if he paid $130+ he said yes I did. The female worker rudely tells him well I won’t charge you those $7 for the pepperoni I added.</Text>

I ordered a pizza over 2.5 hrs ago and still haven't gotten it yet, would never recommend this place to anyone. The pizza is absolutely amazing but the delivery is worse than any other place in sandiego for sure

*** Update it's now been 3 hrs since I ordered the pizza and it still hasn't been delivered. I called and the manager said the pizza was still on the way

** Update after four house of waiting, I finally received my pizza at 952 after cancelling my order and placing another one.... This place sucks, the driver's suck and this experience ruins pizza for the rest of my life</Text>

Placed my order online, waited close to an hour, called the restaurant to get an update and the guy said that my order is not in the system. He didn't even apologized or tried to get to the bottom of my situation. I hope that the management can upgrade or at least train the staff on proper restaurant etiquette/customer service.<//Review>

<text>Good pizza at good price. The place needs a little touch up (it feels outdated), but they have good and friendly service. The pizza is flavorful and the dough is soft and yummy. I usually don't eat the edges (crust) but with this one I didn't leave any on my plate. I would recommend for a cheap and hot meal.

Really wish we could post zero stars..ordered a pizza at 4:12. As of 7:50...15  phone calls later (6 of them they never answered)..5 times we've been told the driver will be there any minute..still no pizza. This is not the first time they have done this. I would love to comment on how hot and delicious the pizza is, but every time we've received one, it's been cold and old. If you've got time to kill and have already eaten, go ahead and order delivery.<//text>

<text>Ordered a pizza from here a while ago, got a deal from their flyer and everything went smoothly. called again to place the same order a couple weeks later, was told that deal is carryout only(its on the delivery side of the flyer) and that it was 10$ over the listed price. the only thing i asked different was that there be ham instead of pepperoni(flyer says 1 topping). they wanted to charge me for the pepperoni and ham even though i wasn't getting the pepperoni. seemed shady so i decided to not order. probably wont order again.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1558352227083, 'text': 'Aaron, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review.

Ordered online about a month ago everything was good. Came into the restaurant a couple weeks latee and order took longer than told, ok no problem. There were hobos hanging out inside, tables and seats were dirty! Also wearing sandals well working in a food environment is unsanitary! Wings were dry, ranch I was given was rotten, I'm sadden because we like your pizza! But this is bad.<//text>

<text>Very nice quiet pizza place in an unsuspecting shopping center. We go here regularly. The service is on point along with the taste. The price is pretty good. 10 bucks for a decent sized pizza.</text>< Pictures>

1st and last time i buy from them! Ordered a giant pizza and 2 orders of wings(12pcs). I drove about 10 mins to pick it up and paid $56 dlls, when I got home i noticed i was missing 2  wings. I know it might sound exaggerated to make such a big deal, but i called the place only to tell them my experience so they would pay more attention. After waiting about 5 mins on the line the person who i spoke to me was overall rude! He said u payed too much cuz you had too many toppings; which i responded I wasn't arguing about the price, that I just had a suggestion. He said "oh well so i owe you 2 wings" which by then it didn'atter nomore! Customer service sucks, you shouldn't own or work in a restaurant. I'm pretty sure if i was short 5 dlls on my money you would not be so careless. And the pizza it self had no flavor, so I am never going back.</review>

EVERY FRIDAY I ORDER DELIVERY A GYROS COMBO COMES WITH A DELICIOUS GYROS WITH CUCUMBER DRESSING , TASTY FRIES AND A SMALL GARDEN SALAD $5.99 AND A SLICE OF CHOCOLATE MOOSE PIE IT'S A SLICE OF HEAVEN. THE PEOPLE A VERY NICE AND ALWAYS GREET ME WITH A SMILE. THE PIZZA IS WONDERFUL AND SO IS THE MEATBALL SUB COMBO. YOU CAN'T CALL ANYWHERE ELSE FOR GRATE FOOD AND DELIVERY AT A GRATE PRICE.

I ordered from here strictly because of a $10 off coupon even though the pizza is ok at best. I show up to pick up my food, the manager Mike wouldn't honor my coupon because they just dont and said he'd rather throw the pizza in the garbage than sell it to me for $10 off.  I asked if he'd rather me not come back as a customer over the $10 and he said that was my problem.< /Review>

Don’t order from here !  I was so upset today!
I ordered my pizza online on their website for lunch at 11am hoping to get it at 12pm. I called to see what was going on because  it was taking forever . Long story short, they delivered the pizza to another place 2 hours later ! My co workers and I ordered the pizza to have a Valentine’s Day lunch. The Giant pizza king place said they had delivered it and that someone had signed my receipt. My coworker had to go to the buildings across the street to see if someone had taken our pizza. Yes, we were that mad and hungry , our order was around $50.
And yes, another building received our pizza!!
I called Giant Pizza King and they didn’t even have the courtesy to at least give me my money back for the bad customer service. They wanted to charge me for another pizza and for me to pay them in cash because they couldn’t do a refund because the pizza had been delivered. When it wasn’t even delivered to the right place ! It was ridiculous!!! Giant pizza king employees ended up showing up to my work place. They stated that they went to the place I put on the online order. They couldn’t admit they just gave my order to the wrong building . Not once did they apologize for the inconvenience or the horrible costumer service. They were both upset and since I was already back on the clock , I told them to just leave. Terrible service !< /review>

<Name>Dani Knotts< /Name><review>Absolute worst service I have ever had. Got a text message my pizza was delivered went outside and no one was there. Waited for 10 minutes before calling and was informed that they called and when I didn't asnser they left even though I never actually got a phone call. Ithey said the person was on their way back so I waited outside so I wouldn't miss them for another 20 min. After still nothing I called back and was told "well we tried calling you and since you didn't answer she went to make other deliveries. You should have picked up the phone" and when I told him my phone never rang he told me it was not his problem. When I said "so basically I'm getting cold pizza then?" And he said unequivocally "yes."

Will NEVER order from here again.</review><user_id>102303530222479013016<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Decided I couldn't call it in, went inside ordered a triple pepperoni since I feel they skimp on toppings. They gave me one with normal pepperoni and the owners excuse was he didn't charge me extra. Sell me what I ordered!
Called in an order of wings. Gave them my name and number. Show up and pay. Ask if it's ready and they said they were giving it to the lady that only called in a pizza. "Do you want us put more in for you?"</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I just Ordered two large pizzas, they told me 10 mins wait, in about 5 mins they tell me my order is ready which was #984. Ofcourse the box feels warm it was sitting on top of the oven when i get home (i live about 2-3 mins away) the pizza was cold and the bread was hard. I know that pizza had to have been sitting there for quite some time. Then I realize both boxes were labeled order #962. That’s 22 orders before mine! I called to let them know so they don’t do it again but I wasn’t gonna go back swapping pizzas, they should have got em right the first time😒<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

pizza is amazing first of all but be warn if u don’t tell them u want the $5 pepperoni pizza they will charge you their original price for a 14”large with cheese only $9 instead of being $5 their price inside does not match what shows outside the window, they almost charged me double but I decided to wait to get a different cashier and ask for a $5 pizza with somebody else, since I thought the first cashier would have automatically offered me the $5 pizza instead he was willing to charge me twice.👎🏽< /Text>

Worst place to get pizza. Called 2 hours ago for a large and a medium pizza and we are literally still waiting for it to be delivered. Called several times and the manager was of no help. Just kept saying the driver is on his way. Still waiting.</Text>

Waited over 75 minutes for my pizza, finally called and they said they didn't process the order, and it would be an additional 20-30 minutes. Will never order again< /review>

(Translated by Google) I bought two pizzas, one they sent me in a good presentation, the other I don't know if they shut up and so they sent me terrible service and poor quality

This place has the best shrimp burritos! I've had them 3 times now (excessive, I know but worth every calorie) and they are perfect every time! They are cheesy, just perfect amount of everything, except this last time it was usually skimpy on the shrimp. My boyfriend has tried the nacho fries and nachos and has felt disappointment both times,  the cheese doesn't melt, his nacho fries didn't have much al pastor and the cheese wasn't melted on either. They have great tacos, too. Their red salsa is on point! Flavorful and spicy! While my boyfriend is not the greatest fan (he's pickier than I), I love this place, good food, great service, always fast.</text>

I had a al pastor super burrito...    It was pretty ordinary.   I rate it ok, not great.

I wanted to get tacos, but the only three outside tables were full, and I didn't want to eat tacos in my truck<//Text>

<text>Did not know this place existing, but tried it because someone recommended it. I found the tacos Al pastor to be real good. They are made in the traditional spit-grill. The tacos are also very affordable. I believe I only paid $1.25 a taco. I would recommend you all to give this place a try.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Came here about 2 years ago. Now I don’t know if they changed their name or owner, but it was called R Mexican Food. I got a Cubana Torta and it was really good. However I was not expecting ham but I just took it out and ate it on its own. Probably will come back.< /Review>

Homemade tortillas? Yes please. Their chicken is in a chipotle sauce- not too spicy but so delicious. The pastor was really good, and the asada was tender.  I can’t wait to go back.</review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Delivered by Uber eats. Food was good. Meat did have lots of oil like other places. Their red sauce is spicy. And their tacos actually have some cilantro on them 👌🏼
Order tacos through Uber eats. The tacos did not have as much oil as other places. If it comes out red, it's good, very spicy 👌🏼😋

<text>Going to Vonne's Salon is a wonderful experience.   Anna and her team are very attentive, professional and provide a relaxing atmosphere.  The entire team takes pride in their work.   My family loves being pampered here, which includes my husband for his monthly pedicure!  You will be pleased with Anna and her excellent team. They want to make you happy and satisfied. Treat yourself. You deserve it.<//text>< pics>

First time going here. I showed hair dresser Annie a picture of a textured a-line bob that I wanted. I went in with hair past my elbows and Annie using only the picture I provided was able to do exactly what I wanted. She made my hair cut BETTER than the picture and I could not be happier. I will be coming back for all my hair needs now that I know they are awesome!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Thank you Annie!< /Text>

I was really excited to try this place out because I saw they had some good reviews but I guess I won’t be one of them :( Got my nails done, gel set for $55 & not even two day’s later, my thumb nail broke in half and went to get it redone. Next day, two nails pop off and I don’t do anything major with my hands for them to just fall off so easily. The nail shape wasn’t the best either & my nails are just lumpy.. really wish I could say I would be a returning customer but I personally wouldn’t recommend this place to get your nails done. Sorry not sorry.<//Text>

I love this place!  Linda is the best hair stylist I’ve ever had. She’s the only one who cuts my hair!  Tony cuts my husband’s hair and always does a great job.  I also get manicures and pedicures here (Any has a loyal following.) Everyone is very professional and friendly. Excellent prices and superb service.<//Text>

Love this place.  Been going for many years with the family.  Tony is amazing he cuts extremely well, he cuts my guy's flat tops and they always look on point. Linda is also so amazing very sweet and takes her time doing eye brows well worth it also she cuts great haircuts n dye. They know our names and always make us feel special when we go there.  I would highly recommend them.< /Review>

Im so glad all the other salons in the area have horrible customer service because I would've never found this place! Tony cut my hair and its by far the best haircut I've ever had. The cut and customer service are unbeatable. I never rate places but i feel like this place deserves recognition. They're great. I highly recommend going to tony for any hair needs!<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I take the whole family here everytime to get taken care of. With a family of 5 we have to budget and their prices are super affordable. My husband has been going there to see Tony for almost 15yrs now for his cut. Myself and our 2 younger kids have been going in for the last 7yrs to Tony. He's excellent and always consistent and when we are looking for something new he always has great ideas. We've never been disappointed. My daughter and I love to get our manicures and pedicures here.  When my mom comes and visits a couple times a year from down south the first thing out of her mouth is "Let's go to Vonnies!" We love them there!<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXhtcBZ5JbnJ7_hDESnFrx5baTyJiEu845fcyj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

Great place! I've been getting haircuts here every time for as long as I can remember and came out satisfied every single time. If I wanted some special hairstyle, they would let me look at some catalogs and were always very patient if I didn't make myself clear about what I want in the beginning. Very cheap price as well. Regardless of the hairstyle and effort, only $10. Definitely recommend it!<//Text>

<review>Linda is very nice, they do have great people working there BUT do not get your hair cut there!!! I spent $93 on a choppy hair cut with a TERRIBLE highlight job! My daughter got a simple straight across trim THAT WAS UNEVEN! Again, very nice people but their work is awful!!!</review>< Response>

< Review>
Has everything you would hope to find in regards to it being a liquor store, and also has some things available that you wouldn't expect, like extension cords and cigars that are actually a good selection for a local liquor spot. Also has some things like BANG energy drinks for a great buy of 2 for $4. And if you enjoy some pistachios or peanuts with your favorite drinks they have some great little zip lock bags with some inside, so just stop by if your a local to silver lakes, it's well worth cutting out the drive outside of here to get very similarly priced things that are offered here without the drive.</Review>

<review>Panera in Beverly Hills is the same as Panera out in B.F.E. Oregon, and that's a good thing.  Need some food you are familiar with, something you know will sit well with you while walking around seeing the sites?  Hit up Panera.  The staff was friendly and the food was normal.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<Review>Food is great, but seating is limited given that the layout could have been much better utilized (-1 star) and you have to take a very slow elevator one flight up to a lone hallway enclosure just to access the restrooms (-1 star).<//Review></record>

<Review>I really like this location.  The staff is always friendly and the wild rice  ch&x soup is to die for!  I also like that you can get an apple for a side when you order lunch.  You know what they say...."An apple a day keeps the doctor away!".  Who came up with that anyway, lol.  Not sure if it's true, but the way I see it...it can't hurt and that's for sure.  Unless you are allergic to apples...then don't get one. :)</Review>< Name>

It's got a big dining room in the back and is support affordable for the area. It can be pretty cold, so I'd suggest bringing a jacket or sweater.</text>

Customer Service needs to a little more cheerful, late food delays needs to be more inviting and a better selection of desserts. Offer sample mini cups for specialty drinks.</Text>

I ordered ahead and my meal was not ready. Generally not a problem, but parking is crazy on the street so it's a real pain. When I got back to my office to eat, the bread was so burnt I could only eat the sandwich without bread, which is not a sandwich at all. I contacted corporate offices with a complaint and never heard back.<//review>

<review>I like to get the half mac n cheese, half green goddess cobb usually. It's so good! The breakfast sandwiches are also yummy! The drinks are yummy, too! Everything is yummy! Also, they have free WiFi, which I take advantage of to do work as well as to play pokemon go....</review><user_name>Kristi Yagi< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Terrible. Came here for breakfast with my girlfriend. Her food was handed to her instantly while my food was prepared. She was finished eating by the time my food was finally ready.

When I asked for a pastry to be heated, I was directed to a microwave which was on the floor.

Edit: last time I went back, they didn't have any soufflés and didn't plan to at all that day. What a lousy place to eat.<//Review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>COOLEST Panera Bread store I've ever experienced! I walked in and immediately fell in love with the space. It's got a warm industrial-modern feel with high ceilings, rustic wood tables and exposed brick walls. I'm so excited that we now have a store in Beverly Hills. The Hot Turkey Panini w/ a cup of Tomato soup is my all-time favorite. Today I tried the LENTIL QUINOA BOWL WITH CHICKEN and it was DELICIOUS. It had fresh kale and spinach, quinoa and lentils, antibiotic-free chicken, all in a flavorful soy-miso broth. You have to try it!!!

Overall: There is such a unique vibe in the store that I've never experienced at any other Panera. Plus, the food is incredible. There's free wifi, staff is attentive yet knows when to leave you alone. I see it as a great working space to go/hang out on the computer writing and relaxing.

Loved it. Proud to be the first to share this awesome cafe with everyone on Yelp. So glad I finally have a Panera in Beverly Hills, Beverly blvd is now complete!</text>< gmap_id>

Poor service. Had to literally ask someone if I could place my order (she was standing there not doing anything either). Then they changed my favorite salad (Asian Chicken) with an awful replacement. Why???<//Text>

<Review>My puppy is not social at all because of corona virus but he did such a good job with the staff and other puppies here. He got his wispy hair trimmed and he looks soo cute. Im so happy with the outcome. I wish his nails were rounded out but its OK.

<Name>Judi Gladish< /Name><Review>I took my dog in today at Bath N Biscuit and was so impressed! I moved a few years ago and it was too far to drive back to the groomer I always took my dogs. This business was referred to my daughter so I thought I would give it a  try. I have tried to bathe Daisy but I can’t do it and she was looking pretty raggedy, I think she was even embarrassed. I dropped her off not knowing what to expect. I was very, very surprised and happy at what she looked like, didn’t even look like my baby girl! The gentleman was extremely pleasant. I would recommend Bath N  is Biscuit to anyone that needs an excellent place to take their dogs for grooming. Along with a great job, it is very affordable!  Thank you for doing a beautiful job.< /Review><GmapID>0x80905694942e9f7d:0x63cc66f952a003<//GmapID>< Rating>

It was his first visit and reported on pick up that he went a little crazy.  My husband said why didn’t you just call and say you couldn’t groom him.  They said he was hollering.  He just needed a short answer dog shave and bath.  I feel horrible that my poor boy had to go through this.  He has bruises on both sides of his groin.<//Review>< pictures>

Our dogs love this place! They treat them like royalty and allow them to casually “visit” with other when they’re well behaved. Our precious elderly golden who needs to lie down for grooming and nail treatments is catered to with tender accommodating care. On the floor! Very high recommendation.< /review>

<text>This place is great. The grooming is top tier for a very reasonable price. Every time I go, the staff are very busy, so there is not much time for small talk. If you are looking to be pampered and told that your dog is amazing or wonderful, you’ll probably want to go spend $100+ somewhere else. They get quite a bit of business, so you’ll have to schedule a week in advance sometimes. Highly recommend.<//text>< Pics>

I took my poodle to get groomed in the morning and they took all day long to just bathe her. The employees hung up on me when I tried calling to get an update on my dog.They didn’t do the full service I paid for. The employees had me waiting outside for so long, just for them to do their job. They had the audacity to bring me the wrong dog and tried arguing with me saying it was my dog.<//review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>We have been taking our dog here for grooming for the past year.  Prior to that, one place to the next never getting good quality service without overpaying.  Today we brought our newest puppy to get her groomed too.  This place treats us so well, and makes the animals relaxed and not afraid of their shop like going to the vet.  We highly recommend this place for their professional grooming and spa treatment for your animal.  We even love the way our dogs come home all dolled up with bows in their ears.</Review>< userid>

I’ve taken my dog here on two occasions to get her nails trimmed. The first time she had one nail bleeding a bit and they told me to take care of it at home if she has any issues. Fine.

But I took her back again yesterday and they bring her out to me... with blood streaking underneath her as she walks. My puppy is happy to see me so she jumps onto my legs, staining my pants and also getting blood on my legs. I don’t mind mud or anything from my doggies, but their own blood? It made me sick to my stomach. They obviously didn’t know what they were doing.
I told them there was blood and they took her back and dumped her nails in a tub of some lotion looking creamy stuff. (Seems unsanitary to me but I don’t know what the stuff is).

They then give her back to me telling me to carry her so that the concrete doesn’t make her nails bleed more.

This would normally be fine but I had ankle surgery and I’m not supposed to carry much more than a few pounds... and my dog is NOT light. I had to carry her to the car then from the parking lot and up the stairs to my apartment. (In 100 degree weather).

On top of that, I counted 4 bloody nails. There could’ve been more but I didn’t count before they dunked her nails in that solution.
No excuses. If anything, go a little long than HURT my dog.

Never returning. I’ll take my business elsewhere or just do them at home from now on.</Text>

Took my dog here twice when they first opened. It was very dirty with pee puddles on the inside of the gates where they take the dogs. On one occasion my brother took his dog here and witnessed one of the workers kicking a dog underneath them. It made a lot of sense for as to why my dog absolutely dreads going here vs other groomer shops. I don’t  live too far but two blocks away and often walk my dog near here. My final time taking her here: She got overwhelmed as we approached the door and panicked her way out of her collar and ran away. To my surprise she ran home and waited for me just outside the door. That was my last straw with this place and i choose not to take my animals there anymore< /Review>

I just took my Fergie girl who is a 5lb yorkie/Maltese mix in to get groomed on 10/16/18. Brandy groomed her for the first time as I have had Maria and Babs groom her before. She did a fabulous job!!! Wrote down what I wanted, we talked it over, she took her time and she called me 20 min before my girl would be done! I’m all about customer service and they do just that! I love the environment as well and they are affordable!!! My mom recommended them to me and we’ve been going to bath and a biscuit ever since! Love the environment and they all know what they are doing! My Fergie girl is always a happy girl after a day at the spa! Also if you refer them to someone and they mention your name to your groomer you will get $5 bucks off your next appointment! They take care of you and you take care of them ❤️<//review>

It was my first time going to a groomer with my pet and I was really impressed. They have a spacious and clean atmosphere. I really like the bow they put on my girl when she was all trimed and smelling good. This is defiantly my spot now whenever my pomchi needs grooming.<//Review>

This place takes WAY to long! What is the point in having a 8am if your dogs aren’t ready to be picked up until 4pm? We were told they are only human and it depends on the day! Well this is my dogs 4th trip and it’s been the same all 4 times!< /text>

So unfriendly today!!  Makes us wonder how are they treating our dog? Same unfriendliness ? Not one groomer spoke to us. Katrina is our groomer, love the look of our  Shih Tzu when we pick him up but the unfriendly attitudes makes us want to go somewhere else.......</text>

Can't believe this place isn't open on the weekend! Most people don't have time during the week. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I know. Businesses like this do a disservice to the community.< /Review>

Had to have my car towed after popping a tire yesterday and I am so glad I happened to call mission valley towing. They were so helpful and even gave me advice on good local places for oil changes ect. Hopefully I won’t be needing my car towed anytime soon but if I did I would definitely call them again!< /review>

Locked keys in my truck per usual. I had called around at a few towing companies for service and many were charging 85-90 dollars! Came across Mission Valley towing and spoke to Floyd. He’s had the best rate of anybody that I had called and was very kind and easy to talk to over the phone.

In a timely manner, he was able to come out to where my truck was, and was able to very quickly get my keys! The whole experience was easy and Floyd was very personable. He offered me several solutions as to accessories I could very easily buy for my truck in case Of future lockouts! I often lock the keys in my truck several times a year!

If you need towing service, call Floyd! He’ll be very prompt and will kindly offer his services to get you out of any towing pickle that you might find yourself in.</Review>

I called Mission Valley Towing after not being able to get a hold of 2 other companies. They were kind and able to pick me and my car up within 25 minutes of the call. They were also flexible with the location and had great customer service. I absolutely would recommend their services to anyone in need of a tow.</Review>

This man has helped me tow my vehicles 3 times this year, without fail. Communication skills on point, always answers the phone, always on time. Takes his time with loading the vehicles, does accurate recon before loading and safety is his number 1 priority. Punctual, very good prices, and always willing to go out of his way to help you out. Not only does he run a good honest business here in San Diego, he truly serves the community every day. I highly advise to use his services if you’re ever in need of a tow, a lot of places might do the same thing but this guy definitely cares about you the customer, and it shows in his work.</text>

Floyd is the man! He was super helpful and on time. He even correctly diagnosed what's wrong with my truck (fuel pump). I had my truck towed to a larger known repair shop and suggested that I go somewhere else. He was genuinely concerned that I was going to be overcharged for the repairs. Which, I was.<//review>

My husband's company truck was broken into and the ignition lock was destroyed. It needed to be towed. Floyd was quick to answer and was to our place of business quickly after providing pictures and giving him the information. He was able to provide a quote and get our truck to the shop relatively painlessly despite being parked in a difficult position on a busy road in San Diego.< /text>

I called mission valley towing after another tow company was giving me the run around. They took my info and gave me a quote for the tow. The tow man showed up within the time that I was told. He was very nice. He did a good job at picking up my car and towing it to my house in a very timely manner.<//review>

<Review>These guys delivered OUTSTANDING service! I spent a majority of my morning calling around trying to get a quote only to run into automated machines and being told that I’d have to schedule appointments. I gave Mission Towing a call and received a quote swiftly. The truck arrived less than 30 minutes after the initial call, got my car onto the bed in about 10 minutes and was on its way to the auto body shop. Also, the pricing was extremely reasonable with no extra fees or surcharges. I can truly say that I am thoroughly satisfied with their service and I would highly recommend if you’re ever in need of a tow!< /Review>< Pictures>

Unbelievably the battery in my Nissan 350Z went flat again while we were away on a 7 day vacation.I called Mission Valley Towing straight away and spoke to Floyd who I booked to come out early the next morning. Floyd jump started the Z and even waited around to make sure it was charging up.This is the 2nd time in about 12 months I have used Mission Valley Towing and they were fantastic both times.Floyd keeps the prices low and the service high.What more can I say?< /text>

People need to shop around before choosing this guy. I was in San Diego visiting my family and had rough time with my car. I called him up and he charges too much just to go a couple of miles. Not friendly either, if you're having a bad day then don't take it out on your customers.< /text>

Where do I start ? My in laws have used this place many times over the past 20 years. I remember an accident mission valley towing went to 10 years ago. Everyone was fine and floyd recommended this place to get the car fixed. Ive used this place at least three times. The insurance company has paid me back. Always on time and never a problem. Floyd is very kind and considerate to everyone. Thank you thank you.< /text>

I called Mission Valley Towing because they were the highest rated on Google in my area. I was happy to find out the reviews were correct. I had my car towed about 15 miles at rush hour, but he was still kind enough to knock some money off his originally quoted price. He doesn't act like this job is a chore, as this is his own business. He is efficient, kind and was generous enough to let me ride with him to my destination (mechanic). He took are of my car and me. I felt very lucky to find him and would highly recommend calling!< /text>

Mission Valley Towing has been great. Our car was towed from a busy freeway in Orange County to a recommended repair shop for repairs in San Diego. All was done well. I have relied on Mission Valley Towing for my towing needs for several years.. I've had jump starts, battery replacements, towed my car from Old Town to Kearny Mesa Toyota, and another time from my house to a shop recommended. I've found Mission Valley Towing to be reliable, on time, fair priced and competent. I heartily recommend Mission Valley Towing.

Want to add that Floyd with Mission Valley Towing just towed our camry again to Darby's body shop in normal heights. Will report later with Darby's how the job turns out. So far I'm happy with the fast and complete service we've received with Mission Valley Towing. Thank You.<//review>

<text>Horrible! Located less than a mile away from this place and needed a tow to an auto shop because my car wouldn't start and they refused to come out without an explanation other than "I won't be able to make it out to you." I asked if it was something where I needed to wait and he referred me to Western towing which is way farther from where I am located from. I asked to speak to a manager and he said that he was one. I let him know that that was unfortunate and hung up. Not sure where the 5 stars came from for this place but I am disgusted and now stuck stranded in this complex. I will be calling this place tomorrow and requesting to speak to the real manager.</text><Gmap_id>0x80dbfe2aa2bc6111:0xa274d7a7396d7fed</Gmap_id>< response>

Getting a hold of the social worker is the most annoying thing I had to do since I applied. They don’t call when the time of appointments, do they even know how to do their job I guess not?! She makes me wait so long for one question, it’s not even that hard. I hope you guys learn to manage your time wisely so that other people like myself don’t have to go through this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

<userid>103929235563174354451</userid><review>If there is a negative rating, that is all these people deserve. Getting ahold of anyone on the phone is dam near impossible, let alone reaching someone who actually knows what they are doing. I've filed my provider and recipient form multiple times and each and every time there has been some sort of complication or they've simply lost the form somehow. No two people from this office can give you the same answer. Management needs to reevaluate everyone who works there because no one seems to ever know anything about anything.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>I called the social worker, Michael Petty, who was on my mom's case with a concern about the care giver Loretta. This care giver got in my face when I had concerns  about my mom's care and said "Your not going to fire me"  and looked at  my mom. My mom just looked down. Four years ago, my mom was at my house celebrating my daughter's graduation. Three years under Lorretta, the care giver, my mom declined. My mom's condition got worse. This women  showed up for the money,  was not that caring, didn't do much  and should not be taking care of other people. When I called Michael Petty, the case worker, to make a complaint, he said "How do I  know your not crazy?" He did not take me seriously. He blew me off. Unprofessional. That was his job to take complaints seriously. My mom landed in a hospital for malnutrition.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

When payment falls on holiday, you need to wait for another 2-3days after. Please improve your system and in case like that, even holidays,  payment should be kicking in your account.</Text>

IHSS said nothing about how and or when new providers will receive a provider number. It's now 4 MONTHS after the receiver has been approved, yet they've sent her NO INFORMATION pertaining to timesheets. They do not answer the phone. IHSS Sacramento refuses to give their fax number - so forms must be submitted via snail mail. They make sure to focus the training on, you-will-go-to-jail-if-you-commit-fraud, but no time on what duties we can perform, when and how we can fill out timesheets, or even where to go to fill out timesheets online. On top of it they state it takes 4-6 WEEKS just to enter someone in the "system" and it takes at least 6 weeks to receive a paycheck once they've fully processed ones paperwork, which would be ILLEGAL FOR ANY COMPANY IN CA to do to people. The director and people who drag their feet while working there should be ashamed of themselves.</Text>

<review>I would be lost without this program. My numbers of workers (since 2004) have been compassionate , informative and able to point me in the right way especially in time of extreme need. They DO what they say they will DO in a VASTLY overworked and underpaid caseload. I personally at my top dont know if I could do it - takes a special kind of gal....but if you are patient and go thru the processes to GET ELIGIBLE it is sooooo worth it.< /review>< pictures>

<text>I HSS failed my mother! Adult protective service in Sacramento failed my mother and our family. I called and begged them to help us! I told them that Joanne Levitt was taking advantage of our mother Gloria Stanhope, that she was telling our mom that she didn't have Dementia and that she was taking money from her! Then that Joan (pronounced Joanne) daughter Nikki Leavitt was signed up to be her car provider through IHSS and we were afraid for our mom! They did nothing! iHSS did nothing! I called Med-I-cal fraud and my mother died 3-22-17 because she wasn't being given her medication and Nikki didn't call 911 she called her mom! Then when EMTS came and asked for relative information they gave them my 90 year old aunt first and my cousin told them to call us! We would have our mother alive if APS would have done their job! If IHSS caseworker would have done their job my mother would be alive. All of a sudden Joan Leavitt said my mom made a new hand written will that left her most of what is in the house. My mother was blind! She couldn't write anything that was legible and she had a legal will done by a lawyer. If she signed anything she didn't know what she was signing because she had Alzheimer's! IHSS doesn't care about the people only saving a buck for California. I am heartbroken!< /text><gmapID>0x809ac34cbb72a00f:0x4fed4ea147924edd< /gmapID>< date>

This RAVE review isn’t so much about the food as it is the service. Don’t get me wrong the pizza is good also. However, over the phone - in person - register - delivery driver. Every one of them provides excellent service. It all starts at the top so if I didn’t know any better I would say management is on point and treating the customers and their team just like their supposed to. Keep up the great work because the team is the reason we have their number memorized!< /text>

If I could give this place a 10 star, I would ! All quality ingredients, and they will make a pizza exactly the way you want it. I've been going there (Fairfield store) since 98' and its been my long time favorite :) In my personal opinion, its the best value for pizza in Solano County. Also, if ever you have an experience, or food that isn't 5 star, the owner Mario, will always make it right, whatever it takes. This place really respects their customers.< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>My favorite pizza place in town.  They have been here for over 20 years serving pizza to the residents of Fairfield and you don't stay open for over 20 years unless you're doing good business.  Only downside is they get very busy on Fridays/weekend's you may find yourself waiting 1.5 hours for delivery.
I highly recommend their "Fred Bread" parmesan bread sticks, they are buttery and delicious!  Sometimes i go just for the Fred Bread only.  They also have "Tony Ts Bread" which is their bread sticks with cheese and pepperoni.  Yum yum!< /text>< pictures>

Ordered delivery with these guys.  Their delivery driver was super personable.  We ordered a large pizza and they accidentally made a medium.  They realized the mistake before even bringing us the pizza and just brought us both pizza's.  Awesome customer service!  Will continue to order pizza through these guys for many years to come!<//Text>

Cenario's is THE pizza restaurant for my family. My wife loves the homemade sauce. Our kids love the Fred Bread. All the ingredients are outstanding! The staff are all very courteous, professional, and customer oriented. Alexandria is the manager and I think of her like a head chef in a Gordon Ramsey restaurant! She has high energy and is great with the patrons. It's obvious that she puts huge importance on how her ship is run. It always makes me feel good when she acknowledges my military service and thanks me. Awesome!!<//text>

Had A small incident with a gentleman over the phone. I reached out and emailed the owners with my problem and they got back to me right away and handled the situation. I truly appreciate it because most companies don’t take complaints seriously. This shows that not only do they care about the business reputation but Longtime customers. Hands down best pizza EVER!! My family and I have been ordering over 10+ years you will not be disappointed.</Text>

Best pizza I've ever tasted. I'm a pizza fan, been my favorite since I was 7. Let me tell you, I moved here from the city, the pizza here is so good that if I moved back to the city I'd honestly drive out here just for the pizza. It's all I eat now. Oh and customer service is just as great, they make you feel like family so to have great food and amazing service, you can't go wrong!!!!<//Text>

<time>1492823098435< /time><rating>5< /rating><Review>The pizza has always been on peek. I order from here every time we have a party. Our guests love it. The wings are best when ordered crispy. But, the delivery time is awesome! Just ordered two Lg pizzas and it arrived within 25 minutes..it is a Friday night. During busier hours, the delivery time might take 40 minutes even though the estimated time says like 70-75 minutes. The price is absolutely worth it. I wish they had more coupons for ordering online, they only have two to choose from, so that is the only downfall.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Great place. Always clean. Lunch specials are inexpensive and come with a choice of bread or a salad and soda.Pepperoni is our favorite.</review>

Would have given 5 stars but twice now they put sun dried tomatoes instead of roasted red peppers..first time didn't find out until we got the pizza home, this time we looked before coming home. I suggest you make sure your pizza makers know the difference between tomatoes and bell peppers!< /Text>

<Text>Decent Pizza.  Called in for delivery because my normal pizza joint is not open for business today.  The service was a bit slow.  I ordered 2 large pizza, some wings and drinks.  It took them about 1 hour to get everything ready.  We were starving.  Other than that, the pizza taste good.  The wings not so much.  We ordered the crispy chicken wings, and my coworker said they are very fatty.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>No decent indoor seating. This place is more for take out. The cenario's in Cordelia is vastly better with a ton of indoor seating and the interior is much cleaner overall. Decent pizza. But I feel the quality in Cordelia is better.< /Review>< Pictures>

Omg where do I start! I came in today at Round 7:45-8ish and was greeted by brandon, matt, then sam. Bernatta took my order and let me just say AMAZING! I was still in uniform complaining about my bad day at work, not thinking this young lady is still on the clock, cenarios was busy at this time but she still maintained to listen and take my order  promptly! AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! We had a brief discussion about how ginger ale makes a bad day better, and bernatta gave me her own bottle of ginger ale she had purchased for herself. She went above and beyond to  ale me feel special. Now I'm not saying you'll get a free bottle of ginger ale from her lol my point is she CARED. The whole entire crew CARED and was extremely  friendly!! Thank you for a memorable night. Thank you for making my day 100% better!<//Text>

The Manager say that he didn't believe that it was possible since he "checked" the food before it left and hung up in my face. The only person that was concerned and very apologetic was our delivery driver.< /Text>

I've visited 3 times in the last 2 year's. Everytime they exaggerated there delivery time AND ready time. I was there last night and a call came in and the Manager lied to to the caller. I know because he did it to me... I called him on it it and he blew me off and smirk his face like whatever...

< Review>
First time trying pizza here so I played it safe and got a pepperoni with breadsticks. I was not impressed by the size of the large and how I felt I could have gotten a little ceasers for $5 but after taking my first nite I could taste the fresh mozerilla. The bread sticks were super yummy. I am pretty happy with my order and will order again some day.</Review>

< Review>
First and for most SHOUT OUT TO SALMA!! She is the best!
My registration was suspended from the DMV since I forgot to insure one of the cars I had that was just sitting due to covid! I had to act quick since I would be starting work in a a couple of days. So I searched up acouple of places and came across this place! I walked and and they were helping other people but was still greeted quickly and was told they would be with me soon. To my surprise that was pretty quick! Salma was the person that greeted and helped me out! I had acouple record and points on my driving history and she still assured me that it would be okay! (Sometimes it’s embarrassing to get insurance since my record isn’t so great since I was a dumb kid with a license back then) but she made me feel comfortable and assured me it’s only human to make mistakes! It was quick and easy and she was really professional yet made me felt comfortable to get auto insurance! No joke! I felt compelled to write a review. She even helped me with my registration suspension fee process since it was my first time dealing with all this!
Thank you all you guys at auto fiesta! And who knows maybe I WILL do my taxes with you guys! Lol
So if you had a bad record or speeding tickets and duis. Don’t hesitate to check them out! They are nice and won’t make you feel uncomfortable or make you into a bad person ! They just want to help . That’s the feeling I got !<//Review>

Very helpful staff! They were able to inform me about the different coverages and prices they provide for car insurance. I recommend you to come here for your insurance needs, especially if you dont know much about insurance. Thanks Viviana!< /Text>

Brought in a letter I got in the mail clearly stating to bring in my documents so my account could be fixed (had all my paperwork) and still couldn't get help. Instead I was told to come back in a hour when the manager gets back. Employees not properly trained to help customers, very bad customer service, the letter stated in bold words what I needed to bring and still couldn't get help. Horrible.<//Text>

worst business ever. Called them to get an insurance quote for a commercial building. Had to call back 4 times and kept telling me to call back for 3 weeks , just to tell me they didnt accept new businesses.  What a waste of time. LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN !!!!< /review>

From the time we arrived Mark Hanson made us feel welcome and comfortable and never felt pressured. He was an absolute pleasure to work with!! Thank you Mark for helping us through the purchase and financing of our car. Everyone in the office was very professional from start to finish; very easy process. The manager Jackie was also very kind and made it a point to touch base with us twice while we were there.<//Review>

Omar is an AMAZING sales man. As a young person of color, I was treated with dignity and respect (as I should) from the whole MB team at this location. I appreciated that. Love my new 2021 C300.<//Text>

<Review>I  had my van in about 5-6 times over the last 2 years with wheel speed sensor issues on my sprinter and spoke to Sam Lafoca about it and he took care of it.  He had the service tech manager involved, they dug into it and found an electronic issue with another part of the system that was triggering faults With the wheel speed sensors so he ordered it and got it fixed within a couple days.  In the meantime I had really needed my van for that week and he was able to get another sprinter loaner for me to use and got me out of the pickle I was in.  Sam is truly one of those good guys that will do his best for you!<//Review>< Rating>

The packet of information with the Carfax, pictures, and video were really useful since I was purchasing the vehicle from out of state.  After the sale, he coordinated the shipping of the vehicle and promptly had it on it's way.  Overall it was a great experience, the vehicle I purchased was everything and more than I had expected.  Thanks Alex for a great experience!!!< /review>< Pics>

Customer Service is on point with this dealership.  The Bob Crabtree, Jackie Nasser & Javier exceeded my expectations. They really go out of their way to make purchasing a vehicle pleasant and not the typical “sales” process.
I am not a local in Temecula however I was referred by a friend and the drive was worth it.  I’ll be a Mercedes-Benz of Temecula customer for life.</Review>

Buying my wifes first Mercedes Benz was truly smooth and enjoyable experience. Rick Akigbe the salesman we were lucky enough to help us with the right choice. His knowledge of every car that my wife asked about was very impressive not to mention that Rick from our first greeting to saying goodbye driving off in my wifes 2021 A220 Mercedes Benz was amazing and we had started a new friendship.  Thank you Rick Akigbe and Mercedes Benz of Temecula. Dale and Kathy<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Never buy from this shady dealership. They lied on my application so I can get approved for a car. Sold me an over - priced Mercedes. Gave me a bad interest rate when I had a 773 credit score. The car broke down a month after having it. The provided me with a loaner until they fixed they 6 thousand dollar problem (a month after buying it). They lagged months on fixing the car. I ended up changing my number in the process. They couldn’t get ahold of me via phone (when they have my email). So they reported the car stolen. (Never once contacted me via email). And I ended up getting arrested. Then on top of that they want me to pay 3500 dollars extra for rental. This is my experience from only buying a car at the shady dealership. Go to another Benz dealership if you can. I would never do business with this dealership again. Worse mistake ever.< /review>< pics>

{'time': 1613762844702, 'text': 'Thank you for your message, but after an intensive search in our customer database, the name of "Anita Baker" did not show up or resonate with any of our service or sales personnel. However, after a little more investigation, it appears that you, Mr. Darryle A. found time to "craft" this far from the truth review. For clarification, you mentioned, "lagged months of fixing the car"  - this was due to our 5-star rated service department negotiating with the warranty company on your behalf. Outcome: Not only did we cover the repair in full and in goodwill, but we also provided you with two adequate loaner vehicles.\n\nThe $3,500 for the two loaner vehicles you refer to was accumulated due to damages (someone during your possession of this car removed our GPS tracker) and the nearly 10,000 miles you drove between Perris, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas in a time frame of almost 75-days! We have records to show our numerous accounts of getting in touch with you, and we were asking you to bring back the last loaner vehicle and that you please will pick up your repaired and ready-to-go car. After not hearing back from you for weeks and months, seeing our loaner car, luckily still trackable through Mercedes-Benz USA, driving the axis LA-Perris-LV multiple times throughout, we informed the authorities.\n\nSince you found time to write this review in your spare time, we\'d appreciate you stopping by and pay or send us the outstanding $3,500 before we would initiate further legal actions.\n\nMercedes-Benz of Temecula'}< /resp>

Took my Mercedes AMG in for its very first maintenance service. She completed the paperwork and then brought me to the service desk. Service desk asked me to have a seat and they would be with me in a few minutes. A few minutes needed up being more than fifteen minutes waiting for my loaner. A guy finally comes and starts the loaner process. He leaves for ten minutes and comes back to get me. He walks me up to a NISSAN for a loaner car. This is what Mercedes Benz of Temecula gives to their AMG customers?! Nissans? Not up to par with other Mercedes dealerships at all. The guy walks me back to the service desk to make sure there are no Mercedes loaners available. They say no. No apologies, no nothing. The same lady and man behind the service desk were also complaining about how customers always call to say they forgot something after they drop their car in for service. I would have expected Mercedes Benz to be have more professional employees behind their service desk. I was within an earshot of being able to hear everything they say while waiting forever for the loaner car. I had texted my Service Advisor Emily regarding changing out my loaner car when a Mercedes becomes available. She never responded, and when I picked up my vehicle after service she ignored me like she didn’t see me. No hi I’m sorry I couldn’t respond to your text..nothing. Real unprofessional. Not happy for my first experience with their service Dept at all. Don’t put your AMG owners in Nissans for loaners.< /Text>

< Review>
The managers and sales team were Absolutely professional, ethical, honest, and I am so happy I purchased my Mercedes from Mercedes-Benz of Temecula.  I would not go anywhere else.  After going to Walters and Fletcher I won't step foot in those dealerships again. I highly recommend Mercedes-Benz of Temecula, they are amazing!  Thank you Mercedes-Benz of Temecula for your excellent customer service, professionalism, honesty, and care you give your customers.< /Review>

<text>I picked up my Sprinter this past week.  I interacted with five dealerships over the summer before deciding on Temecula MB, and not one of those other dealers compared with Lauren Rose's responsiveness, knowledge of the Sprinter, or ease in building a personal connection. Nolan responded immediately after I submitted an inquiry and provided several build sheets with options I was considering.  When I visited the dealer to meet Lauren and look at different options I was considering, she had pulled up three vans to the side of the building to illustrate the differences and walked me through each one of them.  All of that said, I was not the least bit surprised when I showed up this past week and found the picking-up process to be low key, professional, and even light hearted.  It was an enjoyable experience coming in to pick up my van and I was on my way back home with my van in a little over an hour.</text><userid>110409708656022751749</userid><date>1601650152710</date>< Name>

< Review>
This is our second vehicle from MB of Temecula this year (E350 in February) and came back specifically for the exceptional customer service we experienced from Cali Joe, Jackie and team. We were exploring all luxury car options but definitely felt like a valued customer of MB of Temecula when we reached out about replacing our SUV last week.  They were so welcoming and because of the amazing service, we drove off in our GLS a few days ago.  Best car purchasing experience we’ve ever had!<//Review>

Mark is truly an awesome sales man! We came in 2hours before closing and he took care of us and gave honest feedback. He even came in on his off day to get the job done. So happy we were able to work with him. Ari is also an awesome finance manager he took care of us! I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new ride. I can not forget to mention Huck he also provided outstanding service. All 3 of these guys are awesome and I recommend working with them. Love my new car and looking forward to upgrading in the future. Thank you guys!</review>

<Text>I am a long-time luxury car owner.  I was previously a customer of Fletcher Jones Motorcars.  I can say without hesitation that my experience at Mercedes-Benz of Temecula far surpassed any prior car-buying experience I have ever had.  From the dealer's owner, Garth Blumenthal, to his Internet Sales Manager, Bob Crabtree, to the Finance Department, I was meant to feel not like just another customer, but a member of their family.  There was zero nonsense.  When I asked for their best price I got it the first time I asked.  They cared about my priorities, they promptly responded to my questions and when it was time to deliver the car, they beyond delivered.  If you are in the market for a world-class automobile and a first-rate, honest and no "BS" car buying experience, you will not regret contacting Mercedes-Benz of Temecula.  I am now a proud, vocal member of their family and I have no doubt you will be, as well.<//Text>< pics>

I was referred to Q from my father whom spoke very highly of him so I had the opportunity to speak with Q prior to my appointment to let him know of certain specs I wanted in a car. Therefore, I didn’t spend a lot of time researching models but I knew I wanted a Benz. As soon as I arrived to the dealership, I was happily welcomed by Q and he already had some options that he wanted to show me. I found the exact color of the car I wanted and it happened to be the first model that my rep showed me. I test drove it, asked my rep a million questions about the specs in the car and I bought it. The transaction was smooth and I got a great deal! Q was not pushy and made car buying fun. It’s intimidating to commit to a car purchase but I appreciated the fact that my rep took the time to answer all my questions and never rushed me out.

<text>James Flood, the salesperson, was very courteous, easy going with no high pressure sales. He did everything possible to help us there and continues to assist us after the purchase.The sales and finance people were very pleasant and efficient.

The only time we run into a waiting period of 2-3 days is when our guests require a loaner vehicle. In your case, it appears that you requested a loaner vehicle which we, of course, scheduled for you and which had the time a waiting list of three days.\n\nRegarding the three days you mentioned, the time accumulated as follows: A cylinder head diagnosis requires a multiple-step process in running several diagnose programs over certain hours to point out the exact issue. When the problem was located, our technician then replaced the entire head. The repair was successfully done on the 25th, and your car was picked up a couple of days later.\n\nWe will discuss with our staff at Mercedes-Benz of Temecula the necessary steps to communicate time frames more clearly and set expectations into the correct time frame.\n\nThank you,\nYour Mercedes-Benz of Temecula Team'}<//resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Text>

First and foremost if you are looking for a Mercedes  I would definitely recommend you visit mercedes-Benz of Temecula, by far the best car lot experience I have ever had. The staff there are beyond excellent. Mark was an exceptional salesman definitely listen to every detail and request I had , Jacqueline by far the best floor manager she went above and beyond to help me get into my dream car , Huck the sales manager worked his magic never seen any sales manager work as hard as him,  and Wayne in finances was great very honest made signing my sale contract smooth and easy. I have absolutely no complaints from the time I walked In I felt very welcomed. I absolutely love my new car thank you so much to all the staff at mercedes-Benz of Temecula for helping me get into my dream car.< /text>

Good service and honest working stuff. i went there multi times and feel satisfied every time. recently my mercedes warranty was about to expire so i drop off my car there to fix some little problem and they fixed them all using the warranty and i end up paying small money for the wear parts which are not covered by warranty. I am satisfied and happy with their service and work quality. Bruce and Emily are both great service advisors.<//Review>

Cali Joe and his team were amazing! From the time we stepped on the lot, we were taken care of with the highest level of professionalism and customer service. We were there to purchase a car for my wife, and we ended up walking away with husband and wife C300's. Cali Joe, the Sales Manager Elan, and the whole staff including Joy, ensured we obtained the best deal that made sense for us financially. They were not pushy, and we were able to sit down and conversate about what we needed prior to leaving the dealership, and they made it happen. I will definitely refer my friends, family, and colleagues to Mercedes-Benz of Temecula, and they will definitely have to ask for Cali Joe!<//Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1614633519505, 'text': 'Good afternoon Mr. Georgiev,\n\nThank you for reaching out and bringing up your concerns to us. I am directly responsible of our inventory control and online pricing.\nOn Friday, when you were originally corresponding with our Sales Manager, Elan Yakovee about this possible discrepancy, he immediately contacted me to look into this. After researching diligently into our website, 3rd party providers and other possible platforms it could have been on we validated that there were no modifications to the original asking price of $58,888. This is and was the official asking price of the vehicle when it was posted online and made available at our dealership 6 days prior.\nAdditionally, we would never demand or force anyone to come into our dealership who is not comfortable. We offer a 100% online purchasing experience via Fast Pass on our website as an option for our guests who choose to shop from home.\n\nOur business model will always be people focused first. Should you have any additional questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out to me.\n\nCordially,\nAmir Alahwal\nGuest Relations Manager\namir@mbtemecula.com'}< /Resp><review>On February 27, 2021, I visited Mercedes Benz of Temecula with intent to purchase a 2020 BMW X5 (initially advertised at price $57,888 and upon my inquiry submission price increased to $58,888).
When I visited the dealership on February 27th, I was assisted by Frank Aftahi who apparently passed my contact info to Alex Aftahi who took over on February 28th the process of purchasing of my next vehicle.
At a point during the process I was unsure who I am working with since multiple people from the dealership were texting me with conflicting and confusing info about the vehicle.
During my interaction (by phone and by text), Alex Aftahi demonstrated zero credibility. He changed the price of the vehicle 3 times in one hour (from $57,500 to $59,888).
In my view, the dealership utilizes a ‘’fishing’’ strategy by advertising attractive prices and upon commitment by prospective buyer increases the price.
This may explain the fact that the dealership was unwilling to provide me with a written buyer’s order with price breakdown. They demanded me to personally visit the dealership which is in contrary with the COVID 19 remote purchase options that the dealership offers on its website.
I felt completely insulted as a prospective customer. This has been a very unpleasant experience and a total waste of my time.
I am really interested to know how the general management tolerates such a poor business conduct and unethical practices.

I would not recommend this dealership to anyone!

Sincerely,
V</review>< gmap_id>

< review>
Having problem with a simple battery replacement this dealership is unable to remedy.  They tell me they cannot get a hold of ANY battery because of COVID 19, that is not until JANUARY 20121. So when you choose to purchase a vehicle from this dealership, expect much talk but no solutions to what should otherwise be a simple fix.  There is no other choice for this particular battery like after market parts for all other cars. One is held hostage to their limited or non existent supply. And yet they tell me to search for a battery when they should offer a loaner car or offer to participate for a search for one of their exclusive parts like their batteries. This is all after the car was purchased from this dealership, shameful.</review>

I own a Metris van and currently have it for sale privately.....one buyer asked me for service records so i contacted this dealer where i have had my van in for service at least 3 times (i didn't purchase the van at this dealer).  I was told that Bruce would be the correct person to get my records for me.  I left a message, then 2 days later left another message, then talked to the same girl that i origanally talked with after 2 more days had passed and said i was not leaving another message.....she went back to the service dept and talked to Bruce, when she came back she said he knew what i needed and would email it to me.  Surprise surprise, it never happened!!!  I will be visiting the service dept soon in person but as of now i give them zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!< /text>

Most other dealers I’ve been to have inexperienced and immature people working for them with very little knowledge on how to communicate and explain their vehicles to the client.

Not only was this place immaculate, but the staff were as pleasant. I truly feel I was guided through all aspects of my purchase.

I wasn't sure what I wanted; I was quite inquisitive. During my time there, they never showed waivered attention nor a growing unrest in my questions. So I must say it was absolutely professional.

A hat-tip to Darcy Borges and the rest of the team for helping me with my time there.</review>< pictures>

<date>1607882052152<//date><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Mark was our guy! He provided the type of exceptional customer service that's most closely associated with what I would expect from MB! Now about my purchase experience;
The day I purchased my new car from MB Temecula, started off with the typical car dealership shenanigans. But NOT with MB Temecula, but with MB of Riverside. MB of Riverside in my opinion is not the place to go. The reason's I did not purchase from them include:
-unreasonably high interest rate
-poor customer service
-vehcile warranty issues, as it pertains to the purchase of a new car

When I walked into the dealership I was asked to wait for the gentleman I was supposed to meet, upon initial introductions he was very cady about passing me off to his colleague so he could continue his banter with the other employees. The next issue I had was after we put numbers on paper, they tried to lock me in with an absurd interest rate. I laughed and said theres no way a sane individual would agree to that. Within a couple minutes of talking with "finance", the interest rate had been adjusted. Lastly, the overall deal, as in the purchase contract, did not include the dealership extended warranty. This was taken out in an attempt to lower my monthly payment. One thing after another lead me to just simply walk out and never return, nor provide a recommendation to anyone else looking to purchase a MB. When I walked into MB Temecula, I was met with the exact person I was scheduled to meet with. The interest rate given to me was lower than the other dealership by nearly 2% and the purchase contract included everything! Not to mention, the car was perfect. If you are looking to spend your hard earned money on the purchase of a MB, I cannot stress enough the importance of going to Mercedes Benz of Temecula. Their customer service is top notch and unbeatable!!! And they have great amenities for their customers! Mark was our salesperson that took care of us!</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1608050967995, 'text': 'Hello Mathew Klopp,\nThank you for the five-star review!

Great customer service!  The dealership was clean and every employee practiced good hygiene and wore masks. My husband and I worked with Michael G, Elan and Javier who very courteous, genuine and personable. Michael and Elan worked out a great deal to get us into our new 2020 GLS 450. & Javier went above and beyond as well. Elan treated us to some MB merchandise before meeting with Javier in finance. Elan and Michael were patient and answered all questions that we had. Almost everyone who worked there congratulated us on our purchase, which was nice. We truly feel that we are apart of the MB Temecula family, looking forward to doing more business with MB Temecula.<//Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>I made an appointment for 11:40 on Saturday 5/16 for an oil change. I opted to not get a rental car and wait for my car to be serviced. It took THREE hours to get an oil change on my car. I was sent 3 surveys regarding my experience and expressed my displeasure in all three surveys about having an appointment and being forced to wait THREE hours for an oil change to be completed. .

Today 5/19 I got a phone call telling me that I didn’t wait 3 hours because they have time stamps on when cars are brought in an taken out. When I dropped my car off I was sent to the waiting area and my car wasn’t checked in for 20 minutes. When i got the text that my car was ready, I went to the counter to pay and then went outside to wait for my vehicle. I was then told that my car wasn’t ready and it would be another 15-20 minutes for it to be washed. That time is not included in their time stamps. Basically I got a phone call to tell me that I don’t know how to tell time and my time doesn’t matter. What a freaking waste.<//review>< Pictures>

I bought a certified pre-owned 2015 ML from this dealership in 2018. They had drenched the interior with their car perfume which wore off after a week or so. Once it wore off, the car had a musty/moldy odor that I couldn't get rid of. The dealership denied knowing anything about it. I ended up coming down with a severe case of pneumonia from June to September 2019. During which time, I received a letter from a Law Firm handling a class action lawsuit against Mercedes-Benz for defective vehicles with HVAC systems containing mold, spores, and fungus. I called the sales kid, Jordan Furlow at the dealership to say I wanted out of the vehicle as it had the mold problem and had made me deathly ill with pneumonia. Instead of adhering to consumer protection laws and buying the car back, they rolled around 30k into a new vehicle. I called Mercedes-Benz Financial for pay off information, and learned of what the dealership had done to me. I then called the dealership and spoke to both Jordan and the GM, Chris. Instead of owning up to the fraud that was committed, he told me my only option was to roll that debt from the defective ML again, for a second time, into a cheaper vehicle.

Stay away from this dealership! They will screw you over. I'm now filing a lawsuit against them.< /Text>

Michael Georgie was very professional from the time we entered the showroom. He took the time to explain every detail even though it was late. We arrived at the store at 645 thinking the closed at 8pm. They actually closed at 7, but Michael never made us feel rushed . He insisted on showing me all of the functions of my new car, we left the dealership after 11pm.

Thank you Michael for your excellent service and, my special gift and the follow up call to see if I had questions.

Willie and Georgia</review>

This was my first visit to this location. The customer service was superb. Ron at the loaner vehicle counter was genuine, friendly, and helpful with a smile on his face the entire time. Jose was my service advisor, he was patient and answered all of my questions without being condescending or making me feel like I was bothering him. I never felt rushed or overlooked. Everyone else I encountered was friendly and helpful as well. When they told me they had to keep my vehicle for service overnight, they had already found a loaner vehicle for me to utilize. Communication was thorough and quick. I hope this location is able to maintain this level of customer service, it was a refreshing change and I would definitely return for future service needs.</text>

Brought my GLE 350 in for the cup holder heat/cooling issue. They fixed that and I noticed a scratch on my car that wasn't there before. No questions asked they had it painted and detailed. Looks better than it did before I brought it to them. 5 Stars. For service.< /Review>

I went from considering 5 different brands to two as soon as we began discussing Mercedes. It's obvious he is as passionate and knowledgeable about the brand as he is customer service. After discussing things further and meeting a couple more times, I knew that working with him and Mercedes-Benz Temecula was the only way forward. During the purchasing process, everyone we interacted with was great and continued to leave us with a great impression. I'm glad we worked out a great deal on my new car and we're customers for life now. Thank you Gene!< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Andre the internet sales manager came thru big time.  I was in the market for a G63 and almost lost all hope I would get the combo I wanted.  Andre found me the car and also gave me a great deal.  I recommend him to anyone, he is a super nice guy and easy to deal with.  The customer service at this dealer is top notch!  They make you feel good about shopping there and they make sure your not just another customer to push out with a car.  Thanks guys see you next time!<//Review></record>

I didn't know it was popped into my bumper, I thought another dealership had removed it and just forgotten to replace it. So I came in and they made me buy a new light before they even looked at my car. After I buy the (non-refundable)  light they tell me that my light was still in my bumper. Something wasn't right, so I took it to a different dealership and turns out my light still worked so they just put it back and it worked fine. Now I have a $265.00 light I can't use or get my money back for. Go to the dealership in Laguna.</text>< Pictures>

<Text>Mercedes Benz of Temecula absolutely does over look deals if they can’t pound you (take you to the cleaners financially) and use their own financing.  They have a female sales women/ manager that will steal car deals out from under you if it benefits her and puts an extra $20 in her pocket.....so whatever you do... beware of the Mercedes dealership expectation you may have of being treated as a valued customer.  If they can make an extra $100 on a deal I am proof that they will take advantage of that opportunity!!!

<review>I recently bought a used Mercedes Benz for my wife and saw that some recalls were available.  I called and was connected with Emily Windbigler.  She did and amazing job setting the appointment as well as following up to confirm our appointment time.  My experience was pretty amazing with the staff at Temecula.  With Covid-19 as apart of our reality, they all were maintaining a great place of business with a clean environment, sanitizer available, and masks.  There was plenty of room and pockets of space for proper social distancing.  The customer service was excellent as they went above and beyond to create a memorable experience.  I have owned a Mercedes in the early 2000’s and my experience wasn’t the same, it was in a different city.  Check out Mercedes Benz of Temecula for a complete experience.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Amazing luxury service with a human warmth approach.  I went to a few dealership looking for a new vehicle and MB of Temecula was the only place I was treated with respect and honesty. I hands down recommend this place and have made it my new home for vehicle purchases from now on. I was made to feel like family.

My sales consultant, Omar Sahar, was warm, inviting, and non obtrusive from the start. He turned out to be not only an honest and informative salesman, but a kind human being in the best sense.

As I waited for Javier Suguimizu in the finance department, the GENERAL MANAGER Chris Lanza.came and sat with me and we had a great conversation. I have never been to a dealership where someone took the time to care for me on my personal life/interests.

Javier in the Finance department was also superb and made the process painless, and he was a joy to interact with.

I briefly had the opportunity to interact with the sales manager, Elon Yakovee. Again, another person who cared and interacted with me with attention and real interest.

Mercedes Benz of Temecula is top notch and I couldn't give it higher praise.

Everyone at MB, a HUGE thank you and utmost respect!

You need to open up the car wash service.  Stop using the covid as an excuse.  There is plenty of room in the waiting  area and you could still implement a booking system to limit the  numbers waiting.  Pretty bad when all other car washes are open.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I am so amazed by this place. I was contacted with so many MB stores around San Diego and LA areas to find right Sprinter for right price. I have a lots of experience in buying/leasing cars, over 20 cars in the last 16 yrs.  Lauren Rose is the one who helped me to get exactly what I wanted and even better than I wanted. She is also works so fast. She finalized deal faster than my van got washed and cleaned up. I would highly recommend Lauren as a sales/leasing specialist in your MB needs especially if you want to buy Sprinter van. Their inventory is huge. You can find there what you need, but if for some reason she wont have what you are looking for, just give her few hours and she will get you exactly what you want. Thank you Lauren. I appreciate for your help and experience I got at your dealership.< /Text>< pictures>

The sales experience at Temecula Mercedes was the most pleasant I have ever experienced at a car dealership. My transaction was handled completely by internet and phone conversation. From the very start of my purchase my sales person Robert Crabtree was fantastic!!  He was no pressure and a joy to deal with. He took videos of my car and sent them me and he handled the entire transaction with professionalism and class. My car was delivered to me and all paperwork was completed in the comfort of my home.<//review>

<Review>Everyone at MB of Temecula has welcomed me into the family and has made me feel special. I am looking into partnership opportunities with MB. I love racing, enjoy German engineering and would love to assist in sharing the company’s message to the new generation of drivers. I am a US Marine and also a book writer. The amount of attention that the AMG GT has gotten aboard my military installation is second to none. I want to inspire other service members that it is possible to own a “piece of art on four wheels” regardless of their income. Thank you for allowing me to experience greatness. Please contact me for future opportunities with the brand. My email is nelsontroncoso.us@gmail.com. Cheers! Please extend my kind regards to Toto Wolff and the Petronas F1 Team.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

At the request of Service Dept, i am sharing them, MB of Temecula, on social media to let everyone know about our experience with them:  very professional, friendly, accommodating, fast and impressive.  Bonus:  they gave our baby a bath, and dressed the tires after service.  On top of it:  they do not recommend extra purchase of items we don't need, they really look after their patron's best interest at hand.  Extra note:  THEY ARE ALL WEARING THEIR MASKS PROPERLY, OBSERVES SOCIAL-DISTANCING, AND VERY COMMUNICATIVE ON-THE-CLOCK as to expectations, timeline, pricing, and open-ended closing whether there's anything else they can do for the customer.  EVERYONE is treated fairly, they work very hard to the client's satisfaction... and my personal closing statement:  They do not deserve to be scolded neither disrespected just because of someone's own personal biases.  THANK YOU, BRUCE AND THE ENTIRE TEAM IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO. ❤.

FYI:  Bruce is a Navy Veteran, and a special shoutout to Ron and Patrick in the loaner-vehicle dept.  The A220w you loaned us is awesome!</text>

My Car buying experience with California Joe and Jacqueline at Mercedes-Benz of Temecula was great! They were very attentive and made sure that all of my questions were answered & needs were met (without being pushy). While this is my third Mercedes; my buying experience this time around was by far the best. I dropped by to get my C300 coupe washed (for free!) and drove away in a new C300 cabriolet convertible. The process was very smooth and streamlined, I have recommended California Joe to my family and friends! Head on over to Mercedes of Temecula to get your new ride today - Ask for California Joe!

They gave the Mercedes experience, you would expect when you buy a luxury brand like that, it was worth my 45 minute drive. I will go back and buy a car from them again.

< Review>
I purchased my first ever Mercedes Benz in 2015. My excitement was beyond ecstatic. I bought a 2013 S550. During the time of ownership, I conducted the regular scheduled maintenance and had all minor repairs done through the dealership. Within 3 yrs of owning the car, my turbochargers kicked the can. This was with around 65-70K miles on the car. Unfortunately, due to my surprise the warranty bought with the car had expired in November with replacement cost roughly around 14K. Don’t get me wrong I know “this is a Mercedes Benz” so the parts will be costly. I was just surprised at how fast the this issue happened.....fast forward Jan 2019, I purchase another S550 this one is 2015. Please make note of the month***** now my car is stalling while driving, my check engine light just came on (it’s not the automatic shut off to save gas), and I can’t believe that I gave this dealership another chance to get it right. After review of the other customers(which I should have done prior) I saw one resounding coincidence: used cars are sold here that aren’t meeting expectations. We will see what happens from here I’ll keep you all posted. Taking the car in on Monday. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️</Review>

As soon as I walked into this dealership, my experience was amazing.  The staff were extremely helpful and made me feel comfortable.  I have to admit I felt a little apprehensive going in by myself but then immediately felt at home once I walked in.  I walked out with my very first Mercedes and I am so happy with my decision.</text>

Service is always well done however I always account for it to take double the amount of time estimated. At my last appointment my vehicle was not even looked at the first day I dropped it off. In the end it was fixed and completed, but the service department is very slow.<//review>

Absolutely the best experience and customer service I have ever witnessed and experienced. Not many places you go into and the owner of the dealership is walking around offering water and coffee and assistance along with his other consultants and associates and introducing themselves just to greet you. Gene was an amazing and awesome salesman and would recommend him. They don’t push you and they don’t screw you over. As long as you are reasonable with them and understand you are walking into a Mercedes dealership not trying to low ball them, they will make sure you walk out with the car you want. I will truly be using Gene every time I go back in there and oh yes I’m coming back to this dealership as long as they continue the amazing customer service. The Sales manager Jacqueline was also exceptional to work with. Truly amazed by this dealership and haven’t stopped talking so highly of them. They are the Chick Fli A of car dealerships.
Thank you Mercedes Benz of Temecula so much for being great people and taking care of their customers.< /Review>

<text>Leased an E300 15 months ago.  At the time, dealer had trouble locating the key and said they would mail it to me in San Diego.

After countless emails, phone calls, texts and visits, I gave up... last month I lost my only key and they told me if would cost $800+ to replace and code to the vehicle.  It hasn’t been operable  for a month.

I’m disappointed in the dealership, especially since I’ve sent 2 deals their way.  Alex the fleet manager has yet to honor his promise to provide a second key, and I refuse to spend $800 for something I was entitled to.

If anything changes, I’ll update this post to reflect that....

Update as of July 1st 2019:  Finally got the key to my car that I was promised, they took the vehicle and had it from Sunday night to Friday night, but they did honor their word.... after a over a year.  Car was returned with a full tank of fuel, and clean (it has been filthy due to sitting idle for a month, and main and aux batteries were dead, but charged upon return).

Thanks to Sam & Chris @ MB of Temecula for making it happen.</text>< Rating>

Sandra, the sevice manager handled my E320 cdi cooling system problem efficiently and professionally. She had my car washed and vacuumed looking like it was detailed. So far, the work done was worth it (military discount included, thanks!). I plan to take it back as soon as MB sort out my recall concern?!<//Review>

<Review>What a magical experience thanks to Lee Kenniston, Jacqueline Nasser and the rest of the team at Mercedes-Benz of Temecula. My mom and i got treated amazingly by everyone we dealt with and it was a completely stress free experience. We laughed and smiled so much that my cheeks hurt - who can say that about a dealership experience??? My mom and I, that's who. Highly highly highly recommend this dealership.<//Review>< pictures>

I absolutely love Mercedes-Benz Temecula! I made an appointment to see Alex Aftahi and he took care of me. Was up front and honest of what I needed and wanted and he made sure that I was taken care of. After Alex, Jackie, one of the managers found me a great deal that made me so very happy! Finally, James Flood ensured that while I waited,  he started all my paper work, transferred all my stuff from my old car to my new one and ensured that during this whole process, that I was comfortable.  Every one that worked there who saw me sitting asked if I was being helped,  or if I wanted coffee or water or anything else. I felt cared for not just by 1 employee but by the entire team. Thank you Mercedes-Benz of Temecula!</Text>

Attentive, logged my issues correctly and was very communicative throughout. Everything was resolved as required and warranty repairs were take care of.

The second time I came to the service.  I have never seen anything worse. The worst service I've ever had. I have Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 Cargo Extended. I warned the manager that I had an important meeting at one o'clock in the afternoon, asked for a rental car, so that I could return later.  The manager assured me that the car would be ready by the hour.  At two o'clock in the afternoon, the car was not yet ready. Managers name is Reza Nejad Mercedes-Benz of Temecula. As a result, I picked up the car at 2:15 and was late for my important event. As a result, I picked up the car at 2:15 and was late for my important event. While driving home, the warning light came on.  I sent a message to the manager, what is it?  He replied that I would have to visit them next week. I said that I had a job and I could not come.  He replied that you can go and so, they say, nothing will happen.  I doubt the competence of this specialist.
Also, I paid for the wheel rotation.  The wheels were reversed, and the tire pressure was not adjusted.  It turns out that I still had to pay to pump up the wheels properly? The car was not washed, I had to go to the dirty car wash. Washer fluid was not added. I asked a question, why wasn't the DEF refueled like in other Mercedes-Benz service centers?  The manager replied that this service was paid.  Even so, he had to offer it for payment.  I had to go to a gas station and top up DEF myself.
I think that this is the attitude towards me, because I am Russian and speak English badly. How can you trust your safety to such people?
I wrote this review to a campaign question if I liked their service.  I received no answer.  I think they only like good reviews.  I don't think I can recommend this service to anyone else.</text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Tried to have recall repairs done at this store. I was told they had the parts, not true. I was told it would take 2.5 hours to repair, not true. After I told them I needed the car back they said a driver was on the way to pick me up,  not true.

Stay away from this business.<//Review>< Pictures>

The vehicle did not have the Apple car play  technology that the salesman stated it has. When discovered the same day driving home they would not budge in taking the vehicle back and swopping it for one that has Apple car play. The best I could do was have them agree to shorten my lease and me pay more. A sour experience and one that ended my  loyalty to the Mercedes Benz brand and of course this dealership.< /Text>

This is my second car from Mercedes-Benz of Temecula. The first time I came was in June 2019 Lee and Elon were AMAZING. I left with a brand new 2019 GLC 300 Coupe. I got exactly what I wanted. How could I complain? A few days ago I went to sell Mercedes-Benz my GLC back because I didn’t love it anymore and was paying entirely too much for it as a lease. Initially I was being helped by Huck and that didn’t go too well. For some reason, my current Account- my GLC wasn’t showing on my credit report. So Huck didn’t want to give me the deal we worked on for about 3 hours. So I left.

I slept on it and decided I would prefer to pay the negative equity on my GLC. Just to get rid of it because I was paying entirely too much to barely drive it. My credit is exceptional, never missed a payment and I make decent money. I called the dealership to ensure the numbers, so when I came down to make that payment- I was paying the amount I had in my head. Huck wasn’t in. So Elon took my call and Elon was the guy who helped me in 2019 and he was great. So he was determined to figure out what what wrong. I needed to have a fraud interview with Mercedes-Benz and that day I came in and signed and left with my 2020 CLA 250.

Big thanks to Chris, Elon, Gene and Lee for making it happen.< /text>

I purchased a car last week Aug 2019. This was the easiest and best car buying experience I ever had. I initially came in for a test drive after corresponding by email and text after making an online inquiry. I arrived at 7pm on a Saturday night after spending most of the day at the beach and intended to just look and then come back another day when I had my trade-in vehicle with me and maybe some paperwork.This wasn’t a problem for my salesman Alex at all he was able to let me test drive the car and on less then 20 minutes had my approval. I signed papers and was out of there by 9pm. I have never spent such a short period of time at a dealership. The service was great, everyone introduced themselves and I felt my business was appreciated even though I was Leasing their smallest and most economical option, I was treated like I was buying their Maybach! I highly recommend this dealership and Alex and will go back for sure.<//review>

< review>
My wife and I were next door at the Audi dealership. We went so she could try a few options there before picking her next car. She had never picked her own car before, I always just went and got her one when the previous lease was ending. At any rate the plan was to have her test the Q8 which she was really attracted to but scared of because it’s much larger than her current Land Rover Discovery Sport. And then try a crossover or midsized model, the Q3 or Q5 and maybe even try a sedan or one of their wagons before making a decision. Just to give herself the opportunity to try out the options. Long story short, the gentleman at the Audi dealership took one look at us ( to be fair I was just wearing jeans and an old band tee, she had on a very casual outfit and our daughter was taking a nap so as he approached us while we got out of my truck we probably appeared a bit disheveled, transferring her from the car seat to the stroller )and talked her out driving the Q8 and had her test a base model Q7. I stayed with our daughter in the show room. After a short drive she was very unimpressed with the trim level having driven the Q8 prestige in Carlsbad a few weeks prior. I asked if he could pull out a few more options for her to test while our daughter was still asleep because once she woke the chance of us having a chance to rationally discuss the options would diminish and the idea of making a decision would likely disappear all together. He said, “They’re all Audi. They all drive the same. Why don’t you guys take a look around the show room   And decide what you want” . I asked if he meant to tell me the base model q3 offered the same driving experience as say an sq5 or the Q8 prestige trim level and so we went next door to Fletcher Jones’s Mercedes of Temecula. In all honesty we’d never really considered a Benz for our family. My wife never saw one up to that day that compelled her visually and all of my friends and colleagues seem to have either  upper tier e class or s class as their daily drivers and so The brand always just seemed so average to me.
And then she saw it. I won’t say which model but I will tell you this, she saw the AMG version and fell immediately in love. We just went to look not buy but I knew the second I saw her response to that vehicle that we’d be leaving with it: however, I had no idea how painless, even enjoyable the team at fletcher jones was going to make the leasing process. Michael was our sales rep and he went above and beyond and above again to make certain we had excellent service, got the best possible options available, (the first one she saw it turned out didnt have the color interior she wanted,  or heated or cooled seats which she wanted and in short order Michael rounded up one that had all the options we wanted and a few we hadn’t really considered yet, but were happy have included) and worked quite a surprisingly good deal out to keep our monthly down, maintain zero out of pocket and roll in the maintenance and the lease protection program, all under the initial figure I told him I was willing accept as a monthly payment. Not only that but we were in and out of there in under 2 hours. Let that sink in. Under 2 hours to purchase/ lease a vehicle. I’ve had it take longer to upgrade my phone. I know what you’re saying, no way, this is too good to be true, there’s no way I’d have the same experience there. Listen, give these guys a shot at your business, you won’t be disappointed. Wayne, the finance guy was so easy going and great with our daughter, by the time we left it felt like saying goodbye to an old friend, each member of their sales and support staff were genuinely warm and welcoming to us and were all so sweet to our daughter. We immediately felt welcomed to the Mercedes family and if that is any indication of how the relationship with this brand is going to be, we will always have at least one in the garage. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.< /review>

< review>
Mercedes Benz of Temecula once again did an outstanding Job!!! After a lot of patience with me (indecisive), Chad helped me find the perfect car for me. This process took 3 days total and not once did I feel pressured to get a car.  Chad answered all questions I had and explained some of the cool features.  Once I traded in my previous car, Chad helped me transfer everything from the old car to the new.  These small things matter.  Debbie from finance helped me again in understanding the financial side with the pros and cons of leasing. Debbie advice and do not regret the decision I made.  To top it off, Debbie found out that getting a new car would put a little over 4k in my pocket. This is because of the warranty i still had on my other car and the gab insurance.  This is money you would get back FYI. Not everyone would tell you these things or have knowledge of it.  I strongly recommend Mercedes of Temecula.</review>

<text>I came in first time getting myself a Mercedes! I honestly felt intimidated and scared going by myself . I was sooooo glad I had someone as helpful and knowledgeable as Cali Joe ! Paired with his awesome accent and great customer service skills, I was able to find the best choice for me - a 2020 E350 😍 Gracias Joe !!
Jackie was so accommodating and helped me get the deal I wanted-plus more ! Everyone here was so kind, helpful, and I can say this was the most relaxing and enjoyable car buying experience. I will continue to come here even after I move to the OC.<//text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I was not thrilled about my service at all from beginning to the end. First they had me standing in hot sun waiting for my advisor who I found out later was at lunch at my scheduled time, although water was offered it was warm. I had to request cold water twice in order for me to get it. Then I was passed on to a couple of people who asked the same repetitive questions. Who was I hear to see and do I have an appointment. I called to ask for explanation on price on schedule b service and no response by phone. Then I texted that was the only response I received and it seemed generic. I think it is very very unprofessional to text consumers when they have an active concern. It was so Unpardonable. Then the loaner car smelled like cigarettes upsetting my allergies. My car was dirty upon arrival as well. This service was the words experience I ever had at a car dealership. I never experienced this with BmW!! I have 2 Mercedes and  I will be trading one in soon. But the service here will definitely make me shop at another dealership. Furthermore I called for service on my next vehicle and was told that if I scheduled it at 10 am I won’t get a loaner I will have to use enterprise even with an appointment, that is unacceptable. I also asked Sam who was the service manager and who can I voice my concerns and I still haven’t received a response< /Review>

<text>Cheated 70 year old senior...I wanted a SUV and was told that they did not have the one that I wanted on the lot but offered me another car to buy.  Rami (Salesman) told me if I buy this car that it might take him a month or two to get the one that I wanted (on video and in text) and then would be able to put me in that car.  Talked to owner Garth Blumenthal and showed him video and text messages that promised me this SUV and he feels sorry for me but wants another 4,000 dollars to do it. Otherwise kiss off and get out of my building.  Out comes the greed and whatever you do don't back your salesmen.. No ethics, no integrity, and no honesty...what were you expecting from a Mercedes dealership. I am a traffic school teach what do you think I'm going to tell my students.<//text>< pictures>

This is the best car dealership that I’ve been too ever!  I was skeptical at first because I felt intimidated by the Mercedes Dealerships but actually we made an excellent choice.👍🏼  Here we were at 8:00 pm on a cool winter evening.  Alberto Dias walked out and I know the thought that we were just looking 👀 not really going to purchase a vehicle.   But hubby knew just what he wanted and regardless of how well the other cars looked he like the one that he first seen.  The Temecula Mercedes Benz Dealership is Outstanding!  It has proven to me that you don’t buy apples when you’re looking for peaches 🍑.
They are very knowledgeable of their vehicles here, friendly, caring and impeccable Customer Service that is why I gave them 10 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.

DAY 2 of PART 2
And guess what happened next?!  Yes I gotta Benz too.
Honestly purchasing a car was the last thing on my mind.  I loved my little KIA Soul BUT.........like Tupac said, “. PICTURE ME ROLLIN”. 😂Well at that time the song was in my head when test drove the car.  But again I received same Outstanding customer service Alberto was very patient with me and I really gotta sweetheart deal.  I compared prices and miles on the cars of the same make and model.   The only thing that I didn’t care for was the rate and hubby took the deal to our credit union for a better rate.  Other than that check out this dealership and ask for Alberto Diaz.  You won’t be dissatisfied.  ☺️.<//review>< Response>

My step-father recently bought a new 2018 CLA Mercedes here and also took my car and his car for a free car wash there. Never have I seen my vehicle looking so clean before. The staff there, especially Omar, are excellent. Only a handful of dealerships that I have been to offer hospitality and professionalism as good as they do at Mercedes Benz of Temecula. I highly recommend utilizing their services if you are interested in purchasing a vehicle.< /review>

Just purchased a Sprinter Van at Mercedes Benz Temecula.
When we arrived, we were disappointed to learn that the specific van we saw online was not in the dealership anymore, and since we had very specific requirements we were not too hopeful that we could find an alternative. Omar Sahar and his manager went beyond our expectations, listening to our needs and offering an upgraded version of the van for a competitive price. Then the price and financing negotiation and went very smoothly and transparently. We left happy with a better van than we expected! They even delivered the Van 80 miles from Temecula for free and with very flexible schedule!<//review>

<Review>Chris Lanza is a class act and veteran professional General Manager who got me an amazing car when old medical bills were making it tough for me to get credit.

Alex the Internet Fleet Manager was extremely courteous and professional.

This IS THE ONLY Mercedes dealer I recommend in San Diego and Riverside County.

And trust me, I’ve owned 911 Turbos, E63 S AMGs, Cayenne Turbos, and race cars.

Highly recommend!</Review><Date>1548973402912< /Date><userid>109854844849088855078<//userid>< Rate>

<Review>Went in here to look at a cargo van of which they have many. No help at first and then one of the sales managers drove me around to take a look, really nice dealership and product seems top notch.

Later I was deferred to a sales person named Lauren Rose. She went on to send me an email without any information therein. I responded that I would like the price and specs of the vehicle...no response. After two more tries and no response I gave up and went to Riverside Mercedes. Much better.< /Review><GmapID>0x80db7e17bf3a99c7:0xfef7a7e4ee43b04a</GmapID><Resp>{'time': 1478115981889, 'text': 'Hello Brad,\n\nI am very sorry to hear of the recent experience with Mercedes-Benz of Temecula.

I am highly impressed with the exceptional customer service and attention Mercedes of Temecula provides. I recently purchased a vehicle and my salesperson, Melanie, was extremely knowledgeable and attentive throughout the entire process. She made us feel like part of the family which really added comfort and trust during the buying -process. Jason in finance and John the manager were equally as helpful and courteous every time we walked onto the premises. Phenomenal quality of service and outstanding personnel made it an easy choice to buy at this dealership. If there were more "stars" to give....I would!<//Text>

Best Mercedes Bens dealer in the South West IMO.   Better then Palm Springs, San Diego, and Escondido.  The employees are very welcoming.   They answer their phones with a smile. Very personable, and they even walked me around not just telling where to go with directions.  ALL MB dealers should take note of these wonderful people.  I will be going here for all my MB.  FIVE STAR!

Worked with Rod he was great. Change oil for a S500 is about 120.00  Be sure you sign up for the Mercedes membership at their website for some discounts. Going here makes you proud to be a Owner. They even offer complementary car wash. They also did a follow up phone call to see if the visit went well.  THIS DEALERSHIP and their employees will for sure be noticed here in the southwest.< /review>

<text>I bought my Previously owned MB at a Costa Mesa dealership as that was the only place I could find my exact car in my exact colors. But when it came time for taking care of some minor, but important "repairs" to my previously owned Mercedes Benz, I was treated at the Temecula branch like I had bought my car there. I was very happy with my service both from Michael, my rep, and Mike the mechanic.< /text>< Pics>

I came in about a simple question, if they can do wiring for the hitch on my husband's sprinter. They greeted me nicely, but nobody seem to know or want to answer my question. I waited for over an hour for them to find the person to help me, which never came, so then I just left. The place barely had any customers, and I watched how all staff just walked around the place and didn't seem busy at all. So my experience with them was a waste of time.<//text>

The staff was very friendly and personable in helping me with choosing my car and working out the payment I could afford. This is my first Mercedes and I will never drive another make of car. I love the time they spent with me and the "no pressure" atmosphere. I am going for a personal training time with my salesman to learn about all the special technology my car has.
Thank you so much and I am so excited to finally own a Mercedes, the safest car on the road!< /Text>

Alvaro in service is truly exceptional! He delivers results and repairs in a timely fashion, cares about his customers, and keeps customers informed regularly about the status of their vehicle. He is one of a kind and each time I am at Mercedes Benz Of Temecula for just a car wash, it's always a classy and wonderful experience!< /review>

Clearly, I had the "WoW" factor just walking into the dealership for the first time!  Truly this dealership is the MODEL for all others to emulate after for exceptional customer service and caring about your customers!  Mr. Antony Chandler your team of PROFESSIONAL are true examples of  "Excellence in all they do!"!  Please except my sincere gratitude from the bottom of my heart - I have never ever experience anything close to the care and attention I received "Thank you!" I felt like I was the most important person in the dealership! -  Please know that Mr. Charlie Martinez is a "ROCK-STAR" he went above and beyond to ensure that I was 100 percent satisfied with my purchase, I will always have room at the table for him and his family every Thanksgiving!!!!   Sam knowledge is "SECOND to NONE" he is a "CLASS ACT!"  He went over ever detail 3 times to ensure I knew everything in which the car had to offer (OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE)!  Mr. Martinez (Salesman) I will be returning very soon and will bring my wife's car and again I am excited and look forward for another great Mercedes-Benz and great customer service experience!!!!   GOD BLESS YOU ALL at FLETCHER JONES Mercedes of Temecula!!!!<//Text>

For quite a while, I was planning to buy a new car. I did a little bit of research and MB of Temecula grabbed my attention for its positive reviews; so I decided to give it a try.

They have fair prices and excellent customer service.
I was helped by PETER, who simply offered me an irresistibly awesome deal and made the whole process easy. Their sales manager KAZ was flexible enough to make adjustments on the fly, which was impressively considerable.
Also TRAVIS walked me through all the features and functionalities of my new car. His instruction was very informative and he covered all the details.

I got the car I wanted, and I’m absolutely satisfied with my experience. I recommend MB of Temecula to those who are looking to buy a Mercedes.

No wonder they have such a high customer satisfaction score --- They well earned it!!<//Review>

<Review>What ever happened to customer service!  I'm on my third vehicle through this dealer, when they first opened they would bend over backwards for a customer now i don't know. I went to drop my car off for a wash and was rudley told i have to come back at 8:00, well i have to be at work at 8:00. I asked if i could just leave it like i've done many times in the past and pick it up later and was told unfortunately not. Now that's what i call CUSTOMER SERVICE! You guys need to reevaluate your customer service practices!!!<//Review><name>Ultra Mix<//name>< UserId.>

I have been to service here at least 3 times, car wash weekly, and the dealership is nothing short of outstanding. I am never going to be  leasing an S class, but I am treated as if I am buying a custom AMG every time, and that level of service is priceless. I have never in my life had a salesperson or a dealership work so hard to keep and support my business, and go over and above to make sure I get the best deal possible. They even called me back once to re-sign because they managed a better rate after the deal was done!! I am not kidding! Do yourself a favor and if you want a tremendous car at the best price, call Enzo, visit Mr. Chandler, and genuinely feel as if you are being treated like the most important customer they have. It's a special place and again, Enzo is a really special person. Thank you Enzo, thank you Mr. Chandler, you have given our family another very happy holiday season! Cheers!

EDIT 9/26/2020 - We thought this last lease would be the one we bought, but, with the kind and skilled assistance of Mr. Robert Crabtree we seamlessly exited our almost expired lease and landed in the most amazing 2020 C-Class. Once again, MB Temecula treated us like family, and honored our loyalty by making this process so easy and so financially favorable for us. This is our dealership! Thank you Bob!</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO76jpvziN9DoEfh1EY2kZANmV-Ifi823KGCrJZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>{'time': 1479856925099, 'text': 'Hello Cristian, thank you for providing your feedback.

I am usually skeptical of taking a car to a dealer for service...the thought being that you pay much more than you might need to.  Working with Sam LaFoca resulted in a truly exceptional experience not only because of the quality service, but because he worked very hard to lower my costs.  It may be the first time in over 30 years of owning cars that I've paid significantly less than the estimate.  While this may not happen every time, I appreciate the serious desire to value me as a customer and earn my business.  The entire team at this dealer clearly is serious about providing customers with exceptional service.<//Text>

The parts are Mercedes, but the 30-45 minute wait every time you go there to pick up something you've already ordered and just want to pay for and take away is a bit of a deterrent. Maybe a little more customer service on the parts side.</text>

Before you decide on a vehicle and make a deal, it is well worth the trip to this dealership.    You will find that everyone (from the GM to janitor) makes you feel comfortable. It is not put on act, go there and find out for yourself and you will not be disappointed.< /text>

One of the worst car buying experiences I have ever had. All was going well until I realized that they had not registered my sprinter as a commercial vehicle. Over a year later and they still can’t get it right. Lauren Rose and her incompetent team keep telling me they are handeling it and that they will get back to me and then I don’t hear anything. Then I call back and they act like they don’t know who I am or what I’m talking about. I’ve done this 5 times and still the problem is not rectified. Expect so much more from Mercedes. I will never buy from Mercedes Benz of Temecula.</review>

Always a great experience when I visit them. I was there on Saturday August 2nd 2014 and as before, Mercedes Benz Temecula provides Consistently great service and hospitality. I love this particular Mercedes dealership. They really make you feel welcomed and at home. Everyone that works there are true and really genuine, not just helping you as if they have too.<//Text>

They failed to inspect it and two days after I bought it the transmission failed. They told me to take it to the GMC dealer for an estimate. I did so and confirmed the transmission needed to be replaced. They told me I bought it as is but they would pay 1/3 of the cost then sent me a check for even less. I shop their for peace of mind guess I was wrong. General Manager was notified with no resolve. I will take this to top management.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80db7e17bf3a99c7:0xfef7a7e4ee43b04a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
MB Temecula just opened.  When I went in even though it was a Tuesday afternoon, they seemed busy, but everyone greeted me with a smile.  I was introduced to a salesman, Bob Crabtree, who while a car (and MB) veteran, had only been on the job at MB Temecula for a few days.

Bob was amazingly helpful, even though I had no intention of purchasing a vehicle that day.  He went above and beyond what I would have expected.  By the time we were done chatting, he actually gave me a deal better than even I was asking for and I ended up purchasing the vehicle.

The entire team at MB Temecula is there, from the GM Antony to the Sales Manager Vince, they all were amazingly helpful.  Temecula is all about community and treating people right.  The business that succeed here get that.  MB Temecula is off to a great start in that fashion.  They understand us and are not a typical auto mall type operation.  They are really here to succeed and want to be a part of our neighborhood.

I have purchased several cars in my life, and this was by far the most painless, and dare I say, enjoyable experience.  I look forward to poking my head in weekly when I'm getting my free car wash just to see the goings on.

Thank you very much MB Temecula team!< /review>

I met with my Mercedes Service Advisor Ramon Ventura on November 30, 2016, and for the third year in a row was treated with extreme professionalism, exceptional product knowledge, trusted advise, Ramon instills confidence with his thoroughness as well as his valued suggestions. Ramon listens attentively and genuinely cares about the customers personal concerns.    My alternate battery light had come on and I showed up without an appointment, Ramon as he always does makes you feel important, like a VIP, he arranged for my battery to be immediately replaced, washed my car and I was back on the road within an hour.  Ramon has exceptional people skills, looks out for the customers best interest, makes suggestions when appropriate,  and satisfies your every need.  The confidence I have in Mercedes of Temecula is exceptional.  Always a wonderful experience. What a pleasure it is to interface with this Dealership. Amazing people.< /text>

< Review>
I had a very bad experience with this place.  I emailed and spoke with several dealerships to get a feel for car discounts offered.  In the Temacula dealership, I spoke with Nolen. He was not very forthcoming with pricing but told me that Temacula is the new kid on the block and would beat any other deal I would be given.  So, I later called him back and told him what he needed to do to get my business. He said he had the right car on the lot and could get me the price I wanted. I told him I would come over if the deal was approved by the manager. He asserted it was. Except, when I got to the place, Nolen had disappeared. Alex, a senior salesman with an office full of trophies, took over. He showed off the self-parking feature and other attractions of the car, probably hoping I would fall head over heel in love. When I reminded him of the promised deal, he disappeared and fast-talking Jackie showed up. She said she was going to give me a discount she had never given in her whole life.  That was barely better than the Edmonds recommended price. Trick number two in her book was to offer a much cheaper car at the promised price. Trick number three was to offer the promised price for a 51 months lease instead of 36. Next, general manager Elan came in. His tactic was to sound very sincere and promise to make things happen. Then let me sit and wait while nothing happened. In short, this is not the place to go for honesty or for a good deal.  If you want those, go to Laguna Niguel or LA downtown.</Review>

Without a doubt, Mercedes-Benz of Temecula afforded me the most pleasant of all dealership experiences. Traveling through CA I experienced a motor warning signal requiring immediate attention. Since I was traveling in a Mercedes Sprinter 3500, the dealership had to be specific, thus I traveled an hour, one way, off route. Frustrated and tired, I was met with exceptional kindness and hospitality by every member of the staff. The competence of the service department was without question and the help was immediate. My gratitude especially goes to Ramon Ventura, my service provider.</text>

The E350 was one of 3 options which I had in mind.  After driving it and reviewing the option package I knew that this was on the top of the list.  What took it over the top was the service provided by Jason Keck.  He knew the car, he was easy to work with, he had a great personality and he ensure we were taken care of.  Jason is highly recommended.</Text>

Melanie @ Mercedes Benz of Temecula was Selling and Professionalism in one package.

She understood our needs and did an excellent job of QUALIFYING us as to those needs.   She wasted no time, but yet remained dedicated and pleasant to the task.

We will remain a friend and partner with Melanie in her reflection of Fletcher Jones standards.  We have a lot to learn about our new Chariot, but Melanie will see this happens in the followup visits.

A textbook definition of exceptional customer service, on every level: from qualifying, to selection, to delivery. I particularly want to thank Alex Aftahi and Jason Hardin, who went above and beyond, but my whole experience has been both extremely pleasant, and extremely reassuring, from my initial conversation with Victoria Wang, and going forward, to date.

Service advisor Reza was on point and took care of us. This was our first visit to Mercedes Temecula. My wife’s 2006 E350 needed service and the attention to client was concierge quality. Hard to impress my wife and they did it with flying colors. Will return in the future. Again excellent rating for Reza Nejad for exceptional care and attention.

<Review>Recently purchased a certified pre-owned car. I was very impressed with the courteous and professional staff, as well as how immaculate and spacious the dealership is. I was introduced to staff members that I will be working with in the future and truly treated as a VIP.

Just traded in my 2015 S550 and leased a new 2018 S560.  My salesman both times was Bob Crabtree and he is my go to guy for anything I need at Mercedes Benz.  I was also pleased that since I had already leased once before, that the paperwork was much easier and faster to get through.  My only complaint is Run Flat tires.  I had a two flat's with Run Flat Tires and found out that Run Flat tires cannot be fixed.  You will be purchasing new tires which cost me $450 each.</text>

Sales Rep, Melanie Rhoan, was gracious in providing amazing service. She was very courteous and patient in understanding what I wanted in a new vehicle.
The facility was fully stocked with endless option.
Highly recommended for those considering Mercedes-Benz in Temecula and in neighboring cities within Riverside County.</Text>

If one reads the reviews one thing comes across, the service is not good. From my view is is spot on. Called over 2 weeks ago said would call back in 20 minutes...still waiting. Called 5 days later and still waiting.
The reply from MBT just goes to show service needs a lot of help.. I don't own a van. No wonder they can't get it right. Feel sorry for the guy with the van.<//review>

< review>
Highest reviews for Mercedes-Benz of Temecula! I was in a terrible rollover accident due to a reckless driver, but my 2014 Mercedes ML 350 protected me from suffering major physical injuries. The frame of the vehicle and other features proved how much attention Mercedes pays to safety. The first responders noted that my "German tank" probably saved my life. Unfortunately, my vehicle was a total loss, but having walked away from such a serious accident, I knew I'd be buying another Mercedes. I was glad I chose Mercedes-Benz of Temecula! They have a beautiful new facility and large fleet of vehicles from which to choose. I found exactly what I was looking for--a 2018 GLE. Alex Aftahi, fleet manager, provided exceptional service. He was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. From the minute I walked in the door to the minute I left the dealership, every single person was friendly, professional, and helpful. It's without hesitation that I highly recommend Mercedes vehicles and Mercedes-Benz of Temecula!</review>

They answered all of my questions, and they even took the time to provide me with additional information about my pending purchase.   Once I purchased the car, they helped me install my Bluetooth, and Vincent provided me with an instructional video on how to program my garage door opener.

Furthermore, after purchase, they both continued to offer assistance.  For example,, when I brought the car back to take advantage of the car was feature, they both have gone out of their way to make sure that I’m happy with my car.

To me ,their continued support means a great deal .

They both represent Fletcher Jones of Temecula very well.

I always get nervous dropping my car off for service at any dealership.  This Mercedes Benz dealership, however, is of a different breed.  The service department is candid and truthful; I do not feel like I am being sold "sand in the desert."  Mercedes Benz of Temecula was able to resolve the issue with very little work.  They did not charge me an exorbitant fee and, in fact, they cut the diagnostic fee because the repair was very minimal.  Thus, I ended up spending less than I originally thought I would have spent.  I will definitely continue to use Mercedes Benz of Temecula in the future!<//Review>

< Review>
It is very happy to deal with them! I preordered a GLS 450 after comparing with other  3 San Diego dealers. Alex is very sincere and frank, he just gave me the best price on the phone, so I decided to pay a visit despite of 1 hour drive.  I changed optional equipment 3 times  after ordering,  Alex always make things happen very quickly.
when I picked up the  new car, they  were so thoughtful,  from the full gas to  bringing back my old car. I enjoyed the Luxury  experience with them which should be with Benz.
Highly recommend!!

recommend you to my friends.</Review>

<text>We (my husband and I) had the worst experience at this location and so called their sister location in Newport Beach Fletcher Jones...I have been a loyal customer of Mercedes Benz for a long time as I have purchased and owned several vehicles from them over the years. Really thought to help the local dealer to purchase our next new vehicle. However, we were hugely surprised as to how this dealership plays tricky games to sell their vehicles. This was after a number of calls received from their sales people. Although we were a little alarmed a bit with the bad experience we had with their service department over a year ago for the maintenance of our previous vehicle, but thought that their sales department will be different. Due to our bad experience, we would never recommend them to anyone and neither to buy anything from them.

At the end of the day. I think it may not be the Temecula and Newport Beach locations of Fletcher Jones, but the people that work there may be contributing towards having them look so bad...

Finally we decided to buy from our previous dealer Keyes European, had to travel a bit of distance to get it, but it was 100% worth it! Straight forward people and deliver on what they promise, very happy that we went back to them!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1502923768939, 'text': 'Hello,\nThank you for taking the time to speak with me today.

On March 11 we purchased a 2014 M Class . My wife and I would highly recommend Rami Jaouhari to anyone who is looking for a vehicle. He wasn't pushy at all. He listened to what we had to say and then showed us what might fill our needs. He was patient and answered all our questions and also gave us some great suggestions. He was with us from the start to the actual delivery of the vehicle. I would also highly recommend Fletcher Jones dealership. They truly seem to be trying to make the customer happy.< /text>

We came to MB of Temecula specifically because of Rod Carey! He has been our car advisor for over 10 years! Relationships are very important to my husband and I. Not only is Mr. Carey a wonderful person he is an excellent and trusted advisor. We literally tracked him down and found him here at MB Temecula! The service at MB Temecula was impeccable. I needed a service B and was able to get me in quickly. There was a $96.00 saving that our local dealership would have charged us! We will appreciate the additional perks such as the free car washes being offered.
The dealership and location are beautiful. I hope MB of Temecula remains loyal and committed to customer service and satisfaction. May you Mr. Carey and the MB Temecula dealership continue to flourish and grow. Thanks,
Don Ajene and Jacqueline Wilcoxson

<Date>1442276002600< /Date><rating>1<//rating><Text>Hands down the most unprofessional, most disrespectful and uncaring dealership I've ever dealt with.
I was dealing with Alex over the phone which is probably one of their internet Managers.
All I have to say is after having to deal with him for two days, and after countless amounts of hours talking over the phone for a SIMPLE LEASE STRUCTURE.
He refuses to give me any numbers over the phone, and he tells me that I have to take the incentive to take time out of my schedule to drive an hour and a half down to Temecula to get numbers, when they could easily be said within 30 seconds over the phone.
Oh well.. Looks like you just lost my right of business.
They either need to get rid of Alex or put him through some serious customer service training skills before he could ever talk to customers the way he dealt with me.
Very unprofessional and promising of everything.
But yet i had to wait two days to get a simple task which would take just 5 minutes.
Never returning here again.
Would not recommend anyone to work with Alex.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< review>
This is review for a service department.We had an appointment set for 10 am for a simple oil change and they quoted us $118 over the phone and even game me price breakdown.They said it is going to be about 30 minutes to finish the oil change,because we have an appointment.
My wife went there today and they tried up selling her another $70 to lubricate a sunroof,which we don't even have.I spoke to a service manager on the phone,and his exact word were,we have to do it,or they will not reset service light on the car.When asked for a breakdown on what they do exactly,he gave me a breakdown,that basically included looking over hood hinges and looking in the brake reservoir to see if it's full(mind you this is a 10k mile vehicle). When I asked them if this is necessary on a vehicle so new,he basically told me,if I don't like it to take my business somewhere else.
I said,OK,just do an oil change and don't reset the light.After which,I get a call from my wife,who said,that it is going to take more than 2 hours now,because the service manager is mad at me.She didn't feel comfortable to stay there after this and left.
Service managers name is Sam Dalati,very unprofessional man if you ask me.I spoke to Rose in customers relations and she is communicating with Anthony Chandler,who is general manager at this dealership.I really hope they conduct some sort of training with Sam Dalati,so he understands how to deal with customers.<//review>

Horribile costumer service. I called them for 3 weeks straight asking to talk to the dealer that i returned the car to due to my father
passing away but he seemed to not be there everytime i called and waited for 2 hours only to find out he isnt even available i even left a message and got no calls returned. There was even a repo mercedes member looking for the car even though i returned it 4 months before they showed up to my house at 9pm at night and asked if we have the car but he didnt seem to know or communicate with the dealer because we showed them the paper work and the repo man just said sorry and left us alone he also had no clue which mercedes dealership we returned it too or when we had returned it. now we have mail that says my father owes them the rest of the payment if they dont get the full amount on their auction even though it said he only leased the car? When we finaly reached the dealer we had him update us on the car and he said he was going to figure out what was going on and he will call us back 2 hours passed and we called back only to find out he wasnt working on what we asked and that he was busy trying to make sales with another costumer.<//text>

Just called MB of Temecula thinking they would know a product from in home. No difference from an R170 SLK32 AMG as far as the drivetrain and Supercharged engine. And only a construction worker shell and different interior let you know you are in a
Chrysler Crossfire SRT6. So to the point.  MB of Temecula said they would not help me or service my AMG engine because it says Chrysler. So So sad. What ever happened to Customer Service ? If BMW made a bad choice and merged with Say Ford. I would bet they would help take my earned $$$ doing an oil change on an M-engine placed into a Escort. Thx Daimler-Chrysler for the Daimler part to turn it's backside to us. Forbid the day Mercedes-Benz drivers take their AMG cars to Mopar to be serviced. Wait that's today.<//Review>

Don’t waste your time or money
-once they sell you the car they could care less about any issues that you may have.

I don’t recommend buying your car from them.
________________________________________

I purchased a GLE350 from them along with wheel and tire protection in June or July 2017

1ST PROBLEM: The mbrace package wasn’t reset so I called them and asked if I paid the $200 it cost to reset the package would they reimburse me.. which should be a given since it should of been reset before they sold the car to me.

They said yes no problem okay, cool

2ND PROBLEM: I got my first flat tire in October if I remember correctly... so I got to my local dealer to have it replaced (for free) since I purchased wheel and tire protection... when I get there, there is no proof that I have wheel and tire protection. After 3 weeks of MB Temecuala giving me and the service advisor the run around we find out it was never processed.

I emailed them twice a week a for months and they kept handing me off to other people that kept insisting they’d take care of it and never did. Months later I called the warranty company directly to resolve the issue only to be told that Mercedes failed to submit my claim entirely.

It took me a week of working with them to get everything processed and taken care of and I am now finally getting my refund.

*From the warranty company MB TEMECULA did NOT help at all*

I also followed up about the reimbursement twice for me having to pay out of pocked for the Mbrace to be reset and they never got back to me. Completely ignored me.

This is my second time complaining in a review  , all they  do is write we’re sorry please contact so and so ... which I tried a few times and they were never able to take the call.

My MB even tells me how terrible and unprofessional They are for this...

* YOU’VE BEEN WARNED*</text>< name>

Arrived for service on my SL550, the attendant knew my name.  Showed me to the coffee bar, and escorted me to Alvaro, my Service Advisor.  My loan car was ready to go on the service drive when the paperwork was complete.  Alvaro kept me informed during the service process, and let me know when my vehicle was ready to pick up, cleaned and ready to go when I arrived.  The Service Manager, Sam, stopped by to introduce himself as I was doing the initial paperwork with Alvaro.  Very pleasant experience.  My Wife and I have purchased five vehicles from Fletcher Jones Mercedes-Benz, one in Orange County, and four in Las Vegas.  We have always been treated with courtesy and professionalism.  Welcome to Temecula, Fletcher Jones Mercedes-Benz, and keep up the good work!<//Text>

Mercedes-Benz of Temecula is one of the nicest customer service oriented Mercedes dealerships that we have dealt with over the years.  From Jason Keck in Sales to Rod Carry and Ramon Ventura in Service.
On 3/14/16, my husband took my Mercedes in for a battery replacement and informed the Service Writer Ramon Ventura, that he needed to be out by a certain time in  order to pick me up from work and to go to an appointment.  Ramon set this service as a priority and had the car serviced and washed earlier than expected.  It is always a pleasure to go into this dealership and we always recommend it to others</review>

I’m glad I had the opportunity to speak with you yesterday regarding EV charging stations; Fletcher Jones of Temecula has one EV charging stations for our  Mercedes vehicles.  However your feedback is vital to our success,  I want to assure your that your opinion and suggestions will be share with our management team for their review.\n\nYour business means a lot us and we look for to seeing you in the future.\nBest regards,\nDervonda Moore\nGuest Experience Advisor'}<//resp>
<text>My wife & I purchased a new Mercedes GLS 450 suv from this dealership about 6 months ago. So thinking that I would be treated like a customer I went into the dealership so I can use a 240 volt EV charging station (only one in this dealership) for my "Ford" PHEV - it takes about two hrs (at max) for my car to be fully charge from empty.

After few days of use, no problems. However, about a week later, I went into the dealership to get about 1 hr charge from the 240 volt EV charging station. While I was there I got a knock on the window from an older guy claiming to be a manager at this location. He gestured to roll my window down & told me straight that this wasn't permitted & made me feel unwelcome at the location. He claimed that I left the Fusion PHEV car for hours at the single EV chargiing station (which is an outrageous exaggeration as it only takes 2 hrs to fully charge the vehicle).  I asked him to talk to his manager but he just walked away. Such a class from a guy claiming to be a manger at this dealership. Hopefully, he's an exception & not the rule at this location.

Nice to know that this dealership only cares if you purchase a Mercedes GLS from them but don't give a damn when it involves another brand of vehicle.

And isn't the essence of a EV charging station all about reducing pollutant from air so we can all breath bit easier & to reduce the carbon foot print?If I was driving a Mercedes PHEV, I'm sure the outcome would have been different.

Your car shouldn't have to have three pointed star emblem at the front of the vehicle to use the EV charging station. All I wanted to do was to charge my Fusion PHEV whenever in the area but this dealership definitely made my stay very un-welcomed & treated the customer in a way that a customer shouldn't be treated. For heavens sake, put more EV charging stations that all EV drivers can enjoy...I would prefer that over a fancy water feature at the front. Substance over Superficiality any day! You might even get a side business from some of the EV drivers interested in Mercedes brand. And if this single EV charging station is only for Mercedes vehicles, put a clear sign so that there won't be any misunderstanding. I thought I was a customer but apparently that wasn't the case at this dealership.

Just as a comparison, at Temecula Gosch Ford, all EV vehicles can use the existing three 240 volt charging stations without any question...yes, even the Mercedes PHEV's.

Although I live close to this dealership, I will be taking my business somewhere else from now on.<//text>< Date>

WARNING WARNING WARNING : BEWARE OF THIS DEALERSHIP
Mercedes-Benz Fletcher Jones of Temecula:
Will sell you a NEW vehicle that has been in a accident or has had prior Damage. If you purchased a vehicle here Please have it inspected.
I purchased a new Sprinter Van about 10 months ago to transport my 85 year old mother who has Parkinson and is severely handicapped so i can get her in and out of a high top van with ease.
It was getting late in the evening so it was already getting dark. I Picked out a nice midnight blue van not even thinking that there would be any damage. While talking to the sales manager she disclosed to me that this vehicle was there oldest vehicle and it has been sitting on there lot for almost a year. I asked her why that was and she really did not have a valid answer now I know why . its because of all the damage.
After signing all the paperwork and they brought it into there bay I noticed some scratches and imperfections. Not doing a thurl inspection I had no idea the extent of the damages on the passenger side where it had been repainted. I was assured by the manager that she would file a claim to get everything fixed and put everything in writing in a due bill. So I went ahead and took the vehicle home. when i awoke the next morning i noticed a lot more damage in the sunlight. I called immediately and was told to speak with Steve Usary he is the service manager he made me an appointment and told me i would get a loaner car while they were going to get all repairs completed. I took the day off of work and drove the 3 hours it takes for me to get there. When i brought the vehicle in they brought there painter out to inspect the vehicle and my partner overheard him tell Steve that the vehicle was too big for there paint booth and had too much damage to repair at there facility . So then Steve told  me that it was beyond his approval and that he would have to file a claim with Mercedes. So I asked him can i just exchange the vehicle out for another one since i only had it for a few days and he told me no it will have to be  traded in. So i said ok im willing to trade it in then.
and he said. These are his exact words.
" WELL IF YOU TRADE IT IN I CANT GIVE YOU MUCH FOR IT BECAUSE OF THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE "    WOW can you believe that.
I was floored. then he went on to ask me if i liked how the vehicle ran and how it drove. i told him it ran great. and his response was. " WHY ARE YOU COMPLAINING YOU HAVE A NICE VEHICE. Unbelievable the audacity of this man. so in other words he saying if the vehicle runs and drives good it does not matter what it looks like. I would expect to find this guy in a 2bit used car lot NOT a new Mercedes store.  He then assured me that he would be in contact with me after he put in a claim with Mercedes.  I took it into a few body shops and got a couple estimates it was 4000 to do the passenger side and over 9000 to do the whole vehicle because there are scratch's and blemish's everywhere.
10 months later and i have still not heard anything. So i contacted Mercedes they told me it was out of there hands that it is up to Fletcher Jones to take care of it. So now im forced to take legal actions i am  getting an attorney and also contacting Channel 2 and 7 news to expose new car stores  who sell damaged vehicles and do not disclose it. I hope this dealership is there main focus and they pick up the story so more people can find out about this dealership. Im sure the owner will have a witty response but lets see what he has to say when a newscaster is knocking at his door.
So im STUCK with a new van that wherever i go i get questions on what happed to my van why is there so much damage. I have tried to trade it in several times and everywhere i go they try to give me 15-20 thousand less then what I paid. Do yourself a favor stay clear of this dealership. I thought i was safe by going to a Mercedes dealership well think again.
I NEVER thought especially a Mercedes Dealer would be capable of being so dishonest.<//review>

<Text>Had trouble with our in-warrenty Sprinter battery holding a charge. Took it in twice for service. Both times we were told there is noting wrong with electrical system or battery. Problem continued. So we took our Sprinter to another dealership ... they diagnosed the battery as faulty and replaced it. Problem solved. So, my conclusion is that Mercedes-Benz of Temecula has incompetent service employees, or they lack the integrity to resolve simple under-warrenty issues. Either way, they lost my business.< /Text>< Pics>

Upon arrival we were greeted friendly by Andre, he showed me numerous SUVs.
I did not get approved for the GLs so I was pretty bummed.
I went home and Andre called me and tried to get me into another SUV similar to the one I test drove.
It still was too much and I again didn’t get approved.
The next day Andre calls and reassured me that he was going to help me and not to worry I would be driving off with a 2018 Mercedes.
He seemed so confident and I headed there after work.
I test drove a 2018 GLE 350 and fell in love!!!

<review>This certain Mercedes dealer apparently finds that hiring young teens who must have just gotten their license is the smartest decision. I was headed to have my GLS450 that was purchased from another dealership in LA to be serviced at this dealer because it is closer to my home, on the way, there was an erratic driver who seemed to be going to the dealership also whom was swerving in lanes, brake checking people, and revving the engine... They were in a newer if not new Mercedes driving like a lunatic, you'll imagine my shock when I caught up to him before turning into the dealer and I could hear his obnoxious vulgar music without even being in the car. I couldn't make out what his name was as he took his name tag off when he saw me staring, Kasey or Kalen you need to take better care of customer cars! Unnaceptable behavior! I know I would absolutely have a heart attack if I found out my vehicle was being abused by their 'employees'. He was also vaping who knows what!!! in what was clearly not his car!!! I made a U turn and took my car to MB of Ontario instead. Much happier even though I live closer to MB of Temecula, I hope to one day be able to actually do business with you, once your driving kids mature...</review>< UserId.>

Absolute worst service experience ever. I had my vehicle towed here after talking to the service technician at 9 AM who stated that they had the part and could do the job that day, car arrived at 10 AM at the dealership. I assumed that the work had been started. I called to check on it around 5 PM and no one knew where the vehicle was. It took them 5 days to complete the work. I had also asked if the computer could be scanned to see any fault codes, I was told that if service exceeded the $200 charge that it would be waived. My bill was $1,200 and they still charged me for the scan. I discussed this problem with the costumer service specialist who assured me that it would be corrected, that was 4 months ago and I have not heard anything. It is a shame there is not an option for less than one star. Do not go here.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>This is the fifth car that I have purchased from Vincent Troncoso.  When I think about my experience over the years, the words Amazing, Awesome, Professional, Honest, Trustworthy, First Class, World Class all come to mind.  However, the truth of the matter is that are no words that justly describe what an incredible experience it is working with Vincent Troncoso and the Mercedes-Benz of Temecula team.  The reality is that they are in a class of their own, unlike any other.  Vincent always works as hard to get me what I want and get the deal done as he would for himself.  In December, I purchased a 2015 ML250.  Friday, I purchased a 2015 C300.  Yet again, I have 2 gorgeous Mercedes-Benz sitting in my garage.  Thank you Vincent!< /Text>< pics>

Michael and the quality of the vehicle changed our minds when we were already fairly settled on another vehicle. The service and attention to every detail of our purchase was far superior to the other dealerships we recently visited. Our contact with Deby Galman in finance, and the support staff was top notch as well.

Michael had us come back the following week so he could answer our questions about the car's functions. We are very happy with the car and the sale and have shared our experience with friends.< /Review>< resp>

Had a simple, straightforward and fantastic experience, leasing a B-class Electric Drive. Wonderful (as has been for the past few MB leases) to continue working with Vincent, now in this nice and new location. Everyone who handled the lease - including Jackie and Omar were wonderful - professional, courteous and very helpful. Surely worth the drive, if you aren't in the neighborhood. And knowing that my old-time favorite service advisor is now at MB Temecula ... gives me comfort that my new car will be in good hands, when it comes in for a service.< /text>

Had my CLs550 taken to this dealer by AAA.

I told service dept. staff ( Michael ) that I wanted fuel pump replaced. Michael stated that mechanics stated that is was not the fuel pump, but is was a part called a SAM that was bad.

They replaced the SAM, guess what, it was not the problem, they removed the SAM, but want me to pay for the labor to put in and remove the SAM.

I have filed a claim, with CAr. I was told by CAr, that the SAM part has nothing to due with the fuel system

Update 12/28/2017
The service manager called, total jerk.
Iam 63 years old, have Mercedes autos all my life.

THIS MERCEDES DEALER IS THE worst auto repair service I have experienced in 50 years of driving. The janitorial staff, has better people's skills.

Total scam here !!!</Text>

<Text>Seriously LOOK NO FURTHER!!  This dealership is THE ABSOLUTE BEST!  My husband and I went in to check out a car we had seen listed online and were immediately greeted with sincere salesmen & women who didn't seem like the typical car dealership vultures!  They calmly asked us if we would like a water, soda, coffee or even a latte!  I was immediately a fan of this place!  We were introduced to Antony Chandler, the GM, who was equally as sincere as the rest of the salesforce. He placed us with Melanie Roane, one of the NICEST, most helpful and patient saleswomen we've ever had the chance to work with!  We gave her our budget and exactly what we were looking for and she showed us 2 cars that she thought we would love - and we did, neither of which were over our budget (THANK YOU MELANIE!)!  We test drove both and had lots of questions about how certain things worked and she was SO incredibly patient with us, answering each and every question with some pretty incredible knowledge!  She really knows her Mercedes!  She was NEVER pushy or rude, but rather like a big sister, helping us get into the right car for us and our budget!  We actually ended up closing the dealership down, way after their normal business hours in order to finish writing everything up... and she, Antony (the GM), the finance guy and a sweet as can be detailer stayed there until the moment we drove off the lot!  It felt a little bit like we were royalty at points!  This dealership is not only BEAUTIFUL, it's an incredible experience, from beginning to end!  We can't recommend them highly enough!!

<username>James H</username><userid>111786053453325149875< /userid><Review>Fletcher Jones Mercedes-Benz of Temecula partook in unethical acts and maybe fraud after I “leased” a 2017 GLC 300 from them on 10/5/2017 because:
10/23/2017: I noticed the SRS and passenger airbag light intermittently remained on indicating a problem with the airbags. This is significant because according to NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) the SRS light is an indicator of airbag malfunction in relation to the airbag safety recall issued on 10/6/2017. And, must be repaired before being driven i.e. an inadvertent driver airbag deployment may cause a risk of injury to the driver and might increase the risk of a potential crash.
10/30/2017: I had the car towed in for repair, the service tech was able to duplicate the problem and stated they fixed the car on 11/1/2017… However, I questioned their actions, believe the safety recall problem was not fixed. Because, the “airbag” safety recall has no remedy for repair until mid-2018…
11/4/2017: I informed Mr. S Lofoca (service consultant) I was aware of the recall on my car, questioned how the air bag issue could be fixed when the manufacture states there is no remedy for repair. But, was advised the cars airbag repairs are unrelated to the recall…
I asked Mr. Lofoca how he can be so sure the air bag won’t inadvertently deploy if the problem was not fixed and was advised “he cannot guarantee me the airbags wont inadvertently deploy but, the there is only a small chance of that occurring.
I advised Mr. Lofoca I was not willing to take that chance and request that he either fix the car or, provide a loaner until it can be repaired.  However, Per Mr. Lofoca, “I understand the car has an airbag safety recall but, I will not grant you a loaner.”
I pleaded with Mr. Lofoca for a loaner vehicle explaining I feared an inadvertent airbag deployment could lead to my family being seriously hurt. Or at worst killed.  But, was again advised by Mr. Lofoca, he could not help me.
As a result, I refused to take possession of the car  in hopes they will read this post and do the right thing.</Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I just leased a 2018 GLC 300 from MB of Temecula and I cannot say enough nice comments on how Omar Sahar was to deal with. He walked me through a couple different cars and worked the numbers to where it was affordable. The time she spent in working out the details without a bunch of back and forth was awesome!

Then I was introduced to the General Manager Evon, where he took a real sincere concern that they find me the right car and at the right price for my budget. They wound up having to go to another Fletcher Jones dealer to find the RIGHT car, and had it delivered the next day-wow!!

Then off the Finance and Javier was professional, concise, and courteous and POOF...out of there in less than an hour. He reviewed the numbers, payment, etc. Great experience!!

While the care was being prepped, Omar walked me through the entire Dealership, to the coffee lounge, to the owners lounge, heck...even showed me where the restrooms were-haha. Then he took me to service, introduced me to the Service Advisor and showed me where to bring the car for my complimentary washes.

I have literally purchased or leased dozens of cars...this is my second Mercedes from Temecula, and the way I was treated during the entire sales process, confirms I made the right choice in their dealership and it will not be my last.

Thank You to the entire Team at Mercedes of Temecula for a great experience!

<Text>Bought my first Mercedes Benz car at this dealership 5 years ago when it opened. I was not satisfied at the time but now I am after buying our second vehicle so I have changed my review. Andre Serpoosh is the man. Promote this guy. Hooked it up. Also meet Ken Roycroft. He even invited me to some veteran event in months. Love this place Veteran friendly.

My experience with Temecula Mercedes exceeded my expectations, thanks to Melanie Rhoan.  I Emailed some standard non interested comment last November.  Well, she followed up on it which surprised me.  Of course I immediately thought another pushy sales person.  Well these calls and Emails continued thru this month.  I finally decided to make a appointment and end these communications.

I finally met Melanie, what a surprise, I felt I had just met a old friend.  She made me feel at home, not pushing me immediately toward their rows of cars, instead, chatting about how I liked the Mercedes I had, giving us water and just chatting.  I finally asked to look at cars.  They only had one that had just came in that I liked.  It was a new color that had just came out.  As it turned out, there there was nothing to be had in my second choice.

We sat down to discuss figures after she drove me all over the parking lot about four times.  The first one I looked at and liked had every feature that I wanted on it.  Well, after a short wait, which usually takes about three hours she came back with a number.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I got a very fair price for my car and a fair price for the new one, that I didn.'t feel the need to even try to go back and forth with the price.  It took about hour to settle that.

The general manager came by to introduce himself and several other employees.  Then finance.. Thanks to Debi, that went also friendly, pleasant, and fast.  The whole experience was great, thanks to Melanie.  I would recommend Mercedes of Temecula to anyone ready to purchase a new car.  Plus free car washes.  Always ask for Melanie< /Text>

<text>What good is it to purchase their extra protection plan if it will not cover a back up camera? The finance guy told me to purchase their extra protection plan because the newer mercedes benz are fully computerized and those electronics cost a lot when they go out. My back up camera went out, and the service department is saying they won't cover it and it will cost me $1100 (Mind you I paid extra for their protection plan)

I call back to ask for my sales rep Omar only to find out that he's off today.So the girl at reception asks what the nature of my call was and when I explained, she said she would patch me through to "Rose" in guest relations. Low and behold I am told she is out to lunch and she offered to put me through to voicemail. I have an appointment to go and test drive the new E300, but I am not going to be purchasing another brand new mercedes from this dealer. I feel like I was sold the extra protection plan under false pretense. I am going to take the loaner car back and deal with a broken back up camera because I am not going to pay $1100. So, beware, do not let them tell you that your vehicle is covered from bumper to bumper if something goes wrong because you will be very disappointed.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1484000987386, 'text': 'Hello Armando, thank you for taking the time to speak with me.

Well, very disappointed at this horrible place. This was my 5th Mercedes it was a 550S 2015. I will not buy another at least from this dump. The service manager is a complete rude arrogant jerk. Gus basically said “ok you win, but we’re not repairing it.” $110,000 car less then 3 years abd 30,000 miles the rim cracks. They blame it on a scratch in the rim. Another example of many problems with this place: They “fixed” the smell in my wife’s car (yes we had two) after 4 visits within 2 years because the AC filter would rot. They refused to fix this at first saying she should shut off the AC and run the car for 5 minutes before shutting off the car. Shameful terrible service.

My wife and I  had an absolutely first class experience last Saturday (1/31/2015) at Mercedes Benz of Temecula where we purchased a 2012 certified pre-owned E350.  Everyone was amazing and we were treated with outmost courtesy.  I would like to thank Michael Hunter, Vincent Troncoso, Jeff Johnson, and of course Anthony Chandler, the general manger,  for treating us with such amazing class.  If you are in the market for a new or pre-owned Mercedes Benz, I would highly recommend visiting this dealership before going anywhere else, as I am certain you are going to receive an amazing car buying experience.< /Text>

Every time I pull my car close to the entrance without exaggeration in my eyes what I see, everyone stops and all eyes are on me. I instantly see the red carpet when I exit my vehicle. I am truly a VIP at Mercedes BenZ of Temcula. Vincent T. Is the reason I continue to Drive a Mercedes. Juan Carlos I could never thank enough how genuine he is when he explains everything to me in detail about my new purchase and the extra mile after the sale tells me that this will always be home where I sit my Louis Vuitton purse. Antony GM very busy man, stopped everything to take time to say hello and chat to thank me for my business. I'm a Vincent V. Fan because doing business with him has been one of the best experience I've had purchasing or leasing. I'm on Team Vincent! Thank you for another great experience xoxo<//Text>

< Review>
I am a first time buyer. I was skeptical at first with buying a mercedes-benz but after experiencing the world class service they have at fletcher-jones I am hooked. My friends accompanied me on this grand adventure of purchasing a vehicle and Andreas, our sales advisor, just made the experience wonderful. He was very courteous and knowledgeable. He gave us a tour of the beautiful lot and treated us like long time friends. The General manager came out to greet us outside and he was very friendly. In fact, everyone at the dealership were so friendly and accommodating. One more thing that really stood out, especially from first visiting BMW prior to this dealership, Andreas greeted us before we even stepped into the doors. He came out to us. It was probably one of the moments that convinced me to seriously consider this place. I know that I made a great decision after purchasing my vehicle. There was no aggressive tactics used during the deal. It was straightforward business. I am already trying to convince my fiancee to get a Mercedes from here. My friends and I were so impressed with the service that even they are already considering their next cars to be from this dealership. Thank you, Andreas, Anthony, and John for the wonderful experience. I am not sure what else I could say to capture the world class experience I had there. (For those who were wondering: I purchased a CPO, 2012 C250 Sedan and only 12,790 miles on it; a gem.)</Review>

We were looking for a very specific GL. I had visited the dealership on 3 different occasions spanning 4 months time. Coincidentally I also visited the FJ in Newport Beach being that I have an office in Newport. The experience was terribly unprofessional and left me not wanting to ever buy a car from them. I had always previously purchased vehicles at Anaheim Hills Mercedes but set aside the poor experience at FJ Newport and gave FJ Temecula a chance. We are happy we did!

During each visit to FJ Temecula the staff was extremely courteous and made us feel welcomed to be there without a high pressure sales pitch. Jason Keck and his team found the GL that we wanted at another dealership and had it shipped to the Temecula store.

From the greeter at the front to the Sales Manager Vincent and Wayne in finance (Who makes paper airplanes that my 5 year old was enamored with) we were thoroughly impressed by all! Being from OC...its nice to have the OC feel and attention to detail here locally in Temecula! Keep up the Great Service!< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating>< Review>
My husband is a BMW guy.  I went to BMW Murrieta to test drive the X3 and X5.  Unfortunately, I did not find the smooth driving experience.  I also went to the Newport Beach Fletcher Jones Mercedes-Benz dealerahp and I had the worst esperience ever.  When the Temecula location opened, I was skeptical of going because I might have the same experience again.  However, the staff at the reception area, the sales team, and to the signing of the papers, they all proved to me that I was wrong and that they are different from the other Fletcher Jones MB dealers.  They showed me an exemplar experience.  Anthony Chandler, the General Manager, showed up and introduced himself professionally - I did not experience this in the Newport location.  Mr. Chandler was being personal yet professional is  an indication that he handles his dealership well.  The staff in the Sales Department are not arrogant.  (It is unfortunate that a sales staff in the Newport location who showed me the GLK and ML is a snotty person.)

Enzo Impagliazzo and Vincent Troncoso in the Sales Department kept their promised that I will be bringing home the new car of my dreams.  Enzo did not only showed professionalism but also, allowed me to experience that I am taken cared of properly.  There are so many sales consultants who just wants to sell but not listening and understanding the things that a buyer is looking for in car.  Once I see that guy, the more that I stay away from that dealership.  Enzo is the type of sales consultant that I am looking for.  He is not pushy; he listens from the very start the list of things that I am looking for in a car.  He really knows how to take care of the buyer.

The number one reason why buyers is hesitant to go to a dealer is, it takes a lot of their time in the dealer.  Vincent Troncoso inspectably presented the numbers in less than 30 minutes. How can you beat that?!

The best marketing tool is a word of mouth. With what I experienced in Fletcher Jones Mercedes-Benz of Temecula, I will definitely recommend this dealership to friends, relatives, and most especially to my husband - the new MB guy (and no longer a BMW guy.)<//Review>
