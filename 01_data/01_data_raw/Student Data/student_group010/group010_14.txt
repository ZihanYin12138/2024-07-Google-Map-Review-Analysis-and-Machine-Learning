Big place lots of storage units, reasonably priced for location. Lots of homeless use it and sometimes hang out at their unit. Just painted exterior and interior but elevators are said to be cleaned up next. Needs more carts for its size as people have to wait on the few they have< /Review>

The staff was very nice and helped make the process easy. They even gave useful advice like taking pics of your stuff in case you have to make a claim. The facility was clean and easy access. Parking is a little tight so bigger trucks will probably take up two spaces.<//text>

Terrible customer service and policies. I rented a unit and never used it. That’s fine that I was charged for those months because I had it reserved. Then when I cancelled online they charged me for the entire month starting the day after I cancelled. When I called and asked for a refund April the manager refused when I told her I’d be disputing the charge w AMEX she threatened to send me to collections. I will be filing a formal complaint with the better business bureau and the California department of consumer affairs. If you have a similar experience I’d recommend the same.<//Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>It is Friday and according to the website they close at 6pm. I was just chased out by a very rude staff member at 5:43pm saying that are closed. I got an item on my dolly and just about to go up, she expects me to take it back to my car and leave. I was able to complete that item under her watchful eyes with rude attitude but had to take the other item home. Earlier that day there were no dolly to borrow, a simple one trip took 4 trips due to no dolly available. Not recommended, Stay away!</review>< Pics>

This is the worst public storage facility I have ever seen or used.  No offense to anyone but I dont want to fight a gang of homeless people who camp daily on the sidewalks around this facility.  Then inside is a cast of horrors..people sleeping and cooking in their units.  I cant even let my kids out of sight at this place because of the dangers.<//Review>

Awesome Experience at this location.  Amanda was prompt to initiate the 1st call, and was super nice, helping me get a unit on a last minute request. Upon arrival, she was friendly, smiley, and professional. Within 30 minutes i was in and out. Plus they give you 30 days free when u sign up online!
So overall she gets 5 stars from me!< /review>

<Review>I rented space here for my office while we were waiting for our new office to be built out by the landlord. I checked in with Amanda, who made the process very easy. No fluff, no long wait times, no extra nonsense. She was friendly and got me checked in quickly. I am very happy.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I rented a storage unit this past weekend and worked with Mike. He was very professional, courteous and provided the best customer service I have received in many years. My move from LA was a nightmare due to a Budget Truck rental breaking down which had to be towed to the storage facility. Mike worked with the tow truck drivers to gain access to additional parking spaces, checked on my moving team as we were unloading, and continued to offer as much support as possible. I highly recommend Public Storage but Mike is one of my new heroes!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

When I first moved my things into storage, I was a little worried that people off the streets were able to randomly get in. There was a smell of urine and feces in the stairwells. Now, things look nice and clean, it no longer smells of a bad public bathroom in the stairwells, and the actual bathrooms are decent. My storage space is ample and the price is reasonable.</review><Response>None</Response><pictures>None</pictures><time>1568814898829<//time>< username>

This public storage location is fantastic. Great location downtown and even better employees. Don’t be dismayed about the unfortunate folks living outside across the street. There is a homeless population nearby by the security and quality of the building are great. Emily and Raquel will help you with the check in process, show you around the property personally and answer nay questions you have.<//Review>

This is the worst storage in all of San Diego by far the staff are condecending and confrontational at every step of the way not only do they treat people with no respect they also cheap you out of your money. They are kicking me out of the storage on the 15th of march even though I paid for the full moth until the first. This is a scam they think they can treat people however they like. This is unacceptable.</review>

<text>This public storage has the most amazing customer service. Ana and Raquel has set up my storage and has made it so easy for me. The staff has left the doors open just a little longer to while I have been late. Every other storage location has been angry and aggressive if I come 30 minutes before close of business. They truly have great people here. 2 thumbs up!!<//text>< Pictures>

The Downtown staff are great; very knowledgeable and friendly. Both Emily and Raquel assisted me in choosing the unit size that would be best for me. They actually took the time to help me get everything figured out and all squared away. Definitely felt like more than just another number and they answered every question I had. Moving into the unit was a smooth process, which was a nice change of pace from my hectic home move. The unit was a great size and easily accessible. The building and property are very secure; gives me piece of mind. I appreciate the great service and thanks for a good experience!< /text>

EVERYONE NEEDS TO READ THIS REVIEW! Worst customer service ever! My mother rented a storage here and she accidentally locked her keys (along with her purse) in the U-Haul. She called the U-Haul and they stated they would be there in 15 minutes. The 2 ladies there were very rude and demanded my mom leave the property because they were closing . She begged them crying for them to please wait for them to come open the truck. They stated they didn’t care and she had to leave the property. Since she decided to wait for the U-Haul to send them, they proceeded to lock themselves in their office and sound the alarm so the cops would come and escort her off the property. When they arrived to open the truck the ladies refused to open the gates for the guy and demanded my mom leave the property. Never once were we rude but they were unprofessional and rude since the day I rented the unit. All that was unnecessary.<//Text>

It was a bit warm while moving my items, so make sure that movers are dressed lightly. The 5' x 10' space has ample space for those that are moving with not a lot of things. The person helping me check into the storage unit, Ana, was friendly and helpful, walking me through checking on the unit, asking after if I had forgotten anything to make storing my stuff better. It was a pleasant experience after being on the road for so long (drove from Washington State to San Diego, CA for school and this was my first stop).<//Text>

<Review>These guys are a rip off. I went in there with my closest girl friend to rent out a storage space rental and the damn front desk employees required me to pay them with a credit card. I told them I don't wanna use plastic but Cash but they refused and told me that in order for me to rent out a storage space I must pay the first month with my credit  card. Then they argued second month with cash if you wish. Sounds like a scam to me. Don't go there. Thank you</Review>< user_name>

The other day my friends and I were moving in and the staff was extremely helpful. I called in the morning before coming to check out the place and Raquel was great with answering our questions. Once we arrived Evelyn stoped cleaning to show us around and give us more info! It was nice & well staffed, we highly recommend this location.<//Text>

Fantastic location! Easy to access, and a variety of spaces to fit anybody's needs!

I moved into a smaller unit from my former apartment, and needed somewhere to store all my excess junk. Kareem and David really helped me find a space that suited my needs (5x10), and were simply the kindest and most attentive employees to deal with!

It helps that the storage space is incredibly affordable, too!</review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>Positive review first to the district manager and Ms. Evelyn who helped me after an incredibly frustrating interaction with Emily. Emily had a difficult time acknowledging the fact that she lacked communicating with me about their lock cutting policy when I experienced a family emergency out of town. Due to this interaction and her lack of empathy, I'll be leaving public storage this month after a 2 years of  loyalty. I'm appreciative of the district manager for listening to my concerns after the fact, I however feel the damage is done. Thank you Evelyn for treating me with kindness and respect.</text><username>Stephanie O< /username></record></dataset><record>

I want to thank Public Storage for letting me store my stuff in there storage units for 3 months, i had no problems with none my stuff. Ive seen comments where customers complain with all the homeless but they are literally no problem there very harmless and there just doing there thing.  Special Thanks to Jazmin for an amazing customer service and making my move in as easy as possible as she said it through the phone when i first made my reservation and also a special thanks to Chris and Raquel for helping me out as well. Will be recommending to friends and family. Sincerely Miguel R.</Review>

<review>Such great customer service!
Audrey and David were so helpful helping me pick out my storage unit.
I was indecisive at which unit I should get and they were very knowledgeable and patient as well.
I worked in customer service for about 4 years and I know that the needs of my customer come first and they did a great job doing so! Representing Public Storage very well!!<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I was helping a good friend of mine move her things into a storage this past saturday and at first she was really uneasy with the homeless in the area but it turned out to be a great experience the staff were very helpful and informative. Latoya did an awesome job assuring my friend the property was a safe and professional location. The other girls were very polite and helpful with our move. I had to write a review due to such a sweet group of women.. You hardly find great customer service like that anymore. Especially being done in a decent amount of time was a plus!!!

I have the greatest time taking with the staff here! David, Emily and Gabe treat you like family and make coming here worth it. The facility is clean, and the locals are more entertaining than a soap opera.< /review>

<review>This is the best place to rent in downtown San Diego.  Secured and there is parking.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  Victoria was awesome, if you rent from here you will be lucky to have her assist you.  I'm always thankful when a business is run well by a quality staff.< /review>< pictures>

I was greeted with a smile and treated professionally.  After describing the promotion of $1.00 for the first month and explaining in detail how the system works, it's hours etc. Jared showed me the unit I would be renting.
I was extremely impressed with Jared, he was very knowledgeable, professional yet friendly.  He did not rush me along the signing process, but instead made sure I understood everything.
Even after all was done, he could see I needed help on getting to a specific freeway, he came out of the office and showed me exactly where to go.
First time using Public Storage and I'm impressed.< /text>

<review>they are thieves. I am taking a legal action against, which should have been done many years ago so we could have avoided so many victims that suffered by now including me who was robbed and just like many of you wrote in the reviews, there was absolutely no surprise or shock by their employees when they discovered all my stuff was gone, the girl acted like this is normal everyday thing for them and now reading that so many of you felt the same, it really makes me wonder who really robs these lockers and btw checkout locker scams, huge scandals all over google how storage employees themselves rob their own customers.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Staff there are always polite. They explain everything on the paperwork,  and every time you walk in the office, they always greet you with a smile and friendly hello. It seems they WANT to be there as opposed to just being there for a paycheck.
Units are clean and secured. Unit was shown to us before renting, so we could know the unit we were getting.
All in all, a great experience and highly recommend this storage.<//review>

This facility is super nice, and the young man, Jared, was very helpful. He explained everything smoothly and easy for us to understand. Great monthly price for the "5x10" space we're renting. I, highly, recommend this facility.</Review>

<user_name>Darrick Moreno<//user_name><Date>1470847159316< /Date><rating>3</rating><review>Though the staff is great, seriously, the drum circle of homeless people that surrounds the place is a great deterrent from renting again here. The place is kinda dirty based on the amount of people that come in and out. Trash bins are locked so extra trips to a dumpster outside the place is not cool. Though they tell you the two on site are not for customers and outline it in the contract. Dimly lit hallways, the smell of urine, the human feces found in my unit was a pure joy. If San Diego city could help these guys out with moving the homeless, it could be a safe beautiful place. Sorry guys, my opinion.< /review>< Pics>

<rate>3</rate><Resp>None< /Resp><text>When we moved in, one of the elevators broke down, which made moving in very slow, as everyone was using the remaining elevator. When we moved out, the bathroom was closed for renovation, which meant I had to drive the moving truck to a nearby bathroom. It seems that they could have picked a better time, than the last Saturday of September to do a bathroom reno. Maybe middle of the month/middle of the week??
Also about 3 months after moving my recently homeless/jobless friend in, they raised the prices abour $20/month, which isn't a lot for me, but is a lot when you're living on $800/month disability check.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<text>The staff here was very friendly and helpful. This was my first time using a storage unit and they answered all of my questions and helped me every step of the way. I rented the unit in June and just moved out yesterday so having come full circle I can safely the whole experience was convenient and easy. Some of the things I liked:
Big parking lot which is gated
Great office hours
Flat carts like the ones from Ikea to help move your items in/out of unit.
Video surveillance everywhere (i felt safe at the property and in the building)
Really helpful staff<//text>< pics>

Bad management (no repairs to property, doors don't lock)
Bad pricing (raised my rent from $150/month to $300/month in 2 years)

OK staff (used to really like their staff. they made an error and charged me $50 late fee. wouldn't reverse it probably because management is greedy and won't let them).

Highly recommend you choose another location unless you live very close.</Text>< pictures>

The location is near a homeless mecca of some sort (no fault of the company) but secure.  I did manage to stump the team by asking about clause 15.f. of the rental contract "Time is of the essence." which confused all of us as to why that particular clause with no additional words is in there (i.e. that's all that paragraph says... but why?).  Although it is a true statement.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>I have used public storage in the past but this location is the best ive used. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I dealt with Raquel and Evelyn who were both super friendly and energetic. I reserved my storage unit online and within a hour I was able to start moving things in. I would reccomend this location because of the convienit location and the security measures in place (code required at gate and must use code to ride elevator to your floor.)< /text>< userid>

Cinnamon and Latoya took great care of us. Great staff and very friendly. Subject matter experts. Loyal devotion to service unrivaled in the San Diego area. Undaunting courage in the face of troublesome customers and upheld the highest traditions of the public storage service and reflected great credit upon the 16th Street Public Storage office.<//Review>

<text>Where to start off... Homeless people, urine smell everywhere, MICE INFESTATION, the gate and elevator doesn't work for sh** (absolutely frustrating), etc.
-You get what you pay for, an expect prices to jump 10-25$ whenever they want, without any notice.

AsIi stated earlier there are homeless people are everywhere.  They are people too and entitled to their units if they are paying but prepare to see these customers without full clothing and be just plain rude to you.

Last month my rent jumped 15$ without any notice, i am military and was deployed out the country for a month apparently they mailed a notice (never received).  Called and spoke to them to see if i could get a break or PARTIAL refund.  So then I was referred to the district manager MR.BERG had a convo with him he said he could not adjust only 1800 customer service could.  Then 1800 customer service said no they could not it could only be him, no body in this company is on the same page it seems.

While on the phone w MR.BERG, I explained I didn't think this facility was worth it especially after price increase.  He then explained that this facility was actually safer because homeless population is so great.....  I also brought up how the elevators and gate don't even work 100% of the time, like what are you using the money for this facility?  His answer was safety because of area.  I have used other Public Storage locations and this is by far the worst.  I moved out the following weekend and it smelled HORRIBLE another customer was nice enough to inform me of the mice problem, sure enough DEAD MICE IN MY UNIT AND HALLWAY!  No thanks, this place needs some serious help.< /text>< Time>

< Review>
I love dearly public storage in San Diego. it's a very decent , safe and secure place for  your property. They take very good care of your property . They treat every client and guest with  respect and courtesy. Regardless of our background, I have witnessed multiple times how they have handled situations graciously with very difficult  and demanding customers  who are suffering with some mental health issues , we may see them as homeless,  but they do have a storage unit and they enjoy  courtesy and respect from the entire staff members from public storage as their valuable customer. I think because of its location it is the only hope for a lot of underserved community members  to use this public storage as a refuge for their valuables and only that is very impressive as its self.  It is definitely boosting their morale and give them a sense of safety for their property. To me, to see that it's not only a sign of respect but also very Noble and God knows I know what respect is- I'm a veteran and a Wounded Warrior, served our country for 9 years and I understand a lot of situations and backgrounds . I'm very impressed by the entire staff of Public Storage San Diego,  especially the manager Christopher and his team  Dana , Jazmin and all others . I would recommend and invite everybody to come and enjoy this safe storage unit and have peace of mind that your property is safe and being watched 24/7.
Once I left my lock unlocked and when  Christopher made his hourly rounds and check my door to discover it , he immediately callled me and informed about it and requested  to come over and lock it because they couldn't put another lock on it. They periodically check on it until  i drove back. They already made 3 trips to my storage to make sure it stayed safe. Now that is a sense of Duty and responsibility! This is what I expect from a decent storage place, nothing can beat that.
This care is not specially catered to me because I'm a wounded warrior or a military person but they treat  everybody the same way . They treat every  client  equally and that is what we need-equality in our country to prosper with dignity   .

Respects and regards.

<Review>Great Staff.. LaToya was so helpful and she always has a smile on her face!  I had to push out my reservation an extra week, and luckily they had another unit the same size available that I needed.  She helped me do the reservation over the phone while I was online and then followed up to make sure we were on schedule the day before I had scheduled to come in and sign the papers. A pleasure to work with someone who is happy with their job.  I just came from another storage company where I had my unit for many years and they just kept changing staff and seem to have an attitude.. But not PS on 16th.  If you need a storage unit, this is the place to come.. great prices too!  Thanks LaToya!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>I just want to write to you about the excellent service I receive from LaToya and Deaundra. They are the most professional and delightful customer service rep. I have encountered in a while, every time I come to the office to pay my bill, they make an excellent impression even in the very few minutes we speak. They were accommodating as well as helpful. I was so impressed that I asked for their business card, so I could write a complimentary letter. LaToya & Deaundra courtesy is immeasurable. They are an asset to your company.

A most appreciative customer< /review><user>110076314324826579651</user><username>Damean T<//username><Resp>None<//Resp><Pics>None<//Pics><date>1442159480622< /date></record></dataset><record>

I have rented a storage space for several years at this location.  The Office Personnel are the best anyone could ask for or hope to meet at any storage facility.  I would especially like your company to notice your employee LaToya at this location.  She has ALWAYS been EXTREMELY HELPFUL, CHEERFUL, COURTIOUS, and PROFESSIONAL, every time I have had the need to go to the office at this storage facility.  Whether I am paying a bill, have billing questions or have questions about needing another storage unit, LaToya has NEVER let me down.  If you ever move LaToya to another location, please inform me because I want to move my storage unit to that location also.  She is the BEST!  Do not lose her!  Your other employees and future Public Storage employees could learn from her.  She stands Head and Shoulders above the rest!  Sincerely, Joseph E. Anders #B356< /Review>

Staff is awesome! Pricing is very good! Operating Hours suck! Needs an evening shift till at least 9pm.. The building lacks in simple engineering. Example: For some reason the elevator door openings are nearly 4 inchis wider than the hall passages door ways throughout the building... Thefore a tenant can bring up items that will never fit through the door ways!!! Feather more, passage doorways could easily be widend 3-4 feet in some locations and for some reason this has not been addressed!! Public Storage, you have alwsome service with ok hours, with elementary simple  building issues that could be fixed easy. I'm sure you have the money to make the changes and simple fixes to your building.. Infact I'm sure your probably already awar of this issue... How could you not be with all the scared up doorway's? My only question is why have you not fixed the issue???</Review>

<text>This is a tucked away step back into time. Have some delicious wine and chill out. They have some cool unique items in their store. The owner is so nice and welcoming, while wild peacocks walk around.</text>< pictures>

Great wine tasting room with rustic feel. Good selection of fines for tasting. The owner was very accommodating telling us a local celebrity stories and some special "medicine" tasting. Tasting was $10 per person and one cheese plate for $15. Welcoming atmosphere with the seating on outdoor patios. Definitely would recommend for a quick stop<//Review>

The staff are super attentive and friendly and made the experience quite wonderful. I did the wine tasting and they tag teamed telling us about the different wines. When asked if we could have water, they never let our glasses go empty. Would highly recommend this place, a fun gem close to the city and if you choose the right route can get a really fun drive to get to and from</Review>

< review>
They've really made a lot of enhancements to this beautiful place with some outdoor covered patio seating an a new nursery (plants, not babies). They might have the most artistic bathroom I've ever experienced. My friends were very pleased with the wines they tasted and I loved the handmade almond toffee. Love this hidden gem right next to the Old Place Restaurant.<//review>

<Text>We really liked this place. It was adorable and the service was great. They offer so many wines. You are able to choose six..but there many more. I agree with the other reviewers that the wines are on the fruity side. We ended up getting a bottle of blueberry and autumn harvest. Great way to spend an autumn day.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>An amazing lounge off the beaten track with a very large selection of Malibu and Southern California wines.

I can't say enough positive things about the Cornell room. Cozy boutique chic and hip with marvelous attentive hosts.

Outstanding.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>As someone who does a decent amount of wine tasting, I'm a bit embarrassed that I was completely unaware of this location until very recently and just visited for the first time yesterday!  It is important to say that the name is a bit misleading as this isn't a Winery at all, but a wine store.  That said, it is a glorious location that is a must-visit for any fan of wine!

The location is BEAUTIFUL!  It's literally in the woods of the Santa Monica Mountains in Malibu in a rustic building that looks like an old church.  Turns out that it was a storage facility built by the Runyon family (yes, the same family who donated the land for Runyon Canyon Park).  Regardless of the truth, it has the feel of a beautiful old church or building with some type of wondrous past.  It is beautiful and rustic inside.  This is a PERFECT place for a romantic date.  My only large complain about this place is that they close at 7pm!  It is SO beautiful here after dark and it's the type of place you'd love to hang out, relax and sip wine well into the evening.  Apparently they've run into some type of legal issues that makes them close at 7pm that they're working to fix, but it sounded like it wouldn't be resolved anytime soon.

Anyways, onto the wine!  We did a tasting of 4 wines and they were FANTASTIC!  I've done tasting up and down the Pacific coast, and rarely do you get such a high percentage of wins!  I'm much more of a big, bold reds guy... but they're Madam Preston Viognier Blend was really a delicious white and only $20 for the bottle.  The star of the evening though was The Malibu Vineyard Pinot Noir that I still can't get out of my mind.  From the first whiff I took I knew it was something special, and then the taste absolutely lived up.  It is so unique!!!  It is literally the best Pinot Noir I've ever had not made in Oregon, and this could stand right next to many Oregon Pinots.  While we're definitely budget wine drinkers in the sense that we LOVE wine and wine tasting, but can't afford to enjoy it as much as we'd like... we are rarely interested in wine clubs... but this wine was so good that it built an instant trust in their taste that I would seriously have considered joining their wine club. Alas... they don't have a wine club here.  Oh well.  However, since they don't have a wine club, their bottle prices are actually very reasonable. So it's a great place to buy bottles.

It should be noted that there is a $10 corkage fee here, which I think is kind of lame for a wine store who's trying to get you to buy their wine... however they give generous pours by the glass... so enjoy their wine by the glass and take home who you love.  Also... apparently it is legal to drink in National Parks... who knew???  That means the park right across the street you can drink in!  So you can buy a bottle and take it across the street and enjoy a picnic in the park!

This is also right next door to The Old Place Restaurant which looks amazing and smells even better (we walked in to check it out, but you need to make reservations many times three weeks out).  I can't wait to try it out!!!  Apparently they have a $20 corkage fee, but if you bring a bottle from Cornell, they reduce that to $10.

End verdict... I LOVE this place!!!  You HAVE to visit and make sure you try that 2012 Malibu Vineyard Pinot Noir!!!</Review>< Name>

The setting is really quite cozy and the rustic exterior and interior are inviting and warm. The wines we tasted were great with some good notes. However, we were a little disappointed with the cheese plate that looked like it was probably fresh a few days before our visit, and even more so with the corking fee for a bottle we bought there at the tasting room to share amongst ourselves with our cheese plate after paying for individual tasting flights. Overall, it was a positive experience and we hope our next visit is better.<//Review>< rating>

Great place to chill on the weekend! The wine selection is amazing and all with local wineries. The charcuterie and cheese board are really good too. Usually we start with the flight of wine and then grab a bottle. Ambiance is perfect 👌< /Text>

Liked the wines, and they provide a generous 3 samples. Food was pretty good, would agree with 3.5 for food. I liked the customer service, they were prompt, and very nice. It was Saturday for dinner so I thought it was going to take a long time given prior reviews. Would go again. We had pastrami sandwich, which my wife loved, and I had the shrimp linguini..which was good.</Review>

<Text>Unfortunately, my expectations were set a little too high and I expected better.

First and foremost, the wines that were recommended were just ok but nothing special. The staff never seemed asked the right questions to build the proper recommendations and felt very disengaged. The staff was nice but we needed the proper service and attention to detail we though Cornwell Winery would provide. I thought the venue itself was pretty nice with a great layout and plenty of friendly smiles. We added a large meat and cheese platter for our reservation which to accommodate our party. Unfortunately, it was very lackluster for our party size. Don't get me wrong it was good but I just could not explain to my friends and family how playing $12 per person for this platter was a good idea. Please note, the whole table is charge of the platter whether you eat or not and sadly my party could barely enjoy a nimble. Yes, will all eat lunch 2 hours prior so just a heads up.

Service was a little slow but that was expected for a busy Saturday afternoon. Sadly the staff seemed clueless on recommendations and was unable to even pronounce some of the names of the wines they were recommending. That was a little weird and laughable.

Also, just a friendly heads up. The cell service is poor in and around the establishment so you will need to walk around and search for signal to make or receive a call (I have Sprint and Verzion and a friend as Tmobile, all low to no signal).

All in all, the Cornell Winery is an cool winery, it's just not anything special and may not be worth the drive if you are coming from far away. BUT if you are local and like great ambience and descent wine I recommend stopping by. I did have a couple other hang ups but not worth mentioning.

Thank you for the experience,< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

OC Wills and Trust made the process very simple. Explained everything to us in detail and in terms we could easily understand (not lawyer speak). They took care of all the paperwork, answered all our questions without hesitation and were a pleasure to do business with. Highly recommend them if your in the need for a will/ trust.< /Text>

I must say that I was very happy working with Anthony Yang at the OC Wills and Trust firm.  He was very professional and explained all the details of the documents.  He also answered all my questions and I felt very comfortable with them.  It was very easy to setup the appointments and also any question I asked I would get a quick response back.

Thank you Anthony for the great job and keep up the good work.< /Review>

Talked to a few other attorneys before choosing OC. With the others the process seemed complicated and expensive. Brian explain the whole process in simple to understand terms. He had our trust completed in a week or so for about half what others wanted to charge.
That deserves 5 stars.< /Text>

<Review>I had an amazing experience with OC Wills and  Trust Attorneys. I looked for favorable reviews on Yelp and they were rated highly for their professionalism  etc. I was amazed that I was able to complete my will and irrevocable trust in two weeks with total confidence about the results. I have already recommended them to friends and would highly recommend them to anyone searching for an attorney who handles trusts and other related services.</Review><user_id>106735632255558708844</user_id>< gmap_id>

<text>We were extremely happy with the Estate Planning services we received via OC Wills and Trusts.  Brian Chew, Anthony and the whole team were professional, responsive and patient in guiding us through setting up a trust and wills.  We were intimidated by the perceived enormity of the project but OC Wills and Trusts were organized, thorough and very understandable, simplifying the process to two short online meetings and one in-office document signing visit.
We have recommended their services to friends and would highly recommend them to anyone to handle this vital yet often deferred service.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Working with Emily and Brian were such good experiences.  Introduction session was very informative. Lots of questions were answered. Concepts that I would have no idea about were introduced and explained to me clearly and relevant. These concepts became very basic, natural and important to know after the explanations. Process of setting up documents were smooth and clear despite large volume of papers and many signatures. Second section was productive. I like the follow-up emails also answering questions that I run into when building up the contents into the Trust.  Overall, it was a great experience.< /review>

I contacted multiple referrals for our Living Trust update from the retired attorney who created the original version 20+ years ago.  Brian and OC Wills responded immediately.  They were knowledgeable, friendly, professional, courteous, COVID-19 aware and reasonable.  Took less than two weeks to complete the entire process and we are very happy.< /Review>

<review>I used Brian Chew to set up a Trust for my parents. We made an appointmrnt and they were prompt and on time. They explained the whole process. At the end we walked out of their office with a notebook binder filled  with all my parents financial accounts in order and protected in a family trust. Super easy process. They go above and beyond to help people. Brian will also answer your phone calls if you have any questions. During or after this process.</review></record></dataset><record>

Brian is very approachable and ready to answer all your questions.
Brian and his team were only a phone call away and made the entire process of creating our Estate Plan simple, straight forward and hassle free. They took care of everything including notarizing the documents. We highly recommend Brian and OC Will & Trust Attorneys.< /Review>

Brian is very knowledgeable about trusts and what one should expect while setting up their trusts.  He thinks about all unforeseen issues and reviews them with you.  Emily is so patient and calm that you really don’t feel that you are talking with an attorney.  I highly recommend this law firm<//text>

Brian Chew and the entire firm were most accommodating and straightforward. They answered all of our questions and discussed the scenarios we were concerned about. In just a couple meetings we were able to establish our trust, and complete a will, durable power of attorney and advanced health care directive. I highly recommend them and have already referred several family/friends. Their experience has been equally successful.< /Text>

<text>We were co-trustees of an existing trust when we learned that trust did not protect the interests of the survivor trustee when the first one died. We asked OC Wills and Trust Attorneys to start from scratch to create a will that would protect the surviving trustee. They did an excellent, thorough job quickly and competently. We were impressed by their business-like but friendly approach. We recommend them without reservation.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1571700485739, 'text': 'Thank you Melinda!

We had too long delayed setting up our trust and other important protections.  Brian was very patient in guiding us through some of our challenges and understanding our needs.  He carefully listened my husbands concerns in particular and offered us options that we had not known were viable.  After just a couple of hours in preparation and a follow up office visit we came away with a binder and digital copies clearly spelling out our wishes from health care directives to asset protections.  Great service and I cannot say enough good things about our experience.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Brian and his staff are top notch! My company picked up the Hyatt Legal Plan at work and offers discounts for many Attorney services. Getting a Will & Trust has been on my mind for more than a year, so when the Legal Plan was implemented at work I started my search for a Trust Attorney. I read a lot of reviews on many attorneys and felt that Brian and his staff were getting a lot of positive comments and therefore decided on using their services. The process was explained and outlined very plainly to me. All my questions were answered, and the experience was much easier than I expected. Do not hesitate to use this Law Firm, you will not be disappointed!</Text>< pictures>

<text>We couldn't have been more delighted with the service provided by Brian and his team. My wife and I needed to update our Estate Plan and the attorney who initially prepared the Plan had retired, so based on recommendations such as this, we turned to OC Wills and Trusts for assistance.  We had retired to Mexico so we wanted all the prep work done ahead of time by email or telecom, so all we had to do was sign the documents when we visited the office.  The process went smoothly with Brian and his team collecting information, answering questions and providing suggestions/guidance as appropriate.  The updated documents were perfect when we arrived at the office for signing. We highly recommend OC Wills and Trust for your estate planning needs.< /text>< Pictures>

Me, Brian Chew and his assistant Anthony, were very professional and helpful.  I emailed a couple of changes to Mr. Chew and Anthony and they were addressed quickly and efficiently.  The finished will, living trust and other legal matters were presented in an organized portfolio with a good explanation of what to do next. His name was recommended by a friend and I will in turn recommend him to my friends and family.< /review>

Brian and his team were very cordial, professional, knowledgeable, patient and efficient.  Pricing was also very reasonable.  These are not the easiest topics to talk about, let alone execute on but it was a very painless process.

Estate Planning is one of those things in life that we don't necessarily look forward to completing and many, including myself put it off until later in life when we have families and assets.  If you want to help your loved ones to avoid extra costs and avoid probate court, it is something definitely worth considering.

Brian and his team make this experience much easier with his warm and helpful personality.  Brian has been practicing Estate Planning for years and his expertise and knowledge in this area is very reassuring.  He is thorough and can quickly analyze your portfolio and guide you through the process.  Brian is excellent at asking the right questions and providing his insight to assist you with some of the important financial and medical decisions in your will and trust. Brian's team is friendly, efficient and are excellent in communicating their progress.

Brian's Estate Planning prices are fair considering his expertise and piece of mind that his practice provides.  You might find someone for just a little less money, but be sure to give Brian a call before you make a final decision on something important as your Estate Planning.<//review>

I use this station to get around a lot and I really like the skylight that they have to give the whole place a natural light. The station is really straight forward and it's one of the few ones that doesn't smell bad. Sadly this station doesn't have a restroom available, but they do have a customer service area to help out with all kinds of needs. The employees I've interacted with here are all really nice and I hardly see homeless people at this station.

It's also right across the street from Laney College, a couple blocks from the Oakland Museum of California and a few blocks from Lake Merritt. It also has a park and Buddhist temple a block away. It's a convenient stop with a lot to offer and it's the one I use the most when I want to go somewhere.<//text>

Bay Area Rapid Transit widely known by the acronym “BART” is the main rail transportation system for the San Francisco Bay Area.

1900s, the idea of an underwater electric rail tube was first proposed by Francis "Borax" Smith.

Since 1911, visionaries had periodically brought up this Jules Verne concept.

In 1946, the “BART” story begins as a concept gradually evolving from informal gatherings of business and civic leaders on both sides of the San Francisco Bay.  People discussed ways of easing the mounting congestion that was clogging the bridges spanning the Bay.

In 1947, a joint Army-Navy review Board concluded that another connecting link between San Francisco and Oakland would be needed in the years ahead to prevent intolerable congestion on the Bay Bridge.

In the 1950s, the actual planning for a rapid transit system began.

In 1951, California's legislature created the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission to study the Bay Area's long-term transportation needs.

In 1957, forming of a transit district charged with the construction and operation of a high-speed rapid rail system linking the cities and suburbs, thus BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit District) was formed.

Between 1957 and 1962, engineering plans were developed for a system of electric trains that would run on grade-separated right-of-ways, reaching maximum speeds of 75-80 mph, averaging perhaps 45 mph, including station stops.  Advanced transit cars, with sophisticated suspensions, braking and propulsion systems, and luxurious interiors.

In November 1962, the BART plans were finally approved by the voters.

In 1962, the total cost of the system was projected at $996 million.  It would be the largest single public works project ever undertaken in the U.S. by the local citizenry.

On June 19, 1964, BART construction officially began with President Lyndon Johnson presiding over the ground-breaking ceremonies at the 4.4-mile test track between Concord and Walnut Creek in Contra Costa County.

In February, 1967, the 3.2-mile bore through the hard rock of the Berkeley Hills was completed after 466 work days, to become the fourth longest vehicular tunnel in the U.S.

On January 27, 1971, the final tunnel bore was "holed through" into the west end of the Montgomery Street Station and also marked the completion of tunneling work in the huge, two-level Market Street subway and climaxed six years of tunneling underground.

On September 11, 1972, BART began service and reported more than 100,000 passengers in its first five days.

•	In November 1977, Saturday trains started.

•	In July 1978, Sunday service started.

In the 1980s an extension to the San Francisco Airport was being planned.

The 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake severed the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge for a month and destroyed the Cypress Street Viaduct.

Our visit:
BART is a “love, hate, relationship.”  You love the system when it’s running on time, but hate it when it breaks down or in this case, the looming strike, which would cripple the commute by forcing hundreds of thousands of additional vehicles on the road!

I’ve ridden these trains on numerous occasions over the years, especially when it first came on line.  At first, the new trains were more of a novelty and pretty crowded with a lot of sight seers and tourists.

Over the years, the tourist aspect has diminished and the system settled into the commute mode of transporting thousands of Bay Area residents, myself included during those early years.

I no longer rely on the BART system, which for me is a good thing with the latest on going squabble and possible shutting down of the system on 17 Oct 2013 would be terrible for those depending on this form of transportation.

Overall, BART has reduced a lot of the vehicle traffic that we would typically have and has been of great service, “when it has operated!”<//Text>

A lot of people skip the gates at this station. I find *tons* of one-way tickets on the ground and in the station. (one way tickets are the minimum value only scanned in one direction)

This makes BART *a lot* more expensive for everyone else.

Otherwise, this station is clean, the people who work here are friendly, and I have seen no other issues.< /text>

Parking was a lot idk why the service lady told me on the phone that it will be fill by 6am so I had to arrived before six. But when the Lyft driver dropped me off there was so many open spaces. Service at the station was fairly ok. My destination was from lake Merritt to Powell st (SF)<//review>

<Text>In February, I lost my father unexpectedly and I had no clue where to begin to prepare a funeral. The Long Beach VA provided me with a booklet of mortuaries to call.  I called so many and it seemed like no one had capacity. I called McKenzie Mortuary and received a return call from the owner, Ken that eased my heart.

Ken was very kind and understanding. He understood my father was a Army Veteran who passed at the VA hospital and how important it was to have him receive a dignified service.  Ken sat down with me to create a wonderful Veterans package. He connected my family with Pastor Brown and the most amazing video creator Dave. Dave's slide show of my dad's life was AMAZING and it made my family remember all the good times with dad and cry tears of joy.

I am thankful for the wonderful staff at McKenzie's mortuary. And for Ken taking time to return my call and allowing my father to have the most beautiful funeral services. Thank you.<//Text>< Resp>

<review>I lost my 42 year old husband to COVID in January. Everything happened quickly and it was extremely traumatic. During this time, McKenzie Mortuary Services took care of every detail with kindness and care. Kenneth and his staff are warm and professional. During the hardest moment of my life, McKenzie treated me like family. I cannot thank them enough.</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Ken,

Our Family joins me in thanks to you and your staff at McKenzie Mortuary for the extraordinary thoughtful, personal and professional services rendered to us as you handled the Memorial and Determent Services for our Beloved Husband, Dad and Granddad.  You remembered the little things that could have easily been forgotten or overlooked by our Family.  You handled them with sincere compassion.  We will confidentially recommend McKenzie should the opportunity arise in our sphere of contacts in the future.

With gratitude,
Pearlie< /Review>

My family and i used McKenzie's services for my father's funeral back in the beginning of the month of May. They were truly helpful in all aspects of the arrangements that were needed to be made. They made the transition very easy and stress free when having to coordinate my fathers funeral. We were truly grateful for what they did for my family & my father. Bonnie was an absolute angel and we are truly grateful for her & her support. I would definitely recommend using the services that they provide. Thank you guys so much from the Alvarez-Ruiz family.<//text>

Not knowing I needed to have made prior arrangements, I found myself in a panic on Easter Sunday when my mother passed away. Despite it being a holiday evening, I was put in direct contact with Derrick of McKenzie Mortuary rather than a recording or an answering service. Derrick was kind, patient, and far from pushy while explaining the necessary steps to proceed. The entire process was eased by the professional and compassionate staff who were always responsive to my phone calls. Weeks after the arrangements were settled, McKenzie staff even checked in on my well being.
In summary, McKenzie Mortuary was efficient, professional, and compassionate. I would not hesitate to recommend or use them again in the future.< /Text>

<Text>McKenzie has assisted with many passings within my family. My husband, my son, my aunt, my uncle. Every time they have been considerate and understanding of my pain. It’s hard enough dealing with family death, then to deal with arrangements is difficult at best. McKenzie will get you through it efficiently, effectively and as economically as possible. I highly recommend them.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

The staff at McKenzie Mortuary was very helpful and supportive in my time of need. I explained to them what I wanted and there was no effort to sell things I didn't want.  Afterwards, they have followed up with calls to check on how I was doing and offered grief support information to help in dealing with the loss.  I feel comfortable in recommending McKenzie to others who have lost a loved one or are planning ahead.< /text>

<Name>Shari Albrecht< /Name><review>Due to the outstanding service my family received as family members (aunt, mom, dad) passed this past January I was devastated.. My 32 year old son passed away from Covid-19 I called McKenzie Mortuary.  Kenneth and his staff were so compassionate at a time when the pandemic was stretching mortuaries throughout Southern California. They put their personal needs aside to focus on my needs in dealing with the death of my son. They were patient with me when necessary and kept me informed about his cremation and once his cremains were ready to come home. They attended to every request & detail I had.

If that wasn't enough on my sons birthday I received the most thoughtful message from McKenzie Mortuary regarding my son.

I can not say enough wonderful things about McKenzie Mortuary! I highly recommend them.</review><Date>1621715395889< /Date>< response>

< Review>
I recently asked my friends from McKenzie Mortuary to help our family prepare for my mom's funeral. I feel like I can call them my friends because we've used their services twice before, once for my dad and once for my brother and they've always done an exceptional job.

Derrick King, the Director, explained everything to us so there was never any doubt about what to expect. He made sure all options were presented and took his time so that there was never any misunderstanding.

Because my dad was a veteran, my mom and dad were both buried together in April 2021 at the Riverside National Cemetery . Derrick made sure that this took place and I know this took a little more work on his part.

We were able to witness the flag ceremony and the 21 gun salute which made it a very special day for all of us.

Again, McKenzie Mortuary, thank you for helping us during this very difficult time and for recently contacting us to see how we were doing.<//Review>

McKenzie has helped our family with the last 4 deaths we have suffered. We have come back to them for their sensitivity and lack of pressure during a time when you are most vulnerable. I am pleased to be able to highly recommend them.< /review>

Ken and everyone at McKenzie were wonderful when we were going through an incredibly stressful time.  He handled everything during the period when Covid was causing massive delays. We never felt rushed, and he explained the process clearly—our family felt very secure with McKenzie taking care of our loved one.</text>

I entrusted McKenzie mortuary with my grandmother’s homegoing celebration and they did an awesome job. From making conducting all the administrative needs to caring for he remains to all the other arrangements, each one on their team was professional and welcoming. They are an asset to the Long Beach community and I am thankful that they were there for my family and I.<//text>

I lost my husband on March 6th, 2021. I had never been to a funeral home. On top of that, the day I went to McKenzie, it was my birthday. To my surprise, I was so comforted by their caring nature. Kenneth especially was superp in his kind words and fast service. I actually left the mortuary with a smile, knowing that my husband would be laid to rest with great care. My husband deserved the best and we were fortunate to find McKenzie Mortuary.
Thank you.< /text>

<review>10/10 service, came here a couple months ago when my mother passed away and Kenneth made my experience absolutely wonderful. He made us laugh, cry, and smile in our time of need and was very kind and through when talking about the arrangements. The cremation process was fairly quick, took about a month to get my mother but wouldn’t want to have it any other way. Kenneth also told us about the prices and didn’t try to upsale us. After everything was over they even contacted me asking if I was okay and if I needed anything. Very kind and pleasant people and would definitely come here again if I needed the service. Thank you guys ❤️< /review>< userid>

Ken & his entire staff were amazing though this tragic, heart wrenching experience.  We first requested a simple viewing and then changed to a service, which they were able to accommodate within 16 hours, even with a Zoom component.  The care, empathy, and flexibility they provided was incredible during the hardest time of our life.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who is in the horrible place of needing this service.  They were a light during a very dark time.< /Review><userid>116630249778303615871< /userid>< resp>

<text>This mortuary has handled both of my grandmothers’ remains. When my maternal grandmother passed, there was no plan in place. My mom was no longer alive so it was my responsibility to figure it out. They could not have been kinder or more patient. With the loss of my dad’s mom this last February during the pandemic, my dad called many places, and none were prepared to accommodate us. I told him I was sure that Mackenzie could help him. Sure enough Ken, the owner, personally supported my family during a stressful time. We received follow up calls and first class service.<//text>< pics>

My step father passed away of COVID-19. I called numerous Mortuary's to make arrangements and all were completely booked. When I called McKenzie, I was transferred directly to Kenneth McKenzie. He was kind and understanding, and although experiencing a drastic increase in requests due to COVID-19, he went above and beyond to accommodate me. In addition, the costs were reasonable which was a pleasant surprise during this difficult time. My family and I are truly grateful for the outstanding service.  McKenzie will the first mortuary I call in the future when the need arises. Thank you Kenneth and team.  Truly appreciative.<//review>

Ken McKenzie has been an absolute Godsent to our family. He has helped us survive our most difficult times in our lives. He recently once again helped us with our heartbreaking loss of my sister to Covid.
He was compassionate, reasonable, overwhelmingly helpful and so loving, we felt like we were being taken care of by family.
We will always be thankful for you and your staff for all your help and kindness.</review>

<Text>I wish I could give them 10 stars.
At the time of my father's passing another funeral home was available to pick him up. The other funeral home was not a good match for my family I reached out to Mc Kenzie's Mortuary  and the director took care of everything for me. They went and picked up my father from the other mortuary,  they treated him with kindness and respect. They returned phone calls in a timely manner. And they absolutely affordable.
No one tries to upsell you on any of their services they listen to your wants and needs and they deliver I cannot say enough good about the director and his staff.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<text>First, I am truly sorry you need to read this review, my condolences.

When I needed help as my mom was placed on hospice care due to cancer, I could not find anyone.  I called several places but due to Covid, everyone was full and over capacity.  I called McKenzie on recommendation of a social worker.  He listened and was compassionate.  He took the bare minimum of information from me then told me to do something important.  I thought he was going to ask for a deposit or payment.  He told me to go take care of my family.  He understood the gravity of the moment and had compassion upon me.

As my mom passed, they came with dignity and respect for her and took care of her.  I spoke to Ken as we finished arrangements in person and told him about not getting a flag for my father who recently passed.  My dad was a veteran and my sister got his flag upon my mom's passing.   Ken told me to show him the paperwork and he got me a flag.  He did it.  It was folded in the proper fashion and he handed it to me.  As a veteran myself, the flag has special meaning to us both.  I shed tears that were held back for over 3 years.

They continue to txt every npw and then to ask how I am doing and if there is any assistance they can provided even a few months later.

I highly recommend McKenzie Mortuary services  for their service, their compassion and above and beyond "humaness".  Thank you to the entire team.<//text><Response>{'time': 1623280855405, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words and review.

<name>Dawn Faessler< /name><review>Sadly my mother passed away at the end of last year on NYE.  It happened very suddenly and it was hard to find a mortuary to get her before midnight on NYE.  McKenzie Mortuary Services to the rescue. They were able to get my mom before another scheduled pickup which was a blessing given our circumstances.
From Night 1, Ken (the owner), had been super thoughtful, caring, respectful, and an all around great person.  He met with us personally to go over all of the arrangements. We were prepared to bargain prices and had a good laugh about a Golden Girls episode in the lobby before our meeting. The McKenzie prices were very affordable. I honestly expected to pay 2-3xs more based on our experience at All Souls for my grandma in 2019.  We were pleased and agreed to everything. Ken made the entire experience easier given the nature of his business.  You can tell that he truly cares and has been pulling long days since the Covid peak.
Because of Covid we had strict rules to follow for the amount of people allowed at any given time during the viewing.  Ken’s people helped with everything along the way. My SIL provided photos and songs and their media person put together a great slideshow. They also filmed live and provided a Zoom link so friends and family could watch the mass service from home. All of our friends and family said the Zoom service was done well. They had different camera angles and the sound quality was really good- especially when my niece sang. The entire viewing process went smoothly and it seemed like fate that our mom ended up here. We couldn’t have been more pleased with how things turned out and how well everything went given how much busier Ken and his team have gotten.<//review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Words simply cannot express how appreciative I am of Ken McKenzie and his staff. My father passed away while at sea on a cruise. He left and returned port in California and he was from Texas. My Aunt contacted Ken as she had used him previously. Ken could not have been more gracious to help our family in our unique set of circumstances. He and his staff went above and beyond. They were not the funeral home who was going to be doing the services, as I had one in Texas lined-up. Ken and his staff did every single thing they could to make sure that my father was not only taken care of appropriately, but they had everything lined-up so that as soon as my father returned to port he was returned home immediately. There were a lot of things that had to be done just right and put into place in order not to delay things. They are experienced, work hard for the family, and they did all of that while bringing an enormous comfort to us. I knew they had the best of intentions for my father. They were in constant contact with me every step of the way. Ken had the answers to every question that I didn't know yet I would have. Ken and his staff could not have been better. I am 100% convinced that I would not have received the same service and compassion from anyone else – and likely never again. I highly recommend McKenzie Mortuary Services.</text>< pictures>

We lost our youngest son on July 18, 2018.  With our minds trying to understand this sudden loss, we were numb with the thought of having to bury him or even deal with all of the planning process.    McKenzie Mortuary  was referred to us by a close family friend who had previously used their services.  Ken and his staff were so kind and understanding and helped take care of everything we needed.  From the moment we first entered their doors they made us feel comfortable and completely confident that our beloved Wesley would be taken care of with love and kindness.  They made this very painful process go smoothly and they were always available for anything we needed.  I would highly recommend McKenzie Mortuary to anyone and have since given their information to several people.</Text>

<review>No stars is what is deserved. The older woman in charge is rude and impatient during the services. Makes rude remarks and is rude about how she dismisses you.The room is stuffy and small, no ventilation inside chapel. If you have a loved one that was loved by many this is definitely not the place for the services. In fact, don’t use this place at all, theyre unprofessional and have no sympathy for the emotions going around. Don’t let them disrespect your loved one like that, they deserve better.<//review></record>

<text>My sister just passed and they are the only ones that offered viewing and creation with urn for Tamar my sister so we can say goodbye our way to her. Accidental death is hard for a family.
After going to more than one place finding a place to offer everything else we need us a blessing.< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< Name>

< Review>
Don't waste your money here! Everything is highly overpriced, staff SUCKS, and they messed several things up for my father in law's service. We paid for a cremation package and they didn't even start the cremation until the night before his service!!  Even though we had his body released to them a WEEK before hand! They almost didn't have it done because apparently the staff didn't have the correct paperwork filled out, so they called us the DAY BEFORE his service saying they didn't have the correct documents to follow thru with his cremation! We were all so stressed out about it! We are not even sure how they ended up getting it done!?! Is it really my father in laws ashes in the urn?? Then, during the service, they had to keep changing the microphone batteries WHILE PEOPLE WERE TALKING. There was NO ONE helping us out during the service to make sure things went smoothly, my husband had to do all of that ON HIS OWN while also trying to mourn his father at the same time. UNBELIEVABLE!  Then, the music that my brother in law worked hard to put together DIDN'T EVEN PLAY during the picture slide show when it was supposed to.  The Priest we paid for that they hired was a bit weird & kept getting his facts wrong about my father in law! (So embarrassing!), AND the place was just too damn small and HOT!!!  Too many things went wrong with these people and my family really deserves some of their money back for all of this!!<//Review>

<name>Christine Monton< /name><review>If there was a Zero Star option, that would have been the rating that i gave them.

Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with their services. It has been almost a month in 5 days yet can't get the remains of a loved one. Then when you call the place, they keep saying they will return the call because they are busy. Where's the compassion in that? It's sad that we already lost a loved one and even more sad that i can't seem to get an answer about the remains!</review><resp>None<//resp>< user>

Ken said he'd be at the services , never showed his face, told our family he'll have a brand new bronze casket, it was chipped and denyed and it was rose color for a male. Promised a limo which made family late to mass because driver was sick.  Poor quality of service sure took the cash payment with a smile. Do not recommend.</Review>

It's a nice place, it felt and looked clean, with beautiful decor, enough outdoor seating. The service was great and so was the food. After lunch we had some good coffee and they served it in the cutest mugs. I will be definitely coming back and try more dishes!<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Best Mexican food in Modesto. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars  is because  almost every time I go there and get an order to go., When I get home  something is missing. I usually order a lot of food to take out  and its  pretty hard to take everything out of the bag and check it.  I guess ill have to start doing that tho. Got home last week and my refried beans wasn't in the bag.  tonight   i asked for extra salsa   got home   No extra salsa  But they gave me extra jalapenos.  Nice people tho. Very friendly service. They just seem to keep forgetting what I ordered.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x809055bf6f44c671:0xf655b3a073f3598f< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They overcharged for 49 dollars and I tipped. I called back to talk to a manager and I got the waitress. She explained that because I don't have a receipt they can't look up my information. This is a lie. You have to keep records for tax purposes. She said she would give me the owner's number. She waited 3 minutes and said she couldn't find it. Then 5 minutes later she told me she can't give out the owner's number. She told me to come down and show my receipts. How can I show receipts for something I didn't purchase? They charged my card without me knowing and refuse to give it back.  The waitress told me you can come down here and see the owner but he is never here. Save your receipts because this place will rip you off.< /Review><rating>1< /rating><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

The service was ok, we had steak fajitas for 2, price on menu was $26 we were charged $29 told was because of higher meat prices.  No effort to let us know ahead of time.  The vegies were cooked to perfection, the steak was a little tuff.  The fly population was a little out of hand but we expected some not quite so many.  An A+ for making the place look nice.< /Text>

The Enchiladas Mexicanas that the wonderful server recommended was unique and one of the most delicious meals I’ve ever had - from any restaurant. What a pleasant surprise - highly recommended.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQNu5Z0qz8tiqDTpZe06UhJPar-Eh6YkKSGDt6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3OIf0KWT-rdzwEeBbqz46PXz4yQjvUFtOtYq0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

It's good but could be better.  Flavor was good.  Service was great.  Salsa was weak... and chips tasted stale.< /Text>

I ordered the shrimp enchiladas, it was supposed to come with red sauce choice of meat, topped with lettuce, crema, cotija cheese, onion, avocado, and tomatoes. The two ordes that I got came with only the tortilla, red sauce and diced plain shrimp nothing else.<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Food is delicious. Everything is very well served and very well presented. You can see in every detail the love that the owners have given their business. The site is very beautiful. Nicely decorated. The music was just right and very good indeed. I recommend it 100% and from now on I am a client of El Maguey. I went with my wife and kids and we all loved it. The margaritas are delicious too. Thanks.

< Review>
Can't give Starbucks more than four stars because it is just to expensive. Five dollars for a cup of coffee is just to much. It is however excellent coffee. Service here is fast and I can't remember ever having a bad experience at this location. You should defienitly use the mobile app, they will have it ready for you when you come in. No waiting in line, quite convenient.< /Review>

I ordered using the mobile app as we were pulling into the lot looking for parking. By the time my daughter and I had used the restroom our drinks were done. These are the best espresso drinks we’ve had since being in California, we are so happy with this place!<//review>

Not much of a Starbuck-er. I don’t drink coffee and try to avoid sugary treats (although I have had some from a Starbucks and  they are delicious). Came here with my Dad for a tea. It was delicious. Got a small Chai tea. Made sure to ask to not add extra sugars. We enjoyed drinking our teas on the patio. I came here one other time and the drive thru server had the most amazing custer service I have received in it seems like forever. I tipped him $10 on a 3 dollar tea just to thank him for his upbeat great service!!< /Text>

<text>My family and I have been going to Dr. Uma for over 2 years. She is a very humble and great dentist and has a wonderful staff. We were looking braces for my 13 yr son and we came to know that she is very experienced , so we visited and finally we got what we were looking. Last 2 years we are visiting to her clinic for any dental related work without second thought.
Last but not least the staff is wonderful, very helpful. This was my best experience ever, I would definitely recommend to others.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Dr. Patel and her entire staff is very professional and helpful.  My husband and I have been going to her for the last couple of years and she is amazing. She always takes time to explain the procedures, answers all our questions and never tries to rush through patients. As someone who has always been scared of doctors,  Dr. Patel and everyone in her practice made me feel comfortable and safe. She is very capable and her team is very well trained. Special shout out to Charleen for always making my experience a good one! I have had to see Dr. Patel multiple times during this last year for Invisalign treatment but even during Covid times, I have always felt safe here. I would highly recommend her.<//Review>

Dr Patel and her staff (special shout our to Sharleen) is amazingly helpful and friendly. First time I went in there, was advised on my options and associated expense with complete transparency. No pushing for add ons, no rushing though visitors. Definitely going to be my go-to place for time to come<//text>

Great experience and great service! I have been visiting Star dental for 2 yrs now. The service, professionalism, expertise of the doctor and her team has been exceptional. Dr. Uma Patel is very gentle in her approach & procedures which takes away a lot of anxiety and provides honest evaluation of dental problems/diagnosis. I highly recommend Star Dental's entire team to anyone who is looking for a fantastic dentist for all of dental problems!<//Text>

Dr.Uma is like an artist when she works on your teeth. I have great confidence in her ability and experience. Her pleasant attitude makes you forget why you are there. I hate going to dentist generally but with Uma it is a completely different experience. I look forward to seeing her.
Sharlene her staff is cherry on the cake and very easy to deal with. I recommend others to experience this when needed.</Text>

< Review>
Dr. Uma Patel is the best dentist ever! My wife and I started seeing Dr. Patel about 2 years now and we are glad to be part of Dr. Patel’s dental family. We were recommended by one of our family friends who is with Dr. Patel since last 10 years. She is patient-centric and builds long lasting relationship.
She is very persistent, listens to her patients, extremely knowledgeable and performs dental procedures with an excellency.
My wife recently had her two implants done and both went very smoothly. Before the surgery we met with her and she thoroughly explained us what the procedure is and what to expect after its completed. She has tremendous amount of experience which puts you at ease. She takes really good care of her patients and is truly exceptional in every way. Nevertheless her staff is very accommodating and friendly. She and her team are amazing and we will continue to go there and would highly recommend Dr. Uma Patel to anyone.< /Review>

Dr. Uma Patel is very good and caring doctor that I have seen. She handled me and my family very patiently and did her job wonderfully and she  exceeded my expectations. Few years before I had a severe problem in my tooth and when I went to her she did orthodontic procedure very well. She always make me understand everything and provides me very good guidance with the available options. Also I had Invisalign procedure that was really taken care by her and staff with great care.< /Review>

I can say they are the best  by far. They are very welcoming and do great work. No one likes to go to the dentist  but if I had a dental business I would want it to be like this! Honest, fair, welcoming and great customer service! Star dental is great place to go for great work, service and a friendly environment. They all smile and love there work.</review>< Resp>

Definitely 5 stars for Dr. Uma Patel. I recommend her for anyone seeking an all-around great dental experience. The staff is friendly and very efficient in resolving all types of issues. The facilities are great. And most of all, Dr. Patel is an excellent dentist. She provides compassionate care and the dental work is top notch. I always feel great when I walk out of her office. I have been going to her for years, and so have many people I have referred to her. The dental procedures so far have gone smoothly.</Review>

I strongly recommend Dr Uma and her clinic for your routine dental needs.

This was my first experience visiting her clinic along with my Mom, who is travelling from India. Mom's two teeth crown came off and it was an urgent situation so we walked into this clinic without prior appointment.

The receptionist was busy however it took her less than a minute to acknowledge and got us checked-in right away. The staff is really nice - quietly runs the clinic operations in the background and is almost invisible; clinic is super clean and professional; most importantly, Dr Uma is an Expert at what she does and has been around for over a decade! Both me and Mom felt, we were in good hands and could leave a Docs job to a Doc! It took her 20-min to take care of it and during the process, Doc was graceful & conversing with both of us - 'everything is under control'

Towards the end of our visit, I learnt that the receptionist, lost her 88-yr old grandmother yesterday; today she is at the clinic working and tomm she's at the funeral. My sincere condolences to her - Very sorry to hear about your mom and genuinely respect your commitment/dedication to this clinic.

Overall positive & spiritual vibes from this clinic and my Mom is all good. This is now my go to clinic for all family dental needs.<//text>

Dr. Uma Patel performed orthodontic braces treatment for my daughter for about 8 months. She achieved excellent results with her teeth, which made me and my daughter very happy! Also, Dr Patel is caring person. Visiting her, and her welcoming highly skilled staff was always a pleasure. Her experience, knowledge, kindness and working ethic are beyond the excellent, with perfectly clean place, and state of the art environment. If you are looking for good orthodontis, Dr. Patel is the perfect choice to address your needs, I am very pleased with the treatment received. I would highly recommend Dr. Patel to others who are looking for friendly and professional Dentist.</Review>

Dr. Uma is our family dentist. My kids and parents along with us have visited beautiful office for our dental work. We get timely reminder of our appointments, and are greeted by friendly staff during service. Dr. Patel has done braces for my daughter, dentures for my parents and crown work for my wife along with many routine cleaning / check up of my teeth. We all enjoy her professional skills along with interpersonal skills to deal with any issue of all the age patients nicely. Medical billing is handled also in very professional with clear communication to avoid any surprise or conflicts. I have recommended Star Dental to few of my friends and almost everyone thanked us and had similar experience with Dr. Uma Patel. Modern clinic with skillful dentist!<//Review>

< Review>
I would like to share my experience with recent visit at Star Dental in Fremont California.

Dr. Patel is very calm, friendly and thorough in her work, I am very pleased with the dental treatment I received. She is the best Dentist I have seen so far in Fremont, CA

Good things I liked:
- Very clean, hi-tech and huge office, almost like a townhouse.
- Staff is very professional and friendly.

I would definitely recommend her to my friends and family, and I never want to see another dentist again!</Review>

I would highly recommend Dr. Uma Patel for Implant Dentistry to anyone who needs any dental work. I personally received two implants. The appointment was set right away and I was pleased how fast and smooth everything went. First, Dr. Patel explained how implants should be placed after panaromic x-ray was taken... The price for both implants was much less than I was offered at several other places. Dr. Uma Patel personally placed my both the implant, and she is very professional and meticulous.

The crowns were also placed very professionally without much pain.  Since I was impressed with Dr. Patel's work, I brought my daughter  here too for Invisalign. Dr. Patel took care of that too at very reasonable rate compared to other I consulted in the neighborhood. I’m very glad that I found Dr. Patel.

Dr. Uma Patel and staff Charleen here are very professional and they provide excellent service.<//text>

Star Dental in Fremont is absolutely the best dental office in the bay area. Dr. Patel is very professional and spent a lot of time explaining what treatment I need, and provided me with educational materials that helped me to understand my situation clearly, and made decision based on facts. Front receptionist in the front were very polite and helpful too, no wait time, the assistant -Charleen was very courteous and made me feel that i was well taken care of. They also checked my insurance coverage and provided me different options. All in all, I was really pleased on how they provided me the best patient care that I ever experienced! Thank you Dr. Patel and staff, I recommend Dr. Patel patients who are looking for good dentist in fremont.</review>

<text>It is strange to love your dentist but I do. All I can say is that everyone is very friendly and accommodating. Dr.  Patel and her staff did great job for my orthodontic braces. They don't leave you in waiting room for ever and they are always willing to squeeze me in as needed.

My experience is always great! Going to the orthodontist is not anyone's favorite thing,  but I am very pleasantly surprised with professional treatment with Dr. Patel

Since we had such a positive experience,  so now my husband has started tooth Implant and so far almost no pain and performed very smooth procedure. Thanks to Dr.  Patel and staff!<//text>< response>

I would definitely recommend Dr. Patel and her wonderful staff to anyone looking for a dentist or looking to change dentists.  Dr. Patel is such a caring, gentle person and a very skilled and knowledgeable dentist.  I no longer live or work in the immediate area, but I choose to continue coming to Dr. Patel and traveling.  The staff is great about accommodating my schedule when it comes to making appointments.  I still have my wisdom teeth and recently one of them broke.  I was told it was too broken to repair or to try a crown...it had to be extracted.  I think Dr. Patel sensed that I was a little stressed over an extraction.  She went ahead and offered to try to and repair the tooth by filling it.  She not only tried once, but twice.  The break in the tooth was too big and both times the filling wouldn't keep.  After the 2nd time, I made the appointment for the extraction.  The procedure went well, virtually no pain!  Dr Patel had me in and out in less than an hour and it's healing fine!  Thank you Dr. Patel, you knew my wisdom tooth had to come out....but you still tried to save it anyway, twice ...just so I wouldn't stress over the extraction.<//text>

I really loved it and will definitely recommend to my friends and relatives. Dr. Patel is very professional, and excellent Dentist!, the staff are very nice and the facility is very clean. From my previous experienced with other Dentist, after the routine cleaning they will schedule you for the procedure that needs to be done, but with Star Dental they accommodated my request to proceed with the procedure because I was really in pain, the made it possible and squeezed me in their schedule that same date and time. They really took good care of me that day and I loved how Dr. Patel. When I went back today for the permanent crown, the more that I was convinced that Dr. Patel and staff are very professional. Thank you Dr. Patel for accommodating me, you took the pain away immediately :) Thank you to the staff too for being patient and nice :)</text>

I have been visiting Doctor Uma Patel for last 3 years along with my family. I have come to enjoy my visits to the doctor as compared to my earlier self when I will visit a doctor only in an emergency. To sum up my experience with Dr. Uma and her office – I find them efficient, professional, trustworthy and accommodating.  In my latest good experience with them, I had a situation that I was travelling out of country and one of my tooth starting giving me trouble just before I had to fly and on top of that it was a Sunday. I called and left message describing my situation. To my pleasant surprise, I got a call back soon and Dr. fixed my tooth on Sunday morning at 9 a m just before my flight. I reached at nine ready to wait for her but no, I didn’t have to wait as she was there right on time. She had adjusted my need in her personal time. And I feel wonderful  and happy to have them in my neighborhood and would recommend them to my friends with great pleasure.</Text>

I got my Dental Implant done with Dr.Uma and my experience is more than pleasant. I am very much afraid initially when I come to know about the process but  Dr.Uma made me feel that I am in safe hands.  Staff also needs special mention for the caring they show and timely reminder of the appointments.<//text>

I found Dentist Dr. Uma Patel and the entire staff who worked on my root canals, (2 of them) along with the porcelain crowns, to be very accomodating & very professional. They were very understanding & sympathetic about my pain I was having with my teeth. They took the time to explain everything they were going to do and gave me several options. I highly recommend this dentist for your dental needs.</text>

And I am very impressed that everthing she has done never caused me pain and found her to be very professional. Also my whole family is very impressed with professional oral hygiene care Dr. Patel for past many years. Charleen in front is very prompt and easy to schedule appointments.

<Review>I have been very lucky to have Dr. Uma Patel as my dentist for a very long time. I had a few cavities and she filled up all my cavities with the right amount of filling material with ease and precision. I haven't had to do the filling again since she fixed all my cavities. Her staff is so flexible and they will adjust the appointment dates as per your availability. My friends also go there for root canal, fixed broken teeth, crown and teeth cleaning. She also educate us and explain everything ( X-rays) before the treatment. I would highly highly recommend her for any kind of dental problems.</Review>< Pictures>

Star Dental is by far the best dentist I have ever been to. Dr. Patel and her staff are amazing. Sharlene the dental assistant is very sweet and helps me and my husband Brian at each visit. We live in San Leandro but don't mind the drive for the service we receive here. We just got our Invisalign put on today and we can't wait for the results. Thanks Star Dental for helping us with our smile!</text>

With Dr. Uma Patel, I did not find any reviews on Yelp but I did find a lot of great reviews on other sites and though she looks very young from the picture I decided to try her. The first time I went to her, she took my x-rays and came up with a treatment plan and patiently explained to me why a certain treatment was required. She spoke to me about my budget and how much I could afford to spend this year and priorotized treatment accordingly. This was something that impressed me the most cause she respected my financial situation and was willing to work with me. She told me upfront that I needed a crown and a few re-fillings and what the cost would be. In just 1 month, she did my crown and 3 other teeth.

Dr. Uma Patel is very skilled, dedicated and quick with an experience of 10+ years (Dont let her looks fool you). She did a great job with my teeth and my bite was perfect everytime. She and her staff are very friendly and appointments are easy to get. Good dentists are difficult to find and I almost did not want to share her. But reviews have helped me before and I hope this will help someone else discover Dentist in Fremont – Dr Uma Patel (Star Dental).< /Text><gmap_id>0x808fbf5de1c21537:0x956c7b80a193ed5f< /gmap_id><user_name>Chandresh Patel<//user_name>< Pics>

Are you sacred of the dentist, if yes, you ought to visit Dr Uma Patel who is based out in Fremont,CA.
She is highly skilled , professional and apt at her work.She does the initial analysis and gives you options with your treatment and timeline.
As described by other reviewers she does not force upon any treatment and also does not scare you with the condition of your tooth/gums.
She patiently listens to you and explains in depth the cause of your problem.I have been umteen times to her clinic and have always received a wonderful service.
And not to mention the staff, they are worth equally appreciation.
All in all, you will not find it as a conventional dental clinic because of the friendly,skillful and adjusting behaviour of the doctor and her staff.
I hightly recommend to everyone to try this doctor atleast with regular cleaning and know for yourself.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I had my own washer and dryer for many years and when I made my last move I didn't have a spot for them.  I was spending time going back and forth to the laundry room for a while and then I found Life Without Laundry...  They pick up one day and it comes back the following day...  neatly folded... and all I have to do is put things away.  It is just perfect.  I highly recommend this service and I am certain that you will be happy.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1602186364633, 'text': 'Thanks so much for the kind review!

< Review>
Life Without Laundry has been the answer to my Santa Monica apartment prayers. I have very high quality clothes and they take the utmost care of them and follow instructions perfectly every time. I never thought I'd be able to trust someone else with my laundry, but they have earned it! I have been a customer for almost a year now and I have gotten to know some of the employees. They are attentive, kind, and professional. I'm very particular and have not a had a problem yet. They are easy to get in touch with if and overall an amazing service! Thank you LWL for providing top notch service to people without laundry units and/or busy schedules!<//Review>

<text>So nice to not have to take my king sized blankets to a local laundromat! LWL arrived 2 days after I initially signed up for their services within the time frame that I signed up for. I also saw that they pickup/drop off late at night, as an option, which I thought could be convenient- if needed. I took a star off because I was not informed (nor was there information on their website) about their COVID-19 requirement that all laundry must be sealed/covered by a bag. I didn’t have any type of bag large enough to fit 2 king-sized comforters - so I put them in my laundry basket for the pickup-person. She was nearly about to leave without taking my laundry until she figured she’d go to car to give me one of their laundry bags (which they give you, complimentary, when they return your laundry the first time). It all worked out, but could’ve been more convenient (the pickup person could’ve just picked it up from my doorstep) had I know to seal everything in a bag. Also, the cost doubled from the time I made an initial payment online to the time they weighed my laundry - so roughly a bit over $80 in total....not their fault, but still was a lot more than I expected. Either way, I will be using them again!< /text>< Date>

<review>This service is awesome!! On my first time trying it my city was not one that they serviced, but Alex went out of his way and made it happen. I have used them a few months now and their quality and prices are excellent. They are good at communicating with their clients for pick ups and drop offs. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a laundry service. They also provide dry cleaning. Keep up the good work!!!!!< /review>< name>

I like the service and will use it again. I chose a pickup time of 12pm to 2PM, the pickup guy was at my house 12PM. The drop off was on time as well. My clothes are clean, folded and smells nice just how I advised them during the order process.  Only concern was the thin plastic bag that they use when returning your clothes could be more durable, other than that, I feel the service is great for someone that needs help with their laundry.</Text>

<Date>1580268861760< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>In the last year, my physical disability began to hinder my regular trips to the onsite laundry room in my apartment building. The stairs were becoming an obstacle when transporting 2-3 loads of laundry. After much research, I settled on Life Without Laundry and have not been disappointed.  They use the non-allergenic, unscented soap and dryer sheets I include with my laundry bags, pick up on time and deliver the next day also on time. I found myself wondering why I waited so long to use a laundry service. My clothes come back folded and packed in a bag. All I need to do is put them away. If I ever had an issue, Alex was right there with the solution or information I needed. Communication has always been easy, good, and profession.

I can’t recommend this service highly enough. Their pricing may be a bit more than competitors, but the quality of service is nonpareil.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Great service! I use the wash and fold. Pick up and delivery is always on time and drivers are friendly. Used them several times with no issues. Once I felt a load if sheets had not been washed so I texted and they said just place a new order and they would redo them at no cost. Everything went smoothly. I highly recommended them.</text>

This service is so easy to use with their online scheduling system. The 2 rounds of pick ups we have done so far have been on time. Laundry comes back very neatly organized. The pricing in my opinion is very fair as well. This has been a great help to us the last few weeks when we’ve been working too much to stay on top of the wash.< /text>

<Review>I found out about LWL after I realized the shared washer at my unit was slowly destroying clothes. The whole process is super easy and personalized- from being able to save preferences and instructions on the LWL website to getting live updates for pickup and delivery, and even Alex is available by text. The clothes always come back soft and neatly folded. This is a great service.< /Review></record>

Familiar with the Boston service, I spent 10 days in California and was thrilled to learn the service has opened a west coast location. Same great service and attention to detail as the Boston area service, and the owner is on the same timezone out here so it makes correspondence even easier. You can get laundry done at lots of places but the concierge-level service makes the difference.< /Review>

We really liked using the Life Without Laundry services. It was very nice not to deal with loads of laundry myself and have it delivered washed and nicely folded instead. Alex the owner seems to care and makes sure to follow up accordingly. It is just pretty pricey compare to going to a laundry mat or doing it yourself at home. We will use this service again.<//text>

<Text>Service drop-off times are much more flexible than competitors with daytime drop-off times available which was a lifesaver when needing to get linens cleaned for events at work.  Very professional and responsive and such a huge time-saver!  Definitely my go-to vendor for laundry related needs in L.A.<//Text>< user_id>

<text>My apartment's washing machine was broken and so I looked into a delivery service...I was so happy with the service that will continue to use even though the machines work now. Service was fast and clothes smelled good!  Pro tip: try dry cleaning, clothes come back good as new. They even give you a cookie :)< /text>< Pictures>

This service is amazing!  It feels so luxurious to have your laundry done for you.  Even my underwear arrived perfectly folded.  They actually air dry my delicates too!  I’m so in love!  ❤️ So reasonably priced too.  This is a MUST if you live in the city and have a busy life as I do.< /Text>

<review>I love Life Without Laundry.
When I call they answer the phone "How can I help you Gordon."
One of the best Delivery Services I have ever used.
Schedule Pickup, Delivery, then relax with no worries. I know everything will be professionally taken care of.
At this time of Covid19, hell of a lot safer than a laundry room.< /review><pics>None</pics><gmapID>0x80c2ba867a86c48f:0x24d0de50de7283bf< /gmapID>< username>

I just moved to LA a few months back, but still live an NYC life-style. I am always on the go and Life Without Laundry has allowed me to get SO much time back because let's be real, dealing with laundry takes way too much time. Not only do they do your laundry within 24 hours, but they personally pick up and drop off your bag! They send pictures of confirmed delivery and routine text message updates so you always know the status of your order. Each time I've had a question or small issue, Alex and the team have been swift in answering + resolving. Service overall is A+.< /text>

Came into Boston on the second leg of our vacation with dirty laundry.  I had researched Life Without Laundry as a possibility for this situation prior to our trip, but thought maybe hotel had laundry facilities that just weren't advertised. Confirmed upon arrival that hotel did not have laundry facility, but did offer laundry service....priced per item. Yikes!
So 8 pm on Tuesday I actually call to inquire because website won't let me book for that evening pick up and I wanted my clothes the next day, not two days later. The person I spoke to....wish I could remember his name 😕...told me he'd check to see if he still had drivers out that late. He couldn't have been more accommodating! Driver would be there at hotel desk within 15-20 minutes and laundry would be delivered back next day. I was out all day next day and hadn't heard from hotel about a delivery, but when I checked with LWL late in the afternoon Wednesday, I learned that my laundry had actually been delivered a little after noon to the hotel welcome desk!! Way less than a 24 hour turn-around and no effort or time wasted doing laundry on my vacation!
I was leery about using such a service, since I had never done so in the past, BUT I won't hesitate to use the services of Life Without Laundry in the future, should the need arise and I'm in an area where these services are offered. Boston LWL, you guys rock!! Thank you so much!!<//review>

< review>
Want to feel like a Boss? Use this service. I work 60 hours a week with zero time or patience for laundry and dry cleaning. Had a service at the office that charges me an arm and a leg and never was done in time. With LWL, my undershirts came back bright white and folded with military precision and my office attire was clean and creased to perfection. And when I called in to make a couple changes to my pick up/delivery schedule, I spoke directly to the owner Alex who personally made sure I got what I wanted. LIKE A BOSS!</review>

I used LWL when my husband was away out of state for work for a whole month. We have an Australian Shepherd dog and she loves getting sand and dirt on her on the daily, & she loves jumping on our bed, making our comforters, you guessed it! Sandy & dirty! We usually do our own laundry, but with my husband being away, I needed the help. LWL did me a favor and did a same day pick up and next day delivery. Alex was easy to reach and texted me right away. Both comforters, one for the humans and one for the dog, were sparkling white and cleaned upon return. I loved the service so much I sold the idea to husband that we should get our comforters cleaned by LWL regularly and the next time we needed it cleaned, it was my hubs putting in the order. We are both fans!< /Text>

Key Points:
* Deliveries have been totally on time within the provided window (Small window too)
* Text updates so in case I'm a total POS and need to snooze my delivery I can easily do so
* Followed my care instructions with excellent folding (I'm OCD about my darks and hate fading)
* Great price point with a very reasonable min load qty.
* Easy to navigate and use website, very professional and I feel like I'm not sending my laundry out to a sketchy perv. but an actual real service
* Supporting local business is always v. nice
* Very honest team, totally left a bunch of stuff in my pockets and it was returned very nicely in a cute little folded pocket they made.

Anyways if you are looking for a Wash & Fold (with many other services) you gotta try Life Without Laundry.  Cannot say enough good things.  Alex, the owner, knows what it takes to run a business.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Not the way I treat my long time loyal customers in my business.

We had a terrific experience with the Enterprise Car Rental in Grover Beach.  They picked us up at our RV park so that we could retrieve our car, and the service was speedy and professional.  Our rental car exceeded our expectations and was extremely comfortable.  We thought the rates were reasonable.  Bill and Garrett both did a great job.  We'd rent from them again, for sure.</text>

<review>This location is by far the best Enterprise car rental location in my opinion.  Ther are professional, and willing to work with you when you need extensions or anything at all. The location is extremely clean and easy to find. The employees are extremely friendly and always greet you with a smile. They will pick you up they will drop you off. It is a One-Stop car rental shop. They always try to find you the best price or deal for the best vehicle you need. I couldn't ask for more. thank you 5th Street Enterprise car rental in Grover Beach California.<//review>< pictures>

Unbeknownst to them, I received a car that was smoked in and had to change it out in Las Vegas, Both locations treated me so good and was so sorry I had to endure a six hour ride in a smoky car. Grover Beach Mgr was great and gave me a discount on my weekly rental. I would definitely use them again!!< /Review>

Just outstanding running two businesses it's hard when you only have a couple of cars and every once in awhile I got to put the car in to the shop and I need a car to rent Enterprise is the first and only place I call I love how you can accumulate points and be able to redeem them down the road always ask how my service was and 10 Stars every time I've rented over six different cars from this place never had a problem!!</Review>

<Text>We have a  motorhome and love to camp; however, we decided we didn't want to be towing a vehicle each time we traveled.  Enter Enterprise!  We reserve a car at our destination, Enterprise picks us up to bring us to their office to fill out the necessary paperwork and we have a car for the weekend!  When we return the car, they bring us back to our camp sight.  Works for us!< /Text></record>

The Grover Beach Enterprise is defiantly my favorite now. The employees never let me down and are always in a cheerful mood. They either have the vehicle I want or they upgrade to a better vehicle which is always a great surprise. The vehicles are always clean and ready to go!< /review>

<text>The service was great. The pick up time was short and quick. They even picked me up from work to get the car. I ended up needing longer than I expected and they accommodated me for an entire week when I originally only planned on 2 days. When I took the car back I didn’t even have to go inside. They met me out front and I was done and on my way in less than 5 minutes.

I always enjoy great service from the Grover Beach Enterprise office. They are kind and considerate folks who work with you on getting a comfortable vehicle at a competitive price. Their courtesy in picking guests up at no additional charge is a policy that keeps me coming back when I need a rental. Never had a bad experience yet after many years with Enterprise; I cannot recommend them enough!<//Text>

The staff people are always polite and courteous.  It's a very busy location and they are juggling a lot, and constantly multi-tasking; however they remain calm and polite.  I do find that this location is too busy for its geographic space.  It's hard to find parking to simply return the car.  It's not a pleasant atmosphere at all and the cleaning process is occurring right in front, in the midst of all the action.  Lastly, my most recent car was very dirty both inside and outside, which was a disappointment.  They simply didn't have enough staff to handle the number of customers at that time.  I am considering going back to the SLO location next time.< /text>

Positive notes: The attendant who helped me find the car was very nice. The price was very clear and I knew what I was paying for.  The time it took from beginning to end was reasonably short.
The car ran good.
Negative notes: The gentleman behind the counter was not very personable.
The parking for the rental cars seemed to be a bit of a circus. They were parked down the street, around the corner and parked on the main street.
Finding the car I rented was like looking for a  piece to a puzzle.
The driver and passenger seats were stained and did not look very appealing.<//Text>

Fantastic client relations. I requested eco car and they didn't have one available, so they upgraded at no additional charge. Great staff and management. Highly recommend!<//review>

<Review>I am grateful to have Enterprise in town. the pick up and delivery service is nice. I am glad i did not need to go to the airport to get a car. That saved me some money. Cash was my agent but the entire staff are there to help. I agree with a previous comment. They need a better location. Try them out.< /Review><name>Michael Lynch< /name><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80ec59343b45d3b1:0x7a27cd9ba081cbbb< /gmap_id></record>

Service was excellent but I was disappointed with vehicle condition. The vehicle was ready for the pasture. The drivers side carpet was wore to the floor the rear window didn't seal shut all the making the wind noise annoying for the passengers and there was a hole in the ceiling above rear view mirror where a part fell off and was not replaced and windows and outside needed to be cleaned. Like I said they were courteous but Enterprise usually keeps their fleet in better condition.< /Text>

The staff was friendly and courteous.  They processed the pickup and drop-off efficiently and got me on my way quickly.  I had to extend my rental by one day and they accommodated my request with professional efficiency.  I have rented from this location, which is only a few blocks from my house, on several occasions and have never been dissatisfied.  Very convenient and friendly.<//review>

Incredibly Displeased.  I reserved a car on line this morning, however i was called shortly afterward and told they would have no vehicles available at the time requested.  I was told they should be able to accommodate me with a vehicle by 4pm or so. So I waited all day, hoping for a call back.  When I received no call, I called the office.  After getting lost on hold a few times I was told they were working on getting me a vehicle by 5pm.  At 5:30pm, with no call back and unable to get through via phone, i went down to the office once I noticed they closed at 6pm. I waited in the office until after 6pm, at which time I was told they would not be able to set me up with a vehicle.  I decided to walk back home to let off a little steam.  I wasted the entire day waiting for a vehicle to attend to a family emergency.  If they would have told me that morning they would not be able to accommodate me, I would have tried to make other arrangements.</Review>

<text>Really good experience. They picked me up at the RV park at promised time after calling to inform me of when they would arrive. I was in and out of the office in 5 minutes. When I returned the car, we were on the way back to the RV park in about 10 minutes. And the car was very nice. Exceeded expectations.< /text>< pics>

<text>Experience was quick and easy. We couldn't get the Van we wanted because they needed to replace a battery in a key fob, I would of went and got a battery and paid for it myself had they let me, so that was a little annoying. But overall a good experience.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I work remotely but do a bit of local travel using a rental car.   There is nothing better than having an Enterprise Car Rental a few blocks away.

The staff is very helpful and pleasant,  but never plentiful.   For some reason, this ia a very busy locations and they always seem understaffed.

Although extremely convenient,  I do have a couple of complaints.

First, the cars are always filthy on the outside.  Maybe it's because they are shorthanded or the proximity to the beach, but the cars are always dirty.

My second conplaint is related to their Saturday hours.  They close at 12 noon, which  can be inconvenient.

In total, this location is a good representation of Enterprise's great customer service.<//review>

Enterprise Grover Beach has the best staff!  We rent a car about 2 or 3 times a month and they always have a clean car or even a truck for me!  I needed a truck and they found one and had it ready for me at pick up time.<//review>

<review>I'm a regular for years now and have watched the quality of the rentals drop over the last year or so.  These days I'm consistently getting cars that are filthy, are displaying persistent and distracting service lights/messages, Sirus systems are not registered and blue tooth pairing not working.  I also called and asked for a specific brand of car which was not provided.  I told the guy and the counter about my displeasure and he just shrugged it off...implied they would try to do better next time... but this was a 'next time'.  Can expect "only game in town" type of treatment I guess.  Opportunity knocking for a competitor?!?<//review><Response>{'time': 1424713590813, 'text': 'Hi Shaun.

<text>At the rental location, the rental wasn’t ready nor available at the time for pickup. The agent state he would call me when car is available. I waited for a phone call, but I had to call back to check If a car is available after 45 mins. I wouldn’t probably gotten a call if I didn’t follow up. Car rental should be available at the time for pickup due to reservation booked.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>GET IT IN WRITING!!!!!!!
They quote you one price and the stick you in the end!!!  Car was dirty when I picked it up and then they over charged me $60. They apologized and offered me a discount which amounted to a big whopping $10. Drive extra distance to Santa Maria and get a car there.<//Review>< date>

<review>Small number of vehicles available and you have to settle for a type of vehicle you really did not want.  Many times upon renting had to go straight to the car wash to have the car washed and cleaned.  Many times have had to go straight to the gas station and fill up prior to leaving town.  The staff is friendly.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Excellent service. I completed the required forms online prior to my appointment, so there was barely any wait time at the office. Professional staff, explained the procedures well and made me comfortable before proceeding to start. Highly recommend!< /Review>

<text>I was sent to one address, then sent to another address, then back to the first address, the second place was so full there was no place to sit, when I was finally called up, the female helping me kept talking to a man a few spots down and kept putting me off to do so. It took me from 11:00 to 1:30 to get a 15 minute MRI. To top it all off, I asked for a copy, was told to wait. 20 minutes or so went by, so I asked. The girl up front told me it takes 2-3 minutes, so the girl who had me waiting forgot about me and did it in about 3 minutes, they definitely need some management to get involved in making this place more efficient<//text>< Pictures>

Known as Kern Rad to me! Always attentive to my needs and willing to accommodate my strange requests if at all possible. The units are always looking clean and organized. And the best part is the staff are loving and kind and make me feel like I could ask for the moon and they would go get it for me and continue to smile at me. Everyone is so nice! 5 STARS!<//review>

<name>Hazel</name><Text>This facility was amazing and they checked me in pretty quick. I loved that prior to my appointment they called me with and automated voice and they also sent a text with the time of my appointment and address. This made it helpful to confirm the location since they do have more than one. I got an ultrasound and the technician was very sweet and answered any questions or concerns I had. An amazing facility and staff!< /Text>< Pics>

I recently took in my 92-year-old mother for a CT Scan here.  The staff and technicians were all quite friendly, helpful, and professional.  We both had a positive experience.  I was more concerned for my mom, who was recently diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia, and as to how she’d respond to this experience, but I was surprised that she did well.  It helped that everyone who interacted with her exhibited a calm and pleasant demeanor.  So yes, based on this experience I would recommend this radiological site to others.  Thank you.< /review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>It always takes awhile to check in with any doctors office or lab, but this was fast. You do your paperwork ahead of time and turn it in then simply let them know that you’re waiting in your vehicle or go inside and let them know that you’re there. In a few minutes you’re called into the back to have the MRI or Ultrasound done ( whatever you need) and you can leave afterwards.< /Review><Rate>5</Rate>< UserId.>

Everyone was very nice but I had to wait over an hour to be called back to the appointment I made. They asked me to arrive 20 minutes early and then made me wait over an hour. They need to manage their appointments better.<//review>

< Review>
Pre-filled my paperwork on line prior to arrival. I got there 20 minutes early to check in and was told I was going to have to wait an hour and a half for my MRI. I asked if I could leave and return and was told no I had to stay.  I tried to reschedule but no dates were available for almost two weeks.
I waited 40 minutes beyond my scheduled appointment.  Once I was taken back my MRI Specialist was awesome.  He was very knowledgeable, friendly and checked to see if I was comfortable often.
The office was packed and I heard staff telling many patients that x-rays were an hour to an hour and a half wait....< /Review>

Went for a CT scan. I’m very claustrophobic tried once but chickened out. They were very nice and let me have another try. They dimmed the lights let me listen to my music on my phone but no earbuds allowed. I closed my eyes the minute I laid down and I made it through the 15-20 minute procedure.</Text>

The staff are very friendly and I was seen very quickly.  The only concern I have is that they are not doing temp checks like all other medical facilities are doing. Also, they don't have any social distancing sitting in the waiting area or in the back area where you wait to be called for the procedure.< /review>

My first time at this place and I really recommend this place.  I would definitely come back to this place.  I like the people that work there. From the time I walked and checked in . People are really caring, nice, polite, good at their job . I had an ultra sound and x-rays done. Those are the departments I visited today.<//text>

I did wish they took me to the back a little closer to my appointment time because of the fact that I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant and couldn't use the restroom until after my appointment..

Thank you Kern Radiology. My ultrasound was great! I really appreciate you going the extra mile to keep your gel in a warmer. Not having the shock of ice cold gel was nice for a change and made a world of difference. You guys Rock!</Review>

I went in to have an x-ray of both my knee and my hip. Everyone at the front counter was pleasant and helpful. I was into see a radiology technician sooner than I had anticipated. Alejandra was extremely patient because it was somewhat painful to move my hip. She was very thorough and pleasant the entire time. The waiting room was pleasant, not overcrowded, and had a Teleprompter with the information in regards to different x-rays. My entire experience was very pleasant. If any of my friends ask where they should go I would definitely recommend Kern radiology.<//Review>

The people working in the facility were nice and professional. However, more than 2 hour delay was unacceptable. I had 8:00 pm appointment (check-in time 7:30 pm) but I was in the MRI room at 10:10 pm and got out of the facility at 10:40 pm. This is the second time that I used this facility. There was more than olan hour delay while first time. They should reduce the number patients they admit per day.</text>

<review>They are very respectful of you and your needs. Sometimes you get all of your paperwork done before they come to get you for your exam. This person is very nice and helpful in explaining what will happen. They talk to you live a person and now a number. I love going there for my MRI, CT, Exrays and mammogram. Plus the lady that puts your port in is awesome. I refuse to go anywhere else. Stock dale office.only<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
I had an excellent experience here! The staff was nice and very timely and efficient!! The technician who took care of me was Katie (I'm pretty sure that was her name) and she made me feel comfortable and answered all my questions. I was also called when they received my referral to schedule an appointment and I was given super clear instructions for pre-procedure. They really made this experience quick and easy.<//Review>

My technician really took his time to explain the CT Urogram. He explained the step by step procedure and how it would make me feel after. I really felt he cared and he made me feel comfortable the entire time. Easy process from check in to the very end.<//text>

This location of  Kern Radiology was terrific. I received service quickly and the staff at the front desk was wonderful. I listened to one employee at the front desk help someone who was not an English speaker. She was so patient and kind and the man was very thankful to her. I was very impressed with her work ethic.   The employee who helped with my chest X-ray was also very nice. I recommend this location.</Review>

<Response>None</Response><date>1606586567253</date><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Staff was courteous, friendly, and efficient. I had an MRI of my Kern IV Al spine. The MRI tube however was the oldest piece of MRI imaging equipment I had ever encountered. The tube was tiny. The walls touched my arms and legs and the tube was only two inches above my face. I am not a claustrophobic person, never had been, until today in that tube. The noises were so loud the imaging tech provided me w earplugs. I had to keep my eyes closed because it I had never been inside MRI equipment this old and this small. I am concerned with the out of date equipment will not have provided the images my doctors need to diagnose properly! Next time I will use Quest, their imaging equipment is much more modern  and the staff there is just as efficient and friendly as at Kern Radiology. Thank you for your time today, I hope this helps!!</text>< Rate>

Had an appointment at 2:30 and it took almost an hour waiting and then I was put in a different room and it took almost another 45 minutes.

I showed up at 2:00 and end up at 4:00 for an 8 minute MRI very disappointed<//Text>

My appointment was @7:50 and arrived @7:30 as requested , but was still waiting @9:15am. I had to asked if I was forgotten. I wasn’t done until after 10:05 am. The staff is nice and professional , but the waiting time is unacceptable. They were late because they took someone without appointment prior to me.< /Review>

The woman who did my ultrasound was very nice. She made a very uncomfortable situation as comfortable as it could get. If I have to go back in the future and have any ultrasounds or x-rays done, I will definitely go back to the same facility.</review>

<review>The staff were very nice and I appreciate them for doing their best in difficult times, but the social distancing was impossible as the room was too full of people, very stuffy, with little ventilation.  I thought it strange that a medical facility didn’t have better Covid safety rules.  I Would strongly suggest they put 20 chairs outside in the fresh air with a speaker outside to call people in for their appointments. It would be safer for employees and for patients, since a majority of patients arriving to check-in appeared to be over 60 years old and none of us seemed to know we could go and stand outside to wait for our appointments.
I was told to arrive 20 minutes early for my 9:45 am appointment, which I did.  I ended up waiting over one hour in that oppressive, hermetically sealed lobby area until they called me into the back for my appointment.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Horrible , ive been waiting for a CT since September 2020. My dr. Sent a authorization they denied it.he sent another. They never checked the new one they kept denying it. Because of the first denial. I've called
My insurance several times and they told me it was approved. It took the insurance to have me on three way to tell them it was approved . they're so incompetent they never follow through with calling or making sure that the dr. Orders are completed.< /Text><Rating>1</Rating><pictures>None<//pictures>< Gmap_id>

Love this location 💜 they allowed me to wait in my car till it was time for my x-ray, called me on the phone to tell me they were ready for me, and explained everything throughly. The x-ray was over in minutes. Thank you for being a great, efficient team!< /Text>

I had expected to wait 45 minutes before being called back for the X-ray of my foot but I was pleasantly surprised when I was called after only around 10 minutes. I was in & out in only about 20 minutes. Great job people.<//Review>

I had a very nice experience@ Kern Radiology. It was clean and the people working there were real nice and polite.  The Radiologist he was very helpful in making me feel comfortable because I was on oxygen and needed my head up a little so he put pillows we're I could breathe and be comfortable. I will recommend to my family and friends.< /Text>

I was a walk-in patient...I was told my wait would be 1 hour..it was only 35 minutes  ..once I was with the ex ray tech things were moving very quickly.
The tech was friendly and efficient.   I felt that this young lady was very confident and knowledgeable in her chosen field.
A pleasant experience  on my part.< /Review>

I was scheduled at 7:30 a.m. for an MRI at the 9330 Stockdale Highway location.  I arrived on time and had pre-filled my forms online.  It took one hour before I was called back at 8:30 a.m. to change, then I had to sit for another 20 minutes.  My MRI process was less than 15 minutes.  By the time I walked out it was 9:10 a.m.  I had anticipated to be done in an hour, that is why I scheduled myself early.  Due to the long wait I had to call my supersvisor to inform I would be late to work, which threw off my work day, and after work plans because I had to stay late to make up my time.  My time is valuable too.<//text>

I received a text message that said my appointment was at 1:20. We all ride to that one to make sure we had time to fill out paperwork. It was over an hour before we actually saw anyone for ACT. We learned our appointment was actually for 140. Then why did I get a text message that said it was at 1:20? We heard from others in the lobby and waiting rooms that they experienced the same problem<//text>

It was a good visit. Was a bit of a wait for an X-ray and I suggest you call and make an appointment for your other needs.<//review>

<Review>I was told to arrive 1 hr early because I needed to check in and take some oral contrast.  I said, I’m confused because there isn’t supposed to be any contrast.  The person said , no that just means there is no IV contrast.   I then asked if there were any other instructions and was told not to eat anything 4 hours prior to the exam.   It turns out I only had to be 20 min early, there was no contrast oral or otherwise AND I did not have to be without food.    Once more,the tech said the company has been having a problem with the appointment staff telling people this when they didn’t know.   This annoys me and is unforgivable.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80ea43da4fa050cd:0x3a23b3fec2aec522<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

<Text>Today I had an appointment at this place and when I arrived they told me that I had no scheduled appointment, I went back to my car to call my provider and confirm my appointment and they told me that my appointment was on the agenda, but when I returned to the place they told me to wait, after 20 min. Nobody came to me again, I left the place enraged by that kind of incompetent and unprofessional people.

My doctor said I didn’t need an appointment but I had to wait an hour and 15 minutes even though I got checked in before they opened at
8 am.  I would definitely make an appointment next time.  The X-ray tech was nice and efficient and the appointment itself was a good experience.<//text>

Once I arrived at correct location things were fast, friendly and efficient.  But having more than one Kern Radiology in one strip mall without patients getting correct information creates a lot of confusion.  I saw several patients at wrong location being routed to the other location.</Text>

<Review>My visit to Kern Radiology was super easy. The office assistant that checked me in was extremely pleasant and helpful. The technician was professional and skilled at placement of my IV. I didn’t even feel it. The rest of the nurses were friendly. Having a MRI at their facility was a breeze.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

Great people! the time I walked in and the time I done Xrays...very pleasant people, when one can't help, there's one who'll pick up the slack, there was no long wait. Great attitude, personality & character altogether great.</Text>

Both receptionist were super distracted and more focused on their own personal conversation. One receptionist stated to the other receptionist that, it was ok to make mistakes because “ It’s Friday”. They were also concerned about another co-worker who seemed to be running late for some reason. Other than that the X-ray technician was pretty amazing(5 star). She was performed her job quickly and efficiently. She is the reason Kern Radiology received starts if at all.</Text>

They need to do a better job of ensuring they aren't over booking patients or allowing walk ins. My appointment was at 1:30pm and I wasn't called in until 3pm, I left the office at 4pm. The check in system seems a bit chaotic. They do not do a good job of communicating. The only positive part was when I was finally called to the back. The MRI staff were wonderful.

Covid-19 related:
During this Covid-19 frenzy and the fact so many safety precautions are being implemented in various places I was disappointed to see Kern Radiology lacked all of them. The only protocol they have adapted is mandatory facemask. The lobby is overcrowded and the seating area was not complying with the 6 feet minimum advisory. I do not see any type of sanitation going on. People would sit, there was no disinfectant ion afterward, and they weren't even screening patients at the door. There is no procedure in place regarding patient safety. I really hope they read my review and do what they can to ensure they are protecting staff and patients.< /text>

The ladies in the front desk are all very professional and friendly.
The young lady in the back who did my xray was very nice, friendly and talk with me a little. Which was nice. She got my xrays done quick. Which was appreciated.
My visit to Kern Radiology was very nice and fast< /text>

<text>I will not be returning to this site. The technician took her lunch before seeing me at my scheduled time. She and the other staff neglected to tell me. That is completely unacceptable and unprofessional...especially during a pandemic when no one should wait longer than necessary.

I am grateful for the services Kern Radiology has for this community. Your techs are great. Scheduling the right kind of test can be challenging. Appreciate everyone’s efforts.  I would like to suggest counseling front desk employees that the term “honey” or “hunny” is not a comforting way to address customers. Many find it rather demeaning as well as dismissing.<//review>

I have gone to other facilities, or to other radiology centers, but the Riverwalk location is my first time and I loved the service more than other places, I forget to ask the name of the employees, but both the receptionist and the radiologist, they were very attentive to me.

<text>I had an order for an X-ray I arrived earlier in the week around 10:00AM. I was told the wait was 1.5 hours. I opted to come back another time. I came back on Friday at 2:00pm since they told me they were closed for lunch 11:00-1:30ish (what a lunch break). I was told the wait was about an hour. I sat quietly in the waiting room and around 3:30 I inquired how much longer that it had been past the about time I was told. The young lady told me it was only an estimate and that there were 3 patients still ahead of me. I sat back down and waited. I was called by the tech about 4:20 taken back changed, had my X-ray all within 15 minutes. 2.5 hours is an excessive amount of time to wait for a X-ray. They turn patients away for X-ray at 4:00 even though their business hours state longer. COVID friendly I would say yes for their staff. They have barriers up at the front desk and pen isolation. In the amount of time I was there I never once saw a counter cleaned where patients laid their belongings to check in. The clip boards that was provided to us with a pen attached was not cleaned when I gave it back. Unfortunately this is the preferred radiology place for my insurance.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<username>Sheree Swan< /username><Time>1596307138277< /Time><rate>1< /rate><review>I've been trying for days to get in for a pre OP x ray. They don't schedule for xray appointments however which leaves you with either long waits, having the girl who answers the phone send you in circles leading right back to herself, or just not having service provided. It's pretty much been a nightmare anytime I've had to go here, which unfortunately over the last 2 years has been a lot. Understaffed and poorly managed. A prime example as to why healthcare facilities should have max caps on profits and have to reinvest the rest back into their facilities to provide better healthcare.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea43da4fa050cd:0x3a23b3fec2aec522< /gmap_id></record>

My doctor scheduled the appointment and the lady told my dr my apt was 1230 but to arrive 20 min early. .. i got there by 12 and was the only one in there for 45 min. Then 3 people came after me and were called right back... once i asked how much longer the lady was very rude and said your appointment was at 1 so not my fault you were early. I said i was told 1230 not 1.<//Text>

It was very crowded. My mask fell out of my pocket. They offered me a new one. As busy as it was the staff was very polite and helpful. Apologizing for the wait, but any rational person would of figured out it was busy and the staff did their jobs well. My dr put the wrong foot down. The front desk girl saw it was the wrong foot  called the dr to get the right foot x-rayed.
Thanks</review>

MRI Tech called me back and referred to me as "Miss"  (I'm 6'4" with a Goatee) After being over an hour into this, I'm left laying in the MRI Machine without anything being accomplished for 15mins. to be told they are Still Working on Fixing the  Paperwork.

<text>While the Ultrasound tech was very nice the follow up in this office was/is terrible. I had an out of state prescription and my results needed to be sent home. I made a follow call on the Friday after my US. The staff member I spoke to assured me the results had been faxed prior to 12/20/19. When I arrived for my annual visit on 12/24/19 they had not received the report.  When I arrived to the same office for follow up on 12/277/19 the report STILL had not arrived. I then called again requesting the report be faxed. The woman on the phone was very curt and did not apologize for these issues. Your company is in the healthCARE industry,  Perhaps some customer service and ability to follow through should be emphasized in your training.
I have now been sitting at my doctors office for 25 minutes and they still have not received the fax. Thankfully I am only temporarily in Bakersfield where I am a traveler in the healthcare industry and don’t have to regularly rely on this company.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>My mother was treated poorly in this place by a lady named Belinda. We waited three weeks for a scheduled appointment which I understood but my mother needed to get a mammogram done (since she was experiencing some irregularities and pain). Went to her appointment this day and Belinda told my mother she couldn’t get it done as it was scheduled incorrectly (routine mammogram) when I reality I called to schedule and let them know it was a referral from her doctor. Belinda talked poorly and her attitude was terrible. I don’t see how people like that can be working in this field knowing they will be dealing with clients. The other staff was friendly and trying to do everything possible to the exam but apparently Belinda had final word.  Will not be scheduling in this radiology again.< /review><Rating>1<//Rating>< pics>

My appt was 11:15am. I got there at 11:00am.  They didn't take me back for ultrasound until 12:05pm. That's my only complaint.  The front office staff and tech were very friendly.</text>

<Review>I arrived before my 8:40 appointment time to be told I had been called to be let known my 8:40 appointment would be 20-30 minutes late. They said it went to voicemail and it said my voicemail box hadn't been set up. Which is not true. But an hour and 40 minutes past 8:40 I still was waiting. There excuse was they had tried to call.. That was fa 20-30 minute delay not the hour and 40 minute delay I endures</Review>< gmapID>

<Review>I have never had a bad experience here. This facility is usually fast and efficient and the imaging staff is very competent and pleasant (with the exception of the woman in the X-ray department. She has never smiled or interacted well with me at least).

The others on the imaging staff are very nice and I've had MRI'S, Mammograms, Ultrasounds and Catscans.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Extremely poor service by the the X-ray employee (a female)   I was there a few minutes past 5pm and I was asked to come back another time.  I really needed this done so the receptionist said I could stay. There were 4 people needing xrays in front of me. The X-ray tech got them in and out quickly but did not call me back for for X-ray until 30 minutes later after the other customers had left.  She gave me a lame excuse about the equipment not working correctly.  It was almost 7pm before I got out of there.  IF YOU DONT LIKE YOUT JOB WORK SONEWHERE. DIFFERENT!!!</text>

When I received a call to set appointment I asked what I would need to pay and I was told my co-pay would be due, then, when I arrive I am told payment of 205 is needed to meet my deductible. When I questioned this, the lady gets a tone and states she will have the supervisor “pull the call”. At that moment I didn’t think that was necessary until the lady continued to have this rude tone. I then asked her what the name of the supervisor that would listen to the call and her eyes got big! Then I moved into another waiting room where I sit for an hour. After one hour passes I get up and go back into the other room where I see “rude tone lady” and another employee. I inquire about the time as I needed to get back to work. I was told that my check in time was 3:00 and my scan time was 3:30; and the time was just after 4:00. The lady acts like she doesn’t know what time it was…. This place is a joke and I will forever and always tell anyone to go somewhere else.< /review>

<Review>Nurses and front receptionist were super nice and helpful.   The problem was when I was waiting in line with other patients and a Karen cuts in front of us and the receptionist helps her.
Other than that it was a great experience.</Review><Date>1622675012869< /Date>< gmap_id>

I came in for an MRI of my ankle and the ladies in the front were friendly and worked fast because I was able to complete the forms on my phone before my appointment. The MRI technician made me fe comfortable when providing me with a warm blanket and answered all the questions I had.< /review><userid>103306400041939165519</userid>< Response>
