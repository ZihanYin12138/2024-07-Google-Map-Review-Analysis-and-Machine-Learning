< Review>
I went in I want to say about 3 weeks ago
And employee Yolanda helped me. Wow just wow she is awesome! I had a list of questions when I walked in the store keep in mind I went in only to get my questions answered and I walked out with a brand new awesome iPhone thank to Yolanda!!! I went in again last week and she was not there I was disappointed I asked for her and a girl said she didn’t work there anymore. So sad because she is one of the best person I’ve made business with.<//Review>

I was initially pleased with the service until I found Yolanda created a fake gmail acct with my name and rated herself, giving herself 5 stars for being so amazing. I don’t care for fraudulent reviews. That is dishonest.</text>

One day I walked into the store looking around and the first thing I came into was a greet by Maria. She helped me switch over to cricket and now I save a lot more on my family plan. Thanks to her and her customer service! I've gone there before and never saw her, but thanks to her again she saved me money!< /Text>

<Review>Terrible experience with this store...the woman working opened and started putting a screen protector on my phone without me authorizing it and when I asked what she was doing and how much it was she told me it was amazing and worth $42 because if it broke I could exchange it...when it broke within a week and I went to return it I was told I had the wrong receipt...the only receipt they gave me with tempered glass and an order number and bar code on the top.<//Review>< time>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I have three months with the plan .... The first to buy the phone and acquire the service and two to pay for the plan ... The first time everything very well, very friendly lady, direct and fast treatment ... But the others Twice awful late and they made me pay for insurance that I never asked for .... Get well informed and ask for their status with details because the employees don't inform you anything ...

Tengo tres meses con el plan.... La primera a comprar el teléfono y adquirir el servicio y dos a pagar el plan... La primera vez todo muy bien, señorita muy amable, trato directo y rápido... Pero las otras dos veces horrible de tardado y me hicieron pagar un seguro que nunca pedí.... Infórmese bien y pidan su estado con detalles porque las empleadas no te informan nada...< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I genuinely like this little hole-in-the-wall. The food is authentic, the salsa they offer with chips is good, not spicy, but zesty. It is definitely overshadowed by the salsa they serve with your food. I think it's amazing; it has hints of smoke, and it's pretty spicy, but not overpowering. My favorite plate is the Carne En Su Jugo, take it from me, you can't go wrong.<//review>

<Text>Luv that they serve Menudo everyday. And it is very tasty. Tortillas seem to be hand made. Prices are very reasonable.< /Text>< user>

I had a carnitas burrito and a can of soda . Did not come with rice and beans, only hard chips which i didn't eat. The carnitas meat was dry and hard which tells me it's not fresh. There was only one server and the place was real busy. For $11,  all I got was a burrito and one soda. There are better choices in this town.< /text>

I've ordered from here 3 times only because it's close to my job. But the service from the old woman with black hair, (which I'm guessing is the owner) is horrible. You would think she'd be glad that people actually give her business but she's a rude witch who needs lessons in customer service. Don't recommend at all.< /review>

My family and I have been going to Dr. Uma for over 2 years. She is a very humble and great dentist and has a wonderful staff. We were looking braces for my 13 yr son and we came to know that she is very experienced , so we visited and finally we got what we were looking. Last 2 years we are visiting to her clinic for any dental related work without second thought.
Last but not least the staff is wonderful, very helpful. This was my best experience ever, I would definitely recommend to others.</Text>

Dr. Patel and her entire staff is very professional and helpful.  My husband and I have been going to her for the last couple of years and she is amazing. She always takes time to explain the procedures, answers all our questions and never tries to rush through patients. As someone who has always been scared of doctors,  Dr. Patel and everyone in her practice made me feel comfortable and safe. She is very capable and her team is very well trained. Special shout out to Charleen for always making my experience a good one! I have had to see Dr. Patel multiple times during this last year for Invisalign treatment but even during Covid times, I have always felt safe here. I would highly recommend her.<//review>

Great experience and great service! I have been visiting Star dental for 2 yrs now. The service, professionalism, expertise of the doctor and her team has been exceptional. Dr. Uma Patel is very gentle in her approach & procedures which takes away a lot of anxiety and provides honest evaluation of dental problems/diagnosis. I highly recommend Star Dental's entire team to anyone who is looking for a fantastic dentist for all of dental problems!<//text>

Dr.Uma is like an artist when she works on your teeth. I have great confidence in her ability and experience. Her pleasant attitude makes you forget why you are there. I hate going to dentist generally but with Uma it is a completely different experience. I look forward to seeing her.
Sharlene her staff is cherry on the cake and very easy to deal with. I recommend others to experience this when needed.< /Review>

Dr. Uma Patel is the best dentist ever! My wife and I started seeing Dr. Patel about 2 years now and we are glad to be part of Dr. Patel’s dental family. We were recommended by one of our family friends who is with Dr. Patel since last 10 years. She is patient-centric and builds long lasting relationship.
She is very persistent, listens to her patients, extremely knowledgeable and performs dental procedures with an excellency.
My wife recently had her two implants done and both went very smoothly. Before the surgery we met with her and she thoroughly explained us what the procedure is and what to expect after its completed. She has tremendous amount of experience which puts you at ease. She takes really good care of her patients and is truly exceptional in every way. Nevertheless her staff is very accommodating and friendly. She and her team are amazing and we will continue to go there and would highly recommend Dr. Uma Patel to anyone.<//Text>

<text>Dr. Uma Patel is very good and caring doctor that I have seen. She handled me and my family very patiently and did her job wonderfully and she  exceeded my expectations. Few years before I had a severe problem in my tooth and when I went to her she did orthodontic procedure very well.

Dr Uma Patel is Amazing! Fast, professional, explains the process and gives detailed diagnosis and advice on best treatment options. She explained all issues to me in a calm manner, alleviating any anxiety I might have. Financing staff were clear in explaining my share of cost and were flexible with my schedule to arrange follow-up appointments. Very highly recommend!< /review>

I have had extensive dental work done throughout my life. Many dentists, office staff and dental assistants to deal with. Billing issues, bad and good throughout the years. I can say they are the best  by far. They are very welcoming and do great work. No one likes to go to the dentist  but if I had a dental business I would want it to be like this! Honest, fair, welcoming and great customer service! Star dental is great place to go for great work, service and a friendly environment. They all smile and love there work.< /Review>

Great staff! Dr. Patel made me feel extremely comfortable. She spent time with me showing step-by-step implant procedure. And more importantly procedure was done very nicely and now my front teeth looks amazing, I would highly recommend Dr. Uma Patel to anyone for implants. Her fees are lowest compared to other dentist in the area too for whole procedure, I spent some time comparing details implants with and without crowns, etc...<//review>

Finally I reached here to Dr. Uma Patel, I never had to check with any other dentist anymore. She is so nice and friendly. She has done a wonderful job on my braces. After almost 1 year, last Tuesday, Doctor took of my braces and I was so surprised to see the result. I am so happy to see my teeth straight and beautiful. All the staffs and assistants are very friendly. I strongly recommend them :) :) :)<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Great experience and great service ! I am visiting Star dental for 4 yrs for cleaning, crown, invisalign & the service, professionalism, expertise by the doctor and her team has been great.
Dr. Uma Patel is very gentle in her approach & procedures which takes away a lot of anxiety. She also fits well to my dental needs versus costs while keeping the fees very reasonable. I highly recommend Star Dental's entire team  !!< /Text>

Definitely 5 stars for Dr. Uma Patel. I recommend her for anyone seeking an all-around great dental experience. The staff is friendly and very efficient in resolving all types of issues. The facilities are great. And most of all, Dr. Patel is an excellent dentist. She provides compassionate care and the dental work is top notch. I always feel great when I walk out of her office. I have been going to her for years, and so have many people I have referred to her. The dental procedures so far have gone smoothly.</Review>

I strongly recommend Dr Uma and her clinic for your routine dental needs.

This was my first experience visiting her clinic along with my Mom, who is travelling from India. Mom's two teeth crown came off and it was an urgent situation so we walked into this clinic without prior appointment.

The receptionist was busy however it took her less than a minute to acknowledge and got us checked-in right away. The staff is really nice - quietly runs the clinic operations in the background and is almost invisible; clinic is super clean and professional; most importantly, Dr Uma is an Expert at what she does and has been around for over a decade! Both me and Mom felt, we were in good hands and could leave a Docs job to a Doc! It took her 20-min to take care of it and during the process, Doc was graceful & conversing with both of us - 'everything is under control'

Towards the end of our visit, I learnt that the receptionist, lost her 88-yr old grandmother yesterday; today she is at the clinic working and tomm she's at the funeral. My sincere condolences to her - Very sorry to hear about your mom and genuinely respect your commitment/dedication to this clinic.

Overall positive & spiritual vibes from this clinic and my Mom is all good. This is now my go to clinic for all family dental needs.</Text>

<review>Dr. Uma Patel have done my tooth implant plus crown, what a great dental experience.
All the works was done in time, very professionally and felt natural. Dr Uma Patel is very through and accommodating. I have visited her office for emergencies at the end of day for my tooth pain and she has stayed late to take care of my dental problem.

Dr Uma Patel is proficient, friendly and keep me informed during procedure which makes the whole dental experience stress free. even staff if friendly and efficient.

I was referred to her by coworker and who also found her one of the best dentist around.
I highly recommend her services for dental services.<//review>< pics>

I would like to share my experience with recent visit at Star Dental in Fremont California.

Dr. Patel is very calm, friendly and thorough in her work, I am very pleased with the dental treatment I received. She is the best Dentist I have seen so far in Fremont, CA

Good things I liked:
- Very clean, hi-tech and huge office, almost like a townhouse.
- Staff is very professional and friendly.

I would definitely recommend her to my friends and family, and I never want to see another dentist again!<//Text>

I would highly recommend Dr. Uma Patel for Implant Dentistry to anyone who needs any dental work. I personally received two implants. The appointment was set right away and I was pleased how fast and smooth everything went. First, Dr. Patel explained how implants should be placed after panaromic x-ray was taken... The price for both implants was much less than I was offered at several other places. Dr. Uma Patel personally placed my both the implant, and she is very professional and meticulous.

The crowns were also placed very professionally without much pain.  Since I was impressed with Dr. Patel's work, I brought my daughter  here too for Invisalign. Dr. Patel took care of that too at very reasonable rate compared to other I consulted in the neighborhood. I’m very glad that I found Dr. Patel.

Dr. Uma Patel and staff Charleen here are very professional and they provide excellent service.<//Text>

Star Dental in Fremont is absolutely the best dental office in the bay area. Dr. Patel is very professional and spent a lot of time explaining what treatment I need, and provided me with educational materials that helped me to understand my situation clearly, and made decision based on facts. Front receptionist in the front were very polite and helpful too, no wait time, the assistant -Charleen was very courteous and made me feel that i was well taken care of. They also checked my insurance coverage and provided me different options. All in all, I was really pleased on how they provided me the best patient care that I ever experienced! Thank you Dr. Patel and staff, I recommend Dr. Patel patients who are looking for good dentist in fremont.< /review>

It is strange to love your dentist but I do. All I can say is that everyone is very friendly and accommodating. Dr.  Patel and her staff did great job for my orthodontic braces. They don't leave you in waiting room for ever and they are always willing to squeeze me in as needed.

My experience is always great! Going to the orthodontist is not anyone's favorite thing,  but I am very pleasantly surprised with professional treatment with Dr. Patel

Since we had such a positive experience,  so now my husband has started tooth Implant and so far almost no pain and performed very smooth procedure. Thanks to Dr.  Patel and staff!</text>

I would definitely recommend Dr. Patel and her wonderful staff to anyone looking for a dentist or looking to change dentists.  Dr. Patel is such a caring, gentle person and a very skilled and knowledgeable dentist.  I no longer live or work in the immediate area, but I choose to continue coming to Dr. Patel and traveling.  The staff is great about accommodating my schedule when it comes to making appointments.  I still have my wisdom teeth and recently one of them broke.  I was told it was too broken to repair or to try a crown...it had to be extracted.  I think Dr. Patel sensed that I was a little stressed over an extraction.  She went ahead and offered to try to and repair the tooth by filling it.  She not only tried once, but twice.  The break in the tooth was too big and both times the filling wouldn't keep.  After the 2nd time, I made the appointment for the extraction.  The procedure went well, virtually no pain!  Dr Patel had me in and out in less than an hour and it's healing fine!  Thank you Dr. Patel, you knew my wisdom tooth had to come out....but you still tried to save it anyway, twice ...just so I wouldn't stress over the extraction.<//review>

<review>I really loved it and will definitely recommend to my friends and relatives. Dr. Patel is very professional, and excellent Dentist!, the staff are very nice and the facility is very clean. From my previous experienced with other Dentist, after the routine cleaning they will schedule you for the procedure that needs to be done, but with Star Dental they accommodated my request to proceed with the procedure because I was really in pain, the made it possible and squeezed me in their schedule that same date and time. They really took good care of me that day and I loved how Dr. Patel. When I went back today for the permanent crown, the more that I was convinced that Dr. Patel and staff are very professional. Thank you Dr. Patel for accommodating me, you took the pain away immediately :) Thank you to the staff too for being patient and nice :)<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

To sum up my experience with Dr. Uma and her office – I find them efficient, professional, trustworthy and accommodating.  In my latest good experience with them, I had a situation that I was travelling out of country and one of my tooth starting giving me trouble just before I had to fly and on top of that it was a Sunday. I called and left message describing my situation. To my pleasant surprise, I got a call back soon and Dr. fixed my tooth on Sunday morning at 9 a m just before my flight. I reached at nine ready to wait for her but no, I didn’t have to wait as she was there right on time. She had adjusted my need in her personal time. And I feel wonderful  and happy to have them in my neighborhood and would recommend them to my friends with great pleasure.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I found Dentist Dr. Uma Patel and the entire staff who worked on my root canals, (2 of them) along with the porcelain crowns, to be very accomodating & very professional. They were very understanding & sympathetic about my pain I was having with my teeth. They took the time to explain everything they were going to do and gave me several options. I highly recommend this dentist for your dental needs.</Review>

I got my root canal done in 2013 and doctor did awesome work, it was perfect and no issues.  I like office which is big, clean and location is very good. I do visit frequently for my family needs and I would strongly recommend this place for any dentist needs.< /review>

She has worked on my implant and implant crown cap. And I am very impressed that everthing she has done never caused me pain and found her to be very professional. Also my whole family is very impressed with professional oral hygiene care Dr. Patel for past many years. Charleen in front is very prompt and easy to schedule appointments. Thanks Dr. Patel & Staff for providing great service!< /Review>< pictures>

I have been very lucky to have Dr. Uma Patel as my dentist for a very long time. I had a few cavities and she filled up all my cavities with the right amount of filling material with ease and precision. I haven't had to do the filling again since she fixed all my cavities. Her staff is so flexible and they will adjust the appointment dates as per your availability. My friends also go there for root canal, fixed broken teeth, crown and teeth cleaning. She also educate us and explain everything ( X-rays) before the treatment. I would highly highly recommend her for any kind of dental problems.< /Review>

<Text>Star Dental is by far the best dentist I have ever been to. Dr. Patel and her staff are amazing. Sharlene the dental assistant is very sweet and helps me and my husband Brian at each visit. We live in San Leandro but don't mind the drive for the service we receive here. We just got our Invisalign put on today and we can't wait for the results. Thanks Star Dental for helping us with our smile!<//Text>< pictures>

Doctor and staff are friendly and very comfortable and their service is excellent. Initially I was only taking my kid for regular check ups, but later everyone in my family started liking and now this is the place to go for my family for all dental treatments and checkups.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I was looking for a new dentist in Fremont. With Dr. Uma Patel, I did not find any reviews on Yelp but I did find a lot of great reviews on other sites and though she looks very young from the picture I decided to try her. The first time I went to her, she took my x-rays and came up with a treatment plan and patiently explained to me why a certain treatment was required. She spoke to me about my budget and how much I could afford to spend this year and priorotized treatment accordingly. This was something that impressed me the most cause she respected my financial situation and was willing to work with me. She told me upfront that I needed a crown and a few re-fillings and what the cost would be. In just 1 month, she did my crown and 3 other teeth.

Dr. Uma Patel is very skilled, dedicated and quick with an experience of 10+ years (Dont let her looks fool you). She did a great job with my teeth and my bite was perfect everytime. She and her staff are very friendly and appointments are easy to get. Good dentists are difficult to find and I almost did not want to share her. But reviews have helped me before and I hope this will help someone else discover Dentist in Fremont – Dr Uma Patel (Star Dental).</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fbf5de1c21537:0x956c7b80a193ed5f<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Star Dental - Dr Uma Patel.
Are you sacred of the dentist, if yes, you ought to visit Dr Uma Patel who is based out in Fremont,CA.
She is highly skilled , professional and apt at her work.She does the initial analysis and gives you options with your treatment and timeline.
As described by other reviewers she does not force upon any treatment and also does not scare you with the condition of your tooth/gums.
She patiently listens to you and explains in depth the cause of your problem.I have been umteen times to her clinic and have always received a wonderful service.
And not to mention the staff, they are worth equally appreciation.
All in all, you will not find it as a conventional dental clinic because of the friendly,skillful and adjusting behaviour of the doctor and her staff.
I hightly recommend to everyone to try this doctor atleast with regular cleaning and know for yourself.<//text></record>

I was told to come back at a specific time then told again to come back, again, still had a wait. Seemed pricier than other places I have been even with a $10 off coupon. Just one guy, doing it all. I'll look around next time.< /Text>

<review>The best place I've ever gotten smog done. Took less than 30 minutes. The person who helped me had amazing customer service. I brought a coupon and the price was still lower than what I expected. I will come back here to do my smog every 2 years. I only wish I would have come here sooner!<//review>< user>

The very best in Riverside, friendly and great service. Have been bring all my car here for years. Try others trying to go really cheap, big mistake. Came back to M & T for their honest, the savings on my car repairs was well worth my return...like I said at the first, M & T take care of my last 4 or 5 cars...
M & T take good care of me and my cars....Thank You for your honest service....<//Text>

Location is fine.  Service is acceptable.  Time frame from dropping it off to picking it up, as a Star location, is good.  Price is standard and they had me in their data base from a prior visit so just drop off the keys and go.</review>

Worst place EVER! The owners will be very friendly when they are not busy, but if it gets busy beware! I was just like the rest of the reviews here stating customer service is great until the owner said he would not redeem my coupon because I did not have it with me. I told him I've been coming here for years and told all my friends and family about your shop, he did not care and told me "Oh Well". Just a heads up< /text>

The shop is clean and professional. It was very busy when I first arrived and I did make an appointment to come back another time which they took me right in. Took about 20 minutes (typical for a smog check) and I was on my way. Friendly guys. One of the few STAR smog test facilities around and I recommend going here.< /Text>

<Text>Robert, the owner, was very helpful, knowledgeable, courteous, and professional.  He had me smog certified with 20 minutes of my arrival.  I was referred to Robert by Menno, the owner of Gerl's Muffler & Brake, who highly recommended Robert and his smog check business.

Thanks for the 5 STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE Robert.....👊👊👊.....👍< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

When a business states it will be open at 9am it should be open at 9am. I called the day prior and scheduled a smog at 9am for my motorhome and drove down to there shop to get the smog done and waited till 9:45am and no one had shown up. Thanks for waiting my time and gas.</text>

On a Monday, I would expect most smog places to open at 8am or 9am. It's 9:35am right now, and I called and got a weird answering machine. So maybe they're busy, but based on the other review I think I'll avoid this place.</Review>

I go too 2 Donut Cafe the one in San leandro, Ca. was like all the others sandwich, tea, breakfast. I notice in pass that is temp closed.

If you go there enough times they will remember you and what you like and begin to suggest it when you come in. If there’s no fresh coffee by the benches they’ll pour you some fresh coffee right over the counter! Prices are fair</Text>

<Text>The donuts are $3 a piece, and they are dry, probably because it's all vegan.  The also have flyers supporting terrorists, or at least for donations to people who are being charged under federal terrorism laws.  I guess you come here for the politics and not the food.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

<name>Eunice< /name><Date>1602222862867<//Date><Rating>5< /Rating><review>One of the things I really missed during the pandemic was really really GOOD sushi omakase while sitting at a traditional tiny sushi joint. This is one of three I really wanted to try since before the shutdown. It came highly recommended by my Japanese foodie friends. Glad I was in the area and their only outdoor table was available for dinner time. Oishii desu ka!! Fresh & delicious.
Oh they house-made their sushi shoyu!! Reservation is recommended as they are really tiny. Otherwise, you can order for contactless pick up or delivery.  Note: This is an traditional, old school, Japanese sushi joint. In Japan culture, Sushi is serious. Service was warm & kind. This place reminds me the unassuming, tiny sushi joints in Japan.

< Review>
Good nigiri sushi selection. The $150 omakase I had was good, however, the last few courses (i.e., the abalone) was a charred on the outside, and a bit cool in the middle. The chef is quite a character. I would recommend just having nigiri sushi and save your money on the omakase. It's not worth the price. Focus instead on the nigiri selections.</Review>

This place has a great lunch! For $16 you can get soup, salad and a good amount of sushi. This is the perfect lunch meeting spot if you are on a budget in Beverly Hills. The fish is fresh and although during dinner the prices are much higher I always go to lunch to get the best deal. The service is also usually very good and quick so you can be in and out in a very reasonable time during the work day.</Text>

Always such a solid meal.  Eating at the Bar is a must.  If you're not sure what to get, just go for the omakase!!!  Reasonable prices for what you get. Traditional style, none of that fusion hipster stuff.< /review>

<Text>Top shelf AUTHENTIC Japanese sushi.  Fish is flown in from Japan.  Don't expect crazy rolls.  The chef prepares the dishes with the correct amount of seasoning, you don't add your own wasabi.  They will instruct you when to use soy sauce or not.  But it's all worth it because the food is amazing.  What an experience.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80c2bbfb8f13fa2f:0x965d14e5ef86de73</gmap_id></record>

We have tried pretty much every sushi restaurant in LA. Sushi sushi had been top 5 but last visit was quite disappointing. Their omakase had been excellent in past despite lack of much change, but this time, food was coming out too fast to point dishes are sitting. As a result, quality as affected. This should not happen when you are spending this much.<//Review>

Unreal lunch special. This is THE place to get sushi for lunch in Beverly Hills if not all of LA. Underrated and hidden gem. Expensive spot for dinner with a $150 pp Omakase but they have a $16 lunch special with multiple options. Crazy. I get the Nigiri combo every time - miso, salad 5 piece assorted sushi + 6 piece cut roll

The fish here easily rivals Sugarfish. It’s so good. Just melts in your mouth. Traditional Japanese style with warm sushi rice. I’m tired of going to sushi restaurants, even some expensive ones that serve cold rice with their rolls. Totally different experience.

Don’t come to this restaurant if you want: California rolls, spicy tuna, eel sauce, spicy mayo, tempura etc. This is traditional Japanese sushi, come for the fish.

Even the wasabi is fresh! They mash fresh wasabi root every morning, that’s not a cheap process. So if you’re surprised there isn’t an excess of wasabi on your plate that’s why. They’ll give you extra, you just have to ask.<//text>

My girlfriend needed a fork and they didn’t have one. How are kids supposed to eat if they don’t know how to use chopsticks? Chefs use hands without gloves when preparing food. Extremely rude waitress.</review>

<Review>Incredibly amazing! Hands down THE BEST and is now MY favorite sushi restaurant in LA.

Having Sushi Sushi bookmarked for quite awhile now; co workers and I were able to clear our schedule and come in for lunch.

Sushi Sushi is located on Beverly Dr. in the city of Beverly Hills. Traffic is always heavy and parking can be a pain. Lucky for us we came right before the lunch crowd and scored a metered spot across from the restaurant. Meter accepts coins and credit cards!

The restaurant is very traditional and has that Japanese authentic feel. Warm towels were given at the beginning and end of our meal.

The premium sushi combo ($24) is the best deal on their menu and served only during lunch.
The premium sushi combo comes with a shitake mushroom miso, salad with pieces of fresh mackerel, 8 pieces of sushi and a toro cut roll. The 8 pieces are chef's choice so it changes daily. I was glad mine came with toro, sweet shrimp, and eel.

The quality of the fish was outstanding. Service was impeccable. No complaints at all.

I'm now a fan! Thank you!< /Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The material was very fresh and delicious at a very reasonable price.
I was very impressed with the response of the server and the smile.
I want to visit again if I have a chance

<text>(Translated by Google) I think it's the best sushi restaurant worth visiting in LA. The price is reasonable and really delicious! And there's a great casual hospitality everywhere. .
There is a great menu at lunchtime.
Recommended for important anniversaries!

I’m not even a cake fan, but all the cakes Michelle’s produces are phenomenal.  Especially love their citrus poppyseed cake.  Probably the best cake in the area.< /review>

Cakes are so beautifully made and absolutely delicious. The location is right next to the prettiest event center (Tennessee Gardens). The staff are very helpful and knowledgeable about their menu! Love coming here and supporting a local Redlands business!!!< /Review>

<text>I have been going there for years I do love their cakes they take very special care with them they are delicious! however, the one star is because their cake tasting needs serious work, fold up chairs, no table to put the cake slices on  that you are tasting, paper plate with four servings of cake and no beverages whatsoever not even water and they charge $15 for that special service.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

We had a haunted mansion themed wedding and this cake 100% fit the bill. It even had hidden mickeys on it. When we defrosted it to eat at our 1 year anniversary I was just as excited to see the hidden Mickey and it still tasted amazing< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUhp8sLbfuSu4TWOyLp7FTHP8smsT4F4lngYao=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>Over priced. Rude staff. Owner does not do what she says. I will never come here again.  I ordered a cake for my neices baby shower. I asked if taking it up the mountain the day before the shower was a good idea. I was assured that it was ok. I gave a picture of what I wanted. I paid $150. When we picked up the cake, we were surprised that it was not as we had requested. And Gray that we requested was purple. When we questioned the staff, and ask them to fix their error , Heather, was extremely rude. She asked us if we realized how much time it took them make the cake and the fondant pieces. When we questioned them about the color of the gray fondant pieces we were told that it was because of the lighting in the shop. However when we went outside it was still purple. Michelle, the owner came out for a bit and told her she could fix the mustache but the grey was the grey that they had. She said she would explain that to her staff that they needed to make other people aware of that. We took the cake up the mountain, and on the way up the of the cake begin to bubble and crack. We had specifically been told by Michelle to make sure that we put the cake in the refrigerator after 2 hours. We did. When we took the cake out in the morning it was all cracked and the died on the fondant had bled. I called the shop no answer back. I emailed Michelle directly, she initially did not offer me anything then offered to give me 20% back. The cake alone was $82. I told her I should have been reimbursed for the fondant. Michelle asked for my address to send me my refund of $27. It's been over 6 months and she has never sent me my refund. I will never go here again and I do not recommend that anyone use Michelles. Her staff is rude. You dont get what you ask for.<//review><Time>1510983901069</Time><username>KAREN KELLN< /username><rating>1<//rating>< gmapID>

Wow what a cake!!! Got German Chocolate and it was to die for! We help find lost pets and we got this cake after a search in Riverside. There were a handful to choose from. They didn't answer their phone, and voicemail was full. I told the staff about it and they said they didn't know how to get the voicemail!! Seriously? Figure it out!! But the cake was fabulous. Management? Puzzling.< /review>

We had our wedding cake done here 8 years ago and although it's not frequently I always try to make it back over and get an 8 inch of the same flavor for special occasions. ....the flavor never disappoints....it always takes me back to that moment at our reception when we took that first bite...parking is challenging but I remember when the store itself was even tinier so I expect that they will change that parking concern in time as well .....< /text>

Last minute long shot to get a birthday cake for our daughter on a tip from a friend. Not only did they have cakes but this unique orange poppy seed (which our daughter is obsessed over) on hand. They write a custom birthday message, we paid and were on our way. Now eating the cake was something else. Never had such a dense yet delicious cake. I kept saying it was solid. It held up with every slice even though it was only an 8". Wow! We didn't waste one bite. Thanks Michelle's!</Text>

<Text>Words cannot easily describe the majestic and supple cakes of legend here.  The Raspberry Victorian is phenomenal.  I almost hate cake, but the slices of heaven here can calm even the biggest cake hater.  It's that good.  So light, not to sweet, and every delicate flavor is discernable.  Stop in and get you some.< /Text>< response>

Michelle's di my wedding cake and it was exactly what we wanted. We enjoyed the tasting and they explained everything great. We already had a designed picked out for the cake and they were able to pull it off! Everything was delivered on time and was delicious. As a bride they were great to work with, I never had to worry about anything with them.<//text>

I was referred here by a friend and walked in to potentially use this bakery for my wedding cake, they where rude right from the beginning, the lady said I needed an appointment to taste the cake but I just wanted to buy some cupcakes and decide from there as my wedding was in 3 weeks and had no time for cake tasting. The cupcakes are expensive and only have a handful of choices. I left and went down the street to a much better bakery.<//review>

Michelle’s cakes are very delicious, but their customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  When I arrived to pick up the baby shower cake I ordered, it looked nothing like I ordered (including colors and the picture from their website). I had to wait a half hour for them to salvage it.  It looked a tad better, but was still not what I ordered.<//Review>

I was nervous about meeting with them because I didn't know what I wanted. Cake tasting went great and decided on a design. Months later I decided to change the design to our aviation theme and they were very easy to work with. Wedding day came and they nailed it! Design was great and tasted even better!

<rating>2< /rating><Text>The following review is about our entire experience with Michelle's Bakery for our wedding at Serendipity Garden Weddings this past October.

The cake tasting experience was a huge disappointment. We communicated w/ Michelle’s bakery on multiple occasions describing what we wanted to try before our meeting since we were coming from out of state, and asked for two specific flavors - red velvet and chocolate peanut butter. When we got there, they put us into a small corner against a wall, not facing each other. A worker brought us out 6 slices of cake on a styrofoam plate with one plastic fork, and none of the flavors were the specific two we asked for. When told the worker that we had called prior to this visit to confirm the flavors that we wanted to try, she said that it wouldn’t be possible to make the peanut butter chocolate cake. I asked to speak with chef who said he could whip it up in 15-20 minutes, which delayed our experience.

We asked for red velvet and and peanut butter chocolate cupcakes. We told the worker that we did not want the white frosting that comes with the peanut butter chocolate cupcakes, but rather wanted peanut butter icing on them when we came to do the cake testing. We also said that we did not want any of the cupcakes to be cream filled. She confirmed that they would be able to do this for us. Unfortunately at the wedding the cupcakes had the white frosting on the peanut butter chocolate cupcakes and both of the types of cupcakes were cream filled.

They unfortunately got our cake design wrong, despite us sending them a picture two different times of the cake we wanted to emulate. My husband and I came to a compromise on the cake, and what I specifically wanted was the middle layer to be a naked cake with white frosting. Unfortunately the middle layer was the same pink pearlized layer as the top part of the cake, which really disappointed me.

Michelle’s bakery texted Brian two days before our wedding, for instructions for our cake design. Again the description of our cake was given and the result was still wrong. We were surprised that they were contacting us to confirm these details just two days before our big day when we felt we had been over this multiple times with them.

It was obvious throughout the whole process that there likely weren’t very good notes/any notes at all describing what we wanted for our cake/cupcakes whether it was through calling before our first appointment, talking with them again at our appointment, or afterwards through email and text as everything turned out so wrong.

On a positive note, the day of, and the day if our cake tasting, everything tasted great!< /Text>< pictures>

The quality of cakes here is amazing! I come here at least once a month to order cakes for clients and our clients are always happy with them. The only thing is that the service of staff isn't always super great. Sometimes they make you wait for a while. But its worth it for the awesome cakes!</Review>

Parking for this place is a bit odd, the grounds are unkempt, greenery growing over curbs. Once inside we were greeted by the staff, I came in with my toddler and asked if there was a restroom we could use and they said no. :/ We bought a few slices to taste and left quickly because.... my toddler's bladder is more important.  On the way out of the parking area there were some 2x4's being used as a speed bump? I had heard of this place from a friend but I must admit that I want impressed.  Guess I'll have to drive to Porto's in Downey.< /Review>

The tasting was enough to sell my husband on me on Michelle's bakery--the most delicious cake either of us had ever tasted! Our wedding guests were raving about how good it was, too. The team at Michelle's was very helpful and great with customization: we had a three tier cake with the top and bottom layers circles and the middle layer square. We also had different flavors for each layer: highly recommend their raspberry victorian, toffee, and lemon. You really can't go wrong with this bakery!</Text>

Best bakery in the area for European style cake, not too sweet, but very rich.  It's pretty pricey though.  You get what you pay for right?<//review>

Michelle's Bakery is the best cake I have ever tried. Once I tried their cake, I could never go anywhere else. The Victoria cream in the cake is so good and the cake is always very moist. They are always very helpful and so sweet.< /Text>

There is no question to the quality of cakes or design skills at Michelle's. These are European style cakes, so they are decadent, dense, and moist. The flavors are unique and the quality of these cakes are miles above the competition in my opinion. I've had the pleasure of tasting cakes from some of the biggest named bakeries in LA, OC, and NY in my past days working in the wedding business and to me none really have rivaled Michelle's. The "Victorian" variety of cakes and triple chocolate cake are truly superb. They are the work of a true master pastry chef and when you consider the prices there really isn't a better choice to be made. The ONLY reason I cannot give 5 stars pertains to the customer service. I've had no problems personally with Michelle's mother but it is evident that one must tread lightly around her. Michelle herself is delightful but I have witnessed the cross, rude manner of her mother directly with other clients on more than one occasion in my many visits to this bakery. I have not seen this affect the bakery's ability to meet the demands of their business so I can see why many people continue to patron Michelle's in spite of many poor customer service reviews. I will always recommend this bakery and simply warn people not to be put off by the not-so-friendly woman manning the phone and counter. However my personal opinion is that there is no room for ungracious, impolite behavior in the wedding industry. For many women it's the one and only time in their lives that they get to feel like the a super special and important person and they should be treated as such.   I would not be surprised to learn that Michelle's is flourishing in spite of poor customer service because the quality of her cakes sell themselves. I do believe her business could skyrocket though with a little warmth and gratitude coming from the front of the house where mom appears to run the show.<//Review>

Love their cakes and treats.  They are clearly working on their service but it still needs some work. The strawberry filling was quite tasty but the way they do tastings for an expensive wedding cake leaves room for improvement.<//Review>

<review>Ugliest website I have ever seen, you cannot even make an order from it. This is 2015, your website is your first impression more than 50%of the time. How can I expect my cake to be beautiful if you are willing to settle for such a hideous website. Fix your site and watch your business grow.<//review>< Date>

<Text>Michelle's bakery did my wedding cake and they told me they could do anything; just bring in a picture. Well this was definitely NOT the case. It tasted great, I will give them that, but it looked NOTHING like the picture I provided. It was very disappointing and looked like a very lazy, poor duplication. The picture I gave them was a very basic, traditional cake, nothing complicated. They left out a ton of detail and told me there would be different shades of ivory on it and when it arrived it was all one solid color. The girl I worked with was very nice, she knew what I wanted; something that resembled my wedding dress which they had a picture of in my file. The worst part of it all was when I had my fiance drop off ribbon that was supposed to go around the cake, the guy at the counter had no idea what they were supposed to do with it and handed my fiance the file to find the picture of the cake himself; so he saw my wedding dress. At Michelle's, the right hand doesn't seem to know what the left is doing. If you're going for taste, choose them but don't get your hopes up about the way its going to look.</Text>< gmap_id>

<Text>OMG their cakes are incredible with some of the best fillings and chocolate on the service of this planet. The cakes are not inexpensive but worth every dime and even the small ones are dense enough to stop a 45 magnum at 20 yards so you get quite a few servings out of them. Never have had an issue with service in the 20+ years I purchased from them but I don't order through the internet as I am fortunate enough to live within a couple miles of this little bakery.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>LOVE this place, I've been going here for the past 10 years and the cakes never get old. Michelle's mom aka the old lady that people apparently hates is the sweetest funniest little thing. She's always so willing to help out any customer and so is the rest of the staff. I can honestly say I have never had any sort of problem with their customer service, or cakes. These cakes are well worth the drive all the way out to Redlands. To this day I will not have any other cakes besides Michelle's nothing comes close. P.S try the chocolate, on chocolate with raspberries its the BEST!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dcaa43b602d187:0xfa3bd13a379c7d39<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is by far the worst cake business ever in the San Bernardino area, first and for most horrible customer service. These women don't know how to operate a business and honor customer service  and let me tell you the cakes are pitiful. I do not recommend buying any wedding cakes, pastry,etc period.</Review>

<review>Hello I am having difficulties with Michelle's bakery in Redlands, Ca. I ordered a 2 tier cake and confirmed the details, with the sales representative on Saturday, Oct 13th. She had me sign an NCR form that details the specifications of the cake and I also provided a photo. The sales rep took my $80 deposit. Which was half of the $160 that was quoted. The event was cancelled the very next day. I called to inform the bakery and left a message on Monday as this bakery is not open on Mondays or Sundays, however I wanted to give notice as soon as possible. I could not find any documentation in writing on the NCR form or the receipt regarding their policy about cancellations or refunds. To follow through I called on Tuesday just to verify that my voicemail was received and that the Bakery was were aware that I cancelled the order. When I reached a sales associate she stated that they were not aware and I advised I left a message gave the date and time. The sales associate stated that they could cancel the order has it had not begun but my deposit would NOT be returned. I inquired as to why I could not receive my deposit back and she stated well that is just our policy. I asked where the policy is written and she said 'well we used to hand out a sheet, but we stopped but it has always been our policy". I said well why would you stop handing out that type of information. She replied that I could speak with owner and that she will leave her a message. I never received a return call. I called on Wednesday morning 8:24a.m. and another person answered and said that she doesn't know when the owner will be in and said she would leave her a message and the owner still did not return my calls. Finally, I visited the bakery on Thursday and the sales associate said she went to retrieve the owner and the owner told her she does not have time. I insisted to speak with the owner and she was VERY RUDE. She came out and said 'what do you need?!??!! I asked why my phone calls and messages were not returned and she said that voicemail box is full and doesn't get checked. I advise her the bakery policy was never explained, received nor was it in writing on any of my documents. I never saw or signed anything that stated no refunds and store credit only. . They are refusing to return my deposit and my receipt does not reflect any language regarding cancellations, deposits or refunds. She said that one of her staff will contact me and/or send me proof of a store credit. I asked when that would be and she said the person that handles store credits only works on Mondays. And told me it would come in the mail.  I asked how if you don't have my address. She looked annoyed and then curtly asked for my address. I wrote down my address as they did not have it. I still have not received my store credit. I would prefer my deposit returned. The two stars is because at least the sample cake was tasty but their business practices are very unorganized.</review>< Pics>

<Text>For starters, I just wanted to say I have never publicly complain about any business I purchased items from. This is the first time I've ever left a review. The only reason why I rated this place a one-star is because it would not allow me to rate it anything less. The service here is unbelievably bad. The people working there act as if they don't need you or want you as a customer. Needless to say we purchased a cake there for my daughters sweet 16 birthday party and it looked absolutely nothing like what we requested and the taste was just okay. ( I have including pictures of what the cake was supposed to look like and what it actually look like) Learn from my mistakes, save your money and time, do not use this Bakery.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Would have given less stars if I could! Horrible customer service! Who closes a business at 2pm?! You can't even get in to order a cake and the website does not work to order one and they won't give you prices over the phone! How in the world have you stayed open this long!?< /review>< name>

<Review>I recently ordered a cake for my daughters bday party I picked up the cake her name was spelled wrong so was asked to fix it Michelle's bakery tired once didn't look good so tired again then came out okay but they could have called me to verify the correct spelling of my daughters name but Michelle's bakery had failed to do so. So then came my daughters bday I served the cake and had a scary surprise of a full size all together BEE inside of her cake I was very unhappy knowing that ppl have already ate the cake. Over all I was very disappointed I will not countine my service at Michelle's bakery 😡< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Pricey, but if you have a favorite this is the go-to. At times it is a hit-and-miss for decorating.<//review>

Purely amazing people. Went there for the first time tonight and was delighted to interact with wonderful local people who are there to support the community. Such a positive experience, I must return and contribute energy to the space. 🙏🏼< /Text>

< Review>
This space is peaceful inside, warm and inviting. It's a gathering hall for members of the community to hold events. The acoustics are good, lots of floor space and chairs. There are two bathrooms with double stalls and wheelchair accessibility. There is a kitchen and a huge wraparound parking lot. I do not know the rental fee pricing.<//Review>

If zero stars were possible that would be my first choice. The bathrooms we're clogged before the party started and the Grange representative NEVER became available. We paid for a service and got riped off. Rent a different hall.< /text>

<Text>Great little patch of land between the 12 and the western B roads
Small yet comfortable hall space
Big kitchen for cooking meals and preparing drinks for entertainment

Out side location for mutli-prupose set up; from jungle gym and inflatable children's  play homes. Great from family or company gatherings.

<time>1623289338495< /time><rating>5< /rating><Review>Taylor Co Automotive has excellent service which is always my primary concern.  I don’t enjoy paying for car maintenance the same as anyone else but when I do, I like to have the peace of mind that I’m working with an honest crew that doesn’t try to sell me on things I don’t need.  The staff at Taylor Co. are very transparent, use technology to reinforce that transparency by showing me via a text or email what is happening with my vehicle and even includes a short video that explains why certain services are required.  I’ve never seen this level of transparency married with convenience at a mechanic shop before.  They really are First Class.  Premises are always clean, comfortable and people are friendly.  They all seem to have strong communication skills and Mike and Laura who helped me today really solidified why I come back to them because BMW maintenance is not cheap so at the very least I want to know I’m spending my money with people of integrity, high standard of quality and are willing to go the extra mile to provide superior customer service.  They always take good care of me and my vehicle.  They are just a First Class operation that has earned their positive reviews.  Keep up the excellent work guys!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1624921962978, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your great review Charles!

<Review>They run a few different shops on site, oil change, then a couple of service areas for different makes.  I went to the oil change side of the business - very clean, prompt, did a very good job/good price.  Spotted an issue (all digital with photos and detail).  went to the the service side of the company a few days later.  were honest, no fee -said the maintenance was not urgent and should wait until the next oil change.    Another shop said it had to be done sooner, appreciate the honesty and value.  I will bring my vehicle back next time around<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< GmapID>

< review>
I have never experienced this level of transparency in this industry before I came to Taylor Co. Held off until this past week to get the car looked at for some loud noise. Taylor Co offered to see me the day I was looking around to schedule an appointment and fixed the issues extremely fast (took about 3 business days, I was in no rush). Throughout the process I was given pictures of the damaged parts per request, timeline on what parts were getting ordered and a full breakdown of how much each repair would cost before approval. No ballparks and had ample time to check what the repairs should generally cost.There’s not even the slightest hum to the car now. Thank you Jeff, Miguel and others for your exceptional work I look forward to bringing my vehicle in again, hopefully next time for just some general maintenance.</review>

Awesome service, being that they were busy, I let Mike the manager know a car wash was not necessary, that I was content with the service tech using a duster.  Being a business owner myself, I appreciated when Mike insisted I receive a complimentary car wash following the completition of my service!< /Text>

<review>My 2010 Volkswagen GTIs engine light was going on and off all weekend long. I brought it in to this place and Mike found out what was going on with it within a couple hours. He told me that the intake manifold needed to be replaced and he also went ahead and called the local Volkswagen service center to see if I was still under warranty. Turns out I was and they would be able to fix it for me for free. Keep in mind Taylor Co didn't need to do that and I'm sure there are many repair shops that would charge for the repair without checking if still under the warranty. Taylor co saved me a ton of money through their honesty. I totally recommend them! They're very professional and honest.<//review><user>113927258288810548416<//user>< Resp>

Mike and Tom are awesome! They thoroughly checked my car and even told me about a recall item on my Fiat 500. I definitely recommend this shop!<//Text>

If I could give this company no stars I would. The issue is with workmen’s and how they handle everything. This company has told me no payments can be processed to come back the next day and then wana charge me a late fee . I had issue with them as well with automatic payments to avoid that issue and same thing happens I cancelled and then I look at my bank account and I see they withdraw money from my account .< /review>

Do not file your taxes here they advertised as 29 dollars in the end they will charge more than 100 for a simple form.  Plus some extra fees in total around 200.  I was a old customer and I had a good experience before but this year is so bad.<//Review>

<text>In the world of high end jewelry/watch shopping there's Davidson and Licht and then there's everyone else. From the moment the door is opened for you by a dapper gentleman who smiles and calls your attention to the hand sanitizer, to the champagne/scotch (or chilled bottled water if you prefer) and candied orange slices. This place is pure class without the pretentiousness which usually accompanies multi-million dollar jewelry caches and Rolex/Cartier Authorized Dealer status.

My wife and I spent at least two hours (probably closer to three) poring over various Rolex, Cartier and IWC watches and truly extravagant jewelry. Not once did we feel pressured to purchase. Not once did we encounter the "slickness" all too familiar in high end sales salons. What we did feel was supported and guided through our decision making process. To that end, we owe particular thanks to Orlando, his expertise and his patience. Aside from being a genuine and convivial fellow, it was clearly important to Orlando that our purchase was the right purchase for us. No pressure. No undue urgency tactics. He simply used his knowledge and experience to educate us about what we might like the most and let our preferences lead us from there. Thank you Orlando and thank you Davidson and Licht for a magnificent shopping experience!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>I've bought two watches from Davidson & Licht and will 100% be coming back in the future. The store is conveniently located, spacious, and spotless. The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and accommodating.

I mainly worked with Jake for my purchases and that experience was nothing but phenomenal.  The first watch purchased was a gift for my Dad so there were quite a few unknowns at the time.  Jake was able to help walk me through the decision process, find me the perfect watch, and extended the return/exchange window to make sure I felt as comfortable as possible with the purchase.

After that first experience, I was hooked. Jake stayed in touch via email, and kept an eye out for a particular watch. We checked in monthly, and he was able to find me my watch much earlier than expected. The pick up process felt VIP -- special presentation table, sizing, detailed explanation, everything! Jake and Kevin went the extra mile to make sure the experience was flawless.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrdF0YQxuJpvAqpBtw5rlBCSv7MRzTVEfb4XGA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1614731316263, 'text': "Thank you Ryan, we are so happy to hear that you had such a great experience working with Jake & Kevin to select your two new watches.

My husband and I came here looking to replace an engagement ring, I was looking for something similar, but of course better. We always try to buy from family owned businesses whenever possible, so when I was searching here on Google I looked for 3 things. Of course best reviews, being family owned, and also being around for more than 30 years, so we went to Davidson & Licht. We had the pleasure of Orlando assisting us, he was very helpful at helping design a ring to my desire, and it turned out more beautiful than I ever imagined. We also had a deadline that we hoped to have it done by, and he was able to make that happen for us, with a few days to spare too! I couldn't be happier! Thank you Orlando and thank you Davidson & Licht<//Text>

<text>Excellent service. Orlando was quite professional. He took the time to answer our questions, understanding that we do not live in close proximity to the store and it wasn't like we could just drop in at any time. On the phone, he exhibited patience with his courteous nature. In person, he displayed class, was polite to my family & pleasantly assisted us throughout the entire process without making us feel any pressure whatsoever. Highly recommend this business & that you go in and see for yourself!<//text><userid>117979788164681271251<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Fantastic experience from start to finish.

After a pleasant conversation on the phone with Jake a few days prior, my wife and I dropped into the store last Sunday to check out some watches. We were greeted at the front by Kirby who was extremely friendly. The store at the time was rather busy, but multiple individuals continued to check in with us while we waited.

We were eventually helped by Orlando, who was incredibly professional and patient. My wife had a rough idea of which watches she liked but wanted to see some on wrist. Orlando stood by offering information and support as she tried on several before landing on a particular Cartier model.

We couldn’t be happier with our first experience here. Definitely plan to be back!< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate><time>1620590882178< /time>< Name>

We had an amazing experience here! Kevin helped us with my Rolex watch with shortening and cleaning it and the process was quick and easy. He was very thorough and informative of the cleaning process and what to expect next! He also offered to clean my engagement ring which was so thoughtful of him. Overall, Kevin, Kirby and another sweet woman made our experience very welcoming. They are also very dog friendly, our pup loved all the attention and pets. We will definitely be back for future purchases, highly recommend!<//Review>

<review>I went to Davidson and Licht to get my watch tuned up and repaired. I was greeted by Alex and then introduced to Jake who oversees the repair department in Walnut Creek. Both men were very cordial and efficient. Jake made a couple of recommendations, gave me a quote and a timeline and I was on to my next appointment in a timely fashion.  I was very impressed.</review>< pics>

What can I say, Jeremiah is simply the BEST!!!
He help me find a nice gift for myself. Several of my friends have dealt with him in the past and he came highly recommended. He did not disappoint! He was able to find the exact watch that I wanted and his service and communication was top notch. I look forward to reaching out to him the next time I’m in the market for a timepiece. Well done Jeremiah, well done my friend.</text>

<text>Thank you Davidson & Licht and Jake!

First time purchasing Panerai from this store. Jake was so kindly helping me through out the process including email back and forth.

He even setting the watch aside for me until I came to make the purchase since it was the only one left in the store.

Couldn’t be happier than that!

Top notch & all stars customer service indeed.

Will be back when I’m ready for my next watch collection.

A few years back we had D&L custom design and build all our rings and we were blown away at the level of service from everyone at the Walnut Creek store.

Recently we went in to get our rings resized. The process was not only painless but the staff was so kind and helpful once again. The high level of service combined with the quality workmanship are just a few of the many reasons we won’t be going anywhere else as long as D&L is around.

Thank you all!< /review>< rate>

< Review>
I spoke to Orlando by phone regarding some jewelry that is part of an estate. He offered to give a general review and comments without us doing a formal appraisal. When my wife and arrived with several pieces he welcomed us and spent as much time as we needed even though he knew we were not there to look at a new purchase. He treated us and our “treasures” with great respect and even cleaned them along with my wife’s rings. We have purchased jewelry from Davidson and Licht in the past and no doubt will be back again.<//Review>

I’ve been going to Davidson and Licht for a few years now, and they’ve helped me buy three watches and some jewelry. Everyone there is very professional and friendly, and I’ve never felt pressured to purchase something I didn’t want. On top of that they have a lot of small touches throughout the purchase to make it unique and special. I’d also like to give a special shout-out to Jeremiah and Orlando for being a huge help with all my purchases!<//Review>

Amazing experience buying new earrings.  We arranged to meet Paul on a friday afternoon.  He spent over an hour with us looking through their collection to find the right pair and even offering options to possibly make custom changes.  They have a beautiful selection of fine jewelry and their staff have years of experience to suggest the right shape, cut and size to match your style, appearance and budget.  Especially like the idea of the wish list they will keep, so hubby can go by before holidays or birthdays to see what I have picked out!<//Text>

<text>My husband and I came here looking to replace an engagement ring, I was looking for something similar, but of course better. We always try to buy from family owned businesses whenever possible, so when I was searching here on Google I looked for 3 things. Of course best reviews, being family owned, and also being around for more than 30 years, so we went to Davidson & Licht. We had the pleasure of Orlando assisting us, he was very helpful at helping design a ring to my desire, and it turned out more beautiful than I ever imagined. We also had a deadline that we hoped to have it done by, and he was able to make that happen for us, with a few days to spare too! I couldn't be happier! Thank you Orlando and thank you Davidson & Licht</text>< Pictures>

Incredible, simply incredible. Purchased a Rolex from Ruslana last year and have been back several times since. Even if we’re in for a quick shine, Davidson & Licht treats us like royalty. This is the kind of jeweler that you want to build a lifetime relationship with - we pass dozens of jewelers on the way from San Francisco just to experience Davidson & Licht. They are really THAT great!<//Text>

I had the absolute pleasure of being assisted by Janell. She was patient and very knowledgeable. I had told her that my intent was to try some rings on and learn more about cut, clarity and color.

I bought Rolex watch from Davidson & Licht today. Both Orlando and Janel were exceptionally helpful. If you are looking for a high end watch or Jewelry, I highly recommend you come to this beautiful place in Walnut Creek, downtown.  When I explained to Janel what I wanted, she immediately brought in Orlando to the table  . They were both very easy to work this. They listed to me what I wanted as a customer and provided me few options. They were not trying to make a sale. Their goal was my satisfaction. I really appreciated that. Thank you Janel and Orlando. I am very happy 😀😀😀😀. I will remember this experience for the rest of my life.<//Text>

<text>When I first stopped into Davidson & Licht seven months ago to inquire about a grail watch, I was immediately impressed with their overall professionalism and especially their highly knowledgeable staff. I felt an immediate connection with Jake as we talked watches. I placed myself on their waitlist and Jake and I kept in touch via email after that initial visit.

A month ago I again visited Jake at D&L to ask about a specific watch for my sixtieth birthday. Jake said he could get it. Sure enough, last Friday Jake called to say he had the watch. I immediately drove over and purchased it. Jake was great at explaining everything about owning the watch and he even sized it perfectly the first time (no small feat). Not once did I feel pressured to buy. My entire experience with D&L and Jake has been nothing but positive. Thank you!< /text><Name>Kevin Durkin</Name>< userid>

The minute I walked in, I was immediately greeted and was given the necessary precautions to feel safe with covid. Jake went out of his way to help me find the perfect watch for my wife for Valentine’s Day. Davidson & Licht is the best place to purchase precious gifts for you and your family. My experience was tremendous to the point where I knew this was the place I would come back to when in need for the perfect gift. Jake went above and beyond to help me with any inquiries I had. I highly recommend Davidson & Licht to anyone who’s looking for the best customer service and valuable presents for yourself, friends, and family.< /review>

Hank is first class in every single way! First and foremost, Hank’s attention to detail is unrivaled and unparalleled. He made certain that my fiancé and I found the exact engagement ring and band to satisfy both of our wants and needs.

Hank is so kind, patient, and accommodating as well. He took as much time as we needed to ensure we found exactly what we were looking for from the moment we walked in the store. I cannot say enough good things about Hank and his character. He sincerely cares about his customers and is the epitome of the ideal person you would want to purchase your lifelong form of commitment from. Thank you again Hank, we will be back in the very near future!</Review>

< Review>
I have purchased two watches at D&L and in both instances the service was simply outstanding. Incredible staff, very helpful and knowledgeable. A special shout to Orlando, who served me both time - they don't come any better. He made the whole buying experience an absolute joy. The fact is you can buy most (if not all) of the brands that D&L carry for the same price at many stores, so how you are treated is the difference. And i have never been treated better as a customer than I have at Davidson & Licht.<//Review>

Had a decent experience. The representative that helped me was very knowledgeable and did not pressure me into buying anything. He gave me several options and answered every question I had. My only concern was he could have been more attentive when it came down to purchasing the ring. Updates on when the ring will be in and why it took a while to receive the ring after paying in full. I had to reach out personally to find out. Customer service could have been better, as far as offering water, etc especially when deciding to make a big purchase with a well established jeweler. Overall  they have great product and are knowledgeable. Customer service could improve.<//Text>

Davidson & Licht is a great place to shop for your jewelry and watches!  The space is beautiful and showroom is elegantly arranged. I especially want to thank Ruslana for her help with adjusting the bracelet on my watch and showing me some earrings for my wife. She asked really good questions to help narrow down my search, explained the differences between the pieces and ultimately helped me choose the perfect gift.  I cannot say enough about her professionalism, enthusiasm and her personal approach to helping her customers. If you want a no pressure and down to earth experience shopping, I highly recommend seeing Ruslana.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><review>I've been on the market for a new time piece for quite some time, and there are only so many authorized dealers  in the area. I specifically chose Davidson & Licht purely based on reading reviews, and I had no doubt in mind this was where I wanted to go.

From the moment I called and inquired, David was fantastic. He answered all my questions and provided me names of potentials representatives to ask for if I were ever to come in. I ended up going the very next day, today.

David recommend speaking with Jeremiah, and I noticed there were a lot of great things said about him based on other reviews. When I arrived, I was greeted right at the front door. Everyone wore mask and you get hand sanitizer right when you enter. I initially said no to water but was brought one anyway, thanks! I let the nice representative in the yellow dress know I was waiting for Jeremiah. Orlando came over, greeted me and started to help me. I didn't want to wait too long so why not. Once Jeremiah freed up from his previous client, he came over and stepped in. It was awesome to see the teamwork and camaraderie among peers.

My experience with Jeremiah was great. He is definitely a product expert, knew everything about the pieces I was asking about. He was also very patient and sincere as I was debating between a few different pieces. He was honest, never once made me feel like I had to purchase anything. I never felt he was pushy or just trying to make a sale. I guess that's the different when it comes to luxury retail. I ended up picking up the piece I came in for, and the whole experience was everything I expected and some. We ended up having a nice conversation, not even about watches. Jeremiah and Davidson & Licht is my go-to now moving forward for time pieces.

Jake also came and helped me size my piece, much appreciated. He went above and beyond to make sure it felt just right. The entire team here at Davidson & Licht really made me feel at home and great about my purchase. Everyone was beyond helpful and a pleasure to work with. They are as advertised, and I recommend coming here for all your time piece/jewelry needs. It's all about the experience, and that was exactly what I got.

Big shout out to Jeremiah, Jake and Orlando, and the nice lady in the yellow dress. You got a customer for life. I'll always stop by when I'm in the area.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1618877052229, 'text': 'Hevesy, Thank you so much for your wonderful review about our team at Davidson & Licht.

<Text>René and I had such a wonderful experience at Davidson & Licht. Orlando was tireless and professional in his efforts to support us as we searched for our wedding rings. As diamond novices, he was patient and taught us both all about diamonds so we could choose the perfect stone for my ring.

<Review>Ruslana has been welcoming every time my family goes to this Walnut Creek location.  She also is very engaging, often keeping me in mind when pieces come in. The occasional phone call or text, along with her welcoming demeanor make me want to come in and skip other local jewelers.

This is my favorite shop for watches and jewelry in the East Bay.  The service is impeccable!  Those in the shop know their business well and they always make excellent recommendations!  My go-to person is Orlando, as he is very knowledgeable and responsive, but any of the staff will be pretty terrific.  I highly recommend a visit should one seek jewelry.</text>

Davidson & Licht is one of the very few places in today’s world where you truly feel valued as a customer. I brought my Panerai watch in with a broken pin in the band and left 5 minutes later, no charge, having been offered water, coffee and generally treated like a king by the guys in the watch department. Thank You!

Shop there if you like being treated well....<//Review>

I went to their store looking to get a custom wedding ring after I heard great reviews from some friends. Everyone there was extremely professional and the all around service was fantastic. I got to work with Alex Licht mostly who was their custom jeweler and I couldn't be more happy with the service and the final product! He was able to create everything to my exact (and slightly ridiculous) wishes which I was do grateful for. Needless to say I will be going back to Alex and the rest of the team for all my future jewelry needs.< /Review>

<text>Ruslana has been welcoming every time my family goes to this Walnut Creek location.  She also is very engaging, often keeping me in mind when pieces come in. The occasional phone call or text, along with her welcoming demeanor make me want to come in and skip other local jewelers. And when she’s not around Jeremiah and the other sales staff share the same courtesy.</text>< Time>

<review>I recently purchased a Watch from this place from one of sales associates Ruslana. She is very knowledgeable about product and friendly. I  had quite a few question and she seemed to answer all of them quickly. I will shop here again. Keep it up!

<review>When my husband and I went to look for engagement rings 4 years ago he asked if I cared where he purchased a ring from. I told him somewhere that is reputable but most importantly a place that will treat us like family. You have your pick of reputable jewelers in the East Bay but none compare to the service, friendship, and experience you will get at Davidson and Licht! Any time we find ourselves walking around downtown Walnut Creek we will pop in to get our rings cleaned, typically a quick in and out activity at most jewelers, when we walk in we are greeted by name as if we are walking into our families homes for a visit. By the time we find ourselves leaving its been a 45 plus minute visit catching up with everyone. LIke I said the employees are like family and treat us like family. We have worked with Orlando since day one and over the years our relationship has gone from client, jewelry to a true friendship. If Orlando isn't available or isn't in everyone else we have worked with has gone above and beyond to make us feel at home. Davidson and Licht is everything we hoped for in a family jewelry< /review>< Pics>

< review>
I’ve been a resident of Downtown Walnut Creek for just over 2 years and now recently purchased a home here in the East Bay. I wanted to recognize two individuals at Davidson & Licht, 1 whom I’ve built a great relationship with and made a purchase of Tudor Watch for my fiancé back in October of 2020, and then 2nd individual whom I made several purchases with at Forevermark Jewlers also in Downtown Walnut Creek who is a recent addition now to the Davidson & Licht family. Jeremiah Aguiao who is the manager at this store went above and beyond to make sure that I was satisfied with my purchase, my fiancé had purchased 2 watches previously from here for her employees and I wanted to get her something nice for her birthday. I had originally ordered a Tudor Watch back in August of 2020 and was told it would take about 3 months to get in, unfortunately it kept getting pushed back and back but eventually I was able to secure a different Tudor Watch for my fiancé and Jeremiah was able to work with me on an even more expensive Tudor Watch in which my fiancé really liked! I’m looking forward to doing a lot of business with Jeremiah in the near future. The 2nd individual who’s new to Davidson & Licht is Hank Stenner, I’m so excited for Hank and his new role with Davidson & Licht, my fiancé and I had a previous existing relationship with Hank when he was at Forevermark in Downtown Walnut Creek, I purchased several pieces from him there over the last 2 years. Hank is a professional and takes a valued interest in what’s important to your needs and goes above and beyond to make things happen. I’m excited for what his future will look like with this store. We stopped in a few days ago to look at some pieces and Hank was awesome as always.</review>

Everyone at Davidson is professional and hospitable.  I have always received great service from Orlando, Jeremiah, and Ruslana.  I have to give a special shout out to Orlando and Jeremiah for a recent acquisition, and helping me find a very special piece.  I highly recommend using Davidson and Licht for all watch and jewelry needs.< /Text>

We had 2 watches that needed tune up /cleaning.  I got mine back on time but my
wife’s needed further work. We went to Hawaii and got held up there for 9 months. Davidson & Licht kept us posted about the watch. The staff  are very knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend this company and will not hesitate to be repeat customer.< /Review>

The people at D&L are pros, very friendly and attentive. I’ve purchase two watches from them.

The warranty on my watch was still in place however the watch was sent to Rolex in Texas and Rolex would not honor the warranty based on what they called impact damage. I didn’t damage the watch. It just stopped. What’s the use of a warranty then?<//Review>

Awesome Experience! I’ll give them 10 stars!!! The doorman was courteous. The staff were so attentive. As soon as we walked in,  we were offered something to drink such as water or coffee. Jeremiah (in-charge of the watch Dept) answered all our questions and helped us find the perfect Rolex watch for my husband’s birthday gift. Ruslana, the sales lady who finalized the sale, provided us with excellent customer service and offered us champagne. Both Jeremiah and Ruslana were very professional, knowledgeable, and very patient. We are so pleased. We will definitely buy from Davidson and Licht again.</review>

I, initially, contacted this AD via phone.  Ruslana gave me an insight of the current availability/allocation of certain Rolex models and the wait list process.  Her friendly demeanor, ability to listen and willingness to answer my inquiries that most of the AD’s lacked, without a doubt, made me choose them.  I’ve visited/phoned several of them in NorCal, but did not have the same reception.

My initial impression was more apparent when I visited her to check out their current inventory and express my interest on certain models.  Although I left the shop empty handed, she assured to keep me posted.  She did just that.

As promised, I was invited on two separate occasions as models on my list were available.  However, I had to pass as both of the timepieces didn’t sit right on my wrist.  They were too big on my wrist.  She completely understood and said, “I wouldn’t be offended if you don’t purchase it.  I want you to be happy and have the right watch that you really want.”

Today, it’s was third time the charm.  Unexpectedly, she called and I drove there.  I end up with “the watch.”  She was patient enough to provide a quick tutorial about the watch.

I give D&L five stars for the unmatched service.  Thank you for the hard work.< /text>

I stopped by today to pick up
my watch that I had repaired. Foolish me arrived 3 minutes after closing time. What most don’t know is jewelry stores can’t let people in after closing due to insurance / safety reasons. Kevin happened to be outside and after talking to me he was able to facilitate getting me my watch by going to the back alley. I’ve been without my favorite watch for months thanks to Covid and Kevin made sure I didn’t have to wait any longer. This is just another example of the littler things Davidson &. Licht do for their customers. Thank you!< /text>

<review>The folks at D&L really are extremely friendly and helpful.  I was looking for a hard to find Rolex watch and they suggested I add my name to their waiting list. I wasn’t optimistic but I went ahead and sent an email with my details. Jeremiah responded graciously to my request and encouraged me to check back in occasionally.  Each time I visit I’m greeted with friendly hellos and a very knowledgeable staff. And just a day after the last time I checked in Jeremiah followed up with a phone call. With their most recent Rolex shipment, the watch I was looking for had arrived!  This is a first class local jewelry store where service is everything.<//review>< Name>

I love coming to Davidson & Licht Store. Their customer service is great. You will always receive first-class treatment here. The entire staff is amazing.
Last week I received a call from Orlando that my new Tudor Black Bay GMT had arrived. This is a pretty difficult watch to obtain. I picked it up on Saturday and I absolutely love it. Thanks to Davidson & Licht and Orlando I'm enjoying my first Tudor. I appreciate it very much.
Thank you guys, you are the best!</Text>

<review>Great experience! Went in to look at wedding bands for myself. Kevin Yates assisted us and was so nice, knowledgeable and helpful. He suggest a ring I loved, helped with sizing and offered to call the designer directly to customize it. The next day followed up to tell me they could do exactly what I wanted and had the order all ready to go. My fiancé and I even enjoyed a glass of champagne while we were shopping. Thanks Yates!!<//review></record></dataset><record>

This is the ONLY place I would ever consider purchasing FINE jewelry. The quality and the service is exceptional. From the moment you enter the store, you know you are in a special retail establishment. Every case displaces tasteful and unique pieces, some created on-site. The customer or better, the Guest, feels safe and cared for by all members of the staff. I have been a customer - almost family - for over 45 years...and I will always return, thank you for taking care of my fine jewelry needs.<//Review>

Back in 1996 when I was 5, my mom and I went to Davidson and Licht to buy my dad a watch for his birthday.

After we’d spent a few hours in the store and she’d picked out the watch, the owner said he had a surprise for me. He presented me with this ring and said he wanted to give me my first diamond. 23 years later, here it is!

Thank you Davidson and Licht for such a thoughtful gesture that really went the extra mile! What amazing service, it meant so much to us back then, and I still wear the ring on my pinky now!</Text>

<text>We have shopped at Davidson and Licht for the past 10 years.  We have never been disappointed. The quality of the various pieces of jewelry offered, from a variety of artisans, is excellent.
We have had the absolute pleasure of working mostly with Ruslana, and sometimes Mary.
Through the years we have purchased many beautiful Mikimoto pearl pieces. Ruslana recently worked closely with our son to create a custom diamond engagement ring.
Whether we just stop by to look, or go inside with the intention of purchasing something, we are greeted with a genuine smile by everyone and we are never rushed.  We wouldn’t buy jewelry anywhere else.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>All of the folks here are so friendly, professional, welcoming and knowledgeable. In particular, I’ve had lovely chats with Mary, Kevin, Orlando, and, of course, Jeremiah. He manages the watch side of the house, as far as as I know, and he loves, loves watches and knows the brands inside and out. From Jeremiah, I purchased a signet ring, a Tudor Black Bay 58, and, most recently, an IWC Spitfire (new for 2019). Jeremiah has a great, intuitive sense for what sort of watch would integrate well with a client’s collection. Of course, you have to let him know what you’ve got already to better inform his already exquisite intuitive sense of what might work for you. I cannot recommend Jeremiah highly enough. Super nice gentleman, total professional and a down-to-earth guy. I know I’ll be buying more watches from him in the future. Thank you!<//Text>< Pictures>

It has been a few years since I've been into this store. When I entered today, they remembered me and took the time to catch up on things. I found what I wanted quickly and was able to pay and get gift wrapping quickly. Great place to do your fine jewelry purchased.</Text>

This store is great and they have a spectacular watch and jewelry selection. Orlando helped me and is awesome at making sure my needs were met. I bought all my watches here and they’re excellent at keeping them maintained. I bring them in yearly and never had any problems with them. They are very professional with servicing and are excellent at communicating when your watch is ready for pick up. I would deal with these guys again and again.</Review>

I came in today without an appointment to see Jeremiah.  Unfortunately, he was with another customer.  Jeremiah asked his colleague, Jake to assist us.  Jake took the time and show us the item that we eventually purchased.  He explained the functions of the item.  We felt very comfortable of the purchase.  This business has been around for a long time.  Customer service is outstanding.< /Text>

< Review>
I received "the call" today from Kevin regarding my interest in getting a Rolex watch after waiting a reasonable amount of time on a waitlist. I arrived at the Davidson & Licht store a couple of hours later to pick up my watch. I am a returning customer and was treated with 1st class service and education - not unlike the first time I bought a watch with them 2 years ago. Kevin explained so much about the watch and Rolex and even had my other watch cleaned while I was waiting. Every time I have visited this store, the presentation of the merchandise, the customer service from the front door greeter to the watch professionals are just the best. I will always buy my fine watches with these folks. After returning to work later in the afternoon, I called Kevin again to thank him. I am beyond thrilled with my experience! This is the store to go to...</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>From the moment you walk in or if you call,  the service is excellent. They are informative,  helpful, and communicate clearly. I had a simple service of taking out a few links. Even though the watch was purchased as a gift from another state, they did the modification quickly and honored the manufacturer service agreement. I thought it was unfair that they were not charging me anything I offered and insisted to pay for the service. They declined politely.  The watches and jewelry they display are all beautiful and with the highest quality in mind. Go in and admire their offerings and the staff also teach you so much about jewels and watches. I would recommend them highly if you need any jewelry services or purchases.-Dr. Janice Wang DDS<//review>< pics>

<Review>I have purchased a couple of items here. Jeremiah has been extremely helpful each and every time along with the other associates. I didn’t know what to expect the first time walking into the store as I was in gym clothes but they didn’t seem to mind and was friendly and answered all my questions. The whole staff is friendly and easy to talk to. Recommend coming here and you won’t be disappointed.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1570835061967, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your review.

<review>The more I work with Jeremiah, John and the D&L team the more they become a true partner in providing those special pieces for life’s special moments.  I just picked up a Rolex for my mom who is turning 75 and the thoughtfulness and attention to detail in making everything perfect was just great.  They go above and beyond.  Highly recommended!<//review>< Pictures>

I’ve had my eye on that clever and unique little tool watch- the North Flag- for quite some time.  Came into the store for the first time, and Kevin provided me with outstanding service, showing me all the features of the watch, explaining why it was so special, while also showing me and explaining the differences in other Tudor references.

I returned to the store about 2 weeks later, when I was ready to purchase.  This time Jeremiah assisted me.  He was simply amazing and treated me like I was a long time customer, even though it was only my second time in the store.  I was not rushed, pressured, nor looked down upon in any way.  While he was preparing the purchase, I wandered over to the Rolex display and returned to advise him of my admiration for the Air King, and without hesitation, he brought it over for me to try on.  Simply stunning watch!!

Treating me with respect not ‘going through the motions’ goes along with me, and Kevin and Jeremiah deserve 6 out of 5 stars!!<//Review>

We’ve been regular customers for years. It’s always a pleasure to do business with the knowledgeable staff at Davidson & Licht.

Over the years they’ve helped us with jewelry and watch repair, and special orders. I’ve purchased watches there, and they have an impressive selection of unique jewelry from creative and talented designers.<//review>

This is my go to store to buy high end watches and jewelry, I've known Jeremiah for roughly 16year +/-, he is top notch when it comes to customer service. (Make sure the owners give him a big fat bonus, 😁). Seriously though these guys are great and will treat you above and beyond, not just a "sale" to them, it's a lifelong relationship.  Thanks again!!!< /Review>

Jeremiah was extremely welcoming and helpful in showing & letting me try on all the watches I was interested in, even when I originally walked in with no intention of buying. I was able to ask all the questions I had engage in conversation about various watches and their brands without feeling rushed, since I was not there to buy. Eventually when I came back here to buy a watch, Jeremiah made the buying process as smooth and hassle free as possible. I would definitely come back here again for my next watch as well and would recommend others do the same.</Review>

I got my first Rolex watch for my birthday gift (from my partner) at D & L today. Jeremy was exceptionally informative, accommodating and simply wonderful. The experience was truly fun and exciting, not intimidating at all. If buying a watch is this enjoyable, then I’m in trouble because it’s going to be the start of an expensive collection (or investment). Time to start saving for the next watch!</Text>

<Text>I have traveled the world over and have been to their countries best jewelry stores. When I was younger, naturally naïve, for jewelry I went to Tiffany’s to by jewelry for my girlfriends. Yes they were giddy and happy. However, if you know anything about jewelry, the saying would be something like ‘everyone has that exact same jewelry’. (Plus Tiffany’s name on the item is 40% of the cost) It worked in high school, but what would really stand out is something unique that was special and leaves an impact. Davidson and Licht is the diamond in the rough! The elegance of white gloves door men, complementary offering while you browse. A rotating selection so you will keep coming back. Absolutely friendly staff lead with elegance by the ultimate maestro, Orlando, that will do anything to help you and even procure exactly what you desire. They will never ever push you to buy anything, they are honest, and care about you unlike almost every other jewelry store. Every time you visit they will be happy to clean your jewelry. Walk in with no intention and just look... I have found one of kind jewelry that spoke to me, that embodied my relationship with my partner so perfectly that when I presented it to her it was as if I had proposed. They can also offer you the best gem stones in the world. This place is not just for women, it is equally for men as well. My first purchase was ‘Hearts on Fire’ diamond studs. (A diamond cut 100x the precision over all others, of the four C’s in diamond rating the cut is most important) Personally I am a watch collector. A mechanical watch mechanism created centuries ago is still considered the highest reaches of mans mechanical achievements, period. They have a watchmaker and goldsmith on sight as well. It’s a one stop shop for all your jewelry wants and needs like maintenance. They have gone all out to get me a Rolex almost impossible to get, but they got it! They have guided me though it all. I am a pilot myself and they suggested the new B55 Breitling, it was meant to be and literally saved my life! Honestly each watch they sell is very special. These watches are meant to last a lifetime and an Heirloom for all generations. I want them all, the IWC Pilot, the Cartier, Tudor and many more. Of course Rolex is the best for a reason. They are the best engineered and always one step ahead of everyone else with unmatchable precision. Everyone there knows my name and greet me with smiles and we converse like you would with any friend you haven’t seen for a period of time. Originally they were in a small mall location... Now they are on Main Street and a beautiful two story building that has clean lines yet that classic elegance (and finally! Parking in the back) They will go out of their way to assist you. The second floor could be arraigned for a private moment where they can arrange Champaign, flowers in a pristine environment exuding with elegance for moments such aa an anniversary or proposal. Often walking out of Tiffany’s my wallet hurts, leaving Davidson and Licht’s lights my soul and leaves a lasting genuine smile on my face. I will never go anywhere else. The owner Jon is very personable, caring, supremely genuine and I respect him for his leadership and creating the adults ultimate ‘candy store.’ His son Alex is an amazing goldsmith. Support this FAMILY OWNED business and you will never be disappointed! It is truly a unique treasure that is rare in these modern times; every customer is a VIP! I implore you to take the time even to just visit; give it a shot and I promise you will understand. Satisfaction Guaranteed.</Text><userid>103846292521320277026< /userid><date>1591849908332< /date></record></dataset><record>

Jeremiah was very helpful and provided us with fantastic service. We went to purchase a watch and he took his time to explain the options, walked us through the features and we were very pleased with the purchase. I'd highly recommend him and the store for special purchases.< /text>

Orlando is an amazing Consultant.  He is very knowledgeable and fun to work with.  We looked at many diamonds and settings and he never tried to rush us or push us to pick a certain one.  When I found the setting I wanted, I asked about customizing it.  My fiancé was not sure what we were designing so Orlando took the time to “mock up” a sample so David could understand what we were talking about.  After we were done, he said he would check if my requests were possible and get back to us.  Within a couple days he let us know it could be customized the way I wanted.  I am very excited to see my custom ring finished in a few weeks.

My 16 year old daughter had her late aunt’s ring which she had been wearing on a chain because it was way too small.  The staff carefully examined it and said they could make it to the correct size.  She was very worried because it is her prized possession.  When she got it back and put it on she nearly cried!  It was beautifully done!

The entire staff was gracious each time we visited!  It is the kind of customer service that really stands out.<//Text>

We visited Davidson and Licht recently to inquire about a custom engagement band. We brought along a loose diamond purchased elsewhere to have it evaluated as well. We were not treated very nicely at a local competitor when they found out we would not be buying the diamond from them....they were actually rude. They ultimately showed us a diamond that was very poor quality-almost the poorest. This is why we decided to come here instead. I am so glad we did! We were greeted, and after giving some initial information we were offered water and champagne. What a different experience already. We met Orlando, who helped us patiently and informatively through the process of choosing a style and material to best suit the pear shaped diamond we brought in. Orlando also took the time to evaluate our stone and give his honest opinion-he was impressed and in no way annoyed that we already purchased a diamond. We were more than pleased with our entire experience here. I look forward to writing another great review once we have the completed ring!!</Text>

<Review>They were very nice and courteous. From the door valet greeting us with his smile and guiding us in the right direction to the respectful assistance we got from the representative. We went to get a Rolex watch and a put in a repair for a Citizen watch. The representative educated us on the different eras the watches were, the potential type of repairs and options we would have if they couldn't repair it. He even provided estimates on the values of the watch. The water and candy were a nice touch as well. The representatives were even attentive to my rambunctious toddler. The only reason why I give them 4 stars is because upon my return the 2nd time to pick up my repairs, the representative different from the first was very snappy and she wasn't as welcoming and helpful</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This is the only place anyone should ever purchase a watch from! They have amazing customer service, they remember you when you walk in, and the staff is always friendly. I have had the privilege of working with Orlando, and have purchased two watches and a winder from the store. The price is fair, Orlando bends over backwards to ensure you are satisfied with your purchase and they always return phone calls. When customer service is coming hard to find, Orlando and the staff at D&L have not forgotten what is important. Highly recommend, there is no one better!<//Review>

<review>The Team at D&L is always friendly, welcoming and eager to assist.  The overall experience is very pleasant. Employees like Jeremiah build long term client relationships. Through a wealth of knowledge and advocacy with Dealers, there isn’t much he and others cannot do for you. Our family has been doing business there for almost 20 years. In today’s world, that says something!<//review>< user>

<time>1566858748830< /time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>This was my first visit to Davidson & Licht Jewelers. I was assisted by Jeremiah regarding a vintage, 1940’s watch repair. Finding the correct parts for this very old but sentimental piece was a lengthy task. I was extremely impressed by Jeremiah’s follow up, letting me know the difficulties that the watchmaker was experiencing. Unfortunately, in the end, a complete repair was not able to be accomplished but the watch was returned running, lubed, and the crystal beautifully polished. I will once again cherish wearing my father’s watch in spite of it running a tad bit fast.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>We’ve been shopping at Davidson & Licht for many years and the quality of the service is always top notch. Ruslana is knowledgeable, helpful, and always remembers us and what we’ve bought previously. You can’t find an experience like this at the big chain jewelers. Highly recommend</review>< user_id>

Great customer experience. Wouldn’t go to any other jeweler in the East Bay. Bought my wife’s engagement ring and wedding band here and the advice and input on what was best for my budget was invaluable. Orlando, Kevin, and John took great care of us!<//text>

I just had a wonderful experience with Davidson & Litch. I was looking for a jewelry store which is authorized for Cartier Watch service. They are the only one store in Walnut Creek. The service and professions are the First Class! I couldn’t be happier with D& L!  Thank you!!</Text>

Always a pleasure doing business with Davidson & Licht.  The staff is professional, knowledgeable, and willing to take as much time as necessary to make a decision.  The jewelry selection is extensive and a huge variety of luxury watches.  The finest jewelry store in the entire Bay Area.

Another very pleasant visit to Davidson & Licht. They always have an appropriate  piece for that special occasion.< /review>

I have shopped at Davidson and Licht for many years now. Their selection is beautiful and their personal service is excellent. Absolutely no reason to go to San Francisco to buy jewelry.  Just the right place for last minute Valentine’s Day shopping.< /text>

Wonderful jeweler where I purchased my first luxury watch 5 years ago and have been impressed with their service ever since. You do truly feel like royalty when you walk in , from the doorman who greats you, the offer of bottled water and candy orange wedges (on a silver platter!), to the personalized attention with sales associates remembering you by name! I highly recommend D&L!< /Review>

Specifically, I dealt with Kyle O.  He was a professional and gentleman.  Took the time to educate me, and my entire family.  Thank you! Looking forward to future purchases!</Review>< pics>

<Date>1551558804728</Date><text>Orlando is absolutely amazing. After failing to find the quality of services both myself and my soon-to-be fiancé were looking for at both Shane and Tiffany’s, we were relieved to find someone as knowledgeable and friendly as Orlando Rosario at your Walnut Creek location.

Not only did he help me find the perfect engagement ring, his level of professionalism and sincerity has assured me that I have found someone with the level of expertise I have been looking for.

I would recommend Davidson and Licht to my family, friends, colleagues, and  acquaintances.

Thank you Orlando and everyone at Davidson and Licht. I am happy for all your assistance as we journey on towards our marriage.

Orlando was absolutely amazing. First and foremost, super knowledgeable and personable. Took care in getting to know us and was a great example of true customer service. Offered beverages immediately upon entering the store. All other employees acknowledged us and said hello. We felt extremely welcome and taken care of. No pressure on where and what to look at. Listened to our needs and offered help appropriately. Orlando made the experience of engagement ring shopping so much fun, especially since it was our first time! It felt like he genuinely loves his career and we were excited to know about the family history of D&L. There seems to be so many perks in being their customer and we can't wait to come back as I know we will be well taken care of. Thank you again Orlando for making our experience unforgettable. We loved getting to celebrate with our favorite drinks as well :) Such a treat!</Text>

I’ve bought a few things over the years and have always found the staff to be knowledgeable and helpful. And they really do offer customers water and fruit everytime they come in!  Their watch experts know their stuff too and I particularly like working with Kyle - he’s offered me great advice and always has a moment to say hello when I come by.</text>

Very unpretentious - I had started at Tiffany’s just down the street but they refused to clean any jewelry not purchased at their store -  ‘a liability’ they said. Well, tens of thousands of $$ later, I hope they rethought their liability insurance. Too late for me. I love my new store!</Review>< pics>

<text>When I was ready to buy a watch, I did my research and went to check out an Omega and five Rolex authorized dealers. After spending time with the people at each store, my wife and I made the easy decision to come back to Jeremiah Aguiao at Davidson & Licht.

Jeremiah is very knowledgeable about the Rolex line and gave us all the information we needed without any pressure.  He always treated us as if we were the most important customer he had. His expertise and professionalism made it easy for us to order my new time piece from him. When it arrived (earlier than he promised) he excitedly called us to say it was in the store. We also had my wife’s Rolex and my old Omega serviced there.

We highly recommend you pay a visit to Jeremiah and his team at Davidson & Licht when you are in the market for a luxury time piece.</text>< GmapID>

Davidson & Licht is an amazing place to get the special forever piece of jewelry.   Mary has been a great partner when working through the special details of a particular piece of jewelry.   She takes the time to get to know you so the your final piece is perfect for you.    This is the only jeweler I use for not only new pieces but also revising old jewelry into new pieces which carry more meaning.</Text>

<text>I had a very nice watch that also has a lot of sentimental value that wasn't working. I was nervous searching for the right place to have it serviced. Davidson and Licht has the finest timepieces in the world in their showroom so I knew right away they would take care of my watch. The service was 5 star at every moment.

I never felt pressured to buy, and the staff were knowledgable and were happy to let me try on whatever my heart desires even if I knew I would not be buying the higher end pieces.

<gmapID>0x808561c3cc99e1b1:0x6a8a963fec593186<//gmapID><Text>Bought several Rolex watches from here and just recently picked up another hot watch on the market, the green Submariner aka the Hulk.

I thought I might have to wait another 3 months to get this watch but this morning I received unexpected phone call from Jeremiah and said the watch I have been waiting for is available for me to pick up.

Thank you, Jeremiah for fulfilling my wishlist a lot sooner than expected. I am extremely happy with the new purchase and the service you provided.<//Text>< name>

I had a wonderful experience purchasing a watch at Davidson & Licht and can’t recommend them enough. The staff clearly has a high level of expertise and are super friendly! Specifically, Jeremiah was extremely pleasant to work with, is very passionate and knowledgable and I’ll definitely be going back to him for future purchases.< /text>

< Review>
It's really annoying You take the time to research and find the rolex you want. You find a place that  Is supposed to have a 5 star rating.You go there because they have one in stock to purchase it and the only person that seems to be intrested in you is the security guard. Me  and my wife stood at the rolex counter for 20 minutes. The salesman must be pay by the hour because if they were on commission that's one sale I wouldn't want to miss. Customer service is everything. Won't be back</Review>

Their staff is comprised of consummate professionals and has exceeded all expectations particularly surrounding service on my previous purchase, and expertise with new and pre-owned luxury brand watches. I’ve also been fortunate to have worked with the same individual throughout the past 15 years. I highly recommend this fine establishment.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

You must stop by if you're shopping for any kind of jewelry or watch. Their prices are comparable to anywhere else and, most importantly, their quality and service is far better than what you will find anywhere else. I went Davidson & Licht while looking around for an engagement ring and had the best experience you could ask for. Orlando was an amazing help and never once felt like I was being sold or talked into anything, unlike almost every other shop I went into while looking for the perfect ring. It felt more like I as being helped by a friend that only wanted to help me get exactly what I was looking for. During one of my visits I was even helped by the one of the owners, Jon Licht, and he was extremely nice and so happy to help with all the questions. Everything from start to finish was as easy and relaxed as possible and my fiancé has the most beautiful engagement ring and we both couldn't be happier.</Text>

Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of visiting the Davidson and Licht Jewelry store on Main Street in Walnut Creek.  I'm sure I'm not the first to be captivated by the beauty of the store which has a great variety of upscale, brand name Men's Watches.  I was also so impressed by courteous and knowledgeable sales consultants.  They were extremely helpful and just really nice to work with during my visits.  I recommend this store for it's incredible beauty, terrific selection of watches and jewelry, and for unsurpassed customer service.  I can't wait to go back!< /text>

<text>Davidson & Licht is the best Jewelry store in Walnut Creek when it comes to fine jewelry, watches and customer service.  Jeremiah and Mary always greet us with a smile and they both go above and beyond to accommodate our jewelry needs.  Jeremiah has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to Rolex Watches.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I have been visiting Davidson & Licht for several years now and I absolutely LOVE the people there. I am always greeted with a smile and the feeling is so warm and inviting from everyone who works there, it's like a big family. Although the store on Broadway Plaza was very nice, I have to admit I think the new store on Main St. is absolutely gorgeous! I was blown away the first time I walked in to see the huge selection and beautiful architecture of the store. It's truly an experience to browse and try on all the exquisite jewelry, you can just get lost in there. If you are looking to escape for a little while and feel and be treated like a princess, shop at Davidson & Licht, you will never go anywhere else!< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Ruslana was fabulous! She listened to me and gave great suggestions. I wasn't planning to buy today, but Davidson & Licht has a generous return and exchange policy. AND as a member of the LGBTQ community, I didn't feel judged AT ALL (and they are in the heart of Walnut Creek!) D&L are officially my go-to jeweler.< /review>< pics>

Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of visiting the Davidson and Licht Jewelry store on Main Street in Walnut Creek.  I'm sure I'm not the first to be captivated by the beauty of the store which has a great variety of upscale, brand name Men's Watches.  I was also so impressed by courteous and knowledgeable sales consultants.  They were extremely helpful and just really nice to work with during my visits.  I recommend this store for it's incredible beauty, terrific selection of watches and jewelry, and for unsurpassed customer service.  I can't wait to go back!< /text>

You won’t be disappointed! Go see Orlando or any of the friendly and patient staff for that matter.  Whether it was beautiful women’s jewelry or difficult to find watches they have helped me purchase gifts for myself and my family that will undoubtedly be handed down for many generations.</text>

I gotta give a shoutout to Ruslana! Just absolutely amazing service. Story: I was in a time crunch for an engagement ring and had to have it in 30 days. And from start to finish she absolutely took care of me. From helping me picking out the diamond to the band and then going out of her way to make sure I received it in time for my proposal (and being in constant contact with me with updates)...she is literally, absolutely, unequivocally the BEST!!! Oh and the quality of the final product...unmatched. Wife loves it so much!<//Text>

I have been a loyal customer of the Walnut Creek store since the mid-90s, perhaps earlier, and have missed shopping there since having moved out of state.  When my wife and I visited the new store on a recent visit, we discussed the possibility of upgrading her wedding ring with Jon Licht.  We ultimately decided on a wonderful band and beautiful center diamond from his extensive inventory.  However, the ring needed some customization.  We left it in Jon's capable hands and a month later, received an exquisite and beautiful ring, which exceeded our expectations.  Over the years, we have found the employees to be very friendly, knowledgeable, and the brands carried upscale and reasonably priced for the quality.  I highly recommend this jewelry store and visit it every time we're back in the area.< /Review>

I have known Jon and shopped at Davidson and Licht for over 24 years. In that time both he and his staff have been exceptional in terms of service but also as far as the jewelry lines that they carry. He helped my wife and i custom design various pieces as well as show us designers that he knew that she would like. I have rarely met anyone in the retail business who is as attentive to his customers as Jon is.
There is nowhere else that I would go for purchasing jewelry then his store.<//text>

My wife & I have been customers for several years now. Our experience with the owner and his sales staff have always been pleasant & friendly. I firmly believe in getting what you pay for. This store gives it's customers their full attention. Whether it's watches or jewelry, they know their products!!! Most customers who go to high end stores like this already have an idea of what they are looking for. The professional sales people here only help the customer make an informed decision of what they want to purchase. Never felt pushy or condescending (as some reviewers had written).  First experience with them was a simple watch battery change, now we are customers for life.</Text>

Jeremiah was a great salesperson and a true pro. He knows his watches, movements as well as dial finishing. I would heartily recommend him for any watch purchase (and a signet ring purchase, too)l Once Baselworld is over and I see what new Rolex watches come out, I'll be back. Thanks, Jeremiah!< /review>

5 stars is an understatement when reviewing Davidson & Licht. Not only do they sell only the highest quality diamonds, but their customer services is unmatched. It is almost as if when you buy a piece of jewelry from them you become a part of their family. I have never experienced customer service to this level. When walking through the door I am greeted and welcomed by every person in the store. The jewelry I bought will last for generations to come, and will never think of going to another jeweler. They stand by their jewelry, and when walking through Walnut Creek, they are always happy to clean and service my jewelry at no charge, making it look exactly like the first day I purchased it. I am a customer for life, and look forward to many more purchases in the future. 100 stars.<//Review>

This gem in downtown Walnut Creek is a must-visit for anyone looking to add a piece of exquisite beauty and quality to their collection.  The staff is exceptional, both from a customer service standpoint and knowledge of product.  From the moment you walk in, you sense the pride and professionalism of the staff and the warm and welcoming atmosphere.  From fine watches, to engagement rings, to gorgeous diamonds, Davidson & Licht has it all and takes great care in your experience and satisfaction as a customer.  Highly recommend!</Review>

<review>I have known Jon and shopped at Davidson and Licht for over 24 years. In that time both he and his staff have been exceptional in terms of service but also as far as the jewelry lines that they carry. He helped my wife and i custom design various pieces as well as show us designers that he knew that she would like. I have rarely met anyone in the retail business who is as attentive to his customers as Jon is.
There is nowhere else that I would go for purchasing jewelry then his store.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Jason and John are the best in their trade! They are confident in their selection for their customers and gentle with their approach.  I never feel pressured or like they are trying to up-sell me. I am very specific when it comes to my taste in jewelry.  I love classic and timeless and D&L displays my exact taste, while carrying contemporary pieces that are very unique and not commonly worn by every other woman in these parts.  I have an appreciation and respect for small businesses and will continue to patronize D&L for their customer service, knowledge and family ownership.< /text>

<text>My wife & I have been customers for several years now. Our experience with the owner and his sales staff have always been pleasant & friendly. I firmly believe in getting what you pay for. This store gives it's customers their full attention. Whether it's watches or jewelry, they know their products!!! Most customers who go to high end stores like this already have an idea of what they are looking for. The professional sales people here only help the customer make an informed decision of what they want to purchase. Never felt pushy or condescending (as some reviewers had written).  First experience with them was a simple watch battery change, now we are customers for life.< /text>< Time>

< Review>
I have been a loyal customer of the Walnut Creek store since the mid-90s, perhaps earlier, and have missed shopping there since having moved out of state.  When my wife and I visited the new store on a recent visit, we discussed the possibility of upgrading her wedding ring with Jon Licht.  We ultimately decided on a wonderful band and beautiful center diamond from his extensive inventory.  However, the ring needed some customization.  We left it in Jon's capable hands and a month later, received an exquisite and beautiful ring, which exceeded our expectations.  Over the years, we have found the employees to be very friendly, knowledgeable, and the brands carried upscale and reasonably priced for the quality.  I highly recommend this jewelry store and visit it every time we're back in the area.<//Review>

<review>I just visited the new store in Walnut Creek. What a fabulous place. I have always found the staff to be very professional and helpful and they did not disappoint once again. Davidson and Licht has all the best brands of watches and fine jewelry. I did also see some of the most creative collections I have ever seen including a new brand of Diamond Mosaics called Pleve'. Each piece is unique and made by an artist so that was really a fresh new concept!< /review>< rating>

<review>My husband and I love D&L.  We are treated like family every time we walk through the door, from the doorman to the owner himself, John.  We have purchased several pieces and all have been of the highest quality.  August has helped us with each purchase and we are always amazed with his depth of knowledge and pleased with his level of professionalism.  He continuously goes out of his way to accommodate us from providing historical appraisals to making sure that we have that exceptional piece for anniversaries or special occasions.<//review></record>

I used to feel intimidated by the fancy facade/decor of this place, but that disappeared the moment I went in for a second opinion for the repair of my engagement ring. The entire staff have such warm, friendly and genuine personalities, so I felt instantly at ease the moment I walked in. The doormen always remember you and are equally as kind and welcoming. I'm so happy that I went in because they fixed my ring for a fraction of the price as a nearby competitor, and offer to clean my other jewelry while I wait every time I'm in. The free parking in back is a true bonus. I really like how I didn't feel rushed or passed over simply because I went in for a small repair and wasn't spending much at all. This kind of true customer service not only wins my trust, but it also warns my respect. Very well done, D&L!< /text>

This is my second purchase here. Jon Licht knew exactly what I was looking for the moment we met. We found a superb engagement ring.  Never was pushy or rushing me into buying. There is a reason why you come here, it's the QUALITY, the VALUE, the SERVICE, the GUARANTEE you pay for. Highly recommend Jon light and his team, you won't regret there expertise and professionalism!<//review>

Beautiful store.   We also went there for the Walnut Creek Halloween Trick or Treating--they appear to be pillars of the community.  The doorman was SO sweet to my kids--TRUST ME!  that means a lot!   I think it says a lot about a store and when they care about the city and the people in it.     Bonus: they also have a goldsmith, watchmaker, and gemologist on site!   That can be handy!<//review>

< Review>
I work in downtown Walnut Creek and finally decided to check out the new D&L store after passing by many times. Even though I was just in jeans and a t-shirt, the doorman was super friendly and I was quickly greeted by a nice salesperson. I told them I just wanted to browse, and they offered me some water and candy while I looked around. Overall, great experience, beautiful store and friendly salespeople. I'll probably drop in again for my girlfriends' birthday.<//Review>

When my husband and I were dating (maybe 13 years ago) he purchased a small, but very beautiful necklace with pink diamonds to give to me on Christmas morning.  Although my taste for jewelry has become somewhat more sophisticated over the years, my love for Davidson & Licht has never wavered.  The exceptional quality of their jewelry and their incredible customer service is what keeps us coming back year after year.<//Review>

From the moment you walk through the door you are treated the way locally owned businesses used to treat their customers.  You are greeted with a genuine smile, offered water and candy (I know….I was shocked too!) as they learn about what you are looking for and how they can help (Thank you for not pressure selling me!).  The employees have all worked there for a long time which speaks to not only their knowledge of fine jewelry but also to the fact it must be a great place to work.  I am also impressed that the owner is always working at the store.  To me that speaks to his drive for a quality experience buying a quality piece of jewelry (wow…that sounded like I work for them, but honestly I can’t explain it better).  Davidson & Licht not only has the best selection of Rolex watches in the Bay area, they have the best shopping experience (finally a store that gets it).  This store reminds me why it is so important to support local businesses that still care about the customer and not a bottom-line.</text><resp>None< /resp>< Name>

I have been a customer at Davidson & Licht since 2007. The customer service is impeccable. The selection of jewelry and watches are so good. I have personally bought several watches as well as many of my friends there. The new location is awesome and stunning. This is what a jewelry store should be and look like. Kudos to the staff especially Jeremiah. He really knows the products.< /text>

In one word: fantastic! I have been to quite a few jewelers in my 57 years, and Davidson & Licht, by a long shot, have the right mix of professionalism, friendliness, and honesty. I have taken my beloved Rolex watch, which I have worn every day for 30 years, numerous times to have links taken out & put back in, water damage repaired (my fault!), and a broken crystal replaced (again, my fault!). I have received service above and beyond one's imagination. In fact, we were so happy with Davidson & Licht and my watch, that my husband bought the male version of the same watch, and he, too, is very satisfied with his purchase. I'll end my review with one final word: integrity.<//Text>

I love all my shopping experiences at Davidson & Licht.  They are very personable, knowledgeable and most of all honest!  One of the things I love about them is that they don't try and sell you, they listen to you and really find the perfect item for you.  Their inventory is extensive from the classic styles to high fashion pieces.  And what can I say about their diamonds  WOW!!!!!  DAVIDSON & LICHT  is the perfect Jewelry Store, I highly recommend them.< /Text>

Came in with my fiancé not really knowing what to expect. Wanted to just look around and was actually planning on purchasing elsewhere. Was very impressed with the salesperson's knowledge and patience while we looked around. While the price was slightly higher than some of the online vendors we were looking at, we decided to buy both our diamond and setting from here.  We knew we could go back to them with any issues and just had a great experience working with them, would absolutely recommend to anyone looking.<//Text>

I have always had a great experience shopping at Davidson & Licht and working with their sales staff. They are so welcoming and knowledgeable about the jewelry and I feel confident about every single purchase because I know if I ever have a problem they will take care of me. They really do have outstanding customer service.

But! I recently popped in to see the new location and I am now INCREDIBLY impressed. The space is luxurious and their new designer jewelry is beautiful! I had such a great time walking around & trying things on & I fell in love with the Pleve collection! I couldn't believe how unique and interesting this mosaic jewelry is - definitely not something you see in other jewelry stores around here & that's why Davidson & Licht is so special.</Review>

How special it was to be greeted by their courteous doorman before entering the store, and then  treated to refreshments before starting my shopping experience. The service and expertise is only surpassed by how comfortable the salespeople made me feel while trying to decide what I could and could not buy that day ( at least 20 pieces pop into my head as I write this review).</Text>< Pics>

<Text>My fiance and I came in looking for ideas for both of our wedding bands. We ended up designing a totally custom band for her, and found a band from a very cool designer for me that I loved. The staff is very friendly and the service is great. We got to meet a lot of the family members, and worked closely with the owner's son, Jason. Especially becasue we designed a custom band for my fiance, there was some initial anxiety on how things would turn out, but the entire process was very smooth and a lot of fun, and we love the result!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_name>

Not only did they have a broad and nice collection of his work, they also had Panerai and Rolex watches for me to take a peek at as well!  From start to finish my experience at the store was top notch.  The team was professional and knowledgeable on the numerous questions I had about the jewelry and watches.

<Text>I love going here.  The new location is amazing. Stop by just to see the new location and how it is set up!  Inside they have a great selection of jewelry. The owner is usually around the store and very friendly. He seems to be in this business quite awhile and is very very knowledgeable. I always go back to his store first when considering a jewelry purchase. What really makes the place special is his attention to your needs.  If you need a gift for an anniversary, birthday, holiday, or just for fun they can find the perfect item to make that special someone happy.
Finally their James Bond watches and the Breitling Commercial for watches are awesome. Gorgeous P51 and  F4F.</Text>< response>

Ruslana is AWESOME! Went to her for our engagement ring. We had been to a few other places and found that many shops had diverse options, and looking back at it now that my fiancée and I are engaged a huge reason we came back to D&L was due to the service provided my Ruslana. She took her time knowing how important of a decision this was. She went above and beyond and also eliminated so much for the stress factor with me considering my fiancée left me with 3 on her “wish list.” Ruslana was there to confirm that the one I thought she liked the most was correct. She is now like our/my own personal jeweler, I go to her for holiday gifts and will be going back for our wedding band.we even decided to invite her to our wedding when the time comes.  Great place and Ruslana is an amazing resource for anyone looking at engagement rings as a couple or in secret. Highly recommend  reaching out to her for advice anytime me or my fiancée aren’t working with her!<//text>

They also have an on-site goldsmith and watchmaker- and even gave my bf a tour of their service rooms upstairs.

<Text>I was having dinner with some friends in the area and happened to stop by Davidson & Licht to check it out… this store is beautiful! The doorman greeted us and we were offered some water and candy while we browsed their jewelry collections (I definitely found a few items for the wish list). I’m sure I’ll be stopping by again soon - they even have a goldsmith and watchmaker upstairs.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>On our 5th Wedding Anniversary I decided to surprise my wife with something exquisite. I got her a pair of Mikimoto pearls since she is a beach lover and since she loved to wear her little black dress.

I spoke with Mary of Davidson and Licht and she helped me decide what to get for my sweetheart particularly the size. I described to her my wife's preferences and took Mary's advice for that perfect luxurious pearls.

My wife was so happy the moment she received her anniversary present and she totally loved it. She wears it all the time at work, special events and it made her look more feminine.

Thank You Davidson and Licht for the great customer service and for catering my need. Quality Service,quality product for a special life event.

I guess it's true "Happy Wife, Happy Life"

I went into Davidson Licht's only to have my too tight wedding ring removed. The staff greeted me at the door with champagne, guided me to a comfortable chair, and relieved my sore finger of it's too-tight band. You would have thought that I had announced the intent to spend lots of money on jewels! Thanks so much to everyone for their attention and kindness.<//Text>

My husband treated me with a necklace and engagement ring from Davidson & Licht, and my experience with them has been consistently excellent for over 10 years. As the years pass and my jewelry is still so enchantingly beautiful, the quality of the pieces becomes more apparent. Recently, I needed a repair and re-sizing for my engagement ring, and I returned to the store to pick up my ring today. The doorman remembered me and warmly welcomed me back, and I was immediately approached with a courteous, calm and professional spirit… precisely the experience I've had with every single visit to Davidson & Licht. I was regaled (as I've always been) by the pristinely captivating, yet embracingly comfortable ambience. My ring was impeccably repaired. The employees were sophisticated, attentive and thorough. I am so pleased with the outcome of repairing my sweet engagement ring… a piece of jewelry that is so precious to me!!< /review>

<response>{'time': 1475959003546, 'text': 'Hi Juanita, thank you the review and more importantly, for being a loyal customer for the past three decades. We have definitely grown over the years but try to maintain the top-notch service that our Bay Area customers have come to expect.  From watch services, to ring cleanings, and all of your jewelry purchase needs, we look forward to serving you for decades to come. As always, please stop by any time for a free cleaning of your diamonds and jewelry!'}</response><Text>I have had the pleasure of dealing with Davidson & Licht for over 30 years.  From their small store in Broadway Plaza to the beautiful showrooms that they have built on Main St., their attention to their customers has never changed.  If you go in more than twice they remember who you are and what you last purchased.  The sales personnel are knowledgeable, friendly and tactful.  The owner is a really down to earth gentleman that is always interested in stopping for a brief chat if he is in the store.

In the last thirty years I have gone in for everything from getting a new battery for a watch, having a mangle ring fixed to buying diamonds and pearls. There is no job too small or too large for their on site jeweler to tackle.

When you go in be prepared to remove all your jewelry for cleaning (free of charge of course) and they always offer you refreshments as soon as you walk in.<//Text><user_id>103758694518117421513<//user_id>< Pics>

I have been to the old store in the Broadway Plaza and was completely blown away by their new location! This is a grand building; from the staircase, skylight and even vines growing up the sides of the entrance, it was very impressive. A few of my friends are watch collectors so I decided to check out their Panerai and Breitling selections. They definitely have a large collection and their watch guy really knew his stuff. They even have their own in-house watchmaker. I’ll definitely be coming back when I’m ready to pull the trigger.< /Review>

<Text>Davidson & Licht are most certainly a 5 star jewelry and fine watch store. They have an amazing collection of luxury time pieces and they are the exclusive dealers in the in the East Bay area for Bremont watches. The high-end exclusive watches on show speaks volumes about the store, and to compliment this the staff are very friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgable about their products and their industry. Every time I visit I have a wonderful time and I am very well looked after. It's always a pleasure to spend time with the Davidson & Licht team.<//Text>< resp>

<text>I bounce from the east to the west coast quite often, and have my 'favorite' stores on both ends.   The newest addition to my west coast loves is Davidson & Licht.  The design of the Walnut Creek store is absolutely breathtaking.  I was greeted warmly and  throughout my visit the staff was incredible.  I was also introduced to a new brand, Italian designer Roberto Demeglio.

The designs are cutting edge and BONUS every piece is stretchable along with double BONUS a lifetime warranty!  The rings I can wear on any finger and the bracelets slide on easily so no help is needed.  Beautifully crafted with ceramic, gold and diamonds, these are my new go to accessories for all seasons and on both coasts.

THANK YOU EVERYONE @ DAVIDSON & LICHT!  <3</text><Name>Kristen Scher<//Name><time>1428012146286< /time><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><Rate>5< /Rate>< gmapID>

< Review>
I was strolling down the street of Walnut Creek to window shop for jewelry and finally decided to stop by in Davidson&Licht. At first  was very hesitant because their new place looks so grand and fancy and I was just wearing my basic Summer shorts flip Flops and tank top.Anyway,When I step in the entrance,Charlie the door man greeted mě and mind you he has a very pleasing personality.While browsing, a very warm, professional good looking gentle man asked on how can he help me. It was Mr. Jon Licht the owner of Davidson&Licht he helped mě decide on what diamond cut,size,my birth stone and etc. should I have in my tiny little finger. He is very well knowledgeable and even I haven't purchase anything yet He offered mě to clean my jewelries.I feel very privilege meeting him and the Rest of the staff. If you want class and quality,i highly recommend D&L.  They are superb,sophisticated,high end and many more. I couldn't wait for my next visit and have my diamonds,and speaking of diamonds,the clarity of theirs are flawless. They also carry mikimoto, rolex,hearts on fire and a lot more. You will really feel ať home and will be taken care of. Moře Power D&L< /Review>

Nice store but wow , the staff is so rude!! They seem to really judge you when you walk in the door! Someone should let these people know that those with real wealth don't feel the need to flaunt it ! They should maybe a little kinder to the busy moms and dads from lamorinda!< /review>

< Review>
Stopped by thinking my diamond was chipped and was prepared for bad news! John immediately reminded me I have insurance but during closer inspection discovered the "blemish" was actually glue of some sort! Thanks John for taking great care of me!</Review>

My fiancé proposed to me about a month ago with the most stunning ring, from Davidson & Licht. When he proposed, the diamond was set in a beautiful white gold presentation band. We went to Davidson & Licht to change out the band to platinum as well as look at wedding bands. During my experience, I worked closely with Vince. Vince was able to show me several different bands. I am very indecisive and was taking forever to make up my mind, but Vince assured me that I could take as much time as I wanted. I never felt rushed and was able to really think about what I wanted while talking through it with Vince. When he noticed that none of the bands I saw were “the one,” he offered to replicate my presentation band in a platinum version. I was elated and did just that.

I returned a week later to have the band switched out when it arrived. This time I was helped by Mr. Licht, his son Jason and Vince. While having my ring set, I was given espresso and water while they walked me around to different areas of the store to look at band options. They thoroughly educated me on the different metals for men’s wedding bands and how they differ both good and bad. They were able to guide me in the right direction and arrive at a decision. Once that was done, they began walking me through my band and went through my Pinterest with me to get ideas of what I was looking for. And once again, they thoroughly explained the pros and cons of the band style that I had selected and offered similar variations that would be more resilient in the years to come. When I was finally able to arrive at a decision, they were able to write up a quote for the order. As if that wasn’t enough, I then had Vince show me necklace options for my wedding. When I briefly explained an idea of what I was looking for, he immediately pointed a necklace out to me that was absolutely perfect.

The experience I had both times was outstanding. I could take as long as I wanted and could ask as many questions as I had. They were informative, incredibly friendly, and most importantly professional. I look forward to my quarterly visits for ring cleaning as it’s always a pleasure to visit. I highly recommend Davidson & Licht for anyone looking for quality paired with a great jeweler relationship. I wish I could give them 6 stars...</review>

It is rare to find a high end jeweler that makes you feel at ease along with having impeccable  customer service. This jeweler has the best selection of diamond jewelry, designer jewelry and watches. I purchased several watches from Davidson and Licht and have been impressed with the top notch customer service they provide from start to finish. But it doesn't stop there - they ensure your investment is taken care of for years after purchasing your watch. That's why I keep coming back. The staff is extremely knowledgable and are experts in providing the best advice for whatever you're looking for. Be it designer diamonds, a Rolex, Brietling or a newer up and coming watch line such as Bremont. They will help you find the best one for you and I promise you'll be back. Jeremiah is stellar and a true expert at helping you choose the best watch for you. I love the watches he helped me pick out. I highly recommend Davidson and Licht to anyone in market for fine jewelry and watches.</Review>

I heard of Davidson & Licht from a friend of mine. I wanted to get my parents original wedding rings resized, so they can have them for their 50th anniversary. It was short notice so I took them in, the staff was more than helpful and they were knowledgeable. It only took a couple of days to get resized they reset the loose diamonds and cleaned everything for me. The rings came out perfect the first time and my parents couldn't have been happier.</text>

<Text>Your experience begins with a nice greeting from the door man who will offer to put change in the meter for you. It is always nice to have free parking (back of the store - you just have to ring the bell) Immediately I was greeted by Vince and he became my personal shopping helper. I came in for earrings, specifically the harts on fire collection. The stones are cut so perfectly the light that's comes back out of the diamond shines like no other. You can look through the scope and see how perfectly symmetrical the diamonds are. They are the best cut diamonds in the world, and "Cut" is the most important of the four C's. I was drawn to the 1ct. pair and tried them on. I was sold.
The next day I came back and Vince immediately greeted me again. I wanted to be sure I made the right choice. I tried on a larger more expensive pair and he said they both work but the smaller ones are perfect for everyday wear. He suggested I keep the ones I got. I really appreciated that he didn't up-sell me. Turns out they don't work on commission, how amazing is that; I feel like I can breath unlike at other jewelry stores. Vince made great conversation during the whole experience. He offered to appraise the alexandrite ring I brought in for free. He had me examine my stone with a loop (10x magnifier) and I mentioned that I wish I had one. He helped me out with that too. This has been such a wonderful experience and it gets better! He also steam cleaned my old earrings and new ones. A free service with unlimited visits. I started to talk to Vince about my favorite watch brand Breitling and I asked him to show me some. He brought me over to the section and he pulled out one of the versions I was interested in. Wow, it was beautiful. I just had to get it. In a flash it was on my wrist and fully registered with a 5 yr warranty. He advised me to come in every year or two to get the pressure checked, again free of charge. I brought up a watch winder and he said I'm glad you brought that up, we have a few store models from a vender. He showed me how to use it and put it in my bag. Are you kidding me! It seriously keeps getting better! And Vince was absolutely the best, I would give him a million stars! This jewelry store is by far the best I've ever been in. The cleanliness, the free beverage and snack, the amazing customer service. I would recommend this place to everyone, absolutely the best service you can get. Good buy Tiffany, good buy everywhere else. This is now my go-to jewelry store and look out for Vince. They are all excellent, he is just my personal favorite.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x808561c3cc99e1b1:0x6a8a963fec593186</Gmap_id>< Rating>

Not only is he a walking Rolex and Panerai encyclopedia as well an overall watch expect, but he is a pleasure to do business with.  He knows and remembers his clients likes and taste and never disappoints.  Jeremiah is extremley professional and doesn't rush or pressure you with making a purchase. He's very patient explaining as much or little as you might want to know about a watch.

There are other non-authorized places to purchases watches on the internet nowadays, but I choose to buy from Jeremiah, he really turns what would otherwise just be another average purchase into a whole positive experience.

If I had to single out one specific part of the follow up service I appreciate the most, it would have to be there annual no charge Rolex refinishing, it's like getting a new watch ever year without spending any money...it's really one of the best value added follow up purchases I've seen in this industry.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
My wife and I have always been treated well here, even when we were "just looking". We bought a Rolex a number of years ago at their other Walnut Creek location. A few weeks ago we needed to have the band adjusted so we came back. To our surprise it wasn't there. We googled it and walked to the new location.

The new store is beautiful! We walked in with jeans and tennis shoes. We were immediately greeted and helped. While we waited we looked at their large selection of Rolexes. We met Jon Licht, the owner and Jeremiah, the in-house Rolex expert. We learned so much from him about the history of Rolex. Jon has a great sense of humor and gift of gab. We bought two Rolexes! While we were looking they offered to clean our rings and our watches. They cleaned and polished them for free.

We spoke with Jon about our 25th anniversary next year and our desire to have rings made for the special occasion. He put a $100K ring on my wife and walked away. Then I wore it walking around the store. When Jon came back we discussed different possible designs.

We were treated as if we were part of his family. We were not dressed well. We were not wearing a lot of expensive jewelry. We are gay. Sometimes other stores do not give us the time of day, so we just leave and find another store who will treat us with respect. We did not feel this way any time we entered this store.

I highly recommend shopping here.</Review>

Excellent detailed service.
Jeramiah and Jake were outstanding in going over procedures.
Owner Mr. Licht very personal. A nice touch when owners are involved and active. All staff spot on and sharp.
Very impressed with all aspects of their operation.
Product, service and facility.
Well done!!< /text>
