I highly recommend E Marketing Concepts to any small business who wants to improve the profile of their website and internet marketing outreach!  Their high level of Customer Service and attention to detail are unmatched and make this company a real pleasure to work with.  Our Project Manager, Niel Garcia, worked tirelessly to accomplish every task on time and definitely went the extra mile.  We could not be happier with E Marketing Concepts and plan to be working with them for a long time to come.</Review>

<text>eMarketing has been helping us with an SEO project over the course of the last few months. Our project manager Niel, and all of his colleagues, have been doing a tremendous job of sending progress reports and keeping us in the loop regarding their progress. I'd recommend their services to anyone looking to optimize their presence online.</text><time>1535155731341< /time><Rate>5<//Rate><user_name>Pieter Keushkerian<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

I would highly recommend their services!  I would specifically like to mention that Andre and Matthew have done an incredible job for me, and I cannot be more thankful for their efforts.  Whenever I talk to them, they are very professional with me, and I feel that they genuinely care about addressing my concerns.  I can say that this is a service where I really feel like I am being taken care of.  Thank you guys again!</Review>

Note to self to stick with what I know and people that I trust from previous work/project.  Thanks for the lazy work of just copying my old website information and putting it on top of a different client's website.  "Real Creative"....NOT!

If anyone reads this I would definitely recommend to go elsewhere if you want a new look and updated look for your business's website.</Review>< Pics>

We have a lot of tech-heavy competitors, with the "what's new" draw for marketing. It makes it so important for us to stay ahead of the curve on SEO if we want to remain competitive, and the team at eMarketing has done just that for us. Thanks so much!< /text>

Place is very bad. Recommended clients to them that I signed up. Never got the work that was promised. Made me look bad.

Edited:
Funny that you say 95% of the clients I signed up are still with you. Because when I asked about my commission check you said they cancelled. Yes I am an ex-employee. I brought in clients from my personal portfolio.</Review>

We have been VERY happy seeing how our website improved. I was hesitant to spend on external SEO before, but my partners got me to try it, and it was a good investment. We're growing more already with all the leads and conversions we've had. Special thanks to Preston, and thanks everyone at eMarketing Concepts.</Review>

We gave eMarketing Concepts one job, and one job only: get us on the first page for our unusually competitive niche keyword (kids unicycles, if you were curious), and they did a splendid job of it! As I like to say, "10/10, would recommend."</Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Finding a good marketing company is a lot like looking for a good relationship. Takes a few attempts, and you'll probably have a disaster or two along the way. But when you do finally find it, the trouble was worth it. More than one "SEO service" tried to take our money and run, and we had others that were alright, but not quite what we wanted. But it looks like the search is over! We're happy with what eMarketing Concepts has done.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>They do nothing...their strategy although has worked for others is what is called "black hat". You will see some results...wait until Google finds out and places a ban on your domain name. Panda and penguin are very intuitive.  You will be sent to the "sandbox" for penalty or be kicked off Google and out of business. Build listing citations on your own and create healthy reviews from your customers.<//Text>< response>

I don't do this kind of thing often, but the help I've had from eMarketing Concepts has really made a difference, and that's worth recognizing. We were really struggling with our online marketing, in part because we just didn't have anyone that tech-savvy on our team. The concept of meta descriptions and "alt tags" was confusing. eMC helped us figure it out and make our online presence an asset rather than the hassle it used to be. Much appreciated.<//text>

<Review>Tried many companies in the past. They all have failed miserably. I was talked in to giving this company a shot by friend who also works with them. I was surprised by the outcome to say the least. My lead flow has picked up tremendously and I have received a lot of new business as a result. I am glad my friend had a good experience and convinced me to try them. Highly recommend them to anyone who wants help with marketing.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I would not recommend this company. We paid them premium price for 2 companies for 13 months only to find our that nothing that was supposed to get done was. We started the process to go with a new company and they wanted our Google Analytical information...when we tried to get that from Emarketing we found out they never even set it up at all. So for the past year they took our money but didn't give what promised. This was just one of many items that they were contractually paid to provide and they didn't. Every time I try to contact them I get the runaround. Steer Clear!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>This company was really slick during the sales process. However once they charge you the set up fee and get you on board they disappear. It was extremely fustrating dealing with them. They did not deliver anything they said they would. Then when I wanted to cancel they never responded to my request and I had to file a dispute with amex.< /review>< Time>

Handling SEO was probably the most complicated part of my job, and now with eMarketing Concepts helping out, it has become the easiest. Feels good to finally be getting things done again!<//text>

Our boss initially wanted all our SEO to be done in house...but couldn't find anyone with SEO training or skills. It was a mess; we didn't know what was going on, or how to choose keywords or boost our rankings. After much wheedling, we got the boss to try an outside service, and eMarketing came to our rescue. The difference has been night and day. Thanks!</text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>OUTSOURCES TO PAKISTAN, horrible link quality, overpromises and under delivers, figured out they are formerly CAPTAIN MARKETING just re-branded. Read the reviews that aren't at the top of YELP. Scroll to the bottom and click the button to read the reviews that weren't posted to get a full picture of what kind of business they are.

I worked with E Marketing concepts for 4 months. I should of listened to my instincts when within the first week I had a notification that someone tried to login to my Google account from Pakistan. I was assured by my Project Manager that it hadn't came from their company so I changed my password and gave them another shot. Over the course of the next 4 months I had multiple logins from Pakistan even though they told me that everything was done "in house" HA!

These people are liars and crooks. They offered me free service eventually after I wasn't getting any traffic and my site was going down in rankings. I accepted and they STILL CHARGED ME THE FOLLOWING MONTH. I spoke with Matthew, the manager, who assured me a refund would be processed. The refund eventually was processed from my cc company in the form of a chargeback.

The social media is a joke! Why do I want a post saying "Mondaze"??? HOW IS THAT GOING TO HELP MY BUSINESS BECOME MORE VISIBLE ONLINE.

This company is full of it. They say they are Google Partnered but all that really means is they manage a certain amount of adwords budget. Don't be fooled.

My project manager did all he could but when you outsource your "Optimizations" to Pakistan, what can he really do?

STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY IF YOU WANT YOUR BUSINESS TO GROW and if you don't want to be blacklisted from Google's listings.</Review>< resp>

< Review>
I would NEVER recommend this company.  I hired them for both SEO and Social Media, they did some Social Media but did ZERO SEO services that they promised as follows:

Onsite Optimization

Incoming Links: 32  (NEVER GOT 1 LINK)
Web 2.0 links: 2  (NEVER GOT 1 LINK)
Keywords Tracked: 30 (NOTHING EVER CHANGED)
XML sitemap (I ALREADY PRODUCED THIS MYSELF WITH OUR OWN INTEGRATED PLUG-INS)

Homepage optimization (THEY NEVER MODIFIED MY HOMEPAGE AT ALL)
Homepage title tag  (AGAIN NEVER MODIFIED)
Homepage description  (AGAIN NEVER MODIFIED)
Hyperlink Optimization  (SO VAGUE BUT AGAIN THEY DIDN"T MODIFY ANYTHING ON OUR SITE FOR THAT MATTER)
Sitemap generation  (I ALREADY PRODUCED THIS MYSELF WITH OUR OWN INTEGRATED PLUG-INS)
Copyscape Review & Status Report  (NEVER SEEN ANY REPORT FROM COPYSCAPE)
Alt tags  (NOTHING DONE OUR SITE EVER, MAYBE SOME OTHER SITE, J UST NOT OURS)
Subpage title (Half in Month 1, Half in Month 2): 6  (NOTHING DONE ON OUR SITE)
Subpage description (Half in Month 1, half in Month 2): 6  (NOTHING DONE ON OUR SITE)
Directory submission and optimization: 20  (NEVER PROVIDED ANY LINKS OF ANY DIRECTORIES THEY SUPPOSEDLY SUBMITTED TO)
Map Embed  (NOTHING MODIFIED ON OUR SITE SO.....)
Google Local Verification  (DONT KNOW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IF THEY DID THIS)
Social media badge placement  (NOTHING MODIFIED ON OUR SITE AGAIN)
Google Publisher  (DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS IS, THEY NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT)
Facebook Likes (First month only): 10  (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)
Blog posting (Starts Month 2): 100 words (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)
Twitter posting (Starts Month 2): 2 (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)
Facebook posting (Starts Month 2): 2 (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)
Google+ posting (Starts Month 2): 2 (GOT THESE WITH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN WITH THEM)

They did do their social media like they outlined in our contract, however they did absolutely nothing on the SEO (what they call National SEO) side of our contract.

I was taken to the woodshed and filed a chargeback with AMEX only to be declined because AMEX didn't even know what SEO was.  EMarketing Concepts provided proof of what they did on the social media aspect and AMEX figured that was good enough.

BEWARE, BEWARE, BEWARE!  And if you DON"T LISTEN, don't say I DIDN'T WARN YOU!< /Review>

We went through a ton of SEO companies to find what we needed. But there was always a problem and we had to drop them; lacking the services we needed, subpar work, or out of our budget. But now it looks like eMarketing Concepts has solved our problems.</review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>I was solicited by an eMarketing Concepts telemarketer during October 2015.  I had 0 interest in his company's services.  He transferred me to a senior sales exec who gave me a special trial offer of service for 2 months at the price of 1 month.  Against my better judgment, I signed up for a Pinterest campaign for an established retail business and a Facebook campaign for a new separate business.  The senior sales exec assured me that the advertising would generate new leads for both businesses, the campaign managers would change the ads to get results, and I can end service on a monthly basis.

The manager for the Pinterest campaign was a veteran worker who created Pinterest boards with no problem, but since there were no sales I suspended the campaign when the 2 month trial ended.

I was initially paired with two managers for the Facebook campaign who were both new to the company.  They both took vacations within a week of being assigned to my account, didn't listen to my input, didn't provide me with a mock ad to approve, and ran low quality ads without my approval.  Before my 2 month trial ended, I was paired with a third manager who was one of the most experienced on staff.

The third manager did a much better job than the first 2 managers.  I wound up keeping the Facebook campaign going for another 3 months, but there were no results even though we tried different pictures, verbiage, new audiences, etc.  The effect was the same as rearranging deck chairs on a sinking Titanic.

The third Facebook manager also sold me on some minor services to tweak a business website like adding home page content (which I edited heavily) and a Word Press blog that I didn't need at all.

During the final month, I was billed for an incorrect amount.  To avoid refunding me, the third manager tried offering services like overpriced website blog posts and press releases but I declined.  After 3 weeks, the third manager couldn't tell me when I would be refunded.  I received a refund on the day my credit card company processed a charge back.

The senior sales exec was very smooth and reasonable-sounding.  I regret listening to her.  She said eMarketing is a major online marketer that will do great things for the 2 businesses I wanted to promote.  Both the senior sales exec and the third Facebook campaign manager said on the one hand they will generate a lot of online exposure that will lead to sales and on the other hand they can't guarantee results.  They can only perform work for their clients.

The Pinterest campaign required work, which I didn't have the time to do myself and I was unfamiliar with the Pinterest platform.  The Facebook campaign charged me for ads that I could have developed myself without paying eMarketing a monthly fee to work for me.

Since I hadn't tried Pinterest and Facebook advertising before, I decided to give eMarketing a try.

Unfortunately, all I did was waste my time and money.

If businesses have time and in house staff to develop their own online social media marketing campaigns, they're better off doing so rather than paying third parties to put out ads with no results.

eMarketing offered me free SEO service for 6 months in an effort to make amends for my dissatisfaction with its social media marketing.  After the nature of the temporary and permanent back links were explained to me, though, I decided to pass on the offer.  As I understood things, the temporary links with more business data were more effective at promoting a website’s online presence while the more permanent links which are picture based weren’t as effective at capturing the attention of Google search robots.

I’ve learned a few things about online advertising.  Online advertising can only attempt to increase a business’ web presence and/or potential consumer awareness.  Every form of online advertising I’ve tried hasn’t generated nearly enough leads to pay for the expense much less make a profit.  I’ll advertise myself from now on.</Text>< Pics>

We did refund you the money in the end because we wanted to be fair.\n\nAfter the refund, you left us a negative Yelp review. We did not believe this review was warranted because of the time your project manager dedicated to your campaign. I work with him closely and know the hours he spent on the phone with you and your website. At the end of the day we offered you free service because we wanted to make this work for you. You spoke with your project manager again and decided it wasn't something you wanted and instead left another negative review.\n\nYour website is ranked very well for your keywords, but people are not signing up for classes. Ultimately that was your goal and we did our best to get you results. Unfortunately, our service does not guarantee to get you sign ups, but we did get you great rankings.

Once these guys got our credit card info, they vanished for nearly 6 weeks. When we called to find out what was happening they said to wait for the first monthly report, which turned out to be nothing more than an assemblage of data we could get anytime from our Google Adwords account. It took several more weeks for them to 'get in touch' with their technicians to let us know what actions had been taken on the account, which was minimal. Dreadful customer service. They did not even reply to our request for a refund.<//Review>

Being Media  Media privleged  and  apart of the pits its awesome and hospitality been greatly shared.
The track wasnt ready this event putting delay to the event
But the tracks crew got it managed and provided a super pack for 360s non wings midgets to do their professional performances
As always Kyle  Larson
Takes the heat in qualifying.

A great dirt track raceway
3 hours too far to be my home track  to claim
Ocean is my track
Concessions  where costly  and plain menu
Still ill give a 5 for being available under this covid crack down epidemic  .< /review>

The people where nice and had a good time. The only thing wrong was lighting poles were rocking in the wind a lot. It looked like they would fall down on us. I  hope they fix them so no one gets hurt.</Text>

<review>Took me thirty years to get there, but to see CRA, was worth the wait. Plenty of parking, very typical fairgrounds. Could have been better signage for the entrance for the first timers. Will go again!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Watched the races one night. Had a good time. Typical local dirt track atmosphere. Basic food and drinks. Grass field parking lot at the fairgrounds. Won't be there every week but once or twice a season would be fun. Probably best with a group of friends/family.</review>< pictures>

Great family fun! The wooden seats need to updated, we got a couple of splinters. The bathrooms need some help as well, but overall a fun time!< /text>

<Review>We come over from Grover Beach a couple times a year. Outlaw sprints in April and Cotton Clasic in October. Camping is always mixed up but, we get it figured out. One of  my favorite dirt tracks in California. The D shaped oval allways has exciting sprint car racing.
Peace, Geo.< /Review>< pictures>

This is the place to be. Both of my kids are attending this tutoring center and I am planning to send my 3rd child here aswell. The tutors have a personal connection with the students which helps them to obey and respect. Very good center. This is in the heart of Old Town Torrance serving Torrance, Carson, Wilmington, San Pedro and near by cities.</review>

This is a nice place for kids to learn. Authentic uncorrupted values for the new generation. Kudos to the administration for trying hard. By the way, it is nice to be able to pray on Friday in a apolitical environment. I pray and hope you can grow according to your vision Thanks!<//Text>

<text>My child went here for preschool and Kindergarden. She loved all her teachers dearly. Mrs. Nadia don't work there anymore but we were very fortunate to have her for our child's first year of school. She went above and beyond to work with kids at individual level. Sister Carolina was always available whenever I reached out for any concern. I loved her approach of handling matters. She wanted to do great things for this school. I hope all that happens. We need good Muslim schools with dedicated teachers.</text>< Rate>

This is a beautiful, well organized school with kind staff members. A nice, inviting, kid-friendly place for your child to study...

I really love this academy and I am giving it five stars because it is one of the best I have seen so far..........

Finally a school where moms can send kids , and relax with a cup of tea at home. ☺ curriculum is better then the blue ribbon schools in O.C  where my kids went . preschool looks georgous with kids friendly decor yet fully equipped. Much needed school for the area!!!<//text>

Al Sajdah is located at a prime location benefitting the Muslim community in Torrance as well as those residing in neighbor cities. The completion of successful two years is the best proof of highest level of school teaching & religious atmosphere. Inshallah AlSujdah Academy will earn outstanding recognition from all in the near future.<//Text>

Mashallah I attended a hajj seminar at this masjid last year. The knowledge imparted by Br Ahmed and the shaykh was extremely beneficial and very practical. I could not have performed hajj properly without it. Also like the full sunnah environment in this masjid. Such an environment is difficult to find in LA.< /Review>

The school provides an excellent and very healthy islamic atmosphere for the children to learn Islamic beliefs and values and also offers a unique and innovative methodology of delivering wordly subjects like maths, science and foreign languages.

Overall, an excellent place to lay the foundation of well rounded muslim individuals.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Alhandulilah their is a tajweed course that takes place over here from Monday through Thursday between asr and magjrib led by a very reliable Alim. The course is open to all ages and the best part is it's free except for the book which cost $3 but it is partial amount to pay compared to the knowledge you again. They also have jumah here and the 5 times daily salat ad well.< /Review>< pics>

<pics>None< /pics><text>I called two days in advance to schedule a hair cut and was told to call before I came in to the shop. But when I got there a had to wait for 3 people in front of me I told the manager or owner no problem but then another customer walk in and he put him in front of me. I had been wait already for over an hour. This is not the first time that this happens at this barbershop. Well if you are willing to wait for over hour and half or even longer this maybe the shop for you but I will no longer visit or recommend this shop to anyone. Thank you Luis for answering, Willy is a great barber with lots of customers but I dont think that he knows how to manage his time or schedule customers.<//text>< gmap_id>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I have extensive experience with chiropractors all across the US and have probably seen over 50 of them. Each has their own unique style which can differ greatly. Dr. Kim is THE BEST.

He has a kind, gentle manner and explains his process before treatment. He takes his time and does not try to pad his practice with what I have found to be unnecessary elements. He gives directed and powerful adjustments that assist the body to function at its best. He understands and practices in the true spirit of Chiropractic which is to facilitate healing.

I recommend him highly and without reservation to anyone who has never had an adjustment as well as to anyone who is experienced with chiropractic. You will be happily surprised at how much better, taller, calmer, more centered and energetic you feel after each adjustment with Dr. Kim. Best wishes to all!<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I’ve been to many many chiropractors in my life and I finally found the one that has completely changed my life. I’m so so thankful to have found Dr.Kim and his staff to help me with my whole body pain. Thank you so much for saving my life Bc that’s how I truly feel. Now my body is getting better and better even my mind have changed Bc I’m so much happier and at peace now. I am so grateful and blessed everyday to have a place who truly cares about your well being and want YOU to feel the best in your body.
This place is the best and one and only Place I will go to get adjusted and treatment!
I decided I’m not even going to move and stay here because it was THAT difficult to find a chiropractor who is absolutely amazing like Dr.Kim is.
Thank you again for everything!<//Review>

Dr Woo is extremely professional, passionate, and knowledgeable about what he does. He has had many years in this profession and I would actually prefer to see him. Unfortunately, I moved to San Bernardino county for work and had to find a new chiropractor. But if I am ever in the Los Angeles area, I will definitely drop by to make a walk in appointment with him. He is phenomenal! He is also very supportive of veterans and our US service members. :)< /review>

I was so skeptical at first because several doctors and massage sessions were not able to help me with the upper back pain. But Dr. Kim has got me from the worst pain to feeling more relaxed and being able to take a deep breath. I overall feel amazing and can't wait for my next visit. Also Dr. Kim treats whole body unlike other chiropractors I've searched about that treat just a specific area.</review>

<Review>A Caring Doctor with a passion to help patients. It's the highlight of my day being adjusted after sitting down at the office all week long.
His approach and skills were exactly what I (and my lower back) was looking for.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I absolutely adore Dr. Wu. He makes you feel so welcome! I been coming every week for about 2 months, I had terrible digestive issues (burping, gastric reflux etc.). I had seen many specialists to no avail, and Dr. Wu helped me so much! I no longer have those issues whatsoever. I also never did chiro before him so I was so nervous, but it is literally something I look forward to weekly now. He is so nice and sincerely cares about his patients and community! HIGHLY recommend!< /review>< Pics>

Bless Dr Woo for being a warm, compassionate, honest, and comical. God sent healer. Not only is he transparent with his practice, and methods; he is very detailed oriented, and educational when it comes to his treatment plan based off of your assessment. I also really appreciate the way he handled me during the adjustment, making me feel included in the healing process. I highly recommend him for anyone who is seeking incredibly affordable prices and budget plans, with the quality of care & information he provides.<//text>

Dr. Kim is an expert and wise man in his field. I'm from Tokyo, Japan and when I try to book his service online, I had problems and couldn't book it. However, when I came in without an appointment, he was willing to help me and make sure I was well taken care of. From a Master to another, I greatly respect him and his work. I would recommend Dr. Woo to anyone and I will always come support him when I come back to visit U.S.A again. Thank you very much again Dr. Kim for all your kindness and healing me.</Text>

< review>
First time with this chiropractor, I’ve been trying couple other chiropractors and this one was no disappointment. Very friendly staff, easy access and parking. The Dr. was very thorough and explained what he would adjust. The adjustment was quick, pain free and very relieving. He’s affordable and had options for different budgets. Highly recommended</review>

<text>I took my mom to get adjusted here. She has Parkinson's disease and so we were looking for a way to have her body relax more and overall feel better. I have to honestly say that getting the adjustments really helped her. It didn't cure her obviously, but she was much more relaxed and lively than usual. I think it helped improve her mood as well. I would definitely recommend others to come here and get adjusted!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c79f210f3fbf:0x5db218cf1c8d9f4a< /Gmap_id><rating>5< /rating>< Resp>

<review>1st best thing about this chiropractor center is that they actually have parking and it's free. Reception is kind, and Dr. Woo is the best. Right from the start he gave me a very warm welcome. His adjustment was quick and felt great. He explained his philosophy for his practice at the end of my visit and it made me feel like he genuinely cares about his patients rather than just trying to sell me a treatment plan. He is a spiritual man who believes in healing and helping people. Whether you believe in God or nothing at all, you can believe that Dr. Woo will do his best to help you. He offers treatment that is both affordable and convenient. Please give him a try.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Dr. Woo made my very first experience at a chiropractor great! He was warm, patient, explained everything, and made sure I didn't have any questions before we got started.
The adjusting wasn't painful at all and everything went very quickly.
I saw him adjust a few other patients, all of with whom he was extremely friendly and caring as well.
On top of that, he's got a big heart and lets your kids get free adjustments until they're 10 years old in an effort to prevent scoliosis. Now, how awesome is that?
Wonderful experience! Definitely recommend him 10/10.</Review><username>Jennifer Schlueter</username><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>105003119178151707466</UserId.>< Response>

I came  here last Friday and never felt this good with my first visit. Dr Woo  is very detailed with his treatment and listened to all my concerns which he made the necessary adjustment during my first visit. I am definitely coming back here again. Dr. Woo is also very friendly and makes the adjustments necessary to feel better. I am definitely coming back soon.< /review>

< Review>
I just wanted to take a few minutes to thank the doctors Kim at Los Angeles Chiropractor. I have been to many other chiropractic offices over the years and had varied results from treatment. I was looking for a chiropractic office that I could call home. I liked the family friendly atmosphere on the website. I was looking for a place to bring my kids as well. As mom, I am always looking at value for my family. Los Angeles Chiropractor provides affordable and great program not only for me, but my entire family. The chiropractic care has made a huge difference in how i feel every day. My kids are in school band and theater programs which cause them to be in bad positions and get injured form time to time. I am so happy I found this place and I love the friendly doctor and staff. Kathy Han< /Review>

I've been going to the chiropractor since I was a baby. I moved and didn't have a chiropractor here. I tried out all the groupons but either they weren't that good or were outrageously expensive ($150 a pop!) . Dr. Kim is so good at his job and affordable. I'm a nurse but believe in the power of complementary medicine with adequate research behind it.</text>

<Review>I've been coming for more than 4 years and it has changed my life. As a child I was in automobile accident with my mother. Thu, caused me to have a severe and mild chronic neck pains. They would effect my life forcing me to take painkillers almost everyday. After, getting my adjustment from here from a amazing chiropractor if not the best and most honest; I'm able to work out, work, study, and live my life pain free and not relying on painkillers.</Review>< Resp>

Found Dr. Kim just by chance searching online. I have a pinched nerve on the back of my right shoulder and I haven't been able to turn my head too far to the left in almost 2 years! My insurance doesn't cover chiropractic care so I never did anything about it. But the pain was getting worse so I went searching and found him. Thank God for him! I can finally turn my head and every part of me feels so much better! And this was just the first adjustment! His prices are soooo affordable I can actually go back! And bonus...he's so nice and funny! You won't be disappointed!<//Review>

I love how Dr. Kim's treatments are so fast, efficient and effective.  I already feel like with his help my body is on it's way to healing itself.  Come to think of it, I used to experience terrible headaches.  Since I have had two treatments with Dr. Kim a few weeks ago I haven't had a single one. I'm so thankful for his help and his commitment to making Chiropractic accessible.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Dr. Joseph Kim is a very gifted and kind person. He adjusted my spine in 3 additional ways that no chiropractor has ever done before. I saw several other chiropractors before coming to Dr. KIm. With the others, I left the office feeling like I still had some vertebrae that were "stuck". But after seeing Dr. Kim I felt like I had regained all the mobility back in my neck, back, hips and shoulders. Additionally, he was by far the most affordable chiropractor that I had seen. He is also very involved in the community, offering spinal evaluations and free adjustments to underprivileged youth in the LA county. When someone truly believes in what they are doing, and loves doing it, they share it with others, and that is what Dr. Kim does. Looks like I found a chiropractor that I'm going to stick with.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I would just like to take a moment to recognize this budding business. The atmosphere is peaceful and most definitely family-friendly. While a little hidden, from the moment you arrive you are given priority by the reception staff, who will seat you and have you wait for your turn with Dr. Kim. Dr. Kim is extremely kind and cares leaps and bounds about making his new customers comfortable. I was not sure what to expect because I was referred to the business by a discount website which provided me with varying results, but this purchase was definitely worth it. Dr. Kim adjust the whole body; afterwards, I was definitely relaxed, and the stiffness in my neck and right shoulder were definitely mediated. Unlimited chiropractic has a nice staff, great pricing, and provides a great service. I will definitely be going again in the future.<//Review>

I've had back problems from lifting for the longest. I've been to many chairopractors in LA. It was a waste of money and time. Now that I met Mr.Woo I'm not going anywhere else. He does an amazing job. Highly recommend him.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I visited with my husband. I was just very skeptical at first, but after treatment, I noticed that my body improved.
Teacher is great!

Great Service !!! Went in for a oil change and some store shopping. It was quite convenient and affordable. There was no Up Sell Sales Pressure. Nothing but a Quick, Affordable Oil Change. Got most of my shopping done and my car was ready before I knew it.< /text>

<Text>I hate calling this Walmart's auto department. They never answer the phone. When they do, you're on hold forever. Extremely bad customer service. I absolutely hate going to this Walmart. I live in Stockton and would rather drive to Walmart in Delta Shores then deal with this location!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
"The manager at auto center Walmart hummer lane not come to talk with customers and not responsible also the supervisor over there he so RUDE! His name is Willian"

I did go to oil change and they recommended to rotation, I did it. Then my car make sound and see the tire pressure low but it not. And I came to ask them they said I need to balance ok I do balanced.

"The point is when I rotation they change all the rear to the front. And I do the balance they just change the front to the rear back"
so it exactly the same before I go to rotation and balance. That's crazy,  I try to explain about that too but they not responsible,the supervisor over there he so RUDE! His name is Willian.</review>

I wanted for over 15 minutes to get checked in and they continued to check other people who got there after me in before me. Rude employees. I’d rather spend more money than step foot here again.<//text>

Tire center is a joke. If you call, a girl answers the phone and she can't even remember a tire size long enough to write it down. Next, she says "I can't quote you on a tire with out knowing the speed rating  your car has" well if you asked for the vehicle info or the speed rating then we would be in business. Once all of this horsing around was done, she proceeds to tell me $200 for two tires, so I asked if that was installed or just the tires themselves to which she replied "I'm not sure"
So all in all, I needed 4 tires not just 2 and i had a 30 minute conversation over the phone for no good information. No thanks.<//text>

I bought new tires from Walmart a few months ago and one of them developed a bubble. I first went to the Lodi location on 6/12 where the service manager stated that with out looking at the tire he knew I had hit a curb or drove over a pot hole which caused this. This was not true. He walked over to the car he took a quick look with out removing the tire and said to bring it back this Thursday. I wasnt happy with his service since he was already starting I was at fault with out properly inspecting the tire. On 6/13 I took the vehicle to the stockon location where I waited for about three hours, but they took care of me they inspected the tire and found out it was a manufacture defect. I was very pleased that they didn't just assume and instead actually inspected the tire. I have purchased three sets of tires from Walmart and will continue to do so. Thanks Stockton team great job you guys were really busy but still managed to take care of my issue.< /Text>

Horrible customer service! When we pulled in a man said he'd be right with us. We waited outside of the car for 15 minutes, another car pulled in and was obviously friends with an employee and got served right away, while we still stood there waiting. I asked what was going on and i was ignored. So rude, so we left and went to jiffylube down the street. Where they know how to treat their customers. Only a few bucks more for good service. Recommend you all go to jiffy over walmart for sure! Walmart was so rude, i will never go back!< /text>

$20 dollar oil change is a good thing, but when they make you wait 2HRS when there's only one car ahead is NOT
You're better off changing your own oil and actually putting a good oil or paying extra 10 dollars elsewhere and only wait 10 minutes
It's ridiculous<//Text>

<text>Clean, neat, with new machines. They're nice and polite. Last wash is 10:15 pm. Single, triple loads and giant dryer is available. Parking is limited but the neighborhood would be a good place to park your car. There are two change machines. Carts are really clean and as you see in one the photos they have clean or dirty cart label.
Overall, I really like the place.< /text>< pics>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!! I've gone here for a couple months due to convenience and at this point I'm totally fed up. Last time I was here the washer stopped working halfway through and I tried opening and shutting the door multiple times only to see that it wasn't doing anything. I hit the stop button in hopes of restarting it but it did nothing. The employee then told me I'm going to need to put in another $6, which is absolutely ridiculous.

This time, I got here at 10:16, and I was turned away as their signs now say last wash at 10:15. Employee couldn't careless about it. This place is total trash. Management is trash. Parking lot is trash. And most of all the customer service is trash.</Review>< UserId.>

The better coin laundries on the Westside. You can drop your clothes off for washing and folding they charge by the pound. Last watch is around ten 10:30 p.m. is 2 TVs monitors so you can watch the games while washing. Machines are always kept very clean.< /text>

Have been coming here since they open. Like that they have excellent staff available if you need help. Washers and dryers (very hot) are great! Have energy saver machines (not enough water), top loaders excellent & best value ($2.00). Double & triple loaders are the best, lots of water to really clean your clothes. The place and machines are clean mostly day and night. Last wash 10:30 pm. Only negative, expensive at $5.25 for double loaders. Fluff & fold available; and they do care how they handle your clothes. If you can take the price point, it's the best laundramat in the area. Highly Recommend!< /Text>

Nice place to do laundry.
The cheapest wash is 2.50 for 30 minutes, and the dryers are in increments of 25 cents. All of the machines work well.

The place has tables and also wifi so you can work/study while waiting. I also like how there is a small vending machine of laundry products in case you forget yours at home.<//Review>

Always clean, rarely crowded, can usually get a parking space, in a mini mall with a liquor store and a goodwill book store so you can get a snack, drop off your old stuff and pick up a book to read!  Wifi is fast and free, managers are super nice and helpful if you need help but leave you alone otherwise. Only dropped one star because sometimes there are some less-than-favorable people in there, i.e. drunk homeless guy looking everyone up and down and talking to himself, but hey, it's a laundromat....</review>

<text>Nothing sparkling about this place. Stoned employee damaged my car and owner (Garg G) refused to take responsibility. He refused to release video footage of his cousin/employee pushing metal hangers against my car. It took getting a detective to call him to admit that his employee did do damage to my car. Parking lot is also a dangerous place for criminal behavior. Attendant on weekdays is really rude and would not do anything whenever scary men would harrass women around premises. Finally I recovered the money through small claims which judgement later had to be enforced since Gary refused to pay. Found a better laundromat who won't damage my property in the process.<//text>< username>

If you don't mind scarce parking, expensive machines, being discriminated for being white, and bad service then it's ok.

I used to do my laundry here. They raised their prices so high. I asked for change for a $5. The clerk walked me over and pointed at a sign that says "no change." But they gave a Latina woman change.

Small top load washers are $2.50, medium size $5.25,  dryers only run 6 - 7 min. per 25c. Me and my neighbor stopped doing our laundry here years ago.< /review>

i only go there because of the location washing machines are way over priced and there are washing machines that are the same size but different prices. best part of the place is they give free chips all day long. Otherwise you have to deal with little to no parking and no room really to maneuver around the actual laundry mat. workers are friendly but do tend to stare a lot which is weird and very uncomfortable at times and they use up a lot of space in the back for the people that do the drop off service.< /review>

Great place if you looking for CLEAN washing and drying machines. I been coming to this laundromat for 6 years. Im a local family man, and im always precautions with my children clothes, as any family person is. Best advice, come in early for parking since its share with other stores.<//Text>

I typically would go midday during the week when it wasn't too busy. They have different size machines too, which was convenient when a kitten peed on my bedding and I had to launder bulky items that wouldn't fit into my home machine.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Review>Worse than POOR, but they don't offer that rating!!  If you people don't know this, owners of laundromats can SET the spin speeds of their washers! These guys set them to the LOWEST spin speed which makes your clothes come out SOAKING wet. This not only costs you a FORTUNE in drying time and wasting YOUR time, but it's really hard on your clothes. The guy/owner was REALLY pissy when I showed him that I could wring water out of my clothes after the was cycle was over. He was VERY rude and didn't want to do anything until I pushed the issue. He finally reached in my machine and had it spin for a couple more minutes. The problem was it was STILL a slow speed spin, so it didn't help much. As another customer said, their dryers SUCK and are not well maintained. They have varying temps, some "almost hot" some just warm.  FIND ANOTHER LAUNDROMAT! Save your TIME AND MONEY as they are ripping you off BIG TIME! Educate yourself, ask them what their spin speeds are set at. If they BS you, move on to another laundromat. If you can WRING water out of your clothes when the wash is done, they are RIPPING YOU OFF as this guy is doing!   They have washers that spin at 1,400 RPM for HOME use, this guy probably has them set at 800! FIGURE OUT THE MATH and what it's costing you in drying time, your time and wear/tear on your clothing!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>My favorite hoodie was in desperate need of a washing, and I pulled into this place on a whim. Needless to say, I was quite satisfied to find that apparently, I'd stumbled across the best laundromat in all of Los Angeles.

Within the first 10 minutes of arriving, I was offered a private restroom to change, free wi-fi, entry into a beach cruiser drawing, free bags of chips to snack on. Beyond all of that, and most important, a helpful and pleasant demeanor from the staff.

I don't laundromat often, but when I so, I will forever drive from anywhere in the city to make it happen at Sparkling Coin.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
A great dental experience! Hadn't been to a dentist in about 3 years and ending up with Dr. Mitch was awesome.
He explained everything that was happening, was extremely transparent (a breath of fresh air from past dental experiences) and showed and explained his thoughts and findings to me via video.
I wouldn't hesitate to refer anyone here.< /Review>

Dr. Wechsler is the finest dentist I’ve ever been to and I’ve been to quite a few. He gives the best shot that you barely even feel and has a wonderful personality. It’s just a pleasure to be in his chair I can’t even believe I’m saying this and his staff also 5 Star.< /text>

Everyone in the office is friendly. Dr. Mitch is great! He has great bed side manners. He takes the time to talk to you and explain what needs to be done. During my procedure he always asked if I was ok and not in any discomfort. Another great asset of Dr. Mitch is that he doesn’t try to upsell procedures you do not need. He is honest and professional!<//Text>

They truly care about each patient that comes through their door. Attention to detail is an understatement. As a person that fears the dentist I can say without a doubt that Legacy Dentals patient care is #1!! They take the time to get to know you as a person and explain what is going on so you are put at ease while in the chair.

<user_name>Gail Matulaitis<//user_name><Date>1611590823195<//Date><Rating>5<//Rating><text>My experience today was super long, but I have to say that it was totally bearable because of Dr. Mitch, Christina and Donna.  Donna is always so sweet, kind and accommodating; Christina very capable, comforting and also extremely kind. And Dr. Mitch: today when I left i felt like I had received the very best dental care I could get, and have the utmost confidence in my treatment plan. I felt like I was in the hands of an expert, a true artist, particularly when he was making the temporary crowns fit, and choosing the color shades for the crowns. He took so much time and effort, until he got it just right. I appreciate them all, and would highly recommend them to family and friends.  THANK YOU!

This is a continuation of my previous post--not sure why I'm not able to post properly.  So I once again felt like I received the very best dental care I could get and that I was dealing people who really care about my dental health. Donna, as always, was very sweet and kind. Jennifer, the dental assistant, also was fantastic, and Dr. Mitch did a beautiful job.  I have a new smile now, one I haven't had in many years. I appreciate all of you and wish you the best.  I'll see you in a couple of months for a cleaning.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
By far the best dentist in Simi Valley, in my opinion.
This visit I did have to wait a bit once I arrived.
But I know he was with another client.
Just give me the TV remote, next time :)< /Review>

<review>Very, very, rarely do I write reviews, HOWEVER, in this case I am compelled to do so, and couldn't ever imagine that I would do one for a dentist!  Doctor, staff, office, work and service were excellent.  Could I have rated them more than 5-stars, I would, they deserve it.<//review>< name>

I had an emergency with tooth pain over the weekend , I called Monday morning ( even though I knew they would be booked ) and they fit me in to resolve the problem . It ended up to be a root canal so Dr. Mitch and the staff set me up right away . Great Work Legacy you learned from the BEST.</text>

<review>Dr is very thorough. the staff is friendly, safety minded, and professional.

I wish I would have found this dentist years ago.

I just had major work done on my teeth and I am a wimp when it comes to pain!

The Dr worked in my mouth for an hour and it was great!

I am sold on using Him for my entire family of 5!</review>< GmapID>

Let me just say this, since I was a kid I’ve been afraid of the dentist. I’m 26. This was the nicest visit I’ve ever had. I was constantly asked if I was okay, if anything hurt. Everything was done so gently. And I really appreciate that. Thank you so much to the Dentist and assistants.<//review>

<username>Mrs. H<//username><Text>Dr. Mitch is a fantastic dentist, and his staff is the best…seriously!  He has a professional…yet fun personality.  My family and I are long time patients of his at his office in Lancaster. He’s booked up months in advance in the Lancaster office. I wanted to utilize my yearly insurance maximum to the fullest, so when I was given the option to make an appointment in his Simi Valley office to get in sooner...I was thrilled!
Apparently, the word hasn’t spread yet to the Simi Valley residents that there’s a great “family style” dentist in their community. If you’re searching for a quality dentist, your search is over.< /Text>< Rate>

Really really happy we found this office! Dr Mitch is so kind and seems like he genuinely cares about his patients. He made sure myself and my kids felt comfortable and was sure to inform us of everything before he moved forward. Looking forward to being a patient of his for the long haul.<//Review>

Had a front tooth break off 2 nights ago (it had a root canal many years ago, different dentist). Pretty ugly smile now... thought I'd have to cancel some upcoming biz meetings.

Dr. Mitch got me in right away (had a cancellation), and I will need an implant, which takes several months, at least. I figured I'd learn how to smile with my mouth closed, but Dr. Mitch used the old tooth to create a comfortable temporary device, and now you can't even tell what happened! To say the least, I am thrilled!!
No pain or discomfort too!!

Dr. Mitch is amazing. Always meticulously careful, offering all options (good or bad), and giving sound and prudent advice. Beautiful new office, great staff, and did I mention the free coffee? What's there to think about? You'll be glad you chose Legacy Dental Group.<//text>

After doing endless amounts research on a reliable dentist in my area I came across Legacy Dental. I figured I’d give them a try after being referred by multiple people. I am so glad I did. The relationship started off great when Donna answers the phone. She was so accommodating and did everything possible to fit me in knowing that I had a broken filling that was causing a ton of discomfort. Once I got to the office the experience got even better. Dr. Mitch made me feel comfortable right away. He was extremely professional and told me everything he was doing and why he was doing it. My tooth was fixed in a timely manner and the problem was solved.  I will continue to go to Legacy Dental for many years to come, even if I have to drive from Thousand Oaks. If you are anywhere near the Simi Valley area and looking for an honest and reliable dentist office please do yourself a favor and check out the Legacy Dental Group. You won’t be sorry.</Text>

<Review>The only thing that irritates me is that I didn’t go to Legacy sooner! They really showed me what it’s like to have a great dentist. Dr. Mitch had to fix fillings that my old dentist did poorly! So it’s nice to finally feel confident about the work I’m having done. I couldn’t be happier with the staff. Honest and knowledgeable dentists make the difference. Plus he referred me to an amazing orthodontist who’s helping me perfect my smile with Invisalign. It’s a great network of dental professionals.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I always have so much anxiety over going to the dentist - I end up putting it off til it absolutely can’t wait any longer just because I’ve had so much nerve pain and overall bad dental experiences in the past. Dr Mitch is far and away the best dentist I’ve ever been to. He is kind, knowledgeable, gentle, reassuring and proficient. He saved a tooth of mine that had a large filling and was beginning to crack and decay from going to a root canal and I had zero pain during the whole process. His bedside manner is excellent and he constantly made sure I had no pain during the procedure. I trust him completely and really feel that he has my best interest at heart and is not just trying to make a buck (like I have felt from so many other dentists). I really cannot recommend him enough - the staff was also very kind and reassuring.</text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I first visited Dr. Mitch Wechsler's office as a result of a very painful dental emergency. He was able to schedule an appointment with an outstanding endodontist, for an emergency root canal, that very evening. Recently, I returned to Dr. Wechsler's office to have the tooth crowned.

I found Dr. Wechsler and his staff to be very friendly and technically skilled. A very pleasant dental experience from start to finish. The office is extremely clean, comfortable, and well organized. Pricing and insurance coverage were very clearly explained. The COVID-19 safeguards that he and his staff have put in place are extremely stringent. I feel confident that their processes put us both at the least risk possible. Dr. Wechsler is very thorough and sure-handed. He seems very well-versed in the most recent dental techniques and equipment. He took the time to explain the entire process at the level of detail that I desired. Both he and his staff really care about the comfort of their patients. A truly refreshing dental experience that I highly recommend. I'm confident that this is the best dental care that I've ever received.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>Dr. Mitch is TRULY the best. He is so professional and gentle with your teeth no matter what procedure you are having done. I had to get not one but two crowns, and it was the smoothest process. The teeth with the crowns felt like my original teeth when I walked out the door, no discomfort, no sensitivity, nothing. Try going to Legacy Dental Group, and I promise you will never go to another dentist again!< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Dr. Mitch is great!  He is gentle and thorough, patient and kind.  And an Artist at his trade!  He always makes me feel comfortable during my appointments and always explains what he is doing, and what needs to be done; including any potential issues that may be disclosed.  I have recommended Dr. Mitch to my Sister; we both were subjected to a 'credit dentist' as children where there was a lot of pain and discomfort.  Dr. Mitch's concern for my well being during procedures dispels my nervousness and makes each appointment go smoothly.  I am so comfortable with him, I decided when I moved that I would travel the 2 1/2 hours to see him!

Rosie is the best assistant!  She always sees that I am comfortable and is conscious of my needs as well, for Xrays, preparation for treatment and just in passing.  This special attention and her cheerful attitude help to ease my nervousness.

Donna handles all the insurance and appointments, and does this with a smile on her face.  She knew how my insurance worked better than I did!  She is always listening to my needs, and setting appointments around my schedule.  I see Dr. Mitch in the Simi Valley office, but she is able to remote from Lancaster and take care of any issues or questions I might have.

While they work as a great team, it is more of a family atmosphere.  I feel quite comfortable there.  My recommendation is for anyone nervous about dental procedures:  Seniors, adults or children.  Ten stars in my book!</text>< pictures>

You're not going to find a more professional, respectful, or caring dentist out there, guaranteed!  When you walk in to the office, you're treated like family. Without getting into too much detail, I've had several visits recently to remove silver fillings from my teeth that I've had since I was a kid. Needless to say, the process has involved some needles and drilling, yet Dr. Mitch did everything he could to ensure I was comfortable, and pain free the whole time. With his new high tech office, he's able to take digital photos of the entire procedure, which he shows me immediately, AND every patient room is Roku equipped, so you can select a movie to watch during the entire visit.  To top it all off, Dr. Mitch even calls me a few hours later following each appointment, just to check in and make sure I wasn't experiencing any residual pain or complications. I can't recommend this office enough!</Text>

It was a yummy breakfast burrito but they were out of a lot if things. No potatoes (for a breakfast burrito this was surprising) and no green sauce.</review>

First time. Had torta de milanesa(breaded steak). It was the Super torta. The breaded steak is for the most part thin but this one was over doing it... No flavor in the torta. The salsa was bland.... First and last time at this place.< /text>

This place is awesome! We order from Grubhub.

The carnitas family meal is perfect for us. It comes with carnitas, rice, beans, tortillas and roasted jalapeños and onions.  Carnitas are super moist (not like the dry, week old stuff at some markets). The rice tastes nice and fresh. My kids and husband devoured everything (my kids are picky eaters). Definitely recommend!<//text>

The food was disgusting the carne asada had a lot of fat in it and it was flavorless. The location had a B on the window and the girl taking my order was rude. After eating a few bites of this food my son felt sick. What a waste of money!!!🤬</review>

Wait more than 30 minutes for a cake and a plate of hamon with rings and the truth that when I started eating I regretted aver bought in that place. The cake was very salty and full of cheese. I never ate a cake where they filled it with cheese. The plate of arros with hamon is not said, the ham well burned the arros without flavor .... Really disappointment.

<text>Xolo is nearly always a delight. Super fast, delicious, quality Mexican food, either delivery or on-site. One downside of success--they're making their crispy tacos ahead of time, and they don't always completely thaw during frying.< /text>< userid>

Absolutely amazing tacos! Some of my favorite in Oakland. They have a selection of drinks and beer. The restaurant itself is very large although during COVID there is only a small amount of outdoor seating.<//Text>

<review>Lied about menue price . Took  15 minutes to drive there and had a order from 7 people just to find out they charge extra for everything u order and don't honor their price online. Even have a delivery service that has same prices but wouldn't honor it . Asked for owner and manager and lady said to bad cause they aren't there and won't be until tomorrow.  Rude service and fake prices.  Highly don't recommend< /review></record></dataset><record>

I always come to Xolo for lunch. I love the side salad and cheese quesadillas. The food is fresh, delicious, and full of flavor. I’ve never tried the tacos but I’ve heard they are magical. Don’t look at the negative reviews without looking at the positive reviews. Xolo is a great restaurant with a lot of heart and soul.</Review>

Can’t say enough good things about Xolo’s. The quality is consistently great and the food is truly filling and leaves you more than satisfied. The burritos are top notch.< /Text>

Classic tacos.   had the Al Pastor and the Chile Verde.   Al Pastor was a bit greasy but really tasty.    Chile Verde was a bit salty, but also really tasty.
Both had so much meat on them they were a bit tricky to pick up, but nice thick double corn tortillas held them together nicely.   Great place for a quick cheap bite before a show at the Fox< /review>

My only thing is the burritos are not as big as I would like them to be, and they do not have a salsa bar and charge extra for salsa on the side with your food. Other than that I would give this place a five star review, because I love the decorations of the place and they have really high ceilings and have seating upstairs and outdoor seating.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP18D2pSHHwTaUB9H6NPYlComjvZMCOFAr18JJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-f9ejvAXv4QhZ2j1g9WIQWFPFFZ-IoQ7uiczs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_qSEGsTHBMWwc_o2ZEr7If49GMKPgce1P_KAR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0xx9B6WVc0GIcKcuU4SC8n0fnHS3sttDA7gXM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
The tacos were delicious, and ready and brought to the table so unbelievably quickly! I tried the beef and the chicken tacos. They just melted in the mouth. They were loaded up with meat and onions and cilantro. Other people were happy Witt their tacos, including shrimp. The menu isn’t huge, but it offered a good selection of burritos and tacos, with a good selection of beverages. There’s plenty of seating. The bathroom was clean, which is always a good sign for the place overall. The staff were friendly. The place was busy pretty late on  a weekday, but not too loud to have a conversation. I’d want to try more before giving it five stars, but I’m definitely open to the possibility. They also have a big bike rack out front, so bonus points for that! It’s close to BART.<//Review>

Very cool taqueria tucked away in a shop front. Its a la carte menu is pretty extensive but everything we had was delicious! The only thing that sucks is finding seating, which there is plenty of but someone has to then find your table to being the food. As well if you need another drink you have to get back in line. The atmosphere is totally worth it though, especially where we sat in the back outside.</Text>

<Text>Stopped in for breakfast.  The machaca tostada was AWESOME - great flavor, could have been a little spicier but I would definitely get it again.  Staff was friendly, everything was clean and spacious.</Text>< Pictures>

This is Central American food at its finest. The California spin is even better. Vegan, gluten free, etc. Options are available, and delicious. I'll be coming here for lunch often.</Review>

<text>I went back a two days after my first visit...great tacos!! The prices are fantastic and the tacos are stuffed.

My order was quick coming out and the staff were friendly and helpful. Good vegan & gf options (hongos tacos!).

Sitting upstairs offers a great view of Telegraph, but if it's a hot day be prepared to be a little hotter up there. The back patio seating is chill and a great place to sit and talk.

Definitely recommend!</text>< Pics>

I recently moved back to California and one of the biggest things I was excited about is finding my new taco spot. Well, Xolo is the place. I probably come here once a week and I don’t even live in Oakland anymore. The crispy beef tacos are the best and make sure you get the spicy red salsa!</review>

<Text>Tacos are great! I love the little patio in the back. They offer beyond meat- the vegetarian alternative to ground beef. And their vegetarian burrito is one of the best I've ever had.  Perfectly saucy, copious veggies great beans, and lots of avocado.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I stopped by on a recommendation for some post-climbing-session food and was not disappointed. I had the surf-n-turf burrito and it was pretty killer. Also, the service was insanely fast. I'm not sure I was seated more than 2 minutes before my food was on the table. Going back here for sure.< /Review>< Name>

Surf and turf burrito was okay. Burrito in general was a bit on the slim side, especially for $13. Could've been a little more flavorful.</review>

<Text>Or at least it feels like it does. It's chicken soup with grilled chicken, tortilla strips, a little bit of heat and a lot of lime, and even with a cold you can taste it, and feel it working. My friend got the Danger Dog, a bacon-wrapped hot dog in a flour tortilla with all the fixings and she was loving it. The brownie was moist and big enough to split (full disclosure -- I couldn't taste it because of my cold, but my friend said it was delish). Ordering at the counter is quick and the food comes out fast and delicious, so don't mind the line, you'll get to where you're going in time. It's one of the cheaper alternatives before a concert at the Fox or the Paramount. There's table seating on the main floor, upstairs, and a small patio outside in the back. A large-screen tv downstairs shows mostly local sports or soccer.</Text><rating>5<//rating><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808f80b274a0f49b:0x1e1821f195ca9615< /gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics><UserId.>115871739747206739631< /UserId.><Time>1586588485492< /Time><username>Ethan Byrom</username></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Xolo is one of those larger holes in the wall that you could walk past and not think twice about it. You'd regret doing that though once your friend tells you how solid it is. There's nothing like finishing up a concert at the Fox, or seeing a show at the Paramount and finishing up the evening with a burrito, Corona , and guac from Xolo. If you're taking a date here there is this adorable little space in the back that is outside and overflowing with plants. You could miss it if you didn't know about it - but it's the type of experience that would leave your date thinking, wow, this person has good taste and is practical.< /Review>< Pictures>

The tacos are a tasty spin on authentic Mexican food. It's a, take a number and find your own seat, kind of place, and it is usually very busy so keep that in mind. I usually take my food to go. Love this place!< /review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>Decent tacos. Friendly, clean and open room. Clean bathrooms and friendly staff.

My main complaint is that a lot of time the meat in the tacos is dry and tastes like it has sat in the warmer way too long.

Still, I come here a fair bit and don't mind it at all.< /text>< user_name>

<Review>We were here to see a show at the Fox Theater across the street.  This location was perfect for both our timetable and our budget.

It was a hot day and either the air conditioning is non existent or wasn't keeping up.  It was hot in the restaurant.  The ambiance was great.  It's eclectic and funky.  The layout of the restaurant makes me wonder if they just kept expanding in to adjacent businesses as they grew.

The food was good.  The only knock I would give is that it took a while for us to get our food.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

OVERPRICED tacos in a beautiful, upbeat space. Horchata was good. Had shrimp tacos, not really worth it. Chicken tacos was far better! A good one time spot. I rather support the taco truck down the street. GOOD first date place, if youre bougie.<//text>

<review>Ordered the steak burrito. *sighs* well..... I ordered what was supposed to be a steak burrito got home only to be completely Disappointed!

1. My 3 year old son foot is  bigger (length & width )than my burrito

2..my  Burrito look like it was dipped in grease after being wrapped. I can fry chicken in my stomach with all the grease that I’d bitten out of my burrito.

3. Can anyone help me find the meat that was supposed to be in my burrito ? My ✌🏽Steak✌🏽
(<— air quotes) was 98% beans!! Every bite
( the 4 that I had taken) made me gag because there was sooooo much beans. After the third scoop they should’ve put the spoon down.

4. I had enough white( not red 😒) onions in my ✌🏽Steak✌🏽 Burrito I could sell them to the while foods down the street.

5. THEY CHARGED FOR SALSA... FOR SALSA!!! ( yes I am screaming)

They do use quality ingredients....I can’t say that. However, if you’re lucky enough to actually get a decent size burrito without the mountain and 5 gallons of beans  and maybe some meat then your food will be good.

This is totally a hipster spot! I am born and raised in Oakland I know good Mexican food when I get it .

I will continue to support the Taqueria’s that are in the hood and surrounding area, there’s one on first Street a Taco Truck that’s really good I would definitely stay going on there!

Oh yeah! Before I forget their burritos are way overpriced to get what I got $10 for a burrito<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Great space and pretty good food. I come here every once in a while to get my fix for tasty, heavy Mexican food and mega crispy chips. The space is themed in a modern take on Mexico, with bright colors, metal surfaces and nice illustrative elements. The burritos are very filling but don’t quite knock it out of the park for me.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>The surf and turf burrito was a fail, unless 1 piece of shrimp constitutes as “surf”. Minus the lack of surf, it was meh. Mostly beans. The ambiance is very, very casual... like inner city high school cafeteria that hasn’t been cleaned for a minute, type of casual. The staff is nice enough. The best thing in the joint is the huge TV always on soccer. Honestly, we should’ve gone to Chipotle.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I walked in without knowing anything about Xolo. Had the Chile verde burrito. The best burrito I’ve ever had! No rice. Just cheesy, porky, spicy goodness. Cordial, efficient service.

Don’t miss the little garden in the back.<//text>

Incredible food choices. This place bucks the trend for Mexican restaurants. Innovative options such as the Impossible tacos and chile rolleno burritos make this place a must go. It also helps that it's open later in the evening when such fares become exponentially more desirable.< /Review>

Great Al Pastor tacos.  The shrimp tacos were just okay and very tiny, so probably skip those if you're hungry.  Nice place to stop for a quick bite before going to a show at The Fox.  I'll have to return to try their burritos.</text>

<Review>After I moved away, this was the restaurant I missed most in Oakland, and when I came back to visit, I couldn't skip it.  Still holds up, these burritos are muy muy delicioso! Festive and colorful inside, but if you want to be real cool, check out the hidden patio in back.< /Review>< Response>

<Text>Food is good, if you ever get it. Restaurant sent me the wrong food on delivery then apparently decided to stop taking delivery orders meaning they were some how off the hook for correcting their errors. So I got stuck with some one else's order and no help. Lousy way to treat a customer.<//Text>< pics>

Vegetarians amd meat eaters must must come here. I hate telling people about this place because it would get to popular, but seems the word is getting out.  We order the impossible tacos which are vegetarian but taste damn good and as authentic as you will get.  They also have awesome rice and refried beans are amazing. A must eat.< /Review>

<Text>Went with my wife. Enjoyed some very nice Horchata while devouring 3 tacos each. They were a tad greasy because this place loves melted cheese. They are also small, as others have mentioned. However, they are much wider than most, and I still found myself full.

Their cabbage + lime + cilantro topping is superb, and a dash of their table-top hot sauce topped it off.

Overall, it was very nice. The atmosphere was nice and quiet on a Saturday night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It felt very clean as well.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Xolo is really stepping up their vegan options. First they had Impossible Burger meat, now they use Beyond Meat for tacos, burritos and more.  Also I think their pozole is vegan. Another excellent vegan option is the Hongos or mushroom filling which they will put in a taco or burrito and maybe some other things. All of their vegan options are tasty. So, although most of the menu consists of cruelly extracted meat items (individuals that want to live as badly as we do), Xolo does a great job of moving in the right direction!< /text>

Food is average.  Not great not terrible.  Location is close to the fox in Oakland so they do got the location thing going on though.  Plenty of seating which is another plus.< /Text>

Way overpriced!

<Review>Xolo is an okay place for a quick bite near the Fox before or after a concert. Their food is a bit pricey but decent. I like the Vampiro tacos and steak/shrimp burrito. These aren't Mission Burritos, so don't expect a lot. The Alfred Hitchcock poster is cool though.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< rate>

Small restaurant, I almost could not get into the my booth seat because the tables were so close together.

Do get the mussels, which are called Le mules (I was so confused at first as I do not eat at French restaurants often). I got the provencale Le mules, which is apparently the French version. I also wanted to try to Thai marinated version. The mussels came in a pot, they were very well marinated, make sure to soak some in the soup before eating it. The mussels are naturally small so you can't really get full on them, that's why the menu suggests you get a side of fries.</Review>

<Text>It's a nice place. Very nice host. Clean too! But hard to find parking at night. Biggest turn off is I paid $10 for what I was told was a super burrito, it turned out to be the size of the grilled stuffed burrito at taco bell down the street that I was too impatient to wait in the long line for. Now the food was ok-good not worth $10 for that small of a burrito.

The Big Ranch burrito is fantastic. If you are feeling tacos, the camarones taco has a killer sauce on it, and fried shrimp is pretty great too of course. A little pricy but not outrageous for the area.</review>

Bland & Bourgsie. Overpriced and watered down for the untrained palete. First and last visit, fortunately my boss paid. Should have known by the menu only generically listing beef, pork and chicken. If you walk into a "Taqueria" and they list the meats on the menu that way, turn around and walk out.<//review>

Great burritos. Came here on a whim and was surprised with delicious guacamole and the best chips I've had in California. Delicious green burrito and awesome hongos tacos with mushrooms and avocado!</Review>

Great tacos and burritos for vegetarians and meat eaters. Tacos are under four bucks and loaded, so if you need something small and cheap for lunch or before a show nearby, it is a great spot to stop.</text>

<user>102025853531471968865< /user><Text>I got the NOPALES burrito and it was AMAZING! it had a spicy pumpkin seed based sauce and eggs and potatoes and delicious black refried beans and so much deliciousness. I thought it had chorizo but I was wrong and frankly, I didn't miss it at all. Would definitely order it again and recommend everyone try it at least once because it clearly has some very Mexican flavors that you don't usually get at burrito places.

Edit: I went back! It was in the afternoon so they didn't have the burrito anymore as it's only for breakfast. I'm hooked on the nopales so I got a tostada with them and also their "Lima soup" which is a super deliciously tangy limey chicken tortilla strip soup. The chicken in the soup was a little overcooked but the broth was so good I didn't mind, that broth is the broth of my dreams. The other thing could be fixed is that the chips were cold but OMG their guacamole was perfection! Highly recommend for their vegetarian/vegan options and for people who want to try some authentic Mexican cactus YUM<//Text>< rating>

Xolo is my go-to place when I head to a show at the Fox. It's across the street, has delish food, is relatively inexpensive, and they are fast! My fave order consists of the Vampiro and Machaca tacos. The Vapiro taco is a cheesy corn tortilla filled with perfectly seasoned al pastor crisped to perfection. The Machaca taco is also a corn tortilla but it is stuffed with tender, juicy, slow cooked beef that is shredded and accompanied by soft, sweet bell peppers and onions. Definitely try this place out of you're into Mexican food.</Text>

The soup is okay, warm and you get it almost as fast as you order it. But there were no bread or anything on the side and the high roof and concrete walls makes the sound very easy to get loud and feel like a cafeteria.< /Review>

Always delish!! Mushroom taco, beef taco and veggie taco are some of my faves. The salad is amazing, although they are inconsistent with amount of toppings. I give a 4 for that and also they've given my vegetarian husband meet accidentally a few times.</text>

<text>I didn't take pictures of my burrito because I really didn't want it and wanted to leave but my vegan friend who wanted a burrito so bad was paying& was very hungry. Due to the fact that she is vegan she ordered what was rudely told to her as a "special" burrito ( She deconstructed their ingredients in a veggie burrito by just adding the certain ingrrdients she wanted) by requesting no cheese& certain veggies. That's when a second employee interjected and sternly said "we don't do that!!" He looked annoyed by her request. My friend said but I don't eat meat or cheese and that's why I want specific items on my burrito. On the nenu it does state " ask for vegan options". Howvever, he got a little louder and said But I'm trying to help you so whatever& he walked away. The young man taking her order in the meantime was rolling his eyes in his head. We were not allowed to take a paper menu, seat ourselves to decide what we wanted when we walked in. We were allowed to sit on benches at the entrance to decide, place order and pay before we were allowed to seat ourselves to eat. The burritos are pricey to me compared to the size you receive but they are tasty. The chips are too thick but the red salsa and guacamole is fresh and delicious. Metered parking is near by and hard to find a spot. They have no parking available for customers. Sorry to say, I won't be returning there when I'm in Oakland and wanting a burrito.cyst<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808f80b274a0f49b:0x1e1821f195ca9615< /Gmap_id></record>

Fast service, delicious tacos, casual place to have a good meal and chill. Nothing fancy...which is how it should be.</text>

Pretty small burritos for $10. Super lardy. Guess that's why it's comfort food? Probably should have gone with the tacos that everyone raves about.<//Review>

<review>I'm going to come out the gate and say the food here is over priced. $16 for aa small burrito and aa bottled beer is crazy by any standard. For what I paid the burrito should have been 2x the size it was. Also the beer didn't taste fresh, I wonder if they know that bottled beer has a 24 day self life. Anyway I won't eat here again.</review><Gmap_id>0x808f80b274a0f49b:0x1e1821f195ca9615<//Gmap_id>< user>

Service wise Xolo was excellent and very welcoming. The video e of the restaurant was very chill around the mid range noise level wise. It's a good date night spot for sure. Xolo however fell short on the grub. The burrito was lacking some true pastor flavor. I ordered the big ranch burrito with chips and salsa. The chips were not fresh and a little on the hard to bite into side. Pick de gallo was straight up tomato onion and cilantro no flare. It could've used some salt, lime juice, and serrano or jalapeño. The salsa verde made me want to go into the kitchen and add more to it. It also lacked seasoning and heat. I'll come back but I won't be ordering or recommending the Big Ranch.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><rating>3< /rating></record>

Only 1 star because I can't go any lower..  Asked for a steak burrito but what I got was far from it. Every ingredient placed in it was more like chow mein. Half of the burrito was onions,  barely had any meat. It was practically a chow mein wrap. Couldn't even eat a quarter of it..  Worse place I've ever gone to 0/10 I would never recommend it<//Review>

The quality of the burritos are great but there is something about this place that makes it feel a lot less authentic then it could. There aren't a ton of great Mexican food spots around here so Xolo is a good find however everything is way overpriced. They don't serve chips to your table and they want you to pay extra for any salsa for the burritos as well.< /review>

<text>This place sucks. Burritos are $10 and up! Theyre filled with mostly beans and barely any meat! Not to mention they charge for salsa! Its not even authentic. Its some white guy's idea of what mexican food taste like.. taco bell is more authentic and better than this failure of a mexican restaurant<//text>< Rating>

Food is good but VERY overpriced: $7 for chips and maybe 2 oz. of guacamole, $4 for street tacos (need at least 3 to make a decent meal). Also, the chips are way too crunchy.< /review>

Tacos are delicious. I'm a fan of the beef and chile verde ones.The burritos are not the best. The surf-n-turf one sounds good, but it doesn't have much meat or shrimp. It is mostly beans. It advertises pinto beans, but they are actually refried. Really good guacamole and chips. It is counter service and they bring the food out to your table.<//text>

<text>This is our go-to taqueria.  Great burritos, tacos, and a hearty giant salad which we'll get and add chicken or camarones to.

Aguas frescas are always available, and the recently-added fried plantains dessert item is delicious.</text><Gmap_id>0x808f80b274a0f49b:0x1e1821f195ca9615< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

Tried their machaca burrito, and while it's good, it's quite messy because of the sauce that's inside. The cantaloupe agua fresca was refreshing. Their food does cost more than the average taqueria, and I'm not quite sure that it's worth the value, to be honest.< /review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The taste is good, but the attention is very bad
especially on the part of the lady who is taking the orders, is always bad and apparently they give them the onion because it is more onion than food .....

El sabor esta bueno, pero la atencion es pesima
sobre todo por parte de la senorita que esta tomando las ordenes, siempre esta de malas y al parecer les regalan la cebolla por que es mas cebolla que comida.....< /Review>< rate>
