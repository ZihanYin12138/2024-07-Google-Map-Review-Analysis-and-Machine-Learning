<Review>Great customer service but got a bit duped. I was working with one of the salesman for my over a month. I had to wait for my taxes to come in so I could pay the down payment. I had picked a car but unfortunately it got sold before I had the money. So, I found another one, even a few grand cheaper. Since I’m rebuilding my credit, this seems like maybe a better choice because of price. So, I finally got paid and take several different forms of transportation to get there(  I live in San Diego). Once the deal starts they inform me that because of the financing they have to use for me ( I have bad credit) there are all of these extra charges this particular finance company requires, it made my nice $6,000 vehicle go up to almost $9,000. On top of that the finance charge is 28%. I knew that the APR would be that high but I didn’t expect them to include almost $4,000. So now my vehicle is going to cost me almost $20 grand when it’s paid off in 4 years!!! I almost left and forgot about doing the deal but I needed a car so bad!! So, they were very nice and helpful but I definitely got taken to the cleaners!! Just be aware when buying from them....</Review><date>1624940778332< /date><UserId.>103330452127933125277</UserId.><gmapID>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac< /gmapID>< name>

This is the best dealership i have ever been too!! If i could rate more than 5 stars I would. David and Erik were super super helpful and patient. They are very understanding and will do the very best they can to help you get the vehicle you love. David, I got to say thank you very much for your patience, kindness, and positive energy. Erik thank you for kindness, help, and patience. I highly recommend this place they are  honest and helpful. They don’t rush you like other dealerships, i felt welcomed. All the staff are nice and welcoming I am super happy with the vehicle I purchased from them  and the pricing is perfect.</Text>

<date>1599000373331< /date><rate>1</rate><Review>This company is fraud !!! I bought a vehicle with a pre authorization from Capital One (who i have also filed a complaint with on your company and requested that Kar Genie be removed from their list of providers) I bought a vehicle in July received my plates 2 wks later . They expire in 2 mths really? I paid the fees for a year but because stg auto didnt register the vehicle for the time they had it the registration will expire in 2 mths. I called to speak to the manager he was arrogant and tried to street slick talk me. I'm from the south side of Chicago there will be NO slicking me. And said No he would not be helping me. So as I go to all streams of social media to let you all know of my experience.BEWARE oh i almost forgot i had to buy 2 tires already not a month since i bought the vehicle. For full encounter check out podcast #myblackdollarcounts   This company is soo funny he called as if i would change my review. All I can say is that for him to post all that, why send me a check later for 117.00?< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr-UQtVx4375mDYOdimx32l4KuTuHQWh-x2pCK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1596648588201, 'text': "Qiana, we discussed this over the phone already. I gave you a very crystal clear explanation as to why your tags were due so soon. I hope you can try to understand that EVERY DEALERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA operates this way and we are no different. License and registration is the responsibility of the BUYER NOT THE SELLER. That's why EVERY vehicle advertised states the price PLUS tax, title, license, registration, etc... The only difference is that if the tags on the car you are purchasing are still valid for 90 days (which yours were still valid), its not added into the financing. Either way, you would still be the one to pay for it, whether it was added to your financing or it was paid out of pocket 90+ days later, YOU have to pay for it, NOT the dealer. This is NOT FRAUD, this is DMV regulation. I'm not quite sure how else to explain this to you, Qiana. I'm sorry you are upset about this but I hope you can do a little more research to see that what I'm saying is true. I hope this doesn't stop you from shopping with us in the future. Have a blessed day."}<//Response>< GmapID>

< Review>
My expectations were low going in to this dealership because I had such a horrible experience with the last dealership I went to (KarPlus Warehouse). Not only was I met with hospitality, refreshments , and just an overall warm and inviting atmosphere at the dealership, I had an amazing experience with my salesman Cesar. He was very funny and very prompt. Not only that, he was extremely friendly and welcoming to the point that while I was talking to him, I forgot I was in the midst of buying a car- which is usually a draining and uninteresting process.

I was very upfront with Cesar - I didn’t want a cosigner, I didn’t want a high monthly payment, I had great credit but lack of history since I’m only 18 but still wanted everything in my name and only the specific car I requested. Cesar wasn’t pushy and suggestive like most salesman are, he made sure I was MORE than satisfied! This was the only dealership that would work with me and my lack of history and i an so grateful to them for that.

I drove about an hour just to come to this dealer and I was extremely impressed. I would recommend this dealer to anyone looking to purchase a well maintained used car.

Also wanted to throw out a special mention to Art and Angel. I didn’t get to meet them in person, but the days leading up to my visit, they made sure to reach out to me about the car, reassure me on the process, and make my experience going in to the dealership very smooth. Thank you</Review>

I received great customer service and I had my loan approved by the most professional personnel. I am very happy about my purchase and I can say I received the best deal around

KarGenie is amazing! I asked for details on a car I loved online and they reached out fast.
When I went to them they greeted me big a smile and all staff was very nice.
Angel and Harry very humble and down to earth. They took their time to help me out and kept me smiling and laughing throughout my visit.
Hands down one of the best experience I’ve had in a dealership.
GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!<//Review>

<text>I never thought I could have had the car Eric and Caesar got for me. I had my eye set on a big truck for my mom's wheelchair, but I have absolutely no credit. 0. They called and said Earl, what do we have to do to get your business?
Try me, he said.
I walked out with not the truck originally wanted but a newer, nicer, less mileage and what I actually dreamt about having but never thought I could afford.
And I got it cheaper.
Maybe we are wrong about salesman...
I know I would have been wrong about them.
Come get yours'

<Text>We searches for cars on-line yesterday.  We found a few we wanted to look at. None were close to our home but we decided to come first to Kar Genie in Montclair.  When we arrived, our appointment was on-time. The car was exactly as advertised our sales person Allan Infante did not try to upsell us or get us interested in any other car. We negotiated. Far price. He was very easy to work with. Very highly recommend him.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Angel worked with us and made us feel comfortable and confident in our car buying experience. Very transparent and was able to get us a great deal on the vehicle and warranty. Felt like a winner leaving the dealership. Would definitely recommend working with him, thanks Angel! 👍🏽 👍🏽<//Review>

BEYOND EXCELLENCE!!!
Cesar introduced himself while I was sitting in my car not wanting to get out because I was discouraged about being denied for bad credit. He said don't worry we specialize in reestablishing your credit. Long story short I drive off with my dream car a 2016 Dodge Challenger
Cesar, Art and Mike are Monica's Angel's
Diligent, good service!< /Text>

<text>We had came to this place looking to come out with a car, unfortunately when we asked to speak to the general sales manager Mike Saseung about the pricing. As soon as he sat down he spoke to my husband and I with an attitude and turned us down before we had even started negotiations. When we had told him okay that’s fine we’ll look somewhere else he responded with “Okay fine get out then”. He then proceeded to tell us we were not customers and that we were trespassing and being very rude. The vehicle we saw online had no issues and seemed to be in perfect condition until we had actually seen it in person. Not only did it have exterior damage all around the car, but the turbo was covered with a piece of tape, not replaced. Oil was also leaking, when they had told us it was just replaced and maintenance. The other salesmen were polite and everything was fine up until we spoke to Mike. If you are looking for a vehicle, I would not recommend this place.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1614923715986, 'text': 'I\'m sorry you feel this way Stefany. However, I spoke to your husband on the phone prior to coming out. He asked me about the pricing. I told him that our vehicles are priced to sell, they DO NOT include taxes and fees, and they are firm. It\'s tax season. All of this info is stated on our website and this is also a recorded call that I\'ll gladly let you listen to if you\'d like. He shows up and demands a SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR DISCOUNT because this used 2015 with almost 60k miles wasn\'t in mint condition. He then proceeds to demand that every little scratch on the car be repaired and calls me rude when I tell him that it\'s completely unreasonable to expect me to discount the car AS WELL AS fix all the cosmetic issues . I show him all of the people scheduled to come look at this car and he responds with "Well we\'ll just go look somewhere else." I\'m sorry but your husband threw childish tantrum in my showroom floor, attempted talked to every customer in my building, some of which didn\'t care because they heard the entire conversation, so I asked you guys to leave as any business manager would. All of this on camera by the way. You asked for my business card, I gave it to you. You asked for the owners contact info, I gave it to you. I\'m sorry you had a bad experience, so did we. I wish you the best of luck in your search. Let me know if you change your mind about my this car, I\'ll gladly shake your hand and give you a do-over.'}<//Response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I rarely write reviews but I wanted to share my experience.  It was a fun and easy buying a car from Kar Genie.  I found a car I was interested in on Car Gurus.  I filled out the contact form on Car Gurus and had a response within an hour.  Joe Miranda helped us out and promptly answered a few questions I had.  We arrived about 30 minutes late for our scheduled appointment.  It wasn't a problem and Joe was ready and waiting for us.  He had our vehicle up front and  ready to go for our test drive.  Joe was very easy to deal with during the test drive and purchase process.  He answered all of my questions without hesitation. It was nice to have a dealership honestly answer questions about various fees associated with purchasing a vehicle.  Everyone at the dealership was very friendly and helpful.  They made us feel very comfortable while we were there.  Joe didn't use any high pressure sales tactics.  In all of my dealings with dealerships, this was one of the best experiences I've had.  Again, I'd like to thank Joe and everyone at the dealership for making this a great shopping experience.< /Review><Date>1603321660419<//Date><gmapID>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac</gmapID>< resp>

Such a wonderful experience. Angel the sales representative, what can I say but very professional, polite and enthusiastic. My wife and I purchased our 17 year old a 2011 Toyota Corolla today (his first car) I would definitely refer people to purchase a vehicle here at KAR GENIE and see Angel.</Review>

Great service, quick response, the sales team was very friendly and I would definitely come back. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because they don't have contactless card reader. With most of my cards being on my phone this is a must.
Big thanks to Cesar!!!!</review>

I didn’t have a good experience here, I actually decided not to go through with the sale for multiple reasons, but the main reasons were, I caught them lying and being dishonest, and whenever I had a valid objection, they would try to, fast talk me, pressure me, and intentionally try to confuse me. If you have to try and run game to make a sell, I’m out.

I may have “very very bad credit” but that didn’t stop the owner from desperately begging for me to go along with the sale 😉<//Review>

{'time': 1610242629481, 'text': 'This is hilarious. Chase, when will you realize that your numbers make no mathematical sense? I showed you a breakdown penny for penny, you didn\'t trust that the payment was accurate. You accuse me of inflating the payment with some shady back door tactic. OK, no problem. I tell you to download an auto loan calculator, there are hundreds of them in the app store and they all use the same mathematical formula. I even showed you the one I use. The numbers CAME OUT THE SAME. You still didn\'t believe it. OK, no problem. You Googled an auto loan calculator and used Google\'s auto loan calculator. The numbers CAME OUT THE SAME. You STILL didn\'t believe it. OK, no problem. I found an article online and text it to you. It was titled "How to calculate an auto loan payment in 3 easy steps". You followed the steps and the numbers, well, guess what? THEY CAME OUT THE SAME! lol. The payment is high because you have very very bad credit not because anyone was trying to lie to you. The problem is not with us being dishonest brother. There seems to be a bit of an intellectual problem with you my man. Hope you figure it out some day. If you\'d like to go over these numbers again, please come back and see us! We love to do simple math all day long. All in a days work! Until then, remember to look both ways before you cross the street, ok? Have a blessed night!'}</response>

<Review>I purchased a car here and the car needed a new battery, the engine was dusty, navigation/stereo needed to be programmed and the interior needed detailing. I was promised that the next day everything will be tooken care of. So next day i followed up and i was ignored. So i went over after work and nobody knew anything. So i returned it becaused they didnt keep their word and on top of that they ran my credit 6 TIMES!!!! now that is horrible caused my credit score to go down a little so becareful with this dealership. I recommend not to shop here.< /Review>< pics>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Stay away from these shady and dishonest people! I live 2 hours North and was interested in a 2012 Black Mazda3. Pictures online showed pictures taken in a showroom and the car had custom black rims, car looked amazing! I called Jacob the day before to make sure it was still available, he tells me “yes, but we do have other Mazda’s for sale” hmm🤔 I show up the next day right when they opened. Jacob was there and shows me the car, bait and switch!! The car was missing all four hubcaps, wait what? It has “Auction” written on the window. What happened to the custom rims?? The car at the dealership was not the same car advertised online! What an absolute waste of my time and how dishonest this dealership is!! Buyer beware!</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Angel was one of the best sales reps I've ever had while buying a car. He was attentive to my car buying needs and helped with all my questions. I will definitely buy my next car from Kargenie because of Angel. Thank you!

Update: My vehicle turned out to be a lemon and once I returned it there was nothing they can do to help me finance another one. Considering what I've gone through trying to purchase another vehicle I was sure they'd be more helpful but they werent.</text>< UserId.>

{'time': 1602732986995, 'text': 'Hello Noeh. I\'m sorry you had a bad experience. However, our salesman NEVER told you that your low offer was feasible. All calls are recorded and so are the text messages. We NEVER responded with "Let\'s make it happen" as you claim. I think you and I both know this. But look, it\'s ok. I\'m still willing to make you a deal but you cant make us an offer for THOUSANDS less than what they are currently selling for and get mad at us and call us liars when we don\'t say yes. The reason why I was trying to sit you down to "look over other cars" in the market was to show you what they are selling for, something I\'m sure you already know because you already did the research yourself. Look, its a Honda Civic. These cars are a dime a dozen. You don\'t have to drive 2 hours away for one but you still have to pay them dime. I was even telling you that I would give you the best deal you can find. Show me one for less and I\'ll still beat it! Pretty fair deal if you ask me. If you change your mind and want to make a reasonable offer, let me know. Still would like to earn your business.'}<//response>

Wow! So let me tell you this. This of course is an individual experience. I went to this car dealership initially talking over the phone with one of the representatives. I was told that I would receive a car for a certain price... I also have text messages to support that***. I told them if I could receive this car for a certain price in cash because the drive was 2 hours away!. They responded with let's make that happen.Upon arriving I was told to sit down and they were bargaining me a price higher than what I was told over the phone. The thought of (sketchy car salesman) was constantly going into my head. They disregarded the messages I sent prior and further said things like "do you even know how much this car sells from other markets!?" -manager. He even tried to make me sit down to look over other cars, I guess trying to prove his sentament. While walking away "clearly bothered" one of the salesmen said "you don't want it for a higher price?"..Do yourself a favor y'all, don't come to this facility if you want to buy a car from honest people. If anyone would like I can even offer the screenshots of my message list.<//Review>

I have to tip my hat to Harry/Harout for his assistance with buying our new (to us) car.  He was pleasant, provided great conversation, and had surprisingly good product knowledge for a used car that he didn't sell brand new. The car that was sold was given a perfect bill of health from our Mercedes specialist mechanic who mentioned that it is the cleanest used example he's ever seen. The process of buying was painless, and Harry was able to facilitate delivery to our home in Upland, where we signed all papers and conducted the final transaction. This is a smooth operation, just make sure you take your time to negotiate and arrive at the deal you want. Standard asking price has some room for negotiation - take your time to work a good deal, and you'll leave with a fantastic car. I give extra points for facilitating delivery at home (a big deal for my significant other due to COVID paranoia their part)... overall, I give them extra credit for their adaptability and willingness to go the extra mile to get a mutually beneficial deal made. Good job, guys!<//review>

At KarGenie not only did they help me find the vehicle I was looking for, but got a great deal compared to other known dealerships. Service was great and got in and out with a ease. Do yourself a favor, if your looking for a vehicle KarGenie is the place. Thanks KarGenie.<//text>< Pics>

Making the appointment was really easy and cool. Walked up and Allan was helpful from the jump. Took a test drive, was very friendly and transparent about the car, engine, possible issues. Offer was good, worked with my cash budget well, was fast and efficient. Would recommend EVERYONE to buy there first car here!!</text>

I want to personally thank Angel Moreno for helping me purchase and finance my first car! I came in after looking at CarFax, and I went to three other car dealerships today looking for a car. The people weren't as friendly and quite honestly made me feel like they were trying way to hard to get me to buy one of their cars, whereas Angel made me feel like he was helping me find the best car for me.

Big thanks to Angel, and his manager (I believe) who was named Sam for their care and effort put into helping me get back off my feet and back into a car. I would highly recommend them for their friendliness and financing flexibility, as well as the cleanliness of the site. Great experience!</Review>

<Date>1596132124553</Date><rating>1< /rating><Review>had bad experience with this company.  firstly, their cars are in poor condition and very dirty.  They will sell you a car without even a vacuum salon.  In place of this, they will say good words to you and smile, and they will laugh behind your back.  Secondly, they will try to sell you the protective systems you do not need at a cost of $ 1000 !!!  Read the description below, they don't even hide it.  I understand that the company wants a profit.  But in my opinion this is just the imposition of something you do not need for an additional fee.  It would be better if they put their cars in order.  And in the third and worst, even if they make an appointment for you, you can easily come, but you will not be warned and at the door they will say that the car is sold.  Of course, the main thing is to sell the car, the main thing is definitely not the service.  In general, be attentive, managers in white shirts will smile at you, offer water or coffee.  It's all just to create an elusion of the alleged service.  Instead, to any cost of the car, you will additionally add the price for their security system at a cost of almost 1k.  By the way, you can check it yourself, I have not seen this from other dealers.  I daresay if they are unable to vacuum from the dog hair, I doubt they even check anything.  In general, be careful.  I really do not recommend buying a car here.< /Review>< Pictures>

<user_name>Irane Diaz<//user_name><Review>THIS PLACE IS THE WORSE PLACE TO GO BUY A USED CAR!!!!! I had the worse experience I have ever had purchasing a car.  I was there for over 4 Hrs and when i finally said yes ill take the deal they then said there is one issue.."we have to keep the car and you will get it tomorrow" they said the car needed a smog. I said ok that was fine, the next day came and no one called me to give me an update. I had to call them and they would just text instead. I worked with Angel, Jacob and Pouya the sales Manager.  Kept getting the run around. I ended up getting a car a week later after I had to call every day to check the status. I got the run around every time!! They lie and are quick to take your $. When i finally picked up the car it did not have the stocked speakers that they said they would put back in, which we had agreed on! the car had no speakers! when I brought it up some other guy MIKE came out talking about oh i will have my friends at the stereo shop call you for a discount , never got the call. When i called to ask for him never got a call back! I had also given a hold deposit of $250.00 and have not received it back they said the accounting department was working on the refund. I would not recommend this place to anyone! its all lies .so unprofessional<//Review>< Rating>

Stay away! They use bait and switch tactics, they try to lure  you with supposedly low interest rates by asking you to fill a form and without your permission they do a hard inquiry on your credit report. I clearly stated and I would not go ahead with filling that form if there would be a hard pull on my credit report and I was promised that it would not be a hard pull. These crooks did a hard inquiry without my permission. I have asked for the manager and they didn't get back< /text>

They have an excellent selection of cars. Allan was amazing. He helped my wife & I with all our questions & concerns that we ended up purchasing a truck. He was very patient & explained everything thoroughly. Thank you Allan for all your help. If in the future we decide to buy another vehicle we would request Allan for his excellent customer service. I would recommend this place to anyone.<//text>

< Review>
Just a warning for any unsuspecting used car buyers these guys are SHADY..

They listed a vehicle at $17500. I asked for a quote knkwing there would be sales tax and some fees and it comes to over $21000. Now you're gonna pay sales tax and some dmv fees, maybe even a couple hundred for documentation, but That's OVER $2000 in dealer fees.

I pointed out the fact that $2000 in dealer fees is not gonna fly.

The salesmen then listed: $395 for window tint, $395 for LoJack and $295 for door guards. Stereotypical used car salesmen. See the attached screenshot.

This vehicle was tinted by the manufacturer. What used car dealer installs Lojack and what even are door guards???

Just advertise the actual price guys.</Review>

<Text>Sales rep was great! Their service department is no good, which why I gave them 2 stars. watch out for the extra things they charge tint is not worth paying for it. They redid the tint and still had air bubbles not worth 500$ they also charge for door protectors not needed. They broke my rear window defroster was not broken before. I purchased my vehicle a month ago waited to see if they would redo my tint since they charged so much to post my review. called dealer they told me to call their service  department they dont handle  service  issues at front desk.< /Text>< pics>

I'm a difficult car buyer and want the world.  These guys took it in stride and treated me well from the beginning.  I had a great experience, the car was cleaner than expected and the experience was positive.  I will make a return trip for my next used car from this dealer.  Low pressure sales, no BS games, used their financing with very competitive rates, just solid and got exactly what they advertised.<//Text>

<Text>Had a great experience at Kar Genie today!!! Was able to finance my Audi with no credit and a first time buyer thanks to the help of Christopher Rodriguez. He really understands you as a buyer is very honest. He treats people with respect and is an honest man.< /Text>< pics>

<text>(UPDATE : August 7, 2020)

Was driving city at low speeds & “Check Hybrid System” popped up on dash.. After further investigating I got a P0A80 code & it’s a bad battery. And further proves my point of their inventory not being properly inspected or serviced... I cannot believe this AT ALL CAR ONLY HAS 82,000 and purchased in February this year. I’m so disappointed & will now have to spend over $2000 to replace the hybrid battery. Worst car purchase experience I’ve ever had!!!

Salesmen say anything to sell you a car!

Allan mentioned that they changed everything that has 70% or less in wear and tear items (Brakes, tires, suspension etc) After inspecting the car brake padslooked like sand paper rotors were warped, tires were cracked, all wiper blades were trash, cabin & air filter were filled with dirt which lead the car to smell like mold & spark plugs were fouled. Also I purchased this car in February 2020. Allan said they would honor the first year registration fee , since they expire in June 2020. Now they are saying that they only honor it when they are 2 months from expiring. So just please don’t take their word for it, do your own due diligence!< /text><user_id>110630196842898782916<//user_id><gmapID>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac<//gmapID>< Date>

After everything that has occurred, the dealership was willing to work with me and sort out the issues and get me into a safe vehicle with pretty fair terms.

Thank you, Mike, for helping me sort through the problems and for ensuring I was a happy customer.

Giving four stars instead of the one for upholding to integrity and customer service.

Structural Damage!!!!

UPDATE: 8/2/2020
I found out that my insurance company is not willing to cover vehicles with damage like mine after being notified by them after we spoke "rhetorically". With my insurance not being willing to cover a vehicle like this, the bank loan is probably going to be affected, and I'm just in a whole mess.
The authorized dealer that did my inspection reported the damage which will probably end up changing the title of the car which is a whole other mess.
I told my lawyer that id be willing to try and work things out with the dealer if they are willing to work things out with me. The problem at this point is that I've been put in an impossible situation. I've lost countless hours, thousands of dollars, time at work, time at school, and have been beyond stressed trying to sort this mess out.

So. After speaking to the dealer, they offered me to switch vehicles. Okay. Fine and dandy. But I wanted reimbursement for the work I put into the messed up vehicle they gave me. I'd only had the vehicle for 3 weeks and literally one day after I drove it off the lot had to get new tires (they had different tire sizes on it), and had to get the oil change. They said, "we don't know. We have to work the numbers."

So I'm here trying to work things out with them despite my lawyer telling me to fight, and obviously they're still trying to make the most money they can out of me despite all of the losses I've had. I will update my review after the situation is either unwinded or not.

Previous Review:
Highly do not recommend this place.

I've had my vehicle for two weeks and took it into an authorized dealership to get an oil change (because they lied and told me they did the oil change and they didnt.)

The technician and manager of the place I took my car to brought me into the back and told me that they had serious concerns. The car has severe structural damage underneath and it has to be fixed for my safety. They said that the person that tried to fix it welded the parts incorrectly to make a "quick fix it" type thing and that essentially it was all done very wrong and that the damage was severe and was a safety concern.

At Kargenie, when I purchased the vehicle, there was no point in time that they stated to me that the car had structural damage. I ASKED them straight forward and they said that the carfax is clean and reports are clean and that the car has no issues. Trust me, I would NEVER pay as much money as I did for a car with structural damage if they would have actually told me. No one in their right mind would have done that.

Think about this for a moment: if the owner of this dealership is okay with me driving a car that I paid over $20k for off the lot, knowing very well that it could be an issue to my safety, and didn't care about that. Imagine what else they would do to sell to you.

I would recommend that you do not purchase a vehicle here. It is unfortunate, sad, but the truth. Your safety and well being is a lot more important.<//Text>< pics>

<date>1592539579177< /date><review>Wouldn’t recommend going to Kar Genie unless you want them to waste your time. Talked to a salesman named Angel and scheduled an appointment to look at a car I was most definitely going to buy , and after driving over 160 miles to see it he was on his day off. I ended up talking to another salesman named Santiago and he was ok at first until it came down to talking numbers. After test driving the car, He was supposed to call me to negotiate after my family and I had lunch after and never called. I ended up calling him to see about negotiating and he said he would get back to me and never did. Total waste of time. Definitely do not recommend< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Buyers Beware - Bait and Switch
Spoke to Angel on the phone and he confirmed vehicle was available. I confirmed there was not going to be further fees as they have in small print below all vehicles that -
"All advertised prices exclude $495 Theft Patrol antitheft device, $395 3Mﾮ Door Guard, any Aftermarket Wheels, Lift Kits, Lowering Kits, Tint, Accessories, government fees and taxes, any finance charges, any dealer document preparation charge, and any emission testing charge."

Angel confirmed that this vehicle does not have these fees and that statement is only for a select few vehicles. I drove an hour to check out the vehicle. I Liked what I saw, test drove it, and we both went into the "dreaded office" where the games begin.

Going back to before the test drive, Angel made sure to let me know that their biggest problem as a dealership is selling the car before the customer can test drive or purchase (LOL -  this is the set up for the bait & switch. Don't let them fool you into thinking they sell 12 cars a day).
So now we're in the office talking numbers and he brings his offer to the "boss." Angel then comes back in the room and asked me to switch rooms because the cleaning lady has to clean his office (LOL, really????). So now I'm in a different office and Mike the sales manager comes in and says "So the vehicle you want to purchase was just sold - someone in the next room just put a full offer on it." Now I'm just laughing inside because it is all very clear what is happening at this point. Mike goes on to mention he wants to sell me a car. He might have a "similar" vehicle on his lot but he needs to check (because the lot is so big he has no idea what he has for inventory (sarcasm) LOL). He checks and wow he has a similar vehicle he can sell me right now. A MIRACLE.... Really?

Long story short these guys are complete scammers. They will be reported to BBB and any other site I can find to help other potential customers avoid their pitiful attempts to cheat and scam people.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Resp>{'time': 1596038925872, 'text': 'I\'m sorry you feel this way Mike. You were given a fair opportunity to purchase the vehicle just like the other customer that showed up a few minutes after you. You were advised that another customer was here to look at that same car and you even watched as they drove off for a test drive. While you were busy asking for a RIDICULOUS discount on a $6000 car, the other customer simply told us he wanted the vehicle and paid the asking price in cash.  You even walked by the office where they were sitting as they were counting the cash. Despite the fact that this car was priced AGRESSIVELY cheap, it seems your greed got the best of you. The fact that you call this a bait and switch is rather laughable, Mike. Come on lol. We both know what really happened. Two young men made a gentleman\'s deal on a great car and Im happy for them.\n\nBy the way, thank you for highlighting my disclosure about our added accessories. You\'re right it\'s listed right below the car features and its the very first sentence you see. I gotta say, it\'s rather odd that you call that a scam when its listed RIGHT THERE and its the very first sentence you see. Lol. Isnt a scam something that I would try to sneak in unethically to steal money from people? I don\'t know, maybe we have different definitions. Also, we offer a 2 day no-questions-asked return policy in case you simply just change your mind. That doesnt seem very "scammy" to me, Mike.\n\nLook, we get in A LOT of inventory on a regular basis. Mustangs like the one you wanted come in all the time. Tell you what, when I get another one, I\'ll reach out to you and lets make gentleman\'s deal ok Mike? I still wanna earn your business but most of all your trust. I\'m not a big big dealership. I run an honest business and my success depends entirely upon building healthy relationships. Just read all of my great reviews, they\'ll tell you. Especially during these troubling times, leaving a bad review for a business simply because you didn\'t get your way just really isnt cool man. You even went to the BBB, lol! But hey, to each their own. I still want to earn your business. Hope to talk to you soon, Mike. Til then, stay safe, stay healthy, and God bless!'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>Manny unfortunately didn't really seem very knowledgeable about the car or the services offered by this dealership. Though he does seem to be a nice guy, it felt like I needed to keep checking things to make sure I wasn't getting screwed.

They didn't tell me about the structural damage to the car until the very end, though I had asked about damages. (Use CarFax, it's really worth it. Don't make the mistake of trusting any dealer like I did.)

The car was dirty and had duct tape residue on the outside of the car. Manny assured me that it would all be cleaned. The vehicle was taken out of my sight for a little over an hour... but then nothing was cleaned. What were they doing with the car? I have no idea.

They also are pushing Portfolio Protection really hard. It's not really clear what is covered by this "warranty" as the actual documentation on what is NOT covered appears to be... most things..? It's a couple thousand dollars to purchase.

I was able to get them to knock off the almost $500 charge on tinting the windows of the car by pointing out that they didn't include any means to charge the plugin hybrid I was purchasing. (Charge kit or anything like that.)

To end it all, both Eli and Manny cornered me in the sales office asking me to give a good rating on Google. They said that they didn't like asking me to do this, but the implication was that I wouldn't be able to leave until I did so. To be clear, they didn't say I HAD to do it, they were just blocking the door to the office and not letting me change topics that I wanted to wait until the transaction was complete. I gave them a 5 star rating, but that wasn't enough. Eli came back to tell me it needed text. Keep that in mind when you're checking the reviews here that are 5 stars. It's always irritated the hell out of me when people beg for reviews before the completion of the purchase, I've knocked off a star for that.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>I’m mad that you actually have to at least give them one star. Just bought a car with kargenie within a week of having the car the check engine light came on.  I went to the dealership they said that they would have somebody from service call me and that didn’t happen. Then I’ve been calling them almost everyday since then. I took the car to ford for a diagnosis and they told me that my cylinders were flooded with coolant , that there was no way it would’ve passed a smog test and that I need to take the car back to wherever I got it. Everybody keeps giving me the run around And all I want is my money back. At this point I wouldn’t even want another car from them. Bought  the car June 5, 2020 and am still waiting til this day for a response or something from this dealership. How is it ok to sell messed up cars and then ghost your customer.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80c3337f7a9c716b:0x4ebf48c054505ac< /Gmap_id>< rate>

<response>None</response><rating>1<//rating><Review>After visiting several dealerships and being told I couldn't get financing for a BMW, Jessie at Kar Genie made me a very happy girl! I'm driving home in my 2011 BMW 328i Coupe. Thank you Jessie!👍

*Update* Still love my car but hate the dealership. I am embarrassed to say, I have been seriously ripped off by the "optional products" that were added on to my sales contract. I accept responsibility for not reading everything that was put in front of me to sign by the salesman, but $3,000 worth of useless products that weren't installed or activated isn't just shady...it's disgusting.  Also, after I complained to the salesman, he told me to bring the car back, other people were interested in buying it. I would have to pay them a contract cancelation fee of several hundred dollars though. A few days later, I received a text message from my salesman telling me to bring the car back or they would have it repossessed. At that point, the loan had already been funded. They had their money and no reason to threaten repossession. BTW, I emailed the owner, Tony Bacily twice about my purchase, I never received a response from him.</Review>< Name>

Ray was so helpful and answered all my questions in a way I could understand. if you are in the market for a car I highly recommend  coming to this location. I got the car I  have been looking at with no added stress!!!!!!!!!  THANK YOU RAY!!!!!</review>

<Review>Came to kargenie expecting to get turned down since my credit is not all that great , but working with Allan he made it happen I'm driving off the lot with the SUV of my choice! So if your looking for a your next car come to KarGenie and ask for Allan he will work with you and make it happen! Thank you Allen</Review>< pictures>

Cheap gas? This is the place. But it's only accessible by military personnel, veterans, dependents and government employees. Please comment if I miss anything.

TIP!! Use your star card, you get back $.5 per gallon. You'll also get reward points!! It's a win win deal!!!

BUT NO PROBLEM!!! If you can't access this place. There's another one off base.</review>

<review>Just want to say something. Bought my tire here last May. Got a flat tire and went here. Asked the dude with the beard (29AuG2020) if they can fix the tire he said yes. As soon as I asked if it's free because I got the warranty for it, he quickly told me they were so busy it will take atleast 6 hours before it gets seen and discount tire will fix it for free. Need my tire to be fixed so Im here at discount tire right now and paid 13 dollars to get it fixed and Im pretty sure it will void my warranty now. Thanks bearded guy. Love the autoport dont get me wrong, I just felt that he didnt want to give a free service because of warranty.</review><Gmap_id>0x80d9530f34855acd:0xc2cf540fdc76de34</Gmap_id><name>Ian De Leon<//name><userid>104521837866151202608< /userid>< Resp>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>This location only wants super easy jobs or the quick normal maintenance.  Twice I have brought my truck in for maintenance that was beyond my own capabilities and received nothing but excuses.  The first time they said my transmission was going out and it was just a brake locking due to a bad hose for fluid.  This second time I asked for exhaust manifolds to be changed since I tried changing one and needed bolts tapped out.  They gave me a bigger excuse that they couldn't fit it on the rack overnight and it needed welded.  The original time I tried to replace myself took me less than 4 hrs to access.  Everyone is already charging 6hr minimum for this job, which would have only taken a few moment's longer due to tapping the screws out.  Find a mechanic that wants to actually work and be challenged.  At this point the third time is not a charm, I will not return with more difficult work.  I am finding the mobile mechanic who hungers for the job.</review><GmapID>0x80d9530f34855acd:0xc2cf540fdc76de34< /GmapID><UserId.>111009443573151032726</UserId.>< time>

We were looking for a good Mongolian restaurant and found it here! 5 stars: All you can eat, quality, taste and price, portion.<//text>

<Text>My family and I stop by for Mongolian BBQ everytime we are in Moreno Valley.  I have always had a great experience.  Last week, I was really disappointed.  The fried food tasted like it was cooked in old grease.  The shrimp fried rice was dry and the shrimp didn't taste good.  The soup had a strong seafood taste.  I had to throw most of the food away.  My family would not eat it.</Text></record>

I went with my wife to eat yesterday for the 5th time and we got our food and took it to the chef to cook, everytime we had went it was an all you can eat buffet as it is advertised on the restaurants window, but this time the lady wanted to charge us for every plate we would get saying that though its a buffet we could only get food one time and that we would be charged for every plate we got after the first time, she also didnt know how to explain why she was trying to charge us for every plate we got so we ended up leaving, we had been coming here for years and they have lost a customer due to their false advertisement, this is no longer an all you can eat buffet< /text>

Was greeted as I walked in the door. Tables were clean and in good shape. No offensive smells. Food was prepared and cooked in quick and efficient manner. Everything I had ordered was very delicious and hot when it was served to me. It’s best to come here hungry because there is plenty of food to eat.</Review>

I've been here a number of times (lunch and dinner, over the past 3 years or so) and have always had a great experience. The decor isn't much to look at, but all of the food I've had has been extremely fresh and well-prepared. The buffet has a good variety, and all of the fresh veggies are beautiful. And you can't beat the price! Added bonus - I've got fairly serious food allergies, and the way they heat the food, it keeps your stuff on a single space on the griddle. I've been to other Mongolian places where they move the food across the whole griddle, so your stuff gets a lot of contamination from other peoples' plates, but here, your food stays on one section of the griddle until it is done.</text>

Love eating at this place all the time.  They have Mongolian BBQ and Chinese food.  Both are super delicious and have never disappointed.  When we don't feel like eating Mongolian BBQ we opt for their Chinese food which is made fresh to order. Mongolian Beef is so nice and tender, love all the green onions they add to it.</Text>

Although the food is tasty. The signs are very misleading!! They tell you one bowl for $7.99 then they charge you for an extra bowl for the noodles. My husband and I ate here & we each got one bowl but we were charged an all-you-can-eat price! I thought the noodles and the vegetables & meat and sauces were all included in that price but apparently not. Just be aware that you will be charged extra for the noodles!!
We got two bowls and Ice Tea & it  was $30!!
Unfortunately We won't be back!!< /Review>

<Review>It’s very good food however, besides messing up my order (they fixed it of course) I started eating my food and found big piece of paper in my food. I really like this place because I sometimes come here but with this experience I will be rethinking on coming again, it took a while for them to fix me order after I told them they did something wrong and the cashier lady looked angry at me like if messed it up.

When it's busy, you can go on both sides of the food area. They have menu items too but it's basic Chinese food and pretty low quality.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Mongolian BBQ Moreno valley is a good place to enjoy the Mongol bbq when you have that taste desire.  Good selection and they do a nice job cooking.  Just a nice place to eat.<//text>

WARNING!!!!!!! This place is terrible! I paid $30 dollars for rock hard, flavorless food! I will never eat here again. The food was by no means worth $30 dollars. The idiots combined my plate with another, which really screwed up my mix. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!! The employees hardly speak english, which only made the communication that much more difficult, after I did my best to be kind regarding the terrible, rock hard food and poor service!!!!!!!!! DO NOT DINE HERE!!!!!!!< /text>

<Review>The worst customer service.  This place would be great if the "manager" learned how to provide proper customer service. This woman who claims to be the manager was extremely rude . She brought the wrong order out and when we asked for utencils and napkins she proceeded to point to where the napkins and utencils were. She never brought them I had to get up and get them myself. Mind you there were no other people there. When it came time to pay i  asked for a box she compleately ignored me.  I had to ask another man if he could get me a box. Then when I asked how much she pointed to the register. Idk what her issue was but if she hates attending to customers she is in the wrong business.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Mass array of vegetables, proteins, and sauces. If you are not wanting the bbq, they have many other options such as soup, chicken, etc. End it with an assortment of desserts there is jello, cream puffs, etc. A very welcoming presence that invites you in.<//text>

<review>I was there today for the 1st time.
For those that haven't had Mongolian BBQ yet It's just like Hitachi you choose your type of meat your veggies,spices add ons(onions,pepers,cilantro,scallions,jalapenos etc....)And than your sauces of preference. It can be hot or not+noddles.They have egg holls or dumplings as appetizers if you prefer you can choose (all ypu can eat or a box.(mixed up all ingredients u choose in one box.
Its Absolutely delicious.
They have Fountain drinks and a fe variety of ice tea and supposedly Peak ice tea.That is the only reason why they will Not get 5 stars from me bcz there was np other flavor of peak ice tea avalaible then raspberry ,sweet tea and unsweetened was all water.
Butthe place was clean prices wete reasonable .Good customer service.
I recomend.</review>< pictures>

Food is good, Service is the WORST!!!  You have to to ask for drink refills, I've actually just got up and refilled my own drink on a few occasions, and you have to tell them what you ordered when you go to pay which is annoying...  Also although they don't want anyone to know (which was obvious by the way they hid that I was getting them) you can get 5 free OLD FISHY TASTING shrimp 1x only...<//text>

<Time>1453785731354</Time><Rating>4<//Rating><Text>This restaurant is surprisingly healthy and tasty!  The way it works is that you get a bowl or two and fill it with veggies, frozen strips of meat and you get a bowl of egg drop soup, rice and bread.  Of course you can go low carb and ditch the rice, bread and noodles and getting only veggies and meat which makes it pretty tasty.  You can buy the all you can eat deal and go back for as many helpings as you'd like.  Part of me is kinda put off because the veggies seem to be canned and the meat is obviously frozen so there's no way to really know the quality of the food you're eating.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

However recently their was a very nice man who worked their who did a spectacular job waiting me and my family, we gave him a $5 dollar tip and he looked at us with fear in his eyes and said "is she looking". An Asian woman, the manager perhaps, was observing the man cruely. When we went outside we noticed the woman yelling at him as he cleaned where we ate and where others ate as well. Eventually we watched the woman snatch the tip we gave out of his pocket (she put his hands on him obviously). I've never seen such a cruel person in the work place, and the act of placing her hands on him is illegal I'm pretty sure. My mom and dad ran in to confront her with no luck of changing her perspective, something must be done about this woman. Other the place is nice.</Review><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

horrible horrible service. Food is great and all, but when we asked for an interview for my class project they were so rude about it, I understand it’s their right to say no, but they were very rude about it. They also were giving my friends and I cruel stares and looks when we tried to talk to their cooks to get their perspective on the restaurant, something must be done the women and man are very rude.<//Review>

<Review>Though the $10.95 special does come out to around $12.00 after taxes are put on this is still a fiarly good deal. Make sure you grab more than one bowl to split up your ingrediants as there is not a maximum bowl amount that the staff will mix. Make sure to put plenty of sauces in it to give the BBQ some extra taste. The hot sauce will definitely kick it up a  notch.

The desert table leaves a bit to be desired but the cake was surprisingly good.</Review>< user>

Bad customer service !
Lady does not understand English and served us eggrolls to substitute egg soup but never said she was going to charge us. She did not want to take it off bill.  Bad experience.< /review>

Very bad service I asked the server a questions about the pricing because it is very misleading and she basically handed me the paper menu and told me to figure it out then I asked her again to explain a and she pointed to the paper and said look. Very rude not how people should be treated when eating at THEIR restaurant.< /text>

this place is great. for the price can't beat and its local. the only place better is probably GEN in riverside but thats a different type of cuisine.
only thing that sucks is you can't take your leftovers. i'd ask for a huge plate and take that home<//Review>

Great price for what you get for. Starts getting busy around 6:30 for dinner. You got alot of choices in meats (chicken, beef, turkey, lamb, imitation crab, and pork). Not the prettiest place but the food speaks for itself for $8.99 not including tax and tip.< /Review>

I went there for the first time today because I was curious about trying Mongolian beef and I'm glad this was the place I went to. You get to fill up a bowl with whatever you want and as much as u want. I had trouble with mine as I didn't know you could seriously put a bunch of food in it and the man there helped me...he added more chowmein and filled it with sauces.....it was very delicious....very friendly staff too.....go to this place, like SERIOUSLY!!<//review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The food is good, the bad thing is the Chinese lady who charges is looking at what you do and it seems that she is always angry she does not have good customer service I do not know how to speak English my Spanish I think I am afraid to go to school to learn the Chinese language ... .
..

(Original)

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Mongolian rotisserie with great weight for Taiwanese
Also a bit of a table meal
The taste is very salty and oily
Occasionally gathering with friends is suitable for 啰
a little bit accustomed to people 🙋

對台灣人來說份量極大的蒙古烤肉店
也有點餐方式的桌菜
口味很鹹很油
偶爾跟朋友聚聚適合囉
稍微有點吃不慣的人🙋< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I had a terrible experience unfortunately I’ve been taking out a loan and the representative didn’t adhere to my request causing a misunderstanding and when it came time to pay the loan it was sooner than expected instead of offering me a promise to pay option like the representative over the phone she informed me there’s nothing she can do and the new system will withdraw it out of my bank account I then told her I’ll just have to do a stop payment I hung up and found out I would have to know the exact amount so I called back I was told 235 is the amount to pay back which was a lie and the woman was being very rude placing me on hold and not saying anything I became upset because I knew that wasn’t the exact amount she hung up on me I called a third time and spoke with the 3rd employee where she told me 223 which again was a lie come to find out after speaking to the employee that gave me a promise to pay my amount was 223.49 I asked her to escalate the situation and received a phone call from their supervisor where I was accused of saying I was outside and going to hurt someone she cut me off while I was explaining what happened like she already knew she informed me they don’t have to verify your name before speaking about your account had to contact corporate waiting to hear back will let you know what happens< /Text>

Allied Chiropractic has been the most amazing care and service! I have had nothing but genuine care from Dr. Shaver, Dr. Val and the helpful staff. The medical treatment I received was therapy that has made my road to recovery so amazing. I was given detailed diagnosis & education to continue the progress I have gained. Literally my quality of life has improved physically because of the knowledge and care! Thank you so much!

What can I say about Dr Shaver that everyone probably hasn't already said. Very professional and Knowledgeable. Dr Shaver takes your case very seriously and recommends the best solution and treatment for your specific needs.  He is very compassionate and caring when it comes to your concerns. He kept me very informed about my processes and what to expect throughout my treatments. Thank you for helping me through these tough times.</text>

Dr. shaver and his office staff  are incredible. So professional and caring. I walked out after only one adjustment feeling so much better. I have been other chiropractors and did not get as much relief after a full course of treatment.  As I did today with only one visit.</text>

They got me in right away with care and support. They were able to assess and treat me and my three children 4,1, and 1. We have had excellent support and service with provided knowledge of service I could understand to get us all back to full healing.</text>

Dr. Shaver is an amazing doctor. Is great at explaining the medical issues you have and he makes you feel comfortable. Doesn’t it even feel like I’m at a chiropractor office.</Text>

<user_name>Tyler Barnes<//user_name><response>None< /response><Review>Let’s straighten this thing out right now! Allied Chiropractic is the real deal. Such Kind hearted people that convey a professional demeanor. Especially Sarina the lovely receptionist! She was able to direct me in the right steps! While walking in everyone treated me like family. Dr Val greeted me and built rapport with me right away! Medical with strong customer service is unheard! well, not anymore l! At least with Allied Chiropractic!

They know their craft and get the job done right! I’m shocked to see the broad scope of treatment they have available that are both holistic and aim to actually make you better! Where as traditional medicine is for the pocket of big pharma oops said it not gonna take it back! They really care about the betterment of their clients not just what they can bring to the bank! Idk about you but this is a major plus and is why I will continue to come here!</Review><userid>117988484332819108306< /userid></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I’m a new patient and I have to say I’m very impressed. As an RN it’s pretty hard to be impressed by doctors but both Dr. Shaver and Dr. Val are just extraordinary. They are both fountains of knowledge!! The staff is very helpful and friendly and they keep everything tidy and clean. Strongly recommended!!👍🏻</Review>

My wife and I are now patients and find his honesty and alternative thinking in that everything is connected in the body to degrees refreshing.

Purchased new tires there. Fantastic cash price. Includes lifetime balance and flat repair.One tire lost the weight and became unbalanced. They repaired it for free, quickly and made sure I was happy. They also notice a lug lock that had bad threads and replaced it.Great service and warranty.Highly recommended.< /review>

<Review>They are very helpful... bought a set of tires for my daughter's car. The rim was bent they fix it for a small charge. Then a week later my car was shaking I thought I might need an alignment they checked my tires. They found a huge ball if fix a flat in side my tire. They cleaned out my tire and only charged me 20.00 for balancing all four tires... I was extremely thankful< /Review>< username>

<Text>We bought a used tire and we didn’t notice how damaged it was because they put the bad side facing inwards. Our tire blew out the same day not even 2 hours after purchasing it, let alone that they completely stripped our lugnut, so I took us almost two days to get the right tools to replace the tire. Will never go here again< /Text>< pics>

<review>This is the main place I go for tires. Incredible  shop with a cautious and learned staff, and the owner gives me a great deal. His costs are focused with the chains yet every client is dealt with like you are a companion and friend. No canned reactions, every client is assessed as a one of a kind case and the prescribed tires are outfitted to the best esteem. This is a car fortune and Sacramento is fortunate to have such business.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user>

I took my truck to these guys to get my new tires mounted and balanced.  They mounted my tires but they did not balance them.  I am an ex-mechanic and currently have 5 ASE certifications.  The only reason that I don’t work on cars anymore is because I have an office job now, that pays more.  I saw  them put new balancing weights on my rims without using the tire balancing machine.  Plain and simple, these guys are crooks.  If they tried to balance my tires but couldn’t, I would not have a problem with them.  But, they tried to make it look like they did something when they never did.  There are plenty of cheap tire shops within 1 mile of them, go there instead.  I know they are a cheap tire shop but at lease do what I paid you to do.  In my opinion it’s the same as stealing if a tire shop says they are going to do something, you pay them to do it, and then they lie to your face and only do half of the job.  Before I left I talked to the owner and I got the sense that this was not a big deal,  I think they pull this sort of stuff all the time.  It seemed like the owner didn’t care, he just wanted my money.  Because I went to this place, I will have to pay another shop to do half of the job that they did not do.<//text>

The service is good and the thing I liked the most was the it was matter of in-and-out, quick service. i called in and asked them about my truck's tires, which they had in stock with really good price. went to down to the shop and they put the tires on in the time they told me. Definitely recommend if you want quick service.< /text>

< Review>
Got a set of tires here about 3 months ago. Was happy with the service was told I would get one free tire rotation. Went there today to get my tires rotated and was told off by the owner who told me that I would get one. He started to call me a thief and cussing in front of costumers. I told him it's cool if he didn't want to honor his word and would deter people to not come here. He tried to have someone do it,but was still cussing at me so I went somewhere else.< /Review>

Thank you guys. I'm almost home after my vehicle sat in a parking lot with ruined rim for 2 days. Couldn't find anything local to low Sierra Nevada mountains. Worth the drive.< /text>

The three barbers here are top notch. You can walk-in or make an appointment. They offer fades to scissor cuts, so no matter the style they will hook you up!< /review>

I've been coming here for my haircuts for the past four years. Tony is fast and skillful with his haircuts. He is also very good to have a conversation with while getting you a haircut. I recommend anyone to come get their haircut here.<//Text>

Love to come here for my haircuts and my husband's, the barber is very skilled, show him a picture of front and back of a hairstyle cut once, twice at most and he'll do a fantastic job. That's why I'm a regular. 🌷🌻<//review>

<review>I am stuck on this place. I only see one man working -the owner- and he is always very quick and efficient. I had 3 people ahead of me yesterday and was in and out of there in 30 minutes! Mind you, I always get my hair layered.<//review>< Pics>

Tony does a great job at cutting men’s hair styles. I get the same type of haircut every time, so I can’t say if he is able to vary from the standard Asian male style. Reasonably priced, but parking can be tricky at busy times because of the nearby Chinese restaurant. Trying to catch him near opening when he’s fresh and there’s no line, because the quality of the hair cut declines when he’s rushed or tired (understandably).<//Text>

Went there to get a car detailed based on clearly posted prices on website (Complete detail - $189). Made the appt to go in and was told that there would be an extra $40 surcharge for it being a SUV (totally fair) and an extra $65 surcharge for it being really dirty (a little less fair, but ok). Finally, I was told that the total price of $294 was only for the basic detail and did not include the buffer, the clay treatment, or the wheels. When they overheard me discussing the additional costs on the phone with someone else, they offered to match the price on their own website if I had proof, but who wants to do business with a company who lacks integrity? Not me.< /text>

< review>
I have been using Pacific Beach car wash for many many years as well as the Shell gas station that it is a part of. Now that I no longer need the gas I still go here for the carwash. It is a quick drive through car wash that uses blowers and a big curtain of Chamois to dry your vehicle after your choice of a regular Plus premium or Ultra Deluxe car wash. The Prices range from about 8 to 20 bucks but the feature I use is the car wash Club. For as little as $20 per month for the regular wash you can get unlimited washes each month. They also have an array of vacuums to use 4 coins but included with your car wash club. I must add that I have put all kinds of vehicles successfully through this car wash with no negative effects always a nice clean wash and that the staff is generally very friendly and helpful so it's really a good place to go.<//review>

Great deal. $7 for a wash and it includes a token to vacuum your car. Bring a towel to wipe down the excess water and you're good to go.< /text>

<text>Purchased an extreme car wash. The machines shut off half way through. So I go back around to tell them and they tell me to get back into line. 10 cars deep. When I get back in, they only do a regular wash. What a joke!</text>< Pics>

This is my go-to car wash in the Pacific Beach/La Jolla area. All employees are very courteous and helpful. The car wash itself is reasonably priced for how well it cleans each car. I have an SUV and I am never disappointed in how quickly the line moves, and efficiently the wash cleans my car, and how accessible vacuums, air, etc are on site. Next time you're in the area, give this car wash a try!< /review>

Product is very good. Monthly membership is reasonable and the line goes very quickly.
Disappointed in the management though. Been going there for 6years and manager didn’t care that the car wash was randomly closed for the better part of a week. Asked for one free wash to give a friend because I had to purchase car washes elsewhere and was still paying on my monthly membership while the wash was down. Manager pretended he couldn’t do anything. Good car wash, lousy service that is almost customary for pacific beach.< /review>

Standard gas station car wash. Nothing special. Back hatch and wheels still show dirt after the wash. No interior cleaners. Do-it-yourself vacuuming included (token provided when you pay for wash) but doesn't last long enough to get to all carpets, mats, etc.<//Review>

This review is specifically for Tony's detailing service. What a great find! Tony could not have been friendlier, more courteous or more professional. He left my car looking amazing and I could not recommend him enough! To be clear, the car wash is located within the Shell gas station (cheap gas there, btw). You'll see the gas station, then the car wash. Tony is located on the side of the property opposite the gas pumps. If you come in closer to the pumps, it's difficult to see Tony's spot as the large auto carwash is in the way... Just drive around it to find Tony on the other side.</Review>

What a cold hearted manager Jordan who doesn’t care about anything except for the company policy which is “they don’t wash rental cars what so ever”. Sadly, my new car got stolen about 10 days ago so I’m renting a car for 2-4 weeks. But Jordan says “it doesn’t matter even though I’m bringing the exact same rental car until my recovered car gets fixed from a collision center.  That’s the company’s policy and rule. No exception.”

I hope the owner of this car wash place reads it, but I know they break many rules as I noticed within 2 y ears. Even the car wash itself got some problems such as turning around the driver’s side mirror as well the water leaves many stains.

By the way, I have been a customer for almost 2 years at this car wash place. I believed that there are good people work very hard and the company seems to care its customers’ happiness. I try to bring pizza once a month to those folks to support them to run this old school car wash business smoothly.

Oh well. I cancelled my membership for good. I hope they could survive long enough to beat all these high tech car wash places!!!< /Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80dc01c87d3f5143:0x2a1c3cbaaf732778</Gmap_id><Name>Savannah< /Name><Text>It’s okay. I get Premium for $10 (second from top tier service) each time I come. My car enters fairly dirty (dirt from two weeks on a white car in fair commute traffic, and whatever the weather may bring). I figure my car should leave clean with no dirt, however I find I always end up scrubbing off the tougher spots with my own towel afterwards.

The dryer NEVER EVER actually dry my car, rather just spread around the water that it put on. Again, using my own towel to actually dry my car.

The reason I come back is for the vacuums. Until I find better vacuums close by, or vacuums at a lower cost for the time (FREE for 6 minutes with service or $2 for 6 minutes without service) I’ll use these.<//Text><Rate>3< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

I believe there are 4 levels of car washes. I got the second cheapest from the bottom and it did a great job. Plus they give you a free token to vacuum your car. Vacuum was strong and I believe the timer shows you get it for about 4 minutes.<//Review>

They just replaced some equipment making it more truck friendly for 1500's to 3500's. No DRW though, they won't fit on the guides. Does a decent job at getting your vehicle clean. Best deal around with the car wash club.< /Text>

<text>Went here a few weeks ago to get my car cleaned.  I asked attendant is they had a Military Discount.  He said they did every Monday. I came by here today, a Monday,to get my truck cleaned.  Asked again if they had a Military Discount to be sure.  The attendant said yes.  I showed him my ID...I am a retired Marine.  He said you have to be in uniform. I said that is not what I was previously told and that I had purposely driven out of my way to come back and on a Monday.  I asked him if he he was going to Honor what I was previously told. He said no.  As I was backing out, I had thought about the fact that they don't have a legit Discount in that Marines don't wear their Cammie Uniform out in town, and no one is going to drive through a car was with their Blues or any other dress uniform on.  It's sad that a place of business says they has a discount when they don't. I will not be taking any of my vehicles here again.  The first wash I received on my car was only ok, but with the Discount, I could have overlooked a couple things. But not at full price, especially when I was both lied to, and then the place of business would not stand behind their word... attendant or not, he represents their business and $2-3 Discount would not have bankrupt them, but could have kept me coming back.

I have been going to this car wash for a while and the last time I went I noticed scratched on both sides of the top of my car from this car wash. If you care about scratches on your car don’t use this car wash.</Review>

Great hair cuts at a regular reasonable price. Also, great beard trimming and up-keeping, before the pandemic. No inflated priceslike other pretentious "hip" barbers,. Just great value and great service.<//text>

Weekends are fairly busy but worth the wait in my opinion. So far I haven't  been disappointed in any of the barbers. This is one of the few barbers shops in the area I've actually does razor fades with straight razors. Old school barber shops are far and few now a days. This one definitely Give me that classis barber shop feeling.< /review>

Went here yesterday, excellent service! Sat down for a minute or two and it was my turn. Barbers are bilingual and very kind. The guy who cut my hair did a great job. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. Was $18 for my haircut.< /text>

Great barbershop. Old school barbershop. Gabby helped and did a great job. She even offered to trim my eyebrows. They take your temperature before you go in, and they fully sanitize after every customer. I will be returning!< /Review>

One of the fastest haircuts I’ve ever gotten. I’ve been without a haircut for 2 months and my hair was LONG. It took them about 15 to get me looking right and ready for my meeting. I got a 1->2 fade on the sides, half trim on top and razor all around, you can’t beat their prices!</review>

<review>I used to go to this spot exclusively. The final straw for me was when I had to endure a barber cutting my hair who's breath smelled like manure. He was a big guy and was smelled extremely unpleasant. The only guy who had any talent there was the owner, the guy with a little mustache. His daughter, Vivi, (I believe, I saw her picture) is also the worst. She takes forever to cut your hair and doesn't even know how to yet I have to pay her like a professional. Worst fades. I will never return to this place and strongly urge everyone to go elsewhere. Overpriced, no talent, and absolutely disgusting. I would rather cut my hair myself.<//review>< pictures>

Seems like Gustavo N. Is a fraud. Funny you posted about a barber "vivis" that hasnt worked there for over 3 years? Seems like you are a hateful person, I have been going to that shop for years. HANDS down best barbers in Chino for over 45YEARS!< /Text>

<review>I was looking for a dentist because the dentist I had was at least I thought was a dentist that was honest and caring come to find out he was just a rip off.So I went to work searching out a new dentist a stumbled upon west coast dental everyone here so far I can say has been very professional straight forward caring and friendly. I love that Mrs.Audi. Doctor I saw made it personal she made sure my needs were met and I was completely okay.,.Dr.Audi... she saved me a lots of money when previous dentist stated I needed some that was not going to work long term offered suggestions and provided options.  So far so good you all rock West Coast Dental...my visit was amazing my mother now wants to switch offices great job team</review><time>1618602476470<//time>< userid>

< review>
I had to find a new dentist for a senior family member. The experience at Dental Associates of Torrance was great. I’m real big on customer service. Staff is friendly and attentive. Dr. Audi was informative and understood how to take care of a new patient that happens to be 90 years old. Thank you all for your professionalism.</review>

< Review>
I had a wonderful experience during my visit. The office was clean and the staff was very nice. The x-ray technician Lizette was phenomenal. I explained to her my fears of being nervous and having gagging issues. She then assured me that everything was going to be okay. She did a wonderful job with keeping me calm and there was no gagging for the first time.<//Review>

The service itself on my first visit was good, and the people I met when I was first there nice. They took X-rays and recommended a follow up procedure. However, when my insurance denied the procedure nobody at the office called me to discuss options. Worse, nearly every attempt to call and speak with someone resulted in my being placed on hold until the line would eventually disconnect my call.<//Text>

<Text>My appointment was at noon but by 4:30 PM I still hadn’t seen the dentist. I waited for 4 1/2 hours and finally left because I just couldn’t take waiting anymore.

There is usually a 1 to 2 hour wait time because they do crazy overbooking.

In addition, the crown on my tooth that they put in a year ago has cracked. I’m pretty sure that they’re supposed to last longer than that.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>116246873597868177681<//user_id><Response>None< /Response><Time>1620778661258<//Time><Gmap_id>0x80c2b4d3160dc99b:0xc9bc7a0be1a31a91< /Gmap_id><rating>1<//rating>< user_name>

2nd Visit: Well I guess everything we experienced on the initial visit won’t be duplicated. Today was overwhelming. Arrived @930am for a 10am appt and wasn’t seem until 11:08am. Yep, 11:08am. While being attended to we find out we have another appointment within the office that we were NEVER told was occurring today. I have to go check-in and fill out more forms AGAIN. Made two payments when it could have been done ONCE. Today’s service...disappointing.< /Text>

The customer service provided by the front office staff is TERRIBLE...or it couldn’t be any worse than what i’ve just experienced. They show no care or concern to the customer. They show no respect to appointment time and let it goes by with zero regard. And their attitude is not in the right place where required customer service. My appointment was at 3pm. I waited for 45min with no sign to check in. After asking the front office staff a few times to see when i would be called in, they told me there are till 2 patients ahead of me. Simple question...why scheduled my appointment at 3pm. I ended up to cancel my appointment because I wanted to waste zero time to this place.<//review>

<review>My special needs brother was unable to find a dentist that could take care of his urgent care needs. Dr. Amal Audi took excellent care of him and made him feel comfortable despite his tooth pain. The service was so good that my mother is now a patient as well.

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Overall I was very satisfied with the customer service and care at this dentist office. I recently changed insurance and wasn't able to keep the same dentist who I really liked. So I was a little nervous and already not looking forward to it, but the staff here were really welcoming. The dentist was friendly and professional. I also felt like the guy who did my deep cleaning- Chris- was really professional and easy to talk to, and he did an excellent job on my cleaning. When I first arrived there was someone who was unhappy because the appointments were delayed. I did have to wait an hour before I was seen, but after the good care I received I felt like it was worth the wait. I could see why they were delayed because they give exceptional care to each individual---and that takes time! There may be unexpected things that arise too so when you go to any dentist- don't be in a hurry. Thank you Dental Associates of Torrance!< /text>< pictures>

<Name>Jenna Arold<//Name><Time>1611623996153<//Time><rating>1< /rating><review>My first time coming here was for a simple cleaning and I waited 2 hours just to go back and get my X-rays. Then while I was back there they took another 40 minutes for to meet with me and then they would leave for 20+ minutes at a time. I waited almost 3 hours for a 10 minute cleaning during a school day. Then they asked if I wanted to wait another “40 minutes” to get some fillings. We knew it was going to take another 2 hours so we decided to leave.

I came back again a few weeks later to get my wisdom teeth removed and I had my appointment at 7:00 because they claimed I would get in immediately and I would be the first one the doctor would see. Lies! I got there at 6:45 and the doctor didn’t see me until 8:30. When he did come back he introduced himself and then left for another 25 minutes. They didn’t actually do the surgery until 9:00ish. After the surgery, they left me in the there for a long time and then barely helped me to get up and walk out to my family while I was still loopy and drugged up from the medication they gave me.

I also needed to get some fillings and they rescheduled not once, not twice, but three times. I’ve been waiting for an hour and a half in the parking lot and they just called saying that we will have to come back again in another week. My original appointment was 4 weeks ago and know it will be 5 weeks if I’m lucky! I’m a high school student and I can’t be missing school over an over because I’m waiting to get a few fillings.

When they say your appointment is at 3:00 they really mean more around 5:00 or 6:00 if you are lucky. The people who work here have no respect for peoples time, they just want your money. After I finish up with my fillings, it will be the last time I will come here. 3 strikes and you’re out! Do better Dental Associates of Torrance!!

If I could I would give them ZERO stars!< /review>< Pics>

What an amazing staff! Im normally scared of the dentist but this appointment was actually not torture for 2 wisdom teeth extractions! Woman taking my xrays was so kind and caring. Especially checking in on me from a long wait because of the xray machine was down. I am so happy the doctor waited for the best xray results before working and when he did he worked so fast and knew how to calm me down when I'm so scared at the dentist I shake for hours-Normally! But not this time! Such a great experience. Fast! Such an efficient staff and trusting process for being a procedure such as 2 wisdom teeth.</review>

Everytime I go see my dentist Brittney the X-Ray technician has been so helpful and great with me. She makes patients feel like royalty by taking the time to not only do her job but also treat every patient with kindness and make you feel comfortable.</review>< pics>

<Review>Dr. Amal Audi and her assistant Maria Villareal are outstanding. They took such good care of my children, were respectful and showed how much they cared through their kindness.

Patty, the manager is a delight and always ensures my family is taken good care of.

You are appreciated!< /Review>< pictures>

Horrible long wait give you wrong info over the phone just so you come in. Then say that info is incorrect. And look at you like your lying. My appointment was at 2Pm Today and wasn’t seen until 3:30pm. Why schedule so many people at the same time? Makes no sense to me. People have things to do too! Front desk show no care in the world and are just sitting there staring at their screens and get bothered when you get up to ask questions! Front desk ladies were also unfriendly didn’t make you feel welcomed at all. Will Not be returning nor recommending. Oh the cherry on top which Jade me walk out was the X-ray lady was very rude, rough and seemed angry or like she hates her job! She shoved the thing for X-rays in my mouth so hard it cut me. Then yanked it out like if I wasn’t a human. Horrible horrible don’t not come here! You’ve been warned!</Review>

We waited for over an hour to see the dentist for my 2 year old’s first little check up only to be told it was another 30 min wait. To expect people to wait 1.5 hours from your appointment time is not ok especially with a toddler so we left and will find another dentist.

<Resp>None< /Resp><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Great staff! Patty thoroughly breaks down costs and payment options, while scheduling future appointments are made easy through Melissa and the ladies in the front. Appointment reminders are texted, which are helpful.

Dr. Audi and her team of ladies in the back do a good job explaining the procedures and what needs to be done. They answer your questions and are very accommodating.

Oral Surgeon comes in twice a month, and those days seem to be the busiest.

Overall great experience—I’ve already recommended to my family.<//text>< Rating>

Their service is great, and they prioritize each and every patient based on their needs.

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>I would not recommend this office for orthodontic services. The orthodontist is only there once a week, appointments are often cancelled at the last minute by the office and it is a revolving door with different  doctors.  Appointments are difficult to obtain since the orthodontist is only there once a week. There is no continuity of care, no return calls, always mix-ups and no accountability.  Though cheaper than other offices, it is not worth the savings. Run away from this office. Fast!</text>< gmap_id>

However, the front desk receptionist is very pushy. She kept insisting on scheduling me for the actual oral surgery even after I continuously told her I first wanted to know what my insurance covered. She then proceeded to pushing on a bone implant procedure (which is unnecessary/“recommended” for the healing process) that my insurance doesn’t cover.

I don’t think I will be coming back. I only went in for a consultation because my current dentist (which I’m extremely happy with) doesn’t provide oral surgery services.< /text>< UserId.>

< Review>
When I chose this dental office,I was under the impression that because it was in a good area dental care and service would be good,truly sad that it was not the case.I had called and scheduled an appointment in Feb. With Dr. Audi for treatment and scaling of my teeth,when I spoke to the female that took my call assured me that I would be scheduled Saturday with my Dr. And for the set procedures.When I got there the front desk workers did not even see me on the schedule  stating that they never scheduled me in instead it was some sort of a different call center that should not given me the schedule.so they ended squizing me in with another dentis,who actually thought was cool and funny.I believe his name was Alvaro. The manager ofcourse apologized and had me schedule my appointment for my scaling today Saturday,I thought today would be a good day since the manager scheduled my appointment, well again I checked in at 1:45 pm. And my appointment was for 2pm,and I was not brought in to the treatment room till 2:28pm then I sat there even more till I asked the dental assistant  when was Chris the hygienist come to see me,she said she would find out she came back just to tell me they had a patient ahead of me and then I'm next...At that point I'm like no this is just no good and got up from my chair the dental assistant was embarrassed  and apologized but I told her not to because ult6it us not her fault,the front desk or someone upfront is not coordinator  or allocating the correct time for each patient and procedures..They are more likely double booking to try to make there quota at the patients time....thinking it's ok to be treated like cattle.I was truly dissapointed not I went through this a second time,not sure why they wouldn't write notes on my file or somewhere so that they can see that I had gone throught disappointment last time and this time they should have prepared better..but that's not the case..I spoke with the front desk and explained,and Express my disappointment and let them know that I have been in the dental field for over9 years and that I was an RDA as well and I know what is going on and how my situation should have been handled...to there disbelief there faces changed and could not tell me anything..I will no longer go to this dental office...there not considerate of the patients time  and they do not honor your appointment time.<//Review>

Appointment was at 10am. Over an hour waiting in the lobby I was taken back for X-rays. X-ray tech had the personality of a rock. Then I was taken to an exam area where I then waited almost 2 hours. I got up ready to leave and told them 3 hrs was unacceptable for me to be there. My time is valuable as well. Everyone kept saying they only have 1 dr and short staffed. Not my problem. Don’t book that many appointments then. I heard other patients complain as well. The dentist asked me to give her 5 minutes. I reluctantly did. Then she wants to try to up-sale me on a crown and inlay that I don’t need. My insurance would not cover this so I would have to pay out of pocket around 2k. My appointment was supposed to be for a teeth cleaning. Spent over 3 hrs and walked out without teeth cleaning because they have to get insurance approval first. I understand this but should’ve been authorized before my appointment. So they immediately knew my insurance would not cover a crown and inlay, but don’t know if my insurance covers a teeth cleaning for what my appointment was for...?? No one looked happy to be there other than the girl at the front door checking people in. Not 1 person introduced themselves to me. Overall experience was horrible. No real customer service. If teeth cleaning is approved then I will go back there but in the meantime looking for a different dentist. Horrible experience< /Text>

You’re sending me a survey while my daughter and I have been waiting almost 2 hours at your Torrance office. I would have given you zero star for our experience. Our appointment was for 3:30 and it’s 5:20 now and she’s still waiting to be seen. This is horrible experience. Two hours wasted waiting. I believe you need to think about opening a couple of days or more a week instead of once a week and having all these people waiting crazy hours.
Consider opening more days. 9/15/2020 and it’s 5:24pm and we’re still waiting.</review>

I’ve now been in the back room in a dental chair waiting for 30 minutes for doctor. They just need to file a tooth. Quick procedure. They ordered me a veneer filling for a back tooth instead of the more reasonable silver filling. They talk you into doing payment plans. I feel that they try to make as much money off you as they possibly can. I’m very disappointed. I arrived at 11:00 and it’s currently 12:50 and still have not been seen. This place is not honest. Don’t waste your money and don’t let them talk you into a payment plan. Be careful. They’ll take the most expensive route they possibly can with your teeth.</Text>< pics>

Just got new insurance due to switching jobs. When I went here for the first time, Dr. Daniel Sako told me I had severe gingivitis. This was strange to me, as I've never had any indications of gum disease. I'm also 24. I heard them telling two other patients in the office that they had infected gums that needed deep cleanings. I thought something was off, but I paid for them to give me a deep cleaning and 3 antibiotics. I then went to another dentist for a second consultation, and they said I have no indications of gingivitis and not to go back there. Don't come here!! They are scammers!

Grace Ramirez in the office is also incompetent. It took her over a week to send my x rays to my new dentist. She probably knew they were going to get caught in a lie. lol. Do not recommend.</review>

<Text>“It’s All About Customer Care”

Cons :
This dental office is the Pits. They Have been overbooking appointments for years. I have called the corporate offices and asked them to explain to me why would they allow 11 appointments to be booked at the same time 8:00am in the morning with one hygienist, and one Dentist?

The Corporate office is full of it also, for the first few years every single appointment that I have had was never serviced on time. I complained too the corporate office so much that they gave a director to note in chart and in their internal system computer system for me or my family members to be seen on time and not to be seen late.

That was 5 years ago 😏, and I have yet to be seen on time. This office usually runs 45 minutes to an hour late every appointment.

Pros:
If your wondering why I still continue treatment here it’s for a few reasons.

The first is I use to go to Smile Care and they would do the same overbooking practices.

The second is that this office in Torrance has a office manager named Zoila. Zoila is a caring, compassionate and understanding  Office Manger with her patients.

What do I mean by that? She is truthful, honest, kind and has worked out several payment plans for me and my family.

My wife & I have said  amongst each other several times, that if it wasn’t Zoila’s honesty, kindness, & flexibility that we would have left this office along time ago.

Just a simple suggestion please hire more people like her and retrain a few staff members in the front (All the way to the left as you walk in) and the (Know It All X-Ray Technician).

PS:
Chris is a great dental hygienist very detailed, informative and compassionate about his work.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1613604410704, 'text': 'We deeply apologize for any and all inconveniences you have experienced while in our office.

I showed up (on time) for my appointment and was ignored while I stood in the waiting room. From my view, it looked like they over-booked the early morning time slot and were under-staffed to handle the workload. There was only one receptionist working the office and she was running around trying to help people. It wasn’t her fault... I blame the staff who set up all these appointments for 8am! Disgusted with the lack of staff and over-bookings, I walked out. Not sure if I will come back to this office in the future. If I can make one suggestion... customer service is very important! Have your staff talk to your customer base when they enter the office. Assure them that they are important and that you may be busy, but you will get to them as soon as possible.  Don’t let them stand there like a ghost waiting to be helped.<//review>

Average wait time here is 2 hours like all off the other reviews say(1 in the lobby and 1 in the chair).
They are constantly trying to upsell you which is very irritating and makes them untrustworthy.
They said I needed a deep cleaning and had the receptionist explain to me before the hygienist even examined me.
I insisted I wanted the regular cleaning (free and covered by insurance) which very shockingly was around the same price as the deep cleaning< /text>

Truly aweful experience.  Pedodontist lacks ethical practices and integrity. Refused to answer questions clearly, very hostile and impatient. Refused my insurance eventhough I am supposed to go there. The den-techs were very nice. Reception nice. Overall the wait was 4 hours even with an appointmentment. I will be contacting dental board for offical complaint.< /Text>

This company's primary target is more selling and more profit. I have taken my children to two different locations in 2020 and my experience at both locations was similar. They love to sell you braces, as it is $3,000 per child and probably their most profitable item. And it all starts from the moment you call the corporate office to schedule an appointment. They want you to have consultation for braces. It is this culture that trickles down from the top and all the way to the bottom. As you enter their offices, their marketing messages for braces is all over their walls, doors and everywhere. Usually behind their schedule and a lot of waiting time. I asked their front desk that our appointment was at 9am and it is past 10 now and her reply is that they are under staff. Your turn comes and the doctor's first word is, "your child needs braces". They don't even care why are you here, in the first place. This "nurse" took x-ray and it is blurry and the doctor tells me that their machine is not designed for children. I asked the doctor that why did it work on my 8 years old child that it doesn't work on 10 year old child? She was embarrassed and told the "nurse" to take another x-ray and it came all clear. She tells me that she is not a child specialist by their is some problem with tooth number (but the letter "I"). I am like what is the problem? The doctor tells me that "I think it is cavity, but the specialist will tell you." Ok...where is your specialist, I asked? Oh, she/he is not here. I asked that you knew a few days ago that a children are coming on this day then why did you wast all my time? And then she says that I should schedule another appointment. I kind of persuaded them to at least do some teeth cleaning and that is why I scheduled this appt. and after spending 2 hours all I get is that there is some problem with tooth number "I"?</text>

<text>They are lacking in customer service, they are incompetent and money hungry. My niece needed braces.  We were told that phase 1 would work well for my niece.  However, they were constantly cancelling her appointments and then CoVid hit.  Once the office re-opened we were told that my niece now needs phase 2.  The NEW doctor said that if he continued on phase 1(which was recommended) she would end up with a squirrel mouth because of the crowded teeth.  Well, her teeth were crowded in phase 1.  We paid in full for something that was not completed or we should not have started.   They cannot even manage to schedule people to come in and out.  Everyone expect to spend at least 2 hours at this dentist office.  Who spends 2 hours for a basic cleaning?  They also lost my niece's file and asked us to fill out her paperwork all over again.  They also did not offer to discount the incomplete phase 1 completely from the quote of phase 2.  They were cold and uncaring about our situation.</text>< Name>

I wouldn’t recommend it at all. They are not organized. I had a appointment twice every time I go they say no appointment are made for you today I had appointment at 11:00Am I called they said there no appointment again which is awful but they still took me in after speaking with the doctor. Doctor seems really nice and everything but my reason today it was for cleaning basic cleaning because Im getting Invisalign braces and I made it so clear of what I want to get done and I gave them the reason why too I go there today all they did X-rays all over again and waited for the doctor she recommended couple of things which is filling, sealing, arigation. Then other lady came in I believe she’s the Financial one after quoting me everything total was around 800$ I said I’ll think about it but I would love to get the basic cleaning before i get the Invisalign braces on today. She said “oh I’m sorry unfortunately we won’t be able to do it today our next available appointment is next week on Friday” which is unbelievable. Maybe they are busy sure but they should have made it clear from the beginning instead of wasting my time. To me that’s disrespectful. Sorry I don’t now recommend this place to anyone even tho doctor seemed really nice and Brittany who helped me with the X-ray she was amazing, fast. But other than that I wouldn’t recommend it office and the front staff not really.<//Review>

<review>I got an appointment for 1:00 PM PST, checked in 5 minutes earlier. Called for xray in 10 minutes, after x-ray waited for 30 minutes for teeth gum measurement. I waited for another 2 hours until 3:30PM no one responded. I thought of asking the nurse how long it will take more to see the doctor. She has no clue what time  doctor would come and the supervisor told its their process and they don't know what time doctor will come and examine. She offered next day first appointment, unfortunately wasted three hours by taking appointment with them and not ready for another appointment...<//review>< Time>

Unfortunately, insurance companies don\'t always treat the client or the service provider fairly.  We are often told that insurance will pay a certain amount, but then the same insurance will deny payment after services have been rendered. This often leaves the patient with a large bill.

Yes this gets 1 star! The wait times is WAY too long! Like 3 hours just to get service! A simple cleaning! And one of the dental assistants was way too rude! He kept raising his voice at me to floss multiple times! I was about to get up from my chair and throw hands!! They were very rude :( that’s why I switched dentists :)< /review>

Dr. Amal Audi is an exceptional dentist because she is gentle, listens to you, and knows what she is doing.  She frequently checked in with me and made sure I was comfortable. She asked me questions to come up with solutions to my dental issues.  She made my pain and discomfort go away.  I highly recommend her.</Text>

I was just sent a text by dental associates to leave a review. It is 11:46 a.m. and our son's cleaning was scheduled for 8:00 a.m. and they are now just leaving. Another review to follow when my husband and son get home and give me the details of the horrendous wait time and staff.<//text>

Everyone here is so nice. I call and someone always answers the phone within a minute or two. The doctors always make sure you’re comfortable when getting treated and the staff is very clear when it comes to insurance coverage. They genuinely want to see you leave better than you came in. I drive 20 miles out of my way to get here. Love this place. Been coming for over two years.<//Review>

< Review>
Well, doctor comes by and tells me I have 5 cavities after waiting I don’t even know how long and leaves and says the pricing lady will come by. After waiting again, the lady comes by and just reads me a bunch of procedures that I would need and the price of it. Doctor doesn’t explain what the procedure is, why I need it and how it will help me. Nothing. This happened the last time I was here last year also. Very unprofessional and makes the patient feel like we are just a dollar amount. Why are you reading me a bunch of stuff to pay for? Without explaining anything to me?<//Review>

<text>They are always backed up with patients. They need to stop double/triple booking patients. We've had to wait 2hrs just to be seen. General dentistry and ortho don't communicate with one another. We had to wait another 30mins cuz ortho didn't know where my daughter was and they took in another patient. General kept saying that ortho knew she was still with them

<Text>Overall, great patient care. Everyone in the staff is kind and professional. Their office space is kept very clean and well organized. The staff are open and clear about any proposed treatments and associated payment options of which there are many to accommodate different financial situations. Dr. Amal Audi is very good at what she does and her team makes sure that the needs of the patient are met fully and as promptly as possible. With the patient's cooperation, I don't see how anyone can leave here without feeling that they have gotten the best dental service they can get.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><time>1590772920044< /time><user_id>111657380742135068471< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80c2b4d3160dc99b:0xc9bc7a0be1a31a91< /gmap_id></record>

<text>always behind on appointments, not consistent with treatment plan.  my daughter had seen 3 different orthodontists there in 2 years and every time we ask how much longer she will have her braces, they respond with, a month or 2, we go to ask at that time frame, it usually is another new orthodontist who has differing opinion and gives us a different spiel.  The last time she had a check up when we were told her braces were coming off, they told her nevermind because her teeth overcorrected themselves and she was too good about using the bands.  my husband had to get irate and re-inform them on what we were told 2 doctors before.  additionally, the front admin do not follow up with insurance authorizations, do not communicate with the hygienists, or add any additional concerns/relay messages when called to add in another concern on previous treatment.  i called and tried to add another treatment fix to my upcoming appt.  The admin said they would leave a note in my profile.  They didn't even ask my name or identifying questions to look up my file to add in my request.  Also, I have left messages to ask about authorizations, I give my name and phone number and don't even get a response back.   It was 3 weeks after my initial call for me to talk to someone.  I was the one calling back asking "why haven't I heard anything".  then if I get a call back, they are not looking at who left the message or what the message was, they are asking for a totally different person.<//text><rate>1<//rate><UserId.>110379526144559480414<//UserId.><GmapID>0x80c2b4d3160dc99b:0xc9bc7a0be1a31a91</GmapID><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I get very frustrated every time I enter this office. Today I had a 1:00 appointment. I wasn’t seen at all until 2:15 then had xrays which took approximately 15 mins. Then I waited and waited and waited again to see the Dentist. Spent 10 mins with him (he was very nice). Waited and waited and waited again to see the hygienist to determine cleaning. It was awful. By 4:00 — 3 hrs after my appointment I left without the cleaning — I just didn’t have any more time. Originally when I made the appointment I was told to plan to spend 1.5-2hrs. Ok, that’s what I planned for — not 3 hours!!

Also, I was told I needed a deep cleaning ($220 out of pocket) and they wouldn’t do a regular cleaning ($0 out of pocket) if I didn’t get the deep cleaning done. My previous dentist had never mentioned the need for a deep cleaning so I’m a little suspicious about that as well.

I’ll be going back to my regular dentist even though my insurance does not cover his office. I will pay out of pocket for someone I trust.</Text>

One star is too good!

Poorly managed front office - 6 weeks between exam & treatment appointment,  cancelled day prior stating authorization not received, but according to dental insurance, in fact,  authorization was NOT even submitted.<//review>

We had a great experience at this dental office! My daughter had several procedures completed in a single visit. At first, she was a reluctant and emotional patient. Dr. Dewberry and the Dental Assistant Mary were very helpful, encouraging and patient with her. Dr. Dewberry explained everything to her and worked quickly. Overall, highly recommend!<//text>

It is very unlikley that I will/would recommend your services. Ever since the previous doctor left the quality of the service has dropped dramatically. I brought my daughter in yesterday for a retainer repair. The nurse was extremely rude to my daughter and the attending othodonists offered no repair suggestions other than "you can get a new one if you want" she said she could not tighten or do anything with the retainer. My daughter attempted to explain that her teeth were starting to move and there is now a gap that wasnt there before. The nurse and ortho tried to tell my daughter that the gap was probably there all along. When I asked to speak with the attending orthodontist I was told she was busy with patients and was running behind schedule. All I wanted was for her to explain to me the options she gave to my 16yr old daughter. The last few visits have been horrible, so NO, unfortunately I will not be referring your services and will take my dentist and othodontist needs elsewhere.<//review>

Called their corporate office and the girl said they were getting multiple calls about this location. They need to do a way better job of getting them techs that can make the office run smoother. The girl at corporate also said they ask them to overbook and hope that people don’t show up. The previous ortho was amazing and ran that office like clock work. This seems to be their new way of doing business.</Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Dewberry and his assistant Merry were both so patient with my 20 month old son today! Dr. Dewberry took the time to answer all of my questions and even made a "glove balloon" for my son to get him to open his mouth for the visual exam. A very professional team and friendly polite front office staff. Highly recommend!</Text>

I am a bonafide dental coward. I actually mentally prepare myself to go, and have my treatments, essential oils, meditation, the whole she-bang! Dr. Audi and Yolly are always so sweet, understanding, and patient with me. I have gone to them for over 15 years and I am thankful to be part of their dental family. Literally the best dentist.

This place is a godsend! I am completely terrified of the dentist and this place was so gentle and made me feel like they really cared. Walking in the door, I was greeted with smiles and friendly conversation. I came in as a new patient with no insurance and they explained everything to me and had me sign up for a discount plan. The guy who did my x-rays kept making sure that I was comfortable throughout the entire process. When I got to the chair to get my work done, the next staff member that came in continued giving A+ service. Even when it came to my payment, the guy was super friendly and offered the perfect payment plan. All that to say, I’ve finally found a dental office that I plan on sticking with.</Text>

You will be waiting hours on end for a cleaning and if you're getting your teeth examines expect to waste your whole day there. Also ALWAYS ask if you are covered for any treatment they offer because they won't tell you and they are real stingy of letting you read your treatment papers that need your signature. Always check because something is crooked about this place. Look elsewhere if you can unless you want to waste a day and get ripped off so your teeth can be a bit whiter.< /review>

Great friendly staff I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to get my teeth taken care of if I  had known there was nice people like this out there
When you're in the situation I'm in where I have to get all my teeth taken out and get dentures it's kind of hard to go face people and let them look in your mouth and do work but they're very nice caring people<//Review>

The staff is very professional and organized. There are two waiting rooms. It’s was A/C controlled! I loved Dr. Choi and his Dental Assistant! Everything was as well as you could expect from a dentist! I had my own rom. There are some chairs near the pedestrian side of Hawthorne Blvd. It’s a fishbowl? Maybe private tinted glass?<//Text>

<Review>Terrible. If I could give 0 stars I would. Made an appointment for a cleaning and filling. Made me wait 1.5 hours to be seen. Tried to up sell me on stuff they even told me I didn’t need but should get just “Incase”. they kicked me out once I declined asking me to come back another to get done the same thing I had made the appointment for originally. Said I would have to wait another hour or longer to have anything done at all. 2 hours of my morning wasted. ALL THEY WANT IS MONEY. THEY TAKE THEIR SWEET TIME.

Terrible experience. Was scheduled for 4pm I  got called in at 6pm. I felt like I forced them to call me in as well. I had to complain to them every 30 minutes after waiting there for 1 hour. I felt like if I hadn’t complain about my wait they wouldn’t have ever called me in. Terrible service. I asked them if they had  skipped me and of course they denied it and claimed that the other patients that went ahead of me were old patients and that new patients had to wait for the x ray machine. Which was a lie. Never even got an apology and instead got “I don’t care what you have to say” replies . I was the last patient to leave at 7 pm. I even had arrived early to the office at 3:30pm. I seriously was in there for 3:30 hours. Never going back again.</text>

Dr. Audi was amazing exactly the kind of dentist you want to work with. She was extremely sweet and informative and made me feel like I've been a client for 20 years even though it was my 1st visit. I had a root canal and a crown which ended up being a little more expensive than I had anticipated from the little research I did I was expecting to pay $1300 but ended up paying $1700 so I feel pricing could be better but staff and end results are phenomenal.< /Review>

I will never return to this place of business. I went in to get exactractions on two teeth which I did but the experience with the OS assistant and the actual oral surgeon Mr. Choop or something with a C he comes in the office every Wednesday.....The OS assistant was already coming over very rude his name was Jessie but I knew his attitude had nothing to do with me so I didn't mind it until it was time for surgery and Jessie began to aggressively hold my head down to the point I was crying because he was extremely rough and the doctor made it no better because he was being extremely rough as well while he was numbing my mouth. After the doctor extracted one tooth I needed a break because my forehead and chin was in pain due to Jessie putting so much unnecessary force on my forehead so when I asked for a break I could tell the Oral Surgeon was highly irritated and the assistant Jessie made it no better by mumbling things while he was exiting the room as if I was wrong for asking for a quick break...moral of the story please save yourself the time.....I told the front desk I wanted to have the number to corporate but I felt as though they didn't really want to give me the number. I was asked why I needed the number and I said to file a complaint and honestly when I think about it I was given a hard time about getting corporates number so I just walked out but I will be calling in today to speak to the manager because there is no way I should've been treated like that.</Text>

Another great experience at Dental Associates of Torrance again.  Crowns, bridge, now possible periodontal work, all under one roof.  Great attentive staff.   Love this place.  Recommend this place to anyone with dentist phobias of any kind. They'll take care of you.

<review>I was very pleased with this dental office. The staff was friendly and answered all of our questions. The office and the bathroom available to us was very clean. All three of my daughters were seen for the first time in this location and on the same day. We waited about ten minutes before they started to call our girls to the back. Although they were nervous when the arrived, they all left with big pretty smiles on their faces. Their ages are 15, 12 and 7. After my daughters  appointments, I went and made one for myself.<//review><Name>Effie Tabuyo<//Name><date>1557496644252<//date>< Rating>

I used to hate going to the dentist.  Stopped going for years.  Finally came here and it was one of the best decisions I ever made.  I got a same day apt and got fillings done in that same apt.  This place is run very professionally the staff is great and makes sure that you are comfortable during your entire stay from the waiting room to the dentist chair, all your dental needs will be taken care of.  The dentist's are top notch and their assiants do a great job to.  Ask for the hot Young denist she is a pro and makes getting your teeth drilled an awesome experience.  Thanks doc I'll be back in 2 months for you to finish, I can't wait :)</text>

<text>Praise Abba Father!  I want to thank each of those who from the get go gave me their individual professional persona.
I am a tetracycline baby from back in the late 50'S and it is here where I felt Love and Care for the health of my oral hygiene. The dental hygienist was super gentle and captured great x-rays and the dentist doctor was amazing in her meticulous inspection of my choppers. Thank-you!</text><gmap_id>0x80c2b4d3160dc99b:0xc9bc7a0be1a31a91< /gmap_id>< Pictures>

On the follow up visit with my son, which was two weeks after our initial visit, we waited in the waiting room for over an hour, even though we were the 7:30am appointment. After finally taking us back, and me asking multiple times what the issue was, they finally admitted to me that they didn’t have insurance authorization to perform the restorative work that needed to be done, even though it’s their policy to not confirm appointments until they DO have authorization. We took the early appointment because they don’t want you to eat for several hours before, so it’s now almost 9am, and I have a hungry boy. I honestly think they thought I should just wait around for them to get insurance approval, even though they had two weeks to get it beforehand. We won’t be going back after this poor experience.< /Review>

<review>This place let you wait for long long time even if you have an appointment. Then they always sell you something which your insurance won’t cover.

< Review>
it always takes long as the dentist jump around and never see you on time. my husband had to get numbed 2 times because it wore off while the dentist left him to do other patients.. Basically the over book.

Then they charged him for everything in advance and when we come back for our final appt they say the did not and he has more they need to charge?

they changed the tooth that they said was now no good. He had a deep cleaning they sprayed water everywhere it was running down his back and neck he had to ask them to cover him up and if that was normal. Never had a sloppy deep cleaning like this. I will not be taking him here again.</Review>

<review>I went to this place just to get my teeth cleaned.
They took about 20 different X-RAYs over a 45 minutes span. Then made me wait 50 minutes on a dentist chair facing a wall!!! Then finally the dentist showed up and proceeded to list for me all the procedures I needed to have done even as I told her ALL I WOULD EVER DO WAS A TEETH CLEANING. She ignored me and sent in some assistant who proceeded to repeat to me the litany of the procedures I needed to have at which time, I got so f.....g frustrated I got out of my chair and left. It seems this place is only interested in making money through any means!!!
I would NEVER EVER recommend it or return there.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

I need people to know that the care,kindness and quality of dental work that is done is amazing. They treat you like a real human being. And as you have noticed the world has not been to kind to one another these last years. I really want to thank,appreciate and respect Mr. Chris my hygeinist for all his hard work,patience,kindness,tenderness,being very professional aswell as educating me with answers I can understand and better take care of my teeth. I also have been futher blessed with Dr. Dewberry who is just as gentle on my mouth,educates me and gives great metaphors so I can understand. I have a chronic medical condition and he was very understanding. Kuddos to all the ladies that are a ray of sunshine and very helpful by calling for my ride or seeing how they can get my appointments in all together since I am there. I all want to acknowledge Victor the manger who apparently is making sure things run smooth.
I also must acknowledge (please forgive mijo the names are getting scrammbled)
I think his name is Jose or Xavier. He is the sweetest young man . He assist Mr.Chris and Dr. Dewberry he makes sure I get a blanket because I get really cold. Please give these people a raise and treat them right, I say that to you corporate office. This staff is amazing. It takes alot to impress me. But I take it very seriously the way human beings get treated. So there is one final kuddos that is to you corporate office because there is an old saying 'The Fish Stinks From The Head Up!" In this case you being the head are to be congratulated that Dental Associates of Torrance does not Stink.
It is the opposite it smells like roses. So take care of the roses. Thank you very much.

<review>DO NOT GO HERE!!! I WAS LIED TO!! I went in for a cavity and a cleaning (never got the cleaning), and was told that I had no other choice but to get the most expensive filling they had. Come to find out from my insurance that I had other options. And the four hundred dollar filling I got (which they said would last over two decades) fell out a year later!! I emailed them with my frustrations and never heard back. Then I called and was told they would call me back. Never got a call back. Then I called again the next day and waited for an hour and a half on hold. When I finally got someone on the phone telling me that I was responsible for my filling falling out. They are shady and only in it for the money! They don't care about you!</review>< date>

Spending 3 hours here for a teeth cleaning isn’t a massive inconvenience, but it is a bit much in my opinion.

Very friendly staff! They made me feel welcome and took time to explain what the dentist recommend for treatment, treatment options, and discussed how to best use my insurance benefits to cover my treatment. This was just an initial visit but was still one of the best experiences at a dentist office I've ever had! Thank you!< /Text>

I went one busy Saturday, I saw a Dr. Mazloom, who was only filling in but I found Dr. to be a kind, courteous doctor, he could have told me I needed 2 crowns like I'm used to hearing dentists tell me, but he said I only needed 1 Inlay. (More than a filling, but less than a crown). And only a filling. They were very busy today. Saturday, but good enough to squeeze me in as a new patient, as I was having toothaches. They accommodated  me without waiting for my insurance to designate them, I avoided having to wait til Oct 1. Dentist was very conscientious of my needs and that I was always comfortable. The next Saturday I saw regular Dr. On Saturdays, Dr. Cardenas. He was also very kind and courteous to my needs. The only thing I really had a problem with was I arrived 11 am and I was not done, after xrays. Inlay and polishing until 4pm. I was very hungry, no lunch, hard for a diabetic like me. But I will know to bring more than the 2 snacks I had brought and ate by noon.😊

Well I just saw Dr. Audi today, Wednesday for 1st time. She just checked my mouth and told me I need 2 more teeth worked on. She didnt even take xray. She just told me she could do it today. I was only planning on having done what 1st dr said, and she added new treatment plan, didnt even tell me what had to be done. Just needed to complete a certain quota seemed like. I dont think I'll be back.</Text>

I am 28 and have only been to a regular dentist 3 times in my life due to neglectful dad/step-mom, and then my own anxiety over doctors as an adult.

This dental office was compassionate, kind, extremely observant to my needs and made sure to talk me through the harder parts of my dental work. I was shown how to floss and brush properly, and was not shamed for being neglectful of my teeth in the past. I was educated on how to go forward, and had fun learning while getting my teeth fixed.

I had a total of 8 cavities done, antibacterial work for mid level gum disease, and a full mouth four quadrants of scaling and deep clean. They accomplished everything in under 5 hours, and I left feeling satisfied with the cost, customer service and the quality of technical work they did on my teeth.
Dr. Audi, Asst. Yolly, my dental hygienist (I’m sorry, I do not remember his name), and all of the finance and front desk staff were absolutely wonderful to me.

I will always recommend them and Dental Associates of Torrance to anyone who asks for a dentist! Five stars, and my deep gratitude!</Text>

The wait is usually hours long. There is always a dental emergency ahead of us or some other issue. My sons and I have never once, in all the years I've been going here, been seen timely. We joke that we should just show up an hour late and skip most of the waiting. Another example of issues is that I've waited years with multiple appointments to have some periodontal work done. There is always some issue or someone forgot. One son is only 20. His cavity was filled at DAT. Sure enough, they found another cavity underneath the filling of the cavity they just did and charged us for the work.

But... they take our insurance so we really don't have a lot of choice.<//Text>

I went to this location for a simple dental exam and ended up coming out with a guilt feeling. After taking my xrays, their "health associate" or whatever they call (was a female) it came up to me with the lists of many UNUSUAL things/procedures that my teeth needed with an UNUSUAL COSTS!!.... And I try take care really good care of my teeth, but this was insane! So I left the crazy place and went to another much honest better quality/rating dental place and the people were SURPRISED how Dental Associates of Torrance treated me! As only needed, got my dental exam done and cleaning done and day was better👍!

First time at this office.  I have Medicare, Medicare covers x-rays cleanings.  I was shocked at the cost to rectify my dental issues, and the inflexibility of the staff/doctors to work with me.  I was told i need a deep cleaning, to the tune of $160.00.  it has only been 2 years since my last cleaning.  I scheduled the appt. to have this done.....reality, i don't have the money. I called to let the office know i just can't afford to have the deep cleaning, could I schedule a regular cleaning.  I was told "No".  The Doctor diagnosed a need for deep cleaning.  Done!  no discussion, no devising a plan of action.  I was told to call back when i can have the deep cleaning.  Has dentistry become an up-selling business?  I am very disappointed.  Shame on this business for milking the system put in place to help people.  Where did the humanity go?  Not here.  Go Go very far from here.< /text>

<Review>This a horrible place that is full of dishonest people.They told me that I cannot get my fillings until I get deep cleaning .the women in front desk told me that deep cleaning costs 570$  in cash,after negotiating I paid 500$ , I decided to get the cleaning because they told me filling is impossible without cleaning.I went to the next appointment to get cleaning and filling after.but, I discovered that they made the fillings before cleaning that was not necessary.the I told the girl on front desk that i had paid for cleaning but I didn’t get it so she took me inside again while I’m waiting for the hygienist I heard that they were offering 470$ for deep cleaning to another patient .I was shocked to know that<//Review>< UserId.>

<Text>The staff are friendly but they are a con! Took 2 hours to see the doctor, they recommended deep cleaning for $550. When I said I would not like to do it at this time but would like a regular cleaning they said I still had to pay $300 because it's not covered by insurance. Liar! My insurance does cover general cleaning. So after waiting 2 hours, I left without the cleaning that I came in for. Waste of time. They won't perform any services unless they can get more money out of you.

This is my second time here and I will never come here again. They have no clue on customer service and over book their clients each time.
We waited over 2.5 hours for just cleaning and didn’t perform any work. Ruined our Saturday.
Worst dental place for kids...😡</Review>

My kids use to go to magic land dental that place was better than this place dental associates of torrance they just got lucky and got a place in torrance I guess. The girls at the front desk are nice.but the place doent seem busy we have gone three times I dont know if it's the times I've gone or what but we have spent 2 -3 hours in the office  each time and again the office did was not busy when we walked in there was nobody even in the waiting room and we didnt even get no major work 2 fillings and the dentist lady was rough and the other time I sat in the back room to be seen and that took 15mins and people were passing nobody came by to tell me nothing if they were coming -sorry for the wait she almost done no information yes my falt for not speaking up and asking what the heck is going on but I dont think I will be going back to that office i know it's not a big deal but they lost a customer.< /review>

<Text>After dealing with the dental office assigned to me by my insurance, I was extremely happy that I came to this dental office. My drive went from  a short 4 minute drive to a 40 minute drive, in regular traffic, but it was well worth it. The other office did not care about the pain I was in. That can't be farther from the truth here. I have very sensitive teeth and they always make sure I am fully numb. I admit I am a baby when it comes to dental work. They are so warm, yet profesional and always tell me up front what my coats are and give me options for treatment and payment. I highly recommend coming to this office. Dr. Audi is very kind and professional. She did abreast job on my bridge. Yolly was very patient and put up with so much from me.  All the staff is great.</Text>< GmapID>

Horrible place. My mother went in for x-rays, exam, and cleaning. She showed up at 9:45am for a 10am appointment. She didn't get taken until 11. They did the x-rays. She then sat for another hour waiting for the dentist before she finally had to get up and walk out because she had other appointments for the day she needed to get to.< /review>

<Text>First off it was a bad impression my son went in to have a bad tooth pulled and came out owing $2,500 through Dental Alliance, my son has a learning disability and they just pushed him through all of it. Never did pull his tooth. We're now receiving a bill for $71 which includes the 28.48% interest rate. We went in today to out and end to this. An hour and 15 minutes went by and we were now told that we still had to pay $600 for The Impressions that were made but they would refund us the other money. I had to do a lot of rraising my voice, demanding and standing up for the situation refusing to accept it and in the end, the wonderful regional manager "Christina" did the right thing and zeroed out the charges.  Also, the Dentist, can't remember how to spell her name she was absolutely wonderful too!
I am now planning on going in to have work done on my mouth.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I have been going to them since a child but lately I have had horrible experiences with them. They have been rude, insulting me more than once and refused to give me access to my dental records. After I requested them for the 3rd time I was told they were destroyed and they only have digital copies going back to 5 years. Not to mention... last time I went and had dental work done they gave me something I was allergic to and refused to give me the name of that drug. They don't value their customers they are just money hungry!!!<//Text>< pictures>

<username>Shilea Johnson</username><time>1403553181806< /time><rating>1<//rating><Text>I was scheduled for a Deep Cleaning appointment two months in advance. I have two jobs and a family therefore arranging a day off for this appointment was very complicated but I managed it. The day before my appointment in the late afternoon a message was left on my home phone (opposed to my work or cell number) stating my appointment had been cancelled and I needed to call and reschedule. I contacted Gina (Supervisor) and Gina advised me that my appointment was cancelled because their records showed that I needed another exam prior to proceeding with the final of my four Dental Cleanings. Gina stated that an exam is required every 6 months, however my third cleaning was after the 6 month requirement and I was never advised. I ask Gina since my appointment was at 11am if I could come in prior to that time for the exam. Gina very rudely said "no it has already been cancelled &  she would reschedule me for then end of the following month" this was not acceptable since I was not informed of their policy for exams and my appointment was cancelled prior to leaving me the message within 24 hours of my appointment time. Gina's reply and solution was "Lady since this appears to not be working for you I am going to contact your Insurance Company and send a fax to them removing you from our patient log and you can then go elsewhere".  I was in shock during the entire conversation. This was unprofessional, un-concerned and rude. Gina did not accept any responsibility in this matter.  When I first joined Dental Associates of Torrance it was based upon a referral and it was great however the customer service is now awful. This is the second time an appointment was cancelled the first time my appointment was on a Saturday and I was advised that policy had changed and only certain type of appointments were allowed to be scheduled on a Saturday. (I re-arranged a vacation to keep this appointment-that was cancelled within 24 hours of my scheduled appointment)   I was advised of the change in customer service by others who have left Dental Associates of Torrance  but I assumed their story's were exaggerated.  Dental Associates of Torrance should realize that people with insurance have a choice and their employees are paid by those choices.</Text>< pics>

He gave me options and left. I asked the tech was that the. Dr and she said yes so I told her I wasn't sure since he said nothing but to open my mouth.  She said they were really busy so I guess he was rushed.  I'd come back because everyone has a bad day. The facility seem very clean and bright.

I called DA of Torrance back to confirm and she said that my appointment is for 3pm and i said no i made it for 2pm. I have proof from the text and voicemail they sent me. So she said she will change it. Werid!
When i arrived for my appointment i had to wait 45mins to take X-rays. Then waited in the waiting room for a chair to open up. After a hour and 40 mins from the time i arrived i was sent to an open station. I was seen by a male nurse to measured my gums. He was nice and very clear on what he was doing with me and what i had.
After two hours and thirty mins from the time i arrived i saw the dentists. She only came to tell me what she suggest i needed. She was with me for a about 10mins.
Then i had to wait for another lady to tell me how much it will cost me. I informed her i have two insurance. One I’m on my husband and one i have from myself. So she said she will have her girls to call me back on the prices on Monday.
At that point, I’ve been at the DA OF Torrance for 3 hours and 30 mins without getting any cleaning or anything fix.
I feel like i wasted my time. To top it all off i was scared the whole week because I’m afraid of the dentists.
Over all the staff is nice but didn’t keep me inform how long it was going to take.
I will not return or give Dental Associate of Torrance my business.
Thank you.</Review><Response>None<//Response>< rating>

< Review>
I was quite apprehensive not being sure the goal of having a heslthy mouth ahain was wirth the imagined pain. I normally am not very determind to do what is the right thing. Anyway the technicians and staff help me be brave enough.Congenial, encouraging words from those involved made me feel safe and alright. So thank you ( My memory of names isn't good) I really appreciate your professional methodology? Thank you all.<//Review>

<Review>Shady ethics and questionable business practices:

A month before oral surgery, I received a request for additional information on the procedure planned from my insurance. I called the office and asked about it, and they said they would handle it. Instead, they waited until the day OF the procedure to send the additional information out by regular post mail, thus forcing me to pay out of pocket for the procedure.

It's been a month since the procedure took place and I've called several times to follow up on the process of my claim and coverage reimbursement, but so far I've left 3 messages and received no updates. Very unprofessional and outright shady practice for them to have pulled this kind of move. Find an office with better ethics and business practices.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Do not come to this place. .they make you wait for hours once you don't get there upgrades, which includes giving them more money, they treat you rude...until you walk out...if you go and you have dental insurance make sure you bring your coverage prices..because they will lie about the prices..by $200.00 or  more. .stay away< /review>

<Review>Everyone is nice and friendly, they make you feel welcome. And I believe the floor manager by the name of Carlos Espados really nice and freindly.also the two tech Liasa Make And Sonia santillan makes you confertable and the are kind. Most of all Dr. AMAL AUDI a wonderful person and verey very freindly and she listened when you talk to her. But a week after when I went the 2nd time on July 3rd 2017 there was anoother substitue female dr. with sun glasses  doesnt want to hear what I was saying. Before she talked to me she just wrote prescripition which I refused to take and left the clinic. If I know her name defenately I.....Plus if i know someone who want to go to your clinic I will tell him not to see her</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This dental is the worst dental that I have been at. They don't help you. If you make an appointment it takes 4 hours just to be seen and when it was my turn they wanted $1000.00 extra..when I said no.. they were rude and kept me sitting for more hours. Stay away..<//Review>

Had to wait 4hrs, made appointment weeks in advance.  What is the point of making a reservations when you have to wait 4 hrs!!!  They need to learn how to schedule patients, very rude, not even sorry for making our whole family wait without any updates, gonna change offices.  I would never recommend this office to anyone!!!<//text>

Not impressed , arrived at 3:40 , filled out the forms , they called my daughter back , after waiting hour I texted her , she responded , “they haven’t done my cleaning  yet , “ I asked to go back with her , they took me back , we waited 25 min more before my face must have scared them 😩finally a girl came and said are you still waiting , let’s see , ok you are next for cleaning , then they said no cleaning she needs deep cleaning and they need approval . Then she gave me the prices for crown , not cheaper then my Dentist  on the hill , This place feels like assembly line . Two and half hours wasted !!! When I asked for the X-ray she said she could only give me a paper copy , so like I said waste of time !!! Unless you have no choice ,( they take Medical )<//review>
