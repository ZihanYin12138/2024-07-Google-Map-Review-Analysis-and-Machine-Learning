Amazing breakfast spot!
Ordered the Java combo with Waffle. Everything tasted great, their house potatoes are quite good, the atmosphere is cozy yet refreshing all with a small cafe vibe. Really enjoyed eating here and the prices are on par with other dinner chains. Why not rather support a family owned business where the owner takes pride in his food and restaurant.< /text>

The food is always tasty, correct, and is some of the most well-packed takeout I have ever experienced.  My SO and I especially love that he can get breakfast style dishes all day, while I get more savory lunch and dinner options.  Thank you Jumpin Java for the obvious care and attention you put into your dishes and your service!<//Review>< rating>

We like a lot eating out. Last night we  found this delicious place which friends told us about. We passed a beautiful evening there with delicious dishes and a well-trained crew and  a professional chief cook. We  added this venue in our phone list  and we will definitely go again very soon. We warmly recommend.< /Text>

I was complaining a bit at the price which was 38 for two cheeseburgers and fries but oh my... this is honestly the best burger I have had ever!!!!  Or a close equal to True Burger in Sherman Oaks, CA . I do not like fancy burgers and even though they have fancy burgers and an appearance of a tall height burger.. the taste is perfect! The meat was cooked to perfection, slightly pink inside and not dried out. The scampi fries smelled and tasted amazing although I probably didn't smell so good after eating some as they are loaded full of garlic, chili flakes and lemon. This place is very small, no seats inside and it appears people order burgers and eat at the bar next door. They have a couple small tables outside which I sat at. Great place if you are craving a really good burger!

Today I heard was “ National Blueberry Pancake Day” so I started the day at Jumpin Java for Breakfast🍎!

I’ve been there a lot in the last 20 years living in my Studio City neighborhood.
It’s truly the best breakfast.. what a menu with an entire page of pancakes (even a recent carrot cake variety)!
I hadn’t tried the pancakes until this banner day.!
They are huge; I couldn’t finish the half order of 2. Real butter & maple syrup.

They have daily specials . Best BLT
Around with sides of fresh fruit or these special spiced potatoes!
And the sausage side is so good whether pork or turkey.

I’ve tried pasta specials for lunch with a very veggie green salad.
Their home brewed coffee is amazing and served in new white ceramic vintage mugs.
The service is impeccable. I usually get Johnny who is so nice; but the whole staff is accommodating.

They are only open until about 3 for breakfast or lunch however they open early.
5 Stars every day pancake holiday or Not👍✅< /text>

Geeeted with a smile and got a seat right away. Food was really good. We had the breakfast burrito with bacon which comes with a side of salsa. The salsa was put the burrito over the top. And we got the French toast sandwich - yum. It wasnt overly sweet, which is the way I like it. Friendly staff too< /review>

I made this account specifically to write this review and maybe more down the line. The Manager here should be fired! Food is great. But please, whoever owns this joint needs to find a new Manager. I have never been treated so rudely and with such disrespect by a fellow human being in my life. I explained to the guy that the potatoes can not go on top of a waffle. The sauce and spice they cook the potatoes in soak into waffle. Rendering the my Belgium Waffle experience less than satisfying. I asked the Manager if he would make a new waffle or compensate me in some way...After all I have ordered here numerous time. He told me he would give me $2 then lectured me how I need to tell them not to put potatoes on the my Belgium Waffle. I explained kindly how down the line other customers should not have to go through the same thing as I did. That an easy fix would be to put them in a separate containers. He argued with me for no reason, and said to me, "Do you want the $2 or not". I wanted to tell him he can take his $2 and shove it where the sun don't shine, but instead I said "If this was my restaurant I would just comp the whole thing" in which he replied "I'll give you 50% off" and then immediately hung up on me. I did not want to write this review, but I feel as if there are far too many people looking for good work like a Manger position. This guy certainly does not deserve it. Maybe he was having a bad day, and I'll see a response here, but I doubt it. Good food though :)< /text>

Great little bunch spot in the Valley. Good food and tasty coffee. A very local vibe that is nice for writers wanting to escape the need for Starbucks and a low key spot to eat with friends on the weekend. Can't wait to try their pancakes next!! The group eating next so me seemed to love them!!</text>

<text>One of my favorite breakfast places. A really good selection of pancakes that are all really good. It's a hard choice between the breakfast lavash sandwich and pancakes. Never had lunch here, this review is breakfast only.</text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
95% of the time . . . . I often eat out, no restaurant is perfect! . . . . I eat breakfast/brunch at Jumpin Java most weekends, the wait is usually no more than 10-15min, the owner/s and  staff, most have worked there for years, are quite friendly-not solicitous, when I remember I call ahead and ask to be put on the waiting list, then when I arrived there's hardly a wait. The menu has a nice variety of choices, the food is fresh and served hot. And their prices are quite reasonable. If they do make a mistake, they rectify it with no attitude. FIVE STARS!!!!< /review>

This is definitely the most convenient and well preeminent pawn shop I’ve been to without a doubt. They’re very welcoming and as a Security Shift Supervisor in the corporate customer service field/area, they are on top of it! Sonny is the guy you want to talk to or inquire to if you come and I’m saying that because of my visit. If I was to come again and speak to someone else, I’m sure they would definitely be more than happy to help and assist. Top of the line y’all!!<//Text>

<text>Just sold some beautiful gold pieces to Yev's. Sonny is not like your average pawn/jewellery shop dealer. He is very friendly and doesn't bs when it comes to price points. He paid me a respectable and fair market price for my items. I was very pleased with my experience at Yev's.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>This is by far the best pawn shop in LA. I must have went to 4 different locations before making the deal. Not only was the customer service personable and honest. They also were very generous in pricing with high quality products for sale. If your in the Los Angeles area and looking to loan or purchase a new piece of jewelry look no further. Sincerely, Vivienne.<//review>< Resp>

I spent 6 hours and went to more than 7 places looking for a better price than Yev offered me. Had to come back and admit that he was right and that he offered me a good $for each item just like he said. Dont waste your time people like I did. You definitely can trust this place. Everything went smooth, fast and easy after we settled the deal.<//Text>< pictures>

I had to write a second review on Google because I felt that Yev's deserves two great reviews.

I was in a very dire situation and needed to sell my old HP touch smart computer. I wasn't expecting much, since last time I went to a pawn shop I only got a small amount for my Mac.

So when I called and spoke to Sonny on the phone I was a bit nervous. He explained to me that I would not get as much as I did for the Mac at any of the pawn shops. However after taking a look, Sonny was willing to take a risk and give me double what I would have normally gotten for an HP 15 Touch-smart!

I've had a wonderful experience and would totally recommend! The place is also very clean, and the guys are really chill, and really care. :)

Thanks again guys! ;) You helped me a lot!</Text>

This place was one of the most professional and knowledgeable places I have ever dealt with in this industry.  They are no the typical loan or pawnshop you go to.  They actual go the extra mile for the customer and pay a lot more than other location in the area.  Don't hesitate to call or ask them questions about anything, they will do their best to work with you.<//review>

No one wishes upon themselves to be in such a need that they have to pawn something, but if you ever do, Yev’s Jewerly & Loan is the place. The guys will take care of you to the best of their ability and treat you fairly with respect. From someone that’s used them multiple times, i advise you to stop by and give them a try.< /text>

No pressure cooker environment, Yev and his employees make you feel at ease and comfortable with the process - and if either side can't work out a deal, no sweat.

I went in to pawn a couple gold rings.  The owner weighed them and told me he would give me $160 for them, right before I left he offered $180. I didn’t take the offer. I went directly across the street and the guys at the shop weighed them, looked up the current price for gold and offered me 80% off the value. I left there with $275.  That’s $95 more than what the would give me at Yev’s!  Don’t pawn your valuables here. Always get a second  appraisal.<//Review>

Ok let's face it with the economy up & down, $ gets tight and I have had to visit this Shop about 10 times over the last 3 years, I have gotten to meet the owner who has always worked with me and been more than fair, and allowed me to get loans against my property when needed then pay back and get my things back.  I highly recommend this shop, and I will continue to use them when I need a quick loan.</Text>

This isn't your typical pawnshop. They're honest, treat you with respect no matter what you bring in, and pay the most!</Text>

of what I find interesting. In the past twenty-five years I must have visited over 150 Jewelry, Loan and Pawn shops in various states around the US and vintage boutiques in Europe.
From my first experience with the owner Yev Goldman and his entire staff, I have never been treated with a level of service which one would expect buying a 18k Gold Minute Repeater at the Vacheron Constantin Boutique on Rodeo or a 18K White Gold Paul Newman Daytona.
To call Yev's Jewelry & Loan a pawn shop, would belittle the boutique and the dedicated hard working staff. I have done both, purchased watches at a very fair price and loaned watches or other pieces in order to have immediate access to cash, if  exceptionally good deal on a watch or  collectors item was needed within hours. They have given me the opportunity to expand my collection at the best interest rates I have ever experienced. Most important is their integrity, they have educated me on pieces I overpaid and gave me advice not to purchase pieces that wouldn't hold value. I have never had a Jewelry or Watch store tell me that if I am buying a certain piece to re-sell at later time for a profit, not to do so, unless I truly liked the piece for myself and would keep it in my collection. Some of the Fancy Jewelry Stores in Beverly Hills that sell pre-owned refurbished watches or even new ones, should spend a day at Yev's to learn hospitality, service and most of all integrity.

<Text>Yev is the man ! I pawned my AP, mind you this is the first time I was in a jam like this. As I was walking out of the first pawnshop scratching my head thinking why they don't take this type of watch. In my home country they are very sought after. Long story short pawn shops in Los Angele's only take Rolex and Audemars Piguet is a brand they look at like it's something that fell of a space ship. Thankfully I found Yev's Jewelry on Google and the rest went like this "Cha-Ching". I some cash and paid my bills. Thank You Yev and staff you guys are good people.  I will be back soon to pick her up ))< /Text>< user_name>

Smells horrible. You can even smell it outside. The food here was bland . Came here because of the good reviews and pics .. the beans looked flavorful but wasn’t really any flavor wasn’t as expected. I love authentic Mexican food but this isn’t it .< /Review>

Came here for the reviews. I was not disappointed I got the 3 taco plate with refried beans and rice and it was probably the best I have had in the bay area. I have tried close to 50 restaurants and trucks in the bay. The service is not that good. I couldn't get the waiter to refill my cup of water no matter what I tried. He just seemed more content on cleaning tables and talking to guests, than tending to the only table that was currently eating which was just me. Other than that go here for authentic Mexican food. I ordered pastor tacos which were cooked perfect with a bit of crispy and tons of flavor. Will definitely be coming back to eat on the regular. I just know next time to not pay first so I can decide if I want to tip.<//text>

<text>My favorite local taqueria. Delicious food with fast, friendly service and reasonable prices. My favorite dish is their carnitas dinner (under the tropical platters section). Their sopes are really good, too. The Chile relleno was OK, but a bit bland the time I had it. Everything else has been fantastic.<//text><UserId.>109864116180646138312<//UserId.>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Update only to say we keep coming back here and are always happy that we did  this place is outstanding!

I just love this place! From the high quality of the seafood and the size of the portions to the staff who work there.

Not so easy to see from the street to keep aware but it does have a parking lot shared with a couple of other stores in the strip, I've seen it quite full but haven't had a problem finding a spot to park.

Look to the walls for pictures from the menu, I like choosing by look so I try new things. One of the new things is their Nachos Marinos, my favorite and what I have every other time I am there.

My father, who really appreciates hot good, ordered a dish and asked for hot - the waiter warned us that it would be hot - and it was. My father loved every minute of it! Said it was a proper hot and that it started warm but built as he ate. My dad can be picky and he was happy, I expect he'll be visiting on his own.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
I always come here for the taco special plate. It comes with 3 tacos (meat,onions,cilantro,salsa) with rice and beans for REAL cheap! But it's how good their food is that keeps this place in business while others have come and gone. There are a LOT of choices in this area for food, but Mar Y Tierra is easily one of the best around the East Bay.<//Review>

Food and atmosphere were excellent, portions were worth the price. You can order take out or dine in, the only thing was the horchata, was not made from milk.</Review>

<text>Fantastic Mexican food and absolutely the best carnitas that I have ever had! We went here on a whim and it completely exceeded our expectations. I’m also a little snobbish about salsa and their salsa and pico were superb. Just writing this review is setting my tastebuds off!

Was driving Uber in Hayward and decided to find the nearest Taqueria to get a veggie burrito. Checked out their website which listed the burrito for $6.50. Went to the restaurant. The owner came up with a total of $9.31. Asked him how much the burrito was. He replied $8.50. Told him their website listed $6.50. He said he doesn't use the website but do need to update it.</text>

Iv been eating here since they day they opened. Iv had almost everything on the menu there is not a single bad dish. A few of my favorites are the #4 especial 3 tacos and the #11 pechuga flameada and let’s not forget the #8 wet burrito the enchilada sauce is to die for. I eat here 3 times a week for sure. Keep up the good work folks I’ll see you soon<//Text>

All meats are cooked perfect. That makes for a good mexican restaurant. Used to be in RWC on Broadway, now I travel from Sunnyvale to Hayward to eat there. Maybe some of the folks with bad review just do t have the taste of ones who like it so well.. Not all restaurants can satisfy every patron. All eaterys have some kind complaints. Wont stop me from.going.<//Text>

For many years I've gone to this place 2-3 times a week and most of the time I would pick up 3-4 order for co workers... Under the new management it dropped from my favorite places to eat! Customer service not polite, specially the man waiter..food not so great below average for me..over priced compare to previous owner prices. No I'm not coming again..<//Text>

This is the spot to go and have a quiet and affordable meal. You will barely be able to suck your tummy in lol. My favorite is there Carne Asada plate well done or their super burritos 😋 Chorizo tacos are spicy, but goooood!!!< /text>

< review>
Love Love Love this spot. My boyfriend and I eat here all the time, prices are great portions are great, service is great. There have been times when we went 2ce in one day. I love the al pastor, grilled chicken and the shrimp tostadas(for the low tho) they also have really fat shrimp plates. I like the garlic shrimp, but you have to peel the shells. The diablo shrimp come peeled already.  Oh the chips and salsa smack hard as well. I’ve never had a bad experience here<//review>

<text>This food is BOMB! Man, you have no idea how excited I was to bump into this place coming from out of town (Fresno). The food is so flavorful and delicious! I got the tostada de camaron and it was DELICIOUS! My husband got the super quesadilla de asada and i ate half and it was delicious. Not greasy like other places. My son had the asada tacos and the meat is in big chunks and very well seasoned. Definitely hitting this place up everytime I am in town. Must go! They also have great customer service amd when I got my food to go, they gave us chips and salsa. Also, the prices are super cheap. Made me feel skeptical at first like they were going to skimp out on my food lol 😂😂. Not the case.<//text>< resp>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) With all due respect but it was not my taste the toast of ceviche that I ordered one because they had cream or mayonnaise I do not know why it did not taste the ceviche and another that everything was super chopped as if they wanted to save the vegetables and the seafood hahaha I turned my stomach also a life wing in glass that was cocktail type haha ​​omg pure onion did not think anything of flavor about two shrimps, one or two oysters and 5 pieces of octopus jiji had no red tomato or anything simply onion and coriander exaggeratedly chopped that seemed not to be pure water with onion and some seafood, but I understand that tastes are broken genres and I can not say that all this bad is simply the worst thing eaten so far, I hope the owner can be aware of what what they serve and how they serve it ....

(Original)
Con todo respeto pero no fue de mi gusto las tostadas de ceviche que pedí una porque tenían crema o mayonesa no se otra por que no tenía ni sabor el ceviche y otra que todo estaba súper picado como si quisieran ahorrarse los vegetales y el marisco jajaja se me revolvió mi estómago también un vuelve ala vida en vaso que era tipo cóctel jaja omg pura cebolla no lo creía nada de sabor unos dos camaroncitos,uno o dos ostiones y 5 pedazos de pulpo jiji no tenía tomate rojo ni nada simplemente cebolla y cilantro exageradamente picado que igual parecía no se pura agua con cebolla y algunos mariscos,pero yo comprendo que en gustos se rompen géneros y no puedo decir que todo este mal simplemente es lo peor que e comido hasta ahora,ojalá el dueño pueda estar al tanto de lo que sirven y como lo sirven....< /Text>< pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) Well the truth ... yesterday I went with my boyfriend and we asked for shrimp and fish broth and it was horrible, the vegetables looked like toys, one thing I couldn't chew, it seemed that they had already been cooked since. For me ... This restaurant does not deserve a star, they lack much for that .... with much respect

Pues la verdad ...ayer fui con mi novio y pedimos caldo de camarónes y de pescado y estaba horrible, las verduras parecian de juguete , una cosa me no se podía masticar, pareciera ke ya las tenian cocinadas asaber desde  cuando.

OMG! Yes, it's that good.  The flavors exceeded my expectations on every dish. Look at pics for examples.  Santa Rosa please step up and support this new business, you won't be disappointed. Needless to say I will return again.  This is not mall food, it's serious dining for those who love Mediterranean food it's a must visit location.<//text>

Amazing , authentic Turkish inspired Mediterranean restaurant. I got a delicious beef skewer which was very tender and delicious. I highly recommend if you would like to taste high quality kebabs and desserts.< /review>

The service was fantastic and the food was equally so. I adore the staff and for the past three days I have always left in a better mood than when I came in. I always leave with a smile and a full stomach. I highly recommend ordering the Turkish orange soda water, It’s the perfect drink. If I’m ever in California again I’ll be sure to make a stop in Santa Rosa so I can have this wonderful experience again. The appreciation I have for the food and staff is hard to put into words but to sum up my experiences here with one word I would say “perfect”.</review>< Pictures>

<review>There's a reason for all the good reviews. This place is excellent. We got lost trying to find it and when we walked up we were a little disappointed to see that it's a very casual order at the counter restaurant. We decided to take our chances anyway and we were glad that we did. The food is really top-notch. The chicken kabobs were extremely tender and flavorful. The hummus is very good also. The pita bread incredibly soft. The rice was perfectly done. As was the salad. There are pickled vegetables on the salad which I loved. Service was fantastic too. All in all this place is a winner.< /review>< user_id>

Been there twice and have had a pleasant experience both times. The staff is friendly and the food is fresh and delicious. I’ve tried the Kebab platters and the meat is so tender and juicy. Definitely recommend this place.</text>

<Review>I was not happy with my falafel roll up. It was pretty plain and not exciting— just falafel, tahini, spinach, bread and one slice of red pepper— but it came with tons of pickles which I found disgusting. Even if you don’t dislike them, pickles are not a standard feature on a falafel roll up so it just doesn’t make sense. Disappointed.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great place like all the Jamba Juices, but crowded during peak hours, and the wait can be as long at 20 minutes!!! The peach smoothies and berry blast are my favorite ones. The bowl is great too.< /Text>< Pictures>

This is my favorite lemonade ever! The jasmine Palmer is AMAZING!!! If you're going to treat yourself to quality drink, it should be this one. The owner, Victor, has such a kind heart and you can tell he is passionate about his business.<//Review>

<name>Michelle Chan<//name><Text>Long wait times, but where else are you going to go?

Came on a warm Saturday afternoon and the place was jam packed. There was one cashier and one person making the smoothies. I don't know why the cashier never helped out the person making the smoothies - it would have made the wait time a whole lot faster, but somehow she would conveniently disappear after she took everyone's orders. Smoothie was fine, no big mess up there. I wouldn't recommend the new watermelon flavor though - it had no watermelon taste to it whatsoever.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<text>I grow my own wheat grass and the juice should be med-to dark green with a little froth, the wheat grass I returned was very clear like it was half water it seemed.  It was also the 5$ double shot and was filled almost up to 3/4.  The girl was nice, but when I returned the grass, she gave me a small instead of a large, forgot a substitution (pineapple for mango) and then when i showed the recept, she just filled the rest with juice making it watery consistency.  It was on a college campus and hard to find, maybe this is why quality here suffers.< /text>< Pictures>

(old review, be sure to read edit at the end)

Got my septum pierced here a few days ago, only on like day 3 of having it. I noticed the dude that pierced me did it super crooked, i’ve tried fixing it with no luck. Only reason why this isn’t a 1 star is because the guys we met were really nice and because you can’t really tell it’s crooked unless you look into my nose. If you wanna get pierced here, ask for a mirror to ensure they’re placing it correctly.

Edit: My piercing is much straighter now. It seemed more crooked than it was due to swelling. Scroll to last photo to see most recent.<//text>

A girlfriend and I read reviews & picked this place & were not disappointed. We were immediately greeted by Jeff as we walked in, had no appointment and were able to fill in for a missed appointment. Jeff was nice & professional, made us feel very welcome & comfortable. This was not my first tattoo but is the smallest and if they are able to make something small with detail, they can pull anything off. Jeff did not disappoint!!</review>

<Text>This is an awesome place to get your next tattoo.  Very warm, friendly service.  No attitudes.  Reasonable prices for inking and great conversation while it's all getting done.

I didn't think I wanted another tattoo, but am definitely thinking of getting another one because I enjoyed my experience there so much!< /Text>< user_id>

This is the best shop I've been tattooed at. The artist did an amazing custom work all drawn by hand!  He did last minute changes with no complaint. He was more than happy to take my ideas and did amazing. From beginning to end it was all smooth tattooing. He made sure to take breaks and detailed my design.  The shop is super clean and the atmosphere is super comfortable. I highly recommend this shop<//review>

I never leave reviews but had THE BEST experience with Black and Blue. Everyone at the shop is incredibly nice, helpful, and informative. Even better, the artists working there are all diverse and extremely talented.

I worked with Maggie on a custom tattoo. She did a phenomenal job and I couldn't be happier with the end result. She's an extremely talented artist!!<//Text>

I got my tattoo from Juliet and she was so sweet and gentle the entire time. My tattoo was supposed to be two sessions but she knocked it out in one. She is so professional and she will respond so quickly to all your emails. It was my first tattoo and it was such a great experience. I recommend 11/10</text>

Gordon is the man. Amazing line work. My new tattoo is better than I could have imagined, and he even cleaned up an older tattoo on my wrist.
Can't recommend this place or Gordon enough.< /Review>

Had an awesome experience with Gabriel. Not only did he respond promptly and was super helpful but he also does great work. I spent about about an hour and a half there total with meeting, chatting, and the getting actual work. The dude is a pro and to quote Kanye, he has dragon energy. Can't wait to go back.<//Text>

<review>My tattoo experience in LA has been mostly awful. One Way Tattoo Shop feels like an oasis amongst a desert of terrible shops and rude artists. I've gotten 2 tattoos here and both times the experience has been incredible. This last time my tattoo was done by Dan Dunbar, a real class act. If you're looking for professional and friendly tattoo artists, look no further.</review></record></dataset><record>

Just had my first tattoo this afternoon with Andrey and could not say enough great things about this place. The amount of gratitude from every person there towards their customers is felt from the moment you walk in. Pricing is fair and for the service provided makes you want to take care of them as well. I will be back.< /review>

Just got my tattoo done here on my arm.  I think his name was Luis.  Very professional and great customer service- no vague or curt answers like many other shops when you ask questions about size/ pricing etc.  I felt very welcome and would recommend.<//Review>

<Review>I did my nose pierced in Korea and it fall out so I had to find a local shop. The guy who did my nose was really kind and nice and it didn’t hurt that much, also the shop looked clean and the preparing stuff was clean too. I recommend this shop.<//Review>< rating>

<Review>Went in on Wednesday to see Bud get a tattoo fixed. It looked so good that I asked him to touch up the other older tattoo. I thought with age, it would be the most painful tattoo but I swear it was almost painless. See Bud if you're in the area and if you're a wimp like me!< /Review>< pictures>

Went in today with my mom to get matching barbell ear piercings and man, what an experience! Mario was amazing and very professional. He made sure everything was nice and clean and completely sterilized. Thanks Mario! Also, Luis really helped make my mom feel comfortable about planning out with her a design for her first ever tattoo. She's so excited about coming back and so am I! Definitely recommend this shop to anyone looking for professional work and top class customer service 😊</Review>

<text>After searching through many shops I finally decided on this one. I had my tattoo done by Roger. He was very nice and easy to talk to. He listened to what I said and created a piece that was way better than anything I could have imagined. Overall I had a great experience and I will definitely be going back. Roger was very skilled and executed my piece flawlessly.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rating>

I went here last Monday to get an ear piercing but nobody acknowledged me. I went inside the shop and said hi but the lady ignored me and was conversing with 2 other people about how terrified she is about the ocean. I was hoping that she would tell me to wait or something like that but she never said anything or even looked at me and I was standing there for 5 minutes. I decided to just leave since the lady was not interested.</Review>

I was low key nervous about trying out a new artist, but stumbling upon this shop was a great find. Lil did a dope piece of art for me... and looking through her books, shes suuuuper talented. She took my vision, made it better, and she paid great attention to details. The other guys in the shop were pretty dope too. I went in with two other friends and besides new ink, we overall just had a good time. Laughing and chatting with the crew. If Im ever back in L.A. I wouldnt hesitate to let them add more art. Highlyrecommended.<//Review>

<text>There is a lot of cool stuff here. The main thing bring their pearls of course. It's cool how they open the oysters and pull the pearl out in front of you. They have the option to make the pearls into jewelry or you can buy some they already have made. The staff was really friendly and knew what they were doing.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>We picked an oyster for $11.50, got lucky and there was a giant black pearl inside worth almost $200! We ended up spending over $200 to have it set and get matching pearl earrings. Cool experience, great marketing on their part! If you love pearls this was a really neat experience and a highly recommend it.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>So this evening I went in looking at necklaces for my wedding day.  When the guy working at the store finally acknowledged me after several minutes of browsing I asked about the price of specific piece and whether or not they made it in silver instead of yellow gold. He then looked me up and down and said that the piece would never fit me because the chain was too small and it was made to be worn by someone dainty. He pulled the piece out and proceeded to try and put it on me to prove that it wouldn't fit, I respectfully declined trying it on and I repeated my questions. I never requested to try anything on and I never thought in my life someone would tell me I am too fat to wear a necklace. Extremely disappointed in the service and will choose to not buy here if the same gentleman is working.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I came to Redondo Beach.
Mie Pearl Jewelry is a famous jewelry store on this beach.
I had visited Shima's Mikimoto Pearl store before,
I was surprised by the brightness of the pearls.
I decided to visit that impression again this time.
The pearls here are certainly brilliant, but at last
You can't go beyond that impression of Pari Shima.
But at the end I didn't buy anything.
I'm sorry.

(Original)
レドンドビーチにやって来た。
Mie Pearl Jewelryはこのビーチで有名な宝石店。
以前志摩のミキモトパール店を訪れたことがありその時の
真珠の輝きに驚かされた。
今回も又あの感動をと訪問してみることにした。
ここの真珠も確かに素晴らしい輝きを放っているが、やっ
ぱり志摩のあの感動を越えることは出来ない。
でも最後は何も購入しませんでした。
御免なさい。<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnPQos63Zz2kCSOetPzeghK4uJuWwLNhO7snzj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJ2hjJc-MA97VbGlgxN82gKKFe8iQ4JDjt6Twg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSaYGRG9roChqhHJwMGRTuNS1kDaMK-PBlcflc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMNy-qMwkYkC0-BpgdC6hQ6fBVFyuKM55q7Cf7O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6ORrOyuS07cEHduaY7fx2nR59rhgdpZZYUoIl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPW3druyRCCxjUZs1BA3ifyTxBVPSTMBGZar0x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvncVsKrD71uaNPX8oDY2tt4NVK7g4LDXSD4rL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) A unique experience, you pay $ 12 and choose an oyster, they all have pearls inside! I grabbed pear pearl valued at $ 80, my friend grabbed 2, right there they give you the service of putting them on earrings, chains .. at the end I took home a necklace with my dark pearl valued at $ 120 .. I loved it!

This place has the most amazing food. I like it because there is a large variety and everything is cooked amazingly well. The salsa is superb and the tortillas are homemade and delicious! We try and eat there at least once a week.</Text>

Major point loss, I ordered a Burrito and for the time it took it should’ve came out better. For the little-meat it contained, it was in large chunks, Everything was cluttered up in layers, every bite was either a ball of Meat, Rice, or sour Cream, it was Fairly cold and upon paying I saw they were using a microwave to heat up food. I used to love this place, but overtime it’s lost it’s enthusiastic touch and Originality. If there were a no star option, this restaurant would deserve that rating, one star would be false advertisement.<//text>

Great food! And they do tacos for a dollar on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I fed my whole family of five with $25. Can't beat that.</text>

The staff was super rude. An employee was taking a personal phone call while I was eating my dinner. She was loud and obnoxious.  As I was paying,  I told the cashier my observations and the woman on the phone got defensive and told me she was on her break and could talk to whoever she wanted.  I explained that I didn't want to hear her personal conversation while I was having my dinner. The food was good but this experience ruined it.<//text>

All the Spanish you need to know is this," trees tacos de asada con todo, con salsa Verde, para a key for favor. Three tacos of grilled beef with lettuce, cilantro, onion topped with a savory mild green Chile salsa to be eaten here please. Trust me you will be back for more and for other stuff. This place is a Coalinga treasure!< /Text>

<rating>3</rating><Review>This playground is great for kids 3 and under. It's okay for kids older than that. The main equipment is basically one long, elevated platform with little "towers" every 30 ft or so that get progressively higher off the ground with a covered slide at the end. Each tower has different ways to climb up/down it like rope ladders, poles, etc. There is a semi-circle device that is basically a modern version of a teeter totter and probably was once pretty great, but it's so weathered and worn that there is too much friction for it to be much fun for any kid under about 10 (and how many kids that age come here?!). There is a zip line, though it's the sanitized version where it's on a metal track and very short with hardly any elevation change so pretty lackluster. There are toddler/baby swings as well as 2 regular swings and a merry-go-round with rope tower; all pretty standard playground stiff. There is a little climbing wall that uses actual faux rock instead of holds, but I have no idea who the target audience is because it's way too hard for any kid who would be of the age that they would be coming to this program.

Finally, this playground has an interesting vibe because it's buried behind houses and hence removed from a road which makes it somewhat peaceful. It's also basically built into the side of a steep hill, so one side effectively has a wall of earth (with lots of plants and stairs up to the Rec Center).

Overall, this is a pretty average park in a neighborhood, St. Mary's Park, that not many people visit or know about, so worth  checking out if you're not from the immediate area as a way to try a new playground with the kids.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Text>I love this playground. So do my kids. It's a little worn but the equipment in it is top notch fun. It’s huge and it has a large metal tube slide to offer express access to the lower level. Basketball and tennis courts and like most city parks, you may reserve part of it for birthdays and events. My kids ask to go here by name.< /Text>< response>

I walk through here every day with my dog.  Rec and Park take great care of this park.  Always makes me happy to walk my dog through the different plants.  Bonus points when things are in bloom.  Echium, fremontodendron, ceanothus, matilija poppy, yarrow....so many great plants!< /text>

We like this playground a lot. Squishy ground, lots of running space, something like 4 slides. Its enclosed, so it's easy to keep an eye on your little ones.<//Review>

<review>Good playground with a very nice view on a sunny day. Very nice specious playground and very clean. There's also a baskeball gym. I attended a basketball game there with my little ones team. The gym was heated which l appreciated it was so cold that day. The entrance to the playground is odd it's on a little short street you could pass it by. I advise you to use google maps for directions . I would've passed it up if l didn't use google for driving directions it was a big help.</review><time>1552778247417< /time><username>Certainly Cee Caldwell< /username>< rate>

I love this playground and so my 2.5 year old. We meet here every once in a while with her playgroup. It's a large playground, but enclosed with a fence. The equipment is in great condition and has a good mix of swings, slides, and climbing structures, all suitable for an active toddler, but still interesting to a slightly older child too. There is not a sandbox, or easily accessible bathroom, but parking is never a problem.</Review>

<UserId.>116925116332960548099</UserId.><text>Fun play structure has long walkways that connect an artificial hill on one side with a real one on the other; a metal tube slide goes from the top of the hill down. The playground is in good condition. Basketball and tennis courts adjacent and baseball field and a rec center above. Restrooms are currently portable toilets due to construction.<//text>< user_name>

Good playground with a huge structure and lots of activities covering a good age range.  Bathrooms available most of the time at the rec center just up the hill.  Occasional drainage problems from problematic landscaping design choices, but nothing serious.  Supports a good age range.

Fenced all around, but there are a lot of easily-opened gates at different elevation levels and some vision blockers, so maintaining a perimeter around a group of kids requires several adults -- don't expect to be able to supervise from a single fixed location.< /text>

<text>A public park that's mostly fenced in. If you have a child or a dog it's a perfect place to take them. There's a huge jungle gym area for the kids, open field for baseball or kickball, basketball court, tennis court and at the bottom of the hill there's a huge dog park!

If you want some friends for your well behaved dog to play with, bring them to the dog park on the south side of St. Mary's playground.<//text>< pics>

I don't have kids, so I don't know about the playground, but the off leash dog park is wonderful. fenced off with picnic tables, water for you and your pooch, and plenty of room to run. I live in the neighborhood and this park is looked after by the residents.</Text>

Good facilities for futsal and basketball. The Recreation and Park staff were really helpful opening the restroom. The facilities were clean. Parking can be tough near the west entrance, but you'll usually find a space.<//text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Now I know what you're thinking: why is the creepy man with the beard avatar reviewing a playground? The answer is that I'm a sucker for virtual internet points (I'm almost a Google Level 3 Guide!) and I have no shame.

Anyway, I've been here twice while babysitting my friends' toddler and he just f@#$ing loved it, so I'm passing along what I assume would be his 4 star rating. Could have gotten 5 stars if there had been more random garbage for him to attempt to put in his mouth, but you can't have it all.</Text>< gmap_id>

What a fantastic playground.  There's toddler swings for the little ones, lots of playground equipment for the grade schoolers, and basketball/tennis courts for teens/adults.

It's clean, welcoming and we felt safe. A big thank-you to whoever maintains it because you're doing a wonderful job.</review>

Love this park it's bigger than most parks I've been too in san francisco. No sand so it's less of a mess and lots of slides and space for kids to run around. There's chairs under the structure I think that's kind of cool.</review>

First time checking out this location. Quite a lot of parking spots, with easy access. Really enjoyed the fried shrimp and fish. The fried okra was a bit over-fried. Hopefully that was just a one time occurrence. The staff was very helpful!</Review>

<date>1528159538710< /date><Rating>3<//Rating><review>With a family consisting of little ones, Golden Corral's kids' special is pretty darn awesome.

We took advantage of their special this evening.  And it was well worth it.  The steak tonight was well seasoned but the sauteed mushrooms, which is a staple item on my plate when I visit, left me disappointed.

Overall, a great value on a budget and it fulfills all the cravings.

Update: went here after this review and was informed that the kids special was a seasonal promotion and has ended.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

When we walked in the Lady at the register was very welcoming. I took a look around the buffet and was pleasantly surprised at the selection presented. The young man waiting on us was not very friendly but the Lady Carving the meat was accommodating. What I served myself was very tasty, wanted to try other dishes but instead went for the dessert area, blueberry pie was excellent.<//review>

Good food with a good amount of choices. I'm giving 3 stars because they changed it so that milk is not on the buffet anymore and if you pay for a fountain drink it is not interchangeable, even though it's the same price so I had to go up front and pay again for the kids. Also, I had a family get together there and we had to keep waving down the waitress for refills instead of her periodically checking on us with how many we had.<//Text>

I Had a nice experience here, the food was good and the items looked fresh. Prices are reasonable payed a little over 100 for 4 adults and 3 kids during dinner. The staff was quick and attentive they picked up used dishes on time and served drinks when needed. Overall we enjoyed our time and will visit again.<//Text>

Last time I was there their fug fountain was broken and so was their cotton candy machine. They do serve prim rib on Saturday and Sunday nights. Their prices are 14.99 and 16.99 Monday thur Thursday. You have a wide range of food for everyone to enjoy, the table service was good for all you can eat buffet restaurants</Review>

<Review>Food was hit or miss; some of it was pretty good, some was alright, and some was pretty bad. The fried chicken in particular had REALLY bad batter, which is a shame because the chicken inside it tasted good.

Atmosphere was as good as I'd expect, and service was very friendly. My biggest concern was with the cleanliness of the plates, because most had deep scratches and were yellowed inside the scratches. I'm just not sure it's possible to clean in there properly. I'm guessing the plates are all plastic, and they should be replaced with ceramic for this reason.

Overall, I'd say it's worth the $10 they charge on special, but not much more.<//Review>< Pics>

Food is surprisingly good!  The steaks have a great flavor, the veggies are usually not overcooked...as with any buffet they have a few selections that are questionable, however most everything is prepared well and is tasty.  The establishment is clean and the staff is friendly. It's a buffet so it can get noisy.   I just put in ear buds and tune it all out with Netflix.  Cell reception isn't great...sit by a window and it will be enough to stream or make calls.</Text>

This Golden Corral has the worst service i have ever experienced. Dinner starts at 4pm. At least i thought. It was prime tib night and we paid for the dinner menu. They did not have prime rib or the dinner menu ready to serve. We were told that the prime rib would not be ready till 4:30 or 5pm. It became 5:30 and still no prime rib. I feel that they had happly taken our money for dinner, but didn't deliver.< /text>

<pics>None<//pics><rating>4< /rating><text>I was surprised to see no lines... something like that is either a good thing, or NOT a good thing...

My spareribs were great, although a little dry. My friends had steaks,  which were not cooked right. Usually a place like this has meat already cooking over the fire, some of it cooked rare, some medium, some well done. You tell them what you want, and they serve it up. But this place put meat on the grill when you order it, so you have to go and grab what else you want and come back for it, or just stand there and wait while it cooks. NOT a good system. A "well done" steak was so red, it was mooing!

Deserts were good, though... I especially recommend the carrot cake.

My dinner was good, but my friends were disappointed, so you take your chances. But the manager made good, got them new steaks cooked right, in a container to go, which is normally not allowed in an all~you~can~eat place... so 4 stars.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The staff at the murrieta location were all very sweet. I usually make it a point to memorize names, but I had 3 small boys with me so it totally slipped my mind lol. The staff was super attentive of clearing dishes. Then when we were leaving I was trying to be courteous and stack everything up and two women workers appeared out of nowhere to help and assure that they would do it. They said they appreciated that I was a busy mom and still trying to make their job easier. Small compliment with a big feel good outcome!< /review>

<text>We were not greeted by our server our server took 30 minutes to take our plates. The dining tables and the restroom were dirty and including the salad bar. The food was overcooked and did not have the taste or flavor. The soups had alot of salt. There were no employees working. In the kitchen there were only three employees. I will not be coming to this location again. And I do not recommend this location.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>We ate here when they first opened in Murrieta and the place was amazing. Since then they have taken the garlic sauce from the steak line. The steaks are the worst quality of meat ever. I don’t know what that is, it’s so tough that I accidentally chewed the inside of my cheek trying to chew through the fatty meat. The dishes are dirty and the rest of the food is mediocre at best.
My wife and I have tried about five times, hoping that the last time was a Management problem or a different Chef. We have finally concluded that this Golden Corral doesn’t care anything about producing quality food, high quality service , or washing dishes. This place has served us high priced garbage on a consistent basis and I am done trying to figure out when the good staff and good chef that we started with will be around. Go to Texas Roadhouse for a few more dollars and get some good quality food and service. Or go anywhere else besides this Golden Corral!< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
This location was not very good at all. The food temperature was lukewarm it was awful. Some foods were swimming in grease. The other reviews were not wrong on the whole dirty plates and utensils thing. I would recommend the Lake Elsinore location a million times over. The food was way better with more variety. I will say the cashier was really nice but the waiter not so much.<//Review>

First time there.  I was told that they are taking over Hometown Buffet. I think the food quality was better at Hometown. Sorry. The chocolate fountain was behind a glass partition,  and couldn't be accessed. How are we supposed to dip the dessert items that were located around it??< /Review>

It’s hard to believe they can stay in business with all the variety they offer. The food is good that is for a buffet and they also have hand scooped hard ice cream which is unusual for a buffet at this price. The salad bar is definitely less than say Soup Plantation however over all the prime staple here is not to come for s salad right?</text>

The food is good, but they are a little slow to refill items.  The price however is higher than it is worth in my opinion. 2 adults and 1 child was just over $50 including drinks. I would given more stars if the value was better.< /Review>

Not a good impression on a first visit to restaurant. First, the plates were all still dirty and really stained. Second, the food was not that flavorful. Steak was not seasoned. Dinner rolls were very hard on the bottom. Our "server" wasn't refilling our drinks and would disappear on us. To top it off an older guest like in his 60s let out a really loud one RIGHT NEXT TO OUR TABLE! as he was walking back to his seat. Discusting!  Sorry to say I will not be going back.<//review>

The food is clearly reheated frozen foods, but what can you really expect from a buffet. Not terrible but not great. Excellent service though. Me and my girlfriend had a wonderful young lady constantly taking care of our dishes and drinks. Good experience.< /Review>

We got there when it first opened. The food was so fresh and there is every kind of food you can imagine.
The employees were very nice but I think they were afraid of the manager. She wouldn't let any of them talk at any time, if you weren't with a customer you better be cleaning. I have been in grocery for over 20 years, I thought it was a bit much personally. I would recommend that location (Murrieta hot springs) for sure!!<//text>

Everything I ate was very good except the baked fish was a little Bland but besides that everything else was good including the desserts. The line to get in was pretty long but it moved pretty fast. I expected the line though on a Sunday afternoon after church. It was clean, good service & a nice selection of different foods of course. Very good restaurant I will definitely come back again soon.</text>

I don't have anything bad to say about the quality of service. Everyone was very attentive and courteous. The restaurant and bathrooms were clean. However, I feel I am getting more quantity than quality when I come to these buffet restaurants, so based solely on this location, I give the staff and cleanliness good marks. If you enjoy all you can eat, adequate quality food for a moderate to high price depending on the time of your visit, you will enjoy this restaurant.< /text>

The employees were very nice but I think they were afraid of the manager. She wouldn't let any of them talk at any time, if you weren't with a customer you better be cleaning. I have been in grocery for over 20 years, I thought it was a bit much personally. I would recommend that location (Murrieta hot springs) for sure!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I cast or only huge complaint is it’s our family night, and I really enjoy the time with my great niece and nephew who are both under 10. They see the chocolate fountain in the cotton candy machine on TV all the time, but these are constantly broken. You really might want to try and fix these, please please please<//text>< pictures>

Nice clean location. Staff is quick and efficient. Jennifer was our waitress and she was awesome. Jennifer had a positive attitude and cracked jokes all the way. Her personality made our experience that much better. We have been to this location on multiple locations since their grand opening and the service has been outstanding. The food is awesome. Yes, there are some dishes that can improve such as; the spaghetti which is a bit or miss item (sometimes the sauce is watery and the noodles are over cooked), they don't have much of a salad bar, and their dessert bar is small and always out of chocolate covered items. Other than that their steak and roast beef is awesome, their grilled shrimp is tatesty, and their rotisserie  chicken is golden. Also, would be awesome, if they offered military discounts for active, veterans. and retired personnel.<//review>

The fried chicken was so dry and most of the food was cold and nasty. Also they cheat you out of pricing there is a price posted on the Golden Corral website and then you get there it is much more then what they say. So just for lunch it cost more then Sizzler so I and the food and service sucked. So you are so much better off to go to the Sizzler down the street. NEVER GOING BACK TO A GOLDEN CORRAL EVER YOU GUYS SUCK.</Review>< user_id>

Four stars because this place is a hit or miss. I have been here several times and the service is good I cannot complain about that. But the food if you did not get it in the establishment we went a little bit after they had opened up recently and the food was phenomenal. Like I say it is a hit or miss.<//text>

Ok...so I went with the intention to try all of their food...I failed. So I came back a second time and almost....almost accomplished it. The food over all is good. Some of it is definitely great tasting and attorneys are just good. A small amount are standard tasteless but not bad. Come experience the buffet work an open mind. You will be surprised how great the food tastes, not to mention the variety of food from A to Z.<//Text>

<review>I enjoyed the food and the service. However I must draw the line at eating with animals. A patron was allowed to have her dogs--yes plural--dogs eat in the restaurant with her. She fed one of the dogs from your utensils. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  If this is to be common practice, I will not be returning and will discourage my friends and family from patronizing this location as well.

The patron said the dogs were service dogs but I don't think service dogs snap at children and neither do service dogs bark at passers-by. These dogs did both. The dogs were left unattended in a baby stroller while the patron got her food. He manoeuvred his way free from the cover and at one point had his head (and mouth) on the table.

Please note, the patron changed tables on her own upon her return and no special cleanup was performed and other guests were seated at the same table a few minutes later.

The dogs were not being antagonized neither were the other guests giving any added attention to the animals.

I have nothing against pets or service animals. But I don't pay to eat with them or after them.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Update (December 24, 2020): This eatery had been closed since the pandemic begun.

Originally Posted, back in 2018. – Golden Corral in Murrieta, CA is okay, food wise. Basic style buffet with a grill station, offering steak and other meat and pork options. The seating area is fairly large, it is a clean eating facility for the most part, and the atmosphere is laid back. Almost always, I find several of their fried food options to be very salty (beware). Their wait staff and cashiers are pretty good, I have never had any issues with them providing good customer service. Manager Aziza is quite nice and actually conversate with her customers. Decent place for a quick meal when you're away from your home.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

There is a wide variety of food, and the food is good. The price is as reasonable as any other restaurant in its class. It's an all-you-can-eat restaurant (a buffet) so when you go there, knock yourself out.</review>

Other Golden Coral locations have much better food. I hate leaving negative feedback, but this one just seemed to have stale and cold food and few choices. Just not what I expected I guess.< /Text>

< review>
This is about the Murrietta location. I've always gone to the Lake Elsinore location with no problem but decided to give Murrieta a try since it is at a better location. I'm usually not one to complain but today the food all tasted the same and was not hot. The dirty plates sat on our table for close to half an hour even though it was not busy. On my way out I approached the manager to share my feelings. I showed him a picture I took of our dirty plates sitting on the table and told him about the food. All he did was demand that I tell him who our waiter was which I was reluctant because I was hoping he would address it as a whole instead of just blame one person. I didn't even get an apology for the cold food and he just sent me on my way. Needless to say we won't be going back to the Murrieta location.< /review>

<Review>I have been waiting for a while to eat at a Golden Corral. I was not disappointed, though a couple of food items on the breakfast/ lunch menu were not the best(sausage gravy), most everything else was very good especially the sliders and mushroom beef. As far as a cafeteria style buffet goes, very clean and comfortable with plenty of seating at lunchtime.< /Review><UserId.>102140316055378611263</UserId.><date>1516059976990<//date></record>

<text>Rip off: Ad's on internet showed $8.00 for seniors till 4:00 with drink included.
Got there and price is $12.95 plus drink.
Then they tell me $8.00 is the international and not with their location.

Terrible experience! Dirty plate, stained cups and sticky forks. Most of the food looked like it came out of a can. This is the first time i give 1 star to any establishment. Worse than fast food! Never again!<//Text>

<text>We have been here several times and it is usually pretty good.  Most of the time we have had a wheel chair person with us.  Today they put us at the furthest table in the restraunt, which forced us to have to go all around to avoid other diners and high chairs. Very awkward and uncomfortable.

The food looked like things were not to fresh and we're not being frequently rotated.  Not sure what is going on at this location but for an average of $18 per person you do expect a little quality.  It will be a while before we drive 45 minutes for this again....< /text>< Rating>

As I live in Murrieta, all those coming from a long distance to eat at this establishment, be aware that there was nothing here but dirt 8 months ago. They are still in the process of building it from the ground up. I have anticipated the opening date but cannot find a date it will actually open. I love Golden Corral and their food, and now they will be convenient to where I live and won't have to go to Lake Elsinore anymore.<//text>

Horrible customer service. Management sucks! The male (Hispanic with glasses) and female (black heavy set) managers need management training and need to work on their people skills. My husband, two daughters and I went in for dinner but one of my daughter’s did not want to eat because she wasn’t hungry plus had a toothache. We were questioned by the cashier who then called the female manager who questioned her again and then the waitress did the same. Then myself and my other daughter were getting our food when the female manager came straight  over and bent down to look directly at my child from under the glass and gave her a dirty look then proceeded to go to the male manager and pointed at us. So I went to them and asked what their problem was? He said well she said that she didn’t pay and isn’t supposed to be eating. I said we did pay for her and the one who chose not to eat is sitting right over there NOT eating and drinking her drink that we DID pay for! They embarrassed us and caused a scene and made us look as if we stole something from their tacky low budget Home Town Buffet knock off in front of other customers. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THAT PLACE AGAIN!</Text>

<text>If you've ever been to Home Town Buffet, or the like, then you know what you're in for. Food is very hit or miss, with the fried rice drowning in oil and the bacon being soft but the Honey Sesame Chicken being crispy and the potatoes fluffy. Our server was attentive and came around often even though she seemed to be the only one bussing tables during brunch rush, so kudos there.

Overall, not bad; your experience may vary.< /text>< Pics>

To All of the SPECIAL THANK U. MAY GOD BLESS EACH OF OF THEM! I ENJOYED THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE & THE FOOD AT THE MURRIETA GOLDEN CORRAL RESTAURANT WAS ABOVE EXCELLENT IN THE BEGINNING TO THE END. THE ONLY THING NEGATIVE, WAS THE SEATING, THE WAITING LINES ARE NOT WHEELCHAIR FRIENDLY.. THEY NEED TO REDESIGN THERE TABLES,& SPACE.. I WAS RUNNING INTO ROAD BLOCKS WITH HAVING PEOPLE GET UP TO LET ME GET TO MY TABLE OR INTO A LINE FOR THE BUFFET CHOICES.. PLEASE NOTE SEVEN THROUGH ALL THAT! I SATISFIED AT THE END OF MY MEAL.AGAIN GOD BLESS .< /text>< Pictures>

This location isnt as great as the el cajon one. The staff here looked uninterested, the food was okay. Though I do like how the staff come to your table to refill your sodas and check on you often. That's a nice part<//Review>

Terrible food, never going back to eat there, stuff really bad service specially the owner susan or Susie!!! She lies to customers by telling them one thing, and then when you get to the restaurant, she tells you another lie saying that the supervisor said one thing when she's really the Boss. And she's very rude to customers!!!</Review>

service was the worst thing, they appear at the end I wonder why. Food was good but it feels uncomfortable when the waiters pass by you and you feel left out like they choose who they want to serve.< /Review>

Kind of a waste of money food was sub par. I noticed alot of the plates were dirty its $16.79 for adults for dinner not $12 FYI & you only get a $4 off coupon if it's your bday supposed its supposed to be free.

<rating>4</rating><text>If you've ever been to Home Town Buffet, or the like, then you know what you're in for. Food is very hit or miss, with the fried rice drowning in oil and the bacon being soft but the Honey Sesame Chicken being crispy and the potatoes fluffy. Our server was attentive and came around often even though she seemed to be the only one bussing tables during brunch rush, so kudos there.

Overall, not bad; your experience may vary.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The food is not that great for $12 a person 4 lunch.   And they need to stop being cheapskates and get an exterminator!! my friend had an ant crawling on his plate and on the table...after looking around..the ants were crawling on a ledge holding out table up on the wall..the wall was filthy with food splatters. Thats probably why the come inside. The poor server girl was frantic trying to clean them. Hey management if your going to make cut backs pick another dept. Cuz bugs on my table is NOT where its at!!!!!< /Text>

I/we were waiting for the place to open for a long time. We actually couldn't wait to eat there until today.
The restaurant is clean as expected, (third day of opening). The service was good; however it quite pricy. It's not a place you can plan on visiting biweekly or even once a month. The food verity was good, but overly salty. Too much salt is used in almost everything we tried.<//review>

Wasn't impress at all! Home town buffet is better. It was crowded in a place so small and it was noisy with the people surrounding you and the noise of the employees cooking. The pizza crust was burnt and soggy... The macarroni and cheese was dried and etc. The only thing i could say that was good it was that the waitresses were attentive to what we need.< /Review>

I am from the south where there is an abundance of Golden Corral's this one here in Murrieta California was pretty good the vegetables the meets all were pretty good sometimes a little too much salt on some items but for the most part it was very good only if they had catfish  that would be the bomb the one in Lake Elsinore is poor very poor probably won't visit that one again but Murrieta thumbs up and the chef Tony excellent conversation and cook good luck Tony.</Text>

Compared to all the other Golden Corrals we've been to, this is the worst one.  Food not very good quality for price paid.  First location that offers No military discount at all.  Considering Golden Corral supports vets and military, this is pretty sad.  My fellow buddies and I will be going to other Golden Corral locations from now on that are more military friendly.< /Text>

It was just okay. The most disappointing part was the steak. It was clearly a cheap cut and wasnvery tough. We could barely saw through it with our knives. The waitress was very nice and overall the food was pretty fresh.</text>

Theoretically worked for the keto eater and vegan in our group. Something for everyone.
However, when I asked for a spoon for a mushroom dish I was given one straight from a pot roast dish. Cross contamination.  What if I had been allergic to something in the pot roast dish or didn't eat meat? A new serving spoon would have been the right call.</review>

It was okay.   Definitely over priced.   $100 for a family of 4 to eat buffet style food?  Not high quality food either!< /Text>

First of all take a look at the silverware. Before your take a bite check out how clean what you're eating off of is. All the silverware and dishes were kind of gross. All of it was spotty and the carpet there was heavily stained. I wouldve rated a one star but the food wasnt that bad and the employees bust their asses to keep the place running. Good service poor health.</text>

Just average. We went on a Sunday and in the afternoon they moved all the food around. Same food just put in a sifferent place. Not sure what is going on there. Too much yelling from the kitchen, they need to invest in walkie talkies and eat pieces.</text>

Macaroni came out cold; had frozen flakes in it as staff set it down and stirred it. Spinach was wilted and half of strawberries were rotten. Chicken was cold and old. Fries were limp. Pizza was old and lukewarm. Lady that identified herself as kitchen management kept denying everything I stated based on what myself and my children tasted and said that she knew the food was changed every ten minutes. That did not happen. She refused to help. She walked off during the conversation with her. She was rude and I know why their restaurant did not have many people in it and it was dinner time. It was a terrible experience.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This is our 4th visit to eat at Golden Corral and our last time.  The hot food was room temp or cold.  The fried chicken was dry and overcooked. None of the hot food was hot or warm, food was terrible.</text>

<text>I was very disappointed in the quality of food at this restaurant. I realize it is a buffet, but at $15.99 per adult plus $2.49 for a large drink, our 4 person total came to over $81.00. Wow!  We will not return. The staff was very nice and our waiter made sure to clear plates and refill drinks, so if you go, be sure to tip your waiter.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Sad that this represents our culture today. It's food for consumption and that's about it. Nourishing? Maybe. Filling? Yes. Tasty? NOPE!! Loads of food that packs on the pounds. Look at most people that go to these places. Over weight and sick.....made a tactical error today....lesson learned.< /text><Time>1508099249602< /Time><Name>David Behm<//Name><UserId.>114527813013027333473</UserId.><rate>1< /rate>< pics>

Since this location just opened a couple of weeks ago,  it was so crowded!  Lines were so long!   The food was good.  I would go there again but I will wait until the crowds die down, because it was just too many people and hard to get to the food!<//review>

<text>I dunno?...
Just went in with my Bride, unplanned - saw it on the road and had an early bird dinner.😉
Uhhh really?  ~Seafood, meats, pro-salad bar, seasonal veggies and oh my, a bakery!
Didn't spend more than $25 after tax and tips.
Staff and service was more than we expected.

<text>I like the variety of foods offered. Unfortunately,  the breakfast/brunch on Sunday ends at 12 and all the breakfast foods are thrown out. Nevermind the how so much waste contributes to global warming; brunch means breakfast/lunch. I felt cheated because I didn't get breakfast that morning 😜< /text>< Pics>

Update; the newness has worn off and it's not as crowded as it used to be. So I've changed my rating to four stars. The food continues to be very good, the wait staff okay, my only real complaint at this point is that the drinks are not readily available. You have to wait for a waiter to go get you one. Not really a major problem just inconvenient.
Orginal; I continue to try Golden corral even though I don't enjoy the atmosphere. The food is excellent, the staff ok, but being packed in like sardines is uncomfortable.<//Review>

Great service!....the food is ok, if you get it when it first comes out its pretty good but after that it can be dry, hard etc.....it's a buffet pretty much typical for that type of food....with that said it is definitely better than the average.... and the service is outstanding!</review>

I was a little surprised at the price. I think it was $14.95 per adult for dinner, not including a drink. Drinks are an extra $2.50. The food is not bad, but for $17.50 per person, I'd rather eat someplace where all the food is good or better, not just "not bad."</review>

This place is actually not bad at all, they keep the food fresh, and they do have a good variety,  the desserts are amazing, it was my brothers birthday,  and only thing is, if you have a birthday coupon,  it needs to be printed,  they won't take it from your phone<//Text>

The food was bland and mostly eggs and sausage! We love the golden corral in city of industry! I don't know what happened here! Paid for dinner at 1pm  and still had breakfast foods out. They said the dinner foods wouldn't be out until 2pm. We would have to wait! Who wants to go to dinner and wait an hour to eat! Not our family, for sure! The kids filled up on sweets waiting for dinner. A lot of people were complaining about waiting. This was a learning lesson, as we usually head to Sizzler. Next Sunday we'll be once again heading back to Sizzler. I guess the old saying is right!!! (You get what you pay for)!< /Text>

<Review>I love the selection but since you can't bring anything home in a doggy bag I feel you have to over eat to get your money's worth as it is so expensive to eat there now.  You leave feeling sick and or like you didn't get what you paid for.  I always like to bring food home so I can enjoy more later and not be forced to eat so much at one sitting.  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.<//Review>< Time>

I was a little surprised at the price. I think it was $14.95 per adult for dinner, not including a drink. Drinks are an extra $2.50. The food is not bad, but for $17.50 per person, I'd rather eat someplace where all the food is good or better, not just "not bad."< /review>

The manger is very unprofessional when it come to finding hair in your food. He blamed other customers stating that the hair could have from them. Smh I was very disappointed and Not so ever satisfied eating at this place. If u eat your food her make sure you check out your food.</review>

Many of the employees looked miserable. However, I will say that the busser did the best job she could, the mashed potatoes & fries were real potatoes and that the place was relatively clean (probably because hardly anyone was there), and for that I leave two gold stars. I'd probably only come back if I was really high and lacked better judgement.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The real problem is management because they won't let their wait staff clean the main room, not to mentipn a terrible sysyrm for seating. Combined with underwhelming food and an overall unorganized feeling, I obly wish I could give it less than zero stars.The one saving grace, a wait staff that truly values the infividual customer. Bit this is no enough to save Golden Corral in Murrieta from its issues. So my final rating is a big red X. 100% DO NOT RECOMMEND.</Review>

I assumed the menu would be the same. There was no fried catfish, fried okra, fried green tomatoes,  collard greens, sauteed okra,  hush puppies, enchiladas, etc. What they did have was good but not what I was expecting.<//Review>< pics>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>It was very clean and the staff was friendly. However the food was not good. I generally like golden corral, but this was my first time at this location, and I will not be returning. We went for breakfast (arrived before 9a.m) and the selection was minimal! There were a few breakfast items and mostly lunch/dinner items. Who wants dry pizza, teriyaki chicken, spaghetti, etc for breakfast? I drove all the way from San Jacinto just to be disappointed.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>No matter were I turned I ran into an employee. They just barged by like I was not there. Then the waitress would come every five minutes and interrupt our conversation and the first few times is fine but by the 7th 8th time it got too much. The desert was great but the other food was ok. They still had breakfast stuff out at 330 so that made a lot of options very limited of what to get</text>< pics>

Well, my son wanted to eat there for his B-day dinner. So after paying $60 for 4 of us we hoped it would be a great experience.
The good points: Staff were courteous, attentive, and full of welcoming smiles.👍
Grilled sirloin steak quality was pretty good and grilled to ordered, the smoked hickory chicken & ribs were flavorful.
The Bad "Salty" points: Its a total shame that all the food mentioned above were all salty. All the starches like rice, potatoes were all salty. The only things not salty was the salad bar and dessert. I tried giving the benefit of the doubt so I tried the fried fish. And again, fish batter was salty and fish was salty. My wife and son all said the same thing. I decided to look up reviews during this Birthday meal and found out that NATIONWIDE(CA, AZ, SC) , all the reviews say the same SALTY theme. I should have looked at it prior to paying $60.
I've worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years and know that this is a tactic so that customers get fuller quicker once their body's salt level rises. If you have health conditions with blood pressure risks, please do not eat here. I urge the company to cut 40% of the salt on all the dishes. If they do, I'd gladly write a new review with 4's and 5 stars. I give a star for the great staff, and a star for fresh quality, but —stars for making people pay there $15 and not only make them full quicker, but put in health risks. Please read other reviews before going here.
To Golden Corral: Your tactics are noticed and not appreciated. We will gladly return if you lower your sodium levels on your dishes.</Text><Date>1507174801231</Date>< Name>

Golden Corral has excellent service and food.Ann Somers from Murietta chamber of commerce was totally rude saying it was like being a herd of cattle.The place is set up perfectly.Great place for seniors on a fixed income to get a great meal.Highly recommend to all👍👍😘<//Text>

<Text>I have been to several Golden Corral Restaurants, at times in different states. This Golden Corral does not serve fried chicken breast or wings. This restaurant only servrd fried Chicken thighs, most of the food is good the servers are excellent. Italian sausages fried chick. Unsatisfactory. Also no fried liver and onions. Where is the wh uhh re meat CHICKEN, Liver and onions. ITALIAN SAUSAGES, with bell pepper and onion s, and .then you are good or excellent. All Golden Corrals serve. Those items listed above.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I've been to this location twice. The second even worse than the first. Dry food, LOADED with salt and oils, 10 minutes to cook an omelette is too long. Even the chili was missing a lot of the seasoning. I don't expect much from a place like this but come on now. I will not return.<//Review>

<Text>I can't understand the negative reviews I've read. Maybe customers who dined at GC when they first opened had a less than desirable experience.
Now for my experience.  My friend and I went to Murrieta GC for lunch on a Friday at around 11am, not too many people, but more came in closer to noon. It was our first time eating at a Golden Corral so it took a couple of minutes to get our bearings. After paying and getting our beverages we found a table and put utensils and napkins and drinks down.Before
choosing our food we scanned each section so we could see everything .We were so surprised at the variety of food offered!
Despite other reviews, there were at least 6 vegetables, all were piping hot and  cooked just right, not overcooked or undercooked.The baked potato were a nice touch, also nice and hot with sour cream and butter right there.
Numerous entrees were offered that should satisfy any taste. Even a taco bar and Chinese
food. I tried the pulled pork, it was tender, juicy,slightly smokey delicious! I also tried
the spaghetti. The sauce was tasty enough but the pasta had become very soft. My friend had tacos and pot roast which she liked very much.  So many more choices but you can't try everthing! Allthough the salad area was well stocked we decided not to fill up on salad but to save room for dessert. After reading previous reviews I didn't expect much from the dessert station but wow, what a surprise to see pecan pie,carrot cake, lemon meringue pie, red velvet
cake and too many others to mention. Between the two of us we tried the pecan pie, soft serve ice cream and turtle cheesecake. They were all great! To also refute prior reviews the restaurant was immaculate, food stations were frequently being wiped down as soon as necessary, our server was sweet and helpful and came by at least 3 times to see if we needed refills.As a couple of people have mentioned, it is a little pricy for lunch but considering the quality and variety well worth it! Anxious to bring my husband for dinner!

If you are a senior and can get there before 4 p.m., you can get your dinner for $10. If you want animal meat go to Golden Corral, if you don't care about the meat go to Souplantation.</Review>< Resp>

I was all excited to try this Golden Corral but left vary  disappointed. The food had no taste, the hot buns were hard as hell, the grill pork tasted burnt, the omelets look scramble. Tried other foods but still a Waste of 30 dollars.< /text>

< Review>
I first went to opening in san bernardino and then to the one that opened in lake elsinore, ca.  I was dissappointed to find out that the beef rib (the reason i wanted to come back after eating it at san bern grand opening) was not available and was told that it was only available in the first few weeks of a store opening and was told it was offered to attract customers.  I would have given five stars, but they took away the beef rib and pork rib. It started to feel like hometown with sliced ham and sliced prime rib......< /Review>

When it first opened I went there and there was flies all over the restaurant the manager said they have a problem with one of the machines but they was going to fix it. Some of the employees didn't seem professional to me they were dropping food and dropping plates.<//Review>

Basic buffet. You get your drinks at the front and when you want refills the server gets it for you. Honestly having two soda machines in the front of the building instead of the buffet seemed really odd</review>

Terrible,cold food and breakfast items still out, dried out and cold, manager did not care was rude and did not try and be helpful or ask how she could help, servers were not to be found to refill drinks, manager did not come out to talk to us upon request till we went to her office, most unprofessional person I have met, will never go back..Azizra get a job your good at, you have no idea how to run a business.</Review>

Website states the closing time was 10:00pm. We got there at 8:40 and they wouldn't let us in. The staff there said they closed at 9:00pm.  Very unprofessional place.</Review>

We just came here for lunch to find out that it's closed for business. There are a few people here for job interviews but they can't get a hold of anyone. The doors are locked and doesn't seem to be anyone inside.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Inhuman the owner did not send me to the doctor when one of my co-workers hit me with the refrigerator door. I don't know, and the next day the owner told me that I had to do things faster, since a day before that happened to me. The only thing he did was run to the partner. They didn't even ask me how I was doing. I couldn't walk well it was inhuman. A few days later I took care of the hospital because my nail hurt a lot and he was not responsible. To her right hand I immediately commented on what was done and how I was going with my nail and as many photos I showed them.

(Original)
Inhumanos la dueña no me mando al doctor cuando una de mis compañera de trabajo me golpeó con la puerta del refrigerador. Se los no Se saber y al otro día la dueña me dijo q tenia q hacer más rápido las cosas siendo q un día antes me paso eso. Lo único q hizo fue correr a la compañera. Ni siquiera me preguntaron como estaba. Yo no podia caminar bien fue inhumana. A los días cui al hospital por q mi uña me dolía mucho y no se hizo responsable. Ala mano derecha de ella de inmediato le comente lo susedido y de como iba con mi uña y asta fotos les enseñe.<//Text>
