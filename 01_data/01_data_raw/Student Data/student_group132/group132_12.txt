seriously they never answer the phone. I have asked countless times that they not add a certain ingredient and every. single. time. it is delivered through door dash it is STILL in there. I think their door dash and app only work if you do NOT make any changes. if you are allergic to something, you will be out of luck.  they need to fix the phone number situation and make the app a little easier to sub stuff, to make it work. nightmare.<//Text>

I was given the impression that the employees didn't want to be here. In some weird way, I started to feel what they were putting off. For a second I almost left.

I stuck around because my girlfriend had already ordered ahead of me. And plus we were short on time.

I planned on giving this place 2 stars maybe even 1, but I bumped it up to a 3. The only reason I did was solely because I was impressed on how well my peanut butter moo'd came out.</text>

We stored our belongings for about 5 months as we prepared to move out of the area. The manager was friendly & helpful and made us feel good about storing at this location. The inside unit we chose (5x14) worked well for us and was easy to access. Thank you!<//Text>

My experience with StoragePro is amazing always friendly and professional. The facility is always clean and I feel safe. I rented in the past and I am back!! Would not go anywhere else.  The manager is the nicest person and was one of the main reasons for coming back. No matter if you need storage for 2 months or 2 years your treated with kindness and respect. Definitely worth it.< /review>

<Review>Superb Customer Service! Very very affordable as well. The lady working there was wonderful and I felt very comfortable with the facility as a whole. The property is clean and tidy. It seems very safe and secure. The area is a little rough but do not let that deter you from storing your belongings here. I looked and looked for a facility and then I found this one. I would call it a best kept secret in the area. Definitely 5⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ STAR worthy!

<Text>The customer service here is excellent. Jamaica Taylor is very professional and has a great spirit with a beautiful personality about her, every single time that I decide to make a walk in payment. Matter of fact, to be honest, its because of her welcoming demeanor, the reason why I pay in person. Not to mention, indulging into healthy conversation before I conclude the visit. All I know if nothing else is that, if I owned a company I would want her to be the person who deals directly with the customers. I could see her perhaps owning her own company some day. I would instantly locate it and of course invest in her business and success there as well...THANK YOU !!!!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>Jamaica and Chavone were great to work with! They offered excellent customer service. If I ever need storage space again in the Oakland area, I will certainly go back to this particular StoragePro. I’m only giving four stars because my unit was an outside unit and collected so much dust a debris. I had to wipe everything down before I could load in into a truck.<//Review>< pics>

Joyce is always a big help she answers all my questions. She also speaks very kindly when you don't understand something. I always feel at ease and never rushed when I call.

Debbie is a great help as well.  Like i stated I always feel at ease when speaking to them at Storage Pro of Oakland..

Thank you ladies for always being professional and friendly..

Went through drive thru. Two cars in front but went really fast. Ordered a Whopper and chicken sandwich. Both were hot and good. Will go back.<//text>

I do not love their hamburgers, but the chicken sandwich is passable with obligatory fries. With so many other dining options one might wonder why here, why now? But sometimes, you just need a quick fix for a cheap bite and this location usually gets you  "in and out" faster than shleping to other trendy burger joints. Friendly drive-thru staff and a nicer-than-average facility in this upscale shipping center helps assuage your nagging reticence to embark upon such a banal culinary journey.<//review>

Cheap food at this location - excellent. Staff is always timely even when they have a full house. There was quick, helpful, and friendly service. Bring your appetite because portions are generous. I see why this place has a lot of good reviews.</Review>

I've been taking my old Beamer to Optimal Auto for about 7 years and trust Nate, Meg and their whole team implicitly. Blake is especially patient and helpful with my mechanically challenged brain. Highly recommend.</Review>

I called around before choosing Nate Smith. I had done some research online and knew what service I needed. I had disconnected my seat wiring harnesses while detailing my car, which caused the airbag indicator light to come on. In my VW it requires a diagnostic tool to reset it. The other shops I called estimated higher prices and longer service times. I was able to drop off my car the same day at Nate Smith's and pick it up a couple hours later. They did exactly what I asked and didn't charge an unreasonable price. I'll go to Nate Smith again for sure.< /Text>

Excellent service with careful attention to detail.  Our car was running badly with some mysterious symptoms.  The guys at Optimal got the car running better than ever, with improved mileage and response.  They were on time, courteous and professional.  An excellent, trustworthy shop.  I would highly recommend.</review>

I recommend Nate Smith’s Optimal Auto. They are knowledgeable, good diagnostic technicians,  have honest pricing and everyone is very nice. This was my first visit and I am very happy to have found someone who cared enough to keep me in the road and who I can count on as a friend.< /Review>

Efficient and honest mechanics. Riggo talked me through the whole process. My car might just be on its last leg and I’m glad I didn’t dump a bunch of more money into it. Hope I don’t have to come back but if I need any repairs on this car or my next vw, I will be bringing it here. Thanks guys.<//Review>

Optimal auto care is one of the perks of living in Santa Cruz. I have been a loyal customer for over 25 years. I have brought seven cars to them over this time to be serviced, and always appreciate how I can just drop the keys off and know that I will get excellent service. Also, Meg and Nate are some of the nicest people I know. With some of the sweetest dogs as well…<//Text>

<text>Nate and his team are great. They know European cars inside and out and stand by their work. I had a clutch with a bad throw out bearing (it had melted) and even though they had replaced the clutch two years prior they stood by their work. They even will tell you if they see other issues and having them addressed at the same time saved me a boatload on labor Costs. I recommend them without reservations.<//text><userid>103215175242890722318< /userid>< rating>

Saw me the day I called. Replaced the battery and did electrical service check while I waited. Pretty efficient.
Also, the dog who works as the shop’s greeter is very professional and polite. Greets customers with a friendly nuzzle and tail wag but then leaves them be. Very well trained.< /Review>

Wonderful staff, knowledgeable and friendly. Always find the issue and repair it for a reasonable cost (keep in mind these are BMWs!)

When something goes wrong, they make sure to make it right.

They even fix my mistakes when I screw up attempting to work on my car myself, without too much ribbing.

Can't recommend them highly enough, Optimal Auto is great!</Text>

I have finally found my Auto Care place!
My first visit on Tuesday was the best customer service satisfaction I have received. From the initial phone call with Blake who found me a spot to have my car serviced as I was leaving town. Plus the continued first class service from him when I dropped it off to picking it up.
Everybody was friendly and professional.
I highly recommend Nate Smith's Optimal Auto Care they are the best!!</Text>

I have been using Optimal Auto for several years for my 2003 540i. The biggest reason I have kept this older high mileage car on the road is the security of having highly skilled people work on it when I need repairs at responsible prices. You get personal service from owners that are hands on and right there at the front counter that remember your name.

I have used Nate Smith's Optimal Auto for over 7 years and 2 Bones. They always have gone out of their way to accommodate me and are great at communicating. I especially love that lately I have been greeted by furry companions. They work hard to get the job done and I will continue to use their great service.</review>

I would not take my car anywhere else.  Their service and support is so much better than any other place I have taken my car to.  Their prices are also very reasonable.  I highly recommend them.<//Text>

I’m really happy with Nate Smith Optimal Auto.  If you have a BMW, you will find no better on this side of the hill, and outside of an actual dealership.

There have been several times where I brought my car in, thinking that I knew what was wrong, and bracing myself for a high repair bill.  After diagnosing, they told me It was something far less drastic, and far less expensive to fix.  In other words, they could easily have agreed with me and charged $2k-$3k for service, but chose to be honest and only charged me $300.  They also frequently tell me “this thing here is going bad but it isn’t urgent.  We will look again when you are back in here to see if it needs replacing then.

It’s circumstances like this they build trust, and I trust Nate Smith more than any other shop to service my BMW.</review>

Nate, Meg and their team run a terrific business!  They are always friendly and helpful - and sometimes even offer to fix something on the spot for no charge! Otherwise for the bigger jobs, I've grown to completely trust them over the years!  They identify problems that are subtle or tricky to diagnose, yet never seem to recommend things that are not necessary. They solve problems in the simplest way. They don't over-diagnose or over-repair. This is just one reason I trust them. They're great people! and a pleasure to work with!< /text>

I’ve taken my 335i here twice for service; the guys are solid. Their inspection plan, the customer service, and their ability to finish the job on-time makes them as invaluable as any service shop within a BMW dealer from Stevens Creek down to Monterey.

They go above and beyond with their work; my car feels brand new again.

Overall five stars for thorough work, quality customer care, and their atmosphere is welcoming.

I’ve taken my previous two BMWs to European Auto Performance in Cupertino since 2004; these guys are as good as my last shop.

They’re my only goto in the Santa Cruz region, no one else does this level of work for their price point.

A large repair shop specializing in foriegn cars.  The people behind the counter where friendly and the shop was clean.   Getting in and out of the parking lot could be a challenge though.</Review>

Not only are they are honest and very fairly priced, they're professional and extremely helpful.  We couldn't imagine entrusting our car to anyone else!!  Thank you Nate and your entire team.<//text>< name>

Nate saved the day for me and my grandkids! I needed a belt adjusted on my BMW convertible so we could go cruising. May did the adjustment at no charge and his wife and dog entertained the kids while the work was being done! I have been back since and can’t say enough about the workmanship!!<//review>

The technician failed to reset the stereo and clock after disconnecting the battery. Also, the service writer did not notify me on Thursday morning when I brought car in that the work would not be completed the same day.</Text>

I have been receiving emails regarding changes made during the COVID, apparently, the only email that I failed to read was the fee changes? I have been a member of this gym for over 3 years, and I have been paying the basic $9.99 fee. Recently, I woke up to a charge of $19.99, which I didn't agree to and I did not sign on, and now, I woke up with a charge of $58.99, apparently, an annual fee THAT I HAVE NEVER PAID IN THE PAST. It is very unfortunate that I have trusted the gym with my bank account information for many years, and for them to think it is okay to just start charging any fees without ANY SIGNED agreement or authorization. They have definitely broken the trust that I had in them.</Text>

As I signed up for that purpose and was told it would be present, I am dissatisfied paying for a gym membership I will likely not use as much, after being bait-and-switched.

The rest of the equipment works..but for 50 a month I would have hoped for more amenities than your standard planet fitness level gym.
Best of luck.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Just had to leave this place because I was asked to download an app to answer questions about covid symptoms. First off how is this barely a requirement? And second you seen I was in a rush in a time crunch and kinda annoyed being asked to do that before I can enjoy my workout... Why couldn't they ask me the questions and allow me to download the app when I had the time... Horrible customer service I give this location a Tumbs down very disappointed I really needed to workout since my day was soo stressful!! Thinking of changing gyms at this point!!</Review>

Great gym 💪. My wife and I like this gym. We've been members for about 3years.  Keep up the great work. Nice to know you're open for business.

I also think 15 a month is good.  Sauna is usually out of order.  Not getting warm enough in there.  And the ropes for the resistant machines are worn down.  With that many members you gotta keep up with the demand.  Smooth Bar is great  decent prices.  They have energy drinks,  water,  other drinks to fuel you.  They have a new gym at the old Sierra club on blackstone but you must be a platinum member. Massage chair is great to have access to. I hate that they don't have a better area to stretch.  I was a blast fitness member and they had a massage table and a stretch stationary  machine.  I was able to fully stretch everything!  All in all not bad could be better still enjoy it there.< /Text>< Pictures>

You guys really need to do something about your opening employees! They are constantly late to open, I'm not talking about a few minutes. Sometimes it's been 15 to 20 min past 5 am and there is no one there yet! For some of us this is the only time we have to work out. Please do something about this asap! Right at this moment I'm waiting outside your facility and you have yet to open.< /text>

<Review>Their BOXING program is FANTASTIC! Full body workouts: cardio, strength, stretching, abs, and of course, boxing! For beginners, fighters, and anyone who just wants to get in shape. Friendly, stress-free environment. They WON'T throw you in the ring to get beat up. They make sure you have a foundation of knowledge to pull from, and then put you in with an experienced person who can go to YOUR level and not try to knock you out, IF you want to spar (practice fight). The boxing class is Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 4-6pm, Tuesday & Thursday 7:30pm to 9pm, and Saturday from 10am to 11:30am.<//Review>< Pictures>

I love coming to this gym, mainly for the EvoFit class! The instructor Victor is awesome and very motivational. Along with my own hard work and determination, Victor has helped me reach my goals every month, and continues to do so! Highly recommend coming and checking out this class!!</Review>

<Text>The gym itself was clean and very usable, the extra classes were great as well. My problem was with the staff that signed me up, they did not tell me everything I needed to know or the extra charges associated with the membership. When my work changed me over to a corporate membership, fit republic charged me an extra month and a service fee even though my account was frozen. I have been waiting for 2 months for a refund from the fit Republic corporate office, there are no phone numbers to contact anyone at fit Republic, the only number they give you is to a third party billing service so there is no way to contact corporate office. The staff at the gym has emailed several times since that is the only way that they can get ahold of them and at this point they have still refused to refund the amount of credit on my account. Fit Republic corporate are horrible people to work with, they are quick to take your money but refuse to refund any overcharges.< /Text>< pics>

The gym itself is just fine but the staff acts like you are bothering them every time you call or go to the desk to inquire about the description or time of classes, when some gym locations don't list classes online so you HAVE to call.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I became a member as soon as they opened the Ashlan location. Jumped on the 14.99 premium special. I asked if they took credit cards, they said yes. So I handed them my credit card and they took my info. 2 months later I hadn't been billed once so I went in to ask them what's going on. I was told sometimes it takes a while to process you should be fine. Suddenly I'm getting calls for late fees and unpaid membership fees. Time to talk to a manager.

This place in particular is a joke. I work 6 days a week from morning till evening. Since I'm busy it was impossible to talk to a manager. That manager was never there, even on days they told me would be best to find her, I'd go and they told me she left early. Finally I see her and ask her what happened. She says they don't take credit cards and I'll have to pay all the fees including late fees. Oh and also the annual $40 dollar fee, don't let them sneak that one by you. It's required for everyone. I basically had to pay for one of their employees mistake. I told them just cancel my membership and suddenly the amount due jumped way up. I told them go screw yourself.

Talked to a manager at the Clovis place and they were much more helpful and offered me a deal to stay and they'd erase the late fees. That was fair but I didn't have a chance to go to arrange that due to my schedule. So in just days I got taken to collections and had to pay just under $400. Their collection agency is even worse! They call you out of nowhere and demand that you pay right then and there or they'll report it on your credit.

All over just a horrible experience. Don't get fooled by the 10 dollar membership and no contracts. There's the 40 dollar annual fee and they want your debit card on file for automatic withdrawal. The employees at Ashlan in particular can't be more than 1 month out of high school. Just look at the reviews, avoid this scam gym.</Review>

<Review>Beware of this gym. They will lure you in with their low prices, and charge you a monthly membership fee FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. Their unwritten cancellation policy requires that you speak with a manager before they will agree to stop charging your credit card. This would be fine if the manager was ever in the office/returned phone calls. They are scamming the people of Fresno, and it is really unfortunate that businesses like this continue to operate while blatantly stealing from customers.< /Review>< user_id>

<text>Horrible experience! This company promises no contracts but instead has hidden agreements in their cancellation policy. If you do not cancel according to the manner of their agreement then they continue charging you. They will keep racking up the charges and then send you to collections!! I went only (1) time to their gym and due to dissatisfaction I stopped going there. I called to cancel and they told me it was okay since it was month to month but never told me that I had to submit a request in writing....6 months later I get a phone call from a collection agency asking for $229!!!!! I called the manager at this location and was told "there is nothing they can do"!!! This gym is ripping people off and being dishonest. This corporation lacks integrity and does NOT know the true meaning of customer service.</text>< pictures>

It's cheap, thats about all I can say. The machines aren't well maintained. If something breaks, it typically stays broken for months. You have to check out the cable attachments, which is super annoying.< /text>

Equipment is constantly out of order. Sauna has been broken since last winter. Women's locker room is always filthy and smells like dead hookers. I hope Fit Republic can fix this gym soon.<//review>

They say No contract but if you're charging membership fee's then I guess you are in a contract. I don't trust this gym< /review>< pictures>

< review>
Turc`s has been around for a long long time.  All it needs to really be in the black (making money) is an owner with the personality of a  past owner Michael Patty.  GOD rest his soul.  Live fast die young and leave a good looking corpse.  He did exactly that.  Funny SOB.</review>

This place will not last. I mean this in the most pessimistic way. It is a great dive bar, incredible location by the beach. The kind of dive bar you hope will be everywhere you ever go that is nice. And it will be forced out of existence. The lease will run out. And even if a landlord is sympathetic, money will win. Then we'll have another Starbucks or Jamba juice or whatever God forsaken chain place. Enjoy Turc's while you can. It is amazing, and something that you won't be able to experience 10 years from now.<//review>

A living piece of history that hasn't changed in probably over 50 years. A fun place where locals and tourist can grab a quick drink and enjoy some conversation in a quaint blast from the past conveniently located on the PCH.</text>

There's tons of great restaurants around the area that will make Rye the most natural choice for post-dinner aperitifs. I walked in to meet a few friends and was in awe of the pretty lights and sexy mood. There is a variety of seating at the bar and not. There's even an outdoor patio section.<//Review>< Resp>

< review>
My first visit to Turcs was on a Saturday night, and I enjoyed it. When our group of four first arrived there were only a couple other people there, most of whom were seated at the bar, so we ordered a round of drinks and retreated to the corner to play their oversized Jenga set. Several rounds of drinks later, and several rounds of Jenga (most of which I lost) later, we headed out. But the cheap drinks poured by friendly staff meant I came away impressed, and if I'm bar hopping in the area again I definitely intend to stop by for another round (but first I need to practice at Jenga).< /review>

<name>Michelle Araneta<//name><review>I've been here twice, the first time was great, the bartendress was fantastic. BUT I came a second time and ran into the worst bartender I have ever had the displeasure of meeting.  She was Asian and I still have no idea why she was so hostile towards me.

There was a man who worked there who was very friendly, in a good way. He opened up the pool table and gave us a free game. The parking is decent e tough and very close to the shore. Bartender was cute. Other than that it seems like just any old ordinary bar.</Text>

<review>The last chance for a cocktail in Sunset Beach. Also the best sound system for the Jukebox in town, as well as the only pool tables in town.  Nicknamed The Heart of Darkness, still a good fun place to go.< /review>< Pics>

This leaky sailboat of a place is good to grab a quick drink if you can get to the bar without being stopped by some old guy who's trying to tell you a story about when he was your age. They have three pool tables in the back, and a mellow little patio. On Wed night pool if free till seven, but good luck playing. You'll have to fight some old fisherman or rich drunk dude to get a table.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Great lil dive bar located near the beach! Full bar, two pool tables, couple video games, two indoor fireplaces and a smoking patio! Touchtunes for all the music you wanna play! They’re open everyday 11-2am. Friendly staff, happy hour Monday-Friday and daily drink specials. The building is over a 100 years old!</Review>

<Text>First and last time I will go to this place! Not gay friendly!! Bartender let people smoke pot at the bar.. And the worst part you cannot even get the drink you would prefer because they don't have bitters?? Come on!! Really! When I asked the bartender why people were smoking pot? She rudely responded " am I supposed to be policing the bar? Well it's your responsibility to know what's going on in the establishment during your shift.. especially when the pot is being smoked right at the bar! Felt sorry for her uneducated responses so I still left her a good tip! Note to the owner know who you hire and who you trust with your business! She may be hot, But lacks true professionalism as a barternder! Therefore turcs in my opinion gets 👎🏻👎🏻< /Text>< pics>

I think better tasting than Panda Express for fast food Chinese food.
Reasonable fast service and decent sit-down tables and some side options like soup and BBQ Pork Buns and egg rolls and cold drinks. The soup comes with the 3-item combo, a bit pricier Chinese food than fast food like Panda Express.

..PRETTY GOOD DEAL though overall.... the quality and taste is above average and the location in the nice residential area of MV-Los Altos close to good schools is appealing to families and kids and working adults in the area.</text>

They are slipping. Critical: Sweet and Sour chicken dish, their chefs used inferior chicken dark thigh bits (left over pieces of chicken) Gross!  Disgusting! Tasteless!  And Tough! Worst meal I’ve ever had from this place.< /Review>

In terms of authencity, the dishes are very very asian.

The decor is simple, but it attracts lots of local.  Most likely due to the taste and cost.

Strongly recommend to those who misses home cooked asian dishes especially tourists who crave for asian food.<//review>

Employees not professional, very small portions OMG, I'm a medium size guy that loves food.  The prices dont match the portions they give.  And the #1 reason I'm not going back is because the customer in front of me got larger portions and the customer behind me got larger portions and I'm not going to pull the race card but they were picking who they want to give 100% customer service.< /Text>

Food was good, but packed in a cheap,, clear container that melted from the heat and spilled in the bag. Food was okay, way too many veggies, very little meat.< /Review>

Great for a quick inexpensive meal. Almost was deterred by the mostly empty trays at the express counter but realized you can order fresh off of their menu. Glad we did. Will definitely be coming back.</text>

I've had lunch once a week here,  since 1999. It's very clean and the food is fresh, especially if you order from the menu. The Chinese chicken salad is better than any I've tasted in other restaurants.  The staff is friendly and the portions are ample too.<//review>

Great place to get good, cheap Chinese food. They serve good portions sometime a 3 item dinner is good for both of us! If you order the Pork chow Main to be prepared, it is delicious, much better than the regular one on the ready made bar< /review>

<Review>We arrived at a time in the evening wear the trays of food had almost been depleted and upon beginning the meal we realized that many of the entrees were cold. However the staff was very responsive, warmed up our food and we ended up having a nice meal. For the price, however, I would think a bit more awareness of those types of issues would be warranted.<//Review>< response>

<text>For take-out, this is one of the best in the area.  Is it as good as high-end restaurants?  No but then again it is reasonably priced "take-out."  The food is fresh, the people are friendly, and the restaurant is clean and bright.  I like their chow fun, my wife likes their General's Chicken.  All of their spicy veggie dishes are delicious.  I buy from them about once a week, and never any regrets.</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

It's our really easy and fast Chinese place to eat! The folks in there all know my family and practically know what to order for us before we walk in the door(they do for my adult son ();-)!!)
Have been going to this location for 20 1/2 years! Will continue as the food is consistently good and they always treat us very well! It's a treat to go there👍🏻love them!!<//Review>

<review>This is a solid Chinese buffet restaurant. It’s clean, the food is a decent version of the usuals (broccoli beef, pork buns, etc.), and the staff is nice. They helped carry our food over when they saw that I had my hands full with the kids. Being next to Nob Hill grocery store makes it a convenient stop before doing some grocery shopping.</review>< pics>

<Name>Anna Burns<//Name><time>1522970834312</time><rate>4</rate><review>A tasty take on express Chinese takeout. One of the few places that offers decent chow fun as an option other than fried rice or chow mein. They have remodeled the inside so the interior is very snazzy and clean. They do use some of the public tables to shell veggies but it's usually not very crowded. They have a couple of outdoor tables.

It is in a densely populated strip mall with a ton of stores. This is one of a couple of restaurants. Parking can be problematic because it is a very busy parking lot but they do have a ton of spaces.

Their food is quite tasty and they've been here a long time! Their best express table dish isntheir black pepper chicken.<//review>< Pics>

< review>
This place feeds  their customers old disgusting food and eat the fresh lean food themselves. I went there since its close to work. It was around 2 pm. All the food choices didn't look good but I was hungry and thought everything around here is almost the same so I ordered and $12 for a fast food lunch was fine. As I just got mt foid I saw the owners of the place, two ladies and two man who all are speaking Chinese  each  have a nicest, fresh  plate  chicken, vegetables on top of rice. I ask the lady who helped me that I like that food too.  She said no, this is only for us, you eat your own food. This was the craziest thing ever. Even one star is roo many for thus gross place. I give them negative 5.<//review>

<review>Fast Chinese food with a moderate selection of items and hot and sour soup included. Price for a plate is about the same as the Ranch Market 99 next door, which has more items and has more authentic and less heavy Chinese. Convenient bike parking right in front.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
HATED it... Absolutely DISGUSTING, unhygenic food.. I was starving and that was the closest place to eat. The food did not look appetizing, so I just ordered vegetarian food. 2 entrees for 8 something dollars. Learn the definition of an entree. They say one of the entrees has to be rice or noodle. I could not finish even 1/3rd of the plate. Not just tasteless food, very smelly too. If the vegetarian food was this bad, I can't even imagine how meat must have been.
DO NOT EVEN THIS ABOUT GOING ANYWHERE NEAR THIS PLACE.< /Review>

Garlic chicken heavy-handed on garlic and ginger, little of any other flavors. Couldn't eat, and I love garlic. The fortune cookies were stale and also inedible. For the price ($17 for small soup and 1 dish), I would expect cook-to-order dishes, not pre-cooked and served from a bin when you order.</Text>

<text>The store claims 3 item is $11, but one item must be rice or noodle. This is false advertising. 3 item implies 3 item + rice/noodle, and not 2 item + rice/noodle. Will not go again. Also not impressed by the food.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< rating>

<Text>This is the place where my first rifle was purchased as a young man. My dad loved to visit here and speak with the store owners and employees about different firearms and their ability to hunt. Various sporting-goods goods still carry many of the essential items that are needed for local hunting and fishing. They also sell a variety of beverages and snacks for your upcoming adventure</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

The gas station has plenty of room if pulling a trailer as it is pull through and large. They sell bait, beer, fishing and game licences and much more.</review>

Cashiers are friendly and helpful. Best priced  coffee, lattes smoothies... in town.  They have a fantastic selection of fishing and camping  accessories.  All that, plus beer soda,snacks and gas.</review>

<text>The owner proceeded to curse at me for parking in the wrong area, I mean yes I did park in an area I shouldn't have, but did I deserve to get f bombs thrown at me? I think not.. hes very rude and needs to learn how to treat customers, I would avoid him at all costs.. go to ampm or Chevron up the way.. at least you won't get cussed at< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

My first time here and it definitely won't be my last. I got the avocado & quinoa salad to-go and it was the best salad I've ever had in my life. Super filling, amazing flavors, and a nice little crunch too! I was trying to decide between this salad and the sophisticated salad. The super friendly cashier helped me decide on the avocado salad. She said both were great, but the avocado was the most popular salad and a safer choice, where as the sophisticated salad is more complex. Long story short, I went with the avocado and loved it.

All of the staff I interacted with were so friendly and welcoming. Everyone had a smile on their face and looked genuinely happy to be there.

If you haven't been to Mendocino Farms, GO! & if you haven't tried the avocado & quinoa salad, GET IT!</Text>

My Wife always talks about this place. She works at the studios and they would order food a lot here. Kept hearing about the "not so fried" chicken sandwich so I had to try it.
I had it with the bbq sauce and it was really good. Lots of flavor with the chicken, cole slaw and pickled onions, and the fried "crunch" in the sandwich was nice. Everything tasted fresh. Lots of good things on the menu, will have to try something else next time...< /review>

Modern farmhouse design and seating, great tasting healthy happy food in the middle of studio City! Awesome. Stop by and check it out. This is worth the stop for food. Not pricey as one might expect. Place your order at the front, you will be given a number pager and moved down the line. While there try a sample of their salad. Once you pay, find a seat and the food will be brought to you. They have a section for kids to sit if they want to play on there own. I like they have filtered water versus tap. I chose the chicken cobb salad with the dressing mixed in while my wife went with the turkey club on a pretzel roll. The taste was amazing. I was truly impressed.<//Review>

Wide selection of dishes on the menu. Can sample the sides. Had games and corn hole in the back. Great, friendly service!

Update: their Vegan Bahn Mi is to die for!!! Save drakes farm salad as well.<//review><userid>106202680347281095726< /userid><Date>1588278840170</Date>< Resp>

I love this restaurant for so many reasons. Their food is always fresh, always consistent and the variety is great!
Since I'm vegan I order either the impossible taco salad or the impossible burger queen.

It also helps that they offer free samples of the sides which are oh so good!

And they have beer!

It's a great place overall!<//text>

Their locations are clean and open, the food is fresh and delicious, the employees are polite and engaging but with that sense of urgency that makes you feel like you're in the middle of something exciting, even as a customer. Also, since we can only order out these days, it is important to note that their food travels well and is still fresh half an hour after being made.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Must try sandwich shop in LA. Vegan chili and non fried chicken are both amazing. Also if you are looking for some drinks after work, they have 5 dollar craft beer after 5;)<//review>

Cute, hip little place! Yummy-tasting bread and sandwich, but it was thick and hard to bite. Fresh ingredients. Wide selection of dishes on the menu. Can sample the sides. Had games and corn hole in the back. Great, friendly service!

Update: their Vegan Bahn Mi is to die for!!! Save drakes farm salad as well.</Text>

<Text>I love this restaurant for so many reasons. Their food is always fresh, always consistent and the variety is great!
Since I'm vegan I order either the impossible taco salad or the impossible burger queen.

It also helps that they offer free samples of the sides which are oh so good!

And they have beer!

It's a great place overall!< /Text>< pictures>

We were excited to try Mendocino Farms and found it to be a great newish place with an enthusiastic and friendly staff, and lots of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.

I had the blue plate special which was half a sandwich and my choice of sides. I had a caprese sandwich which was delicious and very fresh tasting, along with the beet and quinoa side, which was also great and included chunks of green apples (which were a delightful surprise.)

Our kid really enjoyed his grilled cheese sandwich (but he refused to eat the side of apples out of some kind of crazy kid-based non-sensical principle.)

My wife had the Vegan Green Goddess Avocado toast on gluten-free bread. She thought it was good, albeit perhaps a little too much was going on in the dish, so it was hard to identify specifically what was great about it. (It’s also possible she just wasn’t in the mood to offer too much of an assessment to further my agenda of being a crazy prolific reviews writer.)

This location offers both Inside and outside seating and it was very crowded on our Sunday afternoon visit, so we had trouble finding the table and ended up crowding together at a table for two. Ultimately this is the sign of a restaurant whose food is worth the visit.

We’ll definitely be back to try the many options available to us with out family’s various vegetarian, gluten free, and kid-centric diets.<//Text>

We stopped here on a whim. And we  were pleasantly surprised on how great our experience was.
We were coming from seeing the HOLLYWOOD sign from near the observatory to start our drive home ( north) . Traffic was gridlocked on the freeway  and we decided to sit at a restaurant and wait for it to lighten up .<//Review>

We eat here all the time! A little pricey but definitely worth the cost- the food is always fresh and amazing! I had an issue ordering online (they changed their deli side sizes from shareable to individual on the half sandwich combo) but when I brought up the discrepancy Zain was super friendly, explained the change to me, and offered to fix the problem!<//Text>

From the moment you walk in your get a very good experience. The lady at the counter helped us with many great choices that are popular among the usuals, they have us some samples of their delicious sides, and the meal was fantastic! Ordered a season Korean BBQ sandwich that was sweet, spicy, and was filled with a good amount  veggies to give the texture a nice crunch. Would definitely come back here again!</text>

Option right now would probably be order this had it delivered we get the whole process of like the delivery because if you guys wanted to rebuild a lot of them were about delivery and how long it took and how bad the food came for delivery so we can check that out and order it for delivery and start placing some orders here we could see all the prices for everything to seems like everything is normally priced nothing's like high chicken sandwich bundle which comes with coleslaw special sauce and two sandwiches and two sides only 1295 so like what can we really expect from like the quality of food you know what I mean it's<//text>

They have the most delicious sandwiches and just a great atmosphere. My wife and I always enjoy going here. They could use some work on there kid's menu though. My 5 year old was very disappointed in the quality of his grilled cheese sandwich. He didn't even want to finish it and he absolutely loves grilled cheese sandwiches. That's the only thing keeping this review from being 5 stars.</Text>

Mendocino provides fresh and well sourced food. This is one of the places that does a sandwich so well that I always get it even though I know the other menu items must be at least pretty good. So, if you go, I recommend the pork belly bahn mi sandwich with extra pickled radish and carrot.< /Text>

Ive tried other things and they were pretty good, but I would like to note that their salads are really awesome! This time around, I had the Sophisticated Chicken and Prosciutto Salad. It was so good!! A good variety of quality ingredients and a very tasty pesto basil dressing! Got mine on the side because I don't need much.</Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><resp>None</resp><review>The only reason why this place is not getting 5 start is because i feel their food isn't as consistently tasty as I'd like it to be.

Been to this location a few times now. They are always packed! Their sandwiches are always delicious. Sides for me are a hit or miss but overall, pretty decent. I haven't had a salad / soup here but I am interested to see what they are all about.The best part about Mendocino Farms is their variety. They have something for everyone. I will say, each of the menu items I have had are always well thought out. The flavor profiles of the ingredients pair well together, always.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is more modern with a variety of dining options. They do have some games and entertainment for kids / adults to enjoy while they eat and wait. There's always a buzzing, high energy you can look forward to. If you want to stay out of the hustle and bustle, take a seat outside! It's a nice, relaxing change from inside.

If you haven't tried it, I would absolutely give it a shot! It's worth it for a well made sandwich.< /review><pics>None< /pics><user>103987128977500601257</user></record>

The place I work at orders here all the time. For whatever reason, our online order never reached the store. Leah at the register and the manager, Jonathon, were absolutely wonderful! They fixed the problem right away, re-entered our $150+ order, and had it ready in twenty minutes, while also handling their lunch rush. The food came out great.< /review>

The best sandwiches, so good, so fresh.  We make it a point to go there, and they have these fresh unique sides that really make the meal.  Everything about this place is vintage meets a modern fresh approach to bringing a quality dinning experience.   No complaints here</text>

Really great sandwiches. Bread is awesome. We had a tr isandwich which was the best. The hot pastrami was awesome. The last sandwich was a turkey with avocado and bacon added on. It was great too!

I really enjoyed the promptness of the take out service, the quality of the food and how delicious it was, but I’d recommend a square recipient for their larger salads because the bowl it comes in is so deep that if you’re not careful, by the time you get to the end you’re only munching on the greens because it’s hard to mix all the ingredients in a deep bowl like that. I know it sounds funny for me to be focusing my review on the take out recipient, but if you’re in a hurry on your lunch break with no time to toss the salad elsewhere you’ll understand what I mean. This will not keep me from enjoying their salads or recommending this awesome place to others, but I just wanted to leave my suggestion. Maybe other people might have had the same issue. ;)< /text>

The food is always delicious and fresh, the restaurant is clean, and when people visit me, this is where I bring them to eat. I love this place and I’m so grateful it’s a part of my experience living in this neighborhood.

I went with a diverse group of people to this place. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. All of the people in our group loved their selections. Although it is a large, open space, we were able to pull tables together to accommodate our group and it was quite cozy. Even though I'm not a vegan or vegetarian, the "Impossible" taco salad was impossibly good!< /Review>

It is true that I paid 45 bucks for 3 sandwiches and 2 small packages of chips, but my goodness were it worth it! The Mendocino Farms sandwiches are so ridiculously delicious. My daughter and I also enjoyed playing fussball/foosball while waiting for our food.<//text>

Their deli sides are fantastic (I recommend the potato salad and curry couscous). With plenty of vegan and non-vegan options, there’s something for everyone. My go-to favorites are the impossible taco salad and the bbq tempeh sandwich. My roommate loves Mary’s no so fried chicken sandwich.<//Review>< Resp>

We used their website to order for pick up. We ordered the bahn mi sandwich, the Peruvian sandwich and the Cobb salad. Everything was fresh and delicious. The only drawback is that I wish they had more sides. But we will definitely check them out again.<//Review>

<Text>I really like the not so fried chicken sandwich and the potato salad is delicious as well.  I have tried the club sandwich too and it was also really good.  The bread is unique.  The fountain drinks are interesting.  I believe that they are made in house.  They are extremely foamy.  The staff is extremely friendly.  I keep returning because the food is really good.  Highly recommend!</Text><UserId.>102950877786789550031<//UserId.></record>

The underground parking here is unrivaled -- someone really thought this out.  The food is excellent -- salads, sandwiches, quick service and an all around good time.  I have always enjoyed eating at this restaurant. It is also especially family friendly.  I can bring my daughter here and she always finds food to eat that she likes.<//text>

All together very good.  Love their vegan options. Very organized, very fresh, and very good customer service.  The wait can be long when you call for pick up, sometimes 5 to 10 minutes. I end hanging up and walk across the street to order in person.  I usually call from my cell and turn it on speaker until someone picks up while I'm working... that way I don't get too frustrated with the wait time over the phone.  If try only would get more phone lines add hire another person to answer take-out. Other than this issue everything else is great.< /review>

Great place for lunch. They don't offer table service but rather give you a device to have your food delivered. Love their curry couscous and their healthiest salad ever (I think that's what is called).

I would only recommend management to cut down the use of single-user plastics.<//review>

This was my third time ordering from them. Previous Avocado in the salad was a healthy green and looked ok. Today I ordered and got a salad with a nasty black avocado on the top, which I discarded. Cannot find a customer service to complain so am posting this review.< /Review>

The first time I went here I thought it was okay but I went to a different location last week and I was so impressed!  I ordered a salad instead of a sandwich -- maybe that was the difference.  It was so big I could only eat half.  It lasted  two more meals! And was delicious.  It had so many different ingredients from prosciutto to cheese and olives -- everyone was so helpful and kind to give me boxes (I took it home in two!) I would definitely come back here.<//text>

For months now the locals of Studio
City have been waiting with bated breath for the new do over of the old Mc Donald’s.

This February MENDOCINO FARMS opened in the Trader Joe’s parking lot to much applause!!!
This is the perfect 👌 lunch or early dinner spot. The lines move swiftly with precision. The menu , mostly soup salads & sandwiches ,is fresh farm to table.

I’ve tried the Fried chicken sandwich twice and a variety of salads. All delicious.
The only drawback is they do not sell coffee . But a Blue Bottle is opening next door shortly they say.
The servers are happy and helpful.
This is DEFINATELY a well needed and joyful addition to the Studio City dining landscape.
Great for to go also👍</text>

Never disappointed by the food at Mendocino Farms, but if you're health-conscious, you may want to check the nutrition facts online before ordering. The Not So Fried Chicken Sandwich ordered as is racks up over 900 calories.</review>

Turkey is not stuff you'd buy sliced at the deli, it's real turkey sliced. Like Thanksgiving. It's a lot of food too and I left very full. Potato salad not awesome - tastes too much like cold mashed potatoes and I wasn't a fan. Doesn't mean this place doesn't get 5 stars from me though bc sandwich was so good.</text></record>

I've had Mendocino Farms bookmarked for a while now and today I finally had the chance to try the place out.

Their menu consists of sandwiches and salads and they offer vegetarian/vegan options. You can enjoy your meal with a beer or wine! Today I ordered the Ham & Gruyere Grilled Cheese on wheat bread and it was delicious! I highly recommend it! Don't be turned off by the "grilled cheese" aspect, as it is far more than just that.

All the staff here seem super happy and friendly. Very welcoming establishment and cozy as well. Will definitely return.</Text>

<GmapID>0x80c297d2ea010c53:0xb2d85151e35bbaec</GmapID><text>I wanted to take by buyer client out for lunch. We come here a lot and it's always consistently good. My favorite sandwich is the chicken-prosciutto sandwich, which had a pesto-like sauce. The latter was a different touch, but I have to admit, I liked the crunchiness it brought.  My client ordered  "The Hot Italian" and requested it to be panini pressed. He said it was delicious, a combination of different flavors, spicy, savory salami, the sesame bread, all combine to form a unique taste.  Thank you Mendocino Farms for a good experience!

The potato salad and the couscous are also both super good if you want sides. You can do half and half for sides also if you can't decide which ones to get!

Service is always amazing, and food comes out super quickly. There is parking in the back for free and there is also meter parking. Love it here!<//text><resp>None</resp></record>

A little on the sweeter side for my taste, but always high quality and friendly service.
Be prepared to wait if there's lots of orders coming in, because they take the time and care to cook your food.
Staff is very helpful on choosing menu items to account for food allergies.< /Text>< Pictures>

sandwiches here are tasty and solid.  i always end up going for the pork belly banh mi.  very flavorful and a good lunch size.  the vegetables are crunchy and fresh, and the pork belly is cooked well with good seasoning or marinade.  the panini bread could be a little hotter but that’s a niggle.

deduct one star for their setup which is an efficiency nightmare.  a person stands at the entrance and takes your order and has to go into excruciating detail explaining the ingredients in the sandwich (which are listed right in front of you) and then you walk down a ramp to pay.

except they have a stand/mini-deli counter setup with their sides and another person asking if you want to try free samples.  which holds up the payment process.

love the food but call ahead and order and skip the line and pick up your food at the other end so you can avoid the dissertation on the ingredients and the sample counter.

oh, and most of the time the person finishing your order at the phone order side will give you the soda for free.<//Text>

Their menu consists of sandwiches and salads and they offer vegetarian/vegan options. You can enjoy your meal with a beer or wine! Today I ordered the Ham & Gruyere Grilled Cheese on wheat bread and it was delicious! I highly recommend it! Don't be turned off by the "grilled cheese" aspect, as it is far more than just that.

All the staff here seem super happy and friendly. Very welcoming establishment and cozy as well. Will definitely return.< /Review>< Pictures>

Absolutely love this place. it is located on Ventura blvd. at a section were it is not impossible to find parking, even on an evening during the weekend. The food menu reminds somewhat of Lemonade, which is fresh-farm-to-table with a very creative and tasty take on a lot of items. Food ranges form farm raised braised chicken sandwich to pork belly, multiple salad and vegetarian options, and plenty of really good tasting lemonades. Definitely try to check it out if you are on the neighborhood or looking for a place to launch during the week!!< /review>

Really good sandwiches and very consistent. I think the ordering process is comically bad, but the restaurant seems to think otherwise....not a reason to knock down a star but there may be a chance you'll be waiting in a line out the door. Moves quick though!<//Review>

<text>This is one of my go-to, easy places to eat. I should probably branch out, but my favorite is the Lemongrass Steak Bhan Mi sandwich. It's consistently good. My husband's favorite is the Italian Love sandwich.

Supporting local farmers, fresh ingredients, great service, amazing food, variety of sides and sandwiches to choose from! Can’t go wrong here. Thanks for the great food and atmosphere - I would appreciate more veg options but I can always find something here.

Curried Cous and Pesto Shells will always be the OG top faves.< /Review>< GmapID>

Ordered food online at 1:20pm, was supposed to be ready at 1:39pm. 1:55 rolls around food is not only not done but "my order wasn't printed" or some other excuse. They also charged me twice, I checked my bank statement as I waited. It took them an additional 20 minutes to refund me. I will check later to confirm my money was returned. No apologies no customer service. The food is good and the staff are usually on point but this experience was unacceptable and I am now going to work on an empty stomach and very frustrated. Thanks for wasting my lunch break Mendocino.</review>

I used to love this place.  I'm so sad that it's gone so far down hill.  Today i had my favorite salad.  I won't go through every change. Suffice it to say that used to be a succulent and delicious key ingredient in the flavor of the salad - the thick maple smoked bacon,  was so over cooked that it tasted like charred cardboard.  It destroyed both the taste and the texture of the salad.  I was very disappointed.  The staff is still wonderful.< /Text>

Decent salad decent price, they didn't toss it or deliver the bread I asked for and when they did it was plain bread, not toasted like I had asked. Hence the 3 stars.</Text>

<review>When you walk in, you go to the back of the place where there is a big menu on the wall, and an employee with a tablet to take your order. Well, there were customers standing there trying to figure out what to order and chatting with the employee while a line was forming. We couldn't even use that time to figure out what we wanted because those employees were blocking the menu. Once our turn came up, I ordered the vegan burger as recommended by the employee. Meh. Didn't think it was anything special considering that it was $12. Nothing stood out flavor wise, and wouldn't order it again. Also, at that price, throw in a bag of chips or potatoes or some small salad. There was just this lonely burger. Wouldn't go back.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x80c297d2ea010c53:0xb2d85151e35bbaec<//gmapID><userid>115151365280953024559<//userid><Rating>1<//Rating>< user_name>

<text>Pretty much every sandwich on the menu is amazing but my favorite is the pork belly. I'm also a huge fan of their natural soda fountain drinks. It's usually packed so finding a seat during lunch can be difficult but its worth it.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c297d2ea010c53:0xb2d85151e35bbaec</Gmap_id><user_name>Christopher Abbott< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Good food as can be expected from Mendocino Farms, but docking a star for not having a men's bathroom.  They have a women's restroom and a unisex restroom but no men's!  What the sexist!<//Text>

We stopped here on our way north for lunch. The staff were very friendly, and the food fantastic. I got the vegan bahn mi, which I was a bit wary about since I am very particular about tofu flavors. They knocked this sandwich out of the park! So, so delicious. The bread was totally killer, and the flavors were spot on with just the right amount of spice. We will definitely be stopping here again!< /review>

<Text>Variety of choices for sandwiches and salads. Personally enjoyed the Steak BLT and the Pork Belly Banh Mi. If you're into sandwiches with great bread I'd highly recommend. Great service too! It's an order and sit type of restaurant addition to servers providing refills and other needs. Amazing vibe and environment.< /Text>< Pictures>

All I have to say is get the Slow and Low pork sandwich. I went three times in one week. There must be some type of drug in there that is compelling me to go so many times.<//Text>

Yeah yeah it’s all fun and games, custom-made sandwiches and gourmet food, but I find myself spending a bunch of time just looking and discovering and pondering what I want, and when I finally get my sandwich, it’s almost never what I expected. Quality is good and place is nice and techs, but I find it a little pain-in-the-ass for some reason. It could be me, or he place. My two-cents.</Text>

Best sandwiches in town! Pork Belly Banh Mi is always a personal favorite and the salads are awesome as well, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Oh yeah, love the curried couscous as well. Food and service are consistently excellent so I just keep coming back. Simple as that. :)

Side note to staff/proprietors: Please bring back the muffulettas! :)<//review>

<Text>My boss orders salads for delivery all the time and raves about this place. OKAY, now I get it.  The place was super busy and packed, but seating was available.  Ranged from people on there lunch breaks, seasoned citizens to a group of moms each with their baby strollers trying to manuever through the dining area.

Since this was my first time here, i wasn't really sure what to get.  They offer a seasonal menu, along with their classics and favorites, as well as vegan options.

It's set up cafeteria style and you order with the hostess.  I asked for a recommendation and the hostess suggested the Peruvian Steak Sandwich.  I was concerned it would be smothered in cheese, so she suggested light cheese.

Near the cashier counter they have fresh made deli items, like pastas and slaws that you can sample.  As I passed down the line you can see all the food being prepared and I noticed some delicious looking bacon bits.

We met Matt, the manager in training.  He came over to say hello and asked if we needed anything, so we asked if we could have a sample of that bacon?  Not only did he give us the bacon bits, but he also gave a us a little taste of some mouth watering make you wanna slap your momma Pork Belly!!  SO GOOD!

The hostess was spot on about my sandwich!! It was so tasty,  you'll see in my pix what's left of my sandwich when I finally remembered to snap a shot.

My co-worker ordered the Modern Tuna "Almost Melt" sandwich with dill pickle potato chips.  I'm purdy sure the sandwich was really good since she wouldn't let the staff take her finished plate because she wanted to eat every crumb and for a second I thought she was going to lick the serving tray to get every morsel of food.

I noticed after that they have a Blue Plate Special which I'm excited to go back to experience other items.  I'll keep you posted of what I discover.

Enjoy!</Text><date>1524628468011</date><Name>Samantha Sanchez</Name>< Pictures>

I'm not a huge chain guy, but this place totally rocks. I love their sandwiches (especially if it's served on a Pretzel Roll.)

The atmosphere is borderline cheesy with twists of hipster and farm decor. If you've dreamed about ever have to sit on an Astroturf bench, this is your spot! I just tried the Carved Steak Pretzel Melt and it was tasty! I also liked their Vegan Mushroom Barely soup. You also have to try their Iced Tea!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
This place has decent food, but the dumbest system I have seen in a long time.  If you are putting in a to go order or any order for that matter, you put it in with hostess. So the line is out the door and the small entry way is crowded with people. Then you move to another counter where you pay, but here yyou can try different salads to add to your order. So now the two employees behind that counter are trying to take money and give you samples. Nowncones the wait for your to go order.  I waited half an hour for one sandwich.  Lesson learned, always pre order for quickest in and out.  Staff is friendly.  Atmosphere us nice. Food is tasty. But what a crappy time.<//Review>

Favorite lunch time or quick dinner spot — best staff and service out of other nearby locations. The Avocado Quinoa Salad and Banh mi are staples.< /text>

I've been the West Hollywood location previously but this was my first time going to the location in the Valley in Sherman Oaks. I'm not a huge chain guy, but this place totally rocks. I love their sandwiches (especially if it's served on a Pretzel Roll.)

The atmosphere is borderline cheesy with twists of hipster and farm decor. If you've dreamed about ever have to sit on an Astroturf bench, this is your spot! I just tried the Carved Steak Pretzel Melt and it was tasty! I also liked their Vegan Mushroom Barely soup. You also have to try their Iced Tea!<//Text>

Can we all just pause for a moment and discuss what just happened to me?? That sandwich was outrageous. Like unbelievably good. And i got a healthy one. Nm when i come back for the Peruvian steak or the bbq tri tip. Like seriously, what just happened? And i had a beer on the patio. And it was lovely. And on the way out i saw their soda fountain, too cool! I'll be back for sure</review>

Went there tonight.  6 people ahead of me horrible system you have. 1 person in the front taking orders as people walk in.  The 2 people in the front of the line kept asking questions on different items they couldn't decide, 1 of them was on the phone reading the menu to the person. It held all of behind them up.

With a few tables and a bunch of workers it took them about an hour for  2 sandwiches that were ordered more than 20mins  prior. Won't come here again<//Review>
