A great show.. Especially for the price. They just got their liquor license too. It is a cute little theatre with an intimate setting. You can hear everything in the peanut gallery, so the audience gets very involved. Big bang for your buck, all of my friends really enjoyed it. Thank you for putting on an awesome show!!!< /text>

Luckily we found this comedy show on google. It's great value for the money ($10) as we laughed a lot. We'll recommend this one to friends and family for sure.< /Text>

Comedysportz LA is such a fun time, they have the best comedians. Each game is played with family friendly laughs and specialized with Improv games. I highly recommend checking out CSZ LA and make sure to bring the whole family!< /Review>

Perfect for all families, comedy fans, and friends out for a night on the town. Fast-paced and vibrant, the performers of Comedy Sportz bring alive an improvised comedy show built from suggestions given by the audience. The short-form structure (short games, scenes, and competitions) means that you could even walk in late immediately be brought up to speed. The performers are some of the most seasoned and passionate in all of Los Angeles. You can feel that everyone there loves what they do. Every weekend they bring joy and laughter to new fans, come join them!</Review>

<review>This event/show is the most fun your family can share together.  Audience participation and lots of cleverness dominate this unscripted show.  Every show is different so weekly attendance will not get boring.  Put it on your schedule.  Always family friendly and reasonably priced.  GO!  You won't regret it.</review>< pics>

This is a fun theatre! The show was great. Be prepared to volunteer to participate! That was a great experience for me, I did sound effects and my friend played four square. All the performers were great and the host was delightful.< /Text>

This is the only comedy club I have found so far that is all "clean jokes". Perfect place to bring your kids with you.

I love their improv, all the performers are very talented. They offer classes too!

No drinks minimum required. They do sell drinks/snacks at the back of the theater. Nice seating area during intermission.<//review>

Quality, family friendly improv shows! I take classes and work here, so I'm biased, but this place really is like a second home. All the players are so warm and welcoming, so you feel like you're a part of a family even when you're simply attending a show. It's a gem that more people need to discover!< /Review>

Excellent improv. I went there because I'm taking improv by one of the members, Bill Chott,  to see him in action. I wzs not disappointed! I loved the show! And not many improv incudes live music and narration!  Tickets are cheap too. Parking not great,  but then that's LA...</text>

<review>We have seen many shows at The ComedySportz Theater and have always left there with our sides aching from laughing so hard! We have seen the College Team matches, The Professional Team matches and several long form improv shows. It's hard to say which is our favorite. Chickspeare, the Resistance, and Manor House Manner are all hysterical and fun. Everyone is friendly (and funny), and the actors come out after the shows to greet the audience. They are amazing! We order our tickets ahead of time to save a couple bucks.  A night out at the CSz Theater is really a hoot!< /review>< pictures>

<review>Took a wonderful boat tour on a naval raft craft. Warm, fast, and fun. Guide was a local and showed knowledge of the general area. Took his time to explain history and other events. Enjoyed seeing all kinds of birds, seals, pups, otters, etc. He even recommended a choice of restaurant a located at the Port San Luis Pier pier.< /review>< Pics>

We went to see the sea with Michael at SLO Tours! Michael was awesome and very knowledgeable about the area and sea creatures. It was during the month of October so he played music in sync with season. I thought my teens were going to think it was boring but they had so much fun crashing the waves. We will definitely be back!

Thanks Michael for the great sea experience!<//text>

We had the greatest experience today whale watching from Avila Beach with SLO tours. Michael was an awesome Captain and you can tell that he is passionate about whales. One whale was so close that it hit the boat with his tail. The boat was fast and felt very safe. It was great to have the inside cabin to stay warm on a chilly morning, yet you have plenty of room to wonder in the front and back of the boat. Thanks Michael for a  fabulous time.<//Text>

This was our first boat ride and we had so much more fun than we anticipated. We have nothing but high expectations for future boat rides because we truly had an amazing experience! We will be returning the next time we are near. Stop here and book this one! Breathtaking views, funny conversations, and exciting speeds!
We went with a small group & we all had the time of our lives.< /Review>

When he says in the description on his web page that he goes FAST and it's like a roller coaster he is not exaggerating at all. If you're an adrenaline junky you will love it. If you get anxiety easily like me, you won't.  FYI we were airborn!!< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Rating>5</Rating>< user_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>What an amazing experience for the whole family! We took a whale watching tour with Capt Micheal at SLO Tours and saw tons of dolphins, bird life and several humpback whales! Micheal was an amazing captain and made the experience feel so fun and safe at the same time. It was the perfect way to spend the afternoon and everyone on board was so excited about the whole experience, ages 7 to 60. My older brother, who’s normally the serious macho guy, still smiles and says how cool of an experience it was for him. Definitely a 5-star must do on the Central Coast!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80ecf858270aff81:0xbc87880dfb857924<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Mike gave my family and I am amazing tour! Even after warning us of foggy conditions he skillfully was able to locate a pod of 4 whales which we were able to follow for over an hour as they fed. Besides the whales we also saw many harbor porpoise, pelicans, otters, seals, and even an 8 food GREAT WHITE SHARK! We were very fortunate, but even if we saw nothing, just being on the water and jumping waves on the ex-Coast guard boat was a blast.<//Text>

If you are in the area or even if you are not make this happen! This made our trip so incredibly special, Mike and his whales are not to be missed. His knowledge and expertise is second to none. The coastguard boat was awesome, exhilarating and fast wasting no time getting you out among the whales. Out of world experience, I can’t imagine having done this trip any other way. Back in England now and still stoked looking through the photos and videos re-living our time on the water. All is left to say is thank you Mike for sharing this experience with us.< /Review>

We would have had passed San Luis Obispo if it wasn’t for friends who lived there and we’re so thankful we stopped by. They introduced us to SLO Tours for a morning whale watching session and within minutes of leaving the harbour we encountered our first whale! Content with this, we went on to see more feeding which was incredible. Being in a small group it was the perfect setup for whale watching. Grateful to the Captain and his knowledge of the bay and generally treating us so well. Highly recommended and happy to support a local business. Thank you< /text>

Such an amazing experience! This was truly an all around thrill ride. From the speed of the boat zipping over the water to my awe at getting SO CLOSE to SO MANY humpback whales, this experience was everything I could want it to be. We saw three whales lift their heads from the water no more than 25 yards from our boat! I traveled with both of my children (ages 10 and 5) and Michael was a very knowledgable and accommodating guide. My youngest child sometimes gets carsick so I gave her half a tab of Dramamine and she had a blast with no nausea. If you're on the fence about this, go for it! This is a whale watching experience like no other!</Text>

If you want a whale watching adventure or just an exciting ride around the harbor I highly recommend SLO tours out of Port San Luis pier in Avila Beach. This is our second time going out with Captain Michael Brink and we will definitely go again.  This is not a slow trolling experience - It is a very fast ride on a coast guard Zodiac style boat, but I felt totally safe the whole time (and I can't swim!).  If you sit outside prepare to get quite wet (exhilarating), but the enclosed area is perfect for those who prefer to stay dry.  Captain Michael is amazing at navigating to where the whales are hanging out.  I'd like to take his Ocean Rafting tour as well to explore the coastline and enjoy the roller coaster of a ride.  It is really worth the price to book with SLO tours.</Text>

<text>I went on the tour with Capt. Michael off of Port San Luis. I saw at least 8 whales and got some really good shots. The weather was great, the boat was comfy enough and the Capt got our group to whales and other wildlife in only a few minutes. I really enjoyed this excursion.< /text>< Pictures>

Old town car wash was great. Diffently recommend grabbing a rag or two before washing your vehicle. The price isn't bad for vacuums, wash and vending machine. FYI only the wash accepts credit cards. Add a like if this was helpful<//text>

<review>Nice little wash - 5 bucks for 8 minutes each. They have 4 stalls and 5 vacuums. Bring some terry towels to dry your car. My only complaint is it can take up to 20 seconds to switch between the different type of washes, which makes it impossible to do a decent rinse, soap, scrub, and rinse in one cycle. But other than that can't really complains as it is a nice wash</review><pics>None</pics><rate>4<//rate><user>102374954625703530230<//user></record>

<text>This is an amazing little car wash. It has 4 stalls to wash your vehicles and 6 vacuums to use. There is a gentleman that is always there. I'm not sure if he is the owner but he keeps the carwash spotless. I absolutely love that the machines take $1 and $5 bills!! Their levels for soap, tire and rim cleaner, wax, etc. are always stocked up! I personally think this is the best little kept secret around town!!! I highly recommend you try Old Towne Car Wash!!! I give it a 10/10!!!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>115996607692050463258< /UserId.>< rate>

Machine worked great.
Its ok if you come during the week but not on weekends only has 4 bays.
Area was clean. Did not smell or have gross puddles. Much better then the automated car washes. They never get the hard stuff out.< /text>< gmap_id>

Very well located and managed RV park, we stayed in our 40' motorhome and to walk downtown Napa was .8 miles. We also biked the Vine trail to Yountville and back.<//review>

<text>Several large buildings are located in this park setting. The grounds are large enough to accommodate several different events at the same time. There is a large grass field for playing sports or an outdoor event. There is an outside stage, large sculptures and parking lots and roads throughout the grounds.< /text>< Rate>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Staff and food here were great. The prices for the bagel were on the cheaper end, but the bagels themselves were delicious. They also had coffee a available when we came in even though it was later in the day. I'd highly recommend the Jalapeno-Asiago bagel with cream cheese. Hope to come here more again next time I am in San Rafael!</Review>< Pictures>

Been coming here for years. I always have the same meal when I come here - fruit salad, a boiled egg, and a sesame bagel with cream cheese. Delicious bagels, I recommend!< /Review>

<text>The food isn't bad, worthy of visiting, if it weren't for the absolutely rude and discarding staff that can be expected with each visit.

It's bad enough to fully negate any positive experience from the food. Unless you want to interact with a staff that have a propensity to throw a curve at an otherwise good day, I'd recommend avoiding any visits here.< /text>< Pictures>

Very disappointed. This is the second day I have come here both around 10/11am (not too late in the day) to find a very poor bagel selection. I mean come on??? you're a bagel place??? have a decent variety?? all the plain bagels were sold out, leaving gross strawberry and chocolate chip bagels no one wants. why not,  I don't know.. make MORE plain bagels and normal flavors  if that's the demand, which it clearly is seeing no one touches the other random flavors. seriously. I never write bad reviews but this was extremely disappointing considering the fact I took time out of two days to drive 20 mins to bagel
street cafe all to feel extreme dissatisfaction. definitely not going to
make that a third time, and i know I'm certainly never going to try again. got highly recommended which is quite unfortunate.</Text>

I go here all the time! Great lunch or breakfast spot owned by some great people. You can’t find a better bagel breakfast sandwich in SR.<//Review>

This is my Go-To place for a quick lunch. Love these guys! They work hard, always have a smile and make a very good sandwich ... quickly :)
Growing up in Brooklyn made me a bit of a bagel aficionado - they do pretty much the best job in Marin (and most of SF!) Give them a try ... start with a California Club on a dutch crunch roll. Yum :)< /review>

They have excellent large and fluffy bagels which are superb for bagel sandwiches.  The staff are very friendly.  The location is clean with a unisex restroom.   Overall, the value here is excellent.<//Review>

Any candy I had in mind it was there, their hours are awesome and thank you for sticking to your hours. (Had gone to a store closer to home and even though they said a specific time they were not open) and talk about their prices wow!!! People were nice too and they take credit card. Definitely gained a new customer will recommend to anyone that is looking to buy candies for their parties. The store is a good size too!< /text>< Pics>

Super cute candy store in the Ravenswood neighborhood. Everything from licorice to speciality chocolates. They even have ice cream (though I haven't had it yet). The prices are a little high but I feel like you get a hardy portion for the price.</Text>

(Translated by Google) It's great to find a place that is selling authentic Mexican candy and products. I easily go here about once a month & the employees are always so nice, never fail to live up to that.

It is a good place to find authentic Mexican sweets! You also have other products from Mexico. I go easy once a month and I have never had problems with the attitude of an employee. They are always so kind and charismatic.

(Translated by Google) Good quality of sweets with the exception that some candies are blessed and a man of legal age who pursues one throughout the store.

<Review>Best home-cooked Cantonese food in the area. It's further than most from my home, but well worth the extra 5 min. drive. My favorite dish is the Singapore Fried Noodles with shrimp, pork, chicken, etc. I don't like food that's too spicy, but these folks cook the hot dishes with just enough spice and offer extra chili sauce if needed. Owners are friendly and food comes out quickly. I've never waited more than 10 mins. The eat-in dining area is small, but comfortable enough. Best to call in and pick up. The portions are generous, and three dishes usually lasts me 2-3 days.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Food is decent. bang for buck is decent, but talk about stomach pains... also don't ever try to get avocado smoothies. I have tried 3 times now and I ask every time if they have avocados to make it, and if not I am more then happy to get a different one... each time the answer is the same "yes we have it!" And for some reason each time I get a honey dew... there both green so I guess they taste the same. Looks like I am gonna stop going here over a smoothie.<//review>

Customer service here is top notch especially the lady boss/cashier. I've been a few times and she always has a sweet welcoming presence. She might be the sole reason some people frequent this place because she adds such a highlight to anyone's day.
The food itself is quite tasty. Typical Chinese cuisine, the usually well seasoned but I did had a very bland order one time I came. The portion sizes are great and the prices are quite cheap.
The restaurant usually isn't very crowded n tucked away in a business Park so it's a nice place to eat with a large group or even just sit in for a bite alone. No need to feel pressured to drag along a buddy. I reccomend giving this place a try if your in the area looking for some convenient Chinese food.< /Text>

The food is great! However the service has room for improvement. Still, been here more than a handful of times and was here to celebrate my lunch with coworkers. Their chicken tikke is really good as well as their tandoori chicken. Also cant praise their fried fish with whatever sauce comes with it.</review>

We came across this restaurant while we were on a long drive across California. And to be honest this place was a pretty random pick, as we were super hungry at that point (when we found this joint) and were willing to stop at the first Indian restaurant with half decent reviews.

So all that considered, we were quite lucky that this was actually a pretty good place with really tasty food. We ordered Tandoori Fish Koliwada & Chicken Biriyani here, and both those dishes were delicious.

Though I've to say that the Fish Koliwada was nothing like we expected a Koliwada dish to be. Because traditionally Koliwada is a fried fish preparation and this was baked. So that was a disappointment, but the fish still tasted good, so overall it was okay.<//review>

Food is so good.  I love the Mandovi Indian Cuisine. Sometimes delivery can be slow but it's worth the wait! The manager Martin is super nice and goes above and beyond to make sure their customers are happy.<//Text>

I placed an order for delivery. Food was good but little expensive for quantity I got AND they didn’t put any paper plates or spoon or fork anything with it not even napkins, that was little disappointing.<//text>

<Text>They have a lunch buffet with a good selection of dishes. Their spice level is definitely a little higher, but absolutely perfect for my taste. And the spice is in just about every dish (just the way i like it)! They have both vegetarian and non vegetarian options for food.</Text><user_id>118177861796040841683</user_id>< pictures>

<text>Pricey and busy, but get the COCONUT RICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

went to this place on my bday and it was small and crowded, but I loved it. The food was tasty and the portions were generous. They look small but are filling. Watch out for the $38 four course meal. It can be confusing because the way it is written on the menu it looks as if it means $15 for a four course meal. Again, not a big deal and we just overlooked it. I would def. suggest this place!!< /text>< pics>

< Review>
We have done mostly take out from here as they keep the lights too bright so ambiance is not quite to my taste.  The food is generally very good with ample sized portions.  We especially like their Chicken Tikka Masala and the Baigan Bhurta.  Dal is kind of watery, but flavorful.  Service is always very friendly.  I recommmend it for South Bay beach city residents.  There is nowhere else to go to get non-fast food Indian in the South Bay, sadly.  They don’t deliver (have to use for-pay delivery like Grub Hub), which is unfortunate but understandable.< /Review>

<Text>There isnt an option to rate with negative stars?Worst experience with Indian food EVER!!! Recieved these 3 little 16 oz containers of food for $60 dollars?! Half of which was just sauce. They did not even include any rice or even a simple piece of naan bread. WOW. Extremely over priced for basic quality with miniscule childrens sized portion. Would NEVER RECOMMEND anyone to try this place unless they enjoy wasting their money. Just a sad experience over all.<//Text>< pics>

Very consistent.  I come here almost every trip to LA.  Food is tasty, but it takes a while to get served.   Lunch buffet is good, but sometimes they struggle to keep it replenished.  It's a staple for me, and I enjoy coming here.<//Review>

I recently moved from New York to the Los Angeles, due to my love for authentic Indian cuisine I would drive to New Jersey for it.  When I got here in El Segundo I dreaded eating Indian food because of the lack of the authenticity. But OMG when I visited Mandovi Indian cuisine it is the best in Los Angeles. I drive 45 mins just for their dishes.

Sai the server is extremely polite and professional very attentive and patient.

I rate this place a AAA and  a 5 star place</text>

<Review>When I came back to LA, Mandovi was the first restaurant my boyfriend and his parents took me to...the hype is well deserved, this is the best Indian food I've had in Cali! Very tasty, light crispy fluffy naan, rich and flavorful curry lamb. My mango lassi was thick and rich, it was the perfect accompaniment to our main course. It was my first time having shev papdi chat and the bar is set high! A fragrant and spicy blended street dish - delicious.

Assistant manager Sai made sure every need was attended to, that our food was prepared to perfection and is wonderful to converse with, he treated us like family and welcomed us at the door. I look forward to returning soon and will definitely recommend to others! Wish I could give 10 stars.< /Review><Name>Larissa Lowthorp<//Name></record></dataset><record>

So we accidentally spotted this place while driving towards another indian restaurant... we decided to try it out and I've been to over 20 of the so called best indian restaurants in LA... literally, but none of them are as good as Mandovi, Ashoka in Artesia is 2nd but Mandovi has the best lamb, goat curry, great fish dishes, saag, nan etc.. I've ate and heard many patrons commenting how great the food is....

Service is great, the two guys are nothing but stellar, they go out of their way for you and are very helpful.. definitely some of the best service I've had at any restaurant in la ...</text>

Came here during lunch time, so I got to enjoy their buffet. Great food and great customer service but not much selection for being a buffet. Again, great food but not enough to have me come back.< /text>

The lunchtime buffet is always wonderful! Many selections to chose from, the butter chicken is delicious as is the tandoori chicken. They change up the menu daily so there's always something new to try. The food is so fresh and looks amazing. I really love this place!</review>

< Review>
Exotic Goan cuisine ,i bet u might have to literally search  in Goa for such an authentic cuisine .
Great friendly service ,clean environment,presentation of dishes were mind blowing.
I was impressed with the food taste ,Freshhhh ,u can never find a restaurant in Minnesota  or for that matter any other place in US we visited.
Went again for Buffet next day ,awesome selection with all food freshly  prepared
Thanks for having this restaurant .< /Review>

You get good options for veg as well as non-veg food. Since I'm a veggiesauras, i can only comment on veg food. From snacks, to main course to desserts, i like em all. Although desserts could have more choices, so far, we had same options in desserts on every visit.

Visited yesterday aling with 12 people. They charge 18% service charge, but when they know number of people above 6 gets to pay service charge by default, the service standards becomes lowest. Saw other people being served(who are less in numbers and tip is to be earned) was pleasant and heartwarming.

Why service was poor? Sir, that's a new servant sorry.
Why naan was cold? Sir, it just came off the oven.
Why it doesn't say anywhere about 18% service charge? Sir, it is what it is.

DISASTER.!!!!!!!!!!<//text>

I personally visit the restaurant and HALAL certificate is display inside the restaurant. They serve buffet and quality is ok. I like fish fry most in the buffet and they serve only from Monday to Wednesday.

And also we catered the food, we order tried CTM, PTM, Chicken Biryani and other veggie items but it was not bad but I like veg samosa though.

I recommend this place but not necessary you will like everything in buffet.< /text>

THIS IS THE MOST REDICULOUS WORST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!! i ordered mild chicken tikka masala and when i got it it was extremely spicy i almost threw up. then i ordered another one and complained about my experience. they then charged me for that one and it was still very spicy. the third one i got was still super spicy. my family did not enjoy the taste of their food from her and we will never go here again because of the awful quality. we love indian food and this was the worst i have ever eaten and the worst service we ever received!!!<//text>

Wait time was ridiculously long.  Food was horrible.
Only 3 people were working and we're moving here and there with no sense of direction.  Seriously.....if you open a restaurant you need to have the basics covered for good customer service......senseless and pathetic.</Text>< user_id>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Worst restaurant I have ever been to. I ordered food for pickup it was good so went to the restaurant the next day with a group of 6. A couple of us had buffet where they won't fill the food if the dish was empty, even after paying $11.95.

The worst part was we ordered food for Togo and we tasted food there in the restaurant. We ordered medium spicy food and the biryanis we got were extra extra hot. I usually eat spicy food but wasn't able to eat even a single spoon of it. We asked them why it is so spicy and to our surprise even after repeating three times about wanting for medium spicy level food, the person has taken the order as hot. But it's not even hot it is extraaaaaaa hottttttt. I can't stress how hot it is. I eat hot food in Thai restaurants without issues, but this one was 10 times spicy than hot spicy level food.

To add to it we order for a vegetarian curry(egg plant) and ended up getting mutter curry or something which had only few mutter pieces in some very spicy gravy.

The customer service was worst that I have seen. They didn't do anything and were busy cleaning their stuff even when I said we are not able to eat it.

I would never recommend anyone to this restaurant.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Unique and really tasty. Not just another Indian restaurant to get your tikka Masala fix. This has really unique flavors, and amazing sauces. I will be back for more. I'm just not fond of the incense they have burning inside the restaurant, and their cabernet Sauvignon. Other than that, the food (and customer service) was very much worth my time and money.<//Review>

I ordered tomato soup which was quite good, Kashmiri malai kofta was pathetic, it was like rubber balls which would stretch but won't break into bites.
Nan was ok though. Overall not that great.</review>

<Text>Good food, especially the pista orange kulfi was awesome! make sure to order it, that too give some time for them to prepare. The kulfi is made on pieces of orange!

The pappad (cracker) is on the house so that is good.

Tried Miramar Sev Papdi Chaat which was good (might be bit filling so ensure you have enough people in your group so that you can finish your entree). Tried Goan dishes - Vegetable Caldinh  and Black Eye Peas Ros and both were good. slightly on spicy side.

The server could have ensured to fill water regularly especially after giving the check!

Might be priced bit on higher side!<//Text>< pictures>

< review>
Tried their buffet early this week. The owner of the place reached out to me on my last review and said that he will revisit his buffet options. Went back after a few months and buffet options are changed they have their house special chicken biriyani in the buffet and also bhel poori as starters.

The biriyani was goo and the naan was fresh. The service by the staff was pleasant. Weekday buffet was 11.50 and is worth it.

Will go back again. Good and fresh indian food options. Hope they will stay that way for long term< /review>

<text>miss Teresa's Mosaic Cafe, but Mandovi is pretty good too.  Overall the food seemed a little bland, but it is a LOT better than Indian Summer in El Segundo.

The butter chicken was my favorite dish at this All you can eat spot.  Even with the funny texture to it.

I like that it was fast to get in and out of this restaurant when you're short on time during lunch.  Naan was good too.

The chicken tandoor was okay.  The saag was spicy, but I didn't get too much of it since I like saag paneer more than saag with potatoes in it.

Parking is not too bad.  I would come back.< /text>< date>

Mandovi Indian Cuisine specializes in cuisine from Goa, located in Western India.  Goa was colonized by the Portugeuse, whom heavily influenced the culture & taste of the region.

I attended a special weekend lunch buffet, which is normally available during weekdays only.

There was a myriad of offerings beautifully displayed on the buffet line.  Selections such as-

Tandoori wings & fried fish

Biryani rice & curry puffs

I brought my appetite, having 3 loaded plates of spicy deliciousness

The highlights for me were the butter chicken, fried fish & biryani rice.  The butter chicken was tender & buttery rich.  The fried fish was flaky w/o being oily.  Lastly, the biryani rice was fluffy & moist.  I didn't mind loading up on carbs on this occasion.

Don't forget the desserts!  I satiated my sweet tooth with kheer, fresh fruit & chocolate dipped strawberries
The health benefits of strawberries w/ the pleasing taste of chocolate.  A romantic way to feed your tablemates ;p

For an additional charge, my table opted for ghulab jamun
Fried doughballs doused in syrup, these are a great way to bust your diet.  Sweet & pleasing to the tastebuds, the ghulab jamun are not to be passed up.

Service was great.  We were promptly attended to, with our drinks being refilled & plates being cleared whenever needed.  Plenty of table seating for large or small groups.  Parking is in a private lot shared by The Boat, Togo's and other businesses.

We all left with full bellies from Delhi.

Mandovi Indian Cuisine offers authentic Goan cuisine that'll spice up your day.  I live very close to Little India, so I normally frequent restaurants there, but if I was in the South Bay area, then I wouldn't hesitate paying a visit to Mandovi for some spice-laden chow.

Highly recommend!

<review>I come here all of the time and always satisfy with their customer service, but I have a huge issue with their staff not fixing the cash register. I've waited almost a half an hour before I can make my order until the sandwich artists told me at the last second the card machine was broken. I would have understood the first time, but this has happen many times in God knows how many years. Not only that, but the artists always have trouble using the cash register, which makes the wait even longer.I even told the manager a few times to get it fix and to tell them to train their staff properly. It's become apparent that they don't care about that issue. I know it's not a huge issue, but at the same time, it's an easy fix. Please fix your register and train your staff to put in the orders right.< /review>< Pics>

<review>I used to love this subway I would eat here maybe 3 times a week. but now when I go my sandwiches are always soggy, and slapped together. And I know it's supposed to be quick but you can at least stack the meat so it's not falling out every where. There's was one person there who seemed like she enjoyed the customer service aspect of things but now she's gone and when I go in I get met with rolled eyes, and smacked lips when I have *special orders, or rushed along even if I'm the only one in line.. the service I've received here used to be good but now. I can't say too many good things, other than it's just another subway, you get what you pay for.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>To the gentleman who worked on 01/03/2020 (the closer) i was very disappointed walking up to your door and being refused service before your posted time of close. I barely got off work, just hungry and you told me you couldn’t help me.. because you were already closed, which was a lie. I really hope you learn customer service. ☺️ Cause you just lost a customer. Or a few.</Review>< pics>

Subway has great subs, wraps, soups, and cookies on the menu and you can add extras to any them. New owners, but they're learning fast as they do have someone hired from corporate to help out for a while.< /text>

Well just visit was not a very pleasant one it started out good and then the moment that I said I was paying with my EBT attitudes of the clerks changed and then they told me I could not purchase certain food items with the EBT when other Subway's let me for some reason this one was different and I don't think it was different I think the staff was just discriminating against me because of Meijer EBT status< /review>

<Review>After changing to different company ownership, Terrible customer service. Extremely rude, il temper, and unprofessional.

I came in with an issue that need solved right away. The front desk employees whispered to each other, saying don't deal with this, just throw this to the side. How irresponsible and unprofessional.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>This agency is a hands off until their needed for issues with their clients. Trying to keep up with your worker is a  bit tedious at times and they often change with out notice. But if your independent and resourceful the environment is optimal. If your in need of an hands on agency and someone to guide you through a tough and long entry process( I waited seven years) then look else where. Overall this agency is a great fit for anyone trying to move or relocate in San Francisco's extremely tough rental market for the low income individuals and families.< /Text>< pics>

I don't think this agency is very responsive to landlords. I manage buildings that have several Section 8 tenants and Section 8 has not paid the rent subsidy for one tenant for the last two months. I have been trying to get this resolve for over a month, by contacting Section 8 four times, but to no avail. It has been virtually impossible to get staff on the line to discuss things-multiple phone calls and emails go unanswered. when I did get a response: staff will look into it.<//text>

No stars for this. Specially if you deal with the inspector Marvin Harrell, he always has an attitude towards management or owners and hold the rents even it's a minor repair and make it a big deal. You  can not get a hold of any supervisor in their office to try to resolved and complain regarding this guy who thinks he's God!!!!!  they deserve negative stars !!!!!<//review>

I live at the Empress Hotel . I have been living here for 10 Years. It's a SRO. I sign up for the moving on incentive. I received the 1st Letter a Month after i sign up , that I was on the waiting List, 3 Months go by & I received another Letter thats said" CONGRATULATIONS " You have an intake appointment on July 12  at 11:45  am please bring these documents ,Birth certificate, Social security card, Bank statements & Drivers License. I went the day before my appointment in basement of City Hall. So I went there the day before just so I knew where it was . The day of my appointment i was on time & I had all the document's. When I arrived there was a note saying WE MOVED. On that day I took time off work , so I headed back to Work. When I got back to the Empress Hotel the case manager said " they told me you were not supposed to receive that letter !
So I called Kanesha Roach . She was the Person they directed me too when I explain what happend. Kanasha Roach was very rude ,, She would not let me finish talking & she hung up on me. People that do this work knowing that the person that there working with lives in a Building ran by the department of public Health. Kansesha Roach was unprofessional. Did not answer my question & was extremely RUDE ! Someone is going to have to answer for the mistake, You can't do this to People or you shouldn't a courtesy call would have been nice , kanisha Roach  have no heart & let me just hang not knowing what happend.</Text>

<Text>Hello,

I am writing because the SF Public Housing Projects, which I was born and raised in San Francisco and that is my hometown. The way SF has become is pushing blacks and browns out of San Francisco. I know what San Francisco is as I was there in 1966 when a police shot and killed a 16 year old boy and the people of Hunters Point Bayview were treated badly. Now San Francisco has become a white city and I see a lot of people in San Francisco and I look them in their face and I know you are not from here. The rent has risen and buildings are being build everywhere! Wow! The history of Bayview Hunters Point is gone, there is hardly no history of San Francisco. I am a Child of God and I pray daily, for the savings of God. We need Him badly. Also the money people work and make in this 21st Century is truly no real money as the government takes all your money off your checks, that is so sad. Why if you have been living in the Projects, your whole life why do these people who are not realness, think that what you make is a total lot???? If you have a child/ren, a family member that has always lived in that place and who is on SSI and being taken care of by family member who lives together, always have. If you are working and make say $40,000.00 a year, that does not mean you are rich. That is rent, taking care of your child/ren, working, food, bills, clothing. Why would someone working for SF Housing Authority ask you for your taxes, when you have showed your check stubs??? I have never been asked to see my taxes, and never was. Every two weeks out of your check the government takes all of your money, me up to $500,00 from each checks. What gives the rights to people who work for the projects to harass you, with this? If this was from the 1980's all the way back then you would consider your self rich, now everything in San Francisco has gone sky high. What is wrong with the  Mayor Lee who allowed people from states, countries to come to San Francisco and make SF go sky high?????? I do want the world to know as God has told me there will be the biggest earthquake ever that will be coming, if there are a none believer, then that will be their faults, not the believers of God. I will begin to write letters and stories of what is going on in SF, that is the hometown of those that was born and raised.  The Revolution Will Not Be Televised!</Text>< Gmap_id>

<userid>106322224587700644233< /userid><review>This office is highly unprofessional many of the staff and workers have very nasty attitudes! They are not helpful and the tone they speak to clients in is awful and disgusting! The Housing Authority in San Francisco needs to be reported to the Better Business department!
They said I would be on hold for one minute and 20 minutes later I am being spoken to roughly and with no respect just for simply trying to figure out what I should do because my landlord goes out of town for a month I give hint rent money something goes wrong he isn't here to fix the issue so I have to pay out of pocket (which I can not afford after paying him his rent and every single bill) and the lady spoke to me as if because I am on section 8 I am some bottom feeding bum!
They need new staff that actually cares about the city and the people in it, that have proper people skills, intelligence and class and who know how to leave all nasty disgusting attitudes at home! If you can't be professional why do you work in customer service with the public?
The work place is not a place for this disgusting behavior! Truly sisickening and I am still waiting two weeks later for a worker to call me back</review>< GmapID>

<Text>I'm an Army war Veteran. They help veterans process rent vouchers. Currently they only have ONE person processing vouchers for all of San Francisco County. It's been 3 weeks processing, the landlord has chosen to rent to another tenant instead! WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!!< /Text>< user_name>

I think that section 8 is not section 8. Not like it use to be. They calculated my rent to be $1204 and the bmr price was $1599....SMH... You do the math???? And now that I dropped 1 income I want to see what they say now???</Text>

Pretty big and has various machines. Weights are all over the place and unlike other LA fitnesses where the staff walks around putting them back, I've never seen it happen here before.  They have a juice bar where they do smoothies and pre/post workouts that are actually pretty good.</text>

I like to go in and out, no fuss, just get straight to business and get out. I've been training with Victor and I'm really enjoying my sessions, he's friendly and knows exactly what my goals are.

The facility itself is pretty clean, the locker room is typical; lockers, showers, and whirlpool. Sauna and pool are co-ed and clean as well.

They have several classes for all likes. Their app is really user-friendly and their class schedules are always up to date.

Good luck trying to find parking; it's always full especially when there's a class.<//Review><time>1583613268424< /time>< Name>

Its pretty large facility but always packed no matter the time. You have to fetch your weights since they're all over the place. The Zumba classes are always packed so I assume they are good..< /Text>

I love working out at the gym. The gym kinda nice but no sauna and the parking is bad and one of lady here doesn’t allow me to bring scooter inside because the looker is smaller than other gym. My other friend went there three weeks ago. Kinda unsafe area for me if I don’t drive</Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>Do NOT get a gym membership here. Parking SUCKS. Do not be fooled by the big parking lot.. you will find yourself circling around the entire lot with 20 other cars and you will not find a space. Gym always soooo packed. No cloths for cleaning the machines or mats (NASTY), and don’t be fooled by the size from the outside, it is SMALL inside. People always have mats along the halls because nowhere to go!! I have skipped so many floor workouts due to space, and missed workouts because of the parking. So NOT worth even the rate that seems affordable. you’re squeezing next to 500 other people. Nowhere to workout without people facing directly as you. Lots of wandering eyes. Can’t wait to be out of contract.</Text>< Pictures>

One of the largest LA fitness locations that I’ve ever been to but it’s equally as crowded.  Cleaning is also lacking.   No hand sanitizer or solution to wipe down equipment.  Management needs to do better.  We pay a membership and deserve a baseline level of service.<//text>

<Text>It's a great gym but everyone that works out here needs to practice and train to put their weight back on the racks or at the weight stands not all over the floor or by the machines they're using  I've almost tripped over some. staff should be politely asking to have members be more responsible for that. Accident prevention is a must not to mention is cleanliness.<//Text><response>None< /response><Date>1549203287187</Date>< Pictures>

<Review>My worst experience at LAF. The gym itself is pretty standard with good equipment, but the people here have zero etiquete. Dumbbells never racked back up and several people hogging 3 sets of dumbells at a time. I know it’s not LAF’s fault per se, but they could definitely try harder to educate their patrons. I’m not coming back.<//Review>< pics>

This gym has a very friendly and welcoming environment which encourages anyone to work out! The equipment and machines are always clean and there is always something to do!

And when you find something that you love, you naturally share it with the people around you. Due to that, 8 of my friends got memberships and of those 8, 3 signed up for training. Candin didn't sell them training, he listened, understood and offered them their dreams, as he did mine. He gave me the knowledge that it took to get from point A, to point B. I write this as a thank you, not to LA Fitness but to Candin.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJQNvG2t7SPHmc3cAaw-8jrqQ4TPMgMFbqHql_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwh8DtbJC0pu9OpWpBm6fSbep_ScAsT6iUlWFf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

Great place to work out. They have plenty of machines even when the place is full you can find other open machines to get that workout done. This him looks small from the outside but the inside is really big.<//review>

I love LA Fitness's services and I've been to a few locations. This location is super dirty and good luck finding free weights. Bathrooms were filthy and most toilets were clogged. I wont be visiting this location again.</Text>

<Text>This is the first review I have written, but I'm honestly very disappointed with LA Fitness. When I signed up here for the first time, I was lied to in terms of payments and refunds. I have been trying to terminate my membership for the past 3 months and have been unsuccessful because to terminate your membership, you have to go in person and talk to a manager who is only available M-F 9 am- 6pm. Unfortunately, I leave my house at 6 am and don't get home until 7 pm. I called multiple times, spoke with multiple people who said it had been taken care of, but it was not. Additionally, you have to terminate your membership 10 days before the billing cycle otherwise they will charge you. Once you do terminate, you will have an additional month of membership that you are forced to pay with your first payment (I was told I could get this money reimbursed when I signed, but this was a lie. If you are told this,  do not believe them). Regarding the services, when I went to meet a personal trainer,  she was not with me at all. She was on her phone the whole time, and I did not get much or of it. The gym is not kept very clean, and there are scarce cleaning supplies (towels and cleaning solution). The hours are also limited. I honestly got more out of my membership from Planet Fitness, where I got to work with an attentive personal trainer. I hoped I would have a good experience here,  but it was a very frustrating and disappointing one.<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
The worst LA Fitness. Most of demographic who flock there have no respect for the weights or gym etiquette. Equipment is always hard to find or in mediocre condition. Always busy.
This gym has the heaviest dumbbells of the Downey area LA Fitness’s, the most squat racks, and the most benches. Other than that I try to avoid this gym at all cost.
Lived in Downey for three years testing out different LA Fitness.<//Review>

<Review>This gym is honestly only good because they stay open a little later but till then it kinda sucks some of the equipment is damaged. The people that work there are arrogant except for maybe 3 workers. But till then everyone else has terrible customer service. Worst of all are the sales reps. A friend and I went to work out once and one of the sales reps tried to talk us into giving him money under the table so he can let my friend in as a guest then tried convince him to putting in other people numbers because he was “helping us out” letting my friend in. This place really needs to train their staff or get a better one.<//Review><user_name>Gildardo Garcia< /user_name><user>101250601831084684792</user>< pics>

One of the best LA Fitness gyms around. The only one that is always open late weekdays or weekends. Good pick-up basketball games in the mornings or evenings. Only complaint is the customer service from some of the staff but can't blame them when there's virtually a revolving door of employees every few months.< /Review>

Top 5 worst LA Fitness I’ve worked out at. This Gym is just gross. Free Weights are literally all over the gym everywhere, except the actual weight racks where they belong I Spent 10 mins searching the gym trying to find the matching pair to the weight I wanted to use.

The means bathroom was just disgusting. Toilets that needed to be cleaned, toilet paper everywhere, and liquids other than water on the ground.

I’m sure these complaints are more reflective on the people who use this gym vs the people who work here. Everyone that works here that I’ve run into have been nothing but friendly and helpful, so I challenge management to police their gym better!!!<//review>

Staff is useless and sit around all day. Weights are left everywhere and fungus was found in the showers. Pool looks gross and It is unregulated... members do what they want. For the monthly price you will literally be better of and safer at planet fitness. Machines have missing attachments such as handles, ropes and the bars on the benches are the incorrect type for benching. Overall. Very hazardous and no one cares.</text>

I agree with everything the review below states is true and correct. Also the "new" gym equipment sucks. I use to go there back whe. The old equipment was there and it was a lot better equipment.  Now you have to take your own handle bars/ equipment because they do provide it on the new machines. So not only do you have to buy your own equipment handle bars to use on the machines but your also having pay your monthly fee that they shuld be providing all the equipment for you to use.< /review>

Personal trainer manager Syvana is a scammer. She will lie to you to get you to sign up for the training again. The only reason I stayed is because my trainer is amazing. Fernando is the best trainer.
I am not the only one who feels this way. All the personal training customers feel the same way. They take advantage of this Latino community because our people don’t know anything about contracts. Everyone talks about how Syvana lies and how she is stealing their money. She always talks about how this gym has the best sales and it’s because she lying to get what she wants.< /text>

Place it's OK but there are no staffs around to guide you on the use of any equipment, unless you pay extra for personal training. And even though they trained you on a specific area and don't guide you on the equipment. You have to learn on your own. So I feel it too expensive for that reason</review>

<Text>I only come to this gym because its the closest Gym population is acceptable compared to other LA's near me. The weights are always scattered and very difficult to find a matching pair. Its a decent gym, would be much better if the people working out would try to keep it clean and neat.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2cdca0d4ab14f:0x75a7395e89a1f561< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This gym is so gross. No one EVER puts their dumb bells away so they're just laying randomly throughout the building and you have to search the whole place for them. It's every day and it's absolutely infuriating. I know that's on the members but it's like they don't even know you're supposed to put them back when you're done.
Also there aren't enough paper towel dispensers and the one by the cardio equipment is always empty so no one cleans their machines when they're done.< /text>

They closed late on the weekends, good work out equipment selection.  They just need to keep the bathrooms clean, I know is the dirty ass people with no manners.
But is still the facility job to keep it sanitized.< /Text>

<review>Dont bother trying to redeem a vip guest pass here because they will try to get you to buy a membership before you even get a workout in they dont want to hear what you have to say.
I am going to be added to my sister's account but i had to wait until the first because she had recently removed someone so she gave me a pass until i could sign up well Alex did not care he just wanted me to buy into a new membership because it was convenient for him and not what would work for me and he lied said he emailed the guest pass but he did not. We did not sign up with him so he could care less what more trouble we went thru after that visit</review></record>

Gym is big however it was a mess. Didn't even bother with using the free weights when I saw how disorganized everything was. Management should really focus more on mataining the facility a bit better<//Text>

Theres alot of equipment here to use compared to other gyms Ive been at such as YMCA, but I have to give it three stars because its a pain when its full here on weekdays and that happens often and also on how the restrooms are maintained. They are disgusting. They are not even mopped properly, they are just hosed down and left without drying. So if you want to use it, prepare to have your shorts wet. I try to use the restroom before leaving the house but sometimes I have to here. Not to mention how disgusting some people leave the stalls. Used toilet paper next to the toilet is not acceptable, I may be able to accept a few on the ground, but for the janitors not to pick up after maybe 30, 40 on the ground?!?! Its disgusting<//Review>

The reason it's not 5 stars is dumbbells are always allover the place since people can't seem to lift the weights back to the dumbell rack and staff is always trying to keep up to the movement and mess the people make. It has a pool and alot of treadmills doubt they ever get filled up but I've never been here during peak hours.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2cdca0d4ab14f:0x75a7395e89a1f561< /gmap_id>< Pics>

I would recommend this place for the reasons it is one of the places that opens really early and closes really late. It would have gotten 5 starts if it wasn't for someone taking my stuff as I looked away for a minute and people seem to not find that person at all. Luckily I didn't lost anything important. Don't come if you don't have a lock for the locker and keep your stuff inside. There are 2 hot tubs one in the guys locker area and the other for the wemon locker area. There is more than enough showers best place for cardio workout and classes.</Review>

This gym is really dirty. They also put a tile in the lockers that looks dirty, I guess so people can't tell clean from dirty. But I assure you, it is dirty. Weights are mostly out of their racks.   Alot of people here in peak hours. You get what you pay for. It's really cheap.<//Text>

<Text>A/c doesn’t function well when it’s fixed, a lot of damaged machines that never get fixed, way too crowded, you must hunt and horde your weights and machines is the motto, no one believes in sharing cause they usually have 5 FIVE sets left 😂, very bad gym etiquette in general feels like the bad etiquette is just the perpetual culture of this place.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The worst L.A. fitness.  It always stinks in the locker room and the staff won't greet you, talk to you (unless you're a stripper or a new member)  I hate this place but it's convenient when visiting my family.  This place has been like this for years.  I even witnessed a customer in the locker room wearing just his towel upset because he took a shower and they robbed all his belongings and took off in his car.  Left him naked and with no transportation.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2cdca0d4ab14f:0x75a7395e89a1f561<//gmapID></record>

I called to speak with the operations manager so I could update my home club and was told I had to do it in person so I came in. I was then told she was on lunch so I had to wait 20 to 30 minutes. After waiting they told me I could come back if I wanted to and talk to her on the phone since she likes to take an extended lunch so if I wanted to wait another twenty minutes. If I could just have done it on the phone, why make me come in and waste my time for no reason. In the end, apparently, she couldn't honor the change either so waste of time overall.< /review>

Not only did the sauna smell. I drove from Pasadena over 30 miles to this place so afterafter 5 min i was there  they kick everyone out from the sauna. Its barely 10:30. I  this to the cleaning lady to allowe 10 more min. She rudely refused. I am so upset  I called before to make sure their hours were  open until 11and they had a sauna i can use  until 11. Poor management and they don't care about the people thatthat actually pay for this gym. Very stinky sauna too so howhow is  cleaning so important and customers who pay can't do their training. This place is a joke. I dunt see the cleaning even beingbeing good ifif it stinks so bad.<//text>

I used to go to Planet Fitness but i could never get any free weights and had to wait a long time to get the machines i wanted. I rarely have that problem here. The only times I do struggle is when i go at peak hours, but even if there are no free weights there are plenty of machines and treadmills.< /Review>

<Text>Beautiful place but poor management
Not enough machines for all members at times, too crowded.
Canceling membership will be difficult, so make sure you do it in person at your loca Gym so your credit card don’t keep on getting billed.
Talk to manager if you think you need some help ;)
she is super polite even when you are saying goodbye to the service. I’ll give a 5 star to her “only!”<//Text></record>

<review>Disgusting!! This is a health code violation! I have been a member for over 10 years
And I remember when the quality was fair. I need to swim for my back problems and the Jacuzzi and pool are just really dirty. Foam turns black and gray in the spa and people don’t rinse before jumping in the pool after a workout. This creates bacteria people!! The bathrooms used to have plenty of toilet seat covers, towels and toilet paper but not anymore.
It’s a shame to live so close by and my friends and I have to drive farther for better overall quality and management.

Don’t get me wrong people, I know it can’t be perfect but this is just wrong and not worth my money. They even had to shut down the pool area once for decontamination.

This is a great division in the fitness world but if I were a stake holder I would not be tolerant of such lack of customer service.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

The floor is scattered with random equipment and weights. None of the staff seem to pick anything up unless they have some sort of higher up management here. It's just a mess.

Terrible customer service!!! My fiancé and I got turned down from this ratchet-looking sales lady, she denied our FREE GUEST PASS, because he had one from another location, when they clearly let us know that it can be used at any location. After all, it is a FREE GUEST PASS. We wasted our time & gas just to be turned away! Ended up going to Planet Fitness for the night, where we were treated like royalty compared to LA Fitness!</review>

<text>My main complaint is that they don't clean the equipment at all. If you touch the treadmill, your hands get stuck to it and you stay sticky. I have to bring disinfecting wipes and wipe the handles before using the machines. I usually get there at 7:30 AM and there isn't a lot of people there so, it's not like they've been used a lot by the time I get there. They simply don't clean them.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The gym is ALOT better now after the renovation, its huge and has many machines but still gets packed around late afternoon, also people never restack the weights which is extremely annoying to me and some, but they are trying to enforce the rule now. But overall a good solid gym and much better than before.< /text>

Less attitude from the loafers at the pool. Kind, understanding, more educated people at the pool, than the gym (LA Fitness) at Downey Landing.
Opens at 4:30 a.m. during the week?! :) sorry employees:(< /Review>

This place sucks! They charge you 29 bucks a month  for equipment that doesn't work. That's why I closed my account, this place is bad don't waste your time and money. I have talked to the manager and he told me, if I'm unhappy for me to look elsewhere... Bad customer service!<//text>

Over a year going here they don't really invest in new weights , they need Dumbbells , curl bars,straight bars, and just more weights for Olympic bar especially 10s .. Best la fit near by is in montebello but should not have too go that far..too PACk. from 8 to 11am and from 3 to 9 pm< /Text>

Very difficult to lift weights. All of the racks are empty and you have to go on a mission to search far and wide every time you want to change weights. The weights are scattered around the floor in disarray. Its so crowded that you cant even complete one rep of a workout without being asked five times if you are using a dumbell or barbell next to you. I absolutely hate it here! Id rather drive 30 mins. To work out. This place sucks!</review>

Dont Sign up with these People.
If you decide to Cancel, they will Ignore you and Keep Charging, then if they cant get Payments, they WILL Harass You.

I had to go through my Bank and claimed a Fraud Activity and had to put a Block on them. Now they are Calling and bugging me saying they cant process my payment. I keep telling them Why and say GOOD, I'm Glad you can't. Then they will call me 3 times in one day. So they Must have a Crappy computer system since they can't take notes like, The Person Canceled His Membership.</Review>

They have absolutely no weights and when ever I bring it up to customer service they use the excuse that the weights are just scattered everywhere but in reality they don't have the weights. Patrons that use the gym are also very lazy and don't re-rack there weights.</review>

Really nasty. The water fountains are pink with salmonella. I've asked them to clean it a few times before, they say they'll clean it themselves. next day, nothing has changed. They should close it down if they can't clean it. I don't get in the hot tub, but every time i walk by theres a layer of brown skin. Must be in violation of a lot of health codes.

Plus, theres an open house like every weekend, or every other weekend. I regret getting my membership, i could've just gone to every open house.<//Review>

Very unclean. Toilet paper everywhere, no shower curtains, dumbbells are never reracked, same equipment since the early 2,000’s.
There’s hardly any sanitation stations, cable pulleys out of order, several machines broken and it is stuffed to the edges with people.
I would avoid this gym at all cost.<//review>

Give them one star because can't give nothing. Restrooms and dressings always stinks. If you arrive at 8:00 you must wait for a space at the parking for even 20-30 minutes, its always full. When I signed Salomon Real (sales service) told me I have 6 days to test service and can cancel at anytime. It's one week since I've decided cancel and they can't still cancel my membership. They need 5 minutes to register and more than a week to process a cancelation. Dirty place, bad customer service. Really ignore why is always full of people. There are plenty of better places to workout in Downey.<//Review>

If you need a gym for a short period of time e.g. visiting the area...not the worst place..my two complaints would be to hire someone to pick up the weights or enforce the rules.Plates  and weights are scattered all over the gym and people that use them are too lazy to put there weights back. Its impossible to tell if someine is using dumbells because they surround workout areas. Some people act like its their garage gym and they take possesion of 3 to 4 sets of dumbells and when theyre done? They leave all sets right there on the floor. please provide paper towels and spray bc most people at this gym dont bring their own towels and leave equipment driing with body fluids. Its disgusting .< /text>

I was formerly a member some years back. Got done with college and after settling back home, I wanted to start hitting the gym regularly. Went in with a week guest pass asking the front desk if it was redeemable.

Front desk guy instructed me to wait. Next thing I know, I am greeted by a sales rep and escorted to a table where she seemed very excited about trying hype me up with her questionaire despite the guest pass in hand.

She then followed by offering me what sounds like a regular multiclub membership without initiation. I mentioned that I had hoped to eventually sign onto my parents plan. She proceeded to write it off stating that I would need to put down the initiation and the offer she seemed dead set on was only a few dollars difference. I countered stating the difference would be about twenty-four dollars every year. She merely glossed over the matter in transition stating that the offer ended that day.

I realized I was being pressured into a subscription. I was miffed, but I had also considered going straight into the subscription. I conveyed that the only thing keeping me from joining then was that I start a new salaried job the following month and despite having a payday on the tenth, I might not expect to have the funds until around the twenty-fifth. She glossed over that and seemed to only hear that I get paid the tenth.

I was again miffed, but realized everything due this and next month would be manageable. I started giving the pushy lady information and even swiped my debit card. She wanted me to sign using a digitizer, but her desktop app did not seem to pick the digitizer. She panicked, asked for help, and ended up rebooting the machine. That app still did not register the digitizer. She proposed along with a co-worker that I redo the transaction which would charge a separate quantity and freeze the same amount for about two business days.

I was still miffed and in declining the separate charge, gave her a chance to figure the situation out. Her co-worker starts to urge me to process a separate payment using the promotion's conclusion as pressure tactic. I lost all patience and stated that there are other gyms while gathering myself to head out.

One of worst experiences I have ever had at a gym or business. Reps made no attempt to propose a better alternative or slight compensation as a gesture after wasting the better part of my hour. Will speak to manager on Monday. If I cannot reach a suitable outcome, I will have to settle for Planet Fitness. Hate Planet Fitness's culture but I believe I have more than overextended for LA Fitness.< /Review>

<review>There are two reasons why i don't like going to this gym. Reason one,The Staff. The staff here tends to only care for new comers. Once they realize you don't have a membership their eyes light up and all they see is a dollar sign on top of your head. once your all signed up they basically act as if your not there and the majority of the employees seem like they're there for the paycheck and nothing else. Out of the 100 times that i have gone to this gym i have only gotten a hello or good morning once, yes thats right one time out of the 100 times that i have been here. The customer service here is bad and it is certainly nothing to brag home about. This is my representation of how the employees there act. Here it is. All of the male employees who work there walk around like they are some hot shots with 10" penises, with their noses way up high in the air, and think they own their own oil companies and are racking up billions of dollars every year. The female employees think they are super models and have their own clothing lines and also bring in some million dollars every year. the sad thing is though that none of these la fitness employees know a single thing about customer service. Second reason why i decided to give this place a single star rating is because of the weights situation. Having to get a decent workout is such a pain because you can never find the weights that your looking. You have a better chance of finding all 7 dragon balls in 5 minutes than finding two 25 pound weights in the same amount of time. Every time i find a bench that i want to use i find myself having to go looking for wights because they are missing from the racks and by the time i return to the bench that took me forever to get someone has already taken it. This has happened to me twice. I remember going to an la fitness in Long Beach CA that was not as big as this one but their weight organization was immaculate. i remember that i ironically put away a weight in the wrong spot and an employee immediately came by and put it in the right spot. That made me feel like i was paying for a $500 gym membership instead of $29.99.
This La Fitness in Downey is pretty big and they have a lot of machines but the only draw back i think that keeps a lot of people from coming back is the sucky customer service and the lack of weight organization which is pretty important for someone who just wants to get a quick work out and head to work right after.
Other than that La Fitness you guys need to seriously pick it up or you guys are going to lose a lot of members if a different gym near by ever opens up.< /review>< name>

This gym has it's good and bad side. On the good side, this is probably the best equip LA Fitness in town. They have everying you would want in a gym from a deadlift station to Naultilis equipment along with heavy punching bags. it does get crowded so you need to schedule your workouts early. They do need to replace their baebells. Most of them are warped.</text>

<Text>all the dumbells were scattered all over so it sucked  trying to workout on dumbells. some equipment was not working. overly crowded even on saturday. this was my 4th experience there an on my 5th time I walked in an went to the back where all the weights r an hardly no dumbells on racks so I walked out an went to the other LA fitness off lakewood in Downey. there weights r newer an less crowded. it's smaller but for working out with weights. it's way better< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Where do I start. First let me say that this was one of the one of the better gyms I've been to. Ariel the sales rep (hopefully I spelled her name right) helped my fiance and I sign up without peer pressuring us. She was very sweet and made the whole process of joining easy and fun. This location isn't even a yr old yet so i don't understand why the ratings are low. Maybe everyones experience is different. The equipment and machines are new and theres not just 5 or 7 machines there's plenty for everyone to use! This place has two levels: upper level= Cardio and Lower Level= Free weights, Arm, Leg, & Core machines, locker rooms etc. I personally enjoy the pool. It's clean and the water is always fresh. The women's locker room has a jacuzzi as well as the mens. Highly recommend going to this gym!!<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

This gym has gone down so bad,machines are always broken, very dirty and they smell horrible the sanitizer  pump is empty most of the time so machines can't at least get wiped down.. Need major improvement on maintenance and house keeping so the machines can be on point.< /Review>

<Review>Employees don't do anything to upkeep the gym! Everything is dirty all the time. 80% of Treadmills don't work properly.The gym Equipment is never disinfected!! ------------------------------------------------------BE CAREFUL!------------------------------------------
STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS----------------------
What is it?
Staphylococcus aureus, commonly known as staph, is a bacteria that mostly causes skin infections.
Symptoms-
Staph infections are usually mild and include superficial rashes, pimples and/or boils on your skin. However, if the bacteria spreads and gets deeper into your skin, it can become a life-threatening infection such as pneumonia, sepsis or meningitis. Recently there have been reports of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), a very aggressive form of Staph that's resistant to antibiotics, in gyms, but it's extremely rare.
How do you get it?
It's spread through contact, so it can be picked up through a shared towel or razor, exercise equipment surfaces and grips or skin-to-skin contact.
How do you treat it?
A course of antibiotics should do the trick.

-------------CANDIDA---------------------
What is it?
The most common culprit in fungal infections, this yeast-like fungus can lead to everything from athlete's foot to ringworm to jock itch in men and yeast infections in women.
How do you get it?
Contact. It loves warm, moist areas, so locker rooms, saunas, swimming pools and showers are the perfect environment to pick up some tasty foot fungus.
Symptoms-
Ringworm is usually marked by ring-shaped skin rashes, usually on your toes, sometimes on your palms and between your fingers. Athlete's foot gives you itchy, cracked, flaking and peeling skin between the toes or side of the foot, while jock itch causes a rash on your groin. If it's untreated, it can escalate to blisters and severely cracked skin.
How do you treat it?
Antifungal creams, but if it escalates into an infection, antibiotics will do the trick.
-----------STREPTOCOCCAL BACTERIA--------------------------
What is it?
A type of bacteria that usually causes upper respiratory infections--strep throat. There are 20 different types of strep bacteria.
How do you get it?
It's very contagious and is spread through person-to-person contact, airborne droplets, doorknobs and other surfaces. Sweaty exercise equipment, saunas, locker rooms and drinking bottles can harbor strep.
Symptoms-
Symptoms can range from mild throat infections to pneumonia. It can also cause skin infections such as impetigo, which causes blisters, and cellulitis, which affects deeper layers of skin.
How do you treat it?
Antibiotics, although minor strep infections, such as a throat and inner ear infections, usually get better on their own. Skin infections are treated with antibiotic tablets or creams, and more serious infections like pneumonia and meningitis require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics.</Review>< userid>

The Ladies Room is always filthy.  The manager and employees do nothing except sit on their asses at their computers to sign people up.  Can't get anybody to help you explain a machine.  Rules are not enforced.</Text>

(Translated by Google) My discomfort is the following, it is already 3 times that I go to the Gym to cancel my family plan, and they always have an excuse, that the right person is not there, that I call on the phone, I do everything and nobody helps me cancel my membership, without However, they continue to charge me, at a time like this, for everything we are going through with Covid, it seems unfair to me that companies and businesses take advantage of people, if they continue to extend it like this they will continue to charge me and logically with all this, go to gym is very risky, that's why I want to cancel my membership, but I see that they do nothing to help me, the abuse is regrettable.

(Original)
Mi incomodidad es la siguiente, ya son 3 veces que voy al Gym para cancelar mi plan familiar, y siempre tienen una excusa, que no está la persona indicada, que llame por teléfono, hago todo y nadie me ayuda a cancelar mi membresia, sin embargo me siguen cobrando, en un momento como este, por todo lo que estamos pasando con el Covid, me parece injustos que empresas y negocios se aprovechen de la gente, si lo siguen alargando así me seguirán cobrando y lógicamente con todo esto, ir al gym es muy riesgoso, por eso quiero cancelar mi membresia, pero veo que no hacen nada por ayudarme, es lamentable el abuso.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The service, attention and cleanliness of the gym are excellent, the only thing missing is some vigilance in the pool area, since lately many people enter without bathing before, with inappropriate clothing such as short pants, shoes !! And even people who wash in the Yakusi.

<Review>(Translated by Google) There are not enough weights to work and oh that looking for more than 15 minutes to the case is not enough money to buy a few dozen weights oo There is no good administration since there are many machines broken down the Jacuzzi broken down for more than 5 days and it is not cheap the script to start more than the monthly payments I say that in the case it is not enough for the maintenance the place is good it is nice but not with that exercise is needed more weights are needed more for the hours with more people since if I do not know how to leave earlier but I do not want to say more weight is needed

Another one is to put coaches who really give themselves to work with their clients since they only put them to exercise or tell them what posture to take and ay people who do not know and of course they settle for the bad warm work really to have a coach like that it is not good since one is only spending a badly invested money

(Original)
No ay suficiente pesas para trabajar y ay que estar buscando por más de 15 minutos al caso no es suficiente entrada de dinero para comprar unas dosenas de pesas o o No ay una buena alministracion  ya que ay muchas máquinas descompuestas el Jacuzzi descompuesto por más de 5 días y no es barato la escrision para empesar más de las mensualidades digo que al caso no les alcanza para el mantenimiento el lugar está bien es agradable pero no con eso se ba hacer ejercicio se nesecita más pesas más para las horas con mayor gente ya que si no se trabajar se iva más temprano pero no buelvo a decir se nese tan más pesas

Otra más pongan entrenadores que realmente se entregen  a trabajar con sus clientes ya que solo los ponen hacer ejercicios ni les dicen que postura tomar y ay gente que no sabe y claro que se conforman con la mala cálida de trabajo realmente para tener un entrenador@ así no es bueno ya que uno solo está gastando un dinero mal invertido</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>
