<review>The Vacaville Les Swab is my first choice because it’s closest.  Since 2003 they have maintained my two trucks, car, and granddaughter’s cars. From batteries to tires, and brakes. This is the only business I can claim to have always done the work needed, at a fair price and never have I had to return to get work corrected.  The honesty and integrity of the men and woman has always been to the highest standards.</review>< Pics>

First time here & it was a great experience. My brakes started making horrible sounds out of nowhere & I needed a place quick! They were able to diagnose my car & do my work same day even without an appointment. The staff were friendly, helpful & greeted everyone with a pleasant "hello how are you?" Would highly recommend & will be back for future car needs👍</Text>

I love Les Schawb.  They are world class.  And they warranty their tires and work.  They open the door for you and treat you so good.  Never going to buy tires anywhere else.  Been their customer for the last 22 years.<//text>

You would lie if you said the prices are competitive. However, the service was good and they had the tires I needed on a Saturday afternoon. You can't beat that. The counter guy knew tires and he was patient. When you need to make a purchase you can appreciate a salesman that gets you to buy what you need to buy.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I took my van to Les Schwab after going to a Goodyear shop. (In another state) I had a nail in one of my tires that had approximately 10k miles on them. Goodyear said I should replace all 4 tires so they would be the same, they couldn’t preform the nail extraction because it was too close to the wall- and quoted me a few hundred dollars.  After saying no I think you’re trying to charge me for service I do not need. I took my van to Les Schwab without them knowing what Goodyear said. No problem we can remove your nail for no charge!
This is why we return to Les Schwab. Great service. No up charges. Will return when I actually need tires!<//Text>< pictures>

It was horrible I authorized replacement of a two tires was given a quote when I went to pick up tires they upgraded them to a more expensive tire which I told them I didnt want. Was they said that was all they had. They never called to let me know they didnt have the tires I authorized just took it upon themselves to upsell me. WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS AGAIN WITH THOSE CROOKS . AM THINKING OF NOTIFYING TRAVIS AFB ON HOW THEY TREAT VETS AND POSSIBLY THE ACTIVE DUTY  MILITARY THERE. BE VERY CAUTIOUS!!!!!!</text>

<text>These people are amazing!!! Blew a tire on my 2002 Civic at like 5:15pm literally 12 miles from my home. Somehow made it the 1.3 miles to the shop. Sadly financial things got crazy due to being in the middle of a move. They worked with me on the price a little. And when I finally got the money transferred to my account, which was at 6:08pm, yes that's after they actually closed, two amazing mechanics stayed late and replaced my tire. They didn't get any extra bonus or overtime. They stayed just to help. Absolutely amazing people!! From the front desk woman, the manager and the mechanics. They brought a glimmer of light into this very difficult experience!! So beyond grateful!!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy7cw7ggstLRdo2Mkv_r2EQ8AeTKRVTFoFyKTg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

Great experiences up until I needed my tires rotated and balanced.  Had to go back 3 times to get it done right. First time they didn't balance them. Second time,  they did only the front.  Third time they got the back.</Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I just paid $585 for 2 tires for a 2010 Hyundai Genesis Coupe. I was in a hurry to get to Sacramento, and took my car in for what I thought was going to be a quick fix for my tire that felt like I was driving on a flat. The mechanic came up to me and said the tire was going to explode and that the other one is bald, so he recommended that I replace them. I had an hour before I had to get to my appointment, and the woman at the front showed me two options. The first one was about $850 dollars for these tires that would be ordered online (2 tires guys, not 4), and the second was the $585 option (It's a persuasion tactic that businesses use to get the buyer to take the bait. Oh $585 doesn't seem nearly as bad at $850).  I asked if there were any coupons or anything and she just replied with a stern "No." Mind you, I don't know anything about tires or cars for that matter. And I honestly feel like they took advantage of my ignorance. I am never coming back to Les Schwab and have told all my coworkers about this place.

EDIT: Hi Nate,

No I was not given 3 options. I clearly stated to Rob, that I was given 2 options and he was surprised that I saw the cheaper quote that was in the mechanics hand. ALSO, Rob tried to save the sale and ask me if my Genesis was an all wheel drive. I said, I don't know anything about cars. He said, if it's an all wheel drive, then the 4 tires have to be the same. So therefore, the tires stay on the car. I googled, called him back, and told him it's a rear wheel drive, so take the tires off my car. Every man than I have spoken with automatically knew my car was rear wheel drive, yet this supposed mechanic pretended to not know.

Did you also see in the quota that I returned your overpriced tires??? Probably selective fact sharing. In addition, I read your  30 day policy-which by the way, he said I couldn't return the tires because feeling ripped off is not a good enough reason to return them.  I don't know why you're commenting Nate, when you clearly weren't there. And you're outright lying about the quotes. I guess you too are trying to save the reputation of Les Schwab. People, DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE!!!!!!<//Text>< Pics>

The first for $260.71, the next for $351.71 and the premium option for $595.23.  No option is anywhere near $850.00.  If you are unhappy with your purchase, feel free to come back and you can exchange them for something cheaper under our 30 day money back guarantee.

Husband got 4 new tires here. Card was charged and declined but went through our bank account. After filling a claim, I had to go down there and pay. 2 weeks later we then had to return again, but to the Dixon store. Husband's tires were wobbling over 65mph. Turns out, VV filled all four tires to different amounts & two of the weights were off. What a mess!</review>

<review>Early today around 8:30am I noticed my tire pressure warning light was on, so I went straight to Les Schwab and they put air in all my tires. Later today after lunch and a few errands my warning light was still on, so I went back to Les Schwab for them to check and see if I had a slow leak. After about an hour they called me to the counter and said they found one tire with a nail, but no puncture. They even tried to no avail to reset the tire warning light. The surprise of this visit was all service and check was complementary. Thanks 😊 Les Schwab!!!< /review>< pics>

Customer Service is usually always friendly and fast and attentive that's not a problem normally an issue the quality of work is horrible and incomplete...meaning first i bought two new batteries for my truck and when I went to drive outta town that same day I went to put radiator fluid in my radiator and noticed the batteries were not installed properly and they never tightened either mounts back down, dangerous!! also, I had my tires rotated, balanced, etc. and they failed to put my brand new centercaps back on two of my tires and later that same day the other two centercaps had at some point fell completely off the truck while I was driving and are now lost. Lame!!< /review>

<review>I've been buying tires (as my main alternative to Costco) and batteries from Les Schwab for many years and the Vacaville branch is your typical Les Schwab.  Reasonable speed, service, friendly employees who seem to have a pretty good understanding of their own business equipped with the correct skills to do the job.  The store is clean, organized...it's hard to find serious faults with this company...<//review>< Rating>

When I explained to them I was on the way to a ball game, they did everything they could to get to may car quickly. I only waited for 30 mins as opposed to the estimated 1 hour. I was on my way in no time. Very grateful to this staff for helping me out so quickly< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The drop in wait time is a bit long, thus the 4 stars. Workers are polite and courteous. They do flat repairs for free on most occasions, which is awesome.

The wait time is anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour or so if you walk in. Not terrible, but long enough. They have refreshments and plenty of sitting areas while you wait.<//Text><user_id>115693298549985980615<//user_id><pics>None< /pics>< Rate>

<review>A little bit late on this review but I experienced great above average care from this establishment! I went in thinking I needed a new set of tires and an alignment job. Instead of taking me for my money they came out inspected my vehicle for FREE, brought it in the back, rotated the tires, checked my breaks, did an hour plus worth of work for absolutely no charge. Also found I didn’t need tires and that the shaking I was feeling was from access wear on one side of my tires and not the other! Now my car rides smooth again and doesn’t pull to one side! Definitely recommend and they will have my business as soon as I’m ready for a new set of tires. Oh and I didn’t mention they did it all with a smile and gave the impression they really cared, thanks!< /review>< pictures>

<Text>🙂 Very nice and knowledgeable staff members, who are courteous and professional, knowledgeable about vehicles. They have very good deals on tires and rims. Also they do lift kits for trucks, jeeps. I also like how they do very quality alignments, and installing brakes, rotors, shocks, struts. They also have a service to replace your tire, if you should break down because of flat tire or blow out. 🙂 I think maybe road service is for big rigs and recreational vehicles. They also sell ATV tires and rims.😃 The store in Vacaville is very clean and cluttered free. There is free coffee and popcorn able while you wait for vehicle. Also can watch something on the Television. Very happy to have Les Schwab in Vacaville community. 🤠 Keep up the very good work.        🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇🍇</Text>< response>

Stood in the waiting area at the counter of a sales rep standing on the opposite side of the counter completely ignoring me, but as soon as another customer walked in after my wait time.

Les understands what service is.  They will take care of what you need as soon as possible.  I am a loyal fan and will not go anywhere else for tires as Les is just there when you need help. If your tire can be salvaged they will repair your flat for free.< /text>

I've been going to Les Schwab for over 10 years. I've loved the customer service and maintenance they continue to give on the various tires I've purchased.

But stick with tires only because I've had a terrible experience with getting new brakes here. In short I've been back 4 times, eventually got another set of brakes under warranty and still have issues. The brakes rattle when going over any bump in the road and after 2 sets of breaks and 4 multi hour trips they still rattle and sound like they are going to fall off...< /Review>

I commute from Sacramento to Vacaville for work. On my way to get lunch I got a flat.  Hot and tired after walking to this location, I expected the big business mentality of waiting forever with unsympathetic employees. It was very busy when I walked in. Brandon's personality instantly perked me up and he immediately called in Jose, who drove me to my car and got my tire operable enough to drive back to Les Schwab. Under 20 minutes my tire was patched and I was able to make it back to work on time. Thank you! It's small things like this that make  those life annoyances so much more bearable! When I need a full set I'll be happy to drive from Sacramento to this location to get them!< /text>

<Time>1446578754626<//Time><rate>1</rate><Review>I have been going to Les Schwab in Vacaville Ca for about 20 years and have always received great service. Recently I took my car in to have them check out the front end alignment, they did and had to order a part which was ok and did the job. Well today I went to Les Schwab for rotation and balance and have them check my alignment. Must wait 1 1/2 hours for rotation and balance and need an appointment for alignment not good. I am going to Tahoe NV this week and need this done. I also thought that they would check to see if you needed an  alignment when they rotate and balance your tires, not so. I went for years without knowing I needed an alignment my Dealer discovered I needed this done and that is when I found that Les Schwab does not check this each time you take your car in so now my good tires are worn on the inside. So much for good customer service.</Review>< pictures>

I'm tired of this place ripping people off. I can get a tire from the dealership for less then they were charging. I checked. There excuse, "well we have to order it." Guess what..... So did the dealership. They try to rip off my friends mom saying that a brake job costs $500...... and I asked why. "According to the manual you need to replace the calipers with a pad change." ........ according to the manual I should take it to a dealership, not a outside source. I remember when you use to come out to the car when I pulled up..... now I can't even find someone at a front desk..... Vacaville, Fairfield, and Dixon....  ill take my business else where..... and word of mouth does spread.</review>

<UserId.>111491441250922077103< /UserId.><name>Michael Fien< /name><resp>None< /resp><Review>I have stood by Les Schwab for years for their great customer service and fair pricing, but my last visit changed that. I've bought new rims from another tire place and wanted the new Toyo tires A/T from Les Schwab, brought them in and mounted new tires. Long story short i had to wait to put the new set of tires on until I installed my lift, once I've installed my new set I dicovers one of my NEW rims was damaged where the lug seats. I couldnt prove it was them do to the fact i waited a week before i installed my lift. I came back to change out my Tire sensors (forgot about those) from my stock rims. After i went home to unload my stock tires i noticed that one of my stock rims was damaged on the face of the rim. I went back to Les schwab and demanded a new rim. This is not acceptable! The store manager James would did not believe it was his guys that did the damage and basicly called me a liar. He did though give me my refund for the mount and balance ($62.00) plus a store credit($85.00) for future alignment. A rim cost $130 for my jeep, guess he didnt want to admit it. I will never be coming back to this location due to the fact I feel the people are unexperienced and careless.</Review><Date>1412061137305<//Date><gmap_id>0x80853d51c3b352bd:0x5c8d0c591e13bf43< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

So I called for an appointment and the guy on the phone gave me timings for 11 and when I went there next day they were asking everyone around who took appointment. It seems this place runs on very bad management I had to wait for 20 min and no one was even asking if I have an appointment or not... I would suggest go somewhere else...</review>

High Quality cuts! Ali the barber has a way to cut any hairstyle. Licensed and street cut combined. For those who don’t know what that means the man knows how to cut good. Legit one the best barbers in SoCal.</Text>

Great place to cut your hair, all the barbers know what they are doing hands down you won't go wrong. The only bad thing here is they are all ways booked. For someone like myself who is all ways on the go and different work hours it makes it hard to go in for a cut. Would recommend if your willing to wait a couple of hours.</review>
<Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1506282913898, 'text': 'Hi, thanks for your review! Also, if you have different schedules, it’s better to call in the morning to the shop and ask for any barber that can get you at whatever available times you can go, you won’t wait hrs any more. Also JT, does online booking, and his schedule is online, so you can book up to a week in advance. Go to Filthybarbers.com/barbers and get anyone’s number direct and JTs booking Link. 👍🏻👍🏻'}< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2cebc1b8cadd7:0x214020a99d2db821</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Place sucks with customer service. Guys are constantly talking and there is no walk ins welcome. You have to book an appointment. Last time I went in I told the guy not to cut my hair from the top but what does he do. He cuts it then asks would you like shorter. Are you serious? C'mon now.<//text>

< Review>
Right before our prom to, Yes it looks good sure it's nice and everything but seriously had the worst experience ever. First of all  everyone is playing on the ps4 second of all the guy that cut my hair I believe his name is Joshua  didn't seem to care.  This person messed up on my lineup and on my side he made some kind of nasty curve and said   ''Thats how we do it here"  and he only messed up on one side so are you going to tell me that you mess up on one side and on the other you don't c'mon bro. I seriously shouldn't have paid for a $15 haircut not worth it. So if you people are looking to go there and cut your hair Don't Go it's too expensive and worst customer service.< /Review>

<Text>Ordered the Black Bean Patty at Which Which and was not disappointed! There are so many toppings too! What a great place for a quick bite to eat. I'm so happy I no longer have to go to Subway and eat veggies on bread. This place has it right!<//Text>< user_name>

<Text>It was my first time to go there. It is an amazing way to order your sandwich. There are many choices given on the brown sandwich bag and you pick up on bag ,mark down what you like and give it to the person. I ordered lettuce wrap with sauce and cheese, some filling of vegies and it was excellent. It was messy to eat but was very tasty. I will go there again</Text>< pictures>

Sandwiches of ok quality, what you can expect from a sandwich chain. The kids "awesome grilled cheese" tastes like a stick of pure butter.

They forgot to put some selections on both my and my sister's sandwich.

I liked that the kid's meal gives healthy options and gives the parent the choice of whether the kid gets a treat because you need a token to get M&Ms.<//Text>

Great sandwiches.  My first time visiting the brand of sub shops and was a bit surprised on how to order.  Once it was figured out, it was easy and went back many times for class that week.  Friendly kids behind the counter too.<//Review>

Some locations use way too much lettuce for the lettuce wrap. This one had the perfect amount. The sandwiches tasted great.<//Review>

I received absolutely the best care from Dr. Jennifer Hom and her assistant Alicia. I cracked my tooth and they got me in that day despite being extremely busy. I was very worried about my appointment. They were patient with me and took time to make sure I was comfortable. Dr Hom explained all the steps of the procedure and answered my questions. The actual procedure was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I highly recommend this practice. They are a great team! And Virginia at the front desk was very helpful in arranging my referral appointment.< /Text>

I was referred to Dr. Shih's practice by my former dentist of 42 years upon his retirement. To be honest, I was skeptical. But from the first contact with Marisa on the phone I was put at ease and looked forward to my visit. Everyone knew that I preferred Becky to Rebecca and that did it. I was sold. This was gonna be my next dental home. These are very skillful, warm, welcoming women who makes one feel at ease while thoroughly doing their allotted tasks. I look forward to a long relationship with Sandy, Margot, Connie, Virginia and Marisa.<//Text>

<review>I went to this office for the first time a couple of days ago because I was referred by my previous dentist, who was retiring. The staff was extremely gracious, friendly, and helpful (they even sanitized my cell phone for me!). I felt very comfortable that they took all necessary precautions to keep patients safe in this uncertain time in the pandemic. Dr. Shih was very thorough and knowledgeable. I'm looking forward to going there again next month to take care of some cosmetic fixes.</review><GmapID>0x808f7db879893841:0xd39209e8120b5b67<//GmapID><username>OV 0829</username>< resp>

<text>My dentist Dr. Hom is the best doctor I've had in  long time. Dr. Hom was gentle and very thorough. I felt like she really cared about my teeth.
Lisa the Dental Hygienist cleaned my teeth so well I thought I had a new set.
Everyone in the the office were cheerful
and professional. Made me feel like part
of the family.
I highly recommend Ocean Avenue Dental to anyone looking for GREAT people to take GREAT care of their dental work.
High marks to everyone at Ocean Avenue Dental. THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!

Honestly, out of all the dental offices I have been in this one is by far the best. The staff is knowledgeable, they are friendly and funny, they have perfect technique and bedside manner, and nurture every patient to ensure you have everything you need. Ultimately, they care about you and genuinely want to see you again. Can’t thank the staff enough for all they do and how welcome they make me feel. Much love!<//text>

This was my first dental appointment in Covid 2020. I am happy to say that I felt safe and well cared for. I waited outside until the front counter was clear. The hygienist was masked, wore a face shield and was fully gowned and gloved. Thank you Ocean Avenue Dentistry.</Text>

I got bioclear done on my 4 top front teeth by Dr. Shih in August 2020. She did an incredible job, no one can tell they aren’t my natural teeth! She is also a lovely person, as is everyone who works in the office. I felt so calm and safe with everyone who worked in my mouth as well as the front desk. Seriously haven’t met a kinder group of people at a dentist office before! Highly highly recommend if you are looking to get bioclear, and for just your general dentistry!</Review>

<review>I just moved to the area and had my first visit with Dr Shih. I have pretty high anxiety going to the dentist, but the clinic staff were very pleasant and accommodating. Dr. Shih is very thorough, and made sure I understood my options and plan upon leaving the office. Connie, the hygienist was an absolute pleasure!! Margot the assistant was also very nice. They were all very accommodating, I highly recommend if you are looking to establish care with an excellent team.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808f7db879893841:0xd39209e8120b5b67<//gmapID></record>

Sandy is the best dentist I met. This is my most impressive dental clean experience. The stain on my teeth had been bothered me for years. I had several dental clean but could not get the stains away. Sandy was very professional and carefully take the stains away. I’m transferring my kids to this dental office too.<//Text>

Cannot say enough great things about Sandy (Dr. Shih) and Connie. I appreciate how well they remember the small details of our conversations from past visits. It is clear they really care about my teeth and my comfort during procedures. They always take the time make sure I am comfortable and offer solutions if one thing is not working well.< /text>

Listen, I understand going to the dentist is scary. I have family members that need to be sedated in order to go. In my opinion; no teeth, gross teeth, bad breath or missing teeth are far worse. However, this place is amazing and I have only one name....... Connie Connie Connie and did I mention Connie?

She is amazing!!! Gentle, sweet, caring and she remembers everything from your previous conversation. She is like a family member, but one that makes sure your smile is pretty.

Anyways, you should call ASAP! Connie is very popular.

And you are welcome.< /Review>

I'm a medical student at Stanford, so this is quite a trek for me, but I feel safe in Dr. Shih's expert hands. She is the most thorough dentist I have ever had (her intake exam was extensive). I'm a very nervous and particular patient and she does an amazing job working with me. She has an excellent communication style and is honest. Noelle performed a cleaning for me and she also did an amazing job. Marisa at the front desk is also very welcoming and sweet. This practice is a gem and I feel very lucky to be a patient here.<//review>< Pics>

Sandy Shih is amazing. She fixed my chipped tooth and got me some fillings that really helped with some chronic gum issues. Great bedside manner. I would absolutely recommend her to a friend! Reasonable pricing options for all kinds of customers too<//review>

I have been going to Dr. Muncheryan and Dr.Bianchi for more than 10 years and I have always been very satisfied with the services they provided. They also are assisted by a very professional and friendly staff. I highly recommend this group for excellent dental care.</review>

Always a pleasure to visit this office and see familiar faces. They are definitely extra careful with all the PPE requirements. There's air purifiers everywhere and you have to rinse before to see the dentist or hygienist. It's great! I love a clean office.< /Review>

Sandy actually makes it a pleasure to be in the dental chair.  I don't believe you could find a better more qualified dentist anywhere.  Sandy has a fabulous staff  and keeps the facility immaculate.
Anyone who connects with Sandy as their dentist is going to get the absolute best care for their precious teeth and gums.  Sandy I am so pleased, happy and such a lucky person to have you as my dentist.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>118415410328234320432</UserId.>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Bianchi replaced a lost/broken filling quickly, skillfully, and with concern for my comfort in a manner that left me fully confident in his abilities. I had not been treated by him before. Like most people I don’t look forward to dental visits, but this experience was so throughly and unexpectedly enjoyable I almost look forward to some future dental needs.<//Text>< pictures>

Had my 6 month cleaning and check up at Ocean Avenue Dentistry by Noelle Bianchi, R.D.H. and Dr. Kenneth Bianchi.  Noelle is gentle, efficient, and thorough. On top of that she is a wonderful person.
And Dr. Kenneth A Bianchi D.D.S., only thing I can say, he is the  Best Dentist!  I've been going to them for over 30 years.</review>

<review>I like that she is patient when she cleans my teeth. She tells me what is next in the procedure. Yesterday went well. Dr. Kenneth examined my teeth because the other two were not there. When he checked for soreness in my upper jaw his way of tapping was surprisingly rough as was his turning of my tongue to check in there. There is a thing called bedside manner relative to doctors and their patients. I believe that applies here as well. In the future if a procedure is needed I would ask that he not be the one to do it< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808f7db879893841:0xd39209e8120b5b67< /gmap_id></record>

She is wonderful,kind considerate and puts you at ease right away,I am a big chicken when it comes to procedure,but not with her.She explains everything before starting,which gives you  a great feeling of total confidence,could not have chosen a better dentist.gigi Marki rn< /Text>

<Review>Dr. Sandy T. Shih did great for me this morning.
She has a light touch and we can call her painless.

The clinic is clean and comfortable.  Besides Dr. Sandy T. Shih 's professional service, she is very friendly and attentive to patient.  I can feel that Dr. Shih is care of all patients.  Moreover, Dr. Shih can speak Chinese and meets my needs.<//Review>

< Review>
My Dentist Dr. Muncheryan had an office up the street, then partnered with Dr. Shih, DDS (very nice). I had always loved his staff from the first office, now I have more awesome Dentist in one office.  Gentle touch, great conversations.  I am so very happy I was directed to this office.

6/2/2019 updt
I am still a patient with this office Dr. Shih, DDS has become my dentist which is great because I feel comfortable around her as I was with Dr. Muncheryan. AND there is a new young lady in the Reception Area, she like Virgina makes you feel very comfortable. I would gladly say this is a 10 star office.</Review>

<user>105852869865813340184< /user><Text>I LOVE SANDY SHIH!!!! I am writing this as a sad former patient, because I moved to San Jose and about to have my second child so I can't easily make it up to SF anymore :(  But I swear if I didn't have kids to contend with, I would make the drive up just to see Dr. Shih.

She is absolutely incredible!!!  She is the sweetest person I have ever met.  I have never had a better dentist.  She is so bright and cheery and truly truly cares about her patients.  I called to tell her that I moved just so she knew why I wasn't coming back for a cleaning and on the phone, she asked about my pregnancy and also remembered not only the first name of my daughter but her MIDDLE name too!!! I mean come on, how nice is that?!  I would bring my daughter in with me and she did so much to keep her entertained while I got my teeth cleaned, she had all sorts of toys that she gave her and she even blew up a rubber glove to let her play with like a balloon!! hahaha :)  Just one of the thousand of reasons I love Dr. Shih :)

She is such a happy person and is just so so kind, but she is also very much a professional.  I always trusted her judgement and she never made me feel embarrassed for being too lazy to floss hahaha :)  I knew I could ask her about anything related to my dental health and she would know the answer.  She made adjustments to my mouth guard so many times to get it just right so I could be comfortable wearing it at night (I'm a tooth grinder!).

She is an incredible person and an incredible dentist.  Do yourself a favor and go see her, I bet you that you will not regret it!!!!< /Text>< Response>

< Review>
I recently went to Ocean Avenue Dentistry for Invisalign before my wedding and I couldn't be happier with how my teeth look!  Dr. Sandy Shih was extremely thorough with her directions on how to maximize the strength of the Invisalign during the treatment.  If anyone has any doubt about Invisalign, take it from me, the procedure is worth the time and money.  Dr. Shih and her staff were very helpful with scheduling my appointments and accommodating the times that worked best for me.  I would recommend Dr. Shih to any of my friends that are looking for a professional and reasonably priced dentist in San Francisco.</Review>

<review>This Bakery/Cafe was a lifesaver for me, my first time there.  Christina was extraordinary helpful and patient with a special style of cake I needed within 2 days for my mothers surprise birthday reunion.  She took her time on line looking up different styles of casino theme cakes until we found the perfect one.  The cake was beautiful and absolutely delicious! They perfectly executed the design I wanted and it turn out to be the perfect birthday cake!  we received many compliments all night from our guests about how much they enjoyed the cake! The icing is not the overly sweet kind you may find at some places.  She even gave me a free pastry of the kind I order for the cake so my mom can taste it and it was delicious! They have excellent customer service from beginning to end! This will be my go to place from now on!!!  Thanks to Christina and her staff I was able to give my mother a wonderful surprise birthday cake with her favorite theme CASINO!!!< /review>< Pics>

This is my first time here in this coffee shop and I can say it's worth trying. The service is very fast and this is a comfy place to study with outlets if you need to use a laptop. It's usually not crowded and there is a good menu if you wanna stay longer and eat here too. The workers are kind and attentive as well. I would come here again and recommend it to friends.<//Text>

Very friendly staff and delicious choices. They also make killer cakes upon your request. You guys are life savers for birthday cakes. It came out amazing!
Keep it up!< /Review>< pics>

Absolutely amazing cakes!!! I will say the shortcake were better of the two cakes that we tried out from the bakery I really did enjoy trying it out for the first time to see what their cakes were like.

The cakes are not too spongy or soggy. I will say I was expecting more out of the cheesecake and was hoping to have more of a homemade cheesecake taste to it. I do not think this was the best cheesecake I come the New York and east coast area and we take the taste of cheesecake very serious and I will say I would not buy the cheesecake again. But the shortcake for sure!!!!<//text>

This place if full of great treats. I come here so often and I can't get enough. They could use some work on whoever makes the cupcakes and the cookies take a like backing powder but other than that I love it.</review>

<review>Love this place. Service is always friendly. Everything I have tried is delicious from the cakes to the pastries. The cheese rolls are definitely my favorite. I always make sure to pick up a half dozen for me and my boys as well as try something new. I love the lattes. My favorite is the white chocolate latte. It is a must try. Small business in a small outdated shopping center is a hidden Gem of deliciousness.</review>< pictures>

< Review>
They have really good tres Leches cakes here. They are not overly sweet and just very well balanced cakes. The owners are also super nice and the pastries here are also on point. Would definitely recommend. Inside they also have a  nice and quaint seating are that is perfect for ordering a coffee and having any pastry they serve.
They also do advanced cake orders. We ordered three cakes for a graduation and they did a great job making them look delicious and like all thier pastries, tasted delicious!</Review>

<text>The coffee is freshly brewed and rich in flavor. Tasted their coffee bun, brioche bread and a slice of vanilla cake. All three were light, tasty, and not heavily laden with sugar. Friendly and efficient serve!< /text>< pics>

What a fantastic group of health care workers.  Everyone from NA's, nurses, doctors, administration,  radiology,  are simply awesome. I had broken ribs in a rafting accident and as soon as I walked into the emergency room they were on it. So impressed with this hospital and the staff that I cannot say enough good things about. Thank you to all the staff members that helped through a painful situation. ~Stacia</Review>

I recently went into the hospital with my first experience of pneumonia and stayed a total of 3 days. The care and respect from the doctors and nurses was incredible. They not only show compassion but they are also sincere. I’m grateful for everyone that helped me recover. 🤍<//Review>

<text>PLEASE READ
1. Nearly impossible to navigate, especially during COVID. No one will volunteer directions, so ask ask ask. First visit I was told to go to hospital, ended up walking around women’s clinic building trying to find my appointment. Also not signed. Was late to apt. Leave early, allow time to find.

2. 2nd visit, given an address that maps to a building w no outside access. I parked and walked up to the door that clearly says open and the hours. Guess what? Not open. All doors and now closed except the front door, due to COVID. But no signs or any reason you’d think to go around to the one door that’s open at the opposite side of the block.

3. Not notified till 3:30p the day prior of an $1800 copay. When I was clearly shocked at this, still no one mentions there may be financial assistance, but of course they mention the payment plan at least twice. The financial department says there is no financial help for a scheduled procedure. Please be advised, there IS financial assistance for EMERGENCYS. If I had went to the er rather than waited weeks to see a specialist, they would have given me financial assistance outside of state medi-cal. Three calls later, at 6p the night before, still unsure if I should drink two bottles of laxitives for prep, apparently I do qualify for medi-cal and there will be 0 cost. Again, ask, ask, ask. This will not be volunteered.

4. I had to ask what drugs will be used. So sad we cannot trust hospitals, doctors or nurses to educate us or even tell the truth so we can educate ourselves. Still not a soul has mentioned side effects or risks, what fentynol is or explained what conscious sedation is. Why, when it’s a tolerable procedure, do we have to go strait to fentynol when almost anything would work. Why are my options not told to me? Twice I asked about alternatives  to fentynol I was given one, yes one Xanax. When I asked about more or something else was turn down flat. Ibuprofen? Tylenol? Anything? Really? Obviously this did nothing for my anxiety or for afterpain and cramping that is expected. Is this backlash for questioning? This is a hospital, Why fentynol or nothing? Really? Again ask, ask, ask.

No one ever mentioned that we have the option to not use drugs at all and most can tolerate it fine w out. Most people, given the option, prefer it. Or that waiting and seeing is fine and if uncomfortable something can, at that point be put in an iv and administered immediately if uncomfortable. I was originally told I’d be sedated. A half truth. Versed is used to consciously sedate. This will mean that you are awake, but you won’t remember it. But sometimes your body does remember and it causes nightmares indefinitely. It can also cause significant memory loss up to 15% permanently, which I think is significant enough to mention

Educate yourself and do not be pushed into anything. Ask questions and complain if your questions are met w resistance. You likely have options you are not aware of< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKs5DSXc4S_BZz7LUGKVlJRqHvr9CzUpYkVpZX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

I am on the phone with my parents, in their 80's.  Tahoe Forest Hospital some how got my folks in for their vaccinations.  My mom is raving about how professional and nice every one whom helped them was the day of their first and second vaccinations.  THANK YOU!

< review>
Going to the ER is stressful at any time, but going now during the pandemic even more so. I was impressed from the moment I stepped inside--a nurse brought me into a private room almost immediately. Every staff member I dealt with did their best to put me at ease and make sure I was comfortable. I dislike going to the doctor, getting tests done, but my positive experience here made me less reluctant to seek medical care.<//review>

< Review>
I'm am a 27 year old Tahoe native, born and raised. During the current Covid 19 pandemic we find ourselves in, you would think that they would be on top of their game regarding covid 19 symptoms, inaccurate test results, and up to date information surrounding the virus such as is related to Covid 19 long haulers. I caught covid 19 on July 15th (basing this claim on symptomotology) and tested negative despite having all the symptoms. Before July 15th I was a straight A college student on my last year of community college in addittion to being very active, as I mountianbiked 90 miles per week!!!! I was in bed for 2 months straight and its been almost 6 months since I came down with this illness. I have been to the E.R at least if not over 15 times within these 6 months and they tell me there is nothing wrong with me every single time. At this point I have been in there so many times that Doctors and nurses belittle me and talk down on me in a condescending manner, basically telling me its all in my head despite current up-to-date information on Covid long haulers and their struggle and symptoms. They seem to be apathetic to the current pandemic as far as keeping themselves informed on treatment and complications surrounding the virus. I only go because its the nearest hospital, but in all honesty, it seems like a denagerous organization to trust your health with. I've heard many and things about this hospital, but didn't believe it until my health was so severe and I had to run to them for help. They seem like they could care less about their patients health and finances, all they care about is the money.<//Review>

< Review>
The doctors and staff here are super awesome. I came in with a skiing injury (of course). I hit my head pretty hard so I don’t actually remember spending any time in this hospital before I got transferred to reno but the stitches on my face were done at tahoe forest and when I got them taken out they had been done so well the nurse asked me if a plastic surgeon had done them!! Nope, not a plastic surgeon just a very skilled and practiced emergency room doctor while I was unconscious.<//Review>

I want to thank everyone who helped me with my issue and made me feel safe and comfortable.  Special thanks to the ever wonder nurse Joe.  You couldn’t ask for a more attentive and competent nurse.  Also thank you to Dr. Young.  She calmed my concerns and answered all my questions.  I love our town and I love Tahoe Forest Hospital.< /review>< Response>

<review>I have to give a big thank you to the imaging department at Tahoe Forest Hospital. While on vacation I was injured and needed outpatient imaging. TFH was the only facility in the area with the required imaging modality. Because it was a weekend and I was out of town, the process of obtaining prior authorization from my insurance and ultimately scheduling the imaging study was somewhat difficult. The staff of the imaging department, specifically Sami, Cassie  and Jonas were outstanding. They were helpful, caring and provided excellent patient care. I am a physician myself and I know that the service they provided was above and beyond. From what I experienced though my encounter as a patient, I highly recommend Tahoe Forest Hospital.</review><Date>1577733563223<//Date>< Gmap_id>

I was admitted on Xmas day for pneumonia and I wanted to share how impressed I was with the staff in the ER and the ICU!   I work in healthcare and tend to be more critical, and the service I received was nothing short of excellence.   The ICU staff were kind and their passion for caring for people showed through out my stay.   Thank you THF!< /Review>

<text>Who gets excited about going to the Hospital Lab to have blood drawn? But the staff from the minute you walk in to reception to the techs drawing blood, were all very friendly and warm. I found their attitude helped reduce my stress about getting tests done. The techs also were competent and reassured me that results would be done quickly.<//text>< pics>

I told them, and explained it would take a little bit to pay due to the amazingly slow pace that probate court goes at, since the estate was the debtor.

<text>On a recent visit to the E.R. I presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and being a heart patient, I was always told by my primary care physician to get evaluated no matter what. From the moment I walked in I was attended to right away by I believe Alexa, the registration clerk who immediately called the nurse who came out with a wheelchair. I was taken to a room right away and had several people take care of me. The nurses were awesome and so caring and attentive! Macky, Jess, Whitney (I believe that was her name) they began the work up right away with an EKG, started an IV, drew labs. Doctor Laine, was the ER physicsian on duty. They were able to have my records from Renown sent over. I informed them of my heart conditions including an ascending aortic aneurysm which caused concern being my blood pressure was elevated. He immediately ordered a CT scan with contrast which I mentioned I was allergic to and ordered meds to counteract it. Wendy, the CT tech was awesome as well and very reassuring and explained the whole procedure. They kept me warm with warm blankets as I was cold. I was given nitroglycerin tablets as the ones I had taken earlier the E.R. doc explained only have a 2 or 3 month shelf life and in addition to aspirin I was given morphine for chest pain. I was then seen by Doctor Sammels the hospitalist who told me so far, so good but wanted to keep me overnight and redo my labs in the morning. I finally got to a room in med/drug around 1 a.m. and was immediately greeted by the RN house supervisor but don't recall his name but he was awesome! Valerie, my night nurse introduced herself and did my assement and brought me my pain meds. She was awesome as well as my day nurse Mike and the RN house supervisor Fernando, who watched the football game with me. I was attended to by Doctor Katy Schousen, the hospitalist. She was amazing as could be and reassured me my heart was good but a little weak still and my ascending aortic aneurysm was stable. I mentioned to the ER staff that I had a recent syncopal episode and that I had hit my head and chest hard when I fell to the ground. She attributed it to chest wall pain or chostocondritis(chest wall/cartilage inflammation). This by far was a great stay even though I don't like hospital stays but better to be safe than sorry. All the while, Valerie and Mike along with the Jayson, the day shift nursing assistant, kept checking on me and brought me a sandwich to eat rather Valerie did along with some applesauce. As well as the ER staff brought me juice. They all kept me comfortable and reassured. This place rocks. You are all amazing and if there were more than five stars, I'd give them. Keep up the great work!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1573681302789, 'text': "Thank you so much, Patrick, for taking the time to share the details of your experience with us and for acknowledging each of your care team member.

Having been in the hospital for child birth, parental conditions and another surgery, I have to give Tahoe Forest a definite five star rating.  From the kindness of the nurses to the absolutely delicious hospital food to the cleanliness of the entire facility I was absolutely astounded.  If I should ever need orthopedic surgery again, Tahoe Forest is where I will go!< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I am someone who only writes a review when something is exceptional. One week ago I was in need of emergency gallbladder removal surgery. I was in excruciating pain. I made my way first to Incline Village Community Hospital in Incline Village, NV where I call home. Once my pain was managed and it was determined that surgery was needed as soon as possible that day, they transported me to Tahoe Forest Hospital in Truckee, CA, part of the same health system. It truly was an exceptional experience from the beginning. Not having any relatives in the area, the need for emergency surgery could be a scary experience for some. This was not the case here. I'm so blessed to have my friend-family in the area, as well as my extended-Tahoe-community-family. Those in this health system are definitely part of that. Each individual took such sweet, skilled care of me as if I were their own family member. Everyone from triage to my paramedics, nurses and doctors (Dr. Laning Andrews, Dr. Ricki Alpert, Dr. David Kitts, and Dr. Ellen Cooper) were all amazing. I wish I could name everyone. I certainly remember them all. This is my sincere thanks to all of you! I feel amazing, and as if I have a new lease on life. I feel so connected to this area, and you are all such a big reason for that. Please keep doing what you do so well. And for anyone needing health care in the area, these are the best places to go.</review>< pictures>

<Review>We are 35 year locals in Tahoe City. My wife needed 3 tests done as prescribed by her physician. We went to Tahoe Forest Hospital Lab ...wanting to use our local provider. We were shocked when the bill came in at $470. We called Lab Corp in Reno. Their price would have been $261. Then we called Cash Clinical in Reno. Their price would have been $116.

We called the lab and spoke to the man who said he runs the lab (Vern). I told him the above info. He laughed.

Well, we will never use Tahoe Forest Lab again!!  We gave them 1 star because the form would not allow 0 stars.<//Review><gmapID>0x809bdfc8fb61e70f:0x328fdc153cd3728a</gmapID><user_name>Patti Kimmey</user_name><Resp>None<//Resp><user>105447911030592200855< /user></record>

He was seen by Dr. Mozen. He was the rudest ER doctor I have ever meet. He rolled his eyes 8 times while talking,  making us feel inferior because our concern for the injury was unfounded. I’m sorry, Dr. Mozen, if we are concerned and felt the need to get immediate attention. We have never had an injury like that and we were very genuinely worried. You could have given us a more caring and compassionate attitude.

My wife and I were on a family vacation in the Tahoe Donner area when suddenly she became ill. This was on Saint Patrick's Day, a Sunday.
I am a physician and suspected she might have appendicitis and was concerned about bringing her to TFH because I thought a small hospital in the mountains might not have the appropriate physicians, lab, Xray,etc.
Boy were we surprised!
Despite being extremely busy due to many orthopedic and other emergencies filling the ER, my wife was seen and evaluated within a few hours. Dr. Claire Johnson was very kind and ordered the necessary labs and a CT scan which confirmed appendicitis.
Dr. Crystine Lee was the surgeon on call who came and offered antibiotic therapy or appendectomy. Since we had driven from Florida, my wife opted for appendectomy which was performed that night. I couldn't believe we got a Stanford and UCSF trained surgeon who did a fellowship in laparoscopic surgery to do the surgery on a Sunday night, a holiday at that. With Dr. Lee's exceptional training, we felt it best to have her do the surgery rather than taking the chance of the antibiotics not working or having a flare up while we were driving back to Florida.
The anesthesiologist, Dr. Bany, did a thorough pre-op evaluation and we felt very comfortable with her doing the anesthesia.
Not knowing much about the hospital, I decided to spend the night in my wife's room just to keep an eye on things.
Turns out that was unnecessary because her night nurse, Rob, was fantastic. He was so attentive and made us feel completely safe!
From my 37 years of experience as a physician, I know that nurses are the front line of patient care in a hospital setting. A good nurse can save a patient from disaster.
My wife went home the next day and the day nurse, Brad, also seemed highly talented and made us feel at ease.
From start to finish, Tahoe Forest Hospital provided exceptional care to my wife.
Appendicitis is still a life threatening condition, especially if there is a delay in diagnosis or treatment.
We will be forever grateful to Tahoe Forest Hospital and it's excellent staff.
Brian McNulty, M.D.<//text>

After a sledding mishap I had to call 911 for my son.  They brought him to Tahoe Forest Hospital-  They were awesome!  The doctor and nursing staff were so nice.  They even gave me a disc with the hospital report and xrays to give to my local dr.  They had us out after a few hours.  Everyone was so great to a very freaked out mom.<//Review>

<Review>Great care in Truckee. But expensive. I now use less expensive lab and X-ray services in Reno and Carson to avoid massive out-of-pocket costs due to gaps in what TFH charges and what my insurance will pay. PT services in Incline a bit of a circus (front desk issues).< /Review><Rate>3<//Rate><date>1472175518170< /date></record></dataset><record>

<review>Make sure you keep your records and payments receipts if you go here. After paying my bill for an ER visit, I held onto my payment confirmation for over a year before shredding it.

2 years after my ER visit, with no contact with Tahoe Forest Hospital since my final payment, I get a call from a collection agency for the full amount of the initial bill. I requested an itemized account statement since I no longer have my verification of payment. Not only did they never send me the requested statements, the collection agency charged me $150 in interest while I waited. In the end I had to pay the bill all over again plus fees and interest to minimize the damage they did to my credit.

I don't know if this was done out of incompetence or with malicious intent, but the moral of the story is hold onto proof of payment for at least 5 years to them double dipping into your wallet.< /review><username>Shawn Williams< /username><userid>105061789671637582011</userid><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

Slowest bank I've been to(regularly takes 30 minutes to get in and out) but more importantly, their security is INSISTENT that you stand on the red mark on the floor, the minimum social distance.  When I explained that I preferred to stand two marks away from the person in front of me to create more distance, they explained that they wanted to pack as many people as possible inside the bank.  Not cool.</review>

<Text>Time and time again I’ve had bad experiences banking here.  My company has an account and the Mission branch is the closest to our office.  Once I made an appointment online to speak with an account manager.  I showed up early and ended up waiting 20 minutes after our appointment only to be told that the account manager had to cancel our appointment for another client.

On a separate occasion submitted several bills I suspected may be counterfeit.  I was told the bills would be analyzed by the local FBI and someone would be in contact.  I never heard from anyone.  Finally, months later, after following up again and again, I was granted a meeting with a bank representative.  I was invited into his office, he went to retrieve another bank representative who had more information on my case.  When they returned to the office, neither sat down and I was told the FBI had sent the bills to Washington, I would not be reimbursed, and asked to leave.  Both representatives were cold and intimidating.

On Saturday, February 15th, 2020, I had to swing by to make a transaction.  As soon as I walked in the door a teller explained they were closed even though the hours of operations were on the door and website communicated they should be open.  It would have taken a few minutes to update the website.

If you can bank somewhere else.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This is the worst bank branch in San Francisco, if not the US. The lines have been long for 30 years, the service is horrible, no staff takes responsibility for anything ... it's like DMV 20 years but 10x worse. Now DMV learned at some point they could make their experience better, and it made life better for their staff and everyone who has to deal with DMV. No such luck with this BofA. You have to ask, how does a bank branch upset so many people that it gets worse reviews that most restaurants or services. This place must truly be horrible. Believe me, it is. Avoid this branch if you possibly can. I don't have an account with BofA and never will. I'm here again on a Saturday to deposit funds to a friend's account, because their bigger branch at Market/VanNess is closed.< /Review>

Like everyone else here, I am so frustrated with this BOA branch. A big part of the problem, in my opinion, is that so many of the customers are doing banking related actions that could so easily be done at the ATM. This bank needs to do more outreach and assistance helping customers become acquainted and trusting of the ATMs. No other branch is like this; inexcusable.

I wrote the above review about a year ago. I went back to the bank yesterday at 4:30 pm after they have done substantial remodeling. There were 21 people waiting in line with 2 teller windows open. I walked thru the bank and saw several staff sitting behind desks looking into computer screens, clueless as to the line of people waiting for a teller. Once again, I could see that people waiting in line were trying to deposit checks, etc., things that can easily be done at the ATM, but there was no one available to help them understand how the ATM works. Shame on you BOA and what you unnecessarily put your customers through.< /Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>The line lasts forever! The worst part is that some people don't line up where they are supposed to and they create a second line and cut in front of those who have been waiting for a while. The bank tellers don't do anything about it and still call them up. This makes the wait time twice as long because the tellers accept them in a pattern with them calling from the real line and then switching to the cutter's line and then to the real line.<//text><user_name>Andres Valencia< /user_name>< gmapID>

I am Bank of America for over 15 years . And I definitely went on this worse branch today . Lazy people . I was trying to get a new temporary card . Because by a bofamerica mistake they cancel my card . Many mistakes in this 15 years . I am done !!!The branch close at 6 pm and I get there 5:35  . And big lady told me the services was all ready close .
For sure I will close my account ! I really recommend Wells Fargo Bank I do have another savings account over there for over 10 years and I never get bad experience .</Review>

My recent experience with young staff has been poor but this place is different. The guys that work here care about the place. The service is great.   The food is delicious. They have Philly cheese steaks , pizza, sandwiches and so much more. The wings are delicious. And the blue cheese is incredible, there are chunks of cheese inside of the dressing. This place is a must if you live in the valley or are visiting. Thanks guys for working hard to keep this place nice!</Text>

Good guys work here.
In the photo is my double meat Philly with onions pepper and shrooms wit wiz. Fries piping hot AND crisp. don't mind my acquired taste of mayo and Sriracha over them. I will be returning.

Double meat is overkill btw I was just eating after a 24hr fast< /review>

<review>I am from Philly and this has been the best cheese steak I had since moving here a few months ago. I would have gave 5 stars but only thing they need to do is add a tad bit more meat to the sandwich and then it would be perfect. The young lady that took and cooked my order was sweet as well.</review>< GmapID>

<Review>Was in the mood for a Philly Cheesteak and heard they have the best. I walked in and there was 1 other customer in this place. The 2 people at the front were nice but you can tell they are there for the money. Paid for 2 drinks and there soda machine was out of order so just grabbed a large soda out of the fridge they have. I can make a better cheesteak at home. There was nothing special about it. They have a B rating. Take your money else where this is a joke of a Philly Cheesteak..< /Review>< Pics>

Soda machine broken for last 3 months apparently.   They dont mention that when ordering.    The fries are barely adequate but The cheesesteaks are excellent and well worth ordering though< /Text>

<review>Ordering from Downtown Philly was quick and easy. I had a haircut at the adjacent salon and was able to order even before my haircut was done. On top of it, the server delivered my Philly Cheese Steak without me even asking them. Customer service was great! The cheese steak sandwich was a little bland and basic. The service offset whatever was lacking in taste.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Ordered a sandwich with extra meat... they charge 3 bucks, no worries, but 3 bucks got me one extra slice per half! Although the sandwich is decent, Caveretta's & Cricca blow this place out of the water! This place is in single A and the other two are in the big leagues! Even Dans subs kills them and they are a Double A sandwich shop! So I like to try mom & pop spots as apposed to chains... but because of the lack of comparing to the others and the SEVERE CHEAPNESS I will never eat here again!<//Text>

Yes, please! Looking for a not greasy hoagie?? This is the place!! Want awesome service? This is also the place! Want yummy fries that's accompanied by a healthy portion of quality ranch dip? Again, THIS IS THE PLACE!!!

Found this on Yelp on a whim and glad to have come across it! The hubs was concerned that it was going to be greasy like how usual cheesesteaks tend to be... glad we didn't let that worry stop us because we wouldn't have found this place!

They serve other items as well--such as pizza, wings, salads, etc.

On top of the tasty food, the service was EXCELLENT!!

If you're looking for a quick and delish bite to eat, come here!!!</review>

<Review>Best Philly cheese steak in the valley and they do it with wiz. They may take time to get the food out but it's worth it.

**UPDATE** February 2019
Will never go back.  Ordered a Cheesesteak and asked for wiz. They physically looked in the fridge and said yes they have it.  While I get a drink I noticed 3 out of the 8 soda fountains and 2 of the 4 iced teas have signs saying not in stock or out of order. 5 minutes after sitting down I'm told there is no wiz and ask me if if I would like American. Sure I say, yellow American cheese.  I'm told there is no yellow Ameeican . . . Then why ask what cheese I want if all you have is one type of cheese? White American . .    I also ordered a cheeseburger for my son.  Only extra item he wanted was pickles.  Yep, 5 minutes into sitting down we're told no pickles.  This starts to become more than a reoccurring theme.  Cheeseburger came 10 minutes after the cheese steak. Cheese was not melted and actually did not look fresh or edible. We left with only one bite of the cheeseburger.

Obviously they have issues to sort out but I'll take my business elsewhwere.</Review>< Pics>

I've been hunting for good Philly cheese steak sandwiches for as long as I can remember. I've tried almost every place that serves these sandwiches from Santa Barbara to van nuys. I finally no longer have to drive to McMasters at UCSB to get a great Philly cheese steak sandwich.

This place nailed it. Soft delicious roll, perfectly sliced and grilled ribeye, veggies, and of course, the wiz. The flavors are perfectly balanced, and the sandwich is constructed very well. Good proportions of vegetables to meat and bread, juicy but not soggy.

What really sets this place apart from all the rest is the absolutely amazing staff. I called them about six minutes before they were closing on a Saturday, the person who answered was friendly, and sounded genuinely happy about the fact that I wanted to place an order for pickup. I told them I was about 10 minutes away, and asked if it was still okay to place the pickup order, and was told to not worry about it and just to come on in. That really made me feel good about ordering.

When I arrived the place was still buzzing with customers and my order was almost ready. By the time I finished paying, it was done. Do yourself a favor and come try the food at this place, you won't be disappointed.</Text>

Bad experience I've.  I ordered a meat lovers pizza. I waited 30 min to get my pizza. Bread was hard. Cheese and toppings were burned.</Text>

<text>Fix Auto is the leader when it comes to fast service, good pricing, and customer service. I came in for a door fix and they were able to fix my door within 10 minutes! Rodger was the guy who helped me and he even showed me what was wrong with my vehicle in detail. He is incredibly nice and I would definitely come here again and recommend this shop to anyone who wants the best service for their vehicle.<//text>< username>

<text>I took my pick up truck there because Allstate insurance sent me, I recently find out that there is a broken Plastic clip on my right mirror that they just pretended that I’ll never find out and the mirror gasket is showing when is supposed to be hidden also when I pull the car fax they posted that my car had substantial damage not specify when the truck only had been keyed on the passenger side no dents or body damage! Now you can understand my thoughts are when I try to sell it not happy!!<//text><date>1621576885852</date>< response>

My catalytic converter on my Honda CRV was tampered with, couldn’t drive it. I spoke with Roger from Fix Auto, he was very professional and helpful. Roger worked with my insurance company, scheduled a tow truck to pick up my car. Roger kept in contact with me throughout the fix and then explained to me that my catalytic wasn’t stolen, just needed to be welded back together. They fixed my car in less than a day. They also cleaned my car inside and out. I highly recommend Roger and Fix Auto for any car issues and repairs, I am very satisfied with their work and customer service< /text>

<Time>1603843008209<//Time><Text>Apparently this is my local Volvo-Certified Collision Center, and I took my Volvo here after I got side-swiped and received a long, shallow paint scratch. I was thinking it had to be repainted, but they told me, the paint scratches would likely polish out, and they started on that immediately—was not waiting very long at all. After 2 quick sessions with the polisher, the paint scratch came right out. They specifically told me I didn’t need to pay them anything for the polishing, but I still feel bad that their services went uncompensated, so the least I can do is leave a positive review for them here. Will recommend this place for anyone needing the services of a body shop in the future.<//Text>< user>

I like that they keep you updated on your vehicle with text messages. They also send you a breakdown of everything that they are doing to your car and they also are flexible. I was out of town when my due date came up and I called and asked them if I they could keep the car until I came back and they were fine with that.< /review>

They are the nicest group of guys.  It feels right leaving my car there.  I know that if there is any change they ASAP contact me and advise.   The fact that are on the ball with keeping in the loop is #1 with me.
Oh yea and they do excellent body work and paint matching
I will always use them for any work I may need on my car in the future.< /Text>

I've taken my cars to auto fix back when they were BMC. Roger is the man! He provides nothing but outstanding customer service. He's there to answer all your questions and gives provides constant updates. Not only have they done great work on my car, but everytime I've taken my vehicle to them, the job is done quickly. If I could give them ten starts I would! I highly recommend them.</Review>

< review>
Thank you BMC!  I was not disappointed with USAA's recommendation.  The stress and finance during holidays are enough to deal with and to add a car in the repair shop can weigh heavily.  But you put my mind at ease with your customer service skills and you took care of me.  Your friendly and welcoming atmospheres from the front door service to repair estimates and all the way to end of the service gives me great joy.  I was happy with the result.

Thank you, again!  Have a wonderful new year!< /review>

<Review>Roger from BMC, he hooked me up... this dude really knows his stuff and took great care of me, made me feel like I was one of his homies.. took my car parts in and noticed that there was some damage and fixed it no problems and shaved some cost. Even though that's not what I was asking for but with that being said. This place I will only take my cobra to, I even have other crew members and family member going to his shop. Highly recommend place to paint your car/truck what ever you need painted. Just ask for roger he will hook you up...

BMC did a horrible job with customer service I originally took my car in the middle of the month of February and they gave me an estimate of 3 days, to repair my car: 3 weeks latter,$2165.00 and 6 days ofter their second estimate I still have not received my car, I don't care about the new cost because I have insurance and all I have to pay is my deductible but this is causing problems with my rent-a-car, and the day they told my insurance company they would have my car done.<//Text>

<user>114660983635085777883< /user><review>Antonio Bianca and Brenda are amazing and very kind. They are great at explaining your account and answering any questions. I cant say that much for Selena who is a manager there. Very arrogant and needs to practice being more personable. Customers are getting loans for a reason. Hardships could be anything from medical to a loss of a loved one. She needs to be more careful with her words. Honestly I am surprised she has a mangement role. Ive spoken to her twice and until I asked for her name she changed her tone. Dont hesitate to ask for Brenda Bianca or Antonio. Thank you guys for being so sweet and understanding.</review><Response>{'time': 1614901628447, 'text': 'Glad to hear everything went well for you.

I really appreciate how they always remember me and greet me by name, even if it's been a few months in between me needing to borrow again. Everyone at this location are so friendly, welcoming, and patient. They treat all their customers with the same care and consideration. Thank you, because after seeing guys after my busy work day especially at the end of the month, I always have a good little talk and you all make my day a bit brighter!</text></record></dataset><record>

She helped me get current and once I was back on track, they were able to help fund me when I got into a sticky situation.

Quick and fast cash! Call and they will run an application over the phone! Email options to send over documents and just walk in to make the loan and get funded! I recommend to everyone! Just call!!! Very fast!!!<//review>

Was hesitant at first but came out with the funds I needed. I had no clue they work with older vehicles for title loans. I thought my possibilities of obtaining a larger loan with not the best credit were slim, but this place turned it around for me. Appreciate the service and helping me with my financial needs. Go or call if you're in need of money!<//review>

(Translated by Google) If you are in need of money this is the best place for loans. They are very friendly and explain the contract in detail. I am a client of them since I was 4 years old and I would never dare to go anywhere else. They are very understandable and if I occupy one more day to give my payment they wait for me. I am very satisfied with your services.

I went in to have a screen shield put on my phone. Elpidio was friendly, helpful and managed to put the shield on while helping others on the phone. Very knowledgeable and the price was right. If i had bought from a large commercial cell phone store, it would have been 3 times as much.<//text>

Victor was super kind and helpful- he helped me fix my phone no one else could (the Apple store was closed due to Covid and my cell service provider was unsure of what to do). Phone is working great now and it didn’t cost me an arm & a leg. Will definitely be going back when needed.</Review>

I had a broken screen repair done for my daughter's iPhone recently and it came out very well but unfortunately her screen was cracked again due to an accident. When I called and explained the situation, an employee Jasmine was very helpful in making things right. When I went to have the work done she was not there however Victor was outstanding with his customer service and he fixed my daughter's phone which of course made her happy and me as well. Good people that work here! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for phone repair and even phone accessories!!< /review>

This was my first time using this service , I needed to fix my smartwatch and it needed an exchange of battery. I called Battery plus who referred them to me. I contacted the person on the phone Merriah , she told me they could fix my problem which they did ! Merriah was very professional and cordial at the same time , she fixed my smartwatch saving me a lot of money for replacement of a smartwatch,! I highly recommend Repair All and give great marks to them and technician Marriah !!

< Review>
I had my screen replaced here and it worked really well. Fantastic instal and fast! Fast forward two months.... I had my air pods in my pocket with my phone, hopped in my truck and it broke the screen.... not the screen protector they installed... the actual seeen. I called them about warranty and they told me they would give me a discount on a new screen that’s I. No warranty whatsoever. Great people.... awful product. I would not suggest paying this much money for inferior replacement screen that breaks so quickly. Try somewhere else.</Review>

<review>My phones been cracked for months and finally gave up. Called around and this was the only store open and they even offered a discount. When I arrived the worker Gisel was professional and even helped show me I also needed a new battery. Repair didn’t take too long and my phones back to new. Will return in with any other products I have in the future.</review><pics>None<//pics>< username>

<resp>None< /resp><review>The techs Victor and Timothy at RepairALL are always very polite, knowledgeable and efficient! I've had three Samsung Galaxy phones repaired at the Clovis location within the last two years; they needed the glass screens to be replaced because I drop my phone a lot. I appreciate RepairALL's quick service and I trust their work. Also, I have been able to get the repairs done for about the same price as an insurance claim would cost me through my phone contract, without the extra monthly charge on my bill. I recommend RepairALL to anyone that needs glass replacemenst on their smartphones.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I called 1 hour before closing to inquire about repairing the screen in my iPhone X. The person I spoke with was very nice. I told him I would go in on Saturday since it was almost closing time and I didn’t have time after work. He invited me to go ahead and come on in.When I arrived he got right to work on my phone, it took about 15 minutes.

I called this place by accident but I’m glad I did. They were cheaper than the other place, more convenient, and definitely a lot more experienced.<//Text>< GmapID>

Walked into Repair All  after calling the previous evening on pricing. Tim was welcoming and provided great customer service. Found out I didn’t need the repair quoted, ( the charging port was cleaned free of charge and this solved my initial problem). He showed me that my battery was not performing optimally and suggested that I replace it. There was no pressure to do it just a suggestion. It was at this point I could have walked out, problem fixed with zero money spent.
For the reason listed above, I chose to have them preform the battery replacement and purchased two chargers and a phone case. Due to their customer service and honesty I will continue to frequent this business when I have phone issues.<//Text>

I walked in, was greeted very promptly by two individuals. Sign in was simple and they had repair finished faster than I was able to even come back to get it. I would take my device here again and would recommend others to do the same. Thanks Victor< /Review>

Pete was very impressive because of his great personality and his technician experience that he brought to the repair. He was more than just a phone repair man, He made the experience more palatable. We visited and he convinced me to replace my battery and add a screen protector. He also encouraged me to keep this phone.

<review>Victor was very helpful. My I-70 phone was wet. ( I slipped in my pond & fell on my butt. Water up to my armpits)
I brought it in & victor did the paperwork & said it’d be an hour if...if.. if.
So i waited. He finished the previous customer’s iPad. Then he immediately went to my Phone to dry it quickly. He took it apart, blew it out, did whatever else, cleaned the speakers & microphone & I had him replace the battery.
He cleaned & made it perfect.
Thanks.

Victor was working by himself on a Sunday evening. He was busy with several other clients merchandise.
He wanted to accomplish the company motto “30 minute service” But he was by himself! He still managed to get my phone done in less than an hour, and explained the 1 year warranty thoroughly before showing sincere courteous appreciation for my business.</text>

<review>I broke my iPhone 7+ screen and didn’t want to go to a place across town my friends were suggesting so I decided to try RepairALL at Sierra Vista mall. It was great! The guy was really nice and FAST! He thought it was going to take 45 minutes but it only took 20. Luckily they had my screen on hand. Maybe it WAS my screen but I was having a difficult time with my hearing speaker when my phone was not on speaker but somehow that was fixed too. He put on a screen protector and made sure there were NO bubbles or dust. They did everything they could to help me out and give me a good price. I definitely recommend RepairALL for your needs! They are also one of the few companies open Sundays.<//review>< Pics>

Refered to this business by the Verizon store across from it. I had an issue with my SD card. My phone stopped recognizing my card but when plugged into my computer an "error" message came up - thankfully I was able to save my files! A tech at RepairALL  removed my card and put in one of his cards. My phone recognized it right away therefore "the fix" was a new card. VIOLA! Problem solved! Next issue was a delay that occured when people called me. Callers told me they could BARELY hear me. Then tech said that this happens if dirt/dust gets into the small microphone opening. He cleaned and tested it and VIOLA! Problem solved! Great customer service!!! Super nice technicians!!! HIGHLY recommend!< /text>

<review>Very impressed by this phone repair store. They are very reasonable priced and fast service. . I had a quote from another place and it was twice as much. It wasn’t my phone that the screen was replaced.  However, it was my son’s and I bought him a case as well. I would go back if I have the need to.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Took my iPhone in for a cracked screen. Great customer service and he explained what he was going to do and how long it would take. The super cool thing,  I looked up the reviews and it gave me the option to chat so I was able to get a quote (great price) and let him know what time I would be in.< /Review><userid>118180406110885344711<//userid><Rating>5< /Rating><pics>None</pics><name>Carolyn galvan</name>< resp>

Fantastic service and knowledgeable in all that they do.
Took iPhone 5 and Samsung Note 5 in for repair. iPhone needed new screen and battery and Note 5 for tempered glass screen protector.
Joe had all parts in stock with both phones repaired in less than an hour.
He also gave us very good pricing as the had a special on the LCD screen assembly.
Would highly recommend RepairALL Phone repair.
Great communication, service, and repair.</review>

I went in for a phone repair, but my phone still had a warranty repair through the carrier. The person was very informative on the matter. Even tho they didn’t not get my business then, I came back to them for a case and screen cover. Because I wanted to return the help and give them my business.</Text>

After it was repaired, I was constantly having problems with the screen not being responsive to my finger and just thought it was normal for a repaired phone. I didn't drop the phone, it was actually protected in a nice case. Last week I went to make a call and the screen was fading blue, I made the call and set the phone down. When I picked it up 10 minutes later it was so blue I couldn't recognize any of the apps on the screen. I powered it down, turned it back on and nothing. Then about an hour later it was completely black and could not be used. I took my phone back there and explained the problem. The person behind the counter just blew me off and said, well we can replace it again but I have to charge you?? It was a faulty screen. After arguing with him he said he was going to contact the supervisor to see if there was anything that could be done. I waiting in the lobby for over 20 minutes for him to tell me they could replace it and the great deal I was going to get was the same price as all their competitors. So I am supposed to pay them again the same price as if I went to a competitor. Needless to say I took the phone somewhere else and had the screen replaced. It works great now. No problem with the screen being unresponsive anymore. I would suggest you ship elsewhere so you don't have to waste the time and money.. I will definitely be writing reviews on all platforms! Thanks for the troubles!</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1566854578343, 'text': "Hi, I am the manager of this establishment. I am deeply sorry for the situation you had with the screen. Due to your screen having deep scratches and also underneath the glass your LCD being cracked, which is the cause of your screen going out on you, unfortunately these damages voids the warranty as stated on your receipt so we could not warranty your screen. I understand you're upset but please understand that these damages do not happen out of thin air. Something has to have caused your LCD to get damaged and the fact that your screen also had deep scratches tells us it was caused due to impact. I was kind enough to reach out to my VP district manager and he was willing to make you an offer to only charge you for the price of the part meaning we would not make any profit as no labor would be charged. That offer still stands so feel free to stop on by if you would like. Again, my deepest apologies but we cannot warranty a damaged screen. Thank you for understanding."}<//resp>< gmap_id>

Upon leaving a bad review the manager Victor quickly contacted me to ask what caused me to leave such a bad review.  After explaining my situation to Victor he said to bring the phone back to the store and he himself would personally take care of it. They were very apologetic and explain to me everything they were looking at while doing the repair and the repair came out perfect. They are very professional, personable, and above all customer oriented they have my business for any future problems with electronics!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1557018533335, 'text': 'Thank you for allowing me to resolve your issue.

I really liked this store. They didn’t rush to dismiss me  and right away reinforce me they would do everything possible to get my phone working again. Apple wanted $600 they fixed it for under $200. I went to the Applestore first  to fix my IPhone X. I was there for about 5 minutes and they told me it would be better to get a new one and that it would cost around $600 to fix it. I felt dismissed. All they wanted was the most money possible. At the Repairall store the technicians  were quick, efficient, inexpensive and friendly as well. Highly recommend!!!< /text>

Came in with an iPhone that wouldn't charge. Clerk at the front asked a couple of questions and asked to see the phone. He tinkered with it for a bit and plugged it in, and it worked! Declined any payment for it, was just doing a good deed! 10/10 customer service!</Text>

Came in with an iPhone that wouldn't charge. Clerk at the front asked a couple of questions and asked to see the phone. He tinkered with it for a bit and plugged it in, and it worked! Declined any payment for it, was just doing a good deed! 10/10 customer service!<//Review>

<Review>I contacted them via Yelp and received a reply very quickly. I was offered a discounted sale price which I appreciated very much. The person working was quite busy so it did take a little longer then expected however I am very pleased with the work done and the price.
I would recommend this place to friends and family.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Oh, my...  Of course, l was devastated about the possibility that my phone, that was on without ability to do more, was DOA.  However, just two hours after the biz took in my phone, it was miraculously FIXED!  The cable had completely detachwd in the short fall.  Elated is tooooo small of an adjective.  I was over-the-moon!

Thank you a million times.

Will refer your shop to everyone.
Again, thanks so much.  HB<//Text>

Excellent screen replacement done on my Samsung S10. Just wish that they didn't have to order the screen and it took a week.< /Review>

Great experience -- dropped my phone in the morning, screen wasn't working, was afraid I had to buy a new phone, found their business on google, took it in, they had it done under 30 minutes. Price was well worth it for their great service and the overall value of my phone. Lesson learned: Don't place phone on any sketchy high surfaces where it can fall and make the screen go all crazy and not working.< /review>

Amazing service! The manager Adrian is a great guy and I was able to connect with him and receive a great deal. I was at the T-Mobile across the street and the screen on my iPhone 6S was completely broken off and they sent me to RepairAll because they knew he'd give a good deal. Everything was done for $150 in about 30 minutes!<//text>

<Text>First visit here was great, fast and easy.
Second time got a different person and took a lot longer, was told 30-45 mins took a little over an hour. The tempered glass cover got put on with a big fiber in the middle, he got another one and put it on but still had a couple spots in it .. not a big deal but kind of annoying when I just spent over $200... I’d go back if I needed another repair..< /Text><Response>{'time': 1522430712638, 'text': 'we are sorry for the inconvenience come stop by the store and well go ahead and put a new tempered glass free of charge :) have awesome day'}< /Response><user_id>106880180014451336173<//user_id><gmap_id>0x80945b8971f4c95d:0x60eb920e851a53d0<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>I had a freeze on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 after trying to sign a tax return form. I took it back to the Verizon store where I had bought the phone, but they told me their store doesn't do repairs, they could send a refurbished one in a couple of weeks. I said I would try an independent phone repair shop. They suggested RepairALL just a few stores away. The RepairALL tech found a website that gave instructions on how to do a hard reset without removing the back to disconnect the battery.  Shazam! It worked🙂 I asked how much and he said it didn't take any time so no charge, but I gave him $20 for his knowledge it was worth more than that.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80945b8971f4c95d:0x60eb920e851a53d0<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

People were nice and we're quick to repair my phone. Screen quality is not the same as my old screen. It works fine and everything, but the colors seem slightly washed out.</Review>

<resp>{'time': 1557875377176, 'text': "I'm sorry that our price made you feel the need to leave us a 1-star review. Have you read our Google reviews? You can see in our reviews lots of our customers appreciate the good work we do here. We do have a 4.5 star rating for a reason and that's because we use USA premium parts (not from China) that comes with lifetime warranty and with our certified technicians we make sure we get the job done right with the proper tools we have and that's something people would pay a premium for. Please understand that diagnosing a device takes a long time. We have to check every single component which the device may contain 10-15 of and that may take 3-24 hours depending on the type of diagnoses. We don't want to just dive in there and start yanking things out and installing new things to see what works and doesn't. We want to take our time for diagnoses to make sure it's done right. We factor in time, labor and cost of parts to come up with a price. Depending on the issue I may be able to offer some kind of deal. What was the issue you were having with your device? I would even diagnose the device for free depending on what the issue is. We wish to help everyone we can but there are limits. The question is, what would it take for me to earn your business? Let me know, I hope to hear from you - Management"}< /resp>< Text>
wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone... overpriced for an adequate job... they were going to charge me a significant amount just to diagnose my apple product...<//Text>

<review>Great service I went in yesterday in the afternoon to replace my battery on my Samsung S7. Elpidio V. was the one who helped me he quoted me 74.99 and They actually had a $30 dollar off discount which he applied it to my bill. I am out the door with new battery replaced at a cost of almost $50! Such a great service battery on my phone is lasting longer. Great service no damage whatsoever.</review>< date>

Okay as far as the repair they did an awesome job but as far as the service not-so-good Belcourt you a certain amount of time but then it takes twice as long and then when they put the film cover over the top they leave nothing but air bubbles but as far as them fixing it and it turned out good</review>

It was pretty fast, I was expecting for maybe next day pickup, and my galaxy s8 which I cracked last year and replaced looked brand new again, but it was expensive. The damage to the phone was extensive though, I thought it was beyond repair.</review>

My iPhone was not charging. The repair guy just cleaned the charge port and it worked. He was very knowledgeable and help. I will be using the service again in the future.< /Review>

When the girl in there put my screen protector on, she put on crooked and didn’t smooth all the air out from underneath. I’m thinking of going to get my money back and just buying a better brand of plexiglass at Walmart for half the price they charged me.</text>

Took my iPad in to have a the start up button replace and they said that the battery needed to be replaced also. They said it would be ready in an hour but I didn’t get it back until 4 hours later. Got it home to charge up new battery which then the iPad would not start at all. I return it the following day and I was told that the new battery was bad and they would have to order a another battery which would take a week to come in. Now it’s been over a month and I’ve being told that they’re still working on it and don’t know what’s wrong.</review>
