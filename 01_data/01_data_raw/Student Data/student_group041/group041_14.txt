I did this for my birthday about two months ago and wow that was such a memorable and unique experience just an hour east of DTLA! The hike itself is already an adventure as you ford the San Gabriel river many times to arrive at this historic bridge. Trekking through the canyon is so beautiful too. I can't say enough about the Bungee America staff, we had an awesome person named Alex who gave the whole group a prep talk before we started the hike and got everyone super amped up and gave some cool history about the area.

For the actual bungee jump experience, it was both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time but I felt completely safe doing it. YOU GOTTA DO IT, it made me feel alive!! I did the two jump package which is the way to go since both jumps are a way different experience - did the superman front dive and the backwards starfish. Also it was really awesome meeting Ron, the founder of Bungee America and he was actually very involved with everything from safety protocol and keeping the energy high. Highly recommend doing this! It's one you won't forget :)</Text>

I should’ve done this review earlier when all the names were fresh in my mind. I’m sorry! My brother gifted me Bungee jumping for my birthday in April. We went April 11 I believe. From beginning to end, it was amazing! The guys were amazing! At check-in there was a very friendly fellow Aries that wished me a Happy Birthday. There was also a very nice guy teasing my husband about eating donuts on the hike, which was hilarious. The group leader was nice too. He definitely made us keep up! I do remember Chris. He did my countdown for my jumps. He was amazing! So sweet and such a great hype man. My brother volunteered to go first and I went second that day and everyone was great. I would definitely love to do this again. I just have to wear much more comfortable hiking shoes because I bruised about 3 toe nails. So wear comfortable shoes! Love the t-shirt. I wear it with so much pride! One of the best experiences of my life! Thanks guys!< /Review>

Bridge to nowhere is one of the sickest places for Bungee, and Bungee America crew is hands down the best crew to accommodate this crazy adventure. The 5 mile hike is just the beginning of the exciting day ahead, once you reach to the bridge it all starts getting real. For all the brave Adrenaline rush seekers, this is your spot!
Thanks to Ron and his Crew for a Sunday for the Books! 👌🏼✌🏼<//Review>

Best experience of our lives! I’ve always considered myself to be an impulse trill seeker and this one really pushes the limits. While the scariest thing I’ve ever done it was also the most rewarding.. after your back in solid ground! The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and you honestly don’t think about the 10 mile hike when in the moment. I would defiantly do this again!! See you soon!< /text>

The hike and bungee jumping was truly the highlight of my entire trip to LA. The entire experience was so seamlessly put together by an extremely impressive staff. It was also so cool to learn the long history behind the company and the origins of bungee jumping. Initially, I wasn’t planning on jumping at all but the staff took their time to explain and prove to me just how safe it was....so much so that I ended up jumping TWICE. Such an insanely cool experience that I can’t stop thinking about!!!<//Review>

<Text>Literally the best experience of my life. Didn’t feel scared or insecure once. All the staff rocked. Did 3 jumps and even a back flip because it was so awesome. 5 stars isn’t enough. Points to Alex and Ron supporting everyone that jumped and making it super fun. These people are knowledgeable and know how to have a good time. Love y’all<//Text>< user_name>

Such an incredible experience! 1000/10 would recommend!!
Bungee jumping has been on my bucket list for ages and I was finally able to do it with the Bungee America team. They were absolutely incredible! Helped guide us to the bridge at a brisk walk and made the whole experience so enjoyable and memorable with tons of light banter and humor to distract everyone from the cold river you had to cross several times. They ran a whole jump course before we jumped to show us the proper way to jump without getting hurt and then double and even triple checked to make sure all harnesses and stuff were in place to keep us safe. I jumped 3 times and would DEFINITELY return to jump some more. Eventually… when I find my guts again..</review>

<Text>If you are looking to jump off of a bridge then hands down Bungee America is the place to go! If I could give them more than 5 stars I would! Their staff clearly loves what they do. They make it so fun from the moment you check in until the day is over. Safety is their number one priority and I felt completely safe in their hands. I went back the very next weekend after my first jump, because I had such a great time!
I can’t wait to go back again soon!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Bungee America was a GREAT experience!!! The instructors were super fun from beginning to end, kept us informed and safe. The hike to the bridge was beautiful as well!! I was hesitant about jumping when I arrived, but the instructors made me feel super comfortable and excited for the jump and I'm SO glad I did it!! I highly recommend this experience, can't wait to be back :)</Text>

< Review>
Jumped on 4/24 and let me tell you, this experience was the most fun I’ve had in a while and one that I will never forget. The hike is lovely with a beautiful river and canyon views. The founder Ron is super engaging and provides great context regarding the precise science behind bungee jumping—I felt extremely safe and knowledgeable about what to do after his presentation which was fun and informative at the same time. The guys, whose names I can’t remember but were all wonderful, did a great job of answering my questions, making me feel safe and HYPED for the jump. The jump is super smooth and feels like you are flying; I personally did not get a stomach-dropping feeling. The moment right BEFORE the jump was scariest, looking out into the canyon, but I had nothing to fear— the jump was SO FUN! And since then, any time I am scared of something (like rollercoasters, etc) I remind myself that I have jumped off a bridge and the fear melts away. So 10/10 for Bungee America, highly recommend and cannot wait to jump again. In life, we regret the opportunities we missed out on, so do it—you won’t regret it.</Review>

I loved the experience! The employees at bungee America make the experience even better. I doubted jumping but they reassured me that it was perfectly safe. They convinced me and my siblings to jump and we’re all glad we did. It is one of my absolute favorite memories, I totally recommend and I would do it again< /text>

<text>The experience is just amazing starting off with a beautiful hike. Hiking last one mile is daunting but it’s well worth as soon as you are on nowhere bridge. I am super scared of heights but Ron, Chris and Alex were so patient and made me feel so safe. I couldn’t have jumped off if not for them.</text>< pictures>

When I found out we could bungee jump off the bridge I was super stoked! I appreciate that Ron and his crew guided us throughout the hike to the bridge. They were super energetic and easygoing! Once we got to the bridge, we got the full rundown of all the jumps we could do and how to do them properly. At first, I was only going to do one jump but then decided to add on another jump right before. Ron and his crew definitely made the experience much more memorable.
Also, they do not pressure you to jump or add jumps, and if you decide to back down they are super understanding!
Will definitely be coming back soon!

P.S. you get a free shirt! And the quality is 💯</Text>< Pictures>

<text>My 2 friends surprised me for my birthday with bungee jumping. The hike starts early in the morning. The day I happened to go, they tried something different with who gets to jump first. If you had got there early for check in you had priority to jump, vs if you got there late, you were the last of the group to jump. I recommend getting there as early as possible because parking can be difficult and it’s usually a big group that jumps so you’d wait about 1-2 hours before you can jump if you’re checking in late. On the hike to the bridge, you’ll pass the waterfall several times so maybe take extra socks and shoes that are comfortable and you don’t care about. There is a short break in between the hike. Once you get to the bridge you’ll attend bungee jumping school where they teach you the safety of jumping and some cool and fun stories. Some of the stories include world records they been a part of. Be sure to pay attention because there are rules to ensure you have a safe, amazing, Instagram worthy jump. All of the staff made me feel beyond safe, were very polite and easy to talk to. You might decide to jump more than once when you get up there & you can do so. I highly recommend it though because Every jump is different. Each staff double checks you’re tied to your harness correctly and will even tell you what is the purpose for each buckle. After your jump, you’ll receive a t shirt as a token for jumping. Since the staff alone made me feel safe i will 100% go again. The hike is overall 10 miles (to the bridge and back) it is beautiful, you might see big horn sheep and snakes on the way. be careful it can get a little steep at times. Take water and some snacks. Don’t hesitate to jump with bungee America at the bridge to nowhere. You wont regret it!🤙🏼</text>< time>

Ron was amazing in helping me purchase this gift and answering all of my questions. The hike/jump was surprise gift for my other half and it was one of his all time favorite experiences. Cannot recommend the Bridge to Nowhere hike/jump enough. Entire staff was super knowlegable and amazing. Already planning our next visit.< /text>

We had a great time hiking up to the bridge and back. My wife purchased two jumps for her and I. Our guide Chris was amazing, funny and understanding with everyone who feared taking the leap. He made us feel comfortable and safe. I almost chickened out and came back over the ledge where Chris convinced me and calmed my nerves and I took the jump twice. I’m not going to lie I’m torn on giving the amount of stars that I’m giving because overall we had a good time but I want this Review to be seen.

We had the “luxury” to sit through three of Ron’s speeches with three groups. From 6am to 5pm. I say luxury because he chose my wife last to take the jump for the 6am team. When my wife showed fear he made no attempt to help her out or calm her instead he was rude to her by telling her that the reason he made her go last was because he knew she wasn’t going to jump. When my wife said ok just give me a chance he told her no. He made her get out of the gear and walked away. After her telling him “you’re really not going to give me a chance” he replied fine I’ll give you another chance but we had to wait until what turned out to be the end of the day.

I get you have many people trying to jump and you have a business to run but you have to understand that people signed up because they want to do it but the fear to do it is real. I almost gave up and it took Chris a minute to calm my nerve. I also overheard Ron tell one of your crew members that the people who show fear ruin it for everyone else and that’s why you pick people who you think won’t show fear in the beginning to start the day so others would follow, which i understand but people are not paying for a cheap service so I think you owe them a bit of understanding.

Ron I know many people love you and the opportunity you offer but you can be a bit more human and understanding. I say more human because like I said earlier we had the opportunity to hear three of your speeches and I realize you are a good actor because you show emotion in what you do but everything you said was repetitive including your laugh and your hand movements. So much that I could pretty much could do the speech for you.

Anyway my low stars is not to discourage anyone from taking the hike or taking the jump in fact it was a great experience up until our experience with Ron.

Great job to Chris!!!< /review>

<text>I jumped off a bridge with my new found girl group "Blaque Girls Hike - Los Angeles"! It was an amazing experience. I got the best bloopers, haha! I can't stress enough how exhilarating this event is. First you hike through the mountains enjoying nature. Then you walk through the river 12 times! It was by far the best hike I've ever done. You don't even notice you hiked 10 miles in total because the views are so breathtaking. I recommend doing this at least once in your life.</text>< Time>

<text>I am the cofounder of @LaBaddiesFitnessClub and helped organize a trail clean up to the bridge to nowhere. The owner of Bungee America sponsored our event by disposing the trash and gifting a free bungee jump to one lucky winner. Thank you guys for letting one of our members have this unique experience. Definitely a must do if you are in the area!!< /text>< pics>

<text>Amazing experience with an amazing guide. I would recommend Bungee America to add to any bucket list. The experience and memory will last me a lifetime. As the guide says at the start of the trip, “leave it better than you found it.” Pick up trash on the way out.

<username>Andrew Poullath<//username><review>I’m still trying to find words to describe the weekend I spent at The Bridge to Nowhere. Possibly the best weekend of my life but not just because of the life changing activity of hiking to a bridge and then jumping off of it, but the incredible hosting by the owner Ron. I love intense sports but I’ve never experienced bungee jumping. I couldn’t have found a better place and people to experience my first jump! Ron had tents set up with surprisingly comfortable bed pads for a tent and basic necessities like water and a mini grill to cook the food we brought. Not taking away from the incredible camping experience. Big thanks to Ron and Alex as well as the rest of the staff that made this experience a memory I will never forget. If I had notes for things they could improve they would take them with an open mind but I can’t think of anything I’d change. If anyone I know is looking to go bungee jumping I’m sending them here and I highly recommend doing more than one jump. You will not regret it!!< /review><time>1605482432497< /time>< user_id>

Had a great experience with Bungee America! The staff is very knowledgeable and employs the use of multiple safeguards in their processes and procedures. They do a thorough job of explaining the equipment to jumpers and emphasizing what jumpers can do to get the best bungee jump.

The staff did inform us that there was a meeting time to get together with the entire group to hike out to the Bridge to Nowhere. The pace is about a mile in 20 minutes. It is best to keep in mind that this is not moderate terrain, and you will get a cardio workout out of this hike at this pace. If someone doesn't want to move at this pace or isn't able to, then they don't have to. People are able to hike out to the Bridge to Nowhere at their own pace and sign up for a jump at the bridge.

The people running this business did not turn anyone away from jumping. If they were at the bridge and wanted to jump, then they were able to sign up to jump that same day. This company wants people to have a good time and, most importantly, to be safe doing so. You won't find a better crew anywhere in the states. Hope you enjoy!<//Text>

Good experience to kick off my new year challenge walking down 6 miles from this to nowhere bridge. Chris, Ron are more energetic and highly motivated. I like the Bungee jump experience and truly recommend this based on their experience and background 32 years. I am a beginner so, may be I will come one more time.< /text>

My overall experience was beyond what I was expecting. I would come back every weekend if I could. I’m so incredibly grateful I got the opportunity to get to know the amazing instructors. They were all so kind, honest, knowledgeable, and patient. The actual bungee jump was AMAZING and I wanted to go all day! (I mean.. I guess I did since I did a total of 7 jumps) it’s great because they don’t limit your jumps and are very accommodating to what you’re needing. Chris, Ron, Aki (I know I’m spelling that wrong) and alex were all wonderful to deal with and made the entire experience 1000% worth it.<//Text>

< Review>
I was late to the meetup point, but since I knew we were meeting at the bridge of nowhere I hiked by myself hoping to catch up with my bungee group. I was able to catch up with them and they were super nice to accommodate me still!! Very friendly staff and they know what they are doing definitely worth the experience!!! I’m afraid of heights and I was terrified to jump, but the whole staff made me feel so secured and welcomed that I gained the strength to jump! Definitely would do it again< /Review>

This is the only bungee place I know in the LA. To reach bridge to nowhere you need to hike up along the river and do several water crossing. It’s exciting and fun considering how much water it is. The price for bungee is $99 for the first one, and $50 for additional jump if you order online. You can also pay $120 at place to jump.</text>

<Review>BEST EXPERIANCE OF MY LIFE!
The staff was very knowledgeable about what they were doing; Ron, Alex, Chris & Aki. The hike was easy up to the point where it was uphill. Then it was probably like a mile and a half up, best to bring lots of water. YOU WILL BE CROSSING THE RIVER SO BRING EXTRA SHOES!
During all times I felt safe and comfortable. An awesome hike and an awesome experience when jumping.
I will be booking it again next month since I regret not adding the second jump!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

We hiked 5 miles to the Bridge of Nowhere to check them out before booking my husband b-day in 3 weeks.  We were down near the river having lunch while watching people jumping.  All is well until we saw the owner, Ron Jones, matched a group of hikers out from the river while yelling.  At one point, he actually grabbed one of the ladies' arm when it looked like she wasn't moving fast enough.  Not sure what happened but his action could have caused some serious injuries due to the sharp rocks, water and slippery boulders.</Text>

{'time': 1604432282606, 'text': 'Hello Thuy,\n\nFirst, Happy Early Birthday to your husband! I am glad you\'re considering spending his birthday with us.  It was a great idea to do the hike on your own and get the lay of the land and watch our bungee operations in action before scheduling your own jumps.\n\nOne of the sad realities of public review sites is that it arms individuals with the ability to lash out at businesses without fully understanding what they saw or more specifically, what they "think they saw" without so much a phone call to simply ask , "what happened?"\n\nLet\'s begin by understanding the Bridge to Nowhere and the 50 acres which surround it are PRIVATE PROPERTY.  There is NO PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY across this property.  In an effort to give back to our community, we permit hikers limited access upon our property. That means if they read and obey all signs, they are welcome to enjoy this amazing piece of southern california history.  The public need to understand this is a privilege not a right.\n\nWhat you witnessed was an unfortunate instance where a group of 12 hikers decided to hike up the river channel and directly underneath multiple signs which hang 10 feet above the river and clearly state:\nPRIVATE PROPERTY\nNO TRESPASSING PAST THIS POINT\nNO HIKING THE RIVER CHANNEL\nNO HIKING UNDER THE BRIDGE TO NOWHERE\nTURN BACK NOW !\nLOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF, CA PENAL CODE 602.\n\nWhen this group of 12 hikers decided to willfully disregard this PRIVATE PROPERTY BOUNDARY they were in violation of misdemeanor trespassing.\nWhen this group of 12 hikers then decided to hike under the Bridge to Nowhere, they elevated their violation from misdemeanor trespass to criminal trespassing because they interfered with the operation of a business, whether they meant to or not does not matter.  Our entire bungee operation was forced to come to a screeching halt for safety reasons if anyone is below the jump zone.  They created a dangerous situation by putting themselves directly below the bungee jumpers and guests who are upon the bridge and a dangerous distraction for our bungee instructors who are responsible for the safety of our bungee guests.  The hikers have therefore not only interfered with a business but with the very guests who have paid to enjoy this activity.\n\nI\'m sure you can understand that just because the public is permitted to enter the private property of Disneyland, it does not mean they can go anywhere they want and do anything they want with willful disregard for the signs that say "Keep Out", "Employees Only", etc, etc.\nWhat do you think would happen to any individual who disregarded Disneyland\'s signs?\nYou can be certain they would at the very least be escorted off the property or more likely they would be arrested and charged with trespassing.\n\nWith regard to the rest of your review; what you saw was a woman who was scared to cross over a particular portion of the trail and I offered to help her. She thanked me and readily accepted my help.  If you were paying attention , you will know she had asked me to take her hiking poles and backpack which were now in my left hand and her pack was now on my back, as I held her hand across the rocky slope.  She was scared and needed to be assisted which is precisely what I was doing.\n\nNow that you understand more clearly the events of the day, it would be very nice if you would correct your unfair review.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.\n\nWe want hikers and bungee jumpers to be safe and have a fun day at the Bridge to Nowhere.  However, we cannot tolerate criminal activity and do not allow them to stay on the property if they cannot respect our signs, our customers and our operations.  We hope you understand the seriousness of the hiker\'s actions that jeopardize their own safety and the safety of our jumpers.\n\nWe seriously hope you will consider joining us for your husband\'s birthday.\n\nRon Jones\nFounder\nBungee America'}<//Resp>

<Text>I just jumped with Bungee America 10/5/19 and I have to say I am utterly impressed with the organization, safety practices, and professionalism exhibited by the staff and Ron (owner) himself. We were fortunate to go on a day when it wasn't a large group so our wait time was totally reasonable ~1hr. I didn't mind waiting because I could watch everyone jump, take pics/videos, etc. Leading up to the big day I didn't have any issues communicating (via email and phone) with the office staff. I left messages and they returned the call promptly. Everything went smoothly including our jump. Highly recommend, and would jump again!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

I don't think I've written a review in ages, but this experience has prompted me to write one.  I was SO excited for bungee jumping.  I was in the state for a conference and made my way down the coast.  I was doing some research and came across this organization.  Afterwards, I continued my research in order to figure out whether or not I wanted to jump with them.  Everything seemed to check out.

The site stated that there was a five mile hike---OK, no worries.  I like hiking & I like exploring.  The weekend prior I was in Yosemite, and I was fine.  On my way down the coast, I did some adventuring as well.

However, despite combing the website to see if there was something that I missed AND talking to who I believe is the gentleman who owns the place, I was not informed that the hike was at a fast-pace.

I'm not from the West.  Hiking for me includes lots of grass, dirt, and trees.  Not huge rocks and possibilities of falling to one's death (ironic, since we were going bungee jumping--I know).  SO I want to make sure I'm hiking purposefully in order to get through--not jumping effortlessly around like Indiana Jones.

As an aside--I weigh only about 170-80 and am regularly active.

Despite waking up real early and making my way over there, and despite starting the hike with everybody, I had to turn back.  I was trailing behind & couldn't keep up at all.  I physically couldn't keep up.  The guide kept telling me to go faster, but I could only go so fast!

I turned around.  Nobody even attempted to let me know how to figured out how to refund my money (this was a splurge after all).  I was SO disappointed.  I really wanted to go bungee jumping.

I'm sure the jumping part is fine, but getting there . . . . . unless you grew up in the area & can easily hop around, you're not gonna keep up.  :-(< /Text>

<Text>Great experience. Planning was easy. One phone call. Instructions for preparing were clear.  Had someone meet at East fork parking lot and hike in. Bungee jumping was well organized and felt safe. A lot of fun. We planned a mid week request and a private group.  Definitely would do it again.< /Text>< Resp>

<Review>So my husband purchased 2 bungee jumps with bungee America for my birthday as a surprise. However things came up and we figured we would no longer be able to make it. So we called to cancel. We never got a response. We emailed and called many times. When our date came up we still was not able to make it. And we where never reimbursed or responded to. If you plan a trip with them make sure nothing comes up or you will not get your money back.< /Review>< response>

This was a terrifying experience that I NEVER would have been able to do without the help, support and encouragement from Bungee America. Not only do they do their jobs impeccably, all day long, but they do this magical thing where they see your fear, look deep in your eyes, and make you believe that you can face it. I never would have jumped from the bridge if not for the guys from Bungee cheering me on and reminding me that I could. If you're looking for a once in a lifetime opportunity, this is the company to do it with. I trust them with my life (literally). Plus they're all hot which is cool.</Text>

< review>
I ordered fresh bread and they gave me loaves off day old, frozen bread. I contacted Customer Service and they said since this is an independently owned location they can't control how they do business and they could not contact the owner or resolve the issue. Even the customer service representative thought it was odd. I was over charged $1.50 for each loaf and the issue was never resolved.</review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><user_id>110471230872209489889</user_id><review>Good location. If I was still a childless adult, this would be a 5 star rating. As that is no longer the case, it is now 4 star, here's why. We have a six month old baby. The tables can fit 6 people, however, the depth between seat back and table are very narrow even without holding a somewhat squirmy child. Also the metal pole under the table bruised the knees of both my husband and father in law entering the seating area, both are about 5'11". There are 2 alternate seating areas as options (two round tables in the back, or what looks like a wheelchair accessible bar at the front, both with moveable chairs.
We've come to this location 3 times now, good experience each time. Open promptly. Friendly, knowledgeable staff that could help us decipher between the best Italian options. Great customer service which goes a long way with us. Good salt n vinegar chips. Restroom is clean and stocked. Downside is there is no  baby changing station. There is a wheelchair ramp for the sidewalk in front of the store, with rail. Two wheelchair accessible spots directly in front, and multiple others.<//review><rate>4< /rate>< GmapID>

Requires you to download an app to your phone,  outside and order your food that way. Too complicated. Drove down to the Corona location where you can order inside with a mask on and take it to go.< /Review>

Called 20 minutes early for pick. Girl tells me they will keep a lookout for my car . Waited for more than 15 minutes and was ignored. Last time I come to buy at this store.</review>

Good food made quick, I don't agree with not having salt and pepper on the line to be added to the sandwich. When I asked for salt and pepper they gave me packets.</review>

<date>1438357197252</date><rate>2<//rate><text>First, the music is way too loud and a complete distraction for an eating experience.  Hearing AC/DC wailing away at "Back in Black" is not conducive to a decent dining experience.  Turn the music OFF.

Second, I don't want to see the "potty humor" all over your bathroom depicting various scenes of urination and defecation.  Completely unnecessary, stupid and, again, not conducive to any sort of dining experience.

Third, I don't want to hear your staff whining (to me and other staff) that an employee left and that they're swamped. Yes, the restaurant was busy, but only because it was the dinner hour.

Fourth, I know you are too busy to answer the phone, but does your phone have to be so loud that it's heard over the entire restaurant?  AC/DC interrupted by a loud, constantly ringing phone that apparently doesn't have message or mute capability.  Sheesh.  I changed my "for here" order to "to go" because I couldn't stand the blaring noise in the restaurant.  You're going to make your employees and customers deaf!

The sandwich was okay, but skimpy.

I actually went here for the 1st time because I SUPPORT legal hunting, but I won't be coming back again.  I'll be hunting for a different sandwich shop.< /text>< pictures>

No sub should come with mayo unless asked for!! Learn from Jersey Mike’s they have the perfect sub line and everything goes smooth get on that level of customer service and get some better bread choices I’ll come back in 6 months and give a better review if things change overall never going here again<//Review>

Poor quality bread, tomatoes were over ripened, very bland sandwich only put the slightest of drizzle of oil & vinegar on italian original sub. Delivery fee is based per item so the more you order the more they charge to bring it to you. I gave them a try and it was a huge disappointment much prefer Jersey Mike's or even Subway.< /review>

I have been washing here since its  opened due to free drying and it had always been very dirty and rude workers.  However  I'm very impressed at how clean the laundry matt has been lately. The new employee has drastically made a difference

<Review>If I could give zero stars i would , dryer ripped and stained all my clothes. I asked if dryer was working properly since it later was making noise told me yes , when i got home and fold my clothes since the pandemic i dont fold my clothes in the laundry and realize it was ripped with holes and gray stains . Called customer service didnt recieve a call back from manager , dont come here plus when you wash the clothes it stays with a smell since they dont clean their machines , keep out of here</Review>< pics>

This is a good place to wash and dry clothes but it's ALWAYS packed. Maybe a few more big washing machines and dryers should have been put in . Starting to look a little untidy.< /review>

Carsten is the best!  We had such an incredible food journey sitting at the bar and the drinks were fantastic. You can tell that everyone who works here is passionate about their food.
Highlights backwards: the desert wine from Napa, the dry sparkling wine, the cheese plate, the bread pudding (omg), the ramen, and the duck soup. Will be here again for sure!!</text>

Christy Hill has outdoor dining reopened. Nothing better than watching the sunset over the lake and mountains with good food and drinks. The heaters are good but bring a blanket.< /text>

We spend a birthday Dinner here, in the height of the beautiful Fall in Tahoe. Sitting above the lake with a magnificent view and a table with tons of privacy and a cozy space heater was truly memorable. Staff is super friendly and very knowledgeable. The Menu we ordered was delicious and just the right amount. Overall I cant wait to come back to this place.<//Review>

<Review>Christy Hill is an excellent restaurant that I recommend to the highest degree in Lake Tahoe. I usually like to try many restaurants in any city I frequent until find the best one and stick with it. Ladies and gents, here it is!

Never mind the amazing view, the service and food is amazing too. It's rare I find a restaurant when the ingredients and dishes stand out so much. I suggest the lamb chop and veggie pappardelle.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWt-gYipDod5hhkFvVKdCwdbxO4XWB87oYtLvH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1SUXy117oaUldCuodoTB9lud6ZPzm-2s-lwOJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO47t50vsUrMxiw9JPIGGHMv7p3bRxeDA9HurjV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

<text>Terrible I would not recommend this place. This is not the first time that I have had troubles with this restaurant but I decided to give them another shot. The hostess and staff are rude and condescending. We made a reservation over 3 weeks ago and when we arrived today they offered to seat us in a makeshift sand patio with crooked tables that is not leveled. I would be surprised if it is even legal...We explained to them that we were not wearing shoes appropriate for the sand and they did not give us an acceptable solution. We were the second party that arrived on the restaurant when they opened at 5pm and they "didn't have a table on the main restaurant deck". This is supposed to be fine dinning but it is certainly NOT. If they are going to offer such lousy unconventional seating "because of COVID" they should make their customers aware of it prior to arrival. That way the customer can dress appropriately. My prior experience was similar rude staff. The food is ok but definitely  not worth the hassle. There is much better on the lake like Wolfdales and Lone Eagle Grill. Again would NOT recommend this place at all.<//text><Rate>1< /Rate><user_id>100021053283755569681<//user_id></record>

We ordered take out so I can't speak for the in-service. But, the restaurant is very nice inside with beautiful views of the lake and a nice ambiance. The food was delicious. I ordered the gnocchi and was a little nervous about the poached egg on top. But the dish was amazing! The charcuterie plate offered lots of different textures and flavors. I've never had pickled fern before! My husband thoroughly enjoyed the short rib ravioli. Everything had excellent flavor, was cooked to perfection, and the portion sizes were decent. We will be back.</Text></record>

We spotted this place from the beach and had to come up to take a look. Although we only had a drink and dessert I fell in love with this place. The views are spectacular at sunset, so it's amazing for photos. They also have patio heaters outside so it's nice and warm too. The staff were super friendly too, and chatted to us about our holiday.</Text>

<Text>With good weather, there isn't a better place to eat in the world than the deck of Christy Hill. Cosy and casual, yet with a spectacular view. The food and service is excellent as well. I had the chicken which was beautifully presented and flavored perfectly. We've been coming to Christy Hill for years and will continue to do so for years to come.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCnZ7-qrjKMw9U6lqO4ygMYy0Carya1DS5GQTM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2Bib6gKGFgxcSz4rtsam7PutSLmhPuHXs2kas=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsczBXg-qLhbZH_GtC7WNd2oqHN6jX44pxygkI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80997d75ae9c3b7f:0xc771b005985f0e97<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The restaurant has a good view of the lake (specially during summer - during the winter the show covers it) and a cozy and romantic atmosphere. The food is posh, beautiful and ellaborated, but also expensive and not as delicious as I expected. The desserts, however, are really good. Try the cheesecake with lime. It's delicious!<//Review>

< Review>
It’s one of the most beautiful lakefront patio dining in north of Lake Tahoe. Reservation is highly recommended. Come dine early so that you can enjoy the sunset. The food is a bit bland, considering the price... I was a bit disappointed.
Although, the desert menu was great. The mocha shot was really excellent. Turmeric crème brûlée was delicious. I would come back for the view but not the food.</Review>

Christy Hill remains, in my humble opinion, one of the best places to get dinner in Tahoe City. We stopped there for dinner last Thursday, the 15th, after attending the 42nd annual Elegant Affair. We were seated almost immediately, and our server JB did an astounding job taking care of us. The food was amazing, and we treated ourselves to the best Fois Gras we've ever had in our lives.

Great atmosphere, great service, absolutely amazing food. That about sums up Christy Hill!<//Text>

<Text>View was amazing, food was just ok, wait staff had significant room to improve. The waiter spilled on me and didn’t apologize. Generally the atmosphere felt tired and there was no available bathroom. How is that possible when you charge $50 for an entree?<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80997d75ae9c3b7f:0xc771b005985f0e97< /gmapID></record>

Wonderful service, great food, and beautiful views. My only wish is that they had some draft beer, but considering that it’s an upscale wine-centric spot, I can understand.< /Text>

The food is delicious and the view is amazing truly a nice place to eat.  We were a group of 6.  So why the 3 stars?  The staff are a bit rude.  They need to have a group meeting on being more pleasant.<//Text>

We were turned away because we were not dressed fancy enough and/or other discriminating reasons. Both parties before and after us got seated without reservations. Can only second the other reviews who mention bad and condescending service.< /review>

<review>The views are gorgeous but, unfortunately, the food does not match. I ordered the lamb and my wife had gnocchi. The lamb had so much seasoning that I couldn't taste the flavor of the meat. The seasoning should compliment the flavor of the lamb, not overpower it. My wife enjoyed the gnocchi. The portion size for both dishes were small, but the prices are not.</review><gmap_id>0x80997d75ae9c3b7f:0xc771b005985f0e97<//gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>
<text>Extremely disappointed. My husband made a reservation on the deck with a lake view for my Birthday. Upon arriving to the restaurant the hostess brought us to the deck to a tiny bar table by the stairs. There were two rows of normal size tables between us and the lake view. Most of the tables were empty, even some in the first line since it was a relatively quiet Wednesday night. When I asked why do we have to sit so far after making a reservation and specifically asking for the lake view in a normal dining area, she told me the first line tables are only for those who have Birthdays! After telling her it was actually my Birthday today, she said NO. Apparently my husband did not mention it in the reservation (who would think reserving online and then calling in later to double check that we would get a nice table with a lake view would not be enough). Then she proceed seating other people and ignoring us. Without any explanation, we just got a cold No and a lot of embarrassment. If this restaurant markets itself as a fine dining, please hire adequate stuff with some decency and people skills.</text><user_name>Olena P</user_name>< Resp>

Five star location and view! Three star food and service. One star prices. Love the amazing view and the ambiance is lovely but the prices are way too expensive for the unexciting food.< /Review>

My friend and I chose this for our fancy birthday dinner celebration. She had the scallops and I had the mushroom ragout and we both thought our meals were outstanding! The server helped us choose a great bottle of wine to complement our meals. And the cheese plate was a great addition. Don't forget to get dessert- the creme brulee was perfect.< /text>

Beautiful view of the lake - there isn't a seat in the restaurant without. Food was only okay, and quite pricey. Goat cheese had clearly been plated (for days?) and refrigerated - it came out still cold. Pork osso buco was delicious. Sticky toffee cake was too sweet and dry. Happy hour is only at the bar.</Review>

Food was delicious and what a lovely panoramic view to the shoreline of Lake Tahoe. I really enjoyed  their Bison Carpaccio from their chef’s selection.<//review>

Beautiful location tucked near the lake, with a beautiful atmosphere. It's cozy and has outdoor seating available if you prefer! The staff is friendly and kind. I think they change their menu periodically, but we had the duck and lamb - delicious! Prices are obviously a bit higher than the average restaurant, but you're paying for the flavor and atmosphere, highly recommended! :) Let me tell you the desert we got was some sort of croissant bread pudding AND IT WAS FANTASTIC. Enjoy!< /Review>< pics>

Very disappointed in all senses.   Especially with a rude waitress who was clearly discriminating against me and my family.  I do not recommend you taking any person of your family  who has any type of  special need.  This restaurant is not prepared and not trained to serve  in a compassionate and unbiased way.  One day someone will file a law suit against them.    Cold, heartless, inhumane and cruel treatment for those with special needs.< /text>

Waiter recommended the lamb loin and halibut, both of which were delicious.  Wife said the halibut was perfectly seared, lamb was delicious.  We also had the gnocchi which was also perfect.  Great experience out on the deck and our waiter Jason did a great job.  Fantastic place, definitely recommend but avoid the cheese “cake.”< /Review>< user>

And the food was INCREDIBLE. I had a steak with veggies and he had a chicken dish. We also shared a Caesar salad which was the best salad I have ever had in my life. To finish off for dessert we shared vanilla bean ice cream with an espresso truffle. By far an amazing eating experience. It is pricey but totally worth it. Reserve in advance to get a good table in the patio. The views are breathtaking!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Everyone from the hostess, the bar tender, the Waiter to support staff did great job. The menu was a delight just to read through, with many choices. The food was done perfectly as ordered. The wine list had a great offering from domestic to imported select wines. My wife and I really enjoyed the table that had great view of the lake. I would recommend Christy Hill any one staying or just passing through Tahoe City.

We held a wedding rehearsal dinner at Christy Hill's Sandbar during July 2016. The owners and all of the staff were exceptional.  They took away my stress of organizing the rehearsal dinner for a destination wedding. They took care of many of the details like making sure that the flowers arrangement were fresh, appropriate and reasonably priced.  The suggested wine pairings were perfect. Said simply the food and service was excellent the location on the lake priceless.  The party guests all said that they enjoyed the event.</text>

We just went there for dinner (1/4/16).  The service was fantastic.  The food was just as amazing.  They had a special of shaved black truffles added to any dish we wanted for $15.  We went for it.  The truffles as it turns out were dried and tasteless.  They gladly removed the charge from our bill.  If we weren't so full from the appetizer and meal we had, we would have ordered dessert.  I definitely recommend this place if you want a delicious dinner.<//review>

After several great dinners here last winter, I'm glad to report that the food, wine, ambiance, and service are all fantastic this winter.   Our friends who have introduced us to many great restaurants in SF were impressed.  There is no doubt I'll be back multiple times this winter.

Note that the menu is seasonal.  For Winter 2012, the Scallop small plate, Kale side dish, every salad, and Squash/Kale ravioli all were all notably delicious.  I've also been consistently impressed with the white wines (~$7-10 a glass) through several menu changes.<//Text>

Placed a reservation on OpenTable and stated an outdoor seating request and that it was my mother's 60th birthday in the box. Now, let me just say that, after working at a restaurant for many years I understand that it was just a request. We were whisked right away to our outdoor table, loved the view and ordered our wine and starters when the owner came over and said that they had accomodated my written request but that I did not DO it correctly. I apparently didn't check a box for outdoor when making my reservation...? She then stated that we needed to be done by the next scheduled table turn or move!!! Absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. I would have been fired for telling guests that at the fine dining establishment I had worked in.

Will not be back. It is sad that for the past few years my mom would look up at the patio on our trips to Tahoe City and say, "I'd love to eat there someday." And when I finally made it happen for her 60th we were treated this way.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

We had enjoyed dinner then the Manager/owner asked us to change tables during our dessert time telling us we were staying too long at the table and it was booked for the next customers. We politely told her that we were not going to change tables. She grabbed my wife's arm and told us to leave. I politely told her if they had booked the table ahead of us and were running late then they should have moved the services to our table at a quicker pace. She then told me to leave and I did. We have been to gourmet restaurants for 30 years and never been asked to change tables during dinner. Not coming back.

Our service was so bad it was literally awkward to eat here. Decent food, terrible service, over priced and would never last in a larger town. Spend your money somewhere else.< /Text>

This is a fun and upscale restaurant for a special occasion or just a drink or dessert. Looking forward to enjoying their Lakeview deck once the snow melts.</review>

Ever had your wedding cake redecorated in front of your eyes by an entitled stranger?! Thanks to a Christy Hill employee, we have!

On August 14th we took our intimate wedding party to Christy Hill for dinner after our ceremony where an older woman who seemed to be associated with the host stand or (god-forbid) management helped bring out our cake. Apparently not satisfied with the fun, self-decorating job we did along with our friends (we had a very free, easy, goofy wedding), she proceeded to pick leaves off of a nearby bush and add them to the layers of our cake. Next thing I noticed, she had procured some flowers from somewhere and started adding them, too. At this point I had to tell her that we were happy with the decoration job that was done - that's why we had done it - and that she could stop now. You could see the woman struggling to comprehend why we wouldn't want her to put the rest of the flowers and leaves in her hands on the cake. I gave her another "It's fine, you can stop" or something of the sort, and she she finally stepped away.

I cannot imagine a a world in which  someone would ever think it okay to redecorate someone else's wedding cake without their permission, but that's apparently the world this lady lives in, and she works at Christy Hill.

Also, even with the confirmation call they gave us that day, the one that I had placed a week prior, and the original call to make the reservation months before, they still got it wrong. We were a party of ten total and had asked for a table for eight for the wedding party and a nearby table for two for the photographer and videographer. When we arrived they had set the main table for ten, with a small table for two nearby, a total of twelve seats. Almost immediately we were asked if we didn't need the small table so they could give it to someone else since we could fit at the main table. Of course, we weren't going to say that our videographer and photographer needed to sit at the other table while the extra two spots at the main table sat empty; that seemed quite rude and awkward. There was an extra two-top table added to the main one that easily could have been left out, so I'm not sure if this was a tactic to get that other table back or what. Thankfully, our videographer and photographer were amazing additions to our day so it wasn't weird to have them dine with us!

I cannot deny, though, that the food was delicious. Our waiter was kind, the water and wine continuously refilled, and the bill ended up being less than expected! I still recommend going, maybe just don't choose this location for an event.< /Text>

We had reserved a table, and got placed next to the exit with limited view.

Folks who came at the same time as us, WITHOUT a reservation, got the table with the view.

When questioned if we too could get a table with better view, the hostess told us no, and that "you know people reserve tables in May for this place!" 😂

Needless to say that me and the hubby decided to leave, thinking that these guys do not need our +$150 charity for this joint - and moved to another resto!</Text>

This restaurant is excellence and opulence beyond anything that can be comprehended, everything from the stunning eastward view of the lake, to the Seasonal Sorbet, everything was amazing. It is no wonder why this restaurant consistently ranks high among other restaurants in this caliber.  I was very pleased with the service provided, as despite not being dressed for the occasion or having a reservation, the front desk was pleasant and accommodating.

The food:

As a whole, the price point was reasonable for the service, view, and quality of food received, if you are making a decision simply based on this alone.

I ordered the Heirloom Tomato & Watermelon salad,  Deviled Green Eggs and Ham, the House Soup, the Pan Roasted Gnocchi, and finally the Fresh Tagliatelle Pasta.

The Heirloom Tomato & Watermelon salad was excellent, it is an excellent starter to share with a party of four. The colors really pop in this dish, and the taste of the tomatoes were well pronounced in this specific dish, as this salad brings together aspects of the sunflower and the tomato without it feeling forced. The sunflower seeds offered a nice aftertaste and fresh crunch to rely on, and the cilantro ver jus brought together the tomato and the sunflower elements in a harmonious alliance. It was not too acidic to overwhelm the flavors of the tomato, rather it complimented the freshly prepared tomato. To top the entire flavor profile, the Fromage Blanc was simply enthralling, not too pronounced to be the leading taste profile in the composition, but it had a unique presence that further brings all elements of the salad together.

In general, I am not usually a fan of deviled eggs, but the idea of this dish thought up by Dr. Seuss was too much to resist. First of all, the duck meat was sublime. The tiny strip of duck meat was just enough to give the appetizer the kick it needed, and I think it really compliments the entire dish very well. The taste of the duck and the watercress yolk mixture was out of this world. A point that perhaps was not to my liking was how undercooked the hard boiled egg, but perhaps that lends to how rich and creamy the watercress yolk was.

I honestly do not remember what the house soup was, but I do remember it was served intentionally cold, and that it was pretty good. It was a chicken stock based, and it was very smooth.

The Pan Roasted Gnocchi was really something else. First of all, the gnocchi was well cooked and the char on the outside allowed it to resist the moisture of the pan sauce, as the inside of the gnocchi was immersed enough with the sauce but the gnocchi held its shape well. The inside of the gnocchi was just barely permeated by the pan sauce, and the  poached egg also helped add dimension to the dish. The dish was very balanced with the proper ratio of vegetables and that allowed for an melodious dish. Again the duck meat in this dish was amazing. The meat was very tender as it barely clung to the fork as I went for the gnocchi. It was a pleasant surprise to see such a seemingly unconventional dish come together so nicely.

Despite the Fresh Tagliatelle Pasta being the most inexpensive of the pastas offered, it did not take away at all from the fact that this was the most memorable part of the dinner for me. I can still remember the texture of the pasta, the aroma of the mushroom ragout, and the lingering taste that the pine nuts in this harmonious amalgamation of all these locally sourced ingredients tossed with truffle oil. The large cuts of parmesan, peas, and the poached egg all everything that makes pasta unforgettable.  If anything on the menu was a must have, it would be this.

Everything on this menu goes above and beyond, and pushes the boundaries of fine cuisine in California. The creativity, innovation, and presentation is ethereal.</Text>

We returned to our favorite Tahoe City restaurant and were pleased again.  This is an exceptional restaurant in a beautiful lake side setting.  We ate a number of appetizers and small plates.   Initially, we started with salt roasted marble (colored round) potatoes served with an aioli.  If you like roasted potatoes, you will love these. Next, we shared deviled eggs with small slices of prosciutto garnish.  The charcuterie plate was superb.  Three cold pates, goose, chicken and a country style, with multiple mustards, pickled green strawberries, with Apple slices, dates and prosciutto garnishes. Finally, the seared fois gras was perfect as always.  The main dishes are varied, each with unique and interesting ingredients.  You will have a wonderful experience.  Enjoy the view from the deck or the main restaurant above.< /text>

<Review>I had a reservation at this place while on vacation and it took an hour to get seated for a party of 9.  This is a small place so don't plan anything here that seats more than 4 as they clearly cannot handle it.  The manager gave a couple of free drinks to my party but most of us don't drink so that was not sufficient to make up for reservation indiscretion.   He also didn't seem to really care either from the way he acted.  I would not go here if I were you unless you are willing to overpay for at best mediocre service.  The food was decent but the portions were small.  The service at Lake Tahoe restaurants in general is poor so this place is par for the course so no shock on this front.  I wouldn't bother going here again unless you want to drink wine and look out the window.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Purchased an 11' Achilles RIB & 20 Hp Tohatsu From Boat Specialists,
Kevin Schank, was the sales person, A real Gentleman, professional and knowledgeable. Kevin took my deposit and arranged for pick up.
I showed up early for pickup and my order was ready, Kevin was very thorough going over the RIB and engine. A very smooth transaction.
I highly Recommend Boat Specialists ........< /Review>< Pictures>

100 percent great people! They care about their work and are professionals. We Spent months waiting for a motor and countless hours working on this project. They came through 100 percent. They are honest and more then fair. If they have a competitor, I would call you liar. I don’t know them personally, but they treated me as if they did.

If your debating between these guys vs anyone else, call them and trust my review.  Boat guys who care about all boats and doing their jobs right!

Thank you

Dave!!!</review>

<text>The owner of this business, Jarred Potts, is an extremely high quality individual who goes out of his way to assist people in ways not often seen these days.  I have known and done business with Jarred for twenty years and knew his father while he was running the business.  Dad would be proud with what Jarred has done.  From the little storefront in the harbor to the enormous business  Inflatable has become- it is an amazing transformation.  My thanks to Jarred and all the employees for all the help with my boating needs over the years.  This business is the best run machine I have ever seen.  Simply amazing.

I could not be happier with the purchase of my new Mercury 9.9 horsepower outboard motor from Boat Specialist. "Dave" was very professional and considerate while answereing all my questions concerning my purchase. For customer service second to none, don't hesitate to call or visit Dave at  Boat Specialist in Ventura California, even if you live in Kansas like me!

We are so happy with our boat from these guys! They made the experience so easy and cool.  Kevin in sales walked us through the ordering process and was more than patient with our many phone calls and questions.  And once the boat arrived, Josh and his crew (Zack 👌🏼) took over and went above and beyond as we figured things out.  Thanks for everything!< /review>

Fantastic service and sales process. I purchased a boat from them over the Internet. The sales specialist, Kevin, was very helpful in terms of getting the boat outfitted to my needs and was very skilled with his recommendations. When I came to look at the boat, it was exactly as billed. He worked with my difficult timeline and challenging delivery, exceeded my Expectations on all fronts. I would definitely use them again I would recommend you consider doing the same.< /text>

You can't get better service than what these people deliver because it doesn't exist. I bought an inflatable during a big sales event. Great price, shipping included, no sales tax since I am not a California resident. I was told they sold hundreds of boats during the sale and I bought mine on the very last day at the very last hour,  meaning I was at the back of the line when it came time to ship it out. I had spoken with them a few times while I was doing my research and they were always very helpful and answered all my questions thoroughly. I was leaving on a two month cruise very soon after the purchase and needed the boat ASAP. They asked me when I was going and not only did they go out of their way to make it happen but they exceeded any reasonable expectations. They still had to order the boat from the manufacturer but told me they would keep an eye out and send it as soon as it arrived in their store. They even promised to overnight it "on their dime if they had to" in order to get it to me for my cruise though it ended up they were able to ship it UPS. They kept me posted the entire way and it arrived at my Virginia home from California with four days to spare. Then to top it off they overnighted the Certificate of Origin at no additional cost to me so I could get it registered before I left. These guys are awesome. Their prices are great and I can attest to the service after the sale. Thank you Inflatable Boat Specialists!!< /Text>

Dingy/rib purchase. Cheaper than a lot of people. Even with shipping cost. Came quickly and in good condition. Only problem is their website said awaiting shipping after it was processed, and 3 days later it arrives out of nowhere. 1 hour after it was delivered we get an emails stating it was shipped.... please fix your shipping and tracking portion of deliveries. I was lucky to be in when it arrived. I’d have fathered liked to plan the delivery out.<//Review>

However, our system was not as quick, and the emails did not generate until the next day, which caused you to receive the notification after the item was delivered.

I had a better online shopping experience than I thought possible for buying an outboard motor. The price I got was as good as any I found online and better than any I found in my region. The shipping was free, fast, and more importantly easy. It's almost a shame I don't need another outboard or inflatable, because the whole process was a pleasure. Thanks Guys!< /Review>

<text>Kevin was awesome to work with. I looked at a bunch of info online before my purchase as it would be the second Zodiac that I have owned. I live in Michigan so I wasn't sure how it was going to go with ordering something from California but it went really well. I was very satisfied with the customs service I received on the phone and when ordering my boat. My boat came within 3 days which I thought was very good and when I had a couple questions after the sale Kevin and Dustin took good care of me. I would recommend Inflatable Boat Specialists and would purchase more product from them in the future.

I purchased one of their boats from a private individual and the boat was 9 years old with very little use, but the seller didn’t have some of the paper work necessary for me to get it registered. I called this company to see if there was anything they could do for me. A Deanna Carmichael helped with problem and several weeks later I was able to register the boat. She was so helpful, great attitude with  the best professionalism you could ask. You rarely ever find a company anymore that would even deal with you with an old boat. Definitely 10 stars for the company and Deanna. Thanks so very very much.  Marc S.< /review>< Resp>

Dustin - best sales manager I’ve  ever dealt with.  Very quick at responding to my questions and concerns.  I am from Austin, Texas. I was very hesitant to buy a zodiac boat from out of state.  I thought it would be difficult to deal with shipment, MSO and signed invoice . Paper works that are required to register boat in Texas.   Dustin explained the process,  took the payment , then continue to follow up with me to make sure boat arrived a long with the paper work.   Excellent service.

<rate>5< /rate><Name>Colin Davis</Name><Resp>None< /Resp><Date>1531567024155< /Date><Review>Inflatable Boat Specialists stands behind the products they sell and they don't give up until their customers are satisfied and mated with a boat that is right for them.  I was dissatisfied with a  certain model I had purchased for the purposes I needed it for in my charter business and we were having trouble getting that manufacturer's representative to help.  IBS made it right on their own and swapped me out boats, so I could safely continue my fishing charters, and to satisfy me as a customer.  My contact Brently Dunivant is an asset to IBS, and to every single other employee at IBS, I greatly appreciate your integrity and willingness to go the extra mile to put customers first.  The prices are great, and the selection is too.  I highly recommend these guys for your inflatable boat purchases!

<text>It's been 6 business days today, and the outboard motor we got still has 0 updates. I don't know if it shipped yet, or not? The site says 2 to 4 days shipping. I can understand covid-19 is slowing things down a bit but when it does ship it will be another ???? Week? Before it gets to us in TN. Fingers crossed maybe it will ship today.

Update-Tried to purchase a 6hp tohatsu this week from here. Got the run around so I just ended up buying it from a local dealer. I think they might still be upset about my first 1 star review not sure but I was told they don't have it in stock. But their website says they do so who knows.</text>< pics>

Exceptional experience despite shipping issues out of their control.

IBS has been an amazing team to work with. UPS damaged the boat in transit and they helped me exchange it quickly all during the shutdown due to Covid19. I am grateful I purchased from a team like this rather than trying to save a dollar on a mass retail site where I may have been stuck with a damaged boat.

Great selection and great prices.

Thank you Jen and team! I will be buying from all of you again.< /review>

We recently got our boat from Inflatable Boat Specialists and Jen coordinated everything seamlessly.  From helping us in purchasing the right trailer, motor, and cover, to managing the registration of both the boat and the trailer, and even arranging to have the boat delivered right to our house, the whole process was smooth and we are so pumped to get in the water.  Competitive pricing and friendly staff made the experience super easy and 10/10 would recommend using IBS!< /Text>

<Review>For a first time customer, I was very pleased with my experience here.  I went in to the shop in search of a small outboard for my dinghy.  The staff was super helpful in talking about all of my options with me.  I ended up buying one from Casey that day, and they had it ready for me within about an hour and a half, tuned up and ready to go.  So far so good!< /Review>< Pictures>

Great doing business with people who show they value the customer.  Found them on the internet, made email contact, talked on phone once, bought the boat, received the boat as promised. Along the way the salesman (Dustin) checked in to confirm shipping was underway and he followed up several times to be sure all was good with the purchase. Highly recommend these guys because of their very fair price and wonderful customer service.< /Review>

<review>I had a friend who purchased a boat here and told me all good things. I have an older boat and they are doing a lot of work to it. I was surprised how much these guys can do as far as service. Pretty much anything you want done they can handle. They got me hooked up with a new Pacific Trailer. They additionally ran tests on my outboard, are doing some fabrication, and a good amount of electrical. They are also getting me hoist straps for my skiff. I've been working with Jared and Dustin and both have been friendly, responsive and knowledgeable. These guys run a tight ship and are really good at what they do! I will be returning for all my boating needs. I would highly recommend them to anyone! - Todd Hartman< /review>< pics>

I just purchased a 10’ inflatable with a 25hp Yamaha , and I am very happy with the product. I am in San Diego and was having trouble finding the boat I wanted, I was able to get a hold of Dustin and he helped me with every step. He also recommended a few small details that made all the difference in the world. They delivered the boat to me, and walked me through all the details. These guys are great, only place I’ll buy from in the future.< /review>

Outstanding support and service.  I had several questions regarding availability of Zodiac boats, proper motor sizing and post-sale warranty support all of which were quickly and fully addressed by the team at Inflatable Boat Specialists.  These guys know their boats and their service is top notch.  I received my boat and motor 4 days after I ordered them.  They were expertly packaged and arrived in perfect condition.  I had concerns with spending this kind of money online and across the country but the result was outstanding.  Their after order support is also unbeatable.  I'll be coming back to these guys for any of my future tender/inflatable needs.  Great customer service, great products, great prices.  Highly recommended.< /text>

<review>Highly recommend IBS, they re-powered my 20' Boston Whaler and I am very happy with the results. As expected some of the old rigging on my boat had to be replaced but Dustin always kept me informed about what needed to be done and the costs involved. I was also happy with the 2 week turnaround time especially since the job was done at the peak of the Summer boating season.<//review><Date>1542315168014< /Date><user_id>108925195043090376806< /user_id>< gmapID>

<review>Great place. I just bought a Zodiac PRO Classic 500 with a Yamaha 70hp outboard. Dustin was extremely helpful answering all my questions and making solid recommendations along the way.  The boat had to be ordered and I received it a day earlier than when promised. These guys went above and beyond to deliver a perfectly rigged and spotless boat.  The zodiac runs fantastic and is a joy to drive. I wouldn't buy from any other dealer. This is my third inflatable I have purchased from them.</review>< GmapID>

Friendly, knowledgeable and professional staff. Been doing business with this company for a few years now and don't have any regrets or complaints. Recently took my zodiac if for a service and some repair work. Inflatable Boat Specialists buffed it out so well and even put in some extra work free of charge. Highly impressed with this company.< /Text>

I was researching buying a new AB inflatable and am known for finding the best prices by my friends.  That best price was offered by Inflatable Boat Specialists when I met them at the Pacific Sail and Powerboat show. Not only did they offer a great price, they were very friendly and knowledgeable.  Dustin followed up with me after the sail and Josh delivered the boat the next week. Could not ask for better service. Highly Recommended!<//text>

<text>A few months ago I bought an Inmar Inflatable, outboard and trailer from Inflatable Specialists.  I worked with Dustin and everything went great.  My friend bought an outboard through him and he had a smooth hassle free experience so I went straight to him.  In a few communications, I had exactly what I wanted on order.  It was delivered on time and when we went to get it, he took his time with me.  Great squared away place and great service.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I purchased two scratch and dent Yamaha F70LA outboards from Kevin at Inflatable Boat Specialists during their 2018 annual sale.  Prices were excellent....several thousand dollars less than MSRP.  All of the employees made the purchase, installation, and follow up go seamlessly from Kevin in sales to Casey in Installations  and then Adam in parts and finally Matt in service.  My experience with Inflatable Boat Specialists was excellent and I can highly recommend them.<//Text>

<Text>I needed a new tender with very specific size needs to fit on my boat in Long Beach.  I shopped for a month before I found Inflatable Boat Specialists' website.  I am so happy I did!  I worked through the process with Dustin, the sales person.  Great and honest guy!  He helped me choose the boat, equipment and options to  meet my needs exactly and within my budget.  The new tender as delivered to me yesterday by their great technician, Connor.  It is perfect, as was my experience dealing with this company.   How refreshing to find honest, old fashioned customer care.  I would go no where else to buy any product they sell.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80e852c733d0906d:0xc197a37de8c055e7</gmapID></record>

<Name>A. Lembcke</Name><time>1489945320854</time><rating>5</rating><Review>I ordered an inflatable boat with outboard online from this company. I called ahead, because I needed some advice pertaining which engine to buy.  Advice was excellent and to the point. The order was shipped and delivered speedily. I received a checklist on what was done with the engine ( I picked the "engine incomissioning" by this company) and a phone number to arrange a call to get the checklist explained if needed. I called and we went through this list in detail. Impressive customer care. Everything was to my fullest satisfaction and I will definitely buy there again. I tried out my new boat and outboard and they operated flawlessly, as expected.<//Review>< Pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Below is my original review. Within a few days of posting my original review Deanna contacted me and was concerned about the level of service I received. She asked questions about who I dealt with and what the specifics were. She apologized and said she would work on the issue. As a business owner myself, I appreciated her taking her time to try and resolve the issues. Because of that I've changed my rating to four stars and I look forward to doing business with them again. I wish more business owners were concerned about the level of service they provide. Thank you Deanna.

Although I think this place is good at what they do in terms of knowing their business, the service at the parts counter has been spotty at best the last few times I've been there. It's almost as if I was interrupting their busy day. I was looking for a part for a Suzuki outboard and he quickly said we don't carry anything from Suzuki and sent me on my way. So I went back to my manual and found out that my outboard was manufactured by the people who they DO carry the parts for. Of course when I came back in and asked​ him to look a little bit more he had no interest in helping, simply asking if I had a part number for him. I I'd probably go someplace else if I had one that did what they do. I'm reminded of a plaque that used to hang in an auto parts store when I was a kid that said "Customers are not an interruption of your busy day, they ARE your busy day". I couldn't agree more.< /review><Time>1506472201827<//Time><Response>None</Response><userid>114149409429480316847</userid><Pics>None<//Pics><user_name>Rick Stull</user_name></record>

Not only do they offer great products at great prices, they also stand behind their products and make customer satisfaction a priority.  I am a broker who recommends all of my clients to IBS.  The owner, Jared, always gives me and my clients the utmost attention and respect.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a quality inflatable at a very fair price.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>I've been buying from Inflatable Boat Specialists for over 10 years. IBS is a class act with solid, honest personnel across all departments. Their knowledge of all inflatable and outboard motor issues is superb. They "get it" about service. They are friendly, courteous and always a pleasure to work with.</text>< Pics>

I had a great experience working with Jared to get the right trailer for my boat at a great price. When I came to pick everything up at the shop, Deanna was very helpful in taking care of my paperwork (no visit to the DMV is a plus) and I was up and running in no time. I would definitely work with the team at Inflatable Boat Specialists again and give any family or friend the same recommendation.</review>

Bought my Achilles 315 RIB w/20HP Honda from these guys (Dustin) in 2016, had serviced and recently flipped dinghy and needed to get major repairs and new motor. Just total pros at every turn. Specifically Matt in the service department and Dustin in Sales, VERY impressed with communication, responsiveness and all around service. And keep in mind that I dock in Marina Del Rey too so their weekly visits make it a no-brainer even though they are in Venture. WAY better than anything local to me!</text>

I have recently purchased an Achilles inflatable boat from Inflatable Boat Specialists, and  the boat was shipped to me the same day,  and arrived in perfect condition in just a few days on the East Coats!  I have contacted their sales team a few times via email, to make sure I receive everything on time,  and my emails where answered promptly in less than 1 hour, with all the info I needed. They have even scanned and email  me the manufacturer certificates so I can start the boat registration ahead of time. Everything went very smooth, thank you Casey for all your help!</review>

Really great service from these guys. They guided me to a top condition used package of dinghy and outboard, delivered to my location and even met me on a Sunday to upgrade the fuel tank at no cost. Clear communication and follow through. I haven't visited their shop yet, this was all online / in person at my location.<//review>

We received nothing but outstanding professional service from Dustin McCarthy at the Inflatable Boat Specialist in Ventura, CA. He went out of his way to help us and ensure that we were taken care of. We highly recommend them for any and all of your boating needs.

<text>Everything about this place screams QUALITY and PROFESSIONALISM!!
I just had my Parker 2320 re-powered with a brand new Yamaha 300. Jared helped me through the whole process, answered all of my questions and took care of all the paperwork then Matt took care of all my concerns related to the service/installation side of things.
Their service department is top notch, honest, up front and on time...if they say they are going to do something, they do it! If something isn’t working out as planned, they call you and give you all your options! All of their mechanics are knowledgeable and very helpful!!
I am so happy with them and their business, they have me as a customer FOR LIFE!!
If you are looking for a new place to take your boat, or looking for a new boat...look no further, these are your guys!!
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!!!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Casey at IBS was fantastic. He helped us purchase boat-then found IBS could offer us a cheaper price. That saved a bunch of money.
Next he called Zodiac-which turned out to have a factory/warehouse 20 minutes from my home (South Carolina), then called us-said we could pick up ourselves thus saving $150 shipping fee. All told we got a great dinghy at a great price.
It came very well packed-much protective cardboard and foam, easy to inflate and all the parts were there.</review><user>106895340339894740976< /user>< username>

I recently spent time dealing with IBS on the purchase of an AB inflatable, and they were a pleasure to work with throughout every stage. Dustin made this experience as painless and effortless as possible, always responsive to questions, making every effort to keep me updated, and did so from my first inquiry (answering countless "newbie" questions from me) to the final shipping arrangements, and everything in between. Jen was great to work with on the final details of registration and shipping. Sometimes you get lucky enough to find a business that does everything right (and does right by you), even though it is dealing with the customer from a distance the entire time  - that was my experience with IBS.< /review>

The prices are competitive and the quality of their products is great. The advice, for an inflatable rookie like me was, and will be, priceless. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable; Matt, Casey, Chris, and Adam are all great; sorry if I'm forgetting somebody. What blew me away is the quality of the service and workmanship. The mounting work they did on my boat and the quality of the repairs was amazing, and it was nice not to devaluate my boat through my own inexperienced attempts.

I highly recommend inflatable boat specialist. I was treated with respect and friendliness. I am from Napa and the drive to Ventura was worth it to buy my 2 outboards from them. Dustin is very helpful and made the purchase simple and pleasant.
I was unable to find this quality of service from my local dealers. and I would recommend them to anyone needing to buy outboards for their boat.They are truly awesome!< /Text>

Jen was awesome to work with. I called her with some questions and she had answers to everything I threw at her. I needed to have my RIB delivered on a specific date as that was the only time I was going to be on my boat and Jen made sure I got it that Monday. Got it un-boxed and launched and on the davits and could't be happier with my purchase. Thanks IBS and especially Jen!</text>

<Review>Was torn between the Zodiac Cadet and the Highfield KAM.  All dealers I contacted for a Highfield didn't seem too interested in selling small ones. Had a Highfield dealer tell me he had a 2016 200 KAM  discounted and then I find out he's going to charge me $275 for shipping. Kevin Schank at Inflatable Boat specialist was great, I bought a 2019 Zodiac Cadet 200 RU at sale price with free shipping and get a $150 rebate from Zodiac.

Best customer service I've ever experienced and the AB dinghy was better than expected at the best internet price!  We are in process of doing The Great Loop and ordered the boat while in Canada.  Josh Casey went above and beyond to get the boat delivered to Michigan so that we could enjoy it on the Loop.</Review>

<review>Recently repowered my Grady White with a new Yamaha 175. Dustin cut me a great deal and what I appreciated most was that he did not pressure me for any up-sales. Good honest work is hard to come by these days and that is what they do.  I received my boat back in less than a week, all cleaned up and ready to fish. I highly recommend Inflatable Boats Specialist for your repower needs.</review><user>103415227050558872980< /user><username>tim schneider<//username><Gmap_id>0x80e852c733d0906d:0xc197a37de8c055e7<//Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>Came in looking for a small inflatable dinghy/motor combo and Dustin was very helpful and patient in guiding me to the best option for my usage. Ended up with an Achilles LEX-77 and Torqeedo 1003 motor. The combo is exactly what I need for shore duty and exploring Santa Cruz Island. I highly recommend this place and especially working with Dustin.<//review><GmapID>0x80e852c733d0906d:0xc197a37de8c055e7< /GmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_id>

I just bought a Achilles SU 16' inflatable rib w/70 hp Yamaha 4 stroke from the boat specialist. Wow!! Super rig! This boat resides on the Colorado river/ Lake Powell in Utah (not a sea craft... yet). I must say the service and info from Casey Carmichael(salesman) is first rate. He took the time to go thru the boat/motor/trailer thoroughly.  Also, thanks to the crew that assembled it all. Follow up is timely, the website is friendly and the store is, well, a giant TOY store! I highly recommend these guys & company.  A satisfied customer, Richard.<//Review>

If you buy anything from their website, check and make sure that it's in stock. Most likely it won't be. I have placed order for outboard, and after all order goes through and my card is charged they contact me back and say the one I wanted is sold already and more expensive models are available for me to choose from. So I told them, I will get my refund until they receive new shipment. 3 weeks later, I make sure prior to making purchase that outboard is in stock and once again the card is charged and all paid for, sales rep contacts back and say the description was wrong that it has more damage to it then described and need to charge more to my card to make it as it is described. Why would they need to charge more to make it as it is described?

-Update -
So after couple days, sales rep contacted me back and told me that it was mistake on their part and the motor will be in state how it is described in their website and it will be ready for pick up as scheduled.
Eventually everything worked out and they showed their reputation and integrity is important to their business.<//review>

<review>Ok so I can honestly say that Inflatable Boat Specialists is one the of the best businesses I’ve dealt with in a long time!!!!
I live in Arizona and was buying off of my brothers advice, well I purchased the totally wrong boat.  So with not much hope of exchanging it I called Dustin and we were able to work out a VERY fair deal to trade it in and buy the boat I needed.
Knowing I was driving from Arizona and would be short on time, Dustin had everything in order and ready to go when I arrived.  I think the whole exchange took less than :30 minutes with several employees helping out to make sure I had tie downs secure and everything that I needed.
Truly a great company to do business with!!!!
I will not look anywhere else for my next boat purchase.

We were shopping for a new tender for our boat and were intrigued by The Inflatable Boat Specialists competitive pricing.  We live a few hours south of Ventura, but met Dustin, one of the sales representatives, at a boat show.

I was impressed by his knowledge and professionalism from the beginning of our relationship. We purchased the boat we had been looking for without driving to their showroom and saved thousands of dollars.

Dustin provided great service by checking in with me during the process to ensure everything went smoothly.  If you are looking for quality products, great service and want to save a ton of money, I recommend you give these guys a call.</text>< pictures>

I bought a  brand new boat with excelent customer service. My salesman Dustin McCarthy  answered all my questions.

Boat was send down to texas very carefully and arrived as on the show room.

Parts and service are always available via phone or email.

Definitively my investment was  done with the right  dealer.

Inflatable Boat Specialists has been my "go to" shop for all my dinghy and accessory needs for decades, starting back when they were located on Harbor Blvd. next to the entrance to Ventura Harbor.  They have prices that are competitive with online vendors, a knowledgable and friendly staff, and an excellent service department.  Why go anywhere else?< /Text>

I am a firm believer in rewarding that which you wish to continue. A low price with bad service is not a good deal. The guys over at IBS (Dustin in particular) have been great to deal with. All of my questions were addressed in a timely and professional manner. There was one hiccup during the entire process of purchasing, shipping, and receiving my new F150 and Dustin addressed it immediately. None of this passing the buck or excuse making that I so often run into these days. My motor is now mounted and ready for some fish stalking. I would definitely recommend these guy to anyone looking to re-power their boat.</text>

< Review>
IBS has a gem of a customer service rep, Kevin Schank.  He answered all my questions knowledgeably, recommended the right fit boat for my needs, assisted me when I had questions for the shipping company (made a 3 way conference call), was super enjoyable to talk with, was quick and efficient, worked within a short time frame, looked for the best price deal for me,  and sent documents immediately.  All in all, I am recommending IBS to all my contacts because of Kevin.  The boat is brand new and seems amazing, but I hope it is as great as Kevin was to deal with.< /Review>

I rented one of their RIB's when I was in town for a regatta at the Ventura YC.  Great service and the boat ran really well.  Will consider them for any future coach/spectator boat charter needs in the future when in the area.<//Review>

< Review>
I purchased my Achilles HB-315DX with a Tohatsu 20hp outboard at the Inflatable Boat Specialists annual tent sale. This is my second tender that
I have purchased at this show. Dustin McCarthy was my salesman and provided me with very timely and professional service. When my new dinghy was delivered to MDR it was found to have a serious defect due to an installation error of the console. Dustin immediately addressed the problem and Inflatable Boat Specialists promptly replaced the defective dinghy with a brand new one which in fact had extra feature which I was not charged for. The original error was unfortunate but most important was how readily they addressed and corrected the problem. This company has earned my loyalty.</Review>

< Review>
I ordered a Tohatsu outboard motor from Inflatable Boats online.  They called to verify my order was correct and promptly shipped the motor form California to Nebraska.  They provided a FedEx tracking number to follow shipment.  When the shipment arrived, the FedEx package was damaged and two plastic parts on the motor were broken.  Brently in Online Sales provided great service in getting the parts re-ordered and shipped to me at no charge.  In addition, Brently and Nick (Technician) both took multiple calls from me and provided guidance as I setup the motor and tested its operation.  I really appreciate their superb customer service.  It is rare to find a company online who work so hard to deliver what they promise and stand behind their products.   I would definitely recommend Inflatable Boat Specialists for your boating needs!<//Review>

My wife Christina and I film the TV show Flip or Flop on HGTV.  As you can imagine we are very busy and time is valuable. Jared Potts from the Inflatable boat specialist went above and beyond.  He made the transaction smooth and went over every detail for the SMALL boat for the BIG boat lol.  We love our Dingy and the name Flip or Flop 2!!!!  Tarek and Christina< /review>

<text>We dealt with Brently, Frankie and Casey and all three of them couldn't have been nicer - patient, courteous and very helpful throughout the whole process

We were shopping for a new dinghy to replace our 25 year old Novurania RIB which finally died.  When we first came to the store Brently helped us look at used trade-ins and they had a number to choose from.  We chose a one year old Achilles with an aluminum floor, inflatable keel and bimini.  While this was not a RIB, we thought we would be OK with the aluminum floor and arranged to pick it up 3 days later with our trailer.

Before we picked it up we changed our mind and decided we wanted another RIB and we decided it would be new.  No problem to switch our deposit to a new one.  Frankie was particularly helpful explaining the pros/cons of Achilles vs Zodiac vs AB Inflatables.  He was also very patient going over the various models of each manufacturer in the size we were considering.  Once we settled on the Achilles 315DX, he quoted us a very fair price.  I compared his prices with a number of Achilles dealers between San Diego, LA and the Bay Area and he was $25 below the lowest quote I received on the phone.  Frankie was also helpful with the DMV paperwork and getting just the right color for the CF numbers keeping me informed along the way.

When we picked it about a week later Casey was a gem as our trailer rollers had to be adjusted for the shape of the Achilles hull.  He arranged for one of the mechanics to make the adjustments while we waited.  He also patiently explained all the major components and features.

Overall, one of the most pleasant purchasing experiences my wife and I have had!<//text><date>1493752430684</date>< Name>

Terrible Company as of late. Ordered 1600.00 of equipment on May 28th, Order was never delivered on June 3rd as told it would. FedEx has yet to receive a package to deliver to me, as show on the tracking information, they only received a Label creation request from DJI. DJI refuses to cancel my order stating it is in ship mode (as it has been for 17 days. DJI is refusing to refund me my money. What a nightmare!  Don't get involved with them.... They have recently laid off most of their US operations employees, which I am sure that their financial woes probably has something to do with this.< /Text>

<text>Worse company and zero customer service . I would fire everyone one that works in the customer service department.  Not worth buying anything from these guys!  I bought a new drone that didn’t work and it took 6 months to replace a complete drone and I get half one back.  No controller. No battery, no nothing. TAKE CARE OF YOUR CUSTOMERS<//text>< pictures>

CARE REFRESH IS A LIE - Don't buy DJI, per chinese law all their data goes right to the Chinese government/military.  And they don't honor their agreements - I used to be a customer, but after a flyaway (with DJI care refresh coverage!) they didn't do anything.  Am suing DJI for the cost of my drone.  go Skydio.  Better drone, US made, not feeding the enemy data.< /Text>

<review>While I acknowledge there are countless numbers of negative reviews about DJI's Customer Service, I can only speak of my own personal experience with an unbiased and honest review. As you'll see in my screenshot, it took exactly 7 days from the time I a) crashed my brand new Phantom 4 Pro, b) filed an online request for repair and c) paid my $99 DJI Care Refresh Express payment until the time my replacement P4P was being shipped back to me. That alone is perfect. The standard UPS Ground amounted for the entire replacement time with transit to DJI from Florida taking exactly 7 days (Mon-Mon). Upon my contacting of DJI via their North America toll-free number, I spoke to several people (all of whom spoke clear/casual English) over the course of several different calls (all of which turned out to be wholly unnecessary), DJI has came through for me like a lighthouse in the dark by shipping my P4P back to me 2nd day air via UPS! From the gut wrenching, gimbal snapping crash to the 9 day turnaround performed by DJI's outstanding Customer Service department, I have personally experienced 5+ STAR service from DJI and I am more than impressed. Thank you DJI for doing everything that you said you would do (and more!) and for continuing to improve in so many areas.< /review>< pictures>

For me the service was great. I was kind of worried after reading the reviews but now that it is all said and done they did a great job. Fixed my Mavic air 2 for free even though I did not have any warranty or anything. From what I can tell they just replaced it with a new model. They only had it in there shop for about 2 weeks which I would say is not to bad. Almost every day they sent me an email telling me what they were doing. I had great experience with Dji so hopefully they are getting much better customer service.<//review>

<date>1606770109368</date><text>I was very skeptical on sending in my drone after it crashed and the gimbal was removed from the original position. I bought the DJI Care Refresh package as well when I bought the DJI Mavic Air 2, so I felt a little better about sending it in.

I was also on a quick timeline because I was moving out of town and needed to to have the drone back in a matter of two weeks.

With all that being said, once you get your case number, you can check the status of your drone and the repair process. Within the first day, I received a notice that they were assessing the damages.

The next day, I received a report of the damages.

The next day, I received an invoice to pay for my replacement drone ($69) for the first replacement with the DJI Care Package.

Then, received my drone the following Monday. So it was a one week turn around. I might've even received that Friday. I can't remember.

However, I am writing a very different review and I was very happy with how they followed through with the DJI care refresh package and also the turn around time. So thank you DJI!< /text>< name>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Probably the worst company I’ve ever dealt with. The drone I purchased was sent months late, had to be fixed before I could even work, and I was able to fly it a handful of times before the $200 battery had problems. No solutions were offered other than to upgrade the firmware, which then caused a problem with the landing gear. Thousands of dollars later, I have an absolutely worthless piece of equipment.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>This company is the worst.  Dishonest and sleezy.  Does anyone know their agent of service so I can service them legal documents to sue them?

They have major software issues that are causing drones to loose connectivity and force land over water, refusing to return home.  This has happened to several people including myself from one store alone.  I am trying to sue them but they will not provide their legal contact.  Chinese have become a very dishonest race as this is one example for a flawed culture.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>Sent my DJI Mavic Mini in for repair (gimbal disconnected and arm broke).

I have read the bad review about this place, and I can't hide that I was really worried to send my controller for repair there, after DJI told me to do so, following a fan buzzing noise in it which needed to be fixed, still under DJI warranty.

I sent the controller to this repair center around Christmas 2018, and got it back on 01-05-2019. And guess what ? They didn't repaired the controller, but sent me what appears to be a new one (or at least nice refurbished one) instead !!

So no complain there, and instant good review from me as well !!</Text>

<text>AWFUL! My controller was bricked. Sent it in under warranty after hours of wasting my time on the phone with techs who literally know less about the product than I do. After a couple of weeks, my new controller came in and guess what. It ALSO didn't work. Great QC, DJI. After wasting more time with tech 'support', I was told I'd have to send this one back too! The best thing they could offer me was expedited shipping on my THIRD controller. Do you think they followed through? Nope! All of the talk is true. DJI is sorely lacking in customer service and quality control. What a shame. They clearly have great engineers and marketing. Everything else is garbage. Once they have your money, they no longer care.< /text>< rating>

I was skeptical before sending my unit in after reading the reviews but,  my experience with the actual repair facility has been totally amazing and fast!   They got right on it and I was able to track on their website each step of the process!  The repair has been made, the cost was covered under the one year manufacture warranty (Including shipping!), it is has been tested and is now in the last phase (Quality Control) before being shipped back to me.  Less than 2 weeks including shipping!!  The call center, more than likely in the Philippines could use more training.<//Review>

Overall it was a good experience.  Once you start a request for repair, they take forever to send you a shipping label.  I waited a week after calling several times to check on it.  Once they received the drone, it didnt take them very long to get me my drone back.< /Review>

<Review>Immediately after updating the firmware on my drone it flew off into a tree. The entire Flight after firmware update was about 10 seconds. I hit launch the drone went up 3.9 ft and it rocketed forward full speed into a tree giving all kinds of sensor warnings as it did so. I sent in the device for warranty support that I paid $149 for when I purchased the drone. After 14 days I got an email requesting my flight records because all the data on the Drone is corrupt. They will not cover the repair because I wont jump through their hoops to supply data for a 3rd time. They want me to download multiple programs to do this and register accounts on non DJI websites to upload the data. The drone Keeps records on an internal SD card and All the flight records are synced to there server from my device. I called customer service to discuss it and they said figure out a way to provide records or they will send me an invoice for the repairs. Clearly If all the data on the drone is corrupt there is a software issue. DJI Should honor this repair but they will not. And they are not even willing to discuss it. I would stay far away. DJI Go app is junk. It freezes and force closes constantly and their customer service is a joke. Go with another company for your Drone needs. Lucky for me there was a tree in the way and it didn't kill someone. 40MPH at 3.9ft. No apology no Sympathy and no one who speaks clear English.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dd35af00000001:0xe5cde01d62d56d57< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>They don't stand behind their product, and their practices are deceptive.  Tech support played dumb about an issue so they could string me along until my warranty ran out.  If you were also wronged by these guys, please consider filing a complaint with the FTC/Consumer Protection Bureau.  If they get enough complaints, they'll go after them.  You can file against DJI CA and also do an international complaint against their headquarters.< /Text><Time>1555631594232<//Time><username>Aly Lester</username>< Gmap_id>

We bought the DJI OSMO ACTION and at first glance, it was awesome. The picture was beautiful, the device easy to work with and a totally unintrusive piece of equipment... WHILE IT WORKED which was exactly 5 days or so :( So I tell myself, "these things happen sometimes", I have a warranty plus additional insurance. Easy Peasy right? NOPE!  Firstly I'm in Italy, which I needed the equipment for AND I can't send the malfunctioning device back til I return to the states IN TWO WEEKS!  But I start the process of dealing with the issue online... I figure out quickly that thats not gonna work so I wait to get back home.
I finally begin with what winds up being a barrage of phone calls only to finally connect to DJI's HORRENDOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE Representatives. Truly the worst I've ever experienced and that is saying a lot.  The Customer Service Rep is asleep, uncaring and super slow and by now I am super frustrated because it has taken me many tries to get them on the phone. I'm talking MANY dropped calls disconnects, or the sound of someone answering and hanging up without saying hello. They simply don't care which in this day and age of Social Media and bad reviews equals to the death of a company! I finally put in a ticket for repair as per their instructions, send the camera back immediately and it takes forever to come back. When it does, ITS BROKEN but in a different way.. They fixed whatever bug it had before and then BROKE the camera speaker :O  SOOOO since this equipment was bought for a work/vacation out of the country, where we were when it stopped working and with two more weeks to go, I was NOT happy!!! I call back, ask to speak to a Supervisor and I'm told by the very bored customer service rep that the Supervisor is not available and that I would receive a callback in 24 -48 hours. When I asked why it took them so long to respond to the customers keeping them n business, he responded that actual company "Protocol" was that supervisors "DO NOT" actually speak to customers. Wait... WHAT? When I repeated that back to him as a question he tried to back track. He repeated that he would put the request in and ask the supervisor to call me BUT that there were MANY others before me waiting for a call as well... Needless to say my camera is still broken and I am waiting for a phone call I do not have a lot of faith in getting. OH and did I mention this had been going on for 2 months now!!!?!!
Buy yourself a GO PRO and skip the DJI Experience of not caring enough for the customers that keep in business!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>BUYER BEWARE!!! THIS COMPANY WILL RIP YOU OFF!! I PURCHASED A DEFECTIVE DRONE LAST SEPTEMBER. AFTER SENDING IT BACK AND FILING A DISPUTE WITH MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY DJI REFUNDED ME. THEN A MONTH LATER THEY REVERSED THE REFUND EVEN THO THEY HAVE THE PRODUCT. THE ONLY WAY TO CONTACT ANYONE IN BILLING AT DJI IS THROUGH EMAIL WHICH THEY NEVER RETURN. I EVEN HAD MY BANK CONFERENCE CALL THEM AND EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND THAT INFACT DJI DOES OWE ME A REFUND AND THEY LITERALLY TOLD US THE BILLING DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE NUMBER THAT EVEN A MANAGER AT DJI CAN CALL. TOTAL BS!! NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THEM TO COURT TO GET MY MONEY BACK. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!! THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIFIC AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THROUGH TO ANYONE. NOTICE THAT THEY WON'T LET CUSTOMERS LEAVE REVIEWS ON THEIR FACEBOOK PAGE AND TOOK DOWN THEIR OTHER GOOGLE BUSINESS PAGES BECAUSE OF ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. THAT SHOULD TELL YOU ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS COMPANY!!</text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dd35af00000001:0xe5cde01d62d56d57</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

DJI defective auto land system is dangerous and damages property, DJI is not taking responsibility
I haven't flown my phantom in a long time, so I went ahead and updated all firmwares(battery,drone,remote control), I then calibrated the drone compass and started my flight. I'm just outside of class Delta and that is where my property is, but for some reason the drone asked me to acknowledge that I'm responsible for the flight in a controlled air space, So i acknowledged and continued on the flight, suddenly the drone started auto landing and the abort button grayed out, it was going to land on people's property I managed to steer it away from that but the drone wouldn't stop descending and finally hit a tree and then the ground, At that point i had no control over the drone's altitude what so ever. DJI refused to fix it and they want me to pay $380 to fix a phantom 3 advanced that as of today 03/18/2019 can be bought for 200-300 new from many retailers. DJI said it is not under warranty, well yeah it is not but when A car company discovers takata airbag issues in their cars they didn't refuse service because a car is out of warranty. DJI auto landing taking over like this and leaving the pilot helpless and not in control causes a hazard on people and property and could seriously harm or injure people. I totally lost my drone in pieces because of something DJI APP did when it took control of my drone. DJI refuses to admit responsibility and will not fix my drone or fix the issue in their app.< /text>

The absolute worst customer service you can possibly get from a company. Dollar Tree has more organization than these people. The entire warranty/service department should be fired. In fact I don't know why you even offer any warranty on your products, nothing is ever fixed or covered "under warranty". I'd highly suggest anyone looking to purchase a drone to NOT buy one of these cheaply made Chinese pieces of garbage. Spend your money and buy something quality from a company that stands behind their products and respects their customers!<//Review>

My experience with DJI service has been filled with lies and poor follow up. DJI continues to deliver the worst customer service in the industry. This is evident by thousands of other dissatisfied customers, like myself, who have posted their horrible DJI service experiences on community boards and other review sites.< /Review>

<name>Derek Damien Darcy<//name><Time>1534793296208<//Time><rating>1</rating><review>Avoid DJI drones. Their customer service & repairs are horrible.  18 month old drone and the controller is acting oddly. When temp is below 80 degrees shows 3 leds on the controller when fully charged, take it into any area with temp above 85 and only 2 of the 4 leds light up when the batttery is fully charged. When you plug it in all four leds should flash while it charges mine has only two flash.  Called, did chat, and even spoke with someone via Facebook.  Their official reply is to send it in for professional diagnosis (for a fee) and they will quote the repair.  A quick internet search shows this is a common problem.  Additionally nearly every update causes problems with the drone.    Buy from a company that supports their product.  May sell my DJI drone and buy. Parrot anafi.< /review>< Pictures>

One of the worst companies to deal with. After our drone crashed due to a software malfunction, dji came up with excuse after excuse (because we kept proving they were wrong) why it was our fault the drone crashed. (Each time we proved their theory wrong, they came up with a new reason it was not their fault. After 6 months of fighting with them, they simply said "we are not going to honor any warranty", and sent the drone to a country I do not even live in!! Oh, and that was my fault too!!! Buy ANYTHING ELSE other than a dji!!<//review>

9 calls 15 hours on the phone in total.  Promised a call back every call and never received one. Sent my vision 2+ in a month ago.  Video feed went out after firmware update.  They sent me a repair invoice for over $200.  Refused to pay as multiple items they stated needed replacement I know were not broke because I just had it apart.   Something is being shipped currently.  I will see what arrives in the mail this week.</text>

Regardless of what DJI support may tell you on the phone, you cannot drop off your repair items here. I found out the hard way after spending way too much time stuck in traffic trying to get there. The door is locked and s security guard will shoo you away, pronto.< /review>

I have had several issues with DJI customer service.  My Phantom 3 Advanced remote control keeps having issues updating, after sending in two different remotes and 4 months later, I still am not able to use my drone.  It has been collecting dust, and upon asking for status, they are quick to reply that they have approved the replacement but are awaiting shipment, which has been over a month now.  I foolishly purchased a new drone (2 months into this process) and ordered some extra blades which were supposedly in stock, however it has been 3 weeks now since I placed the order and I still have not received even a shipment notification.  Upon trying to contact customer service again, they told me the order would be shipped by October 4th.  It has been over a week now and still no shipment.  Worst customer service.  Please be aware of this when you purchase any DJI product, warranty turnaround times can take MONTHS, and correspondence is very spotty.  BUYER BEWARE!!!!</review>

Love the selection of new and well curated used books, for all budgets and interests. Fantastic area for kids too. We always find something there. And they have a great trade-in for store credit as well.< /text>

< review>
So yesterday I checked the place out since it had been so long since I visited. There were two employees there who were helpful and yet one of them kept ranting on and on about politics. The guy got more and more adamant with his political views to the point that he began to put down a political party. It got to the point that I felt very uncomfortable and decided to leave. That being said, customers come to the store to find a good book to read or to browse not to hear political debates.. just my two cents.< /review>

After having a bad day we came in excited to check out a new store. Unfortunately, we were treated with a rude staff that made us feel like a nuisance when questions were asked. After finding the book we came in for (with minimal help from staff) they were incredibly disrespectful & made us feel extremely dumb because of a simple mixup. We left the book store & went down the street to Eureka Books where the staff was very helpful & ordered us the book we were looking for.<//text>

<Response>{'time': 1569793705312, 'text': 'I am so sorry, Brittney, that you had a bad experience at our store!  It is truly our priority to help customers and to treat them respectfully.  I was at work on that day, and I wonder if the mixup had to do with staff asking for identification when using a credit card?  That did happen, and the customer was put out and left before we could offer alternatives.  Since we are readers, we did read the agreement with our credit card processor, and we do ask for ID if a card is not signed, as per that agreement.  Most customers appreciate this but sometimes people feel it is unreasonable.  We do have other options for our customers.  This may not have been the problem you experienced, and no matter what it was, I hope you will contact me directly at the store to discuss it.  Thanks. --Nancy'}<//Response><gmap_id>0x54d155652ebff41b:0x2d2a49691f9392</gmap_id></record>

<review>Local bookstores are a treasure for communities and Booklegger is one of them.  This is a wonderful shop with an ample selection of mostly used books with some new books and other merchandise mixed in.  It is a good browsing bookstore.  The staff are easygoing and helpful.  I appreciate their recommendations when I'm looking for something new and different to read.  They can order a book not in stock, offer a book buy back credit for some gently used books and gift certificates.<//review><Name>Christine Way< /Name>< user>

Booklegger is my favorite bookstore. The staff are delightful, the store is quirky and hosts great books and bookish gear. They have a solid selection of used books and some new books. If you need a book that they don't have, they'll order them for you and mine have always arrived within a week. Great store in the middle of Old Town, owned by amazing women.< /Review>

Great local bookstore in old town. I was in there today actually. (Woah it's like Google knows or something.) Packed wall to wall with all kinds of great books, everything you could imagine. Went in looking for an obscure Ram Dass book, walked out with a Reza Aslan book. It's always a pleasure to browse. I've sold books there years ago, I remember it being a positive experience, details are hard to remember.<//Text>

I love the Booklegger. I've been going to it since I was a little kid, and it really is like a treasure hunt when you go in, you never know what you're going to find. I especially like their DIY vintage poster kits; I now have three in my collection. As long as the Booklegger's still around, I'll keep coming back :)<//text>

<Review>I called asking them if they had time to cut my 2 boys hair cut it was around 6:30pm they said yes as l9ng as I got there before 7pm
I got there at 6:40pm and they locked the door in my face.
Even though I told them I called earlier.

I loved bringing my boys here. I really liked the place but what they did was not okay. It takes a lot to make me write a bad review.

Why would you tell me yes I could go n then close the door on me.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Great selection. Awesome staff. Had everything I needed and more. Highly recommend checking it out. Will never go back to the traditional way of smoking. Vaping is so much better.< /review>

The staff member who worked with me was extremely knowledgeable about the products and helped me choose the right device for me and I love it. I quit smoking cigarettes and only vape now. Great shop, great purchase.</Review>

They don't have a wide selection of mods or juices and they don't mix any juices. Went for a coil and they didn't have a match.  It's really expensive.  They do have a cool looking dome bunker shape building though...unique.</Text>

Great place for vaping needs. They have different eliquids I've tried and some new brands 1st time seeing. I like the historic building and uniqueness. Great staff friendly, and helpful.<//review>

<review>Most expensive place I ever been. They charge for 60 ml reds juice 26 dollars plus tax. So it's about 30 bucks! Average price for this juice is 18-20$ so they 50% overcharge<//review><rating>1< /rating></record>

I drove in from out the city to their small location to see their juice selections and or recommendations on  what's popular in the area. Not much effort or experience on sales or suggestions. I asked if they had samples on some of their popular juices and they offered me a mod with a dry or burned coil. Of all the shops I've attended, this is so far the only shop to ask me to take off the drip tip of my mod to try theirs, when the other shops had disposable tips for you to try and take. One guy holding the shop down, but had no  attempt to sell anything. At the end of my 10 minute visit, I came out with nothing but some bad unicorn bottles. To be open for about three years(they say), I'm not sure what's keeps them going since the kid there made no effort to even thank me for my business.  On to the next one, I guess.<//text>

I initially went to Vape Mastaz because my usual spot I hit was out of the Kanthal gauge I was looking for.

I walked in and the vibe of the spot clicked with me instantly: turntables, various toys, mods and other vape essentials and the service was very disarming, informative and transparent (Nick was cool enough to admit that he didn't have much experience in a certain area...and the honesty was appreciated).  After discussing sub-ohm vaping, vape safety and a variety of build techniques they set me up with some 28 gauge Kanthal and a couple of their pre-rolled, pre-oxidized 400 Stainless Steel mesh sticks. I came home and with what I got at VM and some Eco Wool I already owned built a pretty nice 4 wrap coil (eco wool over ss mesh) that is reading at 1.11 ohms and I'm SUPER hype!

The retail space is small and there wasn't any sitting room, but the spot is still pretty fresh and worth checking out if you don't wanna drive to Alhambra, San Gabriel or any other southern San Gabriel Valley city for vape needs. Nothing wrong with those cities, it just feels good to have some quality vape joints up this way in Pasadena!

Thanks, fellas!

Peace.<//Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><review>I had the pizza bowl which is all the toppings on a pizza with no crust. service was good over the phone, delivery very good also. The pizza was good, fresh and hot. I like it but the more I ate, it became too much meat. I only ate a small amount.I put some on a plain bagel the next day and heated it in the toaster oven and it tasted better. I was missing the pizza bread and it's a personal choice, no fault of Marco's. I would not order it again. Oh, it was costly too. About $17.00 with delivery and I live literally down the street.< /review><userid>101473394510039480068<//userid><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG9cPa4ex6dePZONtMZUhB3BjTeabmPujXb7sb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><GmapID>0x80c297d204e205f9:0x2dbb914431a5c986<//GmapID><user_name>Regina Tatum< /user_name><date>1613175524586<//date>< resp>

Sean, the manager at this location didn't fail to satisfy my itch for great pizza. We encountered a clean store with awesome employees and great customer service. This Marcos location is one my top pizza places to visit when I'm in the area.< /review>

<Review>I'm NOT a pizza fan, but THIS spot is not your typicl pizzeria, at all! I REALLY liked the size slectionS for individual pizzas, that they cook RIGHT in front of you, so it's VERY VERY fresh! HUGE selection of toppings, & for the SAME price they let you get a TON of ANYthing you eant!!!  I'll be going back!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c297d204e205f9:0x2dbb914431a5c986</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ordered old school pepperoni.  Sauce didnt have much flavor.  I've had better old school pepperoni at other places
that were much better. Even Little Cesar's is better.  I usually go to Italian restaurants for pizza.  Will never go back
Pizza was terrible.< /review>

EDIT: After sorting it out, it's not you guys at all. You're golden. The "SLICE" service though, after trying ten ways to Tuesday to have it be me who posted that you guys close at 11pm on the, granted, Google sourced store hours, it's still the hours they had listed and thus that I thought I had time to get there. Been coming to you guys for a few years now and dig what you've got going, Slice may not be as good a representation of you as you are though haha. For what it's worth. Thanks for the follow up! Stand up dudes as usual!

When it’s good it’s great, but can’t trust their posted hours and definitely can’t trust pickup times as they may just close up on you. Happy to change review upon a refund but def screwed up the night and now have annoyed people to deal with. Awesome.<//Text>

<review>Large cheese pizza cut into unequal slices and cuts overlapped as if the pizza was cut in the dark. Chose curbside service and it wasn't brought out. Employee claimed I didn't choose that option. Very expensive pizza and I tipped. Pizza was delicious.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Marco’s Pizza is hands down the best pizza in LA. Stopped in to get a thin crust with the old world pepperoni and the cashier talked us into the crust toppers. Garlic butter and Roma crust. It was fantastic. Overall experience great pizza great staff and you can see into the kitchen and the place is spotless. Super clean! We will be back!< /Text>

But the last few time i went there the pizza wasn't as good, i dont no if they changed the recipe or if they aren't leaving the pizza in the oven long enough. I'm a firm believer if it's not broken don't fix it is so sad that all these restaurants are changing things around when the customers fell in love with the Pacific taste..<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Marco's Pizza in the valley at last!! When I found out my favorite pizza store finally came to Sherman Oaks, I was beyond excited. Marco's Pizza is THE best pizza place hands down. No matter which location you go to, the quality of their pizza is always on point. Their customer service here in Sherman Oaks is great and friendly, making sure that I'm welcomed when I arrive in the store.

I have truly become a fan of their salads along with their subs when I order pizza for friends, family, or just myself. If you have not visited Marco's Pizza yet, you need to go. Their pizza's will forever change your perception and taste buds on pizza; you'll never want to eat pizza anywhere else but Marco's. I suggest the Chicken Fresco pizza, Cheesy bread, the Meatball sub, Greek salad, and the delicious Ghirardelli Chocolate Brownie for dessert.<//text>

Pizza was delivered fast and hot.  They loose two stars for forgetting to add black olives that I paid extra for, and for a pizza that tasted exactly like Pizza Hut.  I HATE PIZZA HUT.  Eck!< /Text>

<Review>With the restrictions lifted in orange county indoor dining is now available at this location. Not to many patrons at 8 am. We were placed several tables away from others and felt very safe and comfortable. The service was quick and friendly. I was told when more people are present they open the outside dining.</Review>< Pics>

Greatest hard working waitress with superb service of top quality food. Worthy of a $20 tip for a $21.00 tab.  A great restaurant experience in a difficult time.  Good job IHOP and your staff.<//review>

This restaurant is the one I like best. I go to a lot of restaurants but to this place I keep coming back again and again. The team is very professional and the cooking they offer is so appetizing. I never miss an opportunity to have a decent meal here. I recommend this place with pleasure.< /Text>

Super slow service, the floor was wet with no warning cones and my grandson slipped and fell hitting the back of his head my son and my wife were talking to the manager when one of waitress came and told my wife and son you know we have video. Who in they're right mind would even say anything after a 3 yr. Old falls and hits he's head. Grandson is fine now.< /Review>

We ate here last November and the dining room doesn't seem so clean: the booths felt greasy when we sat down, and the air feels stale.   Service was very slow and the workers didn't seem so happy.  The food was pretty much what I would expect for an IHOP but this location seemed depressing and unclean.<//Text>

Our server even told us when she was going on break and introduced us to the server that would take over. They both took care of our group. It's nice when your server comes back to the table more than once. Which they did! We even were sent off with a very nice goodbye. I would definitely recommend this IHOP.</text>< username>

Went later in the evening because my elderly mom wanted breakfast for dinner. Place was dead. Food was fresh and really good. Surprised at how good it was. Service by Aaron was excellent.< /review>

Food ok, service great (replaced syrup without being asked, brought check promptly when finished without being asked,was able to pay at table,etc.--not stuff you normally get at a family diner-type place)< /Review>

<text>Where the service is friendly enough, the food usually is served in a timely manner, it has a smell to it. Where the syrup is kept could be a bit cleaner as well as the tables wiped down a bit better. The coffee isn't always fresh - meaning it's not always served hot.  With that said, I do eat there a few times a month because the breakfasts are pretty good. They are currently remodeling- maybe that will help with the smell.< /text>< response>

<Review>Yummy, except that by requesting two slices of French toast instead of pancakes, I was charged two dollars extra and given 4 pieces of toast instead of just the two I wanted.  It seemed unreasonable to me since I wasn't asking for something extra but was asking for a substitution.  It wasn't worth the two extra dollars as the meal itself was priced rather high.

<Text>Ok so when we came on saturday at 5pm  arrived and before we parked I knew it wouldn't be a great experience. Why ? Because the parking lot was deserted... this has to be the slowest IHOP in all of orange county. Any how we didnt turn  back. We went in using the door on the right because the right one was broken.. still we stayed. The table had dried syrup tracks on it.  I ordered the breakfast sampler and honestly the only thing that tasted ok was the hashbrowns .. the eggs needed salt, the bacon was not good (how can bacon not taste good??) The sausages where too crispy and they tasted like cardboard.The pancakes were good. Service was real good. My Son said the bathroom was dirty, toilet clogged and urinal didnt work.  We wont come back. Next time I see an empty parking lot in a restaurant I wont come in. Service was good.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dcd69c5a922ba3:0xc4b5caa24ba2dc5a< /gmapID></record>

I waited an hour just to get drinks and then walked out because that was too long. They consistently are way understaffed. Management needs to know that is no way to run a business. I loved going here my whole life but never again. Terrible. 😞< /Review>

I'm only giving it one star because you have to give a star.  We ordered coffee twice with 2 different servers 15 minutes later we still didn't have coffee. People came in and sat across from us got coffee immediately . No one came to take our, order bring us water, or deliver coffee. this place sucks and I'll never come back here again. They're completely understaffed and the staff that are there don't care.</Text>

Worst service i have seen at an ihop. I just walked in and there is maybe only 2 people eating inside and im the only one waiting in the front to be serviced. The waitress sees me and just walks by and never notifies anyone. Then i can just hear them talking in the back, wow. I will definitely not be returning here.<//Review>

We, the four of us, were seated immediately. The foods offered didn't fully strike me as atypical. It was, however, consistent with prior visits to other​ IHOP's...meaning their quality (and prices) were acceptable and predictable...also meaning this is a business of integrity throughout. Only gripe was personal in that they no longer serve biscuits and gravy (so what?). The service was impeccable. Clean and well lit, I recommend this IHOP to anyone looking for a tasty  breakfast or lunch.< /text>

"This is an appreciated expansion to the Placentia region.

Opening only two or three days prior, one could undoubtedly observe the place still needs a touch of tweaking. It's delightful and clean however fairly meager.

The most critical thing, the espresso. Obtained from a neighborhood roaster, the latte was magnificent. Rich and waiting on the palette, the espresso surpassed my desires!"</text>

Food tastes okay, for the price. The biggest problem with this place is the staffing. I live close to this IHOP and every time my wife and I go there is only one server and one cook and there are always 4 or 5 tables(usually at least one family of 4 or more) with usually one more waiting to be sat or waiting to pay. The staff does the best they can but it takes forever to get service because they are understaffed. This has happened 3 out of the 5 times we have gone. Management needs better staffing but other than that a normal IHOP.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>The wait was only 5 mins because I made the window right before the Sunday rush. My server was excellent. The only downside was where I was seated. Right beside me was the stacked highchairs & they were frequently shuffled right beside me. Still my favorite IHOP in my area though.< /Review>< GmapID>

Took too long to get seated and we we're the only ones waiting! Go figure. So many tables empty and the kid put us in a tiny table. When I asked for a bigger table he told me I would have to wait 10 more minutes!! I said forget it. When my waitress came to our table I asked her if we could move she was very hospitable and said yes. I was thinking what was that other kids problem. Make your guests happy right!< /text>

Had a terrible experience today at Ihop. Both my orderes were made wrong. I had gotten my coffe and no creamers and I told the waiter and she did not bring it. I had to get up to ask again for it because she would not come by the table. I had to get up again to ask for ketchup and napkins. I asked for the bill and they took too long to bring it, I ended up having to go to the front and they had me waiting a long time, I ended up having to leave without the change. Terrible experience and I have been going here for year. They are just getting worse as time goes. This was the last call never returning again.<//Text>

The new crepes with cheesy sauce are delicious! And the beef sliders. This is a very quiet Ihop surrounded by residential. 4 other tables in use at 8pm.</text>

< review>
Martin, the manager, knows how to run this restaurant with efficiency and great customer service.  The IHOP on Lincoln is closer to me but I prefer to make a slightly longer drive to Placentia because I feel at home here.< /review>

Just ok. Restaurant was clean, staff was friendly but foot was overcooked and portions were very tiny. We were a party of five, we had salads and different entrees for each. None of us liked the food.< /review>

We were n this one dec 1, 2015. Very few people, still had to wait. Silverware dirty, food very badly prepare. Waitress said everyone (help) walked out so only one waitress & only one cook. Phone kept ringing. The waitress, the only one did the very best she could...
Will never go back to this one ever or anyone I know. Give that waitress a raise, treat her right b/4 u lose her..< /Review>

<text>If i could give zero stars i would. We walked in with our family after a very long & hectic travel day at 930pm. They close at 10pm. After unloading all 5 kids they wouldn't seat us and were only taking to go orders! NOT OK! If you're often until 10p you should be seating customers until 959pm.

<review>This location is close to my home, but the place needs some serious updating; the electric socket above our table had no cover on it. Prices are too high for a facility in this much disarray. I know the Sunday after-church loves it, but you got 👎👎 from me.</review>< time>

If your sign says you're open till 10pm then you stay open till 10pm, not send customers away at 9:30pm saying "Sorry, it's to go orders only."  Terrible... Will not return to this location.< /text>

<review>Seated right away, waitress was very friendly, and quick. My only complaint is they shouldn't assume all customers are going to want flavored cream for their coffee, we got more flavored cream than regular cream, and didn't have enough for a second cup. It is an inconvenience to have you flag down anow already busy waitress. They should ask before bringing the cream out</review><user_name>Tamara Ritter</user_name>< Response>

< Review>
"I'm only giving this place a five-er because i am hands down in LOVE with IHOP's CORNMEAL PANCAKES. it is cornbread but pancake style. I LOVE cornbread..so if you love it too then go to IHOP asap and order a large stack of cornmeal cakes.

haha. ok, this location is great.. they are very nice and quick with the orders.
i wish they were open late.. but they close really early just like everything else in placentia."</Review>
