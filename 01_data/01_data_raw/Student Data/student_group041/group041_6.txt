We were regulars here on Sundays, with our two boys and our little white and grey husky, seated outdoors. Victor was usually our waiter and he poured us bottomless Sangiovese (maybe sympathetic to parents :) Sometimes the owner would bring us tiramisu on the house. This place has great Marsala and truffle gnocchi when that special is available, and otherwise dishes for everyone including pasta w butter for the kids. This rating is about the staff, family friendly and authentic Italian hospitality. We miss you Spumoni and hope we get to see you soon!< /Review><time>1618103664603</time>< Pics>

Surprised to receive a burnt pizza from my favorite place today. I never had this experience in the past so I am very disappointed today.</review>

This restaurant is obviously one of the tastiest restaurants in the neighborhood. Every time I come there I am greatly happy. They always keep their high  level service and the topmost level of dishes  they offer. You will be always satisfied with this restaurant. Highly  recommended.</Review>

<review>I love Dave's Hot Chicken! I remember when the line curved alongside the other businesses but now they have multiple locations across LA. Now, their service is speedy and the chicken is the best.

Order the tender and slider it's more than enough for one person. I usually get the hot level it is not that spicy. Don't forget to check in on yelp for a free side or drink.</review>< rating>

This is authentic Italian although a little pricey but normal for the area.  Good for families or with friends.  You must try the home made gnocchi with a giant portion!  The anti pasta platter and cannolis are worth it, too.

Pizza was a bit bland. The sauce had no flavor, the meat had no flavor. The crust was done but no underlining flavor.
We do not have covid, so our taste buds are functional.
Some Italian seasonings would be helpful.

If the attempt is to appeal to everyone in a bland way, they succeed, no one would accuse this pizza of being too spicy.</text>

Consistency, quality, affordable,  and amazing ambiance.  We had a family dinner from this restaurant. We enjoyed the food so much. Especially the pizza,  it tastes so good and heavenly. The food and drinks served quickly.  The place was fancy and elegant.  The waiters were so friendly and accommodating as well.<//review>

One of my favorite restaurants. I feel at home here and I'm not sure why. Maybe because the food is very comforting for me. I've tried almost everything on their menu and don't really have anything to complain about. My favorite dishes are the mussels, the pate (which they don't have anymore), the cavatelli, the wagyu ribeye steak, and the slow roasted lamb neck. They change some items on their menu time to time but I'd wish they bring back the pate. It's always busy here so I highly recommend making a reservation weeks in advance, or even months in advance if you're looking for a specific time and date.<//Text>

Delicious but soo expensive =\ I'm glad their parking rate is low. Love love love their cinnamon pineapple!! Creamed corn is a must! My fav cuts of meat are Pichana, rib eye and bottom sirloin. My absolute favorite thing in the world is their coconut flan I seriously dream about it!! If it wasn't so expensive I would probably be a frequent customer. But for now, it's only for special occasions...</text>

This photo really does not do this meal justice. The gnocchi funghi was delicious.  When we are in the area (almost every week) we try to stop by and have a meal! Wait staff is great, meals are delicious, seems like there are a lot of long time customers in the restaurant whenever we are there. Great location as well. Delicious desserts!<//Review>

Hostly this is place is not good. I feel like they cut costs everywhere. I ordered a $21 pasta for lunch and had dehidrated frozen chicken, watery sauce, undercooked broccoli, and crappy cheap pasta. But hey, the bread is good.< /Text>

A nice place, but barely any vegan options. I ended up making my own pizza, which was okay, but could be better. My family's no vegan reviews were better, but I wouldn't recommend for vegans!</text>

Coming from the east coast NY NJ area was worried about finding good Italian food out in LA. This place was AMAZING and I've already been there twice in one month. Attentive staff, incredible food.</review>

We had a dinner here together with co-workers and had a good experience.  Service was impeccable, and our meals were simply perfect, I wouldn’t have changed a thing! even though a bit pricey but worth the cost you are paying for.<//text>

I accidentally went on a Monday night when they're having their half of food special (May 2018). Our waiter was nice but was kind of in over his head. Didn't get bread or our drink orders and it took way too long to get the check. The food was good though. I'll come back again on a different night.< /Review>

< review>
A friend invited me to lunch this week here and it was fantastic. We arrived just in time to order the lunch specials, served til 3:00pm. I ordered the cheese pizza with their house salad. Steven the waiter greeted us with warm bread, whuch they make daily, and served with oil and balsamic vinegar. I believe the cook waits for the diners to finish their starters before cooking the entrees, keen eye. I was starving and are all my salad and cheese pizza. The best part is yet to come, when Steven brings over the most delicious Spumoni ice cream I've ever tasted, and made in house. Wow!!! Parking is in back of restaurant and they do have outside dining of you like. Lunch specials were priced low so 2 people could eat for around $25. Great place on Montana that serves awesome Italian food with great employees and say hello to the owner, he's usually around.< /review>

Acquaintance of mine loves this place and we met up for dinner there recently. We finished the mussels (fine) and started on our pasta (we were sharing one portion). because it came out soon after the appetizer, it got cold and needed to be heated up. When the waiter brought it back, our separate portions from our own plates that we respectively started to eat were mixed together on one plate!   When we raised the issue, the waiter just shrugged his shoulders.  Unhygienic and disgusting.</Review>

My third trip to visit my granddaughter who lives nearby and my first stop at Spumoni’s... it is amazing ambiance and pizza and pasta and wine and sports TV... great wait staff... perfect location for many AirBnB’s... you can bring your own bottle for a cork fee... I will be back in many visits to see my granddaughter!</Text>

Highly recommend this yummy little restaurant. Great service and delicious fettuccine alfredo! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I didn't care for the table we sat at. Very warm sitting by the kitchen and the table is right up against a window with another table on the outside right up against the window. The table  outside  on the patio situated right up against  a common window. Uncomfortably close to the people on the other side, quite awkward. Certainly there is a better way to configure the tables outside.</Text>

<Text>It's been awhile since I've been here, so I wanted to post an update. Came by for lunch last week and was so impressed. The food was incredible. I had the vodka pasta and my husband had the carbonara - both were flavorful and perfectly prepared. The bread and olive tapenade they bring for free is excellent. I had an arnold palmer which was a bit too sweet for my liking, but otherwise everything was great. Prices are high, but normal for Montana. Space is good - nothing fancy, but they have an outside patio. Waitstaff is attentive and friendly. A solid Italian offering in the neighborhood. Excited to try the pizzas and something from the gnocchi bar.< /Text>< gmapID>

Very impressed with Spumoni. They had made a mistake with my original order and when I spoke to Fausto at Spumoni, he offered a complimentary meal to be redelivered. I travel to Italy often and Spumoni has absolutely a great menu and great food, very impressive. A great restaurant with great service! Thank you Fausto!<//Review>

< review>
Do not bother with this restaurant .. service is horrible!  If negative ratings are available on Yelp, this restaurant deserves it.
Menu mentions they serve gluten-free pizza but when trying to order gluten-free bread they can't get it right and asks if you mean garlic bread and serves burnt bread after an hour!!
Manager is Cesar and he does not know customer service is important and does not rectify the situation.
Again, by all means avoid dining at this restaurant!
It's never worthwhile to dine at a restaurant with bad customer service or bad management!</review>

Today was the first time I went to this restaurant. It was 11 30 am  and we were the first customers for the day . The service was outstanding.The owner was there and he was welcoming and fun.  The food was delicious. As someone who spends a lot of time vacationing on  the Amalfi Coast and spoiled by the amazing real italian food I have to admit that my skirt steak salad tested almost like the salads that I am use to in Positano or Ravello. The seasoning was liTE yet flavorful and the meat was grilled to perfection. I would add some pine nuts but that's me . The coffee was fantastic  and the prices are incredible. I strongly recommend this beautiful place and I cant wait to visit their Mexican restaurant that is apparently right across the street.<//Text>

Management and service was horrible- from the moment we sat down. It took about 10 minutes for He waiter to come over and then to get us water. Then another few minutes to take our order. We asked for GF bread. It took  4 times asking different bidders, waiters and even management. And it didn't even come until after we received our entrees. It ended up coming out over cooked and burnt.  It appetizing.
The management did not even come over to us and ask how everything was at any point or say anything- a bit surprising for the type of venue this is. It even took the waiter a while to ask these questions. The interesting thing was that he was very prompt about the table next to us.
Lucky one of the busser was attentive to us.

When it came time to pay the bill the manager refused to offer us dessert or any kind of comp. The only apology that came from anyone was the busser. And that simple apology was appreciated.

Note for the future: the customer is always right. And it's not very polite, nor is it professional to argue with staff in front of customers.

So if you're coming here expecting great service... probably the place for you! If you're expecting OK food... sure. Then again it could've been just a very off night for the entire restaurant, but who knows.</review>

(Translated by Google) Very cozy, clean restaurant with starched textile napkins on the tables, freshly baked aromatic bread and impeccable service. Plus the presence of a good wine list and delicious Italian beer.
Excellently prepared food gives a good cook who knows a lot about Italian cuisine. Prices are above average.
However, you can eat inexpensively during lunch hours: a hearty business lunch starts at $ 11.
The restaurant is very popular with locals. Often at the entrance you can see a long line of visitors of a very respectable appearance who want to attest to their presence in this institution. And this fact is perhaps the best evidence of the success of the restaurant.
If you couldn’t sit down at one of the cozy tables, do not despair! The restaurant has home delivery service. As they say, any whim for your money. Enjoy!

(Original)
Очень уютный, чистый ресторанчик с накрахмаленными текстильными салфетками на столах, свежеиспечённым ароматным хлебом и безупречным обслуживанием. Плюс наличие хорошей винной карты и вкуснейшего итальянского пива.
Отменно приготовленная еда выдаёт хорошего повара, знающего толк в итальянкой кухне. Цены выше среднего.
Однако, поесть недорого можно в часы обеда: сытный бизнес-ланч начинается от 11 долларов.
Ресторан весьма популярен у местных жителей. Нередко при входе можно увидеть длинную очередь из посетителей весьма респектабельного вида, желающих  засвидетельствовать своё присутствие в данном заведении. И это обстоятельство является, пожалуй, лучшим доказательством успешности ресторации.
Если присесть не удалось за одим из уютных столиков, не отчаивайтесь! В заведении имеется доставка еды на дом. Как говорится, любой каприз за ваши деньги. Enjoy!</text>

< Review>
Just left Staples after talking to an associate (Skylar?).  He was very helpful in helping us select a printer.  I wish all associates were this helpful. The workers at the Hemet location were downright rude. We will definitely make the drive to come to this one in the future.< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><review>Luke was one of the most helpful cashier I’ve ever experienced. He truly enjoyed his job and made sure that my exchange was easy and worry-free. I had tried to make an exchange several times before, and Luke was the only cashier who was able to make the exchange. He has improved my opinion of my local Staples and truly made it one of my top places for school supplies. I’d recommend this store, mainly because of Luke’s amazing customer service. Can’t wait to go back next time.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I went in to make a simple photo color copy of a picture.  Not only were they incapable of pulling up to the photo through email without distorting it, but then they said the only way for me to have it done was to use one of their computer terminals which I needed to pay to use per minute on top of the dollar charge for the color copy.

Staples is dying, let them die.< /text>< pics>

<Text>Had everything we needed and the staff were friendly.

As a brick and mortar I understand that it is expensive to staff and stock, but the store felt barren and quiet. I had to wait in the checkout line to ask for help finding something I needed and there was no floor staff available to assist me.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<username>John Gardner<//username><text>Clean store with adequate parking. Friendly staff and management. Convenient location on Madison avenue in Murrieta. Great place to start your adult coloring-book hobby; with lots of books and pencils to choose from. I wish I could drive along the strip-mall front over to the Big Lots store, but you need to get back out on to the avenue; please consider building an easement across the culvert for a boost in business traffic.</text>< Date>

Really both of the ladies at the office service desk were quite unprofessional. To make a long story short they were limited compared to Office Depot and got out as soon as I could.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Next to Best Buy - somewhat different business model. Needed SSD drive to replace my Laptop HD. Had to get at BB since they have bigger selection. BUT - talked to 5 folks for help in BB without getting simple questions answered. Called Staples - unfortunately not in stock. Went into Staple to ask about SATA cable and cloning. No problem they knew exactly what I was talking about; spent time answering questions. They also had the price/configuration if I wanted to get a new laptop. Shop Staples for great help and then go online.< /Text>< pictures>

This store needs to make sure that the prices on their selves are accurate. I purchased ink toner and they charged me way beyond to what the actual price. Good thing I check their websites and bam! Their prices are way off. I Went back to the store to have it adjusted and the person who help me seems very unhappy about it. I told her who ever does their price accuracy needs to get on top of it or else they are overcharging their customer without their knowledge and it is not cool. So beware shopping to this store. Go check their  website first and if you can purchase it online do it and they have 1 hour pick window. This store might be in violation of Business and Profession code- BPC Division 5. I wont be shopping to this store again.< /Text>

So my 14 year old son saves up his money to purchase a screen for an old iPhone 6 Plus I had on 11/24/2017 (I had upgraded to the IPhone X) the IPhone 6 Plus I had however needed its screen replaced, as I mentioned, so he got the screen replaced for his new phone with his hard earned money at our local Staples, that was the only catch so I gave him the phone and the phone line. He went to Staples and paid $139.99 for the screen replacement from this place. He ended up getting a 20% discount for being Black Friday. He also purchased a Heavy Duty Outter Box to protect his phone at same time that he got his screen replaced from this Staples location and the same guy who replaced the screen ended up putting it in the Outter Box for him right after he replaced the screen at Staples, my son never touched or inspected the phone before having it put in the case from the guy (We have the receipt for both purchases as well time stamped) So here we are two weeks later and his phone is having issues so we take it to Staples to let them know about the issues and the General Manager, Scott Burnosky, receives my sons phone and asks for my son to take it out of the case which he does and we give it to him. The General Manager, Scott Burnosky, looks at the phone and does not say one thing about any cosmetic issues with my sons phone at the precise moment that he inspects my sons phone. He then proceeds to take my sons phone and says he needs to wait for his technician to replace the screen which comes in at noon. Well at this point Im expecting to get a phone call at 12:30 or 12:45, well I receive a phone call at 2:00 PM two hours later?? Then a guy by the name of Dustin proceeds to tell me, first words out of his mouth, you left your phone here for a replacement but it has a small hairline crack so it's not covered? I'm like what? I tell Dustin the timeline of events and let him know we didn't see any hairline crack nor did his General Manager, Scott Burnosky, either or any issues for that matter when we left phone, I also tell him that the phone has been in a case the whole two weeks he's had it, he then becomes sarcastic and says just because you have an Outter Box you can still crack phone! Really!! He states that he will call me back and see what he can do but it's not covered and very direct. He calls back at 2:34 (30 minutes later) and says we can give us a discount if we’d like on a new screen but they can't warranty it?!? I tell him I will be down to talk to the General Manager, Scott Burnosky. I drive down with my son to Staples and when I arrive the General Manager, Scott Burnosky, tells me that the phone had a hairline crack so he can't replace the screen. I explain that why he didn't mention the crack before I left it with him? He states he didn't see it, I also ask him how much would the replacement be he says $160 (that's $20 more then we originally paid before the discount the first time) but he can give me a 20% discount on that??? (To replace this screen it's $150 at Apple for an original btw) Seriously I told the General Manager, Scott Burnosky, how can you take advantage of a 14 year old boy this way? You're asking him to pay over $260 in less then a month for a screen, not to mention the $60 case he purchased from your store, and he's never dropped the phone nor has he taken it out of the Outter Box and you never mentioned a crack! Now there’s a crack? Way to take advantage of a child Staples! I’m not going to have my son give you crooks his money I’ll just go to Apple and do it right! **Buyers Beware of this Sleazy Run Place**</Text>

<review>Won't let you return unopened print cartridges after 30 days.  Some of us keep a spare set but that plan seems to backfire if the printer fails.  Now I get to try to sell the cartridge via Craigslist.  Won't be getting cartridges there any more.<//review>< pics>

The service professional Jose who has been coming to out house for over a year has always done a great job. He always calls ahead of time to let us know what day and time he will visit. This is important to us because we have a small dog so we keep it inside because 1)so she doesn't bother Jose when he is working and 2)she doesn't sneak out an open side door when Jose is working.
We are thankful for Jose's professionalism and the great job he does for us.<//Text>

Terrible customer service and expensive. Called them to come out and handle a gopher problem. They charged $600 to place three of these gopher traps which you can buy on Amazon for $24. After placing the traps they never bothered coming back to check on them. Had to call them repeatedly and finally got them to come check on the traps after 4 weeks had passed by with no results. Would not recommend. Still have the gopher destroying the lawn and out $600.</review>

My technician was professional and thorough.  I received a call before the visit to discuss the service.  He went above and beyond to make sure we covered everything needed including items I had forgotten and he reminded me about it.  He came and executed all items we discussed.   He checked in with me before and after the service call.  I was impressed and quite satisfied.  Thank you.</Text>

Since I get service on a timely basis I do not have a ant problem,  thank you so much for that.   also like the fact that your company contacts me when my service is due.

This company is awful.  They forced me to sign up for some ongoing "maintenance" agreement that I didn't need, then they made it basically impossible to cancel.  They don't answer the phone, leave you on hold, then are basically no help.  DO NOT USE THEM.<//review>

Used them (Terminix Gardena) to tent my house for termites. I was assured that there was sufficient room between the house and the bushes that the bushes would be outside the tent and should survive the tenting. They subcontracted out the tenting service and their subcontractor pulled the tarp over one of my cypress trees killing it instead of running the tarp between the tree and the house.  I selected them because they were one of the few companies that would tent a house with solar panels on it. None of the solar panels were damaged.
Update: Sent email to Terminix as requested. Had a voice mail left on my phone, said to text when available to talk. Texted - no call back received.
Update: They installed bait traps for subterranean termites. Damaged concrete when installing. The technician said they would send somebody out to repair the concrete. Got a phone call this morning about the work, reiterated to the caller that this was a concrete repair. About 9:30 got an email saying the service was complete. Nothing was done, security cameras show that Terminix was never on the property. Lowered my rating from 3 Stars to 1 Star.</Text>

Absolutely horrible and disgusting experience. The lady on the phone was extremely rude and racially bias. The Gardena branch, (and the company overall was extremely horrible). The charge you a ton, and they BARELY apply any treatment. They came over two times and NOTHING changed. I recommend you buy the pest control sprays from amazon and treat your own house. The technician was extremely rude and barley spend 10 minutes around the house. Never use this company and never waste your money and time.< /Review>

This is the worst in customer service I have ever experienced in my lifetime!!!! No one knows what's going on with our account. They have my account and my brother's account mixed up.
They say they will call you back and they don't!!! Then yhey show up when you're not home saying that you missed them!!! What the heck!! How can I missed you when the appointment wasn't even conformed???
The managers are just as bad because they don't call you back and it has just been phone tag for 2 monyhs trying to get someone to get out here to my house to correct the problem that I have been faithfully paying every month.
I have completely lost my faith in this company.
Hey Terminix have you heard of a Lawsuit???? It's definitely being brought against this office. Horrible experience...< /text>

They gave me an estimate to take care of my pest problem which I agreed to, and I comply with my part of the agreement 6 mom passed and they never got my problem solved, instead I don’t know why but. For some reason they sprayed over my printer and they messed it up I had to buy a new printer, thank you very much termini for the extra expense for me of course and other things, that I  don’t want to remember any more because it just makes me angry, it’s just a waste of time and lots of money, because they are not cheap nop not cheap<//review>

I've read reviews of people that have had bad experiences with Terminix but all of experiences have been EXCELLENT! Customer service has been very courteous and all of the technicians that have come are very efficient, courteous and awesome at getting rid of the pests! Dave and Gonzalo are my favorite duo so far! They work out of the Gardena, Ca branch.< /Text>

< Review>
We contracted with Terminix in Gardena to do a tenting service to rid the house of termite infestation. The first person who came out did an estimate, and we looked at other companies, too. We chose Terminix. The next person who came out was overly aggressive and demanded full payment in advance, which we were not comfortable with. We called the office and they sent Travis Wilson to continue the process. At first, he was thorough and nice. He did another estimate that included things we didn't want to do. We scheduled the treatment.
A roofing inspection was done before the treatment, and there were only 8 damaged tiles. It was then that we discovered that Terminix does NOT do the actually tenting, it's done by a company called PEST. They were not careful removing the tarps, and when a follow-up roof inspection was done, they had damaged 89 tiles. We paid for insurance to repair up to 45 tiles, but this was excessive. And now, Travis is no longer with the company and we're getting the runaround. We will probably have to take PEST to small claims court, because Terminix has mandatory arbitration. DO NOT USE TERMINIX FOR TERMITE SERVICE. Terrible experience.</Review>

If I could rate lower than a 1 star I would. This Terminix location Gardena, CA is absolutely awful! An employee named Travis Wilson is a very dishonest and deceitful person! Do not trust him. Do not sign anything on an IPAD have it printed and read it. Amounts were changed and phone calls ignored. Calling to complain is an endless amount of phone calls that are looped and ignored. Dates were changed for work that was done and the workers only showed up 1/2 a day for each day. Work could have been done in a day and a half. WARNING DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE!< /review>

I would rate them -1 if possible, especially the Gardena office of Terminix (manager Glen Foster and staff) - as well as the corporate location in the southeast - they are all absolutely inarguably completely INCOMPETENT (which may be too kind). I won't revisit the horror story details at my residence (which would make your head spin) as it will raise my blood pressure to an unhealthy level - suffice it to say they are untrustworthy and when pressed - outright rude! Any attempts to raise a concern outside the designated local office to corporate IS SYSTEMATICALLY DESIGNED to place you in an endless circle of miscommunication and false promises, hoping you give up and go away. It took me over 6 MONTHS to reconcile my issues, and only then because I was able to get a consumer watch reporter involved with the parent company (ServiceMaster) - which finally resulted in a response from the DM (Robert Davis - who I'd been chasing for months but was ignored) - and eventual partial resolution. Otherwise I was heading to litigation as my last resort.They were all smiles and false promises until I cut the check - then degraded into monsters! Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere!</Text>

<Text>Walk up, pay, if slow, go 25 feet to 1st tee. There are mats to hit off of but four or five holes are uneven so hitting off ground or lowered tee is a must. Spoiler alert: ninth hole aim left and play off hill. Don't miss right, there's no escalator 🤪< /Text>< Pics>

My wife and I played on a Saturday morning in June and had a fun and relaxing time. No waiting. The greens were slow and true.
We will be back.
Beautiful scenery. Nice people. Only thirteen dollars.<//Text>

<Review>Okay Indian food has its special really good spices and special rice and is authentic..This place is the worst Indian food I have ever had I could not even finish my food..the spinach is not blended like it is supposed to be and not flavourful it is more amaericanized and the rice was even far from being Indian not even the right color and too thick...the spinach was warmed on a skillet while I was waiting just not good. Would not recommend if you want the real authenticity.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

I was surprised with their offerings in terms of the depth and breadth of the menu as well as how good the food was. All of the food I had was made to order and not put on the grill or pulled out of the cold table until it was being prepped for my order.

There are 2 reasons why they don't get 5 stars. The first is that I came about 45 minutes before closing and it was clear that they tried to prep as little as possible for my order, including squeezing a sauce bottle to death and skimping on sauce so they wouldn't have to make more/refill it. Secondly, all of the ingredients looked and tasted fresh except the lettuce which I watched them pull out of a pre-mixed bag. As good as the shawarma style lamb was, it couldn't mask the pesticide tasting, low effort lettuce they topped my naan tacos with.

With little effort, they could take Tikka Bowl to a 5 star experience and I thin this place has crazy potential.

Pictured below is an example of how they can really shine. These are tikka masala paneer fries. They were absolutely amazing.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpmIiv4TOXj8TQahvQKfNuPq0skq2uWdItVjg-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c34a1bbc70264d:0x152e6a8ef911034<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Randomly found this spot and really enjoyed it. Manager greeted me with a smile and helped me choose the best item. I ordered the shrimp tikka bowl. It was freshly made and delicious . I also tried the mango smoothie and it was very refreshing. 10/10. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn’t tried it. You won’t be disappointed.<//Text>

<Time>1570840008070</Time><Review>Tikka is inside the Victoria Gardens food court. After having eaten in all of the food places here, I decided to give Tikka a try. I ordered the Lamb Biryani rice and I got full satisfaction of the delicious spice and flavor. In the beginning I thought there was not enough meat but there were a good portion of lamb meat under the tasty saffron rice. I was satisfied and happy. Just a warning! Biryani has yogurt (dairy) so if you are "lactose intolerant" like me then, you have been warned! I highly recommend the place.< /Review>< Pictures>

two days ago was our first time in this excellent restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last. We enjoyed the evening a lot with the attentive service, with the excellent  food and booze and with the honest payment. We will absolutely go back there again.< /Text>

< Review>
Waited 30 minutes for tikka bowl and a gyro. They seemed disorganized and short staffed. This is in a food court and I expected faster service. They had no rice available and that would have been a 25 minute wait alone. Food tasted good at least!  Also I noticed they were handling money and then handling food and not washing hands or using gloves.< /Review>

<text>We ate here and loved the food. Specially the chicken tikka masala fries are amazing! The price is also affordable. We spent much less here for tasty food than we would have at any of the restaurants in Victoria Gardens. It took some time to get our food but we typically go to Victoria Gardens when we're having a lazy, uneventful day so we're never on any type of schedule. This will definitely be our choice for food when we are looking for flavorful food at a low price. It's so nice to see something other than pizza and hot-dogs in a food court.< /text><user_name>Adnan Karim</user_name>< Gmap_id>

I was craving a beef Gyro an I give it a try.
I nottice the only person at the register was on his cell phone as I interrupted him to
make my order and didn't wait to long for my food during all the time we spend there eating and talking the employee never taked time to wash his hands and continuing back and ford to the register and coock.
I just find this not so apropiate and not safe for a food service.<//text>

I had the Chana Masala, Mango Lassiter and Mint Lemonade. They were all good and exceeded my expectations. The main reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because it's not 100% authentic Indian food. It's somewhat fusion Indian food. For example, there are Chicken Tikka tacos. Really? That means the food is somewhat compromised and more traditional items get omitted.</Text>

Didn't care much for the customers waiting in line while they sat in back. Only had chicken at mid day. Not impressed. My food just tastes of onion.</text>

< Review>
Very good, just wished they would use accurate measurements when cooking, depending the cook is the spice level, even when asking for no spice, mild, moderate or indian spicy, it always depends on who is cooking. I have asked for spice on one plate and none on the other and it was vice versa, spice wise. Hopefully the spice/hot level could always be the same, but food wise, all their dishes are very tasty!!!! Just order a lot of naan in case it's too spicy for you.< /Review>

Extremely helpful and wonderful staff, who are friendly and attentive. Staff makes goes out of their way to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. Very quick response time to plumbing and other issues that may come up.

The complex looks amazing, and is taken care of. Kind and family friendly community, with wonderful amenities.

Great location as it is within walking distance of a shopping center, Lake Elizabeth, and BART.<//review>

<Review>Extremely happy to be one of the residents here at this amazing facility!

Monika Kaur from the leasing office ensured a very streamlined, transparent, and smooth move-in experience! Starting from the application process to moving in all the way through settling down - she guided us through the process.

The facilities inside the campus is pretty clean and well maintained. Heaven for toddlers with the playground and indoor swimming pool!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I had been visiting more than 10 communities in Fremont and had one of the best experience visiting the apt. Monika was very helpful and patient when I had any question, and the maintenance guy was very nice as well.
This place is quiet, clean and lovely. Rent is probably a little bit higher than the average, but I don't feel overpriced. Recommended.<//review>

< Review>
My overall experience was great. There are a lot of parking spaces available inside the community. The apartment I chose was nicely renovated and moving-in was very smooth for me. My leasing agent Monika was very helpful and she went above and beyond to assist me during the entire application process. She also kept in touch to make sure everything is in order and working well on my end.<//Review>

Overall an excellent service and pleasant experience .</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Have been living in this community for almost 3 years and our experience so far is extremely satisfying. We had very positive experience working with property management including Marisol Jayne and Mark. Also the maintenance team has been very responsive to the requests. This property has some really good features for kids.  Having two pools (one covered) is a plus and very well maintained. The management offered rent revisions by lowering the rates to be competitive in the market. This is something I was not expecting. I recommend living in this community when looking for a good option in Fremont.< /review>

<review>They started the construction right next to our door in a month after we moved in. The noise is so loud it’s impossible to BE inside, not telling even about working from home. Before we moved in they assured us that the construction won’t be in our building, but in another one.
After you sign lease agreement don’t expect the management to address any of the issues. And don’t believe a word of what they say before you sign the lease.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Great complex in a very convenient location, close to all transport facilities, schools, parks with ample food choices combined with a great customer service team (Monika and co) who are there to answer any queries and help resolve matters instantaneously.

All the above is a recipe for a happy home.

Keep up the great work.< /text>

Really satisfied with the move in process, Monika from the leasing office really helped us move in very smoothly.

< review>
Nice apartments, great floor-plans, brilliantly accessible to all sorts of stuff, from BART, to Lake Elizabeth, Kaiser medical facilities, COSTCO...it's a fantastic location. Monika (Leasing Agent) was fantastic showing us around the complex, answering all of our questions honestly, and with lots of context. Incredibly affordable ($2,650) 2-bedroom / 2 bathroom units with Washer/Dryer in unit...NO JOKE...WASHER / DRYER IN UNIT! This is insane for the bay area. Fremont is a great city, to boot. For those of you who are reading the negative reviews, make sure you take into account the items being brought up. Getting towed, paying late fees, appliances breaking down...this is what happens in apartment buildings all across the nation. I've yet to speak to anyone who has lived at The Presidio who said that their work orders for maintenance were never fulfilled, or that their neighbors were overly loud or rude, or that the management team was unreasonable. It an apartment complex, for Christ's sake. There are rules and regulations. You also live above and below families and people with all sorts of quirks and habits. If you don't like some of the noises you hear after 8am and before 10pm, then maybe buy a house in the middle of a forest.

***UPDATE - 3/25/2021 ***

We had our first interaction with the maintenance team today. They did not disappoint. They responded quickly to our requests, and were thorough in their service. 3 of the 4 initial items we discovered during our move-in were simply due to a lack of understanding with how the appliances worked or what light-switches controlled what outlets. The other cosmetic issue we requested service on was documented and scheduled for repair quickly. Santos Castro, our maintenance rep helped me understand how our apartment functions without making me feel stupid, even though I admitted as much...that I was stupid...because I was. Overall, he was excellent, helpful, and if he's any indication of the kind of support the maintenance crew typically provides, then they're a good crew.<//review>

Also, beware of Building E. There is some kind of major plumbing issue in the building that they are not up front about. It will require the water to be shut off every other month for 3-4 hours and they will give you only a 24 hours heads up that these repairs are going to happen.<//text><user_name>Erin Morioka</user_name>< date>

<Review>Update: Thanks to the Property Manager, Linda for a quick turnaround. She understood my concern and sent a technician to fix the issue.

Worst management. They sent a bunch of people(7 members) into the unit to change all the switch boards and water taps even though there are no issues with it. Those people touched each and every part of my house which is really scary considering the pandemic situation. Don’t know what they did, now half of my switch boards stopped working for which i’m afraid to call them to fix it.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808fc08c8b7782cd:0x1a7273519c1590d3<//Gmap_id><user_id>102429770434077046968< /user_id>< date>

Worst community to move in. Residents need to see map and decide on the apartment they need to move in as community doesn't allow residents to see actual apartment and we did the same. To our surprise, the day when we came to collect keys for move in, we got to know that the map displayed on website was wrong and the apartment is actually on the opposite side with no natural light. We had no option but to move in and was told by the management to send them an email so that they can fix the issue. Nobody from management followed or bothered to check with us on the same. Later when we followed up, its been 1 month already but we are not getting any response and still waiting without being able to settle down or unbox our stuff so that they are able to help us. We waited for 2 months just to find out right apartment for us, left many good apartments in other communities, had to pay to movers for the shifting cost and this is what we got. Since, we have been going through this mental harassment, we are writing this review to help others who might be thinking of moving here. I wish I had option to give negative stars.</text>

I lived in Presidio for about 4.5 years and I should say I have a very pleasant experience. First and prime most, the apartment is a very safe community. It is a gated one, unlike most others in Fremont. The management team led by Mohammed are all wonderful, esp. Marisol, Jayne, and Mark who is not working there now. The management often conducts parties for Christmas/Summer/etc. The swimming pools are great, with an indoor one too. There is a play area now that small kids enjoy. It's a lively place to live in. It get's a little bit louder near the play area so I would suggest to take a look at all the available units and choose the one if you want a quiet unit. The apartment units are getting renovations and they look more beautiful now with newer appliances and hardwood flooring. Keep in mind there will be issues in the community like any other communities. But you can request for a service request on the phone or by calling them, and they are attended immediately for emergency issues. There is an after hours emergency line too. The maintenance staff, Jose, Mario, and all the others are also very nice people. I would highly recommend anyone to this apartment community in Fremont.< /text>

Community has heated pool and regular pool, which such a good feature to have.
Staff is very cordial and maintenance staff is also good.
Would recommend to check this apartment</Review>< Pictures>

<review>I am currently living in one of the apartment home in the Presidio. They are dishonestly charging late fee to me since their auto-payment system failed last month. They are charging people for their own mistake. My son's bike's wheel was also stolen 4 months ago. There are rarely seen cockroaches in the apartment..........They resolved some of the issues above so I changed the review.</review>< rating>

<review>The way they rent apartment doesn't sound quite usual, to me.

I went their to enquiry as it's looks like a heaven for Bart commutes, as one block after Fremont Bart station.

They asked for a deposit and an application with a fee, which leads to a credit check, before even shows the original apartment.

As per their procedure, as I spoke with then on an enquiry, they only clean and make it ready to view, I'm not speaking of rent here just to VIEW, only when someone applied for the apartment, That's something strange to me.

Definitely I'm not the one who apply for an apartment before I see what's I'm applying for move-in, sorry!!

They offered me a virtual tour of model apartment on computer and said every apartment has the same layout.<//review><Date>1517077082200<//Date>< gmap_id>

The freezer stopped working in my apartment and was never fixed despite repeated requests. The freezer was only cooling the stuff just like the main fridge. Those going to live in apartment R307 ensure that you don’t face this issue. Overall, I had several bad experiences and would not recommend this apartment.

Fire alarm kept beeping in my apartment due to low battery for 2 days! Managment here said they are busy with other emergencies and didn't take care of it because a  beeping fire alarm is not an emergency. I have bitter experiece of living here and felt trapped. Beware of the management and owner and be prepared to live in this hell if you have signed the lease.

Additionally, the owner is lying here that freezer service was done and no further complaints were made. There were 3 separate request made and everytime someone would come and check but will not fix it so I gave up.<//Text>

<Review>I can give less then zero stars for this apartments. I lived in this community for 1 year and 9 months, they gave me nothing but hard time everytime I have a request. I registered my car for parking in the community when I first moved in to presidio, but after living there for 1year and 7 months, when I had to park my car in the uncovered parking, they towed it accidentally and blamed me that I did not register my car with them. I registered my car and it was in my file 3 months before they towed my car. When I saw my car was missing and started freaking out, they deleted my cars registration from my file (from the two apartments I lived there) and threw the blame on me. For which I had to pay 400$ just to get back my car from the towing company. After I moved out of the apartments, they lost my mail and they keep saying different stories everytime I call them. They lost my California car registration that I was waiting for. Do not even consider staying in such irresposible apartments.<//Review></record>

Today at 4:00am, the smoke alarm beeps drastically only because the battery is low. We had to get up and searched on YouTube to find a way to stop it. But after we tried several times on things like removing the battery, pressing the button for 15s. Nothing helped but it beeps even louder and more frequent. I think inspecting the smoke alarm and changing the battery should be a routine job done regularly especially before giving the apt to new tenants. I felt very bad about their pathetic preventive maintenance.< /text><user_id>107589762430749774708<//user_id><gmapID>0x808fc08c8b7782cd:0x1a7273519c1590d3</gmapID>< Response>

I've been living here for 3 months and I really like it! It's a safe, quiet and clean community. The price is good (I pay $2,200 for a 1 bedroom which is GOOD for the area!) The few issues I've had were resolved in less than 24 hours (our washing machine was really loud so they replaced it with a brand new one, and my neighbor parked over the line and into my parking spot, and they resolved it right away). Apartment searching is aweful, so if you want a place that is clean and close to bart, I suggest Presidio.<//text>

But couple of months after living here, we noticed BED BUGS in one of the rooms in our apartment. I let the office know and the manager just says "bed bugs are all over Fremont" and they seemed to pretty acceptive of the fact that its pretty normal around here or they will blame it on you that you must have gotten it somehow. I should mention here that they did take quick action regarding this issue and will have treatment in the apartment which requires us to pack everything so they can spray and take care of the bed bugs but its just an added stress to deal with all of this.
PLEASE MOVE IN AT YOUR OWN RISK! IF ANYTHING, ATLEAST ASK BEFORE MOVING IN WHETHER THEY HAVE BED BUGS IN THE COMMUNITY AND IF THEY DENY IT, THEY ARE LYING! THEY WILL PROBABLY SAY IT'S ALL OVER FREMONT.
Never had the issue of bed bugs in the apartment that I lived in for 10 years in Fremont prior to moving here.I would probably rate this as my worst experience ever.< /review>< user_id>

After living here for over a year now, we're moving out mainly because of the squeaky floor noise from the apartment above us. I believe this is a common issue across many apartments here.  Other pros and cons below:

Pros:
- Walking distance from Bart
-  Two swimming pools, one of them is a sun room pool
-  Maintenance team available all 7 days

Cons:
- Squeaky floor noise from your upstairs neighbor
- Unplanned water shut downs puts you in embarrassing situations, pray to god you're not in the bathroom during that time :)  This has happened multiple times.
- No centralized air conditioning or heater, the only window mounted air conditioner available  in the living /dining space is so old and will make so much noise that we never turn it on.
- If you're not in first floor then your patio will be really small and most probably the wooden floors there will be in a bad condition.

Overall, if you want to live closer to BART take your chance.< /review>

Worst management I’ve ever seen! They will suddenly hire some third party service and let tenants pay for the service even though it is not specified in the lease.

Stay away if you can coz you will never know this before you sign the lease. Otherwise you will pay for fees you have no idea why they exist.<//text>

Its a place to get immediate copys, supplys IF they stock it. They Treat You Like Your Takeing  Up There Time.( You know the up and down look). ! They don't offer to try and get you what you need, or show you were supply are, small store but who wants to be pointed in THAT direction. I've been in there several times and its been the same service every time.A trip to Eureka will do for me.
Sorry I'm all for supporting small businesses but not one that makes you feel unnecessary.<//text>

So I am hard of hearing, which is why this is three stars instead of one or two, because I admit that I might have heard the wrong question or something. But at the same time, I do remember saying "just one" when asked how many copies, even though six were printed, so perhaps I am not the only one who is hard of hearing? Furthermore, when I saw how many copies were printed and I said again, I only needed one, the person who printed them for me argued with me and told me that they double checked. So once again, maybe I am hard of hearing, maybe they were hard of hearing, I don't know. But perhaps it is not the best idea to have the desk where the copies are made across the room and the person making copies facing away from the customer. I assume there are perfectly reasonable reasons for this. But at the same time, I had to pay for six copies, five of which I have no use for, when I only wanted one. I would like to feel confident in returning to this place, I am a student and with the HSU library closed this is the cheapest option for printing. But if I show up with a 10 page article one day that needs to be printed and they print 60 copies and expect me to pay for all of them... I hope you see my dilemma.</review>

If you are going for notary expect to wait until everyone else is helped regardless of your place in line, number of employees working, or how many groups they get in while you wait.  Also the the oldest woman employee will blatently treat you like you steal while all 3 employees are "to busy to help you".< /text>

<Text>The girls there are nice but unhelpful. Asked several different times if it would cost anything to ship an amazon return and got different answers everytime. Just showed up in person with the box I wanted to ship and the label from amazon in my email. They were nice and had me email the label and they printed it but then they said that would be $1.25 for printing one label on one piece of paper. It would save time to just be straight forward about costs instead of printing something for an exorbitant price then hoping i would pay it since they already created it for me. Thanks but I'll just print at HSU for 4 cents and drop it off somewhere else.  That's insanity and kind of shady. I just didnt appreciate the experience.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>I grew up in Humboldt and came back in August for my father's funeral. I went to McKinleyville Office Supply in the hopes of supporting a local business and fulfilling my father's service related needs (Printing service announcements ect.). I came in to the store 5-10 minutes before the store closed and the young girl behind the counter made a snarky comment about how everyone wanted to come into the store right before it closed. I ignored the comment because I understand having a long day at work. I asked her if they carried any vellum and she said "yes." I then had to ask her where to find it. Instead of taking me to where the vellum was located, she pointed in a general direction. I generally don't mind finding things on my own but I thought for someone in such a hurry to close the store, she would have shown me where it was so the it would expedite me leaving. It turned out they didn't actually have vellum so I left and went to Michael's. I returned the next day to have a picture and quote printed on (proper) vellum. An older man, Im assuming the owner, refused to print on the paper and said that he didn't think his printer would print on it. When I asked if he would be willing to try printing on one sheet, he flat out refused and got angry with me and offered no other alternative. He told me that he was not going to break his $40,000 printer by trying to print on vellum. (You can print on vellum from a home computer. Being out of town, I did not have access to a personal printer other wise, I would have done it myself.) His behavior was absolutely appalling. The woman who was there with him offered to help but I had already lost all interest in supporting this business. This experience was so embarrassing and unprofessional that I am writing this review a month later. I ended up going to Scrapper's Edge in Eureka! The staff was so friendly, they had all different colors of vellum (real vellum) and printed my father's inserts within a few minutes. Needless to say, I will never refer anyone to MOS.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I see a common thread in these reviews...rudeness and poor customer service, in an industry where customers are everything. I'm glad I wasn't the only one, so I won't take it personally, but I also won't be coming back. I too was treated really rudely by this company. I stopped in to inquire about services, get some pricing and place a large order, and either it was too busy or a bad day, but I did not like how I was spoken to by an associate. Why do people work in a service-oriented industry when they hate working with people? Mind-boggling.<//text>< Pictures>

Kind of rude. I came on a Saturday at 2 pm exactly. I was at the door and so was someone else who had already been there a few minutes parked infront of the door trying to get their large package up to the door. The 2 two ladies working had already locked up and were standing at register near the door but wouldn’t look up at us even though I was trying the door.  I askednif they could open for just a minute so I could print a paper one lady responded that the pick up time had already happened for shipping so it didn’t matter and I said I didn’t need to ship anything just to print a paper but they still said no.  The lady that had already been there pushing her package up to door couldn’t believe it as she had been there before 2. I probably won’t be back.</Review>

Have been massively overcharged now three times for UPS shipping via checking the UPS site with exact measurement/weights. Also do not appreciate the banter among the employees after each customer comes and goes, can only wonder what is said about me..done with this local business.</text>

{'time': 1513388939302, 'text': 'Sorry about your experience. We have a small service charge over what UPS charges us which is not the same as what is on their website  since our volume is not very large. I will speak to my staff about their conduct and comments on the sales floor as I agree this is not acceptable.\nRespectfully\nPaul Trepanier\nProprietor'}</Resp>

I have never been treated with such disrespect! I came in today to print out a 8 page document. It printed as 50 page document with blank pages. First they didn't confirm, with Print Preview how many pages it would be and if it was comparable with their software. I was nice and said sorry but I'm not paying for this as on the attracted file I sent it said 8 pages. He got very angry really fast and said, "So I have to eat these charges!" I said well you should have checked and confirmed with me first. Then his coworker confused me with another customer and accused me of giving them the wrong printing files before! I was so shocked by the anger and unprofessionalism of this company.< /review>

<text>= THIEVES = DON'T SHIP YOUR PKG HERE - STOLE GOODS FROM MY SHIPMENT. COOKIES WERE MISSING FROM MY CHRISTMAS SHIPPING - ALL 2 POUNDS. ONLY THE UNDERWEAR & SOCKS WERE IN THE PKG TO MY SON. IT'S TAKEN ME THIS LONG TO CALM DOWN. THIEVES!!!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1535556070882, 'text': "Ms. Darlington,\n\nI am surprised that you did not contact me either in person or by telephone to report that your shipment's contents were missing. We are not thieves. Perhaps the package was opened by the carrier or broke open  during shipment. However, at this late date I would have no way of trying to get a refund from the shipper. I also do not have any shipments logged on my shipping computer under your name. Perhaps it was shipped under another name. Regardless, not contacting me or the store immediately brings concerns as to why. I'm sorry you had a negative experience as we strive to bring top notch service and professionalism to our customers.\n\nRegards,\n\nJ. Paul Trepanier, Proprietor\nMcKinleyville Office Supply"}<//Response>

<Time>1621546511197< /Time><Text>Love this place! I ordered the pink matcha that has rose and beet juice in it and it was perfectly delicious and not overly sweet. I also had the tomato mozzarella flatbread pastry and thought it was tasty and a great savory snack. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, and even a little dog bed for your BFF who wants to lounge with you. It’s kinda tucked into an alley, so park wherever and then make your way down Miller Alley rather than going on union etc.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The place is very cute and the coffee is good but your staff need to drop the attitude. I went Saturday afternoon and there were only 2 other customers waiting. The cashier was very sweet and helpful as it was my first time there. I paid for my drink and moved to the side/back to wait for it to be ready. Another staff says “can i help you with something?” I replied I was waiting to which says “she (the cashier) told you to wait outside”. Luckily, my drink was ready so I left. Sorry Im partially deaf and didnt know I was supposed to wait outside. Between  the partition, masks and music playing its a wonder anyone can hear anything. I won’t be going back.<//review>< Pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>My husband and I wanted to try a few new places in the Pasadena area, and while walking around, we came across a sign on the Main Street, saying there were coffee and plants in the back. We followed the sign a little back patio, and came across hands-down the cutest coffee shop I have ever seen. We are both crazy coffee nuts, and we have travelled the world (Germany, Armenia, Dubai, Greece, several states) looking for great coffee shops. This place easily makes the top 5 list. Easily.

I’m not a fan of non dairy options, so when the owner, AC, told us everything was dairy free, I was worried I wouldn’t like the taste. He recommended trying oat milk, because it’s the closest to dairy options. My husband got a cappuccino with almond milk, and I got myself an oat milk 24k chocolate latte.

The drinks are delicious. Seriously delicious. I could not tell that my drink was missing dairy.

We also bought a cute little Coffee & Plants pin, something to take home, and I wanted to spend more money in the cafe.

I cannot begin to explain how cute this place is. It’s a little tight, and finding parking is a pain, but once you’re inside it’s hard to want to leave. Highly recommend and I’ll definitely be back.

<Review>Good coffee spot that's probably way better when itt's not covid. The drinks were great but the atmosphere of the shop and the instagrammableness of the drinks are probably much more appealing than the flavors of the drinks themselves.

They had some pretty unique coffee drinks with gold, lavendar, and other flavors but they seemed a bit overpriced for a take out drink. Came to support the business during the hard time and try something new but can't wait to be able to sit down outside in the patio and hang out with friends.

Parking really isn't great in the area, but there's a garage with one hour free near the apple store around the corner and metered street parking on side streets.

Can't wait to try this place again soon!< /Review>< pictures>

I've really enjoyed my visits to Coffee+Plants.  The specialty drinks are really fun. My favorite is the Lavender Latte (blue one in the pic).   As a coffee lover, I also appreciate a really great cup of black coffee too.  Their blend is one of the best I've tried and should not be missed.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>This is the sort of cafe where you'll spend the first 30 seconds deciding whether to look around or order first.
Definitely order first. The plants will still be there.

I hadn't actually intended to go here. I was on my way to somewhere else.
But... coffee? Plus plants? And everything is plant based?
Delicious cappuccinos and lattes.
'Pretty fly for a cacti.'
Drinkable gold.

This place is amazing. I had entirely too much caffeine.</Text><time>1583958795391< /time><username>Scott Dee<//username>< Pictures>

I wouldn’t go back, coffee it’s not amazing and I think it’s overpriced... plus if the place it’s called coffee and plants it would be very nice to have more plants or flowers around. And not so many plastic ones. Just an idea.< /Review>

<Review>This place is amazing, such unique lattes I've never heard of!  I tried the superfood latte and not exaggerating it was the best thing I've ever tasted.  I'll definitely be coming back to try the Rose and Lavender lattes.  Amazing decor inside, very cozy and the staff was really nice.  Would for sure recommend.</Review>< GmapID>

This place was aesthetically pleasing. I was really excited to try their blue latte based on pictures of other reviews. I ordered it with oat milk and even though it was really pretty to look at, taste wise it disappointed me. The taste was really bland and not worth my money. Beware this drink is non-caffeniated so that is also another strike for me. I would have rated this place higher if it wasn't for the owner's sarcasm. My order had already been placed and he approached us asking if we were from Pasadena etc. As we were talking I noticed they had stamp cards at my reach, which are usually offered to the customer when they make a purchase. I simply asked if he could stamp a card so I could come back and he replied very rude "No" in a very sassy way....I was shocked and replied why not? In my head I thought am I missing something? It took him a few seconds for him to say "I mean I could have refused you know?" Then he went on saying imagine if I had refused? And I understood he was probably joking but I don't understand why an owner of a new small business would joke around like that with new customers on their first interaction with the place....I could have definitely felt very offended and ask for my money back. Which I didn't but that's the reason I won't be returning to this place. Even aside from the whole owner to customer interaction, the taste of the latte is not worth me going back. I would much rather go to other coffee places like Jameson Brown  Coffee Roasters or Copa Vida their lattes are perfection.</review>

Went here last week and the woman that was working here was so rude and no personality. I even called ahead of time to see what matcha they used and she was even rude on the phone. The matcha is good quality but I will not be going here if I'm gonna get bad service.< /text>

My sister (my wedding planner ) placed an order for cupcakes for our wedding. She was told she must communicate through email to order so after an exchange of emails she believed we were confirmed to pick up cupcakes for Friday , May 21. My fiancé arrived at the shop to pick up the order and was told our order was never confirmed (not our fault when we have emails proving so). The owner proceeded to get an attitude with my fiancé and raised his voice at him, instead of apologizing for the error. They thankfully were able to put an order together and offered a discount . However , do to this owners attitude and manner In which he conducted himself I will NEVER step foot in this bakery again. He may provide quality cakes , but he needs to learn better customer service skills !<//Text>

So so good! Frank did the cake and cupcakes from my wedding in January and they were fantastic (food and service). Everyone at the bakery is friendly and helpful. There are entirely too many actually good flavors to chose from that it was tough to narrow it down, which is why we did mini cupcakes so we could have more variety. If their pumpkin cake had been in season I would have picked it, but we went with the raspberry champagne and lemon for the main cake, then lemon, chocolate, cheesecake, and I believe carrot cake for the cupcakes. The actual decoration of the cake was better than even my imagination, and everyone was raving about it afterward. It was so good that we are gonna get a small replica for our first anniversary!< /text>

We were searching for a place to get our wedding cake. I even went to a wedding expo. Our first tasting as a couple was here. We were super excited to see/try all the options. We ended up with carrot cake w/cream cheese frosting , chocolate cake w/chocolate ganache and vanilla butter cream, and lastly lemon cake with raspberry filling w/lemon butter cream. Super impressed with the end result. The staff was super friendly and delivered a perfect cake with a finished flower look/my personal cake topper.
If i remember correctly, they also offer a free mini cake on your first anniversary. I hope this is true! (maybe I'll get a confirmation of this)
End story: definitely recommend</Review>

Frank Vilt's Cakes is the best bakery that you MUST go to. Everything they make is so delicious! They did a dessert bar for my wedding a few weeks ago and I still have guests to this day gushing about how good the desserts were. Couldn't recommend this place more!<//text>

his cupcakes are incomparable.  BELIEVE me I have tried EVERY cupcake store I know of between Eugene Oregon and the bay area . .  .the man is an artist !  they are not ONLY beautiful but incredibly sublimely delectable.    ALSO - most WEDDINGS I've been to - you know how it is - you see the cake -you have high hopes it will taste as good as it looks - his are the ONLY cakes that did NOT  disappoint . and I've been to A LOT of weddings .<//Review>

Frank and his helpers make some pretty amazing cupcakes with unique flavors.  My wife and I used Frank Vilt's Cakes to bake for our wedding and we were not disappointed.  We used mini cupcakes and mini cheesecakes for the guests, and a small 6" cutting cake for us.  All the cheesecakes and cupcakes were excellent (peanut butter and jelly cupcakes are amazing!!!), and the cutting cake was really good, too.  Frank Vilt's was open to custom flavors, and has rotating flavors in their glass case at the store which we tried numerous times prior to our wedding; great for helping us select all our flavors.  Delivery and placement of all our baked goods was done very nicely and on time.  Professional service, great flavor, high quality, and reasonable pricing.  I would highly recommend this place.< /review>

<Review>HAD to give one star in order to type a review - Frank doesn’t deserve ANY stars.
Short story long... Weeks in advance my fiancé and I made an appt. for a cake tasting in order to know exactly what we wanted - cake, frosting, and filling for our special wedding day. Excitedly we decided on 2 layers. The top layer (my choice) a chocolate cake with champagne buttercream and raspberry filling. The bottom layer (his choice) champagne cake, chocolate buttercream, and cheesecake filling. Our wedding date planned for 2.22.2020. It’s both our second wedding and we had never done this before. We placed our order, planned to pick it up at 10am since we didn’t need it delivered, paid in full even with a tip. Fast forward to the wedding day... my fiancé got there around 1005 for pick up... the cake wasn’t done and Frank himself was confused as to why he was even there. Scrambling to find the order (which was never located) another girl had it on her phone. ‘Fire up the ovens’ Frank said. He said he would have it delivered by 3, and it was. Frank should have delivered it himself but, another girl did the delivery.  Crisis avoided or so we thought. Ceremony, dinner, dancing, first dance, laughter... time to cut the cake - Photographer ready... Sigh, it was WRONG. Frank Vilts made the whole cake chocolate cake, champagne buttercream and raspberry filling. No second layer for my husband!!! So, not only did they mess up once (which was forgiven) they did it twice. It’s amazing to me how this can happen. Such a special time in someone’s life and it is taken from them. I had always dreamed of this and even keeping some of the cake and freezing it until our first anniversary and enjoying it as another celebration. As silly as it seems, that was taken away from us too! Enough said!< /Review>< Name>

Blown away by the amazing flavor of the cake and cupcakes made by this bakery for my friends birthday! The design was immaculate and I cannot get over how amazing it tasted, it was the death by chocolate cake and red velvet cupcakes. I look forward to trying more flavors from this bakery!</Text>

Saturday morning I pick up cupcakes for my grandchildern while we color Easter eggs.
The Cupcakes were dry and tasteless.
Lately very disappointed with Frank's it's been going down hill with his products making mistakes especially with his staff.< /Text>

During a recent stay at my parens’ house in El Dorado Hills, I ended up exhausting my list of new cupcake stores nearby to try so ventured a bit farther up Highway 50 to check this one out.  The cupcakes were generously portioned and quite tasty - buttercream frosting and interesting flavors like Pistachio Cream, Butterfinger, and Boston Creme Pie.  I brought home a tray of them to share with the family and they were completely devoured in just over 24 hours (pretty fast considering how large these cupcakes were!)< /Text>

Although Garcías garage was busy, Eddie was able to squeeze in an alignment for my truck. I was told it was going to be done towards the end of the day. I was ok with that knowing he was willing to help me out by doing it even though he was busy. I got to the shop close to closing hours and once the truck work was complete, to my surprise he even took the time to point out a radius arm that needs replacement. You would think that after closing time they would want to rush things to go home, but not with these guys. Eddie and his technicians took the time to work on my truck and explain what I needed. Overall took care of me as a customer. Thank you Garcías garage!<//review>

Today was my first time going there and I will definitely be returning for any car repairs in the future. Eddie was absolutely amazing and very helpful. He took care of my needs very quickly and made sure to explain everything fully. I was very impressed on the short amount of time it took to service my car and would recommend this place to anyone after my experience today.<//Text>

Quick and painless. I went in and was happy to find a mechanic that wasn't covered in oil. He had one customer/vehicle before me so I waited about 20-30 mins.< /Review>

Always great service, prices very fair. Eddie is very honest, he doesn't do anything to your car that it doesn't need, just to make money. Highly recommended.</review>

<time>1604859912358</time><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I came in to get a Smog Check... Eddie is a great honest and reputable. With a high level of integrity. They do suspension brakes alignments smog checks. As I was waiting in line to get written up for a smog check, the gentleman took a phone call, somebody on the other line was asking for engine Diagnostics, Eddie gracefully told them I don't do that work here. And unselfishly referred him to two shops in town, and a assured that caller there honest people.
My first time here. I'm impressed. I found my new auto shop in Perris. Go see Eddie. Mom and Pop Shop when you get quality Care and you are not a dollar sign. Thanks Eddie. Find out what customer service is all about.<//review>< pictures>

They have a nice display of affordable furniture.  They have very little of it in stock and refuse to sell floor models.  Waste of time to go there.<//text>

< Review>
Hit or miss Went yesterday and found lots of great household items and gifts
Today the line was so huge with lethargic employees Waited for about five minutes, then they said they formed one line and put me at the back of it I had to give up and leave Nothing worth a half hour to pay for and being treated like cattle</Review>

<Text>Cheap items at cheap prices. My experience has mainly fallen under the "you get what you pay for category;" I've found I'd prefer to spend more initially on quality items than to have to visit discount stores on a more frequent basis.</Text>< pics>

The most unsanitary retail store I have been in so far in my town, Watsonville  for covid-19. People shopping with no mask or not wearing properly. Check out-no disinfecting after each customer e.g., wiping down counters, credit card payment equipment, no one disinfecting carts, hand baskets etc. A table when entering with a bottle of spray foam (don't know what it was and a large roll of rest room brown hand paper towels on a large continuous roll.
In my county, Watsonville rates the highest covid 19 positives. Couldn't wait to get out to my car and squeeze my hand sanitizer. They did have a small make shift plexi glass shield for the checker but didn't cover much between you and that person, very narrow and looked to be portable as to move around. UGH!!! Hope I don't get infected. Stay Home!!!! Way more safe.< /Text>

<text>When I got to the store at 8:48pm, after I was forced to enter through the out door, an employee shouted "you got ten minutes ". I found what I needed and was out in 8 minutes,  at 8:56pm.  Another customer came at that time, and the employee denied her entrance to the store.    When I was quickly grabbing items I needed, another employee came up to me and reminded me it was almost their closing time. It looks like they dont pay their employees to close.<//text>< pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I really like Big Lots Store because they have some items that I can't get anywhere else for the same price! Their prices are hard to beat, so I love going to Big Lots. Plus, they're really branching out with different food items! You can get some really cool edibles there, and even ORGANICS, for cheap! Also... Big Lots. Sells. MAKEUP!!! Yes, makeup! Also really well priced. Sometimes you can find really good quality cosmetics there, brands like Revlon, Almay, Cover Girl, L'Oreal, etc. Go check it out!</review>< Pics>
