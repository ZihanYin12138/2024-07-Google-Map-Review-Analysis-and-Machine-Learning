<text>We were actually looking for s Mexican restraunt that was open. We were heading to another place with good reviews. But we passed by this place. It smelled so so good from outside. We followed delicious smell back to this place. Found very friendly staff. Clean indoor and cool covered shady outdoor dining. Plus most amazing delicious food and surprisingly not crowded. We will definitely be back...often!!!< /text>< GmapID>

Another diamond in the rough. It was small but cozy. Great staff, they got me all the extras I asked for, extra napkins, salsa for chips and pico de gio.  Waitress recommended the steak Fajita salad and it was exactly what I needed.

Washed it down with the bucket sized cup of Pepsi finished up the salsa and chips.

Place is simple and the food is good. I will definitely try to make it back here in the future. Place I delivered was literally across the street so very convenient.

Only glitch and not a big deal is washroom can only be accessed from outside.
LOL!  But it was clean, well stocked and didn't stink and no plumbing issues.<//text>

<text>A friend recommended Teresa's, proclaiming they have the best Chile Verde he's ever had.  I was skeptical, but this little restaurant in the middle of Wasco, California is amazing.  The Chile Verde burrito was simple, but sublime!  Tender, well cooked meat, rice and refried beans from scratch.  You can't go wrong!  I also took home Carne Asada burritos, and my wife and daughter loved them.  They are also super nice!  So good.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

I had the chili verde which was good, but careful it's on the spicy side. My friend had the burrito supreme and it was so greasy it continuously dripped all over his hands. Probably 1/8 cup of drippings came out. He couldn't finish it.

Also, they charge for refills on everything except tea. Yep, they can't spare 1/10 of a cent on more soda.</Text>

What an incredible gem this place is!
Super friendly staff, great service and the food! Yum!
We had the fish and shrimp tacos and they were amazing! And the salsa is fresh homemade with nice spicy kick.
Highly recommend this little hideaway</Text>

I've been there before and it was awesome. On this visit I didn't think it was that great! I ordered cheese enchiladas and their rice and the rice wasn't as great as before. The grain was long before, now it was all tiny that you couldn't see the rice. It was weak. I only ordered cheese enchiladas and got charged like I had ordered beef. The horchata water wasn't great as well. It was weak. It had more water than rice. I was very dissapointed on this visit. I hope it's better next time!</review>

<review>This place was recommended by the front desk clerk at the Best Western. I had the pork Chile Verde based on another Google user's review, and it was excellent, with deep rich flavors. Even the rice was exceptional. The service was speedy and friendly. Not fancy, just good hone style Mexican cooking.< /review><Date>1416373558124</Date><pics>None< /pics><rating>5<//rating>< gmapID>

<text>I grew up on the food, so almost required to like it. There's is usually only one over worked waitress, so service is never the best. If you have time to wait though, the asada tacos are fantastic!  Chile Verde is great too if you like it HOT!< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Great selection of food but there is the occasional off-meal. Biggest problem is the plates/bowls. They are often not washed completely<//text>

<Text>Pretty decent dining hall, probably my favorite on campus. Unfortunately not very consistent in quality from day to day. Also very expensive for non-students.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<resp>None</resp><Review>All of the food is super healthy and the layout is weird. There's one section (of real food) that's actually good, one section that's sort of okay, one section that looks good but is fake food, and then the dessert section is great (there's a person that will make you a crepe). The atmosphere seems nice but it can be hard to section off a part of the table if you're hoping to have a more private meal.

Oh and the chandeliers are plastic.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<time>1567542197344<//time><text>Offers the same type of food almost every single week. They rotate what they make, so there’s definitely not much of a variety. I had mexican style for at least four days in a week. They need to switch around and use other ingredients instead of ground beef, ground chicken, flour/corn tortilla and develop their menu. It's pretty rare to eat good quality food from this dining hall.<//text><pics>None< /pics></record>

I had an appointment. I showed up about 30 minutes early. Instead of making me wait, they took my truck immediately. Even though they have a full day, they got me finished before the time of my actual appointment.
Great job guys. Very kind and professional. Each of the mechanics that I ran into were very nice and helpful...

I love the fact that the owner actually reads the reviews. Great job guys. Keep it up. Will be back if I have the need... 👍</Review>

They took my car in at the right time, told me it would be one hour for my oil change and they were correct.  The waiting room was very clean and they even had coffee, tea or hot cocoa and wrapped snacks. I will definitely be going back to this place of business.< /Review>

Alot of place want to try and tell you to spend the max amount of money for what needs to be done or waste your time with this and that, they were straight up and very thorough with everything that had to be done now and what could wait until later. They sent me a link to the entire test to see pictures and everything and walked me through all my questions and didn't make me feel stupid or rushed even though they were extremely busy. They even gave me a ride home. 100% recommend and I will be back. Thanks again.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I’ve been coming here for 3 years, 3 different vehicles worked on. Great quality every time, and really sweet employees. Overall a super stand-up place to trust with your vehicle. They went above and beyond to make sure my car could be finished in time, as I was going out of town this week I ran into car trouble. Will always come back here!< /review>< username>

These guys are awesome I drive from Redding to get my car serviced because they know what they're doing ,they are honest whether they make money from you or not they will tell you the truth about your car truck or whatever you bring. They are efficient they obviously care about their customers, I have been to a lot of different mechanics in my lifetime and these guys I trust I will recommend them to anyone. They send you pictures with diagnosis, and explain the issues, health,  and repairs your vehicle needs so you can clearly see and understand what work needs to be done!! I am huge on reviews because us customers have to rely on them, its our hard money we don't want to waste it! Good job Anderson automotive!!<//Text>

I am very happy with the service!  I got my oil changed and they also did a 45 point inspection as part of the service.  They take photos of the areas they inspect and text you a link to view them and keep them for your records.  They were friendly, thorough, and professional.  I highly recommend them! 😃< /Text>

I will definitely recommend Anderson Automotive to everyone I know as I believe I finally found my automotive repair home.

Anderson auto went over and beyond , our breaks went out in a car we bought in Sept they did. Full inspection took photos and explained everything to us verbally and in writing. They even lent us a lender car while our car was being repaired. We will recommend Anderson Auto to our friends , family and people we don't know as well. Thank you for everything.<//Review>

I got a smog check.  $45, seemed like a good price.  I was very early (forgot to change my truck clock for daylight savings... lol) they still did the check and I didn't have to wait!  Super nice people.</text>

Google for the best rated auto repair near me since we just moved to the area. From the first friendly conversation to the pick up of my repaired car, Brandy and Brandon were professional, friendly and easy to work with. The mechanic ( sorry forgot his name) took me out and showed me the problems , explained  , advised and Never pressured me.
I recommend Anderson Auto.</Review>

I mean wow.  I just got an oil change, they gave away tons of free oil and labor on Veterans Day 2020, but I got to meet and talk with a lot of the employees.  You know somewhere does amazing work when then have amazing employees.  Everyone was super easy to talk to.  Overhearing them talk to customers with issues, they were genuine and worked had to make sure they were happy.   While I only came in for the oil change and hope I don’t have auto trouble I’m the coming days, I know now I have a place to go if I do.  Thank you Anderson Auto.  You all are wonderful.  Thank you for being people worth serving your country for.< /Text>

< Review>
I needed some warranty work done so I called Anderson's to see if they could help me out so I didn't have to go to the dealership. Since I have an extended warranty through a third party they were able to help me out! I was able to get small regular maintenance items done at the same time. They didn't try to upsell me or push unnecessary work. Very friendly and professional staff!

Brandon, at the front desk, was very friendly and was able to process my paperwork quickly with no wait.

Definitely would reccomend Anderson Automotive!</Review>

Low beams for headlights went out(both). Back passenger light wouldn't go off, thought it was an electrical problem so took it into the shop and had them take a look. Granddaughter, 3yrs old, had turned a nob witch kept that light on. Both low beam bulbs went out at same time.  Thanks to all of you and God bless.  🤗💖👍🏻🙏< /text>

Branden the service advisor is professional and knows his stuff, and the owners Nick and Nicole are great people who have a passion for their business. They also have techs with experience and you can have confidence they’ll take care of you properly and honestly!< /Review>

New to area, had sensor light come on. Dropped by early in the morning without an appointment and they were able to get vehicle in to look at and take care of. Great staff, pleasant waiting area and clean shop. Love the follow-up from them a week later to make sure everything is running fine. Great experience.< /text>

Rolled into the shop around 3:30 as the rear wheel bearing kicked the bucket.  We had about 700 miles to go to get home and thought we might have to spend the night waiting for repairs.  Fortunately we were back on the road before 5pm.
Can’t thank you all enough!  Especially the mechanic who was totally familiar with my vehicle having owned the same one!

Thank you one and all< /review>

< review>
I chose going to Anderson Automotive as they were local, I like to
support small, home town businesses and they had a lot of good reviews
on Google. Now I find them as flat out LIES!

They charged me $120 an hour when the sign on the wall stated $109.56,
this in my opinion is not good business.

Marking up needed parts astronomically is sheer robbery, I was charged
$505.23 for a new alternator, directly from Ford they are only $238.
They charged me $400.90 for front wheel bearings and seals. Again from
Ford they only $53.44 (each). These costs were not cleared ahead of
completion, given the high cost of parts I feel this is something that
should have gotten approval.

I asked ahead of time for my faulty parts as so I could return them,
they were not in the car when I picked it and have yet to be located,
is a poor business practice.

When I picked up the car the check engine light was still on I
returned immediately for them to clear the code and was told that if it
appeared again to come back next week, it was only able to go a short
before coming back on.

Not completing the needed repairs and being told to just drive the car
over the weekend seems very unprofessional.  I am hoping to get this
resolved in short time.

I will NEVER do business with Anderson Automotive again and
will tell my friends and family NOT to do business either.</review>

<response>{'time': 1576426561229, 'text': 'Hi this is Nick the owner of Anderson Automotive, I generally always try to find what we could have done to prevent 1 star reviews (I am a huge proponent of self accountability) as we obviously try our best to get a 5 not only for our reputation, but for my own peace of mind, I take great pride in what we do and it really disappoints me when someone leaves unhappy. First, let me start off by saying the vehicle came in with a check engine light code for low voltage and the alternator that you had installed 6 months earlier had failed, we had one of our technicians do the testing necessary to diagnose the alternator problem and he found it was not charging and causing the check engine light. We also noted your left front wheel bearing making noise. That is when we called you and informed you of everything going on (the next day from you dropping it off at 8:32am according to our records) and gave you a price on everything in which you approved, which included both front wheel bearings and a quality alternator, we would NEVER  do repairs to a vehicle without prior authorization from the vehicles owner, if the bill goes up by $20 from what we quoted, we call. It is not our vehicle or our money so we do not ever make that decision. Also it is a California LAW. I’m unsure of why you claim we did anything without your authorization, because not only do I have documentation (date,time,who we talked to etc) you in your own review above,claim you asked for your parts back after completion of repairs ahead of time, I’m unsure how you can ask for parts to be returned on a repair you did not authorize. When you picked the vehicle up we did drop the ball on returning your alternator because there is a “core” which means we need to return it to the supplier, my technician accidentally returned the core, which was 100% our mistake which is why I refunded you the complete price of the alternator($505) As far as the check engine light upon pickup, because the alternator was not charging we could not see the other underlying codes in the system, you had an unrelated oxygen sensor code, but being that as I stated I really do not like to have anyone leave unsatisfied we replaced your front oxygen sensor completely free of charge to you. Again I’m sorry you are dissatisfied with us, and if I can do anything else, please let me know\n\nNick Jones\n365-6838\nNick@andersonsmog.com'}< /response>< gmapID>

<Review>They were friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and expedient. I don't believe they made any profit from the "synthetic oil change" offer which I received in the mail, but they have definitely gained a new customer.
I was informed of a couple brewing issues relating to my older Subaru which I appreciated being informed of before getting too much worse.
Anderson Automotive is reasonably and fairly priced, and I was told they warranty everything  for a generous period of time (I can't state the exact cuz I don't want to misquote them), and they provide one of their loaner cars if yours will be in the shop for an extended time.
I was a first-time customer and was very pleased with their services.  I will become a regular customer from here on out!<//Review>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1578965007258, 'text': "Hi Sarah this is Nick, Im sorry you feel this way about your visit here. ID love to chat with you about this to better explain/understand what happened and take care of any issues you may have. It seems last we talked you were having a leaking issue and we explained if it was something we did we would take care of it under our 3 year 36000 mile warranty, but we never received anymore info. We did indeed just replace the pump on the Honda for 639 dollars including labor and diagnostics, because of your concern over price and the fact that you were from out of the area and it was New Year’s Eve we did try and reuse your reservoir, unfortunately it did need replacing like we originally recommended which is why we towed the vehicle back to our shop and I personally stayed late, sourced a reservoir(made a special trip to get it) and installed it so you could leave that day around 7pm. We have a full digital inspection of your vehicle with all the issues we found and would be glad to go over it with you. Informing you of issues on your vehicle can sometimes be alarming but knowing you are from out of town and didn’t have time for anything other than what we did, I’m not sure how informing you of the issues with your vehicle could be construed as “dishonest” These hondas are very common for bad engine mounts and need to be checked properly, the technician that worked on your vehicle worked in a honda dealer for over 15 years and although we are all human Im very confident in his abilities. I'm sad to hear this is how you felt but I would be glad to stand behind anything we did, and or recommended.

I have to say this is the most dishonest place I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I was visiting from Utah and my power steering had stopped working. First of all, they quoted me 1400$ for a new power steering pump. First of all, I think that it's very unethical to put a new part on a 16 year old vehicle. Then they said that for a refurbished part would be 800$: the same price as the dealer. They said that they would change the power steering pump, the low pressure hose, and the reservoir. Turns out all they did was change the power steering pump because everything else was "fine." I picked it up and it started leaking immediately.  The nice thing they did was tow it from where it was and replace the reservoir for free so I could have it to drive back home before the holiday. That seemed to work!!! Except that it didn't. As soon as I got home it started leaking all over the driveway!!!  They had also diagnosed a myriad of problems including "broken" motor mounts, a SEVERE oil leak, and a low battery. All of these thing we're confirmed as being COMPLETELY UNTRUE!!!!!!
I feel completely swindled by them!!!
Sorry Nick, you and your guys need to practise doing the job right the first time, stop overcharging, and stop lying to your customers!</text>

<Review>I had my car fixed here and it was a pretty major overhaul. They were super friendly and even allowed me to use a loaner car for the week or so that it took to get it back up and running!! THEN twice I’ve had some little repair since that needed to be done and they got right on it while I waited and I was on my way!! I will never take my vehicle to another shop again and recommend Nick, Ryan and the other guys to anyone that has any repairs that need to be done!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

No doubt in my mind they are the best shop in town. Super friendly and helpful staff. I only went here due to my normal mechanic being way too busy and honestly glad it happened. This is my new shop for sure.< /text>

Exceptional service. Everyone there was great. Made me feel very welcome the minute I walked in the door.
That was indeed the fastest smog check my "Sammy Silverado" had ever gone through. I will most definitely be a repeat customer.  Highly recommend!< /text>

Useless Yelp never posted my review!! I love Anderson Automotive, because I worked and saved VERY hard to get my newer (used) car, and I feel like they care about keeping it in good shape as much as I do. I HIGHLY recommend them for any used car purchase inspections. They did mine after my purchase through Carvana, they caught things that the Carvana inspectors missed. They then worked with the Carvana service team to get my repair done. They check in with me to make sure my car is still running well, and everything is good. Unlike some shops, they don't upsell me on things. They straight advised me on what standard maintenance I had to do now (Carvana doesn't do presale maintenance), and what can wait until later. And the pricing...off the chart amazing!! They are a fraction of what other shops have charged me.</text>

<text>First met Nick when we moved up from the Bay Area in June of 2015. We have had him service our 2 vehicles and keep them on the road for us. Super great guy and have recommended him to many of our new friends in the area. He is honest and his prices are amazing. He will only tell you what needs to be fixed and doesn't try to get you to fix something that is not needed. He stands behind his warranties and I can leave his shop and know I am not being taken advantage of. I trust him. I have lots of stories with my experience with Anderson Automotive and they have all been good experiences. Nick you are the best!</text>< Time>

<time>1569910671304</time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I just purchased a used vehicle and took it to Anderson Automotive to have them go through it with a fine tooth comb and identify any issues. They were booked up but squeezed me in at the beginning of the next week. My back brakes were shot (I knew this coming in) so I had them replace the rear brakes and rotors. The engine was making a popping sound and they found out it was just a loose bolt. It also needed an oil change, engine air filter, new wipers (replaced them with Rain-X ones) and it had a front differential axel leak. The big issue was a broken motor mount, which they fixed. They quoted $120 up front for a test drive & they did a 45 point inspection free. It identified these issues as well as upcoming Maintenance needs. They sent me the inspection report (with pictures) and I had them perform most of the repairs & maintenance. The final total came in a little under their updated quote and they gave me discounts from two coupons and a discount for paying in cash. The vehicle sounds and runs so much better now. They are very informative, drove me home and picked me back up when it was done in a very nice van (they have a loaner cars too, if needed).
Overall, they run their shop like a dealership shop but with the costs of a little ma & pa shop. I would recommend them to anyone that needs to get their vehicle fixed or maintained over taking it to your dealership.< /review>< pics>

This was my first time going to this shop as I am new to the area. I was quite apprehensive after being burned a couple of times at some other places in the Bay area.
These guys made me feel at ease and are very professional, social, respectful and take the time to really explain things in layman
terms. The inspections are documented online and the items
inspected are photographed to show you what they see. They also told me some things that needed to be
addressed in the future for repairs as well. Needless to say,
I was very impressed and will be  returning customer.<//Text>

The service writer Ryan was extremely helpful and friendly. The waiting area is very family/kid friendly. My car was returned to me with everything I needed done in a timely manner and my seat was even moved back to where I had it (I’m short 😉). Will be taking all our car and truck’s service needs back to Anderson Automotive!</text>

I remember.now. This auto shop didn't sell car but repaired them. I remember now because they had an elderly woman I am friends with bring her car in 3 different times for smog and they kept falling it at 85 dallars a pop. I brought her car to a shop I know in redding and it passed the first time. I told them what had been going on to which they said strange we didn't see anything wrong.< /Review>

Extremely friendly service. Nick and Ryan enjoy their jobs and make sure your vehicle gets everything that is needed for safe and reliable performance. Constant updates where very helpful as well. Nick stayed a bit later than closing just so I could have my vehicle for work the next day.</Review>

These guys are top notch!  Hands down the best automotive shop I've ever experienced!  I especially liked that my vehicle inspection report was sent to me electronically via text and included photos to support their repair recommendations.  I have tried out numerous shops since I moved to Shasta County 15 years ago and I can honestly say my search is over.  I will be having all my vehicle's repairs and maintenance done here!!</Review>

{'time': 1553177179208, 'text': 'Hi Dan, this is Nick the owner I was the one who talked to your daughters boyfriend on the phone. The shift cable had popped off due to the shift lever on the transmission being rusted nearly in half and the bushing in the cable being worn from the rust(we sent you pictures of this concern) Under normal operation shift cables do not pop off. The reason we had the Jeep Liberty for a week was due to availability of the shift cable, and lever through Chrysler. Unfortunately due to the large amount of rust on the Jeep we encountered issues in the very beginning steps of replacing both the shift cable and the lever it attached too.  Which is why I called you before we got into a situation that we could not come back from. I know this may not be pleasant but your Jeep had serious rust issues and unfortunately it made the job that much more labor intensive. We gave you the option of not going forward with the repair and not owing anything due to the unforeseen circumstances. And also provided a free oil change for the hassle. I apologize this repair did not go as planned and I really wish there was something we could do. Sorry again and if you have any questions give me a call at 530-365-6838.UPDATE -glad we could chat on the phone and I hope after talking you had a better understanding of what transpired. Thanks'}< /Resp>

<Text>What a great experience. I worried about finding an honest and affordable mechanic, and am so happy I found Anderson Automotive. Not only did they not try to "sell" me on work that didn't need to be done, they took pictures of what did need to be done and provided detailed information on each item.  They were able to squeeze me in the morning I called, and my car was fixed in a matter of hours. A big thank you to Nick and his team!</Text><username>M Pipich<//username>< pictures>

<text>These guys are great.  My family and I were stranded on I-5, and had the car towed here after reading the reviews.  We left the car there on a Sunday, continued on our trip in a rental, communicated via phone with the shop, and picked it up on the way back through town a week later.  They were super professional, prompt, knowledgeable, and nice guys on top of all that.  Price seemed pretty reasonable given the major repairs involved.  Highly recommended!</text>< userid>

They got me in on time and out in less time then they said. The staff was polite (as usual), and the price was what they said it would be. This is the only shop that has never made me feel like I am being taken advantage of. I will continue to take my vehicle there as long as I am living in Shasta County!!!

I was worried about finding another trustworthy mechanic, by a reference I went down and had some work done and now I have a new auto shop I'm confident and comfortable with and trust. Anderson Automotive has another happy customer.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Best place to go for good honest service and repairs. Nick and his crew are always highly knoweledgable and very helpful. I love how they send updates on the progress of your repair work. Very fair pricing and a shop you can trust. Worth the short drive to Anderson.<//review>

<Review>I came in with a check engine light, on my VW. Unfortunately, they don't work on VWs. However, Ryan offered to check the code on my engine light, helped me diagnose the simple issue (a broken seal on my gas cap), and told me how to fix it myself. I came back five minutes later and he cleared the code for me. Didnt charge me a penny. Excellent service.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I was able to use the website to text in my request and set the appointment. The smog price was the lowest we found. My car was done quickly. They didnt give me an expensive list of things that needed to be fixed.  And they texted me a link to my car's profile showing actual pictures they took of my car while they were working on it! That makes it super easy for anything else we need to have done because now they have a record of the car< /Text>< pics>

<review>Tried to scam me. Told me i needed 4 new wheel bearings because one was bad which is not true. Wanted $3000 and tried to tell me it wasnt safe to drive. Went to 2 different Les Schwabs and they both told me it was only one and it was fine to drive, it was also much much cheaper. Also wanted $200 to install a new abs sensor which is $13 online and is one screw. Took me 5 minutes to do myself.

I can assure you we would never scam anyone, our #1 goal is transparency and honesty. Generally we recommend wheel bearings in pairs because they have both seen the same conditions and miles, and through experience we have found they tend to fail simultaneously.I cannot seem to find a record but would love to chat about how we could make your experience with us better or make this one right.

< review>
My girlfriend took her van here to have it smogged. Piece of vacume hose was cracked, told her it was a dealer part. She calls the dealer, forwards me an email and from what we were told,  we assume the part was indeed a dealer only part. Charged her $80 bucks to replace $5 bucks worth of vacume line. Hours after she leaves there the shift linkage bushing mysteriously pops off and she is stranded. So I ended up paying $80 for a $5 chunk of vacume hose, plus I get to replace the linkage bushing ($30 shipped) and had to leave work early.
They justified the $80 to both her and I, by saying it was in a tight spot around the back of the engine. Then when I get the call she is stranded, I find that the hose isn't in a tight spot. It is right on top of the motor. She called to ask about the shift linkage and they change thier story, now they say the hose was right on top of the engine and they were no where near the shift linkage. They flat out lied to gouge my lady, then lie to get out of fixing something they broke. Didn't care if thier lies contradicted one another, because at that point they had got her money, and my bet is they were trying to get her for more on the shift linkage.<//review>

{'time': 1545109599252, 'text': 'Hey Caleb this is Nick the owner, I was the one who performed the smog check on the van, I know Amanda has been coming here for some time and I would hope that she would know we are in no way “gouging” as we have never done to her before over the many services we have performed. The evaporative emissions purge line was broken on top of the motor, which we did replace with bulk vacuum line,the 80 dollars included the repairs, the initial smog and the resmog after the repair, I am unsure of why you had issues with the shifter linkage after the smog, as the line is no where near the shift linkage. We have no problem taking care of anything if we caused an issue, and if you truly feel wronged I have no problem refunding you. I have no intention of “price gouging” anyone. Unfortunately the California smog program is not always customer friendly. Like I said I truly apologize if you feel wronged. If you have any further questions give me a call at 365-6838 thanks'}< /response>

< Review>
My husband and I recently took our van to Anderson Automotive for a smog test and after inspection we found out we needed a lot of repairs. We received detailed pictures and evaluations right away. Nick gave us an estimate and kept in communication while the repairs were being worked on. Nick even stayed after hours to make sure he completed the job and get our van back to working order. This was a huge positive as lacking a car was stressful, and we are grateful to get it back soon, and fixed. We highly appreciate nicks honest, upfront detailed approach to business. We will definitely be taking our business back to him in the future. Thank you Anderson Automotive.<//Review>

Turned us away because our car was too old to smog. They should have a sign that says "new cars only" News flash! 80% of cars on the road are older cars. *1999 or older.</review>

{'time': 1571805704227, 'text': 'Hi Alex, Sorry about that, unfortunately as much as we like to have self accountability, this one is on the state of California, they have made the machine that smogs older (1999 and older) vehicles very expensive. It is no longer feasible for us to afford this machine with the amount of smogs we do. We do our best to be a one stop shop, but in this case it just doesn’t make sense. We should have made a recommendation to you to a smog shop that does smog older vehicles that we recommend. If you need anything else on your vehicle let us know, I’m sure if you did business with us you would be satisfied. Unfortunately having not done any business with us at all I can’t do much in the way of making this right.\n\nThanks, Nick'}<//Resp>

My cataract surgery, both eyes, was flawless, and painless. Dr. Younger without question, is a top of the line ophthalmologist.  I could not be more pleased with the care and patience used by him leading to surgery and making post surgery recovery comfortable and worry-less.

The staff at Orange Coast Eye Center are professional! They come across as very pleasant, caring, listen, and provide accurate answers to asked question.  What more can you ask.<//Text>

<review>It is more than four years that I am a patient of Orange coast Eye Center. What a delighted experience. Personally I am so concerned and picky about doctor's office or clinic. Do they care about sanitation, being neat and clean. Fortunately, gladly they are. Especially, an eye clinic. When I walked in for the first time, immediately I  said to myself  thanks god. All rooms, waiting room, whole clinic so neat and shiny. All equipments cleaned and covered. Dr. Manzi spending more than enough time about all details. Now Dr. Younger taking care of us. Same professional  caring. I have no worrying about my problems, like glaucoma, all neccessary tests done on time. If I forget my eye drops, they don't. Staff are so friendly and helpful, well educated. Right now because of this nasty virus, they are very cautious, about mask, social distance. Which I really, really appreciate it. O C E C, great job<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<review>I think highly of this eye center. You are taken on time and checked thoroughly, regardless of the reason for the appointment. I have been going to Dr. Manzi for twenty years (at least) and when Dr. Younger joined his staff he did my cataract surgery. Dr. Manzi recently retired and will be missed. However, Dr Younger is a great replacement.< /review>< pics>

I switched eye doctors to Dr. Younger over three years ago and could not be happier. He and his staff are true professionals and do everything possible to make your visit a positive experience, treat any eye problems you are having, and also maximize your insurance to get the most out of your vision plan.
I bought glasses each year and was truly amazed at how much they saved me on the frames and lenses. The Optical Boutique is very helpful in all aspects of selecting corrective eyewear.
If you are looking for a professional office who will meet all of your eye care needs go see the Orange Coast Eye Center and Dr. Younger.<//review>

Everything about OCEC is 5-star: Welcoming and comfortable from the time you walk through the doors, friendly and helpful staff, very minimal wait time, and excellent doctors. We now live over an hour away, but it's 100% worth the drive. Dr. Younger is fantastic! I also see Dr. Vu now, and am very happy with her! I have great peace of mind knowing that the health of my eyes is in very capable hands.</review>

<text>I love going to this friendly, upbeat and totally state of the art eye center.  They have been wonderful to work with after I had gone to the same eye Dr. for 40 years, who always greeted me with a wonderful "two hand" hand shake at the beginning of our appointment.
Dr. Vu has put up with my silly rambling when I'm not completely sure of the testing she does on me.
Dr. Manzi even gave me a hand shake last visit as well as an all good eye review with lots of smiles!
Dr. Jared Younger did my cataract surgery and it went perfect!
The girls, so many I forgotten their names, are super nice and take extra care when I tell them I hate the dilation process...
THANKS TO ALL OF YOU<//text>< pictures>

Dr Younger and staff are wonderful. I was having trouble seeing in one of my eyes and they saw me right away. Dr Younger explained what was happening which put my mind at ease. I highly recommend them to family and friends as well as anyone in need of eye care.< /Review>

I was lucky enough to be recommended to Dr. Jared Younger for my eye exam.  It was such a pleasure.  The office was neat, clean and organized.  The staff was knowledgeable and professional and kind and fun.  Dr. Younger does not keep you waiting.  It was the easiest and least painful eye exam I have ever had.  He detected a high glaucoma rate but said because of the density (not sure what) of my eyes it could have been an untrue reading so he is watching my eyes.  I go back for my third visit and he will determine whether or not I need medication, I so appreciated that he didn't just immediately hand me a prescription.  His manor is very kind and he and all his staff are very nice and sweet.  They even helped me pick out my frames.  If  you need to see an eye doctor RUN to  Dr. Jared Younger, I'm so glad I did and so is my husband, he is  also a patient.< /Review>

<Text>Orange Coast Eye Center along with Dr. Manzi and Dr, Younger have kept me seeing all these years.  I am now 77 1/2.  Yes, before age 5 and after age 75 we count half years. After my cataract surgeries last year, I can now read and drive without glasses and the pressure on the inside of my eyes is now normal.  I just had the pressure on my eyes tested here in Thailand. Thank you to you all, again.</Text>< username>

I have been a patient here for two years.  I appreciate that they were able to work me in promptly one day when I needed an urgent exam due to a sudden change in my vision.  The entire staff is courteous, professional, and personable.  Everyone takes the time to listen.  My most obnoxious problem is dryness of the eyes, and the doctor started me on a medication that has almost completely relieved my symptoms.  I recommend this medical group.< /Text>

I have been a patient of the Orange Coast Eye Center for many, many years, and would not change. Both Dr. Manzi and Dr. Younger are outstanding physicians, and the staff is equally excellent. I have had a number of difficulties and serious issues with my eyes and they did not rest until solutions to my problems were found.</Text>

Excellent experience with staff and doctors.  I needed a laser eye procedure and everything was handled perfectly from start to finish.  Dr. Younger was very professional, highly skilled, and very available and communicative.  I recommend the office and doctors highly.  As a physician myself, I truly appreciate the quality of this ophthalmology practice.<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Younger performed laser cataract surgery on both of my eyes. "I can see clearly now" with 20/20 vision. His pre-op and post-op care enabled me to complete the procedures with no complications whatsoever. Dr. Younger and his staff are the best. If you are considering cataract surgery, Dr. Younger is your surgeon.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>As a retired  ophthalmologist I did surgery for 30 years. I wanted a young surgeon as I knew surgery techniques are always improving each year of training. Doctor Younger was my choice especially when the ophthalmologist who purchased my practice recommended him. From the moment I entered Doctor Younger's office I knew I was in the correct place. Every one there knew their exact job and carried it out like clockwork. The initial examination was very through and extensive. Since I have been there I have had both cataracts removed and enjoy 20/20 vision in each eye. I would have no one else do my routine follow ups but Doctor Younger.< /review>< Pictures>

Had I known how simple LASIK surgery is, I would have done it much sooner! Dr Younger is an amazing surgeon and put me at ease through the whole process. I was back at work the next day with 20/15 vision! I am thrilled with the results and couldn't be more thankful to Dr Younger and Orange Coast Eye Center for giving me my vision back. Glasses and contact free is the way to be :)< /Review>

I have been going to the OC Eye Center for over 20 years and would highly recommend it to anyone.  I feel they have the best eye care and are on top of all situations.

My husband and I both had our cataract surgeries there and my Retnaologist said that whoever did my surgery did a wonderful job.  As far as I am concerned that is the only place to go for that type of surgery...very professional and a great staff.</text>

<text>I have been going to Orange Coast Eye Center for about 2 year. Dr. Manzi has been watching the progress of the cataracts in both of my eyes. On August 10th Dr Younger did the cataract surgery on my left eye. I will be having the right eye done on the 31st and I can't wait. I'm so excited to be able to see true color which I never thought I lost. I am so pleased with everyone at Orange Coast Eye Center for making me feel so comfortable and trusting with my eyes. I would recommend them 100% to anyone that is looking for a new eye doctor. They are the best.</text>< gmapID>

Upon completion of my second visit at Orange Coast Eye Center, my thoughts regarding my first visit were confirmed.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  Any questions I have regarding my eye care are answered without a hint of that infamous "bothered" look we all experience from time to time and without a  demeaning tone.  This holds true whether it be Doctor Manzi or any member of the staff.< /review>

They do not try and upsell you into various tests or high end glasses you can't afford. They have a great selection of frames moderate to high end; but they didn't push them on me. I'm very happy to be in this practice.<//Review><gmapID>0x80dd27372ac1d3c1:0xc240673b20a12137< /gmapID>< Resp>

<text>The doctors really care about the well being of the patient and take the time needed to assure all of the patients questions and concerns are answered fully, The staff is one of the best I have seen, and the offices are always clean and comfortable. Both of the doctors strive for and achieve an excellent treatment environment for their patients.< /text><rate>5<//rate><user_name>Ian Badger</user_name>< userid>

<review>I have been getting quarterly checkups with Dr. Lincoln Manzi for the last 5 years, and every visit has been handled smoothly and professionally.  Great staff, and very little wait time.  Also, had cataract surgery in 2018 with Dr. Jared Younger, which was performed well and managed perfectly by the team at OC Eye Center.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

My experience at Orange Coast Eye Center was outstanding.   My examination by Dr. Manzi was terrific, and the selection of frames was great. I believe that the likelihood of my blindness as I age has been significantly reduced.

I look forward to a future with good eyesight.</review>

My husband and I have been going to Orange Coast Eye Center for about 3 years.  The staff is helpful and friendly,  The wait time is less than 15 minutes; the doctors take their time with you, are thorugh, and make sure to answer all questions.  We are very happy.<//review>

I was delighted to be referred to OC Eye Center after being lost in a large eye clinic where doctor convenience seemed more important than patient needs. Dr. Younger performed my second cataract surgery also combined with glaucoma surgery and the difference in faster healing and comfort was amazing. I heartily recommend OCEC on all counts.

I am delighted to learn that Dr. Manzi retired in December 2019 and look forward to continuing eye care at the Center.<//text>

Each time I've visited Dr. Manzi and the Orange Coast Eye Center, I've been welcomed with smiles and professionalism from the entire staff. Everyone there takes the time to make you feel comfortable and to give you the best eye exam experience possible.  It's always a pleasure to be there.       - Patricia Rieff</review>

<Text>I've been seeing Dr. Manzi since the 70's. Recently, my 93 y/o Mom was advised to have cataract surgery by another physician  whose office staff were atrocious. I referred her to Dr. Manzi who determined that she didn't need cataract surgery, yet. My Mom loves the good doctor and his wonderful staff as much as I do.</Text>< user_id>

I can't say enough about these fine people. Dr. Younger restored 20/20 vision to my elderly wife who had been legally blind since birth. A miracle to us. Dr. Manzi examines and treats my eyes which keeps me flying at age 74.

We value the genius of these doctors such that we drive from Arizona to Orange Coast Eye Center for our appointments. Their staff is equally awesome. This reminds me that I need to make an appointment soon.
Update 18th January 2018.  Still drive in from Arizona as I've tried all the eye doctors here and whilst there are some very good doctors here, they still don't measure up to the level of O.C. Eye Centre. They are without question the very best and when it comes to my vision I only want the best.<//Text>

<Review>Dr Lincoln L. Manzi is a very professional and excellent Ophthalmologist.
He took care of our vision care for me and my wife  for more than 20 year.
We can never ask for a better doctor. Thank you Dr. Lincoln. God Bless.

I can't say enough good things about Drs. Manzi and Younger, and their caring staff. My husband and I have been seeing them for many, many years.
I can only recommend them from the bottom of my heart.< /text>

I was very disheartened to find out that they may preach Gods love but they ignore peoples pain and needs. Why would I give offering to a church that only asks for money for themselves but turn away the needy claiming they have no funds for that. How sad....

C.R. at Judson Baptist Church is a outstanding place. We who understand our errors in the sight of Christ and how we need Him to pray for us because of our desire to do what will eventually ruin our lives, and hurt others along the way.

These men and women have set aside the pride and surrendered their hearts to the One who loves them.

In so doing God favors the meek. And meekness is not weakness! On the contrary...Numbers 12:3.<//Review>

<text>So thankful for the REAL reviews previous clients of Platinum have left! I feel so grateful although so sad so many people have had such a terrible experience. I’m very fortunate God nudged me to pull back and away from working with this company. It was something I could not shake after speaking with a very charismatic  and smooth talking SALESMAN (whatever his job title is, he’s a sales person- I even said please don’t sell to me) the very smooth sales talk nature is what truly alarmed me. I truly am so grateful God intervened on this by nudging me to look into this company and see the experiences from people. None of the positive reviews had ANY real details. The negative reviews all had very good details and I reached out to one who told me in detail their experience.

I hope that anyone who comes across the company reads the reviews and takes them seriously and doesn’t move forward. I spoke to another company where I live and they were much more down to earth and straight forward about the situation.

Please don’t work with these guys. I’m so grateful I didn’t. Plus their responses to people’s reviews Are hysterically classless. Another reason I couldn’t move forward! Can’t wait to see if they respond to mine in the same arrogant condescending tone. I can’t wait to share that to my social media following and have a laugh!!</text>< GmapID>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>My experience with them was getting them to return my calls was almost nonexistent. They sent me a email addendum to sign that darn near doubled my payment to them. I repeatedly tried to talk to Chris about why my payment was going to be much higher than I had agreed to. To the point I finally had to put a stop payment on my monthly payment to them. Well, that certainly got their attention. and I finally got a call from them. Turns out they were trying to charge me for filing returns which most likely wasn’t necessary since I had no income for that period. I really wanted to like those guys and feel confident they were doing what they said they were doing. My case manager kept asking for paperwork that I had already sent her or I did not have. Rachall , case manager, really gave me the impression she wasn’t in to doing too much . That’s just how she came across to me in my opinion. I honestly wish this would have worked out. Feel like I’m starting over with square one now. Form your own opinion and good luck with them.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Platinum Tax Defenders has helped me with my tax situation. The process was sometimes long and I think I lost hope on clearing this up many times however, in the end it was resolved and I am extremely pleased with the outcome!<//review>

<Time>1622386252768< /Time><Rating>1<//Rating><Text>My mother was told she would be given a refund of her funds and they have prolonged giving her money back. When she called in reference to the check not being received after a month of waiting, David avoided her calls at first. We had to try calling from a different number to get them, once we got in contact they first stated that they were still sending the check but then shortly became rude when questioned. They didn't want my mother asking why hasn't the check already been sent like you said previously.  They then had someone named Vince to give the same run around statements. This all started in March and still in May (currently) she has not received her funds. They tried to bribe us to take down the review to send her money. They said because of our review they have not returned her money even as of today. After this experience it is hard to believe they are not the ones putting up those so called positive reviews on this platform. We know next time that only the IRS can deal with issues with Taxes. It is less of a hassle to just pay the IRS.< /Text>< Pics>

I really want to highlight the professionalism and care Platinum Tax Defenders put into my case. My representative, Joelle was very knowledgeable about my options for tax relief. Although I procrastinated on fixing my situation for years. I'm glad I finally took that step on getting it handled. I would recommend this firm to anyone facing a tax issue.<//Review>

I worked with the team at Platinum Tax Defenders and within months they had my IRS situation handled and the garnishment on my paychecks released!! They were very quick to respond when I had questions and very professional and friendly. I will definitely be referring friends to them if they are ever in a situation I was in.

I could have done what they did. They don’t do the forms I needed or help with reducing my payment. Waste of money, don’t bother.
All they did was fill in the same paperwork you can do for free on the irs website.<//Text>

I am extremely disappointed with the service I received from a employee by the name of JT. He continued to lie to me and when I asked him why I would be paying more than what the IRS was stating I owed he continued to talk over me and then proceeded to send me text messages that consist of "if you were smart" "good luck paying your penalties in full"
Is this the type of professional attitude yall speak the the IRS with? In no way should I be belittled by an employee of yours. I still have all of the messages and I will be reporting him.<//Review>

My experience with Platinum Tax Defenders was excellent. From the moment I reached out to Platinum, I received exceptional customer services. Their team of professionals (yes professionals) made me feel like they would take care of everything and they did. My representative was extremely knowledgeable, and courteous. I never had to chase after him for questions or responses. He made me feel like I was the only client. Everything he said he would do, he did. This was the kind of personal service we all would like to receive, but unfortunately more than not don’t. I gladly recommend Platinum Tax Defenders, if you are looking for someone to help you in dealing with the IRS. I did and it was the best thing I did.< /review>

I paid these folks $800 to handle a small IRS debt. I was told by Melisa Palida (?) that it was handled even though I kept on receiving letters from the IRS, stating I owe the same amount plus interest. Now I call about the same debt and Vince Pauls is asking for $1350. I think he wants me to give him 1350 cuss words because thats all I have to give at this point. If I knew what I know now, I would work on a payment plan with the IRS from Jump.  I am a cancer survivor and I'm on a fixed income. Shame on you! Plantium Tax Defenders!
Now it's 4:51 and an attorney is emailing on their behalf. I'm ready! Bring it on!</Review>

<text>They are a bunch of ripoffs. I had a payment agreement already In place before signing with them. I was under the impression they would be able to lower my owed taxes, negative! They actually had me remove my current plan to get started with them. Charged me 1650.00!just to get right back in the plan I had owing the same amount. They are very misleading and please don’t trust them!!!!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Platinum Tax helped my wife & I get through a debt crisis with internal revenue. We were owing quite a bit for a couple years of back taxes and when we spoke with this company they told us they could help us and that it would take about 6 months. After our case was complete we ended up only paying a settlement amount to the IRS instead of what we owed in the first place. Well worth it.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Highly recommended!!!! Working with Platinum Tax Defenders was an incredible experience. I never thought I would say this dealing with the IRS, but they made it so seamless and easy for me that I didn't even realize how long the process took. Thank you platinum and the team for helping me in this gruesome process of dealing with the IRS. I have tried dealing with them directly in the past but not luck, and hours of being on hold was just not possible for me having a full time job.

You guys are truly amazing!!!< /review>

Like many of the other TRUE reviews here, they did the same to me. Two years ago, they asked for $1200 to have my, relatively small (<$5000), IRS debt taken care of. Instead, they did nothing but claim to have tried to call me, claim to try and contact me, when they did no such thing. After two years of nothing being done, and after the IRS took over $1000 in refunds, they tell me that there is nothing they can do but set me up with a payment plan. If I applied my $1200 to the debt and added it to the refunds I was owed, I would have almost paid the debt by now. I also got my "case" passed around from "agent" to "agent"....don't fall for this scam.<//Review>

<text>Recently I found myself in a unfamiliar situation. I owed the IRS thousands of dollars. I was really lost. I called five different companies who advertised they could help. After talking with all of them I chose Platinum Tax Defenders! I had no prior experience with owing the IRS money so I had no experience with tax lawyers. It was a large leap of faith on my part to hire them. They helped me understand my options and what they could do for me. Platinum negotiated on my behalf and saved me more than I thought was even possible. Every promise they made, they kept. I can't say enough good things about them. They are both professional and personable. I always felt good I had them on my side.<//text>< Pics>

Bait and switch. Do not sign a contract with this company. Personal experience with this company is that it conveniently hides behind miscommunication, misdirection, and other tactics to collect your money without offering anything in return. In short, after signup and payment there was no contact for over a month despite numerous attempts to reach out to my “advisor”. Of course the person that had originally signed me up had quit and then they gave me the run around, reassigning me to other “specialists” until my time sensitive tax issue was so far along it wasn’t even worth pursuing. Of course PTD had already gotten an air tight signed contract, delivered nothing, and got paid for it. I hope one of you reads this and takes your hard earned money elsewhere rather than help these crooks keep their lights on as if it’s your duty, just because they convince you to sign a piece of paper. Companies like this need to just fade away. Please take a moment to read the REAL experiences of customers, not the ones they hire people to write. If you filter through the 1 star reviews here you will see my experience mirrors that of all other others that paid and got the same runaround. The employee that signed me up and had quit eventually got back to me and let me know how they have employees write positive reviews for them!< /Review>

<response>{'time': 1594755815574, 'text': 'Dear JRR:  I would love to address your issues.  If you would like to contact us with your name, we would be happy to address.  We rely heavily on the information that our clients are telling us on the intake call.  I would highly recommend that anyone calling in be ACCURATE and TRUTHFUL with their income and expenses to avoid any confusion. We tell our prospective clients (and this is clearly spelled out in our contract) that you the results are only as accurate as the information that we are provided.  We are providing a resolution plan that is within your ability to pay, that does not create a financial hardship and keeps you protected from unforeseen garnishments.  We have a team of people who are working on a case and the intake agents are NOT the resolution people working on your case and that is explained in the introductory call.   So again, without knowing the details of your case, I cannot comment except to tell you that we have thousands of happy clients and we do not have our employees write reviews.  We have an "A+" rating  with the BBB and that is verified with people\'s emails so disgruntled employees or competitors cannot put out fake negative reviews.   We have a team of people who can be reached at any time to discuss our client\'s cases and we care about our reputation and the services that we provide.\n\nThanks'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x80e82effab7daca9:0x39a5398357af223d< /Gmap_id></record>

I hope I don't have to deal with the IRS again, but that is just my wishful thinking, and since finding Platinum Tax Defenders to help me with my IRS tax debt, I guess I don't have to worry about dealing with the IRS at all. All I had to do was to sign a power of attorney and give them my financials, and they took it from there.
I usually don't write reviews, but this time, I felt right to do so. Thank you, Platinum Tax, for all your help! I will recommend to friends and family who need any accounting services, which is almost everyone I know.</Text>

they helped me a lot. I just did not know what exacty I would do if i did not hire them, I received a wage garnishment letter and although it was tough on me to come up with the money to pay for their service, it would have been so much worse if they didn't stop the garnishment for me. Great job!< /text>

I was in a payment plan with the IRS when I owed again and got kicked out. I contacted Platinum and they determined that I qualified for a hardship. Now I don't have to make payments anymore. I am so relieved because it was truly hard on me to make those payments. They are also working with me to help me with my exemptions so I don't owe again and I don't have refunds that will get taken from me.</review>

I made it my mission to let everyone know how this fantastic company has helped my husband and me. We have been struggling to pay taxes, and year over year, the back taxes, penalties, and compound interests by the IRS accumulated to be over $65k. But Platinum Tax Defenders, helped us negotiate with the IRS and got us approved for an offer in compromise program and reduced our taxes to less than $1k. We can not thank you enough for all you have done and this financial freedom that we couldn't have gotten without your help. We highly recommend this company to anyone who has any tax debt.</text>

<text>I have had a tax debt for many years, I kept putting my head in the sand and was afraid to actually find out what I owed. I finally contacted Platinum and they did an investigation and pulled all my transcripts and told me what the best resolution plan would be for me. They even applied the investigation fee towards my resolution fee. What a relief. I would have saved money if I dealt with it sooner because of the Penalties involved.<//text><response>None< /response>< username>

<Review>I highly recommend this company, they are professional and ethical, not what you would expect from this industry. I say this because I have previously hired another tax relief company, and I was disappointed at their service. Platinum tax helped me with my wage garnishment issue, they got me release and negotiated with the IRS on my behalf. They were transparent from the beginning, and that got me to sign up with them at first. Thank you, platinum tax; I will defiantly refer my friends and do my tax preparation with your company too.</Review><user_name>Mia Johnson</user_name><Gmap_id>0x80e82effab7daca9:0x39a5398357af223d< /Gmap_id>< pics>

I am very sorry to read so many bad reviews.  My experience with the Platinum Tax Defenders was very good.  My situation was hopeless.  I owed almost $10,000.00 to the IRS and no way to pay it.  Furthermore the IRS was going to start garnishing my wages.  I tried myself to negotiate with the IRS but they were completely impossible.  I don’t understand why the IRS is so fanatical about collecting from a low income earner like myself, and allow rich people to get away with paying very little.  Thanks to the negotiations of the Platinum Tax Defenders my case was placed on “noncollectable status”.  It did take almost an entire year, and I was beginning to lose hope, but Platinum Tax Defenders stayed on my case and they kept me informed every step of the way.  I am thankful that my tax burden has been lifted.  This is not a fake testimonial.  Please feel free to contact me and I will show you the documents.<//Text>

They made they got their $1,000.00 up front before they did nothing. I found out after I paid them, from a reputable tax resolution company. Rush Tax Resolutions that no company would be able to help me in my case since I am as already on a payment plan with the IRS and I owe the IRS less than $10k. Rush tax told me that Platinum should not have taken my money. When I got Platinum tax defenders' closing letter stating "Congratulations"! We have revised your payment plan with the IRS. Good luck." Well they did not revise anything with IRS. My installment plan payment and due date remains the same as before I ever contacted them. Rush tax were blown away. They told me I should demand my money back and report them to the district attorney. They said Platinum wouldn't care if I report to BBB because they don't care about their reputation. When the resolutions manager  Eric Anderson at Platinum called me back finally, I noticed he didn't care cause he was eating while talking to me, saying they closed my file in error. They will reopen and try to help me when my bankruptcy is discharged. I have not received any correspondence from them since closing letter over 1 month ago. So I'm not convinced. I have left Eric
Many voice mails requesting my money back because I dont have that kind of money to tu throw away with no resolution. When I mention money back , Eric has never called me back. My bk attorney told me this  crooked  outfit is not going to call you or return your money. I also want to mention that before I called platinum I called Rush tax, they said no we cant help you we wont take your money for reasons I mentioned before. Then I called Optima tax relief. They also did not take my money, but they referred me to Platinum tax. I called Optima to explain what platinum did, and to suggest they no longer refer to platinum. They said the were sorry. They would look into it. Consumer beware of dishonest crooks like Platinum Tax Defenders that don't care who's money.< /Review>

I have had a good experience with Platinum Tax Defenders. I received some papers from them because it says they accepted the negotiation, but I need them to call me or give me more orientation about how I am going to pay the $500 that I have to pay the IRS. Overall though, they are great. They also gave me a payment plan, so they helped me a lot. I have been recommending them to my friends and people I know.< /review>

Platinums payment plans are the best!!! They got my payment plan lowered from $400 a month to $100 a month. The Enrolled Agent who took my case @ Platinum also waived my $2500 in penalties and fees. Everything was super easy with Platinum I just sat back and let them work.<//text>

Platinum Tax Defenders were extremely nice, me and my wife asked a lot of questions because we are totally clueless about the process on how to resolve our tax issue. We hire them to take care of our taxes. They seem to know what they are doing! We will definitely keep working with Platinum tax defenders in the future.<//Text>

< Review>
I sought out a 3rd option after the IRS only gave me two repayment options that didn't fit my financial ability. Platinum Tax Defenders takes $500 to open your investigation, and suggests that they may be able to reduce the amount you have to pay back. The details were vague, but I get it, every case is different. I paid the fee and over the course of the next few weeks, we exchanged forms and information to get the investigation started. I was told the $500 would be a one-time fee that covered EVERYTHING. I was also told I'd be issued a case manager that I would deal with one-on-one. I dealt with a different person EVERY time. Finally they offered me a resolution that would require that I go into a "current but not collectible" status, which essentially means they would collect from my subsequent returns. I agreed to this, and then they notified me of a "resolution fee" of $350. This was the first mention of this fee throughout the entire process. I reluctantly paid it. Immediately after my payment was accepted, they told me that I actually didn't qualify for this program, and set me up with an immediate 6-year repayment plan. I feel like I've been completely scammed. Lies upon lies upon lies. Avoid this company at all costs, they act in a predatory and suspicious way.

P.S. after taking my money and seeing my bad reviews, they threatened me with legal action unless Ii deleted all of my reviews. I obliged, but the BBB would not let me delete my review, so they canceled the power of attorney, kept my money, and I'm right back where I started.< /Review>

Was promised they could eliminate my tax debt if I sent them $1200 right away. Sent them payment and didn't hear from anyone for a while. Once they got back to me i was told i was still liable for 100% of tax debt. When I asked for a refund they said the $1200 went to lawyer fees. SCAM!! Don't waste your money here.<//Text>

< Review>
Though friendly and very informative of tax programs(which I did not qualify for), this was a complete waste of time.   They made it very hard for me to contact them as I left several voicemails and couldn't get anyone to return a call.   One person was sick and the other took a vacation.  When all was said and done, I still owed the same amount to the IRS plus late penalties.   They did set me up on a payment plan with both state and tax, but I can't help feeling like I could've done that myself.    So basically I paid for nothing.   My advice to you all is to be wary of any tax consultants who ask for a fee upfront.   You may be getting scammed.   If your debt is under 5000 and you are on middle class income,   I urge you to just stay away from Platinum.   You're better off contacting the IRS on your own.   The IRS will look at your income and set you up on a payment plan accordingly.  I hope this review is helpful.<//Review>

My husband and I were dealing with the IRS for 2 years, back and forth nonstop. Platinum Tax Defenders was able to get more done with our debt than we have since! We both owed the IRS 10k, after telling Platinum the hardship we were in they settled our debt for 100 dollars!!<//review>

The employees at Platinum Tax Defenders are super knowledgeable. I am self employed and filing taxes can be confusing with knowing what to write off. Having them in my corner gives me confidence that I am doing my taxes the right way. If you need taxes filed or owe money to the Government, I would highly recommend them.</Text>

So, I had a tax issue with the IRS. I had attempted to work with the IRS directly to figure out the best course of action regarding my situation. However, after months of being put on hold and not getting anywhere  I called Platinum tax defenders. When I called them, I got a hold of this very nice guy named Justin. He was extremely helpful, professional and kind, when helping me figure out how to tackle my situation. By the end of conversation, he set me up in great program and now months later I have a reasonable monthly payment to the IRS and I’m actually seeing my balance go down instead of growing!!!! In addition, every time I call Platinum Tax Defenders, I get an answer so I must disagreee with the negative reviews I’ve read thus far, just does not seem truthful.< /text>

This place is a complete waste of time and money. Often, it took days for them to respond to my emails. I paid them $1,000 dollars to handle my case. Although I didn't expect them to completely eliminate what I owed the IRS, they did promise that they could get me a reduction. I was passed around to work with multiple people. In the end they told me that I only qualified for a payment plan. This was something I could have gotten from the IRS on my own. The money I paid them could have been used to pay down what I owed in taxes. David Krausse is supposedly an attorney at this place, but it sounds like he's on the side of the IRS. He was not a friendly person at all and didn't seem to care about fighting for a reduction in the amount owed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!

UPDATE: I don't know who this guy is below, but I make nowhere near $6,900 a month. He is clearly pulling numbers out of the sky on this. Nice try, buddy, but you're dead wrong.</Text>

I pulled money out of my 401K when I had a health issue.  I didn't claim it as income so I got a letter from the IRS saying that I owed a bunch of money.  Platinum put me in hardship and got the IRS off my back.  I am so thankful to them.< /text>

I have been waiting for and update on my issue and every time I call they transfer you around and the issue never gets answered, and they say they called me...  ahhhh nope...   I was recommended to them by another agency..  I am contacting the authorities and I am still waiting for a call from Eric and have several emails from Perla that remain unanswered.  and in talking to the state they have had no contact with them..   I will post daily with an update ....

These people took my money, and then dropped my case. They did not help me at all. If you are smart you will never hire these people. Go with someone else.</text>

<Review>Before I found Platinum Tax Defenders , I had an IRS debt that was pretty sizeable and cause me plenty of worrying because I am on fixed income and couldn't afford to set up an continuing payoff plan that would last for years while accumulating more interest. While searching the internet looking for a tax relief solution I found a list of agencies specializing in tax issues with the IRS and because of their high rating and affordability I chose Platinum Tax Defenders and I am glad I did so.They have been very helpful, professional and on point and now my tax problem is resolved and I can breath easier. Thanks.<//Review>< user_name>

<text>Terrible experience.  They take forever to get back to you, and I had to email them several times to get an update. I paid them to look into my case and letting them know I already had a payment plan set up, but I was looking to get it reduced because it was too high. They then came back and gave me a payment plan $140 more then I was already paying with the IRS.  Complete waste of my time and money!  When I asked for a refund they declined. DONT waste your time and money not worth it.</text><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>This company is a fraud! It was a year ago that I dealt with these scumbags with taking unauthorized transactions out of my bank account. Fast forward a year with no issues, they take out over $300 out of my account! And I have had no contact with them in over a year after telling them I no longer want to deal with them! Platinum tax defenders your company will no be under investigation for fraud! Thanks for taking money out of our account without my authorization, that money was to be used for my children’s food, formula, and diapers!<//text>< Pictures>

Somehow, in my youth I missed filing a year with CT IRS and I wanted to get it resolved . I called CT IRS and got passed around from person to person and  each person gave me completely different info. So I called Optum (heard on the radio) who had me call Platinum and Brandon (CS) and Sandy (Handler) worked ever so hard ! If anything, I was the slow one.  Although there was a 2nd Platinum fee (350) to actually handle the case (after all the info was gathered)I feel it was worth it in my case .They got my $2600 in IRS fees removed and I finally figured out how much I owed which I paid immediately!
Thank you ever so much. I didn't think something like this could be possible but it is! - PS - I never write reviews but this one was worth it!< /text>

WHY DOES GOOGLE MAKE ME PUT A STAR??? These are the worst people to deal with. Please run, run, run away from this company. I paid them 2,500 to help me reach an agreement with the federal and state tax. THREE, yes THREE years later nothing. After getting getting garnished because they failed to do their job they won't refund me my money. Saying they did this and that and that they worked hard for that money. They still have the nerve to contact the IRS and try and get me to sign an installment agreement after I asked them to stop all communication on my behave. Just like everyone else said here they never give you updates. I would always have to call or email for updates and then they'd say we'll contact you when we hear something and guess what they never did until I called! Just please don't waste your time and money on these people!</Review>

Dear owner:. I am christian Alejandro. I couldn't answer on my account (because it was a review). That's why I am using a friend's account.
You want me to call you to discuss?
I called you several times to the point that the person who answered the phone already knew my name. I called many times with no answer from you and now you want me to call?
All I have to say is to check out your business and how your people is handling it.  if you have any questions regarding my "file" records, ask Anthony Pavlov as he works for you.
I personally don't care anymore because I found someone competent to take care of my issue Which is what I wanted from the beginning.
Good luck to you and your business and if you are interested on your business, watch it closely.<//review>

A waste of money. It took 6 months to get any solution which I could have done myself. I am contacting our states attorney generals office for fraud. I have left multiple messages and they simply do not return calls. Today is 3/4. I called and asked to speak to Lynn a manager I spoke to about 4 weeks ago in a FINAL attempt to resolve my issue. She refused to talk to me so I am contacting the attorney general here in Indiana. I will also be contacting the BBB.</text>

This place is a complete waste of time and money. Often, it took days for them to respond to my emails. I paid them $1,000 dollars to handle my case. Although I didn't expect them to completely eliminate what I owed the IRS, they did promise that they could get me a reduction. I was passed around to work with multiple people. In the end they told me that I only qualified for a payment plan. This was something I could have gotten from the IRS on my own. The money I paid them could have been used to pay down what I owed in taxes. David Krausse is supposedly an attorney at this place, but it sounds like he's on the side of the IRS. He was not a friendly person at all and didn't seem to care about fighting for a reduction in the amount owed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!<//Text>

< review>
I recently was put in contact with Platinum Tax Defenders through Optima Tax Relief. This company is at first seems very legitimate, but they quickly proved to be the shame everyone here says they are. After speaking with a representative named Mark about my situation i decided to do further research into other tax relief companies, tower during this weeks time I began receive text from Mark that were extremely unprofessional for any business. Upset with this I attempted to call and speak to a supervisor about this poor display of professionalism, and was told by the next representative I spoke to that I could not speak to a supervisor or manager. That representative then I assume told Mark I was calling to complain, and I received another unprofessional text from Mark expressing his displeasure with me attempting to call a supervisor. I’ve contacted the corporate office of Optima as well as the better business bureau and filed complaints.

***UPDATE***
I’m updating my review because it seems the “owner” has responded to my review. Yes “owner” I am positive I have the right company. In fact if you would like to discuss this situation in detail I can provide phone records as well as screen shot of from your employee harassing me. All of which have been provided to Optima and BBB.<//review>

<Review>I have many clients that have tax concerns. Being in real estate and mortgage it has prevented my clients  from purchasing a home. Many of my clients have large tax debt either with IRS or the FTB. Sherri and her team has been able to make payment arrangements and or settle their debt for them. Because of the work that Sherri and her team has accomplished by taking the time necessary negotiate these debts my clients have been able to obtain the American dream of owning of purchasing a home. Sherri is dedicated upbeat and tenacious. All qualities necessary to take on governmental and state entities.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>Avoid this company like the plague!!!!!! They tell you they can provide all this help to you just to get you to sign up. First they start with a “One time fee of $500 that will cover EVERYTHING” when in fact it doesn’t. I explained my entire case before starting with them including that I worked for the federal government and they told me NO PROBLEM! 2-3 mo the go by and they tell me sorry we don’t deal with federal employees all we can do is set you on a payment plan for another fee of $350 which covers again “Everything”! I was assigned to MELISSA PADILLA AND JUDY they are rude and will scam you more and more!!!!!</Review>< Pictures>

<time>1524981792679< /time><Text>Have you seen on previous reviews how the owner defends his business instead of offering a second go or asking for more feedback to improve his business? (Most businesses do that)
I'll share my case real quick and please read it through so you don't waste your time and money with these people.

Desperate as many people,  I was looking for someone who could help me with the IRS.  I happened to find these guys on line and told them my problem. Anthony Pavlov was very gentle and eager to  "help" he told me he was going to charge 500 dollars on 2 payments taken from my bank account
to what I agreed.  My first sign should've been that he didn't asked for much info from me, ohh but he was very pushy on getting my credit card information so they could get their money and start working on my case( but how can they start to work without information?)  I was suspicious but at the same time I was desperate.  The next day I found someone else who could help me with my IRS issue, plus they lived near me and right away asked me for all the paperwork that I had (you see where I'm going?)  I called platinum tax defenders to gratefully let them know that I wasn't going to need of their services. Anthony answered the phone nicely but as soon as he heard of my intentions, his tone of voice changed dramatically to the point that he was yelling and asking me why I was wasting his time and losing control. Then he asked me to wait in line( I waited 45 minutes then I decided to hang up)  Please Note that I don't want to look like a victim because it was a mistake to go to people or businesses that I didn't know plus  I know what Anthony wouldn't talk to me like that if he was on front of me just because I wouldn't allow it.
The next day "surprise!!!" They took 250 from my account.  I E-mailed  Anthony to let him know of his errors and for them to return the money they took. No answer.
Days passed and I received a call from Anthony reminding me to sign and agreement that he E-mailed me to what I answered with a reminder of his negative behavior. He remembered and hanged up the phone right away.
I called several times to speak to the manager or owner to let him know of what was happening and warning him of how Anthony was handling his business.  He was always busy, on meetings,  out of town, etc.
I had to change my account number to avoid being charged again and gave up on trying to communicate with these clowns.
For the 250 dollars, well it's fine, they can keep it because I know they need that money more than me.

I know the IRS can be stressful but please go to someone with a reliable reputation in order to avoid bigger headaches< /Text></record>

<Review>When I first called Optima, they were not able to give me any help because i didn't owe enough. I was referred to this company and at the time I was skeptical about not working with optima. Optima told me that they were equipped to handle tax problems like mine. I figured that optima wouldn't refer me to someone who isn't credible or professional. Although I read reviews and were very nervous, I decided to give them a shot. I owed about 7,000 to the IRS and am very pleased to say that platinum helped me achieve a very small settlement  of $200. They were very professional along the way, and did what I hired them to do.</Review>< date>

Total scam, do not get involved. Its a rip off!  I submitted all my forms, and current tax years. They did not do one thing to help me but tell me I could make payments. No help! I could have saved the $500 and just landslide I'm doing now. Don't bother!< /review>

<Text>I had already explained to Platinum what I owed IRS. That is why I called, for help with my debt. I gave them $500 with understanding that they would speak to the IRS and let me know the plan moving forward. )500 got me reiteration of my debt with no help at all.

Wish there was a chance to give this place 0 stars. This was absolutely the biggest waste of money and time I have ever encountered. I started the process over a year ago and maybe got two updates from the company over that period. All the other updates I had to call and be told I would be contacted later. Well... later never came I can understand 1 time but over 3 or 4 is ridiculous. The money I spent should of just went to the IRS to pay my balance in full but I trusted them and was sadly mistaken. I HATE WRITING BAD REVIEWS BUT I HAVE TO LET OTHER PEOPLE KNOW. Poor customer service & Terrible communication. I pretty much threw over 1000.00 in the trash. Because they did absolutely nothing for over a year.

UPDATE: The owner got back to me after I wrote this review. Told me everything that happened in that year. Also put it on the consultant that was working with me who is no longer involved with the company.  Then proceeded to ask me to change my review. So here it is Maurice "MY POWER OF ATTOURNEY" that I never heard from during the whole process. Until I paid my debt in full with my income tax & wrote a bad review. Maybe if you cared about your clientele like you do bad reviews you wouldn't have to call to persuade otherwise. Give me back a portion of my money and we will call it even how about that?<//Text>

<Time>1549343925561< /Time><Text>DO NOT USE OR HIRE these guys
Would not even give them 1 star but it’s the only way to write a review. Owed 800 in state taxes and 4000 in federal. ended up paying these guys 800+ dollars to “try” and resolve the debt when I should have just used the money I WASTED with them and paid it off. They say 400 to do a analysis of your tax/tax debt only to tell you if you actually want to do anything it’s another 400. Not only that, the customer service is terrible and they never actually call you back even after leaving multiple messages after reaching out multiple times to contact them. In the end nothing was fixed and I highly highly advise to go a different route unless you like throwing money down the drain. I know I already said it but I feel like it should be said again, DO NOT USE these guys. Such a waste of time.< /Text>< rating>

Please help me understand why putting you in a hardship program where you do not have to pay the IRS or State is not helpful to you?  You signed documentation clearly stating, as well as the recording,  that you signed up for an investigation first.   If we are unsure of your eligibility, we do not want to charge you for full resolution until we are sure what you qualify for.  You understood that on the recording as well as the documentation that you signed.  Once we verified that you qualified for a hardship, we discussed this with you and applied your investigation fee towards this resolution.  Once again, you agreed and we placed your case in a hardship status.  You expressed no concerns at that point.  I'm not sure why the change of heart now.  If you had an issues why wouldn't you raise it with us directly instead of going on line and defaming our company?  f you would like to discuss, please call us at 800-991-6247.\n\nRobert Stevens"}</Resp>< UserId.>

oh let me count the ways. I am writing on behalf of me and my wife who was ripped off my Platinum tax Defenders for over $4800. She originally called into Optima tax relief and was referred to Platinum because  of the uniqueness of her case and assured my mother that she was in good hands. Wow We found out much later how much of a lie that was.

1) The sales rep Michael sounded like a used car salesman and was patronizing to us and very aggressive. He claimed that they will reduce our debt. What they failed to inform us was that that our assets would be paced in jeopardy such as our home which BTW is being seized by the IRS thanks to Platinum's lack of work and ill advice. To be frank I don't think they did a damn thing but make our tax case worse. I ignored all the negative reviews and went against my gut which is my fault but this company needs to be shut down.

2) I have already retained an attorney and am in the process of suing both Platinum Tax Defenders for unethical business practices as well as Optima for referring me to this den of thieves. I am also filing a complaint  with the IRS's Board of professional responsibility for gross negligence.

DO NOT USE Platinum Tax Defenders as they are crooks. BTW, I am not using my real name until these lawsuits are over and these folks are shut down. I'm not stupid and know how they play games. I also notice they deflect by by sidelining the complaints and never taking responsibility for anything. Do the right thing Platinum close your doors and refund every penny you have stolen from innocent people so they can get real representation.<//Text>

<Review>If I can give a -1 score I would. Horrible experience from day 1. Mark never returns your call or email. Once you pay, which is upfront, they never call you with a step by step of what the process is. They’ll have you pay for an investigation, which I dont think they do much of anything, and then you pay more to move forward. No one would contact me and let me know they received my faxed documents. We are sending vital and sensitivw information via fax and not one person would call or respond to my email and let me know they received it. Horrible horrible experience. Wasted $750 which will have to go as a tax write off. STAY CLEAR FROM THIS COMPANY AND GO WITH OPTIMA TAX.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This company is a complete waste of time and money.After a year and a half and after being passed around to multiple employees, we were informed that they were setting up a payment plan with the IRS.We could have done that ourselves. No reduction on what we owe the IRS whatsoever!! This company totally SUCKS!!!DO NOT do business with them!Constantly had to contact them for updates.We wouldn’t hear anything for weeks! Worst company ever! STAY AWAY! We are reporting them to the BBB.</review>

I paid $1000 just to get the same outcome I would have by speaking to the IRS myself. So on top of wasting $1000 I still have to pay my full debt with no type of settlement or alternative resolution. Had I paid attention to the revview the money spent on the could have went towards the debt.

Every complaint I have read here rings true with my experience, so I won’t add my own details. What I would like to point out to anyone reading this is, don’t believe the responses from the “owner” - once they close a case, you are no longer a “client”.....it’s just a matter of semantics when the owner’s response accuses the reviewer of not being a client. The threat of a lawsuit to intimidate the reviewer to remove a review also hits home. So I do wonder how many bad reviews there were originally?</Review>

I used to hear advertisements on my stereo about back taxes and fresh start program so I called to see if my situation was something that could be fixed and these people took care of anything and everything. when i called other places they all sounded like all they cared about a big down payment that me and my wife could not afford at the time,  platinum  only charged $499 at first for what they called investigating my back taxes, everyone else just wanted thousands right away so im glad i went this route insteaed</Review>

Paid our fee and received a horrible run-around for 10 months. None of our debt was relieved. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid our fee, submitted all information and promised we would be helped. Paperwork was done incorrectly but still submitted to the IRS without my consent. Then, it literally took 9 months to FINALLY get ahold of someone to take a second look, admit mistakes were made and correct them. Such a waste of my time, money, and increase in stress level.<//Text>

<Review>RUN!!! This company is a JOKE! Platinum Tax Defenders are legal THIEVES! They make promises and suggestions that they have no intentions of following through with. Once your payments for service have been made, you're lucky to a call back from any of their staff. Mark Garcia, Alexis Gastelum, Angela Garcia, Robert Stevens, and Sherri Gastelum are all thieves! Do not waste your time or money on Platinum Tax Defenders. They will cause more headaches and wage garnishments than they will prevent.< /Review>< pictures>

Without going into 100% of the detail of my situation, I called and explained that I needed help with filing 2016 and 2017, as well as a payment plan to pay my taxes.  I was told by Mark Garcia they could do this for $750.
Be warned: $750 is their "investigation fee".  Their investigation basically turned up everything I'd told them over the phone. They told me I hadn't filed for 2016 & 2017 (Yeah, um, this is why I called for help, ya'll) and that I somehow owed something from 2011 due to my ex husband.  They said filing my taxes & setting up a payment plan with the IRS, WHICH IS WHAT I CALLED FOR HELP WITH IN THE FIRST PLACE, would be an additional fee. They eventually agreed to do my 2016 taxes “as a courtesy” (even their agreement said this would be covered, so no, it’s not considered a courtesy to provide a service for which I paid), but I was still on my own for 2017.
So now, this single mom is out $750 and I got no help from them whatsoever.  It’s hard/near impossible to get an email or phone response. I clearly explained what I needed, was told they could help me, and then I asked AGAIN if $750 would cover everything.  Mark at Platinum said yes, this would cover everything.   I asked if there would be additional fees for the specific help I needed.  I was told no and that cases like mine often result in nothing owed to the IRS. I thought it was great that $750 would likely cover my $8k+ of debt.  I reread the signed agreement and now see that it says "at the sole discretion of PTD" in several places.  So basically, "We'll help if we feel like it. We probaby won't feel like it."
One of my favorite interactions was when I brought up Innocent Spouse Relief, which is supposed to help a current or ex-spouse with tax debt from their partner.  Alexis, the "tax professional" assigned to me, said, "Oh, well you have to prove that you were threatened into signing the return or that you were abused by your spouse."  A quick Google search will show that this has literally nothing to do with coercion or abuse.  This woman clearly did not know what this tax relief was, which makes me think maybe she's not much of a tax professional.
Here's the kicker: when I made a complaint to a consumer agency, some arbitration guy in Texas called me, basically said "these things take time", then told me I could be sued by Platinum if I posted a bad review.
Well, now I'm posting a bad review in every place I possibly can to ensure that this doesn't happen to another single mom or anyone else.  Stay away.  Believe the reviews. They are NOT going to help you.  In fact, they might threaten to sue you for telling other people that their "service" is a scam.<//Review>

<Resp>{'time': 1528929379300, 'text': 'Mr. Posantes requested we assist him with his tax matter. Before we accept anyone as a client we take them through a comprehensive verbal questionnaire to identify if they qualify for our service based on their income, assets and expenses. During this questioning Mr. Posantes stated the his gross monthly income was $2200 per month. Based on that information we agreed to accept him as a client. Once a client, we then requested for him to complete a Financial Organizer which asks for more in depth financial information. Mr, Posantes completed the Financial Organizer and on that form he indicated that his income was $1920 per month, he in fact signed that form indicating that all information he provided was accurate and true. As we progressed with his case and pulled his tax transcripts, wage and income transcripts, and completed a comprehensive tax analysis complete with review of his financial document, it was discovered that his monthly net income was actually 50% higher than what he led us to believe. This case was worked in good faith with the belief that the information provided by Mr. Posantes was accurate. We are sorry that Mr. Posantes feels dissatisfied, but we based taking him on as a client based on what he provided. If Mr. Posantes would like to take look at the document he signed attesting to the fact that his income was $1920 we would be happy to provide it to him.'}</Resp><text>I see too many bad reviews. I was also a victim of Platinum Tax Defenser. Melisa Padilla was the first person with whom I spoke and in that conversation she guaranteed me the service; I believed  in everything what she said, but the truth is other. I sent several times all the documents that they ask for to start my case and apparently they never received it, but when I stop one of the payments they called me right away letting me know that they got all the documents, but they need the payment to continue in my case. I did that payment and few weeks later I called them again and to check the status of my case. They never started my case. Lauren McMurtry was the person who was supposed be working in my case, but she never was in the office, I left several voicemails and I sent few emails and she did responded some of those emails and one day she finally gave up and transferred my case to David Krausse. David called and asking for all the information that I had already sent few months ago; I got so pissed, because I figured out right away that they were playing. Same information that I gave and sent to Melissa and Lauren; I gave to him again and he told me immediately “You Don’t Qualified” and I asked him how can; he gave a completely different story about my case. Honestly don’t trust them. They are professional scammers.<//text>< userid>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Date>1527217647782</Date><Text>I have to say anyone thinking about doing business with this company think again. Iv read the negative reveiws and would have to agree with them. Don't just read the reviews and think it won't happen to you. I also spook to Anthony Pavlov. The first time was professional. I explained to him that I was looking for help getting my penalties from the IRS abatement (forgiven) and that I already paid what I owed the IRS in taxes,  minus the penalties and interest. He said it would cost $500 and that getting a first time abatement is usually successful. I asked if the cost would go up if they where successful in getting penalties wiped clean and he told me it wouldn't be more then $700. I agreed and Anthony Pavlov emailed the paperwork. Months later I received another letter from the IRS and was concerned about it so I gave platinum tax defenders a call. During this two months I was informed that someone else was handling my case. So that is who I called and tried to speak to. He did not answer so I left a messages. He did call back and said not to worry about the letter that they are dealing with it. We talked shortly about the abatement and that he would give me a call every two weeks to keep me informed, Which never happened.
I later got a call about a month and a half later from someone  else, a woman who was nice, but was ovasly misinformed. She started to go over with me why I owed the taxes in the first place. I told her ,I know why I owed the taxes and that I already paid them and that I was looking for help getting penalties abatement. She said that I filled out a form for an explanation of taxes owed. I thought , u got to be kidding me. I told them what I needed help with and they sent me the wrong form and then blame me for signing it. At this point I gave up and decided to just move on which by the sounds of it most people  do. I ended up getting another letter from the IRS. So I thought I would give platinum a call back for a transcript of the recordings. In hope's that they would see that they messed up and would help me out. No luck lol I ended up talking to Anthony Pavlov again. He constantly talks over u and kept telling me I signed the wrong form. I didn't send the form. Did i sign the wrong form or did they just not do their job right and send  me the wrong form for something i never asked for. Long story but in the end Anthony Pavlov refused to give me transcripts of our phone calls. I told him fine I know what I said and what I hired platinum for. So do me a favor and listen to them , and call me back. He said he would try and would give me a call back Monday. Guess what no call it's been 3 weeks and I called twice and left messages. No call back. O and I didn't mention that he also tried to upsell me and told me if I wanted an abatement it would cost $180 more and that it usually cost $500. I laughed and said why should I have to pay anything that's what I originally paid u for. ANY HOW STAY AWAY THEY DEAL WITH IRS TAXES THAT ARE LESS THEN 5K FOR A REASON. MOST COMPANIES WONT TOUCH ANYTHINK UNDER 1OK. JUST THING ABOUT IT ,IT A MAKES SENSE NOW. JUGGING BY THEIR BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. ALSO THEY WILL PROBABLY RESPOND LIKE IM THE ONE THAT IS WRONG SO THEY CAN HAVE THE LAST WORD. BUT IF THATS SO SEND ME A COPY OF THE PHONE RECORDINGS. I THINK NOT< /Text>< rating>

Wish there was a chance to give this place 0 stars. This was absolutely the biggest waste of money and time I have encountered. I started the process over a year ago and I have never got a call from them. Ive had to call them and everytime its something different never straight answer. I was put under a payment plan (I could have doe myself) lost my job needed payment reduced ,was told they would contact IRS that following Monday, That next week came no call, no email nothing called them that Friday..(was told it would be the next month before they would call.) received letter last week have one month to pay in full... Thanks for no help, money I paid yall could of paid IRS..  Its sad you cant TRUST no one.<//Review>

It's unfortunate you were not truthful when you gave the original information.   To be off by over $2K in income makes a big difference and in your case was the difference between qualifying and not qualifying.

<review>If you are looking for help, are looking at the wrong company. My journey started with so called platinum tax defenders just over a year ago. At first the communication is spot on. Then they tell you it takes months to get a resolution. After a few months they say oh well sorry your account was suspended because after numerous attempts to contact you we sent a letter. On my end no letter and zero communication from this company. They don't even hire a so called attorney to help you. I'm not even sure if they have accreditations. They never follow up and don't expect any kind of response. I have tried numerous times to reach any one without any response for weeks. Robert Stevens is the director of operations and doesn't know what's going on within the company and has yet to contact back after many phone calls. I started a process to file a complaint with the BBB and his response was a complete lie. Amazing how they say one thing on email to someone and something else on the phone if you are lucky enough to get any kind of responce. The most important thing with advertisement and business relationships now with all the technology they don't realize is the internet. I will and mr. Stevens don't expect anything less, leave a Google review every single day so as many people as possible are warned about your company as possable. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE NOT WHO THEY SAY!!!!!!

Another thing that is the most impressive is the fact that they want to treat and talk down to everyone the way they do and troll the internet and respond to reviews so quickly to attempt to save face by saying it's "slander" but yet I still haven't received any calls. If you would like and are thinking of using this company I will gladly print out my phone records to prove what I say and post that as well. We have asked many times to send any kind of transcripts to show what they have done and yet not response.
We file a complaint and they respond to that with false accusations. And they come up with who knows what. Mr. Roberts you made a deal with me and didn't hold your end of the bargain. The deal was that you refund my money and we cut ties and I will take down the reviews. I will constantly post on the internet so everyone knows about you until you keep up with what you say.
Before you hire this company go ahead and do your research. Ask for there bar association ID. I haven't been able to find one!!!
I have called several times and a gentleman by the name of Peter doesn't even know who Mr Robert Stevens is.....
I have requested to speak with the owner or CEO of the company with out anyone telling me who that person is ether.
They say one thing and do another!!!!

They got me with false advertisment don't let it happen to you.

At this point I'm willing to bet they have people in the so call company making fake accounts to post good reviews.</review>< Response>
{'time': 1519353820047, 'text': "It's a shame that you are not presenting the facts.  Mr. and Mrs. Hicks requested our service to assist with their tax liability. After signing up with us they failed to respond to multiple emails and telephone calls, and failed to provide/complete the documents we repeatedly requested. Months after we suspended their case, Mr. Hicks called us and stated that he was about to be garnished because he was so far out of compliance with the tax authorities. We advised him of all of the calls and emails that were made to him and that his case had been suspended. Mr. Hicks then stated that he does not check email often and provided his wife's email address. We waived the contractually required reinstatement fee and immediately restarted working on their case. Mr. and Mrs. Hicks are now presenting the situation in a completely different way. The only reason that the Hicks are in this tax situation and the basis of their complaint is completely grounded in their refusal to take responsibility for their own actions. A tremendous amount of work has been completed on this case and no refund is due. In fact they owe us a significant amount of money which we will pursue.\n\nRobert Stevens"}< /Response>

Platinum Tax Defenders is the one and only professional tax defense representation company that I would ever use or refer to others.  It took a couple of years because the IRS dragged it's feet every step of the way during my OiC case progression, but ultimately, Platinum Tax Defenders got my case settled, and the fees I paid them were well worth it.  The owner Sherri is one of the most gracious and kind people I've ever met and we always looking to refer people to her company....  Don't ever hesitate to contact us at any time for more details, we are happy to share out experience, and it was just so empowering and such a relief to get our lives back...Joshua and Eric von Goerken< /text>

I should have checked hear first and I would have not gone with them. They took 1,900 and did nothing and then had the nerve to say they would send me to collections after 4 months . When they sent me a letter saying they could no longer represent me. I’m calling the California attorney general office. I have a fraud lawyer filling a lawsuit. I’m also calling the California BAR ASSOCIATION and filing a complaint with them !</Text>

Talking with Randy R. and his quisling Emily (x 127) was worse than dealing with the IRS. Just as rude and arrogant but w/ zero interpersonal communication skills. Commission based tools hustling you for your routing number. Take your business elsewhere.</Review>

We sent you a cancellation letter and you have yet to return it.  To be clear, we had already reached out to the IRS on your behalf and would be happy to provide you the information that we found.    I looked into our phone system and show that you were spoken to many times.  I'm not sure where the miscommunication is.  Please reach out to us at 800-991-6247.

We simply had a great time.  The restaurant offers either self parking or valet service.  Self parking rate was more than reasonable.</text>< userid>

The food is great! The lobster and noodles are amazing. The service is just lacking. They take a while to check on you,  they're not very organized and getting drinks after your initial order is nearly impossible. If they step it up service-wise they get 5 stars easily!< /Review>

This is like the ugly red headed stepchild of the original New Port Seafood in the SGV. The dishes are sold at a premium, they are smaller, and they don't taste as good. The only pro is that parking is easy and affordable for the area. The decor is really nice but you can certainly tell that this place is catered to a certain demographic (wealthy and non-Asian).<//Review></record>

Scrumptious food! You have not tried chinese food until you come to this place. One of my favorite dishes was the Deep Fried tofu, it was so soft and tasty.</Review>

Me & mom went to Newport seafood in Beverly hiss to  Service was very nice I really really loved the chicken with Chinese broccoli and garlic my mom really did not like the clam  if you do not like clams do not try it.  if you have a lot of people you should get the large order of their yummy delicious crab with a lot of the crab eggs get a a lot of rice in a bowl and scoop up the nice crab sauce on the bottom of the crab when you eat the crab make sure you get a fork and put out gently without having the crabmeat fall apart .  If you really love fried food you should try to start and pepper calamari and the salt-and-pepper shrimp.  I am the fried tofu with a dipping sauce.  You should get there early before the big lunch  enjoy Newport seafood in Beverly Hills

The worst service in LA we have seen in the last 10 years. They tried hard to sale "larger" lobster and crab after you place the order.<//review>< pics>

OK. They have it down. I came for the 2nd time and couldn't pass up on the shrimp and grits one more time. Off the charts. Usually, the 2nd time isn't as good. This time, even better.< /Text>

I came in expecting the same Newport experience that you get in Rowland Heights, but unfortunately this one caters more to a "your own portion" crowd (i.e. not chinese family style serving plates).  The portion sizes are smaller, and it's more expensive, but that is what you get when you get a Rowland Heights eatery and put it into the 90210.
I wouldn't really recommend it UNLESS you can't make it out to alhambra, San Gabriel, or Rowland Heights for cheaper and better quality chinese food.< /text>

I hate to leave negative reviews, but this is the worst Ulta location I’ve ever been to by far :/
First off, they are consistently out of stock on so many items, in so many departments. I would say that 3/4 times I go in for what I need, and walk out empty handed - so frustrating.
Secondly , the cashier/payment/waiting-in-line part is just awful. It seems they never have enough cashiers up front, and the transactions always seem to take forever. It is painfully slow and again, so frustrating.
On a positive note, they do have a good amount of employees on the floor when you need help/have questions.  The employees seem to always have good knowledge of the product they’re recommending to me; I’ve never felt I was being sold on and item they didn’t know or recommend personally, which I appreciate!
Overall, I just wish the store inventory and pay process wait time was better at this location.< /Text>

I had never had my hair done at Ulta, but I'm so happy with the results.  Ashers is really nice and pays a lot of attention to the detail. I am super happy!!</text>

Would have given 5 stars but every time I do an online order for another family member they always have it in the wrong pick up box and we have to go through all the pick packages to find it. Otherwise the staff are great and location is easy to get to.</Text>

Placed a couple of orders online and within 4 hours, they were ready for pick up! Even through the busy Christmas season! Came right in and picked my items plus a few more eye catching items and was out the door in no time. 🤗<//Review>

Mixed experiences, depends on what you need and who you encounter.  I recently had a pleasant experience when I was shopping for a hairdryer.  I am accustomed to the better lines of hairdryers, so I had a price point in mind.  As I was browsing the selection, a salon rep approached me and asked if she could help.  Based on my request, she helped me understand the terminology between the different models, and what might be best for my hair.  Then she asked what my budget was, and did in fact help me stick to my budget, which I sincerely appreciated.  I hate being up-sold.
On other visits I've felt less helped and at times steered toward more expensive items than I wanted to get.  So all in all it's a mixed bag.
Once in a while when they have sales on the brand-name items you can get a pretty good deal.  I also like taking advantage of using my Ulta Rewards points toward purchases.  The cashiers are usually helpful to tell me if/when my points are going to expire so I can use them.  The rewards points have taken some serious $$ off of my total when I've let them accumulate.</Text>

I came in yesterday around 4:30 pm. I was shocked by the extreme lack of decency displayed by this particular cashier. She left me mid-transaction, didn't bother to greet me or say 'Have a nice day!' or even give me a receipt. While she was helping the next customer, I had to ask her for it. Throughout the entirety of our short exchange, she seemed to barely register I was there. She simply scanned my item and then disregarded me by immediately looking into the opposite direction and saying 'I can help the next customer.' Um, I know I'm only buying one item but at least have the decency to finish the transaction or act even mildly friendly. This kind of treatment is appalling. As a cashier, a brand representative of Ulta, it is incredibly tasteless to simply scan my item and move swiftly onto to the next guest without even a word of acknowledgement. Incredibly rude. Please teach your staff not to treat the customer as if they're worthless, busy or not. It makes me not want to ever go back.<//text>

I frequently visit ulta I wouldnt say this location was terrible however, not one sales associate asked if I needed help. The cashier was extremely sweet but its discouraging to walk into a place that you enjoy without an experience to brag about< /Text>

My wife usually brings me in here at least once a week. They are very friendly at this location compared to san ramon and Concord (where they are a bit rude and treat us like we are stealing). Today we came in to talk to the salon staff about getting my wifes roots dyed and re-greenafied (that's right I did that) Ashers helped us out and was very helpful and friendly and ever brought up their promotions! We booked an appointment on the spot! Both ladies were very nice and we will forsure return!<//review>

Cons: shelves were not as well stocked as they should have been. They were out of many shades of Anastasia eyebrow pencils, for example. Worst of all, there was only 1 cashier, so I had to wait about 10 minutes with only 3 people ahead of me. The cashier was apologetic and very courteous, and obviously overwhelmed. I felt bad for her.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

If she hadn't been the manager of the store, rather just a regular employee, I probably would have overlooked these flaws and never comented online but a manager has no excuse for either of these issues.  Deeply frustrated. Won’t be going a back to this Ulta.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Rate>

<Text>I do not go into stores like Ulta very often. I find them intimidating and overwhelming. When I visited this location I thought the building was very clean and organized, the staff was friendly and helpful. I think the prices are higher than if you went to Target but they do have a lot of merchandise which is kind of fun to browse through if you have the time.< /Text>< response>

Going shopping here was like going shopping with a toddler after two shots of espresso and a Mountain Dew backer.

You walk in looking like a walking train wreck "EVERYONE BERATE HER BECAUSE SHE NEEDS US!"

You walk in with a face beat better than Mayweather "EVERYONE BERATE HER WITH SOMETHING EXPENSIVE!"

I understand that your corporate divisions give you unrealistic sales goals, but leave the shoppers alone! We didn't fumble out of Narnia and have no idea what we're doing, we don't care what your managers insist on selling, we just want to shop!<//Review>

Store didnt look very clean or straighten in days. Try calling this store 2days in row kept ringing and ringing.  Once someone pick up they hung this happened several times. Try calling Bayfair store see if I could get some help with the Dublin store. They couldn't be bother. Customer service is terrible especially if they cant even pick up. Yes I know about retail did it for 25 yrs plus. No excuse for this what so ever.<//Review>

I was able to find a shampoo product that I couldn’t find at Walmart, Target and a local beauty supply shop.

It was pristine on the inside and had a large selection of lower priced items and expensive items as well, like a $250 hair dryer with 36 speeds.</review>

<Text>This should be a 5, but ULTA has been building smaller stores with a much more narrow and limited manufacturer selection.
Bummer!
If you're in a big city you'll get the whole experience with many brands, some very high end, and their full product line.
The best part is the service.  They have a hair salon, mani-pedis,  and make-up artists who know the good make-up lines. They'll be happy to show you how to update your look with the very latest products!<//Text>< pics>

Came in on a Wednesday Afternoon. No sales rep to help match my foundation or help me with a question regarding location of a palette I was looking for . I waited 20 minutes for them to tell me their only help was the manager and she was busy with another customer. Not very good customer service. This is why I rather go to Sephora .< /text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>PLEASE save your time and money by NOT coming here. I called two locations to see if a palette was in stock and they all said no, then I called this location and they clearly said word for word "Yes, we have a ton of palettes and have had them in stock since 2 days ago". Once I showed up the next day they said they never had that palette in stock and that if I called and they said they had it I should have ordered it. What kind of logic is that? I clearly call to check if something is in stock and they tell me yes only to show up and have them tell me no. Wasted my time and I hope to prevent that from happening to someone else.< /Text>< Pictures>

Absolutely horrible service.  Went to take my daughter for her birthday and no one would help us.   Went to Nordstrom and we were treated like queens.< /Review>

I was never very interested in make up, but that soon changed when my boyfriend recommended it to make me feel good about myself, to feel and look beautiful, and increase my self-confidence, I've come to ulta several times within the past few months and being at Ulta has definitely done it all for me, Hannah was my make up artist the first time I came here and we very quickly became friends, she seemed to love what she was doing, and sharing her art with me, I felt very cared about, the best part about my experience was her friendly and optimistic, warm and welcoming personality, and that is why I have become a regular customer here, not only Hannah, but all the employees here have given me similar treatment, they seem like a great team and family who love what they do and I can't resist wanting to be a part of that atmosphere, I not only feel cared about as a customer, but I feel at home, I've gotten to know some great people that work here, Kejon is a great guy and has a very friendly and welcoming personality, you can always expect a bright smile, and he has a heart of gold, he's always been very accommodating, and having some anxiety I can always look forward to coming here because I feel respected, valued, and understood, Juanita has been my hairstylist and always does a fantastic job, no matter how I'm feeling coming here always puts a smile on my face, and I know the team here really cares because they always seem happy to help me the whole way through :) thank you so much for all you've done! Your amazing!<//text>

Ulta carries a huge selection of both drugstore and high-end cosmetics. The store is usually very busy on weekends. The checkout line is long and weaves through aisles of shoppers, which can get crowded.< /Text>

I never write reviews and it takes a lot to actually irk me but I had the worst experience I’ve had in awhile with a department store.

I’ve been looking forward to a particular line that launched today, and I called prior to make sure they had the main items I wanted in stock. They assured me they had the whole line in stock and I went in shortly after to purchase.

When I got there, a few items where missing but it was a very small display unit so I figured maybe they had more and just hadn’t had time to re stock. I look around and I don’t see anyone to ask. I waited about ten or so minutes before I’m finally “helped.”

When asked about the stock the lady tells me “oh...no of course we don’t have more this is one of the most highly anticipated collections of the Spring.”

I was so put off I left immediately. I didn’t mind ordering a few products online, but I took my 200 dollar purchase right over to Sephora in the Stoneridge Mall. It’s funny because when I inquired the same question at Sephora I was told “oh yeah the display is sooo small, so it’s hard to keep track of stock so I’ll check for you!”

Simple courtesy goes a long way. I work retail and I know what it’s like to have hot items or be out of something. There’s a right way to tell someone and not berate them. Will not be returning to this location ever.</Text>

<text>I'm so frustrated because it's been about 5 times now that I have gone in and came out with used products that are being sold on display. That will be the last time I purchase anything from ulta in Dublin. I'd rather drive the extra 15 to go to sephora in the mall than have to drive to ulta twice for every purchase ...< /text>< Pictures>

<userid>106017822017912787955< /userid><review>No Customer Service or care.  Booked an appt online for 5:30p - recvd a call asking if I could come in earlier.  Advised that I was not in town but would call when I was close to ask if I they still wanted me to come in early.  I called at 4:50 and was told come on in.  Got there - was asked 5 different times who I was there - explained once again that the system had my husbands name as we share an email address.  I could tell Stephanie was uncomfortable with my question - so I asked is Angelina not available until 5:30p.  She responded she's in a meeting.  What?!  Why tell me its ok to come on over - why ask me if I can come in earlier.  She then proceeded to offer to wash my hair for 20 min.  No thanks I'll take my business elsewhere.  Told them go ahead and cancel my husbands appt to - you've lost 2 paying customers.</review>< name>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Came in to look for a lightweight foundation that didn't make me look busted after work. I was interested in Clinique just wasn't sure which one would be right. I've tried a ton of foundations but never Clinique. I was referred by an employee to Ariel who was the "Clinique girl" if you will. And honestly she was amazing!!! I don't have the best skin due to bad acne in HS. And she did everything to help. She listened to what worried me and what I was looking for. She recommended me to a foundation gave me a few tips and made me fall in love with the clarifying lotion. I went in thinking this should be fun(sarcasm). And it actually was. She's like the friend who isn't annoying and is super likable and good at what she does. The experience I had was outstanding that I had called back a few days later to see if I could talk to Ariel and ask her what products she used on my face because I had never had my face feel so clean and soft the girl who answered took my info down and told me Ariel would call me. A days later I got a call from Ariel and she asked if I wanted to come in for a facial and would go over the products she used on my skin so I agreed because who's going to turn down a free facial LOL. When I came in she remembered who I was sat me down took all my make up off prepped my skin gave me the best facial ever I looked silly in the store though but it literally made my skin feel so amazing this girl definitely sold me on Clinique products and was able to give me some generous samples as well I just want to say thank you to Ariel and thank you to ulta for hiring Ariel!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

False advertising! There were two signs indicating that if you spent $35.00 on Tarte cosmetics you would receive a free mascara. When I got to the register, the cashier did not honor it, saying it was an old sign and had an attitude about it. Not going back to shop here again.<//text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Ordered a pizza at 6:35pm on Friday 5/14, at 8:10pm I still did not receive anything. Once I called, I spoke to someone who was rude and told me to call back tomorrow to speak to a manager and that I couldn't receive a refund. I called once again and asked who I was speaking to, the person ignored my question a few times. When I asked to whom I was speaking to for about the third time he spoke to me in Spanish thinking I wouldn't understand. So I asked in Spanish and finally got my answer. His name is Edgar and I asked him to process my refund because I no longer wanted my order. I do hope he indeed process my refund, if not I will be calling back in two days. Probably one of the worst customer service interactions I've had so far with Domino's.< /Review>< pics>

Julio, our delivery guy, was amazing!!! There was some mis communication from the person taking the order and he ended up a block away. So not Julios fault. He was kind, apologetic, accommodating and just a complete sweetheart. I've had this Domino's app for a good 2 years. I've never had this issue but Julio handled it very professionally!! Kudos to him!!!!!!! Im just very disappointed that I was not allowed to provide my feedback AFTER it was delivered. I wanted to give 5 stars across the board, even after the mishap but was DENIED the ability. Julio made it right and for that, I am grateful. Thank you Julio!!! You are a rock star!!!</text>

<text>The Delivery drivers are by far the most friendliest and extremely fast and the same can be said about the rest of the employee's.. This is my go to SPOT for pizza (ordered it about 40 times the past year) and It is by far the Best PRICE  (the deals are by far the best) as well as tasting pizza locally.   The pizza almost always has a ton of cheese and toppings. I would have given this location  a 5 star rating but My last visit had a new manager and it took about 30 minutes (in total) of talking and waiting (the pizza and the sandwich was ready so it got cold) for the new manager to be able to adjust the price at the register to honor the websites deal. The pizza was the quality I have received from other locations and Pizza hut, meaning it was basic and plain as well as VERY cold (the "HOT" sandwich included).

The new manager did her job and honored the deal (2 items for 5.99 each, plus extra $ for pan pizza and double meat on the sandwich which was extra as well) but had to figure out how to ring it up at the register..
JUST TO BE CLEAR.... THE WEBSITE WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO ADD DOUBLE MEAT ON THE SANDWICH And she did all she could to resolve the situation. But the pizza and sandwich was still cold and the pizza lacked the cheese, toppings (5 pepperoni only and a ton of sauce was showing on Every slice) and thickness of the crust for a pan pizza. This was over 2 weeks ago and I have NOT tried them again yet. I will test it out again and give an update as to how it was. I have faith it was a 1 time thing..<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

For the first time ever my pizza was dry even the cheese was dry it was so dried out that I couldn't even tell if it had extra cheese. It looked like it was sitting for a while. I'll try another location next time what a waste of $20<//Text>

I order online like always do
Paid for order and delivery and
Guess what?!..
...They can't deliver an order that is already paid for because they called and nobody answer.
Are you serious?
call the store and they say " we can't deliver your pizza because you left a note that says " knock at door and leave it a door"." What are those notes for then. I had my family waiting on some pizzas that never got home. Very disappointed at dominos. It really make no sense why they wouldn't deliver a order that is been paid off.
Go for papa johns or pizza hut they do deliver orders you pay for.< /Review>< pics>

Purchased food from this business about 2 two weeks ago. Employees don't wear gloves or hair nets. Food took way to long to be made. Before I arrived to establishment I was calling for 20 minutes employees don't answer the phone. Ordered my food and was told it was going to take 50 minutes so I waited. About 40 minutes went by I went in btw I was parked directly in front of the store. I asked employee was my food ready he said no. Five minutes later went in got my food went back to my car open pizza box took a slice out and the damn food was cold. Ordered bread twists and bread was undercooked taste like dough. I will never spend my money here again.<//text>

7/18/19. So I'm updating my review. This location needs to improve their quality control.  They rush to make pizzas and dont look pay attention to the special instructions.  I ordered a pizza with no oregano. So why did they make it with oregano???. They offered to make me a new pizza but I told them that I don't have 15 minutes to wait.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1560877651913, 'text': "Hello Marco, we would like to sincerely apologize for the negative experience you had with us.

Always on time.  Sincere driver in our area.
Sure, there’s plenty of other pizzerias around here, as afterall, it’s South Bay of Southern California!

But when time is of essence, and on-time, and predictable, safe, reliable catering is needed, this particular Dominos just gets it done.  Every time.
A piece of mind when it’s spur of the moment.</review>

When I eat pizza its usually at pizza hut but  decided to give Domino's  a try. I'm glad I did the food was great & hot. I ordered for delivery and my pizza got here in a reasonable time. The prices are a little expensive though I got the $8.99 medium pizza deal & added extra cheese & it came out to $15. So that's the only complaint I have is with the price. I would of gave 5 stars if they had better prices because  $6 more for extra cheese is outrageous!  Well minus the $2  or $2.99 delivery charge even $4 or $3 more for extra cheese is to much. I think it's should cost like 50cents or a dollar at most for extra cheese maybe $2 but that's still pushing it.<//text>

<Time>1520575292770<//Time><Review>The pizza itself is better than other domino around hawthorne. However, I ordered the pizza and came to pick it up today because it was ready on internet. When I arrive there, they even didn’t start to cook my pizza. They told me because of system error. Ok, it is system error but I didn’t understand that why who order later than me picked up the order first? Also, they didn’t say sorry or something. Just blaiming about system and seems like even didn’t care. I wasted literally 25mins in front of store and it was amazing experience.

<review>This location has a very professional and friendly staff that helpd me through a terrible 45min. Dominos experence. The dominos on Redondo beach Blvd. Refused to take my order and deliver me pizza because I'm "outside of their zone" (0.8 miles away). I order from them at least twice a month, but apparently I'm outside of both stores "delivery zones". The manager told me "call Crenshaw and have them tell me themselves that they don't deliver to you"...why can't the store on Redondo beach Blvd. have good service like this dominos?<//review>< pictures>

She sighed loudly. When I got my pizza, it arrived cold, almost frozen. I looked at him, and he said it was burnt. I guess hes only in it for the money. Not only was it cold, THERE WAS A BITE TAKEN OUT OF IT. I guess he got a little hungry on the way here. I stared at him in awe, and he ran away with my money AND the pizza. wow. I am never ordering from dominoes again, because all of them fell. Now looking back at it, he was probably a homeless guy who wanted my money and pizza for he had no uniform. Still disappointed in you, dominoes.< /text>< pics>

They don't care about customer service.they need completely new management.post the past year it's been bad service. They over cook the pizza. So I just go to Chuck e cheese now when I'm in the mood for pizza.</Review>< pics>

< review>
Generally, this store has pretty poor service. They quite often show orders as "delivered" before they actually arrive. I have received orders on multiple occasions that were missing items.

The worst part is that their customer service has a very uncaring attitude when called. Typically you will get a "I'm sorry, there is nothing we can do" or a "you'll get your items soon."

....like really?!? your tracker says you delivered it, how about we go back to the part where you click the "delivered" button when you actually deliver it? I don't think it is ethical to wait another 20 minutes after I "received" my pizza< /review>

< review>
I just ordered a pizza  told it would arrive an hour and 40min later OK two hours later I call to see if pizzas on way the tell me they realized they don't deliver to my address and canceled the order but for some reason they didn't think it necessary to call me and let me know so the feeling  of sitting and waiting 2hrs for a pizza that's been canceled is beyond unacceptable<//review>

<review>They had some hiking shoes I was looking for (other locations didn't have the size I needed in stock) so that was a major, major plus! Great customer service and good selection. Clean inside. I wish I got the name of the guy that helped me because he was super helpful! Make sure to sign up for Big 5 promos since it knocked a few $ from the total. This is now going to be my Go-to location when I need shoes!! Cheers!< /review><time>1618162911985< /time><Rating>5</Rating>< gmap_id>

Went there to do some last minute Christmas shopping. Taking that into consideration, the store was surprisingly organized & clean. The staff are on it. They were very helpful & friendly. Also a great location.</review>

<Text>I experienced disappointment in a couple areas. A sale price advertised was not valid. Sales are advertised. However,  when the item is purchased,  you are given the original price. This is a pattern. You must return to the store for the correction to be made. Since that is usually an inconvenience,  you never receive the advertised price. Also,  calling ahead to get clarification is futile. I  called ahead looking for a specific item. The item was not available  and was never available. Rather than the Manager educating or informing his employees of error, he did nothing to remedy this problem. Not only did I call, when I asked for the product, an employee walked me to the item he believed to be the correct item.  The Manager heard me ask the cashier for the item that is not available. He did nothing.  When I told Manager that an employee said the item was available,  he said she lied. That was the cashier who rang up my purchase. That's unprofessional in my view.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<review>Staff is always friendly but I've ran into a guy who seems to be a manager a couple times, who always has a bad attitude and just brushes away your questions or acts annoyed that you don't know the answer already. This has happened to me, my wife and my friend in separate occasions.</review><rating>2< /rating>< Response>

<review>Called first. Then went into store. Requested Gentleman who advised on phone. Had to request him twice. Once as i entered Store, then once again in the department, little short guy just was to pushy against person requested.  I waited then this very Tall ,  Handsome, and knowledgeable about the phone call.  He was immediately aware of my interest.  Then carried it to counter. To check out..I am very pleased with my purchase.</review>< Pictures>

I wouldn't come here if your African American. came here and within 5 minutes of telling the guy I wanted to buy ammo the young guy at the ammo counter said he couldn't sell to me because i "looked high". I was pretty upset but I already knew what was going on so just went to the big 5 in Cerritos. I'd advise my African-American brothers and sisters to avoid this big 5.</Text>

<review>Always a great place to find what I need. Whether it's work shoes, gym stuff (chalk, plate clips, weightlifting belt) or other items, they have a good selection of well, goods. I even picked up a nice pool stick that wasn't expensive once. Staff is helpful and courteous anytime I go.</review></record></dataset><record>

Horrible customer service by the manager ( big guy with a beard). I walked in and he was behind the counter makes eye contact and fails to greet me. I stand there assuming he is busy and is helping another customer on the other side of the store. Nope he was just hunched over the counter doing nothing till he gets a page to assist a cashier. He then walks away and doesn't say anything to me standing at the counter. Another employee walks by greets and asks if I need help. I ask for assistance with an ammo purchase. He says I can only be helped by the manager and pages him to come back. Now it's been 15 minutes if standing there with no assistance. I finally got his lazy unwilling to help manager to answer some questions I had. Answered all of my questions with an I don't want to sell a thing to you attitude so I left. He could have definitely done more to make a sale as other associates there would have and for that I would never go back. I will be contacting their corporate office on Monday.</Review>

I stopped in last night to check out the 1-day deals. I asked for help and Regan sprang into action. She was friendly, knowledgeable and patient. I ended up shopping around and found a comfy pair of running shoes! I’ll be back soon!👍🏾<//Review>

Went to pickup my shotgun which is within my timeframeto pick up and was waiting at the counter after speaking to a manager to get assistance at gun counter stood there for about 15min with no assistance and then when they finally came to help because it takes too long they wouldnt release my gun after 530 even though it was ready to go! Now theyre making me come back the next day! what kind of bull is that! Horrible customer service< /Text>

It was a nice experience.  They always have good deals on shoes. The person working the shoes, that was person, even though he was working alone, he gave the best service.  There was a frustrated elderly man there, who had been looking all day for a good pair of shoe, for his aching foot condition, and the person helping him took the time to help him and listen to him, even as he had others waiting. My heart went to the man. In the end, he didn't achieve his goal but he was so grateful for the help he received,  he thanked the salesman and went on his way.
Prices: I saved over 50% on my purchases today, wow!< /review>

I'm African-American and have been there several times and have yet to be offered any help.  However, I noticed the staff was helpful and attentive to Caucasian customers.

Your a sporting goods place shouldn't a manager that can release firearms be on duty at all times? Maybe it was because I had my black step father with me? Lady was rude and told me to come back tomorrow and make sure I call beforehand because theirs nothing she can do? What kind of service is that? I'll never be shopping here again.<//review>< Date>

Good selection for the size of the space.  It was difficult to identify items that were advertised by signage as ON SALE due to the items directly above/below/around those displayed signs not being the brands mentioned in the signs posted.  The only employee I encountered was on checkout (possibly understaffed for the time period I was there).</review>

Old business.  Been around as long as I can remember.  Much like other big 5's I have been to there's a ton of stuff crammed into a small area.  Gives a disorganized feeling.   Workers were OK but didn't offer anything unless asked. It's like the Wal-Mart of sporting goods stores.< /Text>

<Review>Big 5 usually always has good deals on everything. Although sometimes little things will be overpriced. Other than that. Great place to get all you sports and outdoor stuff.< /Review>< Pics>

Lots of variety products having little to do with sports and not well stocked in the areas of sporting goods.  Staff, (cashier) loves calling you "boss" if you're of color.  Observe for yourself...</Text>

Not very organized. I know I looked like I was trying to find what I was looking for (because I couldn't) and two different employees walked right by me and didn't even acknowledge my existence.
When I took my two yoga mats to the register, a lady was trying to use a coupon on her phone which wasn't working correctly. They were waiting for a manager. I finally had to ask the girl at the register if there was another register available. She looked at me and the couple of people who had also now stood behind me in line and said "yeah" and called for another person. That chick wasn't very polite, but she wasn't rude. She was just there and sold me my mats. And called the next person before she even handed me my receipt.< /Review>

The problem that I keep seeing is that they don't have enough people working the floor. Particularly the shoe area. There was a line 5 deep just to get shoes from the back with only 2 guys working. Waited a half an hour and gave up. Also the aisles are messy with equipment and product strewn all over the floor. They need more employees especially on the weekends.</text>

Can't beat Big 5 for prices or products! This is a pretty big store and it's laid out logically. Workers there are what you'd expect for minimum wage, I've never run into anybody grumpy or unwilling to help though. They usually have exactly what I've gone in there for.< /Review>
