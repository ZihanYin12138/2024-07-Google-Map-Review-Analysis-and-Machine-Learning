Stay clear of this place. Rude staff, very expensive and designed to get as much cash from you as possible.

The level of the actual massage and service was not good. The Massause had a poor attitude, wasn’t good at massaging and the whole experience was very poor.

I would urge anyone to stay clear. Trust me you will regret spending your cash here.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) It's the worst.
I was tired and paid 70 dollars in an hour to get a massage, but this was like a prostitute, and I received a relentless sale from a Thai woman during massage.
I didn't feel like that at all, so if I refused it many times, I went out in the middle of the time.
The shopkeeper was like half an hour, so I was able to return half the price, but I couldn't accept it stubbornly.
I wanted to call the police to detect prostitution, but I gave up because the flight time was approaching.
People who are purely for massage should never go.

最悪です。
疲れていたのでマッサージをしようと思い1時間で70ドル払いましたが、ここは売春店のようで、マッサージ中タイ人女から執拗な売り込みを受けました。
そんな気は全くないので何度も断ると、時間半ばで出行ってしまいました。
店主らしきおっさんに時間半分だから半額返せと粘りましたが、頑なに受け付けられず。
警察を呼んで売春を摘発してもらおうと思いましたが、その後フライトの時間が迫っていたので断念しました。
純粋にマッサージ目的の人は絶対行かない方がいいと思います。</Review>< Pictures>

I'm a regular at this restaurant and I've had mixed experiences in the past. I went in there few nights ago as I was craving some good fish and chips. The food was excellent this time around and I've noticed new owners running the restaurant. I hope to come back again soon next time I'm craving some good seafood.< /text>

I call this excellent place often since I love the special air that is unique to this restaurant. The staff is highly attentive and well trained. The service is absolutely rapid. Needless to say, the food you get is great. I have been there many times and I was always happy. The price is honest. I suggest this place to to everybody.<//Review>

You know when you have that certain food urge. That was me today for some fish and chips. I was there when they opened. Very small restaurant, but the service was outstanding. They were quick and they were very nice. The fish and chips were good and I loved the prawns. I will be back for sure.<//Review>

Local seafood place close to home. I love going here for their Seafood combo and also their chicken teriyaki with fried rice they normally give steamed rice but since I'm a regular I get to substitute for the fried rice. Very yummy!</Text>

What little find.... a small hole in the wall, I may have never walked in if a friend had not told me, I've been a few times now, and have not been disappointed. Everything is made fresh, I had Basa, prawn and fries , fresh nicely fried,  not greasy, the breading on the prawn is a thick  crunchy crust, well seasoned.. I've also had the teriyaki prawn w/rice and salad, typical iceberg lettuce salad,  but it was really fresh and crunchy, just tasty,  the teriyaki prawns were delish.... cant wait to go back and try something else... YUM!!< /Review>

Fish was soggy, soft and unseasoned. The breading was also coming off and the sliced bread was stale.< /Review>

At its peak, this was one of the coolest spots in Sacramento to kick it. When I first heard this place was closing, it made me feel sad. However I realized that times have changed. Hopefully one day they reinvent themselves and reoccupy this cool location.</review>

<Text>It's is a bit pricey for the location. It used to be a very good place too eat. The restaurant has really gone down hill. The rooms have sleep number beds which is nice, but, if you get a room on the back side of the hotel, Costco is on the other side of the fence and you'll hear trucks coming and going all night. The rooms walls are very thin as well. They have a small casino on premise and the hotel lobby and common areas are very nice.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Grounds are beautiful, very expansive.  Our room was clean, outside noise was not at all an issue.  Food was very good.  The only negative is the location of ice/vending machines, but if you don't mind walking a bit, not a big issue.  I would stay again.<//Review>

We were provided wireless mics that worked great and a sound system to plug our devices into. Some attendees complained after a whole it was too cold in the room with the AC blasting and soon after..it was turned off and the rest of the meeting the temperature was good.<//review>< Pics>

The staff was nice a friendly, our room was "okay" we had to ask to switch rooms because didn't seem they cleaned out our room. Again, staff was kind and friendly to move us to another room (which we appreciate). This room was clean, our kids had fun swimming in the pool and we enjoyed walking around the entire property (huge property). Really liked walking to the Koi pond and taking pictures. Will stay again.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

All rooms faced a lovely lake, pool and courtyard. There was a large out door hot tub by the pool as well.  The food I took out from the restaurant was fresh and well prepared... Caesar salad, cheese quesadilla and burger. We ate by the pool in a lovely relaxed atmosphere. Rooms were clean and staff was sweet,professional and helpful.

3 star to 3.5 stars if it had room service runner  on golf cart be nice. On-Site laundry would be nice or Pick up room runners and press and foild service. Your guys listening up date plugs, patch wholes correctly and update lighting this place is an easy 4 star hotel< /text>

I was in room 351. The walls are paper thin and after being so put off by the very vocal couple next door, I requested a room change. Jacob at the front desk was excellent with the change. My new room was 183 and was perfect.</review>

< Review>
The rooms were musty, nasty, and dingy overall. I got sick just breathing in the room. The place really needs to be torn down as the real estate could be used to build a good hotel or something. I understand that investors want to monetize as long as they can on their properties but in the hotel industry where folks health and well being is at stake, its better to rebuild or try another method other than just milking all you can out of a property when its long been time to shut it down.Eventually the word will get out and most people will not want to stay there …well Quality people anyway.</Review>

This is an OK hotel. You can tell it used to be really nice in its hay day,  but has since fallen to age. The pond is pretty cool, but you can hear the fountain all night and it's not the usual pleasant sound of water.</Text>

<Review>I would pay 60 dollars a night, at most,  for this hotel. The lobby is nice, but that's it. No refrigerator, bag of trash left outside our door, showers rusty and out of date, sleep number bed remote had no batteries, not all of the outlets worked, front desk button on phone didn't work so I called using my phone and got put on hold for a long time. Service, quality, and cleanliness were all lacking for the price paid. This is an economy class stay, think motel 6 or super 8.<//Review>< pictures>

Professional staff,  very nice hotel,  quiet place,  great rates. The rooms have some small problems,  like the fan in the bathroom didn't work,  the light in the small area was tricky to turn on.< /Text>

<Text>I have been to the hotel on several occasions.  The front desk staff is exceptional.  I do not understand how anyone can rate them rude.  Everyone you meet has a smile upon their face from the front desk to the house keepers to the grounds keepers.  I have over heard if a guest had a complaint while waiting, they quickly addressed the problem to the appropriate solution staff immediately to ensure a guest satisfaction at least to my satisfaction that I would expect an immediate response. The private conference rooms are clean and set appropriate to any business meeting needs.  The outside lake setting with the water spouts is comforting to sit by and relax for meditation or a moment just to breath. The pool is crisp and clean. They have a nice little shop, and coffee shop.   The hotel is beautiful,  They have a very romantic, comfortable setting night club and lounge.  The food is beyond exceptional.  I feel they go beyond the call of duty to make your stay enjoyable.  If you smell chemicals know you have a clean room!  Some people have allergies like myself and appreciate no sprays to cover up as it saves on my senses.  I rather know a room is clean.</Text></record>

Close to the Sacramento Expo right off Exposition Blvd. Reasonable rate (discounted because it was the sponsored hotel for an AMA race at the track). Believe me, all the hotels within a 20 minute drive were completely booked that weekend and very expensive because of the MX race and Flat Trak race. Don't wait until the last minute to book reservations and check the events calendar for the days you'll be staying in the area.<//review>

First at check in I change my mind about my two day stay to one, was very difficult and confusing finding place, the man a desk said when I check out tomarrow they would just bill me for one nite.  As I check my bank balance during that same afternoon they had billed me for two notes and plus $75 deposit that is would not get back until 3 to 4 days later... Unbelievable, place is old and dirty, I was given a room in the back bungalows 😡< /Review>

Have stayed here before, it's an older hotel but fairly well kept up. However this time have runbinto some issues, a broken button on the thermostat, power strips that have gotten blown fuses (after being Daisy chained together), as well as the room being rekeyed during the evening causing all our keys not to work in the morning.<//Text>

<text>This place is a JOKE!! The pictures online are soooooo different from what it really is!!  We made reservations for 2 nights, 2 adults 3 kids we requested 2 beds.  First off we thought it was all in close proximity to the pool, boy was I wrong it was a 1/4 mile away from our room!  You hear Red Lion and think nice hotel, no no no not here. The room was so dated the inside of the door was dirty it was so gross!!  The beds were not double beds at all twin maybe!  It smelled so bad like smoke I couldn't even take my kids in there.  We drove back to the front desk (the only nice thing there) because walking is out of the question we asked for a different room they said they were booked and had nothing else. I said it smells like smoke I can't have my baby in that room. The lady said oh I can cancel your room , we did just that .  I then called the credit card company just to
Confirm and guess what charge is still on there thankfully our card company is dealing with it.  We went to the Hyatt which is soooo much better !! If I could give them negative stars I would stay far away!!  And there is no fridge!!! Even cheap hotels have fridges!!</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>This is a wonderful hotel with a beautiful view of a lake.  The staff is very friendly and the cleaning of the rooms are daily.  The rooms are spacious and business grade.  You have free wi-fi, ice, central heating/air, clean linen, adjustable beds (sleep number), coffee maker, alarm clock radio, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soap.  The view of the lake was grand with a fountain, geese on the water, a Koi fish pond with it's own fountain and a nice pathway.  The hotel also has a swimming pool with a safety fence a small amphitheater area with soft music coming through speakers when not in use. There are ice rooms located around the property with soda machines.

The convention rooms are elegant and host many events. There is a Grill that serves and offers room service, a Bar but my favorite is the dining room.  The breakfasts were fresh cooked daily whether it was served or buffet and refilled often.  The morning servers along with the chef and cooks were very friendly and personable. They were my favorite part of the experience not excluding Sylvia at the front desk.

The rooms are very clean along with their bathrooms. Because of the fear of bed bugs in some of the local motels and extended stay hotels this was a pleasant experience. alleviating those concerns. All concerns are addressed immediately (not that there should be any but things can happen).

Do be aware that during the wet season it tended to flood in front of the entrance to the hotel's property. (This might have been addressed by now)

This hotel is a definite Yes and a Must Try.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

The hotel is somewhat dated but has a lot charm. Most of the rooms are facing a large lake with a large water fountain in the middle. Rooms are reasonably large with sleep number beds and the standard ameneties. Good front desk and huskeeping staff. They need to infuse some cash to upgrade it to competative hotels in the area. The hotel is in a strange area but it very close to to downtown, Arden Fair, business 80 freeway and lots of restaurants and shopping. The hotel is a good value, but needs some work.< /Review>

Ok first I don't know where some of these nut jobs were staying, but I have been at this motel for 4 days for work. I am from San Francisco. I have been in construction for most of my life and even a building inspector at one time in the city of San Francisco. I have not seen any evidence that this is anything but a lovely place to stay. There are hundreds of units on the property, so maybe it could be true that there are a few bad ones as the odds are in favor of that. However my co worker who is staying at the Marriott nearby says she wants to stay here  instead. In fact we do work in many high end Hotels for a living. And from what I ave seen, this place is a 3-4 star depending on your taste.< /Review>

The beds are very hard, like the beds use to be in hotels 20 years ago.  With the conferences on weekdays you cannot even park by your room some days.  No refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms unless you want to pay and extra $25/day each.  Not recommended at all.<//review>< pics>

<Review>Dated is an understatement.  Switches, plugs, coffee maker and the sleep number bed sucked... every plug and switch! Room smelled like cigarettes,  and the shower was equivalent to the bathroom sink water. Paid for the "breakfast buffet", was behind someone else getting food and the attendent comes out and says it's not open yet. She says it opens in 10 minutes, and proceeds to give more attitude?< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

This place is terrible. My husband and I were paying for my sister-in-law and her daughter to stay there after their house caught fire. We got our original deal through Hotwire for $68/night. Once that reservation was up, we weren't able to extend at that rate and from there, everything went horribly down hill. They changed the rate every night, ranging from $120 to $165, always with a different excuse. Their website said $79/night weekdays and $109/night on weekends. They explained with different reasons each time why we could not get those rates. The staff was the rudest bunch I have ever encountered and the manager was even worse as we over heard her telling the trainee she was working with "And that's how you do it" after charging us the highest amount they had so far. The morals that staff has is shameful and the Red Lion should be ashamed of this location to the fullest, taking advantage of people the way they are and finding it humorous. Shame on them. We moved our family members to the Best Western HOTEL (not a MOTEL like the Red Lion) in a much nicer neighborhood, much better reviews and a much nicer establishment for $110/night. I'm not sure why we didn't go there first since we travel often and usually stay at one of their establishments, it is the LAST time I will ever go there, I wouldn't stay there if they gave me an entire month free and that is the absolute truth. By the way, I forgot to mention the man a few doors down that had quite a few street prostitutes come back to his room and the cleanliness of the room was sub-par at best.<//Text>

What a dump.  Checked into my room and immediately visited the front desk to get another one.  When I pulled back the covers I found hairs in the sheets and the mattress was a mess.  A sleep number with no working numbers.  This room should have been condemned not rented.  With there was a way to rate this place zero stars.</review>

<text>I reserved a room that would sleep two adults and three kids.  They said "no problem" my room had two full beds in it.  I dont know in what world three kids (two nine year old and a 5 year old) could fit on a full bed.  So i called down to ask for a roll away bed....15 dollars a night extra, and if the room has two beds already, we cant have a roll away bed too.  Are you kidding me? So one of my kids has to sleep on the floor now.  So we unpack our stuff, no fridge! Thats another 15 bucks a night. Ive stayed in tons of hotels in my time in the service, this is the first place ive ever been to that didnt have a fridge in the room, let alone have to pay for it.  I will never stay at one of these places again.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<review>my husband and I were there last week and our experienced to that hotel was a nightmare.   The room we got smelled so badly, it was dirty and filthy.  I wasn't able to use their towel as it seemed it was already used and never been washed.  They even asigned us way at the back of  the hotel where noone had checked in.  OMG that was scary.  If you are trying to check in to Red Lion in Sacramento, think twice!  Don't be deceive by the picture only or the front building because because behind it is so ghetto.<//review>< Pics>

This was one of the worst experiences ever I wish I could show pictures everything from the smell of mold to a clogged sink filthy I mean filthy toilet and bathtub. How can you rent a room in this condition. Do not stay here you will regret it.< /review>

I stayed at Room 106 and paranormal activity went on at around 12-2 where the phone would ring and nobody was there, and my door would open around the same time, some friends also stayed over at Room 105/107 and their TV would turn on randomly, nice hotel, creepy things going on.  dont recommend</Review>

<Text>Probably the worst Red Lion hotel I have ever stayed in.  The carpet in the room is disgusting.  Dirty old couches.  The tv is so low.  I can hear the people next door.
Will never stay here again!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Finally got in ready to relax after a long drive at 11 at night got to our room and it was filthy. Told us they had no other rooms so we would have to stay somewhere else, left to scramble for a room at 11:30 at night.< /review>

My cousin paid for two rooms and we were going to stay the night and swim in the pool. Upon our arrival we found bed bugs in the rooms and promptly left.< /text>

Very clean. Rooms are close together; I could hear the teenage girls next door. Spa didn't work. Blackout drapes were short for the window. Sleep number beds are not my favorite.<//Review>

The staff are super nice, which is why I feel bad giving it only 1 star, but my god this place is a dump. The rooms smell of mildew, they face the outside (motel style), and some of the other guests are a little unsavory. I walked around and smelled a couple people smoking pot and I was driving all the way around the back of the hotel to park next to my room, I saw a couple shady people just loitering...

The pictures look nice and the prices similar to other hotels in the area like the Double Tree by Hilton, suggest it may be nice...but this place is GHETTO!!<//text>

This painting service is great!  We had an interior room with high(18 foot) ceilings, that had water damage and cracks in the Sheetrock.  The drywall was repaired, textured an all walls were painted.  The project manager, Brandon, was very helpful with color selection, and painted several areas for our approval. The crew showed up on time, left the work area neat and cleaned up very well. If you have a painting project in mind, either interior or exterior, give Green Valley a call for an estimate from Them.  They are truly a high quality contractor!</text>

We own a wooden house built in 1936. We bought it about 5 years ago and the place looked good. We found, however, that within 5 years, the paint began to peel, bubble and crack. When a strip about 5 feet long began to curl off we started making calls.  We found Green Valley Painting by talking with a neighbor: we made a call and asked them to come out to give us an estimate. They responded the same day and made the appointment. They were the only one of a group of guys we called to respond quickly and come when they said they would. Ian looked over the house, and came back with a quote within a day. I was impressed with his knowledge, his openness to listening to what we wanted and his understanding of what needed to be done. He said we would be in the pipe line and he would set up time for the painting of the house. They were able to bump our house up in the schedule.
Their work was always timely, of excellent quality and they did what they said they would do within the time that they said they would do it. No hold ups, no delays. The crew was friendly, capable and busy. They arrived early and were on the job working hard.  I trust their work, and their ability to do what was asked for them to do with no shortcuts or changes. They power washed the house, scraped, sanded, caulked, primed, and painted with two coats. They masked everything, took care of our stuff as they worked around the house and left zero mess,  I honestly had no worries and I was completely satisfied with the work that was done. You cannot beat that, in my mind, it's what you hope for in a business and service contract. Ian and his men were awesome. Here are three photos from the work, the original green color and the new blue. People have stopped and commented positively on the work. Thank you GVP.<//Text>

<Text>We just had Green Valley Painting paint the entire interior of our  2100 sf home (walls, ceilings, millworks, doors) as well as do  quite a bit of drywall repair.   It's important to point out that all of our belongings were in place and our home office was operating every day from 8 am to 5 pm. during this process.   The crew did a great job moving and protecting our furniture and keep the dust under control.  They arrived on time every day, always very courteous and really professional.     I highly recommend this company , their attention to detail and customer service truly made this very chaotic process so worth it.  I am so happy with the end product.</Text>< pictures>

Green Valley painting is phenomenal. Can't say enough about this company. We did an interior house remodel, and Ian and his team stood above the rest. They are professional, helpful, and reliable, with top notch customer service, communication and friendly care from the very beginning to the very end of the project. They have great attention to detail and respect for your home. Green Valley Painting will be our go to for any future painting needs. Do not hesitate to use them, we highly recommend them,
total 5 stars in our book! VERY IMPRESSIVE!</Review>

<gmapID>0x80851452ef828c77:0x23e53b8ad2a692eb< /gmapID><review>Green Valley Painting went beyond my expectations in customer service and quality of work.  Ian and his team did a fantastic job and I'd recommend them to anyone.  If you are reading this and unsure if you should work with Green Valley Painting, I'd tell you YES....in a heartbeat.  We recently completed a total house refresh and they painted our cabinets, walls, banister, railings, fire place and dry wall repair.  Green Valley Painting was easiest to work with out of all our contractors.< /review><user>100784414395794172771< /user><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOheR3i5FbIpkHbDPCd8BbdsE-duQEWOujZmp7G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTNJqh_7UTtgfqfFnuRgvAH0is033IEtu_p1nU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhCy3kYgwRUBVoaHJsKrcVAgE_h_G_eVadcV4O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOc7m8MEydFGREk3iIvl8kJmhEMRIaavpcVmA9I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgx6XRGJ7-Jx93XDUF-RPs_vvh1ZcFaEKGx2bK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQHIbGQvbNyx9n0lIupO-3h3dx-0FXIrhycxOn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBtM7Cf4cXXzrE14DGsDbef0b02zSeRtJFf1PE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNInX-jFGhJ5hh5JcdnkYyKOk9paAhZArMFrLOe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZeSjSOig5Oyizj01NaUPdxY83HhsVINI-b_3l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOM_3woQt5-Uf1M_OAhCamfKcAj4fZQKoYe4aAY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjmwO9NTFGAu-aRphrOAzY0GM8OvjC0XBvhvjf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBCcj38ufb9n6avHnIm7v-vkAqpt6xBn9kaDM6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgg8dt8wZD8xv-Y8etCUF1AvHPVq2e1NKwex4D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDTs4PlnGRCPDDktmiblHx-35rAzbHfm4TDq2Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFMapvprxc2BTJorjxmy-Srw4TR9MZUQ7jdneB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUcozh3OV-paiff-69XLWiBPyPy_ZJ89n4IRCM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNylLGJBOLL_JKMr3gClCr1cRsuRi-0TbBftOXP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIyymf0t91qT90rNFSuhnxamHlBLWMTsCY-C6n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMf97v7e9FQRNYxw6P132zoScuCNomyL8TdTrO9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHi8i3wkmAkIvdRiIKzDxmuGHXrkj5cJ_auz8j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWSDNf3TC1BRcbKmMvz3UdGK-PZOWvkkkvDjL8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Name>

We HIGHLY recommend using Ian and his company!   The quality of their work was outstanding but they went above and beyond quality by helping us with decisions.  Their patience and guidance were incredible!!!  Their knowledge and expertise, timeliness, and respect for our questions allow us the opportunity to rave about them all.  The overall Supervisor, Brandon, couldn't be any better and Ricardo's painting team worked as one to make our house a home!:)  We know that anyone using Green Valley Painting will be as happy as we are with the end results...they are the BEST!!!< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>It's not very often that I give a review but I feel this company has earned one. I obtained several estimates to paint my house and chose Green Valley Painting. The attention to detail impressed me. My house is not an easy one to paint and it took some expertise. The crew of painters were professional, energetic, and on a mission. You could tell this is a result of an organized and well run company. I would like to thank Ian and all of Green Valley Painting for a job well done.
Not all homes are alike and so not all prices are alike. As a licensed contractor and real estate agent I call it as I see it. Some of the companies that I contacted did not have workman's comp or liability insurance. This is so important especially when the painters need to climb on your roof to paint your chimneys and other hard to access areas. Green Valley Painting includes their insurance certificates with their proposal. I have painted myself and have hired many painting contractors over the years but it's obvious that Green Valley Painting stands out. Once again-Thank You.

<rating>5</rating><Review>Our experience with Green Valley Painting was great. Everyone was very punctual on all appointments and workdays. The job was completed in the time frame given. Exterior paint / primer appears to be very good quality when compared to surrounding homes. Color consulting was useful. Received additional advise on color accenting which paid off, the outcome was fantastic. Trim lines are pretty much perfect. Would definitely recommend Green Valley Painting to anyone looking for a professional painting company.</Review>< Pics>

We have two 2-story buildings at our residence.  We had GV paint the interior & exterior several years ago & it still looks fabulous.  Ian, the owner, had great recommendations for paint color and type.  His crew washed it, caulked it, primed & otherwise prepped it before, which is why it still looks great.  Recently we had them paint the interior of our carriage house.  Same story - excellent service, excellent prep, beautiful paint job, and cleaned up after.  BTW, their texture repair guy does a fabulous job.  We expect to have  them come to repair our earthquake cracks, too.  You can count on Green Valley to do an outstanding job.</review>

<text>In april we started a first floor remodel, and kitchen cabinets were the last step in our project. Replacing and refacing were out of the budget, so we opted for painting. I was nervous that painting wouldn't look as beautiful or professional as "new" but I could not have been more wrong!

Enter Green Valley Painting. From the front desk staff to the paint crew, they were courteous, clean, efficient and the finished product was more than we could have hoped for. They arrived on time daily and left our home clean when they departed. The owner Ian, was patient with me while I picked color and the hardware, which they installed for us. With a young son at home we were grateful for their adherence to the project schedule and the job was completed on time as promised.

If you have a painting project that you want done quickly with excellent results, I promise you will not be disappointed by Ian and the team at Green Valley Painting!</text>< GmapID>

<review>Overall quality job. We are very detail oriented people and pay attention to the small things and they were able to meet our requests and standards. The only issue was that they washed the staining brushes in the grass and we found a few dried globs of paint in the rocks. Other than that they were clean and professional. We are very happy with their work and would strongly recommend to others.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80851452ef828c77:0x23e53b8ad2a692eb< /Gmap_id>< rating>

<review>We had Green Valley paint the exterior of our store , Pacific Ace Hardware, and they were fantastic. Very professional through the whole process. Our store was open for the few days they were painting and we had customers going in and out. The paint crew was great with them and stayed clear but also had great interaction and even helped out a few. The paint job in the end was beautiful. We are very pleased with the job they did and highly recommend them for any paint job you have.< /review><Rating>5</Rating>< pictures>

My experience with Green Valley was exceptional, truly.  I don't write a lot of reviews and have no stake in this other to thank Ian and his crew' for their work. I'm a real estate professional and investor and have ordered countless painting jobs over the years. I even worked my way through college painting and ran many of my own jobs in my early career and the point I am trying to make is, I know good from bad and exceptional from very good.  These guys are very talented, professional, courteous and actually fun to be around. Naturally I got several bids and theirs was very fair.  I have learned that fa air bid usual trumps a low and a high bid rarely equated to better quality - more generally to a company that may be understaffed and can throw a number at the job and hope for the best.  So thank you Ina and Green Valley and I hope you are willing to work with me again.< /Text>

<rating>5</rating><review>Green Valley Painting did an amazing job on the exterior of our home.  From the assistance with picking our paint scheme to the final touches Green Valley Paint treated us with professionalism, care and kindness. WE LOVE OUR EXTERIOR PAINT!

The beautiful paint job has made our home the envy of all in our neighborhood.  We can not praise Ian, Casey and the the Green Valley team enough. If you want paint you should look at no one else. I know they will be doing my interior next!< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOegQLaYBu6S5FNwaynW-NY19VEx9hc0zET6jQr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnnKukuawt3dRd8mrkbQgcPJ5KDP6GGbCplWjM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiPLwI29MLJzwgkGCd-Et-_U1xng4ZlyTm5DZg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNH-UiFzSSioko1-EPg14vbQIyMHP6Y4JJhr1nk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYVCvr4NuqN34r-9EdXuXELOYKVaJPAOf7rfvl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzn4UiX9qHStDn5OhZkDdDsRRwVGvsr6zNPyMi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2XHm2vW4-eOkIorj0nt1D15kV8aeZ2zA5p6Gs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1UjozROgkgGJJhNYFQ5I_nXev3QF94YKs02iD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLdE9Y4mE8FN29QiXk_4_knW4FJUzB0-GtJyJc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjP5de3tC9m1tJXx7eB-vHcMQMUSm8h8KyzJA2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfXP7JPURWSsdN-6ZG8kp23ldNsIwuhL4fZQ9Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4YnumUpNOD-0VNmRt21vtgycfUNxJ-iXeRLOw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1552485869925, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Working with Green Valley was one of the best decisions we could have ever made! They essentially gave us a brand new house. Their level of detail can not be matched. The crew was incredibly efficient and just the friendliest group of guys. The compliments from neighbors has been constant, even people driving have come to a stop to let us know how much they love the new paint exterior! We’re excited to work with Green Valley again on the interior of our home. Thank you again Green Valley!!<//Text>< pictures>

We chose Green Valley Painting based off reviews only, and it was one of the best decision we've made for our new home. They are phenomenal to work with. Three major things stood out to me while working with them:

1. I specifically wanted Benjamin Moore White Dove for my walls, but when I tested out Kelly Moore's match of White Dove (this is the paint company they prefer to use), I felt like the color was not the same. When I asked Casey, the project manager, about it, he assured me that he would make sure that Kelly Moore matched the paint correctly to the Benjamin Moore sample I wanted, and he did. That may not seem like a big deal, but when you are paying thousands of dollars to paint the entire interior of your house, and you want a specific color, it matters that it's done correctly and Casey made sure that it was. He also was extremely helpful in guiding decisions regarding trim/ceiling color since he used to work for Kelly Moore and has a lot of expertise.

2. We had a miscommunication on the length of time the project would take, and had movers scheduled to come while the work was still being done. Casey and the rest of the crew went above and beyond to work with us to make sure that our household goods could be delivered on time, even going as far as to put extra guys on the job to get it done so that we didn't have to reschedule our move.

3. Their work is phenomenal. They painted all interior walls, ceilings and trim for us (including doors), but the thing that stood out the most to us was how they fixed the trim that the previous homeowners had installed. Before, it had cracks and looked DIY. After Green Valley, it looks brand new and 100% professionally installed with all the previous flaws gone.

I don't know how they're pricing compares since they were the only quote we were able to do, but I believe they are well worth the cost of their services. Every interaction with this team from the owner, Ian, down to the members of the crew was professional and positive. We cannot recommend them enough!< /text>

<user_name>Chad Tobin< /user_name><text>I guess the best way to describe Green Valley Painting is....WOW. I have used other painters over the years, however, Green Valley Painting's attention to detail is what really stands out. You can really tell that they care. I asked a few of the painters how do they like working for Ian (owner) and they all basically said he was either a great boss or the BEST they have ever worked for. What a nice compliment.

I am very happy with how everything turned out. I had them paint my exterior shutters so that the front of my house and they did the entire interior. There is an old saying: 'You get what you pay for' and that is exactly how I feel. I have used Green Valley Painting on several projects now and they are my go to Painter.

They prefer to use Kelly Moore paint and now I see why. This company does not cut any corners. On one of my jobs they did for me in Napa a 2400 sq ft home they used over a 100 gallons of paint. One of the neighbors said that the painter they had used less than 70. The exterior was completely sealed and it looked FANTASTIC with the Elastomeric Paint.

Ian is a great guy that has a wonderful supporting cast. I hear is a great golfer too. I highly recommend using Green Valley Painting for all your painting needs. Once you hire them you will see what I am talking about. Once you find the BEST there is no point in trying the REST.

Thank you Green Valley Painting!</text></record>

Green Valley Painting is a top notch business that you can expect to provide a high quality, if not premium, paint job on your home. I spoke to the crew several times and they were friendly and went above and beyond to ensure I was satisfied with the work. It was also clear they really enjoyed working with Ian (owner of Green Valley Painting) and that Ian treats them well, pays them fairly, and focuses on overall employee well being. We got several bids for the work to paint the exterior of our home, and Green Valley Painting was at the higher end. However, it was clear that they approach their work differently, and ensure that the home is fully protected and pays attention to the details that others neglect. I highly recommend this business to anyone looking for professional, high quality painting work.<//Review>

Wow! The painters at Green Valley Painting really know what they are doing. Impeccable masking and protection of other finishes, and a pride in their craft you don’t often see. Very knowledgeable in the features of all types of paints. The entire crew was punctual every day, and polite and accommodating to us. We had them paint two completely renovated units in our 4-plex a year ago, then made sure to have them back this year to do the other two units and some exterior work. Just a very pleasant experience all around - and the place looks great!<//review>

Green Valley Painting came up HUGE for us on multiple occasions!
They painted our new home before we moved in.  We appreciated the help color consulting, and the detail of workmanship.  Lines were super clean.  Texture match repaires were flawless.   They fit us in a tight timeline.  I think dropcloths were coming up as we were moving in!

We were so happy, we asked them to come back out to paint the exterior several months later.  They repaired rotted trim boards, and sealed up the house just in time for the fires... No smoke inside this house!  They did another great job... no clean up afterwards.  We love it.
You can't go wrong with Green Valley Painting.< /review>

<date>1594328590619< /date><rating>5<//rating><Text>Impressed is an understatement about our experience with Green Valley Painting. Our home is over a hundred years old and desperately needed to be refreshed. Paint was a big decision, considering the history and location of house, so deciding on a company did not come easy.  We received several bids and chose Green Valley Painting because of the obvious commitment to quality. That passion for high-end craftsmanship showed up every day with every team member.  Everyone was punctual, considerate, friendly and detail oriented. Any imperfection caused by an old home was addressed throughout the entire process. Even our neighbors noticed the commendable efforts.   Now that the job is complete we receive daily compliments by passerby's. The work of Green Valley Painting not only transformed our home, it improved a neighborhood.</Text>< Pictures>

My experience with Green Vly Painting was top notch.  They were professional, punctual, courteous and helpful.  Honestly, I thought they were more concerned about doing a proper job than I was.  Most importantly, they did a truly excellent job of repainting the inside of my house.  It turned out better than I expected.   Kudos to them.  They treated me like I try to treat customers of my small business.  I can give no higher praise than that.< /review>

They have painted the full exteriors and interiors of two of our homes (so far), and have also done special jobs like painting kitchen cabinets (an amazing transformation), staining decks and fencing, touching up/repainting after drywall repairs, and removing 50-year-old wallpaper (that was a doozy). They even updated my daughter's vintage bedroom set with the perfect color of sage green. They have a talented team and always recommend excellent craftsmen for other home-improvement tasks, such as drywall and flooring. We never miss a chance to recommend them to friends, family, and even strangers on the internet.</Text>< pics>

It's hard to even articulate a review that can capture how amazing this crew truly is. Prompt, polite, professional, hardworking, detailed oriented, and thorough. To be honest, there is no reason to look any further for your painting needs. This company offers it all! And in addition to the exemplary service, they are competitively priced! So I truly feel you get even more than you pay for by going with Green Valley Painting. They started by painting the interior of our home..the entire house..every room including the closets and pantry.  They work so closely with Kelly Moore that they were able to coordinate getting samples of various colors up for us so we could confidently pick the right colors. And they completed the interior so promptly and still to perfection. It was their great work on the interior that then moved us to use them on our exterior. Same great experience, with added digital renderings to provide to our HOA, and truly top-notch work throughout the entirety of the project. They start with pressure washing, then priming, then painting, then touch up, then a second detailed check, then a thorough cleaning upon completion (even window washing!). This group is the best. They most definitely transformed a home we love into a home that just puts us in awe. So many compliments from neighbors only validates that it's not just us that are awestruck. We cannot thank them enough! Green Valley Painting, you guys are definitely the BEST! Like I said before, don't waste your time using anyone else.</Text>

Green Valley Painting accomplished an amazing job on painting the exterior of my house here in Napa.  I got a very reasonable estimate and would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs their house painted. The preparation was very thorough, which was followed by the house being completely coated in primer, then two finish coats.  The Painters are super professional and great to work with.  They have a particular masking technique that makes all the trim have super sharp lines when it is complete.  They left everything clean and tidy when they were finished.  Highly recommended company.</text>

It was my first time having to go through this process.  I received bids from multiple companies throughout my area.  I did a lot of research on the type of paint as well as research on the requirements of a company.  It was easy for me to exclude the bids that were at a lower price, as these companies were not licensed and bonded, and the savings was not worth it to me to risk going with cheaper companies.  When I narrowed it down to two different companies, there was a difference of $1000.00 between them as well as a difference in the paint material.  When I questioned Green Valley Painting about the paint material (which was Elastomeric Paint) and the experience of the painters using the material, the owner of the company Ian Lillibridge personally came out to my home to address the questions that I had, and had assured me that for these types of painting projects, they only use Elastomeric paint and would not suggest any other type of paint for their customers.   When I questioned the competing company (who was using the best Acrylic paint), they stated (over the phone) that my home was not in bad enough shape to require Elastomeric Paint, but if I insisted on the product, they would provide me an estimate for the product.  Their estimate came at a few hundred dollars less than Green Valley Painting. What were my deciding factors on selecting Green Valley Painting over the other?  For one:  this is an investment into my home.  I made it clear to Ian, when he offered to look at my bid and see if he could reduce it, that for me it wasn't about getting the cheaper deal, it was about getting a worth while investment. I was under the impression that Ian too saw this as a worthwhile investment for all of his customers, and therefor only uses Elastomeric Paint for these types of jobs.  This lead me to also believe that his painting crew had the experience necessary to properly apply the Elastomeric Paint (which through my research, I had found that if applied incorrectly, issues would occur and the product would not work as it was intended for).  I did not feel the same confidence in the other company.  For two:  Elastomeric paint is rated to last longer than the best Acrylic paint (when applied properly), this was a worthwhile investment and as stated previously, I was lead to believe that Green Valley Painting has the knowledge and experience to properly apply the Elastomeric paint.  For Three:  the company really took care of me, answering the million questions that I had, walking me through each step of the process multiple times and working with me on the timing of when my home would be painted (this was all being handled during the covid pandemic crisis)  For Four:  I was explaining the adventure of finding a painting company and selecting Green Valley Painting to a friend of mine, who in turn, also had his house painted by Green Valley Painting BEFORE me and he was absolutely impressed with the work that this company had done.  This in turn assured me that I did select the right company and I felt confident in going through with the having them paint my home.  Was everything 100% perfect, absolutely not, there was some minor issues that in my opinion were bound to happen, but were handled relatively quickly.  I would absolutely, without a doubt, use this company again.  I do have an interior painting job that if I decide not to go through the hassle of painting it myself, I would call on this company to do it for me.

It was a big job and I was surprised how quickly they finished. I would highly recommend them and intend to use them for all my painting needs in the future.< /Text>< pics>

We were delighted to have Green Valley Painting paint the interior of our house.  They were over a thousand dollars less expensive than the competing bid and very meticulous about their work.  We are very pleased.  Both the sheet rock fellow and the painting team were men we enjoyed having in our home.  The were friendly, courteous and a joy to be around.<//review>

<review>I can’t say enough about how pleased I am with the Green Valley Painting.  This was my second cabinet painting project and the first one was a disaster but I learned more than I need to know about how cabinets should be painted.  Green Valley Painting painted all my cabinets and entertainment center and it came out beautifully.   They knew exactly what they were doing, they made sure they took the time to get it done right and it was a very fair price.  I will not hesitate to rehire them when I need some other work done and I will not hesitate to recommend them, they did and will do excellent work.  Here are some pictures to prove my point.< /review>< Pics>

Green Valley Painting Inc. promises a lot when they take a job and they deliver. They assisted me with paint color selection that pops on my house. It looks and feels like a new home. They pay attention to detail, work well in their team, use a high quality paint, and keep the property as clean as possible while completing the job. The entire process was seamless. I highly recommend Ian Lillibridge and Green Valley Painting Inc.</review>

<Text>Green Valley Painting Inc.  did a fantastic job! They were well organized and every end of day they would leave things clean and in order. They were quick in responding when we had questions on how to proceed during the process. They also were quick to respond and correct any issues we saw needed attention.  They have all the connections to quickly address any issues of rot wood, etc. I would hire them again if I need any painting done in my house. Very respectful, good listeners and quick to follow through.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><date>1571248953330</date><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Post Atlas Peak fire, we had a bad experience with a local painter. Upon a friend's recommendation we called Ian the owner of Green Valley Painting. His crew came in and professionally did a fabulous job fixing and finishing the interior paint job. Ian had given us a quote almost two years ago for painting the exterior trim and garage doors. Due to construction/contractor delays we weren't able to have him to do the work until recently. Not only did he do the work at the 2016 quote, the work was done timely and professionally. Ian is a pleasure to work with and his crew very pleasant. I recommend GV Painting for both interior and exterior painting.< /Review>< pics>

Ian and his crew did an amazing job on my house. They went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. Ian and Casey came back to the job site several times to make sure everything was not only up to their standards, but to ours as well. The crew always showed up on time, cleaned their work areas when finished for the day, provided us with updates, and completed a walk through with us upon completion of the job. I have referred several people to Green Valley Painting and am always provided with positive feedback. Being in Real Estate, it is important that the people I refer to Clients are professionals. I never hesitate to refer Green Valley Painting to my Clients - and that speaks volumes.<//Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Getting your house painted inside can be very invasive, especially  if you aren’t vacating the premises- but Green valley painting really did a great job working with us and sharing the space.  They gave great attention  to detail and we were extremely pleased with how clean the finished work was . A couple of the doors were sticking at bit , and needed minor adjustment , (after the work was completed , ) and one of the caulking lines in master bath needed to be redone,  but they came right back out and finished the work to our complete satisfaction. Ian and Casey were very responsive via email and phone during the entire process -answering all of our questions in a timely manner. In fact , both even came out to the house personally to check in and see the progress. You can tell that they have pride in the work done and integrity of the business. Highly recommend this company.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Ian and his team did a full house painting, and three deck reseal, including color consulting, on a pretty complicated and good size home.  Incredibly professional, clean, friendly, and the attention to detail was so high that three of us did a pre-final walk around, found four things, and before we even had a chance to mention them, three of them -they- found, leaving only a trivial small issue to be resolved.  Start to finish, including powerwashing (and then even did the stone patio and surrounding pool deck just because they were there), all in 6 days.  -Outstanding- and I'm a very tough grader.< /Review>< name>

I don't ever write reviews but I felt compelled to write one for this company. We had our home and guest house painted and it was going to be a pretty big job. This company came in with the most reasonable bid and let me tell you, THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL was amazing. Ian, Casey and the entire crew were courteous and went above and beyond just the painting. They left the yard spotless after the job was completed and again, the attention to detail was flawless.
We are looking forward to having Green Valley Painting come out and repaint our cabinets as well as treating our garage floor with epoxy this winter. I absolutely would not hesitate in recommending Green Valley Painting to anyone who needs some painting done.<//text>

They provided us with a thorough estimate that covered all of the details and cost. They were able to start the job the following week and the crew was on time and very accommodating to our requests as the job went on. They even worked through the 2-day power outage we had without issue. Our house was no easy task to paint, and they got the job done in a week and on budget as quoted. I would highly recommend them to anybody looking for a trustworthy and professional crew in the Bay Area.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Green Valley Painting is the best!  I have worked with Ian and his crew twice and would not hesitate to call them again.  They have painted cabinets, baseboards, crown molding, repaired sheetrock and textured an entire bathroom in my home.

We have had a lot remodeling and work done to our house and this is the first time I have ever written a review and recommendation. I highly recommend Green Valley Painting! In October 2019 we had Green Valley Painting come in and paint the complete inside of our house. Including bathrooms, cupboards, cabinets, closets, doors, base boards and molding. Their prep work, painting and workers were extremely professional. The owner, Ian Lillibridge, was great at communicating to us when he could start the job and when it would be finished. Ian even had his workers come in on a Saturday to finish the job. I have high standards so if I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Green Valley Painting you know that they are reliable, organized, do a fantastic painting job and they clean up after themselves!!< /review>

Green Valley Painting just completed an exterior painting of our house and we couldn’t be more satisfied. Ian and his crew members did outstanding work and were very detail oriented. From start to finish Ian and project manager Casey were excellent about communicating with us on the work schedule and the process in general. The crew was respectful of our property and the area was thoroughly cleaned up at the end of the project. I would have no reservations in recommending them to anyone looking for a painting company.</Review>

Green Valley Painting is the real deal.  They painted our kitchen cabinetry a couple of years ago and most recently they painted the entire exterior of our house and all of our retaining walls.  They are truly perfectionists. Everything looks amazing.  The crew is large and quick and leave everything even better then they found it!  They earned every star and more!!  Don't go anywhere else - seriously!!<//Review>

This is a new review because I needed them again due to more water damage  😢😢😢. Casey, Clemente and the whole team, including Cindy and office staff, are awesome! Great communication, fair pricing and excellent workmanship. I’m  so thrilled with this company if I could give ten stars I would! I had water damage in my condo due to a leak in the upstairs unit x2. The men are so good at what they do and I was able to trust my home and animals with the staff at Green Valley. Thank you to the whole team!!!
Important to note again that the first time it happened their estimate came in $2000 less than some crooked contractor trying to swindle me. This place is honest and upfront about costs and work needing to be done.
Happy Holidays all and remember Green Valley is one to trust.<//Text>

Green Valley Painting recently painted the interior of our home. In addition to painting the walls, ceilings and trim we had them paint our kitchen and bathroom cabinets. Everything turned out great.
From estimating through final payment Ian and his crew were top notch to deal with. They arrived on time every morning  and left the worksite cleaned and organized every afternoon.  We are very pleased with the results.<//review>

< Review>
I don't review on any site much, but for a big job like this, it was worth my time to give them props! If you've painted a house before (interior or exterior), you may be privy to all the minor details. I've painted the interior walls of all the places I've lived in...and I must say, I'm pretty anal when it comes to the little details. A friend of mine, who's very thorough when it comes to finding quality products and service, used Green Valley for their home (exterior). I would come over every now and again and see the attention to detail and speed in which the painters worked. So why recreate the wheel when my friend did all her homework? So we hired them too. As most reviewers said, they are not the cheapest (nor the most expensive); but the fairest. My home is finished, and is, honestly, in better shape than how the builders left it (we bought this home brand new). Green Valley Painting caulked around every window and flashing...I don't think I'll ever have to worry about water seeping through and causing dry rot!! We work hard for the meager monies we have, so it is important that we spend it wisely. In this case, money was well spent now for a beautiful home and a worry-free future!<//Review>

<Review>The overall experience with GVP was amazing start to finish. My family of 6 lived in the house while the work was in progress. Each day during the work I would come home to lots of progress and they tried hard to keep our house as functional as possible during the painting progress. They were professional and detailed. The quality of work was superb! The project manager checked in daily to see how the job was going and kept me updated on the timeline. The job was done early than expected with out finding any touch ups on the final walk through. Couldn’t be happier with the results and recommend them to everyone I know!<//Review>< username>

Green Valley Painting is an excellent company to work with.  Casey Bollmann was our Project Manager and he was right on top of and issues or concerns we had.  They did any excellent job on the job on the dry rot repairs.  The crew that worked on the house were excellent workers.  On time everyday and responded to all our requests.  Price was very fair and they used excellent products.  Would use them again for any painting, inside or outside.  Ian Lillibridge is the owner and a great person to work with.  Our home looks better than when we moved in and the home was brand new.  Could not be happier about how our home looks now.< /text>

I’ve used Green Valley Painting for a few jobs at my house, I had them paint the interior of my house and my kitchen cabinets.
Ian provided me with a bid and we scheduled the work to start shortly after that. I couldn’t be happier with the finished project. The crew is amazing, they pay attention to detail and are very pleasant to work with. I will continue to use them for future projects and I would highly recommend them to anyone that needs painting done.<//review>

Ian and his team were awesome!  They painted our house in Green Valley in just over 1 week.  The team he sent were on time, polite and most of all, PROFESSIONAL!  Aside from the great paint job, Ian worked with us to pick out are base color, trim and accent colors.  Most importantly,  he responded to all e mails, texts and phone calls promptly!  Right after our house was painted, a neighbor sent us a note complimenting us on our color choices!  Thanks Ian for making our house beautiful!< /text>

Great work from start to finish.  They are true professionals and detail oriented.  They do an excellent job of covering the windows and concrete.  Ian was very responsive to all of our needs and completely understanding when we experienced some indecisiveness and switched the color a couple times (before he bought it).  All in all a great experience and glad we chose them.
Also, it's great to have a company stand behind their work and do whatever it takes to satisfy the customer. They include a 5 year warranty with the job and are responsive to ongoing needs.< /text>

Ian and crew recently completed the second complete interior paint job (2 different places) with great results.  They have established themselves as my go to paint company.   Now, they are not the cheapest, but they are fair and the quality of work is great, and the crew is great as well.  You can always find a cheaper paint job...but in my experience there is a lot of truth in..."you get what you pay for".  Great work, great guys.</Text>

Big kudos to Green Valley Painting. Ian, Casey and crew were reliable, friendly, punctual, and above all courteous and professional. From the initial contact when Ian was the first respondent to our request, to sending his license along with the quote, and ultimately scheduling us within a week, the project exceeded our expectations. Even when part of the color scheme didn't quite match what we had envisioned (due to no fault of theirs), Ian offered to come back out and repaint 2 rooms at no extra charge to us.
We are very happy with the results and will now be proud to entertain guests in our home. We have already recommended GVP to one of our neighbors. Thanks for a job well done!< /Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1550531157913, 'text': 'Thank you it was a pleasure working for you.'}<//Resp><Pics>None</Pics><text>Ian and his crew far exceeded my expectations!! Purchasing a home that needed a lot of work was pretty scary, and after meeting with a few bids, I knew I was doomed and in the back of my mind I was prepared to paint an over 2000sqft home from top to bottom myself.  My last appointment was with Green Valley Painting.  Ian was very prompt, courteous and detailed.  He asked me what work I wanted to get done outside of painting and to my surprise he did some of it! Removing part of a wall, removing old baseboards and installing new ones. He checked in with me constantly with what work was done that day and would tell me what work was going to be done next. He would go over the little details as far as where I wanted the kitchen hardware placed, and whether I wanted his crew to replace the hold hinges and doorknobs so they would all match.  As exciting as it is to purchase a home, I would stop by often and check out the work done and Ian’s crew were very kind and professional.  They would do a walk through with me on what was done and always left the job site clean and neat at the end of the day.

Ian and his crew really put my worry at ease.  I’m so happy with the work they did and am planning on getting the outside of the house painted by them! Even after the work was complete , Ian would check in and see if I had any questions.  Really great decision going with Green Valley Painting.< /text>< Time>

We hired so we thought "professional painters" to paint the interior of our home... well it turned out to be a nightmare! Long story short, I sent Ian an email on Sunday explaining the mess we where in and he responded that day. He was at our house on Tuesday to take a look... started Thursday and by Saturday they were all done.
Ian and his crew did a amazing job painting our home. They are very professional, detail oriented, and clean. Ian is excellent with communication between the homeowner and Green Valley Painting.
I will never call anyone else to do our painting. Ian, you have a customer for life!
Thank you again for saving us...so glad we found your company!

<Resp>{'time': 1557168455510, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to write a review.  We look forward to returning for the next phase!'}<//Resp><Text>This is my first review but I had to share the great experience I had with Green Valley Painting.

After years of deferred maintenance on my house 2018 was the year when things finally got done.  The biggest piece was gutting and completely remodeling two bathrooms and a laundry room.  Of course once the construction work was done it all needed to be painted.

The first guy (from another company) to give me an estimate spent the whole time at my house telling me what he couldn't do and then sent me a high number for work we hadn't discussed.  The second company spent 5 minutes looking at the job, didn't ask any questions and then gave me a ridiculously low number right there on the spot.

Then Ian from Green Valley Painting came in.  He took his time, asked all of what seemed like the right questions, answered all of my questions clearly and sent me a quote with all of the work listed out correctly.  He was actually the highest of the three quotes but it didn't take me long to make up my mind and we scheduled the work.

It was completed in early January and I couldn't be happier. The crew was on time each day and I was very impressed with the care they put into the prep work.  They even removed the new light fixtures from the bathrooms instead of just taping around them like I had thought they would do.  One of the bathrooms is very small and it couldn't have been easy to tape off all the edges, counter top and trim but they did and I haven't seen even a speck of paint out of place.

I took advantage of the fact that they were going to remove all the existing cabinet hardware to buy new cabinet hinges and handles.  The screws that came with the handles I bought ended up being too long so the handles were all loose.  Ian had his guys come back for an unscheduled fourth day to touch up one area I was concerned about and he sent them with washers to fix all the cabinet handles while they were there.  I didn't expect that.

So I'm very happy with Green Valley Painting, Ian and his crew and will be having them back in a couple of months for the next phase of work on my house.< /Text>< GmapID>

<Review>I very recently had the entire interior of my home painted by Green Valley Painting. I have a hard time choosing colors even though I had painted swatches of each color on the walls. I was anxious about how the house would look afterwards. When I returned home after the painting was finished, I was stunned and amazed. I’ve never seen such a flawless paint job before. The colors are gorgeous. Painting my house was complicated by many transitions from one wall to another and very high ceilings in the main room. Every seam between a wall and the ceiling is crisp and perfectly straight. All of the trim was painted flawlessly.

This was as good as it gets! I can’t thank the guys who actually did the work enough. They were Abraham, Tony and Efrain. They aren’t just highly skilled painters; they’re artists. The project manager for my job was Casey Bollmann. Casey handled my job flawlessly from the time of my first contact with Green Valley. He set my expectations, communicated with me every step of the way, and delivered on the expectations he set.

I heartedly recommend Green Valley! If you want a paint job that will leave you loving being in your home as long as you own it, call them!</Review>< Pics>

I have hired Green Valley Painting for 2 jobs and have been more than pleased with both of them. Ian and his crew are fast, efficient, and professional. They always show up when they say they are going to and work a full day. I have high ceilings with wall paper on the walls in my house. They have the wall paper off, the walls textured, and the painting completed within 5 days. It is amazing to watch!  I highly recommend Green Valley Painting.< /Text>

WOW!  Amazing results! Met with Ian about painting the interior of our new home. We had time constraints and were still choosing colours, but Ian and the Green Valley Painting staff made it all so easy!  The office  emailed the estimate within 24 hours, along with his license, and in less than a week our home was ready for moving in. Price quoted was more than fair. Schedules don't always mesh as well as ours did, but the painting was absolutely perfect!  No touch-ups, everything clean, and a beautiful paint job!  Ian met us at the house for a final walk-thru and made sure we were happy with the results.  We were DELIGHTED!!!< /Review>

<Text>Green Valley Painting is our go to business for all our painting needs.  I have made the mistake of using others in haste and regretted it!  They are professional, efficient, knowledgeable and fair.  The attention to detail and the ability to leave our business exactly the way they found it is amazing.  I never find anything broken or out of place, and I definitely never find mistakes in their painting.  I have personally worked with Green Valley Painting in my home with the same experience so it was only natural to hire them in my business.  I highly recommend!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This is the fourth time that our family has contracted with Green Valley Painting and as always- we are 100% pleased with the work they've done! Due to the size of our house and the fact that we didn't want to move out while they painted the interior, Ian's crew split the job into two phases. They were so easy to work with and very patient with my daily inspections. We needed some serious drywall repairs and the work done was perfect- you can't even tell. I love the help they give with paint colors and sheens. In addition, Ian's quote was fantastic and he was willing and able to start the work a couple of months earlier than the other bids we looked at. We will continue to highly recommend Green Valley Painting.<//text>

<Text>Green Valley Painting = Thumbs Up.  I've had Ian help me out twice and both times were success stories.  Pricing is great, some work was done complimentary, flexible schedule, squeezed out an additional staff member just to crunch out the job so that I didn't have to take an additional day off.  All in all I'm a happy customer.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

We had left messages with three other paint companies and never heard back from any of them.  We made a fourth and most likely last attempt to a painting company when I called Green Valley Painting.

Ian called back and scheduled a time to come over to obtain a quote.  I received a quote and copies of GVP insurance documents by email a few days later. Two weeks later the crew was here to start our job.

We all know construction workers tend to run by a time clock of their own.  That certainly wasn't the case with Green Valley Painting.  The painters arrived when they said they would both days.😃

The painters were very friendly and did an awesome job.

Great company to work with.  I would highly recommend their services.<//review>

<Review>I have used Green Valley Painting several times over the past few years and have always found them to be excellent.  GVP has painted my homes and offices and they have always been on time, provided great quality, trustworthy and respectful of our time.  Ian and his crew always seem to be willing to go the extra mile...  I would not hesitate to recommend GVP to anyone looking to paint a home or business!  Great job guys!  Corey<//Review>< Pics>

I have hired the team from Green Valley Painting for well over 10 plus jobs.  They have always done excellent work along with excellent service. Quality work at a fair price. I highly recommend their services.<//Text>

<Text>Green Valley Painting did an amazing job for us! Our living and dining rooms have 18 foot ceilings so not an easy job. Ian brought in a great crew and they completed it when they said they would! Casey was also great, checking up on things every step of the way. They even coordinated with the company re-doing our hardwood floors and followed up and made sure that the new baseboards looked perfect! If you're looking for painting pros these are the guys!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

If you are looking for a high quality, detail oriented painting company look no further. From start to finish, Green Valley made sure everything was perfect. I recently completed an entire interior painting project. Everything from walls, ceiling, crown, baseboards, and all cabinetry. I used another painting company to paint the interior of my home in 2014 and it was a disaster. I won’t mention any names specifically, but it was the same Napa based company that has 100% glowing reviews on Yelp (which they filter, and pay Yelp to remove by the way). Long story short the company used in 2014 watered down the paint, didn’t use primer on cabinetry, didn’t caulk any windows, left visible paint streaks all over the ceiling, and I never saw the project manager, or owner during the project. My experience with Green Valley was completely opposite of my last experience. From start to finish, Ian the owner was very involved, and made regular visits to the home to ensure everything went smooth. In addition to being a highly organized, efficient, and quality painting contractor, one of the things that impressed me most was the quality of paint they used. Green Valley only uses top grade paint from Kelly Moore, which makes a huge impact on the job, and overall esthetics. Ian the owner, and his head foreman Abraham genuinely cared about my project… They weren’t interested in going as fast as possible, then moving onto the next job. They took their time, and paid attention to details (my cabinetry looks brand new). These guys really care, and are interested in making sure the homeowner gets the highest quality paint job. If you are looking a company that values quality, and offers competitive pricing, given Ian a call.<//text>

I conducted a lot of research on painting contractors before selecting Green Valley Painting. I am glad I did. They are terrific.

GVP painted both the exterior and interior of my nearly 90-year-old childhood home. The job required a lot of prep, which included skim coating the walls in several rooms to a smooth finish. I have consistently been impressed with the quality of GVP's work.

GVP's owner Ian is pleasantly dry and slightly gruff; he's also communicative, straightforward and transparent. GVP's project manager Casey is extremely personable and great at follow-through. In fact, everybody I have encountered been detail-oriented, collegial, and professional.

From my experience GVP's rates are competitive and reasonable. Their quality and professionalism really does stand out — they're one of the best contractors I've used, for anything, full stop. Plus they seem to treat their employees well, which is important to me.

I don't usually leave online reviews. But I’m pleased to leave this one, which I adapted from a private message to a friend who was seeking a painter recommendation. GVP's impeccable reputation is well-earned. I would hire them again without hesitation.< /text>

Hands down, outstanding. If there were 6 stars, GVP would get them. Ian, Casey and their guys delivered. They just finished our interior, top to bottom - walls, ceilings, trim, doors, all cabinets, closets and the garage.  We are first time home buyers which came with a bit of learning curve -- Ian and Casey were very supportive and helpful as we made our decisions. We couldn't be more ecstatic with the final product. We would highly recommend you give GVP a call. We'll be bringing them back to do our exterior ASAP.< /Review>

<text>A good paint job is all about the prep work. These guys did a great job on both my interior and exterior work. They were professional, helpful, and clearly had the expertise needed to paint some challenging surfaces in my house. They were onsite for several days and always cleaned up when left and always showed up on time. The outcome exceeded expectations and I hired them again to paint a second house. I highly recommend them.< /text>< pics>

We've spent much time with Ian and his crew at Green Valley Painting and if you want your home painted the right way you have to have painting professionals that know what they're doing; Ian and his team are just those professionals! We had two homes completely done inside and out and Green Valley Painting is our paint company for life! Thanks Ian and Team!</text>

What an awesome team!  I highered Ian and his crew to paint my parents home.  My mother (not easy to please person) was overly happy with every employee,  Daniel, Ramero, Izaac and Tony.  They were all patient and respectful of them.  She loves the feel and look of the Elastomeric on her stucco.< /Review>

The company was professional, on time, curtious and accommodating.  In addition,  I felt that they went beyond the scope of their work in making sure that I was satisfied with every detail.  Needless to say,  when one is undertaking a project of this magnitude,  several contractors are required. Green Valley Painting was originally contracted to handle only the interior and exterior painting of our home. However, they stepped up and finished work that was performed in a sloppy fashion or incomplete by other contractors.

Ian and his team are exactly the company for which fastidious people like myself are searching.  They pay attention to detail and perform an excellent job.  We've already had several neighbors inquire as to our painters.< /text>< Response>

I went to replace 2 of my tires. After I get called to pick up my car, I drive home, and I notice that the low pressure tire signal is on. I examine my tires and notice that one of my wheels (the one that was supposed to replaced) is completely deflated, they replaced only ONE tire (as opposed to two), and they did not re-cap 3 of my tire air caps. I returned the next day so they could complete the job I paid them to do initially, wasting my time, with no offer of compensation/discount.

The name Nono is befitting; I would not recommend going back.< /text>< Pics>

Why does car trouble only surface on a weekend?  Glad to know NoNo's is open.  Car was diagnosed and serviced quickly and competently.  I was shown video of the problem and the parts replaced.< /Text>

<username>Neil Cotner<//username><Date>1603344555596</Date><rating>5< /rating><review>Went in to get an oil change/tire rotation/full inspection. I had mentioned to them prior to dropping the car off that the oil level was alarmingly low. Without charging me any extra, Tevin explained to me that they would keep the car an extra day to do a deeper inspection to find if I had an oil leak and where it was. They even used some fancy UV additive in the oil paired with a blacklight, and found 3 areas where I had oil leaking! And on top of that, used a detergent to clean some sludge that had built up as a result of the car running with low/bad oil.

Tevin showed me pictures of what he had found on my car, and made the necessary recommendations on what needed to be replaced, and kept the cost low for me. I felt confident that he was honest with me, and did the best he could to give me a good deal, and help me understand what was going on every step of the way. They even fixed a funny noise one of my wheels had started making. Overall, very knowledgeable and honest staff, what more could you ask for?< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

They did the smog test in much less time than many other localities, plus they were easier to find and had easier access.  Done before I read even a short chapter in my book.  Very good.< /Review>

<Text>Staff that knows what the are Doing.
From when we take one of our cars to Nonos to when the service is complete, it is a friendly and helpful experience.
Greeted by the service manager who will tell you the cost and when the car will be ready, the service is top tier.
The car is ready on time and everything is complete when you pick it up with no surprises.
They always tell you what work you need done and most important they are honest. That's hard to find these days.
Thanks, Nonos.

Nono’s Is a great local service station. The check oil light came on in my car. I got busy and days went by. I drove to Nono’s and Brian was at the counter. He was nice, kind, helpful and had no problem fitting me in for what I thought would end up being a complete service. 5 minutes later her came back and said you just need an oil change, but we’ll check everything to be sure. Less ten 25 minutes and Brian was back again. Your car is ready. I paid and was in my car in less then 30 minutes.

Never underestimate that quality of a local gas station. This is my “Go to” place from now on. Thanks Brian.

Worst customer experience I've ever seen. I went here to get air in my tires... they wouldn't give me free air with the purchase of gas like they're supposed to, and then when I asked the cashier to split a bill so I could get quarters for the machine she kept ignoring me and moving on to customers behind me. The pump doesn't stay on long enough to fill all 4 tires so I was only able to fill up 2 in the end; I didn't want to deal with that cashier any longer.<//Text>

<Review>I have always felt extremely well-taken-care-of by Coco and crew. Admittedly, I don't know a lot about cars. But with two cars now, they have given me solid advice, reasonable prices, - and told me when work could wait vs. when it could not. I really trust these guys!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend Nono's 76. I moved nearby and had no idea where to go when my car needed service, and with that came the fear of unknown mechanics working on my beloved Mazda 3. I called AAA and they gave me a list of recommended mechanics in my area. I picked this one and never looked back. Coco, the guy you usually talk to when you bring you car in, is great. He's always given me a competitive deal, better than dealerships, and he takes time to understand the issue and explain the technical stuff when you ask. This place doesn't spend all their money on a luxurious waiting room with 3 plasma TVs etc, it's cozy and modest so you're just paying less to fix your car instead of more to have a massage chair and martini machine while you're waiting. Honesty, great prices and fast, great service!</review>

Nono's service is always very good.  They listen to the issue and are very responsive in fixing the problem. Also, they encourage taking conservative approaches to fixing things -- we have old cars and they help us keep them working!<//Review>

My experience was great, I live close so I was able to leave my car with CoCo and his team. Great service, friendly to work with, and not pushy about additional work. Because the gas station is open 24/7, I ended up picking my car up at 11pm with no issues.<//review>

​DO NOT GET YOUR SMOG CHECK HERE.  The person, I think his name was Joe, who does the smog will find something wrong and make your check engine light come on by disconnecting a sensor or using his smog computer to wipe out your computer information.  Then he will say to you he will easily fix it for a some amount of money like he is going to do you a favor and then he will tell you to pay him directly.  BEAWARE OF THE SMOG TECHNICIANS. They are crooks< /Text>

<review>While Brian, Coco and Fari are as nice as can be, please think twice about leaving you car here for repairs. After my car being in their possession for a month I am forced to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well as the Bureau of Automotive Repair.
Albeit long, here is my story.

They have had my car for 4 weeks now for a repair to pass smog. Against my knowing, they are having it repaired by another shop.

Brought my 1991 VW Vanagon in to Nono's 76 to have it smogged on Sept 8. Was told it will take 25 minutes. 45 minutes later I noticed that people that have come in after me are leaving. Turns out the machine my car was on was bad. Asked the tech about it and he yelled at me and my wife. After an hour and a half, car is done and failed smog.

Upholstery and interior is filthy with grease. Am given a coupon for a car wash.

I am assured by Fari (the supervisor) that they have an expert mechanic who is great with VW vans and that Fari himself had one and has experience working on them. Left it there that day and requested an oil change since it was there anyway. Called to inquire 2 days later and am told that it is done but something has happened during the process that has made the van run poorly. Am asked to test drive it and see for myself. Drive it home and keep it overnight. Car has very little power and is stalling out. Bring it back the next day and talk to Coco who tells me that they weren't even the ones who did the repairs. Ask who did them and he tells me he'll find out. Also tells me that something shorted out while the new catalytic converter was being welded in. They forgot to do the oil change.

Call a couple days later and find out that the car is over at Kartek Mufflers and they are the ones who are working on it. Call a couple times more and speak to Coco who tells me it's not done yet. He eventually hands me back over to Fari who says that Kartek needs an air flow meter and can't find one. Asks me to check to see if I can find one. He might have a lead on a used one. Give him 2 places that have them. 2 days later he tells me they are out of stock. I call that day and find out that that is not true. Fari says that he told his clerk to order it and that's what he told him.

Stop off at Kartek and get their side of the story. Eddie at Kartek tells me that nothing shorted out while they were welding and he just needs the new air flow meter and the car will be fine. Part comes in and I call to see when the van is ready. Eddie tells me that it's done but not running great (which it was when I dropped it off - Drove to San Diego and back without a problem) I take it home for the weekend and the same problem exists. Car has a bit more power but is now hesitating and surging. Stalls again. Bring it back to Eddie and he tells me that he didn't have time to make the needed adjustments on the new air flow meter and wants to call the company where it was purchased to make sure the adjustments won't void the warranty. It is now 3 weeks later.

Call Eddie on Oct 1 (Mind you I have no agreement with Eddie at Kartek to do any repairs. If it were up to me I would have brought it to my VW specialist). Eddie tells me the mechanic who was working on it has not been at work all week because his dog was sick. I am assured that the mechanic is back and will be working on my van and it will be ready on Friday. Call on Friday and am told that they were very busy and that he will definitely have it done on Saturday. Call 3 times on Saturday and am eventually told that they did not get to it and it will be ready on Monday.

Called Fari and explain the situation to him and tell him I'm filing a complaint since I did not authorize this 3rd party to work on the car and after almost 1 month I do not have it. I am seeking a refund to 1. Pay for my rental car for the last month and 2. to pay for my personal mechanic to fix the problem.<//review>< user>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>To be quite honest, Elephant Rock does not resemble an elephant.  It is a beautiful rock composed of ancient, 150 million year old pillow lava that was formed by underwater eruptions and similar to rocks found on the Atlantic Ridge today.  It is a truly unique formation.  Other rocks on the beach are also ancient.  The pretty red or green pebble you may find be 150 million years old.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVop_JBYuqiKEX-LtUdq52CqHTEaKZv1KAHQJy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

On Saturday we went in and it was packed in that tiny little enclosed space. Completely unacceptable. Merely putting floor stickers on the floor reminding people to social distance is not enough, management should have incorporated a maximum person in store capacity and enforced it. No one was social distancing, there was no room to do so due to all the people in the room.</Review>

<Review>I've never been big on B&R to begin with, but we decided to try this location out today. It was very small and cramped. Wish there was a lot more space for seating and ordering. That being said my 2 year old loved the ice cream, not that she's hard to please in that regard. My grandma hated it on the other hand, while my mother seemed happy enough. I'd just stick with Cold Stone or better yet just buying ice cream from a grocery store. 🤷🏾‍♀️<//Review>< Date>

Pretty awesome, girls are always nice but busy. Probably the best neighborhood ice cream place. The owner is nice, friendly plus always tries hard to decorate birthday cakes.<//text>

<review>I love that there are still ice cream shops around.  They have a great selection of ice cream and also make personalized cakes.  They also have some pre-made cakes as well that you can just grab and go if you're in a hurry.  The primary issue with this place is the prices! I think a small cup of ice cream cost $7.  I'm pretty sure I can buy a pint or more for that price from a grocery store.  I'd still rather come here to get an ice cream cake though, those are the best!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Yummy! I ordered the double scoop mint n chip and very berry strawberry and got my Free Waffle cone! Abby was really nice and helpful there were a few customers and both the girls there worked well together and took care of us well. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have some type of brownie icecream besides the sundae. There still is a good selection of flavors, and I'd much rather go here then the DQ up street, it's horrible at that DQ on redlands Blvd!<//Text>

I usually go to this Baskin-Robbins when I need me some Baskin-Robbins, and I never thought to post a review one way or the other. But, having now been in a number of other BR establishments culminating in Mocha Cappuccino Blast With Armpit, I can definitively say this is the cleanest BR of them all, with excellent service and lovely employees. I did not realize what I was taking for granted before, but now I do, and I'm positively delighted that this BR is the closest one to me. A truly wonderful example of excellent service and, most importantly, spotlessly clean hygiene. Oh, and the owner (or maybe the co-owner or owner's wife, I'm not 100% which of them actually owns it) is a gem of a woman. <3<//Text>

I love ice cream. What I love most about Baskin-robbins is the 31 flavors I get to choose from. This BK has been in Redlands as long as I can remember. The employees are always friendly, and the service is top notch. There is very little seating inside (4 two-person tables) but there are at least 8 benches, with shade, on the corner outside. By far, my favorite flavor is World Class Chocolate. It combines a milk chocolate and white chocolate ice cream into an incredible creamy creation. If you are ever in downtown Redlands and you need a cool treat, head on over to 31 flavors and get your fill of fabulous ice cream. As always, your mileage may vary!< /Text>

Looks really nice, fresh and new. I had stopped by over christmas for some gift cards and the wall I just mentioned was being torn down from the old full wall menu and pics of product... I wa curious of the new design. I'm impressed.....

I got a double scoop cup of chocolate fudge ice cream and as I was eating it there were little clearish-white slivers of what looked like coconuts and they claimed that they didn't know what it was. we then got a refund and left because of the unknown "add-ins" in the chocolate fudge ice cream.< /review>

Typical Baskin Robbins ice cream. Location makes it a quick stop when walking downtown with the kids. Prices are noticeably more expensive than other locations. Terrible sewer smell outside makes it difficult to enjoy ice cream outside and there are very few tables inside.< /Text>

Horrible service. My son's were next to be served, short Asian lady ignored them, and helped other people instead. I told her my kids were next in line, she ignored again. I then left, called, to speak to owner, a woman by the name of Nina, picked up and said, she was manager, and that she was there. It turns out that the lady that ignored us was the owner Nina! You can keep your ice cream I'm going somewhere else.</Review>

< review>
I don't understand why a place that serves one thing, ice cream, would be this dirty. Why would anyone stand in a line for dirty ice cream? And I understand that young kids need work experience, but hiring brain dead high schoolers may not be the best for business. If you're gonna do that at least hire the airheads who are nice and easy on the eyes. After 3 minutes in this store I had to leave and I'll never be back. Just like everything else in this pretentious town it's only pretty on the surface, when you look past the facade you see the ugly.< /review>

I keep giving this location a chance but the staff is always rude or just seem like they hate their job. Took a trip today 20 mins before they closed (gf cravings) and the female employee claimed they were closed, with attitude ofcourse. Disappointing.<//text>

< Review>
I had gotten some desert for myself at market night and the kids wanted iced cream so we came here, but the girl was very pushy that I leave because I had "outside food" and wouldn't serve me until I took it out. Was I supposed to have my 3 year old stand outside with my food while I buy them iced cream?<//Review>

Seriously, you call this ice cream? Walk down the same street and go to A LA minute. Youll taste the difference between junk food (baskin) and ice cream< /Review>

<text>Called to place ice cream cake order & it was so bad I asked for gm and she was RUDE and short with me & I just told them I wouldn't give them my business with that attitude. How hard is it to take an order. anyways, ended up placing my order at the other Baskin Robbins off Boulder and baseline. Will never ever give them my business again.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

One of the few places in ob to buy groceries. The staff is notorious for being super slow. The staff doesn't like people using the restroom there and half the time the bathroom is out of order. It's open 24/7.< /text>

I’ve read a few complaints about this location but I’ve always found the cashiers and staff to be very nice and extremely helpful. Sometimes the line gets slow but almost always another checker will come up and run 2 cash stations simultaneously, equaling 3 checkouts. Everything stays stocked pretty well too. My only complaint is homeless in the parking lot or out front.< /Text>

We’re locals and can attest that this store has everything. Their store brand products are the best! Shop their post-holidays sales for the lowest prices and best deals. Last minute gift? They have everything you need; gift, card, tissue/wrap, gift bag, done. The staff here will help you no matter the time of day or night. Show up in your pj’s or a costume - they don’t bat an eye.<//Review>

Nikki from the Pharmacy was SOOOOO helpful and called me several times to explain the ins/outs of what I needed from insurance as well as recognized me voice when I came in to pick up my medication. She is extremely warm and hospitable which is much appreciated, especially when dealing with a pharmacy. Thank you Nikki, RiteAid is lucky to have such an awesome and professional employee!<//review>< Date>

<Text>If you need toilet paper or cleaning supplies. They usually have some available. The place is always clean and the staff is very friendly. I usually go to the CVS across the street but going forward I think I’ll shop here instead.<//Text><Date>1594049944348< /Date><Name>Andy Walker</Name>< Pics>

This location has a pharmacy that caters to elderly and high risk to covid-19 patients, upon entering this establishment a huge sign regarding masks is directly in front of entrance. I'm in this establishment every week and every single time I've been in here, people walk in without wearing a mask and no one says anything. From the time a non mask wearing individual enters to their exit of premises. I have not witnessed one incident where an employee has said  anything to the customer even while they are paying at the register. I sincerely feel bad for the elderly and high risk people that receive their medications here.<//text>

I've been going to this Rite Aid for years, and it's always been my favorite. The employees seem to remember me, though I'm only there every few months, and the checkers are efficient.<//Text>

Worked there as a front end cashier for a few months and it was a priviledge to work at such a wonderful location and with such a great and kind staff. Miss all of you guys. Sending lots of love from the Czech Republic to the team and customers!</Review>

1. They are not open 24 hours, as it says above in the description
2. I have to use this pharmacy because it's the only drug store in OB. I've been going for 5/6 months and literally every single month, my prescriptions are not right. Essentially, I always have to call and remind them to refill one of them (I only have two prescriptions...). It would be nice if they could get it right at least once.< /text>

The cashier knows me, I usually buy cigarettes. He was going to grab my pack, but he didn't give it to me because my ID was expired and I had the Dmv paperwork with me which makes my ID valid. I have been buying cigarettes for a year at this rite aid store, till yesterday and they didn't make any kind of issues until today. They lost a good costumer with the gold card ... goodbye</Text>

Nice place but when I went there recently, although they weren't busy, I couldn't find any carts or baskets to put my items in. If I am shopping, a cart would be very useful.< /review>

This Rite Aid has the most disgusting bathrrom I've seen in a while. Smells bad. Dirty. Pee build up. The TP rolls were on the ground. No seat covers. Mold and water mineral build up on sink. So gross.< /text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>If you don't have to use RiteAid because of insurance, DON'T.  Go to CVS on Santa Monica & Cable St. instead. The pharmacy staff is much friendlier and efficient and the wait for non-Rx registers is much shorter. When I went on Medicare,  I had to change to RiteAid because of my insurance. Even though all my prescriptions are at the Niagara location, they wouldn't give me the secondary shingles vaccine (they had been out of it for months) because I didn't get my 1st shot there. I may opt to pay the extra $$ to have my prescriptions filled at CVS.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>This is the only drug store in town, which is why it is always crowded.  There is always at least 6 people in line and never more than 2 registers open.  I took back a $15 mop that fell apart after 1 use and did not keep the receipt because I did not think I would need it.  They would only give me $7 for it, since this is I guess the lowest the mop has ever been sold.  Even to do this a manager had to be involved.  I know it must really hurt business for the $8 difference, even if it put a bad taste in the mouth of a customer.  Then for Chrismas I found a whole isle of things on special, according to the huge yellow signs all over it saying 50% off.  I expected to pay $20 bucks for the items that I chose.  But once after i waited in a long line and got to the register, the bill was $75 because none of the items were in the correct places for which the price was shown, nor was any of it on sale.  I even took the manager over and showed him the isle, for which he said things must have been moved around by customers.  Even after I pointed out there is a stack of them with a price right in front of it. Why would a customer shift the whole isle around?  I will not go back.<//text>< pics>

I use to live across the street from this Rite Aid-- so unfortunately, I had little choice but to shop here sometimes. The cashier ALWAYS made rude personal remarks about the items I was buying. They never knew where to find things or would tell me they didn't have something, but after searching for a long time-- I'd find it.
One extremely rude remark was made when my husband and I were trying to conceive. I ran down to Rite Aid to buy a pregnancy test (because I was SO excited that I might be pregnant). The cashier kept trying to refer me to  Planned Parenthood. When I tried to laugh off her insensitive remarks, she made a comment that heavily implied that I should get an abortion...
I stopped shopping there immediately, and I'm so glad I moved away from Ocean Beach so I could take my business elsewhere.
Shame on you, Rite Aid cashiers.</review>

The pharmacy is NOT open 24 hours, only it's Rite Aid store is.  The web is incorrect in listing it as a 24 hour pharmacy.</Text>

I have been going to Vs for several years. Dan has been my guy almost the entire time.  He is meticulous, detailed and clearly takes great pride in his work. All of the staff are courteous and friendly. Might cost a touch more than the chain haircut joints but worth every penny.< /text>

Plastic partitions separated just stations & barbers all wore masks & some wore shields. Very thankful they have reopened.</Text></record>

After being closed for the virus, I visited on Friday for a haircut with Dan, and would continue to highly recommend this barbershop! They have all the required protocols in place, but that only detracted slightly to the great overall experience and service typical of this establishment!<//Text>

I received a great haircut from Hamid today.  He's really friendly and professional but more importantly he has incredible barber skills.  V's also has an app that works very well and allows you to schedule appointments.  My wife loves the way I look and smell when I come home too.  It's my new barbershop.</text>

This barbershop has a classic old world feel  with a sports theme that caters to guys. You'll be offerred a water or beer, and there are individual televisions at each station if you want to watch something. No ungodly chemical stink when you walk in thank goodness, one of my pet peeves.

I've had several barbers here, my favorite is Hamid, who always does an excellent job. The real selling point though is that my wife says Hamid cuts my hair better than anyone ever has. That's the best endorsement I can think of. You can expect a bit of pampering here, hot towels, short massage, etc. but this is still a barbershop and not a salon. I like that.

They do offer shaves and such that I haven't taken advantage of yet, maybe I will at some point.

The owner is usually present who mans the front end. He's personable enough and it's nice to see he cares to  keep a watch over his business.

Bottom line: great place for a cut, and try Hamid😊< /text>

Dan was great as always and provides the best clipper cut fade in the OC.   Kent is the friendliest and hardest working owner/operator you will find. Kent also supports the community.

I would highly recommend this V's location, Dan and Kent.

I've been going to V's in Foothill Ranch since moving to the area about 18 months ago. Every cut has been great. I've been seeing J and he does an amazing job. Great attention to detail, great conversation. Every single time I get one of the best cuts I've ever had. Do yourself the favor if you're looking for a new barber, you won't be sorry!< /Text>

My 14 year old son likes this place because of the atmosphere and the friendly customer service.  He has had different barbers and says they all do a great job! He is very happy. It is a clean and upbeat barber shop! Highly Recommend!<//text>

<date>1542236830207<//date><Rate>5</Rate><text>There is something to be said about someone who takes their job and in this case "craft" very seriously. You don't have to be a Dr or lawyer in this world to be successful, having a trade is to be admired. In this case I'm talking about a gentleman named Nampo. He's first chair at V's and deserves it. I can't speak to his skills concerning cutting hair because he only gave me a straight razor shave and a facial massage. He did however, without asking, put his personal touch fine tuning my neck and hairline. Square cut wasn't good enough for him and I happily agreed. I've had a straight razor shave many times but Nampo's attention to detail was terrific. Plenty of hot towels, warm shave cream and a gentle touch made for a relaxing experience. The chair is old school and comfortable. The confidence he had in handling the blade showed many years of experience. When he was done he put some sort of liquid mask on my face that tightened up every last pore. It was an interesting feeling as the mask dried and almost stretched my face tight. That was removed by another hot towel followed by several more lotions and a fall asleep massage. Cost $35 shave + $35 massage. Time 1 hour. Value worth every penny!<//text><user>112988063776526940803</user>< Resp>

I love this Barbershop! All the barbers are friendly and good cutters. Dan is the man I choose for my cuts. He is not only very friendly but an excellent barber.
I love the look and feel of the shop too! It's just like the shops I used to go to when I was a kid! Great atmosphere and kid friendly!</Review>

<Text>Got the full service shave and a haircut from a former boxer who had really shaky hands and little confidence when it came to executing a haircut. Screwed up my haircut pretty badly. Cut my face up pretty badly in the shave, and didn't even get a clean shave. Incredibly overpriced for a terribly job. They should screen their barbers more.</Text><UserId.>100340884648663167986</UserId.>< username>

<Text>The man who pick up the phones (Bryan) says he is a manager. Gave me the worse experience while just making a appointment. I asked if they could do Africa America hair good and when was the fast I could get my haircut that same day.  Immediately I revived a very angry tone. This man was no happy at all asked him. Honestly as a Africa American man I would never set a foot in V’s barber shop the service they gave me was jaw dropping disrespect. Even started calling me a “kid” but never even see me and I’m 28 so I felt very disrespected and they will never get my service again.<//Text>< gmapID>

Stewart is by far the best Barber💈 I have ever worked with on creating and maintaining my ever changing hair styles. He has mad skills and I've never seen his equal. 💇🏻He also cuts my husband's hair and beard.. Frankly my husband hasn't ever looked as sharp as he does when he comes home from V's Barbershop. We are so thankful for Stewart👊We Never leave disappointed or feeling like we didn't get the best value for our money. He is pleasant, professional and a DANG GOOD BARBER🙌  Ask for him specifically and you'll never go anywhere else. 💪</text>

Look... I went here once and got a decent haircut from a barber named Napo. He did a clean job on a classic combover style haircut the first time. I went in the second time and asked him to define my part a little bit and give me a low fade. He had no idea what he was doing. His idea of a fade was to buzz one side of my head without any blending whatsoever. I literally could of taken a 2 guard and raked it through my hair to do the job he did. It is one of the worst haircuts I've ever had. I didn't  bother even fighting it, I paid and left. He even apologized for not doing what I asked but excused it by saying this is what the young kids like. I'm not a hipster in high school, I like a traditional clean cut look. Now I have to wait a month for my hair to recover. I'm truly embarrassed walking around in public this haircut and will not be going back. I'm sure there are other good barbers but Beware of Napo!< /Text>

Ive been going to Fred at V's Foothill Ranch for a few years now after switching from Hawleywoods. ( Love the guys at Hawley's, but its just a trek ) I've never been disappointed and always come out with exactly the cut I want.< /review>

Rude from the very first phone call,  but still decided to take a chance.  I should've listened to the other bad reviews, especially about Stewart.  He was rude and just sat there playing on his phone. If you want unfriendly service and a so-so haircut, this is the place.<//Review>

Walked in while 2 barbers were working, they look at me and don't say anything. I figured they were waiting for another employee to materialize from the back to help me. I wait 4 minutes and nothing.  They could have at least stopped and walked over or ask me what they could help me with.</Review>

Stayed on Venice beach for a 2 day stay and wanted some late night eats. Made it a half hour before close and they were so nice in still accommodating us. Ordered their Combination Fried Rice. Absolutely amazing presentation and some of the best fried rice ive ever had. My mate had their curry and only had good things to say. Highly recommend this place if your visiting or living nearby looking for good food.</Text>

Food is delicious. 5 stars. But...

Minus one star because I've only got a 50% success rate of getting "very spicy" when I order. Tonight I specified max spicy, saw "2 stars" on the receipt when I picked up my order, then got home to find no chili in my dish whatsoever. I got more of a burn from my piping hot soup than I did from my main dish.

Please. When I say "extra spicy" I MEAN IT. Don't give me Midwestern White Guy spicy. It's enough to make me stop ordering.<//Text>

This place used to be my favorite Thai spot, but they renovated during the pandemic and added a new seating area and it appears that they cannot keep up with the increase of dine in customers.  I have ordered from here 3 times in the past month and every time it takes at least twice as long as the wait time they give you.  The first time I went back it took an hour and 20 minutes for egg rolls and a noodle dish (they were packed I will give them that) the second time I went back I gave them an extra 10 min until I drove over to get my food and they forgot to put in my order they said it will be ready in 10 minutes, I come back and they forgot to put in my order the second time as well, making me wait around an hour and a half again, for egg rolls and a noodle dish, this last time I went they gave me a 30 minutes wait time, I came 30 min late anticipating the super long wait, and still had to wait another 30 min in the restaurant so it took them an another hour and a half to make my food and they skimped me on an egg rolls on top of all of that, once again this place used to be my favorite Thai place, but because of these experiences I’ve had since the remodel I cannot say that I will be returning even though the food is amazing I cannot deal with the wait times being 3X longer than they tell me and skimping me on top of all of it.  Hope you guys can get it together at some point.</text>

One of the better restaurants in the Venice area. Charming location on the canals. Often a wait on weekend nights. My favorites here are the spicy steak salad and the curries.< /review>

I eat a lot of Thai food, but this one hit the spot! The curry was the perfect portion size, and the flavour was everything I wanted. Definitely recommend masaman curry !</Text>

<text>We went in June 2020 for a family vacation. Stayed close by as we wanted to walk to the beach, and the pier and then we found this gem right near the beach. We actually ate here twice as the food was so good and the drink selection was solid. Service was good but not outstanding.

I ordered the fried calamari, fried rice, coconut shrimp and tom yum soup. The portions and the food was very disappointing especially for the price.  Not much flavor. I've been recommended this place by my godmother especially since I live so close. I'm sorry to say I won't be returning.<//text>

Small restaurant next to the Venice Canals. Food was excellent! I'm giving it a 4 because only outdoor seating is available. Umbrellas provide shade. The green curry was nice and rich , not watered down. And their papaya salad and angel wings were flavorful and delicious as well!< /text>

Excellent service and quality!

The menu was clean and organized. Finally a menu with lots of nice pictures of foods. Excellent and so helpfulI. I wish other restaurant's menu could have more pictures.

The staff were kind and helpful.

As we entered in to the restaurant during lunch time, many visitors were there to eat.

We were quickly helped to sit down at a table and right away and another waitress came to receive our order.

We ordered several different dishes. The food were hot, fresh and tasted excellent!

The amount of salt in the food was ok but the amount of sugar in salads and other dishes were more than expected. We wish the sugar could be less and they could serve some sugar at side so the customer themself can decide how much sugar they want to add.

The waiting time from order to be served was ok.

The restroom:
We didn't see any restroom. Does this place have restroom?

Here are some pictures I took.<//Text>

Very good Thai food with wonderful service. Tasty dishes, including lots of less common ones. Mostly outdoor seating, hence the name "Garden- so dress accordingly if it's cold (they do have heat lamps). Not sure what they do when it rains!< /Review>

What a wonderful place.  We stopped here after touring the Venice Canal houses.  We had the Krispy Ka Prao Chicken and the Roasted Duck Curry with a side of white, steamed rice.

First, the ambiance is just amazing. We sat outside, our table overlooking the canal, a fresh breeze lightly blowing in on a warm and sunny winter day.

The chicken was tender, falling off the bone, with a sticky, crispy skin and crispy basil. I probably could have eaten another entire serving.  The curry had a beautiful kick of spice to it and the duck was tasty.

The service was great too.  The server kept our water glasses full and checked in on us several times.

We would definitely return here again.<//text>

<text>The food here is fantastic but the service can be somewhat inattentive. We waited more than 15 minutes for cutlery that never came even after we asked for it. I ended up getting some myself. No one offered us water when our glasses were empty. Having said that, this is still my favourite Thai restaurant in LA. It's reasonably priced and absolutely delicious.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

The service is friendly and go out of their way to help with dietary restrictions. I was able to order salmon larb and Thai iced tea with coconut milk instead of cream based. Everything was delicious and served in a timely manner. I also appreciate the fact that I didn't need a reservation. I highly recommend this restaurant.<//Review><Time>1491274882150< /Time><userid>109974116125693061887< /userid></record></dataset><record>

A great mini restaurant, great food and great service. I recommend two plates: 1. Thai soup whit seafoods 2. Phat Thai noodles, simply spectacular with a great atmosphere The beer is wonderful and the Te too. Not conventional food but simply delicious. I recommend too the Thai Ice Te and after lunch you can walk between the Venice canals.< /review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>Considering I was the only one at the restaurant when I got there for lunch, the service was very slow. I had the pad Thai and the sticky rice with mango for dessert: the pad Thai was forgettable - nothing about it would make me want to try it again or make a strong recommendation for it. The rice from the sticky rice with mango was clearly undercooked. In all, if you are in the area and want Thai food, consider looking elsewhere.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFdJg7T9nc7QVxvocy4mKAJC2RKst5Q2cuA6dC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMyAVP6KZIxjIbKmSvpAMv8PatEAyr8md78z-yP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzGKo97WdFiolpQQZNNDtjrLRAUDouYpDPQbud=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODZyZSIyMMuNhBR0bCGCVIWZF5gVlrwWK1zOxf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO82eQmERcGrIyanj1JO9TPmbq9aBI5l6b4zxKl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

Superb, authentic Thai food. We cook and travel internationally a lot and are choosy about where we eat, but this restaurant was so good we ate here two days in a row.

For salads, we loved the glass noodle salad as well as the papaya salad (Som Tum). The Siamese Hot Pot Delight soup is delicious and lovely. The Deep Sea Diamond from the specialty menu was also great. Even the mango sticky rice had a special touch. Oh, and their fresh coconuts are delicious! Very fresh.

The patio is lovely in good weather and they have kind service.<//text>

Amazing place! I got the pineapple fried rice and my wife got the #2 pad see ew. The rice there is amazing and the pad see ew comes with flat noodles and they were great. We both got beef so not sure on the other meats but it was fantastic. The service was eh just two people handling busing and serving so we only had two interactions he took our order for food and drink and the food being brought and we found them for the check. Food though was five stars!< /Text>

A bit pricey but the food is delicious. Ordered a papaya salad(requested spicy, but came medium spicy for my taste), beef satay came in 5 little skewers(11.95), eggplant with tofu and sweet and sour beef and a large rice (5$).</text>

EXCELLENTE! We had a pad Thai and pad sew. My boyfriend was kind of full, so we could not try their HOMESTYLE coconut cake.</review>

Food is 5 stars but the service is 0. No eye contact, fake smiles. We ask for mild rice for the children, and they made it extremely spicy. It was ridiculous. Take away maybe? Because delicious food.</review>

You can order spiciness one two or three. 3 is quite hot for the average person so don't recommend unless you are used to that heat level. This is not a glamorous place and could probably use some updating but it is always tidy and the bathroom clean. Super convenient if you want to walk the canals or after hanging out at mother's or Venice Beach.</review><Response>None< /Response>< rate>

The very best part; ending the day after a long walk seeing the sights. While we didn’t even remember what we ate (the food was F.A.B.) it was the warm welcome hospitality that was the most memorable for this Midwestern couple. Will definitely come back!</Text>

<text>2/12/2021 Update: Got the drunken noodles again, and they were much better and way more flavorful. And the service was much better too! Updating the rating to 4 stars.

Slow and inattentive service. Charged extra for rice when you order curry (although that might be a thing at Thai restaurants out here). That's like charging for noodles when you order spaghetti. Bland drunken noodles. Seems like a tourist trap.< /text>< userid>

< Review>
Great little place right on the side of the canals walkway. Seated in a timely manner outside. The staff was hurrying around and doing their job. We ordered 2 entrees, this is where the problem started. My Pad Thai arrived in about 10 minutes, quick for how busy they were however my guest ordered the Emerald Curry arrived 15 minutes after mine. When questioned about this the staff had no excuse and just said sorry. This to me is totally unacceptable and a total failure on the front and back of house communication. The food was great, the timing was terrible.< /Review>

The portions are small, but delicious. Very cozy place, but there is some indoor seating. Don't come here if you have plans for later on a weekend though; they are often short-staffed and I've been here enough times to say that you will be here at minimum 1.5 hours.</review>

< review>
Was meeting family here for lunch today (Mother's Day). My daughter and I waited  by the entrance but no one greeted us. While my family was finding parking, I took my daughter, who has a medical condition, to use the restroom. I'm waiting outside the restroom and this server runs up to me and YELLS at me that the restroom is for customers only. I told her we were customers but the rest of the party was parking. She continued to YELL at me that I should have waited and should have asked before going to the bathroom. After she finished yelling I called my family and told them we couldn't eat there because we felt so unwelcome. Who does that? I get it, you're not a public bathroom but we were customers who were never greeted and to yell at a child and her parent for using the restroom, please. Get over yourself lady. It's not that serious. Never going back again< /review>

Yeah, I eat a lot of Thai food, and this spot did not pass my Lad Nar test. Pricey for what you get. I suppose you're paying for the garden setting.</Text>

Was looking forward to a romantic dinner in this small intimate restaurant. A total disaster!! My husband's food arrived, and after 20 minutes of waiting for my dinner, I finally asked the waiter in charge about my dinner. He informed me that the chicken I had ordered took 20 minutes and the  waitress was new, and had not informed me the wait. I told him she should not have brought my husband's dinner way before mine was ready! I did not receive my dinner, and eventually asked the waiter to cancel my order as my husband was finished eating. I asked for something already prepared and choose the chicken sticks and friedrice. I received a huge mound of rice and 4-5 chicken sticks. My original order had not been removed from the bill! We finally settled the bill and it was $20.00 for my part, which was 4-5 chicken sticks and some refried rice. No comp was given for the long delay!! Would never go back to that restaurant!!<//review>

Pretty good. A little overpriced for what you get, but still pretty reasonable considering this is right off the boardwalk. Friendly service, though a little slow.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>After 5 visits still returning.  Great food & reasonable prices, service, location, 😀We take visitors here occasionally & one couple from San Francisco insisted on a re-visit on their last trip.  My wife, self & son come here several times per year and always enjoy the location, food and service.  I noticed several unhappy reviews, perhaps that arrive with an attitude problem, anyways we look forward to return visits.<//Text>< gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) After admiring the canal, we walked into this lovely Thai restaurant to have a meal. We sat in an outdoor location, surrounded by beautiful plants, and we could enjoy fireworks while eating.
We ordered fried shrimp, fried chicken wings, spring rolls, fried rice, green curry and Thai rice, which were unexpectedly delicious! The waitress was very enthusiastic to ask whether our spicy level was acceptable, the service was great and delicious, and a family of four left with a full meal

欣賞完運河，走進這間可愛的泰國餐廳用餐，我們坐在戶外的位置，周圍種滿了各種植物很美，一邊吃飯還可以欣賞到煙火。
我們點了炸蝦、炸雞翅、春卷、炒飯、綠咖哩和泰國米，出乎意料之外很好吃喔！服務小姐很熱心詢問我們的辣度能否接受，服務很棒也好吃，一家四口吃得飽飽的離開<//Text>

<Text>Purchased a used 2020 Impreza sport on 5/13/2021. It is under the 3/36 factory warranty. The vehicle itself only has 8501 on the odometer. Made an appointment through the portal for 5/14/2021 @ 11:30am. Arrived @ 11:15 was not greeted well. Explained that the speakers do not work is reason for the visit. I have never been dismissed so quickly by a service advisor or dealer in my life. I will never ever frequent this dealer and warn others to find a better local dealer to use for service. If the treatment is because this is not a customer pay repair and a warranty repair that made the advisor not value me and my issue. Shame on you!  Highly disappointed and dis-valued. I hope this is not the beginning of how Subaru treats all warranty customers.< /Text><user>100977366731335535812< /user>< rating>

If you ever get the opportunity to work with Uncle Ben you will find that he's absolutely the best. He is friendly, kind and will patiently walk you through their inventory without any pressure. Big thank you to him and Subaru's financial team for making the whole process easy.<//review>

<Review>Our sales person, Sean, was amazing. We felt he was very transparent and up front. He helped us get a great deal!  There was no haggling of any sort. No gimmicks, or hassle. We never felt forced or pushed to make a deal. We feel we got such a good deal, we definitely will go back to buy another car in the future.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I recently bought a beautiful 2020 Subaru Forester, and was fortunate enough to have worked with salesman Shane.  Shane was very pleasant to deal with.  He was respectful, upfront, and very responsive to my inquiries leading up to the sale.  Overall, it was a very friendly, low-pressure, and fairly hassle-free transaction.  The only wish I really have about the dealership is for them to finish the darn remodeling/construction job already! 😁</text>

Our salesman, Sahand, was patient while we were looking into what we wanted. He was  personable and incredibly nice. He was not pushy which was a huge breath of fresh air. He was eager to help and answer any questions we had. Overall, it was a pleasant, mostly hassle free, low pressure experience. We left pleased with the experience and the deal we walked away with. The new building is incredible. It's very clean and has great customer amenities.< /Review>< Pics>

My mother recently bought a Subaru at Stevens Creek Subaru and she worked with Sean Soliamani. I have to say that the level of service and caring she received was seriously awesome. Sean went above and beyond by not only holding on to my moms new car for a couple of weeks while she sorted out returning her leased vehicle to another company/dealership (who I won’t name but are absolutely terrible), but he also went out of his way to ensure my mom felt as though her time and her business was truly valued. My mom is ESL so sometimes it’s hard for her to understand certain things and it takes a little extra level of patience and over communicating to help her out. Sean did exactly this. He spent extra time showing and explaining all of the features in the car and how to use them. He also offered to make himself available any day he is working to be a resource for her if she has an questions. He never showed any frustration. He never made her feel like her questions weren’t important. He always maintained a polite and positive attitude along with a great level of personable professionalism. If you’re thinking about getting a Subaru (they’re great cars!) go to stevens creek Subaru and work with Sean. You will not regret it!< /Review>

We had an excellent experience from start to finish at Steven’s Creek Subaru. Our sales associate, Ben was extremely helpful and welcoming and we did not feel pressured at all by anyone we came in contact with. We went in with a plan and the sales team was able to get us exactly the deal we wanted. We left the lot with an amazing vehicle and I believe we are going to be lifelong Subaru owners and will be shopping for our future vehicles here.< /review>

I came into the dealership late one evening and Mike was welcoming and listened to what I was looking for. He set up a time for me to drive the cars I wanted later that week. When I came in for my purchase he worked with me to show me all my options and ensure that I knew what I was buying and I was getting what I needed. After deciding on the car, finance and sales were easy and amazing to work with. Felt like I was treated as a customer instead of a sale.</Text>

<Text>I felt that both me and my car were in good hands with Ernesto, and he was very detailed and clear about the work that was done. I was told that I needed to schedule a time to come in and have my rear struts replaced. He had already ordered the part before I got a chance to call! Absolutely happy with my service.</Text>< name>

Recently purchased the 2021 Subaru outback and I had good experience with Stevens Creek Subaru Salesperson: Mr. Jeff Sizemore. Lot of salesperson’s try to convince the customer but he is the one, who listen to the customer with good patience.
Jeff taken care of entire purchase process till delivery very smoothly. He is very kind, and he is the only reason, I brought my vehicle from Stevens Creek Subaru.< /Text>

Service Department - I'm very disappointed with the service department. I have been going there for years, and have had relatively good experiences. However, the last time I went there they completely ripped me off. I went in for a 120,000 mile service, and was charged over $1,7000. When I went in for my 60,000 mile service (which is the same thing), it was under $600. I didn't realize how ridiculous the price was until after I had already paid, because I figured I could trust them after the years of good service. Guess not<//Text>

Quick and painless transaction. The dealership made the process easy. Sean is a trustworthy gentleman that listened to our needs right from the start. We negotiated everything via email and over the phone and then went to the dealership to trade-in our old Subaru Forester. Sean went above & beyond by going to the dealership on his day off and staying after hours. Final price was exactly as negotiated. Manager tried to convince us to add some paint protection and warranty but we didn’t feel any pressure to purchase. No games, and was professional when we said no. Sean and their financing officer were attentive to customer's needs. Look for Mr. Sean Soliamani. We had an exceptional buying experience. Thank you.</Text>

<text>I purchased bumper clips on the day a after Thanksgiving last week. The staff quoted me initially for $5.17 each, then immediately said " I can give you for $4.17 each". I was a bit happy but also suspicious about the price drop. I picked up some any way. Later I called the Subaru car dealer in Fremont, they charged only $2.65 a piece. Then I called in this dealer next day (Sat) asking about the return for credit, the staff told me I had to wait till next Mon because it required a manager to approve the re stock charge for credit. What kind of service is this! That is not right. I will avoid to do any business with the part department of this dealer.<//text>< pictures>

<review>I feel cheated. I've gone here for 5 years! Each time your team tries to trick me out of using my large service plan and tries to get me to use the least expensive option for you and least amount of service for me. Then the first time I arrive after expiration of my service package your team adds everything under the sun to my car. I'll never go here again. And I'll be sharing my experience and the lack of empathy from Jose and gauging that takes place here. Shame on you for doing that to customers.</review><username>Becky Tremann<//username></record>

We went to several Subaru as we were looking for a manual transmission Crosstrek, which was difficult and rare to find. We found a certified used car via websites and went to test drive. The color and everything else matched our criteria. We deal with Hossain. who helped test drove the car as we do not know how to drive manual car. He was professional and courteous, very patient answering all of our questions. We ended up buying the car and also met the manager Pedram, a very nice young man who also helped us with the purchase. We have one of the best experience in buying car thru the dealership, which was rare. The service department was really excellent too! We dealt with Jose, Kevin and team. They really took good care of us and buying a pre certified use car that still have warranty was a life saver. Thank you for taking a good care and providing us with top notch customer service!!< /review>

Tried to buy a car during December and had a horrible experience. Called ahead for an appointment to test drive and was assured the car would be ready and waiting. When I arrived and asked for the person I spoke to on the phone, she was no where to be found. Another sales person said he'd bring the car right over, and to wait outside. We sat in the sun for 30 minutes and then I called the person I had originally spoken with and asked what was going on. About 5-10 minutes later, the car finally arrived and the salesperson has a pretty unfriendly exchange with us. I test drove the car and then we got out as fast as we could. We ended up at Fremont Subaru the next day to buy and the experience was so much better.<//Review>

If you come at the right time.
With a patient respectful thought.
That the salesman try to sell a car that is right for you.

A price is a price, but a ride is a journey.

In a suburu...

<Text>Taz was by far the most amazing car experience I've ever had! I've bought over 4 cars before(not much, I know but between the wife and I) each car at a different dealership and I can say this transaction was the least hassle, the least stressful I've ever experienced! Taz right away made us feel comfortable and showed us what we thought we wanted then found what we truly wanted and kept us comfortable and at no point was it stressful. Taz is your man at Stevens Creek Subaru! And if you need more motivation, their selection of vehicles is outstanding! Between 4 lots and countless colors and trim packages! You won't go wrong!< /Text>< date>

Bought my car in Nov 2020 with Beau and discussed the details behind the Service package with William. Great people to work with! I never felt pressured.

I've had my 2020 Subaru Impreza Premium for 5 months now, and I absolutely love it! Previously I had driven a 2008 Saturn Ion and a 2013 Kia Rio, so this is a slight change for me. Overall, the one thing I love is how secure the car feels.

Also, I love that I can schedule my appointment with the MySubaru app. The reminders (via phone call) are very helpful as well. The associates are very kind to talk to. Lastly, I had bought the Service package when I bought my car, so dropping off my car for it's 6-month/6,000 mile service was so easy! The associate I worked with (David) was welcoming and helpful. I dropped off my car and it was done within an hour! The waiting area looked awesome, but I believe it was at capacity due to COVID-19 Safety Precautions (mad respect!) so I was unable to use it. Thankfully, a friend was able to pick me up and run some errands. Since this location is so close to Santana Row, there's seating one could find there as well.</text>

One of the best salesman ever works here! His name is Sean or Susan. We e-mailed each other about prices, and he honored it when we got there. When we looked at the car he explained how to work ALL the features in the car. He wasn't pushy at all. I went to another Subaru dealership that day, but they were not friendly. My husband asked a lot of questions (he's a mechanic) and Sean answered all of it. He even let us know that Subaru owners has their own parking lot in Tahoe! When my credit didn't go through he was gracious about it, even when he stayed back after his time off to meet with us! He still joked around with us. His customer for life!< /review>

Excellent buying experience. We worked with Taz; who was absolutely amazing. From start to finish, he was helpful and never pressured us. We ordered the car from factory and we picked it up onsite. The finance process was also done seamlessly and the whole process from test drive to leaving with the new car was only about 1.25- 1.5 hours. Very smooth process. It’s been a month (loving the STI!) and we still get follow-up calls making sure everything is well with the car and to make sure we didn’t need anything else. This is a very caring dealership. Lea also called to help us learn more about the car’s electronics etc. 10/10 recommend this dealership. I’m not sure about the service dept here though as I use another dealership closer to home. The only gripe is the small parking space but they are currently building a lot next store so that will be resolved shortly.</review>

<Review>Overall my experience here was pretty unprofessional. They negotiated a deal with me over the phone just to get me in the door. I went over the numbers with them for 2 hours in person. When I came and started signing the paperwork they were having me sign papers for a significantly higher price. When I asked them about it they suddenly couldn't do that deal anymore.

I negotiated a deal with them over the phone for a purchase. We went over the terms and numbers multiple times. When I came in person I went over the numbers with them again and started signing the paperwork I caught that they were having me sign paperwork for a lease. I questioned them about it and was told "That's just a minor error, the deal will still apply to the purchase".

When we got to the financing paperwork the price of the vehicle was thousands higher than we had negotiated. I told them the numbers were't accurate and we had just confirmed the numbers. Their response was "well that's the best we can do". When I asked what about our deal their response was "oh that? we can't do that".

This would be fine if we were still negotiating. But they waited till our negotiations were done and I was halfway through the paperwork to say they wouldn't honor our deal.<//Review>< pictures>

We enjoyed the ability to shop your inventory on line and get a quote before leaving the comfort of our home. This is especially important now that we are all dealing with the Cover 19 Virus. Once selecting likely vehicles we were able to set up an appointment for a test drive. The sales associate Jeff Sizemore who we worked with was very professional in working with us.  Even though we had made preliminary selection of the vehicle we were most interested in we ended up selecting an entirely different model and color. It allowed this to happen because there were a modest selection of different models and colors on the lot to compare.< /Text>

We worked with a salesperson who, although very knowledgeable and helpful, was also slightly pushy and intimidating, especially for the first time car buyers as we were. I'm sure if we worked with another salesperson our experience would have been amazing, because they clearly have a great inventory and make everything really easy for us.<//text>

In 2017 I purchased a Subaru Outback plus an extended warranty. We were told at the purchase we would be covered for 70,000 miles. Now we are being told it was only good for 42,000 miles. Plus since our purchase of our Outback 4 batteries have failed. Just to find out this has been an issue on the 2017 Outback Vehicles. So just to advise future customers that they are not standing behind their vehicles. Check the internet thousands of complaints on the batteries.</Text>

Upfront pricing, no pushing in anything. Sean answered all my question thoroughly and did what he promised, and Luis explained about the maintainance and warranty very detail without pushing me to purchase anything. Everything is clear and they let me decide the best for myself without breaking the budget, unlike other dealers that really want me to buy their warranty and maintenance.< /text>

Jorge Ocampo facilitated our sale smoothly and with no pressure. We purchased a preowned Mazda Miata that was competitively priced. He made sure the car was cleaned prior to our appointment and we appreciated that we didn't have to wait the extra time. Everyone was masked and hand sanitizer was available throughout the show room.👍<//Review>

<text>It was wonderful experience of buying at Stevens Creek Subaru.
Every thing was running in parallel and efficiently. No time wasted.
I find this dealership was good and straight forward. Literally in no time I made a good deal.

Taz Azim and Radek were fantastic guys and they both made our purchase a smooth and hassle free process. They not only updated me time to time about my factory order status, they handled pre-delivery process so well with all paperwork,  trade-in etc. At the end I am a very happy customer.

I would definitely recommend this dealership to my friends.< /text>< Name>

<text>Hossein Moghadasi and Pedram Shehni - THANK YOU!!! You made our Subaru experience at Stevens Creek totally worth the 1 hour drive from the Tri-Valley.  We had tons of dealerships to choose from: Sacramento to Fairfield to Daly City to San Luis Obispo.  I called and asked if you had a particular make and model available on the lot.  Hossein said yes, we came to a price agreement and you stuck to it and the deal was done!  You gave us an excellent price!  We also appreciate that you adhere to all Covid guidelines and take all necessary precautions to protect your customers.  We were in at 7:00pm and out at 9:00pm and heavy 1 awesome car.  This was the best, hassle free, “no bs”, test drive, credit check, final price then to Finance I’ve experienced (we have 4 cars now).  You got us the keys in under 2 hours.  I wonder how fast it would have been if I chose to complete the paperwork online?  I thank you, my wife thanks you and our soon to be arriving little angel Thanks you! I am comforted to know that my family will be protected traveling in this reliable, oober safe and very sexy Outback Onyx XT! Thank you Hossein, thank you Pedram, thank you to the entire Stevens Creek Subaru family!  We will spread the word!  I will be back...
And the icing on the cake, Hossein called today and asked if everything is ok with the car and if we had any questions or concerns.  WOW!!!  Now this my friends is the type of customer service that has been lacking in so many other businesses.  Something such as a two minute follow up goes a long way with customers.  Keep up the great customer service as you represent the Subaru name very well.  I appreciate you and my family appreciate you.

2021 Outback Onyx XT extremely satisfied and excited owners.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Had an appointment for some test drives after our car was totaled; waited 15 minutes and left due to safety concerns and poor service.

They're not enforcing mask mandates for customers despite signage saying it's required; no guidance or instructions on distancing or where to meet for scheduled appointments. A customer with no mask was milling around indoors for 10+ minutes without being asked to leave or put on a mask, so we left.

Lots of cars available, but was crowded and staff seemed overloaded without enforcing adequate precautions during a pandemic. Will likely buy elsewhere.</text>

Had 2 visit this service 2 times because of the same engine problem. First time the response was: "We cannot reproduce it and your car works perfectly".

<Text>Replaced transmission there due to CVT issues under 7000 mile which took 3+ weeks to complete.
Two weeks after the car was back it stopped in the middle of the road and cannot be restarted.  Had it towed back to the shop and found the ground wire for the starter fell off and the pitch stop bolt was not torqued correctly.
Furthermore, the car came back with a door ding and paint scratches this time.  Emailed and called many times without any response.
I will not recommend the service due to the sloppy repair and lack of responsibilities.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1598722264428, 'text': 'Michael, thanks for reaching out to us.

<rating>1<//rating><Review>They forced me to sign for maintenance plan saying it's possible to cancel anytime. Ok, I cancelled, 9 weeks later no money refunded after 2 calls they became "busy", don't reply and don't call back. Very dissapointing.

About their copy-pasted comment: after about 20 calls and emails there is no progress, they still didn't return the money.

Just avoid this people.

Edit: after 20 calls/emails they are not even going to return the money, just waisting the time. Now it's half year passed, no money. They continue to generate random answers.</Review>< pics>

<review>Took my BRZ in and turned out it needed a new engine harness. Jose Zambrana was great and the engine harness repair was huge but he helped us neutralize some of the cost impact. After the big job there were some issues, but Jose remedied it with a goodwill gesture right away. We are extremely happy with the Service and it has far exceeded our expectations. If you wanna service your Subaru definitely take it here and ask for Jose.</review>< pics>

It was easy.  Attitude was friendly.  The service was explained clearly.
Waiting room is nice along with the coffee.  It took about 30 minutes longer than anticipated, but that is no big deal.  I am very satisfied.

Super eager to make the sale, but no so much after the sale.  Not forthcoming with the car history or current condition. We drove three hours with our two little boys to buy from them.  So we didn't do our due diligence when it came to inspecting the 2017 Honda Pilot. We took care of all ther haggling online, and were eager to get back on the road. Car Fax was clean, but there were certainly other issues. Covered up rust and broken fog lamps. Now we're wondering what else will pop up. They aren't willing to share their intake inspections with us either.< /review>

The service team is very polite, attentive, courteous and efficient. Hector communicated every step with me ensuring I was in the know about what was going on with what work was being done to my car.
And due to the amazing loaner that was given to me, I'm now working with the internet sales team toward trading in my current Subaru for a newer 2020 outback.

I highly recommend this team in all areas. Best experience I've had with any car buying.< /Text>

Hi

Went for 12k mileage oil change and requested that I am getting only 23 MPG mileage. So they mentioned they will do some diagnostic testing and find out what is going on with mileage?. But at the end they just mentioned in the report that I need to use higher grade gas, no diagnostic testing. Only reason I bought this vehicle at the time of sales, I was told will 26 MPG in City and 32 MPG in Highway. It is no way near that advertised Mileage.

Also my Gas cap is broken and they ordered part. I got email that Part is arrived and I called multiple time to schedule appointment, no luck so far.

I am not happy with bot CAR and DELAR. and of course the Subaru Manufacture and EPA (government agency). I have already reported this mileage issue to EPA<//text>

David in service was very friendly and took care of my vehicle quickly. He addressed issues with me, and easily explained the plan of action for my vehicle in the future. I waited in the showroom with my 2 year old who enjoyed the toys that were out. Easy for me to keep an eye on him, but out of the way of people waiting who wanted to get work done. I am thankful for the ease of experience and I will certainly recommend to friends and be back for other services I will need in the future.<//Review>

<review>I recently purchased a Crosstrek and I had a really great experience working with Shane! I started speaking with Shane via email all the way back at the beginning of May. He was always very polite and was super patient with me as I went through the process of deciding what car I wanted, the color, options, etc. From start to finish, we emailed over 70 times across 4 months... I’ve never experienced that sort of patience and care from a sales rep before! It was greatly appreciated. The car I wanted wasn’t in stock, but it was really simple to get one ordered.

Another thing I really appreciated about working with Shane was how upfront and transparent he was with pricing, always giving me the best price from the start. I do a lot of research and have an understanding of the prices that are out there. It was clear after just a few emails that there was no need for me to shop around.  It was so nice to not have to haggle or check into fine print exclusions. I actually ended up ordering more options than I first intended to because the pricing was so good, there was no need for me to buy and install parts on my own.

When I came to pick up the car I had ordered, Shane already had everything setup for me and I was in and out in less than an hour. I also appreciated that the finance manager I worked with was easy going and there was no pressure to add on additional things that I was not interested in.

I’m really happy to have worked with Shane and to have purchased my new car with Stevens Creek!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<rating>1</rating><text>I purchased a 2015 Subaru Outback and get all of my services done at Stevens Creek. After the last service I noticed my wiper fluid and coolant was low. I called Stevens Creek and spoke to my customer service rep Cedric and he said multipoint inspections and oil changes never include topping off coolant although their website states, “all fluids topped off”. My receipt states the fluid was “ok”. I also checked for leaks, and no fluid to be found. I just don’t trust Stevens Creek anymore.

Also when I purchased my car I was told life time car washes with services, but the car wash has been “broken“ since 2015! But they are still willing to wash new cars for sale.

Amendment August 11, 2020 -- reply to owners message: No resolution, no solution to "...rectify the issues I experienced". Called the number the owner left on the review/reply and spoke to Kevin the Service manager. He said I can come in for a free fluid inspection, although I told him earlier that I had already purchased and topped off the fluids myself. He also stated they do top-off coolant and if it's very low they would note it in the checklist and inform me, which they did not. The subpar resolution was to talk to the service manager in the future whenever I encounter a problem with a future service.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Needed some bolts and clips for undermount part that was dangling under my 06 Outback. Thought I had figured out the correct parts but wanted to confirm with parts department. He confirmed and said the 8x18 bolt flange and clips were $5 something each but he was going to be nice and only charge me $4 per. Made me prepay with credit card as it was a special order. Went to pick up parts 4 days later, then doublechecked item and price by going to Subaru's parts.subaru website and the items are listed for $2.32 each. Helpful link to buy online from the very same dealer at that cost.
Did you guys really need to gouge me for double on a few parts? Last time I'll bring my car there.</Text>< pictures>

Initially engaged in conversation over email, we met the day I purchased the vehicle and completed the purchase in just over an hour. He knew the entire vehicle in and out and made sure I was well aware of every feature prior to driving off the lot. Also made sure the car was detailed to perfection before handing over the keys. Highly recommend him for any questions or concerns and can guarantee you will have a wonderful buying experience!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I was recently in the market for my first car. I knew the exact trim and accessories that I wanted. I emailed over 10+ Subaru dealerships and surprisingly many dealerships were not very responsive or many would not read the details of my email. Shane was one of the most helpful and reaponsive sales reps that I had contact with. I did not experience any pressure to buy and felt like the experience was very straight forward without any games.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>While I ended up getting a deal elsewhere, I was treated fairly and very professionally at Stevens Creek Subaru.  I do recommend this dealership.

I want to specifically mention Diana Kashapova who helped me along the way, was attentive, honest, and overall very helpful.  She provided answers to all my questions and followed up with me to check whether I had more. She is a great specialist and I highly recommend her for your future Subaru buying/leasing experience.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
The highlights:
- They still have not returned a refundable deposit after weeks, eventually stopped communicating
- They have a D- rating from the Better Business Bureau
- I would not trust them to give you a good/fair deal or have your best interest in mind

On my first visit I had a good experience with a salesperson. The specific make/mode I was interested in was not available at that time, so I put down a “fully refundable” deposit to put one on hold that was supposed to come in a few weeks later.

I ended up going with a different car for other reasons, so I called to get my deposit refunded. That was two months ago. I have still not received my deposit back.

I have called, emailed, gone through their customer service form on the website. When I have received a response, I have been told that the business office would process it “first thing.” Yet I have not received anything yet. This has been going on for weeks.

There’s no excuse for me not receiving my deposit back after this long. So I would caution anyone considering buying a car here that this place is running me in circles to hold onto $500 for a little longer. If you think that behavior means they’re going to give you an honest price and a good deal on a car... well, that’s your choice to make.</Review>

The staff is helpful and friendly. But us you are looking to get your car service I would recommend to shop around. I am amazed that  the prices on services change so much by advisor, and often the same advisor will give you different prices on a different day. (Next day)

I would give this place a 5 start if it wasn't for the lock of pricing transparency on their Services.</Review>

<Text>I've been in a few times recently.  Once was to get the AC repaired and they did a good job with this.

Recently I came in to fix a suspension problem.  It took a week to get the part in but once it was in they fixed it the next day.  I was able to just appear at the dealership early in the morning and they were able to address my issues.

The Service guys were exemplary.  They were quick to find out my complaint and address it promptly.  They were polite and pleasant.

<Review>[Nov 2020] Service is outrageously EXPENSIVE! Tire rotation, oil change costed and inspection costed me $157.77. Same service in Fremont Subaru costed me $88 including car wash, vacuum and they offered free cab service while dropping and picking up the car. It is twice as expensive and when asked for why it is so expensive, service manager says its because it in STEVEN CREEK so the labor is higher and you need to pay a PREMIUM. I would not recommend this place unless you want to shell out your money.
[June 2020] They will only service vehicles where they can make more money, they will not honor recalls. And the team is very rude and they are very money minded< /Review>< Response>

Updated 7/15/2019, downgraded to 2 stars

Worst service center I've ever been to. Staff/management at the service center have a bad attitude for customer service. Decided to give 2 stars since the work was done correctly, but basically everything else about my service experience was awful:

1. Was never called back with an estimate on cost or part delivery after scheduling online
2. Was turned away at my scheduled appointment time because of some random inspection
3. Came back a few hours later only to find out the part I needed was not in stock and would then take a few more days to order (see comment #1) and promised the have repairs done by Thurs of the same week.
4. Receive phone call on Thurs to tell me the part is in and schedule appointment, then told that next available appointment is the following week.
5. Ask to speak to a manager, nobody answers the phone. Manager doesn't call back themselves and pushes it off to someone else (obviously doesn't care about their customers)
6. Finally have service done the following week, no status updates as end of day and close of business for the service center is approaching.
7. Repairs were done correctly (although technically not even done by Steven's Creek Subaru, a 3rd party comes in to replace windshields).

This wasn't the first time I've had issues here, but is definitely the last. Will absolutely never come back to this service center.<//Review>

<text>Disrespectful and a passive aggressive sales staff, shady management, and a overall horrible car buying experience. I was extremely open to doing business with this dealership  but, they made it impossible to do any more business with them. They sold me a car with unreported damage, didn't include a front license plate, didn't include a spare key (even though they said they could sell me one - of course), and when you call them they never resolve the issues and depend on you to come in to resolve the issue in person or hand them more money. They obviously don't care about their customers best interest and only care about money. Do business with Capitol or Santa Cruz Subaru, they have friendly and respectful staff who are in it for their customer best interest.< /text><Name>lukas lange</Name>< Rate>

Price negotiation was short and simple - he gave me a ballpark offer by email and then we looked at the Kelly Bluebook price range the day of and nocked a few dollars off. No hassle. I feel like I got a good deal and I definitely got the car I want.
I visited the service station. Making an appointment was easy and the person on the phone was quite friendly. They identified my issue right away and went out of their way to sort everything out quickly. I am extremely impressed.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Very bad customer experience.

Did not guarantee a loaner vehicle for the repair for an urgent recall service... Even though this is stated clearly as an offer in the recall notice.

Also reported the repair would take a few days when the recall says the repair is a 1-4 hour service.

Generally not helpful at resolving these issues<//Review>

<Text>I usually have very short wait times for my car being serviced. I appreciated the location a bit more this time around since the service took a while due to the service center being swamped on a Saturday morning. I got to walk over to one of the movie theaters and see a movie. Despite not getting a text about my car yet, I walked back over to the center. Once I got there, my car was just finishing up her service! Oil change and a movie? Yes!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I would not recommend leaving your car for service at this dealership. My belongings got stolen, and the dealership does not want to take responsibility and replace all my stolen items because I have no receipts. Their manager did not bother to see their cameras and when I got my car back. They also left my car dirty, including the fingerprints from their mechanics all over the hood and trunk. It makes me think their mechanics are the people who stole everything from my car. I will no longer be bringing my car back to this Subaru dealership.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Not sure how friendly they actually are... I've called 60 minutes before they closed yesterday, and it kept going through a phone loop. I tried selecting "Operator", "Service Department", "Parts" NO ONE answered. I repeated the same this morning and after the forth loop through the "to connect to ..." message I finally got through. The conversation went like this: ME: "I see your site says it takes 3 days to do the recall fix. Is that true? Or do you have the parts in stock?" THEM: It only takes a day, but a full day, would you like to schedule an appointment?  ME: Yes, can I drop it off for "early bird" tomorrow?  THEM: No, you have to be present.  ME: Ok, then when is your earliest appointment tomorrow?  THEM: Would you like me to schedule an appointment? ME: Yes, when is your earliest appointment tomorrow?  THEM: We have today and tomorrow available. But you have to be present to get a loaner.  ME: Oh, a loaner, then I will take your first available appointment. When is that? THEM: We have both today and tomorrow. {CLICK}.

I get the distinct impression that either they try to be inept to NOT handle the recall, or that the person I spoke with simply doesn't understand English (though she certainly sounded like a native speaker). I was using a landline, and the conversation sounded very clear to me.

So fast forward a few days. I had similar problem connecting with another Dealership, so went online and simply made an 8:15 am appointment. The website wasn't so great... after answering a ton of questions (including that it was an airbag recall fix), it said "what service do you need?" Sigh.

I brought my Forester in the next morning a bit before 8 am. There was a huge crush of people and it took about an hour before they got to my car. Another 15 minutes or so later I was on my way out - my wife took me home. The agent (friendly and helpful - and angry about the lack of training for the person who handled the call) said service would be completed the next day at or before noon. At noon the next day I hadn't heard from my service agent, but since we were in the neighborhood just before noon we dropped by... then went to lunch and did some shopping when they said it would be an hour or so longer. It actually finished about 4:15 PM.

The new problem: about 2 hours outside of the Bay Area on our way down south, the right passenger window molding came loose. It doesn't appear that it is possible to put it back in place without some sort of additional repair.  Now we're back in town and I'm not relishing going through the phone tree fiasco again to get this thing repaired.

On the positive side, I did ask them to make two other repairs: replacing a bad tire pressure sensor, and refitting my driver door panel. The charges for those two fixes were very reasonable.  Due to my in person experience being mostly good, I've upped them to two stars. If I can get the last bit of the fix completed, I might even go 3 stars.... because the other Subaru dealer in San Jose is outright dishonest.  I'll take phone clumsy dealers over cheats any day!< /text>< Pics>

For the valve spring recall, they told me the earliest appointment will be on September(4 month later). When I ask why they immediately transfer to the “manager” and of course nobody answered the phone.
Fremont Subaru will do the job in next Monday when I called on Friday afternoon 4:30 Pm and they even apologized for no availability over the weekend.
When I call this place again to cancel the appointment for rear brake lamp switch, nobody answer the phone again.</Text>

Great experience with this dealer! Shane was the sales member who helped us out and we could not have been happier with the process/price/vehicle. Most dealers put you under a lot of pressure in hopes of maximizing their profits but this was not at all my experience at Stevens Creek Subaru. Shane clearly explained our options when it came to the prices/addons without pressuring us one way or another. This made us feel confident that we were going with the right dealer and making the choices we wanted to make. More than happy to endorse them.</Review>

Updating my review. I had a repair that went fast and smooth within one day and the car was returned to me the same day. It was really great and I don't have an issue anymore. Minus one star because scheduling an appointment takes too long. The service department doesn't pick up the phone and doesn't return the calls. Have to call them again a few times.< /Review>

< review>
I am a returning customer. Eight years ago, we bought our first Outback and today I am returning to the same dealership and made a successful deal with Mr. Shane Amirkiai.
Under such shelter in place condition, the dealership make all the efforts and had everything prepared ahead via email communications. Since I know exactly what I am looking for, we came into final price very smoothly. It just done within 3 days. My old car trade in and new car comes with me home.
I like this place, people are professional and nice. We know it is a hard time for everybody due to the COVID-19. But I am lucky enough to have a great shopping experience and get back a great car.
Thank you stevens creek subaru!</review>

<review>We worked with a great salesperson at this dealership and would personally like to refer people directly to him. Hi name is Denis and he was great. He was very open and honest with all our questions. We asked him about new cars, used cars, taxes, and ways to save money. He offered information about all this without any hesitation. He was very transparent in the process used to establish a final price. My wife and I felt like we were working with an informed professional. He was not a sleazy or pushy salesperson, he provided great customer service. We recently walked out of other dealerships because of the salespeople, I wasn't going to spend my money with them. At the end of all this we feel Denis did a great job and helped us to make the right choice for our family.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1548965907477, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to share with us, Christian!

First time car buyer, didn't know what to expect. I was helped by Isaac, and he did a great job walking me through the process. I was pretty nervous going in, but I soon felt comfortable with Isaac and I was glad he was helping me. By the end of it we were having good conversation about music making, it was pretty fun actually. I now have a beautiful blue subaru crosstrek, exactly the car i wanted, and if felt so good to drive it home. It was raining too but that didn't seem to make a difference in the driving.

<Date>1558660032802<//Date><text>I was researching for a outback two weeks back, quoting the price across the bay area. Most of the dealers here provide you a very low price upfront then they tell you that is the cash price. If you want to get the 0% APR Subaru is promoting, they will give you a different price, normally thousand dollar higher!
Steven Creek Subaru is the only one don't use this trick. They just gave me one price and it qualify the Subaru financing. It might not beat the cash price from some other dealer, but it gave me the best price with Subaru finance, it make my car shipping life easier.
I showed up on Saturday in the afternoon at 2:30pm, Shane worked with me to go through the whole test drive and purchase process. He is knowledgeable sales and provide me the suggestion for the accessory I care about.
The dealership pace is is not big, not easy to get a parking spot in the weekend, and people are line up meeting the finance manager. At the end I have my car driven out after 3 hours.< /text><resp>{'time': 1558719102168, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving this rating and review.

<review>I had an appointment for routine maintenance on a very busy Friday afternoon. I asked the service tech to include repair of a recall problem. He said he couldn't promise their staff would have time to take care of the recall item, but he'd do what he could. In fact, they WERE able to complete that additional service - which was great, because it meant I did not have to return for the work to be done!<//review>< pics>

Stevens Creek Subaru,

Roy has been outstanding at providing customer service, he made my first time buying experience at Subaru dealership a breeze. I have been to multiple ones in the area but Stevens creek was very accommodating. I was in and out of there pretty quick and haggle free. Thanks to him, I now own a Subaru. He had great energy and will help you answer questions even when he is off the clock. Great salesman, very accommodating, and super friendly. Ask for him if you stop by the Stevens creek area, also this guy always has a friendly smile and bunch of jokes to tell so be ready to have s fun buying experience. I will definitely be back in the future and hope he will be a manager by then because he deserves it.

Best Regards,

Benjamin Ha

PS. This gentleman is always upbeat, smiling, and loud, so you will not miss him.<//text>

Highlights: BE PREPARED deceitful "financial manager", poor documentation, lack of knowledge from "financial managers", confrontational, aggressive.

I would like to start by saying that anyone who wants to avoid a stereo typically sleazy car buying experience, does not feel comfortable with one-on-one negotiations, or has not completed thorough research should actively avoid Stevens Creek Subaru because of their "financial managers." I've been considering what I've wanted in my next car for some time now, so after months of research and discussion with friends, I found “my” car, the 2017 Subaru Forester Touring. And I mean it was MY car.. this car had everything I could ask for: rich brown leather interior, adaptive cruise control for the stop-and-go Bay Area traffic, all-wheel drive for those long weekends to Tahoe, and a jaw-dropping panoramic moon roof for stargazing in Yosemite. There it was, I found “my” car at Stevens Creek. It seemed like an easy process as the sale started: test drive, discuss specifications, and finally we talk price. I settled on a price the car as well as an extended warranty that was more than fair. And that's when the real Stevens Creek Subaru car buying experience began: with “financial manager” Luis. Once I agreed on a price for the vehicle,  I was asked how I would be financing. Early in the negotiations, I had asked if there was an incentive for a well-qualified buyer financing through the dealership.The answer was no.  Luis was flabbergasted that I had secured my own financing, but this didn’t deter the sale. I was prompted to fill out some information, but soon realized that this information was a credit application. Since I had my own financing, I was confused. I went to clarify and was immediately confronted by another “manager” exclaiming “YOU DO WANT THE 1.99% FINANCING DON’T YOU?!" Soon this manager realized I wasn’t financing with them and went into a sob story about how they weren’t previously paid for a vehicle off the lot. I agreed and they saw my 803 credit score and continued with the sale of the car. I should have left after this experience but again it was “my” vehicle, so how do I walk away? Luis led me to his office to begin signing papers, and began expanding on the warranty. I asked for clarifying details about what was covered. He couldn’t provide any specifics aside from a small pamphlet with buzzwords of *electronics*, *power steering*, and *air conditioning*. Since he wouldn’t provide a more detailed answer, I asked to discuss the price of the warranty further. Luis was getting uncomfortable, so I asked who dictated the price of the warranty and the deductible. Initially he stated that Subaru wouldn’t allow certain concessions, so I asked another question on the price, and he followed up with that pricing was specific to “city,region, and dealership.” And so Luis contradicted himself for the first time that night. I accepted this because it felt like minor details about the car I was dreaming of.As we continued with the car buying process, we reviewed the service history documented in Subaru’s log. This CERTIFIED PREOWNED CAR had two dead batteries in the span of two months. I asked further questions about what this could mean. In response, I was told that the batteries had been replaced with OEM parts and it was no longer an issue. I went to sign the Carfaxf or the process of the CPO vehicle only to realize that the only service history that was listed was from the most recent certification for the CPO.This really bothered me because it made no mention of the two visits for the drained batteries. At this point I said I would be more than happy to sign the Subaru service records that reflected the actual maintenance on the car but I would not be signing the Carfax because it didn’t truly paint the whole picture.I was told this could not happen and that I could leave from the deal if I wanted. After a four-hour ordeal,  I did decide to walk away because of the discrepancies in the documentation as well as the unethical tactics used by the “financial managers."</review>

<review>Update - Changing 5 -> 4 stars.
I was promised a travel reimbursement as part of the deal.
It didn't get added to the paperwork and a check was supposed to be sent over the next week. 4 weeks later no check. Follow-ups have been unsuccessful. Still a great experience overall, just a sub-par ending.

Shane is awesome.
People speak of going the extra mile. He went at least 5.
- Got the car rewashed/detailed to make it look perfect
- Answered all my questions quickly (even afterhours)
- Amazing deal. Honest and straightforward.
- Went above and beyond to get me the car as soon as possible
- He paired me with Janet from finance who was amazing too.

Janet
- Patiently explained every part of the lease, every form to sign, etc.
- Took my concerns and questions seriously, and asked when she didn't know the answer (instead of dismissing them)
- Was creative in coming up with solutions to move the process forward
- Made sure I didn't have any other questions at the end / understood all the numbers.</review>< pics>

Terrible value for the money. They performed 2 hours of service and charged me $490 for labor (not to mention the other $390 they charged me for solvents, fluids, and filters). Total rip off, you’re better off finding a Jiffy Lube if all you need is a servicing< /Review>

<review>The service was good. But I was not told the Outback I want did not come with a button to close and open the trunk. So, every time I have to open and close the trunk with my hands manually and forcefully and that causes my shoulder and arm in pain. Wonder if I can change the car with trunk open/close button?< /review>< Date>

<Review>The only reason I'm giving this place 5 starts is because of Aydin. He was the most hardworking, no BS, car salesman that I ever worked with in my life.

I will say I was disappointed that having just bought a $30k car from them, they gave me a bent key and wouldn’t fix it even though I pointed it out before I even left the building. It was “bent, but still within their standards”.

Also, I’d think twice about having them work on your car. If they don’t seem to know basic things like not over torquing an oil pan plug, I wonder what else their service technicians may be doing wrong. There’s no reason you should have to use an impact to get an oil plug out.

Finally, I get that the sales guy has to send marketing emails to me from time to time, but they’ve got to be the laziest marketing emails ever, riddled with spelling mistakes and poor punctuation.</Text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I've been to the Service Department at Stevens Creek a few times and had no issues. Service was good.

I was recently in the market for a Crosstrek. Found one at Stevens Creek so I sent an inquiry through their website. I promptly received a message back from Shane and he setup a time for us to come see the car. When we arrived the car had already been prepped and ready for us to test drive. Shane was great. He obviously had a passion for Subaru and was extremely knowledgable about them. We chatted about our shared interest in cars during the test drive. Shane was honest about the car and the buying process. The Crosstrek was in great condition and the price was fair so we made the easy decision to buy. I highly recommend Shane for making our purchase so easy and even a little bit enjoyable!<//Review>

<Text>I wouldn't even bother giving them a star. I own a 2019 Subaru WRX Limited (Manual/Stick Shift). I am very passionate about cars and love my car. Please take my review seriously - the people reading as well as the owner of this place.

1. No punctuality - they say they will give the car in a day or two, but it extends for more than 4 days.
2. They wouldn't give me a loaner car even when my car is there with them for service for more than 4 days.
3. Service advisors have limited knowledge.
4. They don't handle the cars well - they have scratched 3 rims of my car.
5. They don't call back to give updates - I had to call them literally 5-6 times to get hold of the service advisor.
6. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THEY DON'T EVEN FIX THE ISSUE STATED.

This service center is horrible! Subaru USA has to take necessary action.<//Text><date>1562877649488< /date>< userid>

Not quite sure where to begin. I don’t leave reviews nor do I do surveys, but I am beyond frustrated with the service dept. at this dealership. My cars been in and out since AUGUST 2019 for the same issue. November 25th I took the car in and the dealership kept the car all the way till December 27th. 3 days later I had to bring it back again for the same problem. My car is not the same and it will never be. I loved Subaru and planned on being a customer for a long time. I am paying this car off and getting rid of it. I already turned over our first Subaru Forester for a Mazda CX-5. Note to service managers... LISTEN TO THE CUSTOMERS!!!<//Text>

I had my Outback for 30,000 miles maintenance today. When I dropped off the car, I check the items of this services, and ask three times is differential fluid replacement recommended by Subaru? They answered yes. When I checked manual later today, differential fluid doesn't even need to be inspect @30,000 miles :(.
When I came back to pick up the car, the guy told me it's their recommendation not from Subaru :(.</text>

<text>Brought my 2017 Forester (still within warranty) in with warring lights all came on. Not only the dealer didn't know the reason why and went ahead and replace the battery, my window was not rolling down and left a ding on passenger door and side mirror hub  which require q week to  repair. After week having it back, just realize my seat memory doesn't work ( will not memorize my seating position). Need to take more time off work to bring the car in for service that was not complete.</text>< pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I worked with Roy, and the process was straightforward.  While the exact configuration of the vehicle I wanted was not available (which is the case nationwide - its just a very rare configuration), once I came to a decision on an available vehicle, Roy matched the offer I had and there were no surprises.  Other dealers in the area could not match the the same price.  Buying a car is overall not a fun process, but doing my homework ahead of time, and then working with Roy at Stevens Creek, made the sales part of it not at all bad.  I'd purchase at Stevens Creek Subaru again.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

This is for the service department of Subaru. I was running late by 10 minutes, called the dealership and I was rudely told by the lady that I would be considered a walk-in and the wait time is between 2-3 hours for walk-ins. Disappointed,  I reschedule for 2 weeks out, I went went back home, pulled their website and found an 4 available slots for the same day. I called back and the lady was “puzzled” and did confirm another appointment for the same day. My question is - why blatantly lie and break customer trust?!? #shameful< /text>

"If you have nothing good to say, better to say nothing" or something like that.
I waited too long (supposedly my fault), other than that, it was OK.

Sorry it took so long to answer - I was in Philadelphia. Which reminds me my Legacy will  be for sale. Are you interested? It has only about 14 K miles- great condition.

He let me take my time, mull over my options, and was direct, straightforward, and friendly. He walked me through everything—multiple car options and trim levels, each with pricing info—and communicated throughout the month. It meant enough to me that I chose to buy at Stevens Creek over other dealers who could match the same price, because I felt like there was a different level of customer service. I actually learned a lot through the process! And, I thought it was neat to chat with different people who work there—everyone was so welcoming. This is clearly a great team.< /review>< pics>

Upon taking it in for a diagnostic check-up a month back (in the last week of April), I was told that the head unit would have to be replaced and a new head unit order had been placed for me (which would take ~1 week to arrive). It's been almost 6 weeks now and I haven't heard back on the status yet. To save time, I decided to drop in at the dealership a few days back and was told that the service department would follow-up soon.
While the service team have been courteous during my past interactions, the lack of proactive follow-up from them is disappointing. I'm still waiting for that call while driving around without media/ navigation/ a back up display aid for the last 6 weeks.<//Review>< response>

<Review>I've heard horror stories of women getting ignored and ripped off at car dealerships, but I had the opposite experience here at Stevens Creek Subaru. Essi, my sales consultant, was patient and worked with me to find the right car. Unlike other sales consultants, he didn't pressure me, was honest with pricing and and gave me a great deal! Essi's also good at following up post-purchase, which I think shows how much he cares about his customers. Would recommend!

p.s. Though I recommend Essi, I did not have a great experience with their business manager, who handles the final paperwork. So not sure if EVERYBODY at Stevens Creek is nice.< /Review>< pics>

Their website says their express service (e.g. oil change) is open until 6:30pm.  I showed up 5:00pm and was told their techs are gone and they stop taking walk-ins at 3:30.  Completely different than how it is advertised online.  I'll find a different Subaru shop for all my future maintenance and repairs.</text>

<Review>I was greeted promptly and courteously. Service order was quickly written up and I was told how long it would take. I was informed that the air filter was dirty and asked if I want to change it now (it would have been due to be changed on the next visit. And I was informed of the cost). I decided to have them change it at this appointment. Everything was completed within the time I was told. And all details of what was done was explained and also how much longer I have on tires, brakes, etc. I remain very impressed with your service department.<//Review>< pictures>

Shane did a great job starting from the internet inquiry, to following up through the process of negotiation. Shane really made this process very smooth and easy when buying my first Subaru. Overall it was a great experience and I really recommend Stevens Creek Subaru. Also Shane helped me through the process of getting the accessories! Thanks Shane!<//review>

<Text>First bought a car in December, had a very subpar experience due to the finance manager constantly changing numbers on us after we agreed on a set price.

Brought the car in for a service with an appointment, got the car back in a reasonable time for the services performed.

Three stars only because of the manager trying to dupe us for a price higher than what was agreed on.<//Text></record>

The service was good for just standard maintenance on the car, but my main issue was getting a confirmed answer regarding a cracked windshield. I was told to contact the 3rd party vendor, but when I called them, they told me that Subaru was supposed to call them directly. When I relayed that message, Subaru said no, I need to set up and appointment. It's extremely frustrating when neither party could make up their mind. Cracked windshields are dangerous and I PAID for warranty! Now I don't even know what to do when neither party will take responsibility.</Text>

Worst customer service ever. The service personal have least respect for customers and their time. They neither speak kind nor considerate about the customers needs and time. Unit manager kindly take these reviews seriously and take actions after all the sole purpose of your dealership is to sell/service cars for your clients and customers right???</review>

Bought two cars from this dealership, highly recommend Shane as a sales rep., he made the whole experience seamless (I only needed to turn up in person to the dealership to sign the paperwork and pick up the car). Fair and competitive pricing, so you don't have to waste more time haggling over details.</Review>

<username>Marco Calderon< /username><Date>1518922841749<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Very poor experience.  We're at the stage in our car search where we're actively looking to test drive vehicles and assess how they handle.  We show up and arrange a test drive, and in doing so the salesperson (Julio) asks us if we know anything about the vehicle we've asked to test drive.  I name off what I know, but the salesperson doesn't offer any further information or really try to pitch the car to me at all.  He just lets me know that it's "been redone for 2018."  Ok, fine.

We go out to test drive the car itself, and aside from giving us basic directions about where to turn, he says absolutely nothing.  No pitch, no questions, no semblance of actually wanting to sell this car to us... nothing.  We return to the lot and he immediately ask if we want to work out a deal right there, to which we tell him that we need to do a bit more research on the other cars in our list before we can make that decision.  At that point, he gives us a half smile and says, verbatim, "you're lucky you caught me - I don't do test drives, I sell cars."  At that point, my girlfriend and I were done.  I don't really care what sort of deal they want to offer us, I'm not spending my money at a place that treats potential customers so poorly.  Stay away, and spend your money with a group of people that treat you like they want your business.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I would not recommend Stevens Creek Subaru to anyone I know. We are coming up at the end of our lease and I called last Sunday (10/9) to see if they would help us to buy out our vehicle. The rep told me that would be no problem and to stop in anywhere after 6PM. Upon arrival the salesman told us that in order to buy out the lease we needed to do a safety check and that their service department was closed for the day. We scheduled the safety check for Tuesday (10/9). After making the trip back to the dealership they completed the safety check (which passed). The customer service rep told us that they would not be able to help us buy the vehicle without an additional smog check and that it would take over a week for him to get our options together from their finance department. Being that this dealership is able to sell a new/used vehicle on the same day I know for a fact that they could help us to buy out our leased vehicle. All we needed was a straight forward answer that they weren't willing to help us so we could have saved out time and frustration. I find their tactics and customer service misleading and shifty. If you value your time, wallet and sanity do no use Stevens Creek Subaru.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>Very unpleasant experience in here! I am very eager to buy a Subaru here(since it's nearest Subaru dealer from my house). After driving test and everything satisfied, I start to negotiate price with salesperson.

A Korean manager came by, Attention!!! He is so rude! He is very aggressive, and always keep saying "You Chinese" makes me feel very uncomfortable, I think he's kind of racists. Then when I say other dealer provide me better price, can you beat that, he started to yell at me, he said You are not honest customer, you shopping around! Of course I need to shopping around for the price, I am not stupid, when you are buying clothe you will look around for a while, how about a car more than $30,000! I think he's trying play tricks with customers! In the whole process, he's warning and yelling me, I feel scared!

Very very unpleasant! Hopefully management in here can solve this kind of situation, otherwise I will tell all the people I know stay away from this site! This is the first time I give review on google, I am really very angry and uncomfortable for this place!< /Review>< pictures>

<text>I purchased WRX STI 2020 at Stevens creek subaru. The Sales manager RJ, Taz and Dennis were really helpful . This was my first car and being new to credit history i was skeptical that i might not be approved for a loan, they worked the whole day on my application with the bank to get it approved. I will be thankful to them and would definitely recommend this dealership. The hospitality was very great, Ali the manager over there offered us great herbal chamomile tea which helped me with the cough that day. I liked the same day delivery of the vehicle and the paper work was done very fast with clear and detail description of what all i am signing on.</text>< UserId.>

<Text>I’m sorry to say that it was a disappointment visiting Stevens Creek Subaru. Very unhappy and offended to hear impolite remarks from your team(Aydin Fattahe), when I visited the showroom.
First of all, he wasn’t present at the time of appointment and Shane spoke to me instead of him.
And After I had test driven an Outback, I requested to test drive a Forester, that was when Aydin told me over the phone, in a harsh tone, “I can’t do that, it is sales time, and I’m kinda busy. You need to do a little research before coming in.”. I’m in my 6th week of car shopping and was present at the store to finalize one of them (Outback or Forester), only after test driving them.
It was a disappointment visiting Steven’s Creek Subaru and to talk to such an abrasive salesperson. Those remarks were unacceptable.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Head gaskets, wheel bearings, crank shaft sensors. These cars are Japanese - they are NOT Toyotas. They break.

The least you could do is give me the already inflated retail price.< /review>< Rate>

They do NOT honor other Subaru dealership warranties. ..isn’t that the whole point of having a brand name dealership - unified support for the brand product ie Subaru. Imagine if all Apple stores were “independently owned” and you could only bring your Apple product to the exact same store where it was purchased.

Also, quoted $900 to diagnose (not fix, just diagnose) 3 issues.

<review>It makes me quite sad to write this review, as I'd previously had some good experiences at Steven's Creek Subaru (hence 2 stars instead of 1), but this latest experience was so bad that I feel the need to do this.

Last week, I brought my Outback in for an oil change and to get some leaky hoses in the windshield fluid system fixed. They did the oil change, but charged me quite a lot to simply tell me what I'd already told them about the hoses (that they were leaking) and nothing more. That alone would have been bad, but upon leaving I discovered that there was now a rattling/wobbling noise coming from my car that had not been there before. This concerns me as a potential safety issue, and I have been very hesitant to drive since.

That alone would be bad, but it would be forgivable if Steven's Creek Subaru could fix the issue that they caused. 20+ phone calls and an email to the manager later, and I have still be unable to get in contact with anyone. That includes messages left with two different operators who told me that nobody from the services department was available, but that one would call me back as soon as they were. I guess that department has been running 24/7 without even a minute to spare, because I have never received a single call.

This level of negligence is extremely disrespectful to customers. Combining that with high prices for substandard work leaves me feeling taken advantage of and ignored. Once a long-time customer, I will not be returning.

EDIT: Please do not mistake the responses to reviews like mine by Steven's Creek Subaru for genuine interest in the issues expressed by its customers. It's abundantly clear that this organization's propensity for ignoring phone calls and refusing to return messages extends right to the very top.</review>< user_id>

I was very happy with this dealership. We booked a time with Shane and he did a great job to tell us about all the features of the car. Shane is very knowledgeable and also very friendly. He took his time to explain everything in detail. Cemal also took care of financing part and he was also a very pleasant fellow to work with. Overall everything went very smooth.<//review>

I had a great experience working with Shane Amirkiai - I already knew I wanted the 2019 Subaru Forester and Shane was very prompt to respond at all times in helping us set up the new lease. He was very quick on getting all the paperwork together as well and when the time came for me to pick up the car, he was very knowledgable and concise when he walked me through all the features. Work with Shane if you can, he was great.<//text>

<user_name>Brandon Horng</user_name><review>Best dealership ever, I been shopping around bay area dealerships for a ascent. I messaged shane amirkiai and told him the best offer I got so far. He messaged me back and said he would be able to beat that price. The color I wanted with options I wanted was not in stock but they had one on the way from the factory and they would hold it for me. Shane constantly gave me updates about what's going along with being very quick to respond to my messages and questions. If your in need for a subaru I would highly recommend shane, dealing with shane was the best car buying experience I have had.</review></record></dataset><record>

I will say that the past few times I've taken it in for routine (oil change, tire rotation, etc.) They have taken a long time to get my car serviced. Six hours the last time I brought it in, in May 2017. They were nice enough to give me a 20% discount on the total cost and even offered to repair a part that is no longer under warranty. Overall, I've had somewhat positive experiences at this dealership and they do have a great inventory of Subaru's.<//review>< username>

But, taking the car in was always an errand that was a  hassle for me and the way it made it not so bad was the simple thing of rewarding myself with a morning doughnut that was placed in the waiting room!  It made it not so bad when I had the doughnut and coffee there.  However... last couple times- no doughnuts for the customers.  I saw a couple of employees eating them at the register.  So, it goes.

< review>
I brought my vehicle in for service on July 12 with a request to look into a chirping sound when the clutch was disengaged. I was contacted by Edwin, my service rep, that evening and told that the noise was being caused by a bad throwout bearing that he had confirmed with his manager was under warranty. However, there were vehicles ahead of mine and it would take 2-3 weeks to begin the repair and that I would be contacted then to get a replacement vehicle. I left the vehicle at the shop pending the repair.

I contacted Edwin again on July 25 to inquire as to whether the repair had been started. I expressed concern that I had plans coming up the weekend of the 30th. I was told that the shop was not ready to begin the repair and that I should pick up my vehicle. I would be contacted the following week to get a replacement vehicle and start the repair, which should be about two weeks.

A week and a half later I called again to find out where things were at. The service rep that answered my call informed me he would look into the matter and get back to me. I never received a call back and my follow-up call went to voicemail. It is then that I submitted the 2 star rating since I was feeling like I was being ignored and had been waiting 4 weeks for a repair I was told would take 2-3 weeks.

Ron left a message expressing concern at my rating and I called back again a week later and found out that the service representative that I had been working with was no longer with the shop. I asked to speak to Ron, who was not available, and was told he would call me back. I never received a call back from Ron.

I happened to be near the shop for a family event on August 22 and I stopped in and followed up in person. After looking into the issue for a bit, I was brought into the service manager's office to speak to Gary. I was told that there was a back up in the heavy lane and that they would be able to start work in 2 weeks.

I called back again the morning of September 7 to find out if I could bring my vehicle in since the two weeks had past without incident. I was asked to work with Caesar as my service representative, who informed me he would look into whether the parts and a replacement vehicle were ready and that they would call me back. Again, I received no call back.

After following up several times without response, I reached Jonathan on Caesar's day off the week of September 24. He did call me back and informed me that the car was in queue but would be another two weeks due to the backup.

I was again in the area and followed up in person on October 7. During my visit I discovered that Caesar was no longer working with the dealership and was told that they would leave a message with Gary to get back to me on Tuesday. I received a call on Wednesday informing me that Charles would be taking over as my service rep. He had spoken with Gary, confirmed that the repair was under warranty and was putting my car in queue for repair. I was told I should expect a call back when my car comes up for repair but that there is a backup in the heavy lane.

It's been three months that I have been waiting for a repair that I have now been told on 5 occasions would take 2 weeks. After having bought two cars from this dealership I am seriously questioning why I would ever buy here again because the service department is a joke.< /review>

Awful, awful experience.  Called to get 4 tires replaced.  Getting a hold of services and parts department just to obtain a quote was a multiple day, multiple transfer affair.  Put up with it since this place is so close to my house.  They said they had my tires in inventory and I made an appointment. key point, be sure to ask for itemized quote as they try to sneak things in.  After dropping off car and dealing with sneaky estimates at 9am, I receive a phone call mid day 12pm telling me they couldn't change my tires.  They only had 3 tires instead of 4 in inventory is.  This is after parts department had confirmed to me on the phone they had tires in inventory and hence only reason why I scheduled service appt.  To make sure they got money from me, after I said I would buy tires somewhere else, of course, they had a lengthy list of costly "recommended services" after "inspecting" my car.  Never go to this dealership, overpriced.  Changing wind shield wipers was quoted at $99 before tax, got news ones for $20 andclipped em on myself in 3 minutes.  Stay away, horrible customer experience, just try to find good mechanic or better dealership service center.< /text>

Perfect until the moment you pay them, ever since having anything done with them is a nightmare and even thinking about needing to reach out to them gives me anxiety. Employees (service and receptionist sitting in sweatpants) either don’t have a clue either give you wrong information.

For real, until you pay, everything is perfect. Then it’s just a nightmare, had a car for a year and dealing with them is painful, give your money elsewhere.</Text>

Terrible follow up.  I brought my 2017 outback for oil change and recall software update and then they broke the steering column plastic cover.  They said they'd order the part and give me a call within 3-4 days.  Never got the call even after two weeks.  So I gave them calls for two days straight to the service advisor who handled the recall.  He never called me back so I called the parts dept.  They said they never ordered the part.  On the third day I finally got a call from the advisor to bring in the car the next week.  After all I did get the part replaced but their inability to respond even to a phone call was appaling.

I'm writing this to the response to the initial reply from the dealer.
It states that I should give them a call to discuss the details.  Well, that's the problem isn't it.  You  have my number and you are asking for the details.  Shouldn't you be the one to call me instead?
I really enjoyed working with Sean, my sales person when I purchased the Outback two years ago.  But I sure don't know about the service deptartment.<//text>

So thoughtful of the team to do this, even though I wouldn’t have complained if they asked me to return at the scheduled date. This is what I would call as stretching the extra mile for customer satisfaction.

<Review>I scheduled an appointment for my 2017 Forester since the roof seemed to be leaking. The closest dealership is 20 miles from where I live, so I requested a loaner car while the warranty work was being performed. Nobody could tell me if they would have a loaner available for me, so I had to make other arrangements on my dime. The work was performed in a timely fashion, but when I picked up my car, it was dirtier than when I dropped it off and there were hard water spots all over the exterior of the car which I had removed on my dime. I thought that Stevens Creek Subaru would take better care of someone who purchased the car from them. At least it seems they fixed the leak.< /Review>< pictures>

<username>Kate Karimi<//username><Resp>None< /Resp><Review>I strongly recommend this dealer,  “Stevens Creek Subaru” and  I recommend you work with “Frank H.” from the “Internet Sales Department” for a fabulous experience. I especially liked the experience because I was able to contact him via submitting an online request (online internet sales team) and Frank H. took perfect note of what we were looking for and took excellent care of me and my family. He had what we were looking for before we stepped foot in the dealership.

Frank H. worked with us to find what car could fit with our needs and financial possibilities. After about a few hours of searching, He finally got the right car for us with the price meeting our request. Frank H. gave us a call back and scheduled an appointment to discuss the different options we have according to our budget.

I thank Frank H. for his friendliness, patience and honesty. I think his attitude and honesty motivated my family and I so much that we bought the car with no worries in mind and “We do love the car”.

I will definitely be recommending my friends and family to this dealership and particularly to Frank H. I also recommend anyone reading my review here to do so as well! Easiest way to ensure you get the best experience, call the dealership and ASK FOR FRANK H. @ INTERNET SALES DEPARTMENT! I know you too will appreciate the experience that Frank H. provided to us!<//Review>< Pics>

I first can in mid January looking for a DGM ‘19 crosstrek with black interior. I couldn’t find a single one within a hundred miles! Ben was my sales advisor and was incredibly helpful getting the exact car I wanted ordered, and for great price! He was very prompt too, always updating me on the order status (it was delayed due to a recall). My wait is over and I’m loving my new ride! I will definitely recommend his services!< /Text>

Guys are friendly. Asked if I could test drive a brz. They said they would get one over in an hour. Came back in 1:15, no car, but left, both one new about it. Honestly it's probably because I am 27 and they did not think I would buy one. There loss, honestly close to buying one. They had the right color.</text>

German who was my service advisor was awesome and provided regular updates for my vehicle. Inversely, when he was not available the staff members who were helping me did not provide the same service. It was extremely frustrating to be told I was going to get a callback or get a status update within 15 to 20 minutes and be waiting hours and still not receive a call or at least an email. This happened to me twice and after expressing to the receptionist how frustrated I was I received a call back from the service advisor Ernesto who had helped me in German absence. It seemed apparent that Ernesto wasn’t aware that I had been requesting an update until I expressed my frustration with the receptionist. So that I can give a time frame I dropped off my car shortly after 7 am and  didn’t receive any status update so I started calling at one. When I finally got a callback from a Ernesto at 430-ish I was told that they discovered they ordered the wrong parts and the funny thing is they found out around one.< /text>

Just went in for a minor repair among a few other things and now I wish I hadn't asked for the repair at all. They gave me a high quotation for the repair and the service rep said, "don't worry, it won't cost anywhere near this amount." Sure enough, it came back at almost exactly the quoted price, 75% in labor. Lesson learned for me...

If you need to get service done, stay away from this place. It'll be my last time going to them for anything else.</Text>

This is the car purchasing that I spent least time doing negotiation with; it took only about 1.5 hours totally for me to do the test drive, go over the details of the car, sign all papers and finally drive it out of the door of Stevens Creek Subaru.</text>< gmap_id>

Very satisfied with this dealership and Shane who helped me! Submit a request online and Shane responded to my request soon. He gave me a pretty good number for me lease before I even walked in by email, unlike other dealers usually just try to bring you in( it is not easy to arrange time) .The entire process is swift and smooth, Shane is very knowledgable and pleasant to talk to. He helped me along the process and gave me very good deal on the car.
All staff I work with in Stevens Creek Subaru are very helpful. Shane helped me test drove, guide me through the process, gave very detailed introduction and walk through to the car; The managers are very easy to work with too, I got a lot of stupid questions, but got all of them answered patiently and really in detail.
Thanks a lot!<//text>

<Text>We had a really great experience today. Went in earlier this week to check out an STI after test driving other vehicles. We were assisted by Kyle and we scheduled a time to come in on Saturday to test drive. Kyle did advise that they were a bit short handed but the team worked like a well oiled machine to assist us through the busy day. He quickly ran the credit app and got us the okay to test drive the 2019 STI I was interested in.

I had gone online and received some online price quotes from different dealerships including Stevens Creek. Kyle immediately let us know that the price quote I received was from another sales rep, Shane. Without hesitation he swiftly transitioned us over to Masud who assisted me with getting my trade in appraised. They gave me a very fair appraisal that I was satisfied with and had shared the numbers with us while we waited for Shane to finish his other sale. The teamwork these guys had made this process seamless. We finally got to meet Search n and he assisted us with another test drive and officially talking numbers.

We finally decided we wanted to move forward with the trade in and he assisted us with the next steps. We were then introduced to their finance manager, William, who is also very knowledgeable and pleasant to work with. He made the signing process painless which topped my good feeling of satisfaction with their overall service.

I ended up trading my car and driving home with a brand new 2019 STI that me and my family absolutely love! I definitely felt in good hands with this entire staff. They are honest and willing to work with you.

I would like to thank Shane and the rest of the staff for such a painless and overall satisfying experience!<//Text>< Pics>

< Review>
We purchased our car here and have had it serviced here since then, but we've been repeatedly underwhelmed with the experience.

When we first bought our Subaru, we were talked into pre-paying for service for the first few years. The way the contract was written, that deal expired after a certain number of service appointments or a number of years. I pointed out that since we expected our car to be a low-mileage vehicle, it would probably be a long time between services, so pre-paying didn't make sense. The seller said he understood and altered the contract such that there was no expiration date -- it was simply based on a number of pre-paid service visits.

Fast-forward a few years later and I found it impossible to redeem our pre-paid service visits. They explained that "our policy has changed" and they needed to respect the expiration. I explained that I had our contract specifically altered to prevent that. Long story short, I double-paid for years of service.

It only got worse when we had to bring in our vehicle for a recall. We made an appointment and brought the car in on the weekend only to have it explained to us that we'd need to leave the vehicle with them for TWO MONTHS. Most of that time, it would just be sitting there in a queue. As an alternative, we could keep our own car while we waited in the queue and they'd call us in a few weeks when they had time to service our vehicle.

When I asked why I needed to waste my weekend bringing in the car when we could have handled the exchange over the phone, they explained, "It's our policy." Apparently, it's their policy to waste their customers' time.

When we finally did get through the queue, we were told the service would take "a week and a half to two weeks." After three weeks I called for an update, but since I could only get updates from my designated service advisor, who works on an odd schedule, I had trouble finding out anything. In the end, it took a month to get the recall completed, not including the month and a half of waiting time.

To their credit, they provided a loaner vehicle while mine was serviced. At the first appointment, I explained that I'd need to travel with my dog and they said "of course" that was no problem. But when I actually picked up the loaner vehicle, they said "no dogs allowed." It's hard to say why as the loaner vehicle was filthy, complete with sticky soda spills and a center console filled the personal possessions of the previous driver.< /Review>

<text>My boyfriend and I purchased an Outback from Matt Kanawyer in the internet department this weekend. Matt was extremely patient, friendly, and never pushy with us. We didn't feel pressured during the entire process. Matt took his time to explain the features of the vehicle and answer my million plus one questions. I compared our purchase price to offers from other dealerships, and was extremely happy.

Matt even stayed past the time he was supposed to be off the next day for us to pick up the vehicle, since we couldn't get there till 7PM. Highly recommend working with him if you are in the market for a new car!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1553104546590, 'text': "Thanks for the positive feedback and recommendation!

Had a really bad experience last time when they did an oil change job on my Subaru. They were supposed to change the fluid and the filter but I found out later that they kept the old filter untouched! Really poor service. This was such a simple job. Don't know how much they would mess up if they perform a more complex and expensive job. Really can't trust them. If you want a good and reliable service done to your Subaru don't go there!<//Text>

I just recently called Steven's creek Subaru to schedule a replacement for a dangerous, recalled, passenger side airbag.  Despite the fact that my recall notice from Subaru and the service advisor I talked to said that the actual fix would take about 2.5 hours, they refused to find me a time during which the repair could be conducted in under 2.5 days.

They reflected it back to me as an unreasonable request.  Why would I expect that my car should come ahead of all the other recalls?  I tried to explain that I am willing to wait (I mentioned months, indefinite even) until they have an appointment available to service my car.  I expressed my dissatisfaction with these options and was hung up on.

I don't want to rent a vehicle for 3 days as a replacement.  I want to take my car in to fix something that should never have been a problem and to get it done in a timely manner without any hassle.  At this, Steven's Creek Subaru has failed me.

I assume (at best) that this insane, extraneous, expense is being passed on to buyers, and would steer clear.< /text>

Totally a great experience while getting my first Subaru car! And the car is amazing, I totally would recommend this dealer and his Staff!< /text>< pics>

< review>
Our sales guy Chris was Very Proactive and knowledgeable to provide all facts. He worked very well with Finance knowing about our budget concerns of Monthly Installment and making us happy and satisfied at end. We had planned to look at Crosstek while exploring options of SUV and drove off with Outback 2017. In general when you are exploring options, sales people are acting to make you feel like in rush/ forcing you but we didn't have this feeling with Chris. It was a completely thoughtful and happy decision with help of Chris.< /review>

Just bought an Subaru Outback from this place. They offered best price in Bay area. Very professional staff. Matt Kanawyre (their sales rep) was very helpful and proactive during whole purchase process. Their finance department found the best loan deal for me. Overall a great car buying experience.<//review>

Max is the salesperson you'd want, no rush and absolutely great salesman ever, he knows his stuff and tries hard to find answers for you if he doesn't know it already.

<Review>Red flags all around!  Stay as far away from this dealership as you possibly can.

I brought the car for warranty service to replace low beam headlight bulbs, waited 3 hours and picked up my vehicle.  Same night, I realized that the lights are still not working.  I took the car to Four B Auto Repair to see if I need wiring replaced.  But the guy told me my light bulbs are totally burnt out and doesn't seem to be replaced by the dealer.  Four B changed both of my low beem headlight bulbs for $40 with no labor cost and now my nights are working.  I went back to Subaru to get my money reimbursed and the service director (Sean or Shawn) heckled and cursed me out and asked me to leave the property.  Such treatment of customer in reasonable circumstance is unheard of.   No apology, nothing...

I wish I had recorded my interaction with this Sean guy.  Maybe I would've made some money on YouTube.  It was that bad.  😆

I'll be reaching out to Subaru corporate to see if they care to make things right.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>I made an appointment to look at a car with the salesperson. I was 30 minutes early so I  text the salesperson to let me know when he's ready. I just browsed around. No problem. No one greeted me or offered help. No problem. Ten minutes later, salesperson greeted me and brought me the car that I want. Test drove the car. I asked some questions regarding the car, which the salesperson had little bit more than zero knowledge about it. That's fine. After test drive, they sat me down and wanting to persuade me to buy. Unwilling to negotiate. I contacted you guys ahead of time and at least do the courtesy to do some homework. I hate when the dealership tries to suck money out of you instead of trying to do business to make both sides happy. The reason why i went to you because you are the closest. The service is poor. The deals are not particularly good. Other dealership offers me relatively better deals for the particular trim and unfortunately they do not have the trim I want with the options I desire. You guys just lost a customer and I do not recommend any of my friends or family to go there.<//Review><Rating>2<//Rating>< user_name>

I really appreciated his patience with us as we were one of the last customers of the day. He stayed with us 2.5 hours after closing time to talk with us and give us options to insecure that everyone was happy. I could tell he was determined to close the sale but it was nice that he kept it very professional and we did not feel rushed at all. Thanks you so much! I am in love with my new 2015 5-door Impreza, in the beautiful dark metallic gray color!!! Absolutely no regrets with my first experience at this dealership! Also, not the forget, the sales floor guy that greeted us upon arriving! I believe his name is John... He is awesome, very helpful, great product knowledge. He got us exactly what we were looking for, in the first try. Offered us a test drive. We drove it. Loved it. Bought it! Thank you!< /text>< pictures>

I will NEVER buy another car from here again and strongly advise you not to either. Mike Pepper was my sales rep and literally every element of this process, from ordering the vehicle to picking it up was completely botched. Without going into details, it was one of the worst, unprofessional customer experiences I have ever had. They have absolutely zero respect for their customers, no desire to provide honest and fair service, and no commitment to following through on anything they say.

UPDATE: Brian reached out to provide a contact number based on my review. I called this number on 2/20, left a voicemail with my contact information, and as of 2/25 I am still waiting for a call back. I will update this review IF he ever actually intends to have a conversation with me.<//review>

Been here multiple times to get my car serviced. There has been multiple times where I had a 7AM appointment (waited at the dealership) and then don't get an update until lunch or sometimes even the end of the day. There has also been times where I've come to get my check engine light fixed, they say its fixed, then comes back on immediately as I drive out where I have to waste another half/full day getting it looked at again. Hands down the most understaffed and worst dealership i've had to work with. Reading more reviews below, the manager seems to thing all these reviews are "isolated" incidents. I can assure you this is not the case.< /review>

Buying my first car here may have spoiled me for the rest of my car purchasing experiences. The sales people aren't pushy and the legal people help explain the multitude of paperwork you have to sign.

Bringing my car in for services is easy and simple. The online scheduling system work nicely. Their shuttle service needs a bit of work, maybe have more than one shuttle, but they are still great and will drive you where you need to go.<//Review>

Service advisor was friendly and wanted to make my experience a great one from the moment we shook hands. Appointment was done earlier than I thought; exceeding expectations. Beware of huge price delta for their “tiers” of major service. For 30k it was a range of $280-700. I assume if it had to be done there wouldn’t be an option to pay more for it.</Text>

understaffed mechanics with poorly trained service rep. took 3 hours longer than stated on drop off to do basic 6k mile service. Despite my receiving website information from Subaru the service rep. claimed they could not upgrade my navigation map and  that I would have to do  the download online to the cars microchip - this would require my purchasing a microchip reader. Very annoying and frustrating experience which devalues the Subaru "love" campaign.</text>

< Review>
Went there for first car service as it was 6 months since I bought the car. But I had not driven 6k miles. The service person was very helpful, filled the coolant and water. Recommended to get service done by mileage than actually time period. They were quick and efficient. I will edit this review post my first service when I get it done.<//Review>

Space is a little tight with construction going on but it is not bad.  On weekends they do not have shuttle service for the service center, limited space if you want to wait for the service.  They have WiFi and coffee.  Staff was ok, not engaging at drop off and pick up for me.< /review>

< Review>
The price was fair the sales staff was very friendly and help-full and the financing was good. I purchased a 3 year  42,000  mile service contract from the finance department  on 02/03/2015.  It normally takes two weeks to post so that you can use any Subaru dealership for service I took my car in for service today 06/30/2015 at Putnam and they had no record of the service agreement  so what is with this? Some one didn't do there job. I am not happy!!<//Review>

I am not coming back to this place again.  Zero star if I can. The "Express Service"  advertised  (coupon mailed to me) is not express at all.  The first time I stop by, they said 2 hours wait,  too long wait for me.  The second time I visit, the response is "our technician is busy for the rest of the day...cannot take more cars".  They don't even let me make appointment for oil change therefore must go there drop in and wait.   Finally, get it done for just over 1 hour wait.  This is already "fast" because I am the first few cars in the morning when open. To make my visit very unpleasant is this:  I checked in the car and presented with a coupon price $49.95,  (they took my car and coupon when check in) but when my car is ready, they tell me the price is $87.85 because the coupon is expired by one day!  I would still do it at regular price, but I think they should tell customer up front before service,  not after the fact the service is done and  "Here is your bill" !</review>

<user>101207508766833542939</user>< review>
I entered my car in for routine service. Part of the plastic surrounding near the windshield wipers flipped up over my windshield while I was driving home on the freeway. It seems to have been snapped at the clip, and in the same area the windshield has a crack, if I had to guess, something was dropped on the car in this area which caused this.

So pretty disappointed at that. I called right after this happened and asked to speak to the general manager, and after being put through to multiple "how can I direct your call"'s, someone finally told me he wasn't in, but he would call me tomorrow. But I've not received a call still.  I received a follow up email, (which had nothing to do with my complaint), and I posted all of this in reply, no response from that either.

So I’ve got a broken part, a cracked windshield, and no one will even talk to me. At this point I’m cutting my losses and will continue to go to my original Subaru dealer, even though it is 2 hours away.

Also the courtesy shuttle service was abysmal. Us three passengers needed to constantly tell the driver where to go, even though we'd given him addresses and he'd put these into his phone. He had Google maps open in front of him and continued to take wrong turns and also ask us where to go (with the map in front of him..). The trip from the dealership to my work took nearly an hour. Given that it's 6.5 miles I really should have just taken an Uber.

The estimates for service time were also a bit annoying. Generally when I ask how long it will take, other dealerships are pretty accurate. 2 hours usually means 1 hour 45 mins. In the case here, I dropped off my car at 7 when my appointment was, I was told 2 hours, which fit well with my work schedule. At 10:30 I still hadn't heard anything so I called in, then at 12:25 I finally got the call that my car was ready.  I've got no problems with the service taking 5 hours, but just tell me 5 hours at the start... Don't tell me 2, because I will plan my day around that.

Anyway, I hate giving negative feedback, as I generally love the service I get at Subaru but I definitely won't be returning to Steven's creek.< /review>

The overall experience of buying a car here was very good. Shane was very forthright and clear about everything from the beginning. Even post-sale they maintain a good relationship with the customer. Also the speed at which they work is pretty impressive. Would recommend Stevens Creek Subaru to anyone looking to buy a Subaru.</Review>

<time>1504634940828< /time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Did my research prior to contacting the dealer for a 2017 or 2018 Subaru Foresters XT Touring. Three local dealers had the Dark Gray with Saddle Brown interior that I wanted. Reached out to the three internet sales and Stevens Creek Subaru was the closest to me and one of the least expensive for the same vehicles, not to mention I've purchases two other vehicles there in the past (2004 WRX  and a 2007 Tribeca B9 from Masood).

Shane Amirkiai emailed me back with his price and we quickly set up an appointment to see the car. Very relaxed and very personable. Answered any questions I had, but didn't waste my time. He was honest and made the process stress free. I was given a fair price for my trade in and the finance guy was also very relaxed and made the process super easy, quick and painless.  There was no painful haggling and they even got me extra discounts because I was a prior Subaru customer that I wasn't expecting.

I would very much recommend Shane to anyone out there looking for a Subie. Thank you Shane! So far I'm loving the 2018 Forester XT Touring.< /Text>< Pics>

Boy, what a day it was. We arrived early afternoon to test-drive an Outback with Kat, loved it, then got into involved discussion about options we need vs. the ones we think we need, reviewed relative merits of light and dark interiors, took a closer look at the EyeSight (which rocks 20/20) and so on. One thing led to another and I freely admit part of it is a blur, but I know we had fun and now there's an Outback in our garage. Great advice on car insurance was a nice bonus. Thank you, Kat - you have our respect!</review>

<review>Poor experience over and over again. I came here twice. I was ready to buy a WRX. Salesman couldn't care less about my experience, and I was allowed to do a 5 minute test drive. You want me to drop 30K after driving a car for 5 minutes? Didn't know much about the car either.

I figured it was just an unmotivated sales rep and came back with my gf another time. She was interested in purchasing a vehicle also. Different sales guy but once again complete lack of interest in her needs.

Third time's a charm. I contacted them via chat regarding a WRX automatic (which is rare). Sales guy did not read my request at all. I wouldn't ask for a rare automatic if I could easily buy a manual(...)

Please don't waste your time at this dealership. They don't care about the customer, don't understand the customer's needs and are unmotivated to sell you anything. Horrible experience.<//review>< UserId.>

I just bought my dream car from Shane at Stevens Creek Subaru.  I have been dreaming about this car for 2 years and got such a great deal and had such a great experience.  When I left with the dealership, I asked myself why people think that buying a car is so difficult.

I first came in contact with Shane though the internet and was given a quote for the exact car I wanted (color and options).  This quote was such a great price, I decided to go down to the dealership to check out this car.  I though maybe it was bait to get my down there.  Nope, when I got there, it was right out front calling my name.  Then I thought, they are going to nickel and dime me back up to the sticker price of the car.  Nope, that didn't happen either.

Needless to say, I walked out of there with a new shiny car that I didn't have to fight for and it had more options in it then the competitors were offering for much higher prices.

Hats off Stevens Creek Subaru and to Shane. Thanks for the great experience.<//Text>

<Text>Salesman was genuinely helpful and knowledgeable. He did not push. When we wanted to return to make a purchase, he was there waiting for us with the vehicle we had expressed interest in set aside for us to look at. We were offered an excellent price right away and did not have to spend time negotiating. I think the service contract is actually worth doing and I am happy about being able to extend the warranty to 100,000 miles. I did not feel like anyone was trying to take advantage of us; I felt like here were people with good cars who were being reasonable about the way they sold them. It was by far our best car purchase experience ever, and we have bought 6 other vehicles in the past. It was also the quickest.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Shane was awesome to work with. He quoted me the best price out of the half dozen dealerships I had been talking to, and was willing to answer any questions I had and show me the breakdown of the lease order when I asked. He wasn't pushy, but let me know that he wasn't going to forget about me, either, as I finalized my decision to lease from them. He put in a special order for exactly what I wanted, which ended up coming in to the dealership about a month early.

When we showed up to the dealership to finish the paperwork (we had started it online, and had planned to do it all online, but the car came in early), he just had such a great personality and seemed so open, which put us at ease. We never felt like he wasn't being straight with us or trying to push unwanted accessories, etc. He took lots of time to show us how to use all the features of the car and made sure we were all set before saying goodbye. I highly recommend talking to him for your next purchase/lease!</Text>

Beware. Service department under new management.

I came in for a recall and asked the service advisor to have them listen to my transmission during the test drive, once my air bag was replaced. I was told they would have to charge me $300. Never had this experience before with other dealerships, nobody charges for test drives. Will not return.</review>

<text>Probably one of the worst / lazy sales representatives here. First took their time checking who was available. The sales rep shook our hands and explained us the different outback models which we wanted to buy.

Ask for a test drive- he was lazy to come with us . Instead was asking other sales reps whether they can go. That went on for about 5 mins.

Finally someone decided to come along with us for test drive.

The car was low of fuel. Estimated mile range was showing 5 miles :)

We test drove within the city. I told the sales rep guy we will come back cause we were already down. He said ok. Just ok. And never shook hands or never got  up some to say thanks for coming to Subaru etc etc.

You lost a genuine customer I would say.</text>< pics>

Very pathetic customer service ever. The sales guy gave us an offer  with 0 percent Apr and later while we are about to sign the papers they increased the Apr to 5 percent thereby equating the offer they gave by increasing the Apr. Luckily we saw the details before signing.

Playing tricks with customers and cant be trusted at all. No integrity !< /Text>

We went there because of an advertising add for a truck. At the end it turned out the truck was not for the amount advertised for. We called and we spoke with the person on the ad. He said yes they had that truck advertised.  that person wound up saying it was an advertising mistake. We wasted our time for nothing. That person was right in saying it was a mistake because it showed us how careless they are for allowing a false advertising. oooo</Review>

I purchased a Forester this month. Shane was my sales person. From the time I requested a quote on the internet till today (a few weeks after car had been delivered), he is in touch with me for any questions/concerns, very patient and detail oriented in answering them. There are few dealerships who don't care about you post purchase, this is not one of them. I'd recommend Stevens Creek Subaru & Shane for any one who is considering a new Subaru!. These guys are really nice to work with.</text>

I am very disappointed with my service appointment I had here yesterday.
I have an issue with video from rear view camera - it’s glitching and freezing sometimes. Yes, it doesn’t happen every time you park, but it happens often enough when you drive car every day. And it could be dangerous. It’s my first car and I really rely on its safety features. My service advisor told me that they run all tests and everything is fine with my car and there is nothing they can do. They couldn’t reproduce my concerns. They said that I could return to them if this issue would become worse. But it’s already bad enough, so what do they want from me? To crash my car during parking?
I bought this car in Atlanta in August 2017, I have this issue since December. Service advisors in Classic Subaru of Atlanta where I bought this car were trying to help me, at least they didn’t deny I have a problem. And they reproduced it with me. But I just moved to California, so I had to go to the new Subaru service in order to find solution to this issue, but they said they couldn’t reproduce freezing and small glitching is normal. It’s not small and it’s not normal. Also guys from Stevens Creek Subaru refused to contact service advisor from Atlanta, saying they have everything they need here.
I will never buy Subaru again.</Review>

Great cars horrible lying cheating sales people. Read your paperwork carefully before you sign. They say one thing and put down something else for you to sign on. This happened to me twice at this dealership. I signed for a 3 year lease and today after having the car for one year I find out my maintenance program is only for 2 years which is not what we had discussed. I can't believe a company like Subaru would have such thieves representing their company. When I went to talk to them they said they couldn't pull up the original documents which makes no sense. This will be the last of my business with this disgusting, manipulative and lying dealership.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I went in for Express Service... asked for an oil change and for the tires to be rotated and balanced.  I was quoted a price for each and accepted.  When I drove off after service I noticed that the steering wheel shook badly upon reaching 55mph.  I called the service department to set up a return appointment for them to fix the balance as they obviously hadn't done a good job.  Imagine my surprise when they told me that they had only rotated the tires, as I hadn't requested a balance.  Besides that, a balance costs $100 and I had only been charged the $25 to rotate tires.  Had they told me from the beginning how much this service cost I would have skipped it... Especially considering most tire shops charge about $40.  This is complete FRAUD in my opinion.  I asked for something, was quoted a price, accepted and then found out it was only part of what I asked for. Now my only option is to go in and pay for a hugely overpriced service with people who've already shown themselves to be untrustworthy.   Buyer beware....

Robert is da man! He helped us get into a nice Mercedes Benz. My wife and I were looking for a car for a few months. I can tell you that Robert treated us differently from the start. He listened to us and was able to work with us to get the payment we wanted. He also spoke Spanish which made things even more comfortable.

I brought my 2013 Outback to the dealership in Sunnyvale for an oil consumption test.  They change my car oil and told me to bring it back after  1200 miles which I did. They checked the oil level and told me that there was no drop in the oil level so that was the end of the test.  I didn't understand why test was designed for only 1200 miles.  My car burned 1.5-2 quarts of oil in between oil change which is every 7000 miles!  So I called another dealership at Capital Subaru and they told me that I can take the test up to 3 times, bringing the car in every 1200 miles for a total of 3600 miles.  I called the Sunnyvale dealership back and told them what the Capital Subaru dealership told me and asked them why would they only give the oil test for 1200 mile and the person that responded (Dante?) said that was the guideline from Subaru of America. Of course I followed up with SoA and here's their response:
"The oil consumption testing specification is up to 1 Quart in 3,600 miles. In this testing, the retailer changes your oil and you return several times at 1,200 mile intervals without adding any oil to the engine. This allows the retailer to establish the precise oil usage of your engine. "

So either he didn't know what he was talking about or he didn't want to be bothered with my problem.  You can imagine my frustration with this dealership.</Text>

Hamid was especially patient, took me and my entire family for a test drive in both Outback and Forster, including putting in car seats and everything. I initially wanted the Forster, but Hamid recommended the Outback. I followed his advice and I'm very happy with my choice. Great sales person with no bs.

<Review>Ben helped us when we came in to this dealership looking for a legacy. We were not sure if we were going to buy a car that day but we felt very comfortable with Ben and the way he handled all the questions we threw at him. It seemed like he was genuinely concerned with selling us the right car instead of just selling A car. We did take one home that day and we are very happy with our experience and would most definitely recommend him to anyone!!<//Review>< time>

Stevens Creek Subaru was the only dealership that responded promptly to an internet quote request. Aydin and Shane helped us thoroughly through the buying process. Both explained everything about the car and made the buying process a pleasant experience. They also offered a price much lower than their competitors.</Review>

My Outback has had battery issues for a while -- where the back hatch wouldn't open or I needed to jump start the car. But I always thought there was a reason why the batter may be low -- e.g., maybe I left the hatch open too long... But I had to jump start my car 2 times in one week. So I decided to bring my car in for service. It turns out the batter needed to be replaced AND my car had 36360 miles. So 360 miles out of warranty. I was not happy that the batter needed to be replaced when the car is not even 2.5 years old. The service coordinator spoke with the warranty manager to replace the battery and cover it. I was grateful for his thoughtfulness.</review>

<review>Stay far away from these rude and unprofessional people. There are so many Subaru dealers in the Bay; don't go here. The sales process is initially fine until they make you wait in a crummy office for 3 hours as they prep their "closer" to try to sell you a bunch of add-ons you don't need.  Extremely condescending and disrespectful service advisors who are not at all concerned with offering competent or kind service. They do not care about customers' time. This dealership is lucky that Subaru has spent decades developing brand loyalty because they are relying on that to get people in the door...and then ritualistically violating that trust with every subsequent interaction. Awful and sad.<//review>< pics>

They recommended changing the timing belt and water pump for $1000 plus $1000 worth of elective maintenance like changing spark plugs and cleaning the fuel injectors and inspecting various components on the car.  AFTER performing all the elective maintenance they called to tell me that the inspection indicated that my axle should be replaced and that it would cost another $1000.  A properly functioning service organization would have performed the inspection at the start, called to let me know that the necessary scope of work had changed, and helped me prioritize the repairs.

A bolt was left off my car from the wheel well. No reason to remove this since it is not in the way when replacing tires so not sure why they removed it. Front bumper keeps popping out. Way to go dealership - mess up cars to get them back in.

Additional Edit - Tried calling back only to be told that managers cannot be paged and to leave a voice mail. Zero customer service support.<//Text>

The maintenance for the vehicle was done well, expensive but taken care of. I also had issues with my stereo fading in and out (reported electrical issues with 17' Outbacks I understand) so they replaced it with a new one. Well, new one does the exact same thing, maybe even more than the last. It would be a huge inconvenience to drop the car off a 3rd time since the first took two visits.
Lastly, I happened to bring the car in when we had extremely high winds and one of the guys moving the cars from the line you wait to drop off your car in lost control of another's door and it slammed into my passenger side leaving a 3 inch deep crease in the door. I know it wasn't on purpose but he should have been more careful.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1552948896038, 'text': 'We are disappointed to hear that you did not have a more positive experience with us at Stevens Creek Subaru.

< Review>
I bought my SO at this dealership, and have been taking my car here for regular service for a couple of years. However, I'm calling it quit and taking my car else where for service. The service reps are nice, but the mechanics (at least the ones doing oil change) are terrible.

When I first bought the car, I also purchased the Teflon package. So I left the car there over night for the Teflon coating. However, when I went to pick up the car, I noticed they detailed the car but didn't applied the Teflon coating as promised. The sales rep checked, confirmed, and I had to leave the car there for an additional day for the job to be done right. This is a clear indication that I should take my car else where, but I thought it could be an honest mistake.

Over the 2 years that I've taken my car to Stevens Creek Subaru for regular service, they've forgotten to put the oil cap back on, didn't change the service sticker, and among others. The final straw for me was this last service, where they didn't tighten the oil pan nut. So oil was leaking all over my driveway. I took it back and they fixed it, but I had to really cleanup all the oil leaked on my driveway.

My Outback is about due for major services, such as brakes and tune-ups, as it's nearing 45K. My question is if they can't do a simple oil service right consistently, how can I trust them to take care of the more important services. The answer is I can't. So I'm going else where.

I took my Outback to another dealership today and request a history of the services done on my car. It turns out, that the folks at Stevens Creek Subaru didn't complete all the items they were supposed to do, and some are done out of order. This is alarming to me. So my recommendation to Stevens Creek Subaru owner, is to evaluate and revamp the service dept. to get it in order. I'm also recommending other Subaru owners to take their vehicle else where, until Stevens Creek Subaru dealership have fixed the service dept and is more reliable/dependable.<//Review>

<Text>Hands down the best service and experience I've received purchasing a new car. I took home a brand new 5 door Impreza with the help of Shane. No pressure what so ever, easy to talk to, feels like you're buying a car off your friend. I first reached out to Stevens creek Subaru to get a quote, after a few back and forth e mails with Shane when I finally went to the dealership, the rest was smooth sailing. Thank you Shane & S.C. Subaru I'm very very happy with my car.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I had an issue with the vehicle I was going to buy and they were more than accommodating and honest about it. They located me a similar vehicle and adjusted the sales price.

Aydin was hard working and great to work with! Ask for him!< /review></record>

<Text>We shopped around several dealerships and brands to ensure we picked the vehicle we liked the most. Your dealership was the only one where the sales person was not aggressive in pushing our urgency to buy.  He was also the only one who didn't loose interest and continued to build report while knowing I wasn't going to buy the first time I visited.  We came back and he recognized and greeted me by name.  We felt comfortable thought the whole transaction.  Our salesman was Peyman.
We then moved to finance with Ali, who was also very professional and personable.  We also felt comfortable though that process as well.  We will definitely recommend your dealership and staff by name when talking to friends, family, or co-workers, who may be looking to purchase a car.<//Text><user>117631427703690711637</user>< resp>

Kat helped us throughout the experience, she took us on several test drive for different models and even several times with the same model until we made sure we have the right choice! she was also very knowledgeable about the all the models and options and had answers ready for all questions, her personalized experience and the tailored advise and recommendations gave an extra edge to purchase from this dealership.

2 days later we had a problem with the battery, we took the car back to the service center and they tested and replaced it without any questions while providing a loaner car of the same model to use while the car was being serviced! this was awesome! To my knowledge only (luxury) brands provide this level of service and it was certainly a pleasant surprise!

Overall, Kat gets 5 stars! and the services team get 5 stars.

I just wish the actual buying process was a bit simpler :)</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I went to 4 car dealerships in San Jose, out of all 4 dealerships, Stevens Creek Subaru made the others look amateur. SCS customer service, professionalism, and respect is 5 star, and it was a plus that they also have a relationship with the Credit Union I bank at. I definitely will buy another vehicle from Stevens Creek Subaru.</review>

Don't go here At all! For any reason at all. Worst customer service I have ever had. Guy in parts (not sure his name) was a complete idiot and had no idea what he was talking about.  Then proceeded to give me the wrong part. Over charge for it and then tell me that I wouldn't be able to return the part until Monday. When I finally had the manager refund me the money they gave me change in all pennies. I personally will never return to this retailer and urge everyone in the bay to do the same.< /Review>

< review>
I have never been treated so rudely by a sales associate. From the onset of my time shopping for a car, the sales associate acted as if my questions were an irritant and treated me with disrespect. Several times he said, "I already explained this to you" when I asked about important things to consider when buying a car including safety features, the vehicle's ability to function off road, and features associated with upgrades. While the associate did explain some of the answers previously, I was unsure of how the information he provided before applied to my new question and would not know this without a thorough understanding of cars. The associate's reactions to me lead me to feel as if I must be "stupid." I recognize that an experience with one sales associate is not necessarily a reflection of the customer service of an entire dealership, but people should not be treated as I was, particularly when shopping for a big ticket item. I have worked in sales for many years and cannot imagine treating someone the way I was treated. My family will certainly not be shopping at this dealer.<//review>

After a long drive from Oregon to San Jose, we were very happy that the car met and exceeded our expectations.   We would like to thank Chip and Shane for helping us with the fastest car purchase we have ever made!
The only drawback of the experience was that California rules require Oregonian purchasers to either pay California sales tax or freight the car out. Since we hadn’t planned on sales tax we chose to freight the car.  This is not due to Steven’s Creek Subaru and we would highly recommend the dealership.<//Review>< Rate>

Kat was awesome to work with.

She got me into a BRZ very quickly and she communicated very thoroughly every step of the way.

I went to the dealer a few months before and found no real assistance. I decided to come in after selling my vehicle last week and found her luckily. She is truly great. My credit wasn't the best and she still managed to fight tooth and nail to get me a rate that I could afford.

I highly recommend her for any future car buying endeavors!

Ask for Kat!< /Text>

Worst experience in this dealer. 3 SUBARU dealers in SV, I will never come back to this dealer. They cheat customer, the advisor charge me much more than the other two dealers for engine oil change. The manager is not honest, he just want to sell more maintanence plan and extend warranty to you, but when you come back, they will tell you the plan your car is not cover with the plan you bought. They can cheat customer once, but never again.< /Review>

Absolutely terrible service department. Completely ignored me when I came in for my appointment. After standing around for twenty minutes, the person I was supposed to see walked out of the building, and the other workers had to run around looking for him. My issue (broken windshield due to a defect) had an NTSB notice that it should be repaired asap and that the dealer should not go through the usual warranty authorization steps. I tried to tell then this and was ignored. I even had the NTSB notice with me and they refused to look at it.

I thought ok, it'll just take an extra week for the authorization. Next up, they had to take pictures of the crack on the windshield. Took three separate attempts because the guy kept messing up when entering them on the computer. On the last try I knew he screwed up again, and sure enough later that night he called me to say I had to come in next week to redo the pictures because he messed up.

Instead I went to Premiere Subaru of Fremont. They were extremely professional and courteous, read through the NTSB notice and realized they didn't need to do the warranty authorization, took a few pictures (and got it right the first time), and ordered a new windshield all within half an hour.< /review>

Matt K was great.  We felt welcomed and he took time to answer our questions without any of the " pressure" I was concerned about in purchasing a new car.  In emails , phone and in person he was responsive and friendly!  Also very relatable, understood the needs of driving Hwy 17 and living in the mountains. I brought in the "build"  and emailed it to him earlier and got a price over the phone. I liked no surprises and getting exactly what I wanted. He was also recommended to us by a friend. Its interesting that what I appreciated ie- no pitch - time to think , making sure ALL my questions were answered but not dumping info on me  unasked was perceived as a negative in other review.< /Review>

Horrible! Don’t even think of going here... the salesperson did not even bother showing us a car, was super arrogant, didn’t care enough to ask us what we were looking for! So arrogant!
Worst experience ever!< /review>

Dismal Salesman and Tactics.  Drove 70 miles after being told a price on a 2018 Legacy and when we sat down the salesmen (Sisay/Berry) added an extra $100 on the sale of the car.  What an absolute joke this salesmen is.  He kept referring to his "manager" and the "owners" of the dealer as the excuse as to why he needed to take an extra $100 from us.  We walked out.  He chased us per usual sales tactics.  What sucks is the dude lost a sale over it.  No follow up or apology from him either.  2 weeks later we bought from Walnut Creek Subaru.  Go there.  Much better salesmen and nicer people.  Livermore is also better however they're small.<//Text>

My wife and I bought a new car here last weekend and that was the best car buying experience of our life. HAMID, the salesman, is a delightful person, always friendly and smiling.

Usually, when you buy a car the sales people is pushing you all the time to get stuff you don't really need and guarantee extensions you won't use. And when it comes to money, they always tell you they're not having any profit with the deal they are giving to you. Not to mention the anxious looks, the pressure on time, the resistance to give you details about anything ... NONE OF THIS HAPPENED WITH SC SUBARU, they were simply amazing and we had the chance to negotiate a very nice deal and get an excellent car.

I seriously recommend SC Subaru to anyone buying a new car. As I told you before, this was by far the best buying experience of my life.</Text>

My salesperson Mr. Azim was very helpful and knowledgable. He was a great source of information about the vehicle I was interested in. Working with him was a real pleasure. For his personal performance, he deserves 5 stars! Some other bumps in the buying process made me take off one star for the over-all dealership evaluation.</review>

When you ask for an inspection service over the phone and an appointment is made for you, the last thing you expect is the customer service team to tell you off when you arrive. This is what happened when I brought in my Forester. There was a botch job done on my struts and alignment and I just needed a basic inspection to see the damages, which I was scheduled to have with Stevens Creek Subaru. Upon arriving, the service rep tells me there is nothing he could do in terms of a general inspection and that he wouldn't find anything unless I paid him $300 "per noise". Another shop down the street was able to inspect the damages in all of 5 minutes and tell me the issue. They also deemed the vehicle not safe to drive, a dismissal that Subaru wouldn't bat an eye at. This was for a court order - severely disappointed in Stevens Creek Subaru for wasting my time and efforts. I am embarrassed to be a Subaru Ambassador and will be bringing this to the attention of corporate.<//text>

I am really disappointed about the service every time I contact the dealership. They will put me on hold for 10 minutes, just to ask me what I am calling about over and over again and always putting me back on hold. After 20 minutes someone finally takes the call and talks about a completely different topic, that I am not calling about. Really bad overall organization of how to professionally take and transfer calls.<//Text>

Ridiculous. I specifically schedule weeks in advance for the airbag recall to NOT leave my car since I need it within hours. I show up, wait 20min for someone to see me only to be told that they need to keep the car all day or possibly till the next morning.
So there’s no point in giving the option to stay and wait for the repairs.
Tons of spammy emails from Subaru urging me to quickly come in and fix it. Not worth it, I’ll take my chances in an accident

Edit: Main frustration is I was offered no options. Just leave my keys and walk home. Just scheduled with Capitol Subaru and they immediately set up a loaner vehicle.< /Text>

<review>I brought in a vehicle that had seen the salt of New England and New York for 6 years. I knew the brake pads were worn pretty thin and the car needed regular maintenance anyways.

Sal, my service rep, recommended a change of the entire brake system. Something not cheap, but considering all brake parts were pretty rusted and worn, probably a worthy investment. I'm glad that he was frank about the costs upfront, instead of trying to upsell me after I had agreed to the service.

The service was performed by Nadim, and I can say the brake assembly looked brand new at the end of the service.  Due to the amount of corrosion on the underside of the car, the job ended up taking 2 more days than expected. As a result, Sal gave me a loaner car, which was not part of the contract, but an act I appreciated greatly.

Service was high quality, frank and easy to work with. Many thanks to Sal and Nadim!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Not offering car wash after the prepaid car maintenance. This is my second time coming here in the last two years. Everytime I hear the excuse that the car wash machine is not working or something. Usually other dealers in the area offer a car wash, including Subaru dealers.

Too bad not gonna come back here ever.< /review>

We came in to look for a Crosstrek and met with Ben. He was very professional and took the time to show us the features of the car and explained all the available options. It's hard to find non-pushy sales people nowadays and we liked him enough that we ended up buying a car that day. We got a pretty decent deal as well. Thank you Ben!</Text>

Called this place and the lady on the line said they did have the new ascent in stock and if I want to come in and test drive.  Surprisingly I repeated really you have the new 3 row Ascent?? And she replied as if she was annoyed by me “yes the 2019 yes”
I said cool I’m on my way.

Sure enough when I get here the guy says not until end of July . Don’t you just hate when people act like they know what your talking about but really don’t know jack $&@:@! Then talk to you as if you don’t know what your talking about?
The lot has mixed cars all over the place as well. Not sure if it’s a used car place or what but I’m going with a friends advice and driving to Dublin Livermore area to get my sub. Hear they are a percent cheaper as we already are aware of this</text>

<review>This review is for the service deparment:

I had a bad experience with my outback service. Took the car for an express service and a service rep by the name German came to help. He said it would take 1 to 1 and half hours and asked me to wait in the waiting area. I forgot to tell him about a recall service which I told him around the 1 hr mark. He said he would sneak this recall service in with the original service. After 1 and half hours I went to check on the status and was told that the recall service was not done and that I had to wait for extra 45 to 1 hour. Here I was not happy that he did not inform me about the extra wait time. I said I will come back for the recall service. After a minute or so he told me that the original service was never done!! That was my tipping point. I expressed my frustration and pointed to him that the vehicle was sitting idle in the parking lot all this time without any work being done on it.The rep was not courteous and he had a weird expression on his face during this interaction.
I would not go back to this center, never again.

Below was the original review for my car purchase:

So apparently appointment times don’t matter anymore. Your not guaranteed your time slot anymore. It’s first come first serve. So what’s the point of still having the appointment app if your not going to honor it? It would be common courtesy to post it on your site and for all regular customers.< /text>

<Review>Looked at a Subaru BRZ here, and while I wasn't able to make a deal happen I have to say that my interactions with the salesman Chip were quite good. Stevens Creek didn't have quite the stock I really wanted so I ended up going to another dealership (Capitol ended up having the right car with me just being really ready to buy when I was doing my comparisons), but given my interactions with Chip I would have preferred to have given my business to him rather than Capitol.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Subaru brand loyalty goes a lonnnnngggg way. I love Subaru's for their safety, style, and longevity.
Mike Marsh is like no other! He's the wicked best car salesman on the planet. Not phony, pushy, arrogant, or a stuffed shirt. He's extremely knowledgeable, friendly, genuine, and the real-deal. This is my 3rd used Subaru, and again well-maintained by its previous owner. Plus, the auto darkening rear-view mirror is a HUGE bonus, for safety at night, and reducing eye-strain. Check Mike Marsh out at Stevens Creek Subaru in Santa Clara, I couldn't be more pleased.<//Text>

<Text>Expensive and the service people aren't the most helpful. I went to Carlsen up in Redwood City and saved $16 on both of the coolant caps needed for the Impreza turbo lines. They wanted $75 and tax for an oil change and I supplied the oil and filter. They will gouge you for basic services like this and then tell you to beat it if you question it. I'll never take my Forester back there, nor will I replace it through them when the time comes.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1536762797782, 'text': 'We appreciate your feedback.

I accompanied my friend who was buying a used Outback.  She thought the terms of her purchase had been completed prior to her arrival.  However, we were at the dealership 2+ hours.  The easiest part of the process was working with Cemal Unal, Finance Manager.  He was knowledgeable and provided a lot of information about her purchase and warranties.  His kind personality made the paperwork easy.  Thank you, Cemal.</Text>

Terrible service team.

Took my car in months ago for alignment and other maintenance. When I got my car back it was pull to the right really bad. I took my car back in to have that fixed and my head unit replaced (it was previously ordered).

When I picked up my car here is what I found: key fob was broken, dashboard was clearly warped from the head unit swap, they forgot to move over the head  unit memory card and the alignment was not addressed at all. Instead of helping me the service advisor gave me the card of the service manager and told me to deal with the issue with him.

I reached out to the service manager via email with pictures of the issues to get the ball rolling and received no reply for days so I called in and left a voicemail. I still received no reply after a week so I asked for the GM to call me and never received a call back. I had to contact Subaru of America to then reach out to their service manager to call me back.

I brought my car in to service manager (who had no idea why I was there or that he had asked me to come in at 7am). He was very rude and told me this was the last time he would do a "courtesy" request from Subaru for me. That is ridiculous because this was a workmanship issue that I had to waste weeks reaching out to people to get resolved.

So I take my car in again once they received my replacement key. They were asked to address all of the issues- dashboard, key, and alignment. This time when I picked up my car they only fixed the key. The alignment was still pulling and worst of all they said nothing was wrong with the dashboard. I took the service advisor (different from the one that was aware of the issue because he had left for the day) to my car and pointed out the warped material around the head unit. He said he would leave a note for my service advisor to follow up. Of course 2 weeks passed and that never happened.

I called in to setup a new appointment with the original service advisor and brought the car in this morning. I was told that the service advisor was out and would not be back for another week.

This is the type of customer service this dealership provides. The service advisors don't care about you or your car and that is because their service manager doesn't either. All I wanted was to have my issues resolved and nothing beyond that but it is obviously too much to ask.

tl;dr: poor customer service and they don't care</Review>< pics>

<review>Last week was the last time that I brought our car to this dealership for service. I’m done with this place.
We bought our Outback here in 2012 and brought it to the dealership for service ever since. The price of their service is constancy increasing while the quality of their customer service decreased a lot. They just keep recommending services without even really checking what the car needs. You almost at 78k miles you should get an intermediate service. I asked if they could check on squeaking noise that comes from the back of the car and the service advisor said sure no problem. The trouble shooting fee will be $300! What the heck? Are you kidding me? I ended up paying $600 for an intermediate service (without having the squeaking noise examined) and they now don’t even offer a complementary car wash anymore. They don’t offer coupons and deals either anymore as they used to. When I picked up the car the service advisor told me that the brake pads are getting low. I ask him how that could be since we got the brake pads replaced (by this dealership) just a year ago. He couldn’t really explain why this might be the case and just said that they only measure it and let me know. Thank you very much. The dealership usually always sends me a survey to fill out after I went there for service, but it has been a week already and I haven’t received a survey this time. Guess they might have expected that the result will not be pretty this time.
If you have too much money and don’t mind bad customer service you should bring your car to this dealership. I will go somewhere else in the future.< /review><Time>1525149752076< /Time>< pics>

<Review>Shane was awesome to deal with.  He was very quick with his responses via email prior to our visit.  Shane respected the fact that my husband used to work as an F & I Manager one time.  So everything Shane presented was real.  It was also good to know that the internet inventory was accurate.  We were looking for a very specific Legacy with package.  Also loved that Shane quoted a few alternatives along with exactly we were looking for, just for comparission.  Shane was very knowledgeable and went over all the important features including the Eyesight.<//Review>< gmapID>

I showed them a video and your service crew actually saw my RPM moving back and forth from 500 to 1000 rpm. It was never fixed since your OBD II scanner did not find any fault. Bottom line, the rough idling never got fixed and even blamed Costco's cheaper fuel as the culprit. Costco's fuel is top tier btw. Cars lined up at their stations to get gas. There is a problem with BRZ/frs/gt86 with rough idling just check the thousands of threads online. I will contact the BAR regarding this issue. If I can only give no star review.< /Text>< resp>

I could not be happier. I've been so many bad experiences with a different Subaru that everything was set right I have so much confidence in my car and that it's running exactly the way it should be I would never go anywhere but here.< /review>

Worst customer experience of any car dealership. They failed to file a Release of Liability to the DMV per the DMV's request, won't return voicemails, and now hang up the phone when I call to figure out why they didn't submit a standard form to the DMV. 2 months of financial liabilities incurred on a car now owned by Stevens Creek possession!<//Review>

<username>Roy Mac<//username><text>I have never encountered such lathargic Service Advisors anywhere.  I t took an hour and a half to drop off my car and get a loaner.  Everything was done serially - I tried to get them process the loaner car paperwork in parallel - Everything had to go into it's own inefficient queue.  So much for having an appt.  I could go on but I suspect this rant will not change a thing.  If I were in charge, there is definitely one incompetent person I would give some stern counseling.  I do hope readers of this do not get stuck with him.  This could really be so much better if a little thought is put behind how they operate their business.</text><Time>1537319727750<//Time>< user_id>

They messed up my oil change - I asked for sythentic, they didn't check my power steering fluid like I asked. Then they called and asked about my experience, I reported it was poor, and they said they'd get back to me. The next time they called, months later, they had no information about me. Later, they mailed materials to me. I called and asked to be removed from their mailing lists, citing the above. They said I was removed. But I have template mailers in my mailbox.

I don't trust them with my car.
I don't trust them with my information.
I don't trust them to follow directions.
I will never return.<//text>

I am happy to recommend Michael Marsh, my sales consultant at Stevens Creek Subaru. I drove 120 miles from Sacramento to purchase a 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek, and my experience was worth every mile of the journey! Everyone at the dealership was very friendly. From the moment I stepped onto the lot, I was greeted by a courteous staff and made to feel welcome. The dealership itself is beautiful. Impeccably clean, well stocked and inviting. I contacted Michael Marsh while searching for a specific model with very specific features. He went above and beyond to locate and deliver exactly what I was looking for. He provided accurate information regarding the vehicle, the price I would pay, and the terms by which it would be sold. This is the first time I've ever purchased a Subaru; I only wish I had discovered them sooner! All in all, it was a great purchasing experience. From the start, I was treated with respect and made to feel like a welcome guest. The process of taking delivery was smooth, relaxed and ultimately rewarding. I'm VERY happy with my car. It's everything I had hoped it would be and more! Michael was a joy to work with and I am happy to recommend him to anyone who expresses interest in obtaining a Subaru. He's a gentleman through and through and takes the time to listen to what you want and finds a way to deliver. I'm very grateful for his kind assistance, and for the wonderful atmosphere at Stevens Creek Subaru!</Review>

These people agreed to sell me a car at a specific price on email- then wont reply- yet continue advertise vehicle and mark it down by $100 each week- they agree to sell it to me almost 2500 less than listed- manager must not have liked it- as now they ignore me. Waste of my time- and after reading all the super bad info about them- a blessing in disguise that I got one elsewhere!!!!< /Review>< Rate>

I worked with Mike Marsh to buy my 2015 Impreza.  He was super knowledgeable on all the models i test drove (3 total) and very patient as I worked out which one to get.  I  didn't feel rushed or pressured - a pleasantly surprising outcome at a dealership.< /text>

< Review>
I hate this place service is really bad. My car oil light keep went on I came here and the service provider urghh so careless. It pissed me off that even when they done with my car he didnt even call me and I have to called in to know that my car ready to pickup. When I came to pickup he gave me attitude answer that my car is okay. Are you kidding me ? it okay then why I drove for every 300 to 400 miles then light goes on when I just did my oil change. I would never come here to purchase or service car ever again. Worse experience everrrrr</Review>

They did a great job getting us a new Impreza at the best price in the Bay Area. No hassles, no hard sell. Chip was really great and stayed 2-3 hours after he was supposed to go home in order to help us finish up the paperwork and everything else.< /Text>

< Review>
Trying to get a new car, and the dealer here is the worst I have seen, the name is Julio. I walked in and wanna try two different models, and this gentlemen told me, you have to decide which one you gonna buy before we can give you the test drive..... I tell him I cannot decide before I do the test drive and want to feel what's the engine and break likes. He told me all the car is the same. He was trying to push me make a decision to buy before I can even have a test drive, and says there's no car available right now, and have to make an appointment for tmr. Are you kidding me? Car dealer have no car available? I've regretted I made appointment for next day, should have left immediately, and try another dealer.< /Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>I came in on Monday to look for a new car (I was initially trying to find a 5 year old used car, but realized that Subaru's retain such a high secondary market price that it was just worth getting a new one).

Came in and met with Chip Miller in their sales team.  I told him my exact situation, what I'm looking for, budget (as well as what I really wanted to spend).  He showed me all the options that fit my criteria, never pushed one or the other.  He did not try to upsell more expensive models, just told me what my options are and answered questions.  I kind of wish he put a bit more pressure on me, as the car that I really originally wanted was sold later that day.  Came in the next day, he worked diligently to match the price/discount of the same car but different color.  Financing for someone like me with so so credit is always a challenge, but their finance person Jason worked with me not just get approval, but layer out various options, we had to go back to the drawing board three times.  Was extremely pleased that the rate was well below what I had anticipated.

After driving off with the car on Tuesday, I came back with some question on Friday.  Even though the sales was complete, Chip took the time again to answer my questions, including walking out to my car and showing me some of the most basic things that I don't know... like how to use bluetooth.

My first car purchase experience was nothing but smooth and efficient, I highly recommend Chip and the team to anybody.

FYI i have also used their services in the past, and I think it's also been very good.  They tell you what is wrong, what they recommend, and various options.< /review>< user_name>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I would definitely recommend Stevens Creek Subaru after a terrific buying experience for my first Subaru, an Imprezza Wagon.  Shane A.  made the whole process very streamlined and straightforward.  He was able to get me the specific trim/color before any other dealer in the Bay Area and presented a very competitive price.    The team there worked around my busy schedule and was very knowledgeable about Subaru brand and values it espouses: reliability, safety and simplicity.  I would not hesitate to buy my next vehicle from them.  Also to note, I did not use their financing arm.< /Review>< Pictures>

The man helping me, Edwin, was very patient and professional while helping me. However, when I was to pick my car up, I called for the Subaru shuttle to pick me up from my house.

No hassle and up front pricing given online by Cemal. The, sales associate Matt was both down to earth and very knowledgeable. As a first time Subaru customer both my fiancé were very satisfied and the entire experience from looking at inventory online, test driving in person and completing the sale itself was very pleasant and easy.</Text>

Horrendous experience. My car was in the shop for a mandatory safety recall on the airbag. Subaru was supposed to pay for my rental but never did. I was charged $180 by AVIS in 3 transactions up to a week after returning the vehicle. AVIS won’t tell my why they charged me or where I signed any document allowing them to do so. Stevens Creek Subaru told me the same thing had happened to 3 other customers in the same week, yet they refuse to do anything about it.

They also clearly adjusted the wiring or airflow in the engine but can’t explain how, why, or what they did. All I know is the gas pedal is suuuuper sensitive now.< /review>

<Text>"Unscrupulous sales guy at Steven creek Subaru service department" Recently, my son took my 2008 Subaru Impreza for a regular service to this place. He recently graduated from school and didn't now much about cars. The service advisor, Jonathan Starrett took complete advantage my son and charged close to $1000 for a regular maintenance.

<review>Finance department lied to get a lease done. If you're doing anything out of the ordinary with your car, i.e. traveling, then DO NOT lease from these folks, or at least do your own research and DO NOT trust a word they say. Sales team was great.

UPDATE: Brian contacted me and is making efforts to remedy the situation.

UPDATE 2: Brian Bakhtiari did everything to make this situation right. He agreed we were in an unfortunate situation and put us, the customer, first. I give him a full FIVE STARS. I will be reaching out to the owner of the dealership to inform them of Brian's customer service.

I kept the overall review at four stars since the situation was entirely avoidable if not for the lies of some of the other staff members. Furthermore, Subaru of America was less than helpful. They acknowledged that they "felt bad" for the situation, but couldn't do anything, which is hard for me to believe. Their "apology" wasn't solving my $20,000 problem that was created by their own employees. Such a lack of accountability is disappointing. For transparency, they paid for half of the shipping costs that I had to pay out of my own pocket to send the car back to Stevens Creek. It's a far cry from stellar customer service though.

tl;dr - Stevens Creek Subaru has an excellent GM - Brian Bakhtiari. The other staff created some unnecessary problems that they wanted to ignore. Subaru of America also ignored these problems, only offering apologies.< /review>< Time>

Payman helped me find the right lease plan for me. And both Payman and Cemal made my experience memorable and speedy! In 2.5 hours I was out the door and completely up to speed on what the dealership and car could offer me. While I understand that this approach may not be for everyone, I knew exactly what I was looking for in a car and the price range I was willing to pay so the efficiency was a perfect fit for me!< /text>

The deciding factors for me were the price of the new vehicle after trade in of my truck, and the amount of hassle I might get in arriving at the right price. My salesperson, Katrin, was very good at keeping the hassle to an acceptable minimum, making my car buying experience a pleasant one.

<Review>We bought a 2016 Outback in march of 2016. Sales presentation  of safety electronics was very good but reality is different the GPS sends you to wrong places, it tells you to make a U-turn in middle of the free way, it may make you go around and around the same streets for a while.
The voice recognition  SYSTEM MAY WORK  if you drive below 20 miles.
in general if you have to buy a Subaru buy one without any electronics upgrade.
Now you call Stevens Creek Subaru service department be prepared to stay on line and wait for 10 minutes or more before someone comes on line and  tells you these are not Subaru problems they are other provider issues.  I tried to make an appointment on may 28 the earliest time they could see the car was June 14th.  I left the service department a note to call me on 5-27-2016 in the morning and did not receive a call back. over all it was a mistake to buy a Subaru.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1469641906535, 'text': 'Sassan- Thank you for your feedback, it is very important to us.

I stopped into Stevens Creek Subaru to check out the new 2015 WRX on display. Not only was I impressed with the new body style and features, but I was equally impressed by the staff. Everyone from the receptionist to the managers were very interactive and friendly. As a Subaru enthusiast myself, I was entertained by the well roundedness of the product knowledge of the employees. It was a very comfortable environment and I look forward to returning for potential future business when the 2015 model officially launches.< /Review>

<Text>Went here on Friday 1.6.17, had the worst experience. Hossein "helped" us. Not only is he rude, he is also pushy. Just trying to "make that sale". Miserable experience and when we tried to get the key back for my car, the guys in the back and him wouldn't give it up until we said that we weren't interested anymore. Would not recommend. Went to Fairfield Subaru the next day and got the exactly opposite experience. If you are willing to drive, it's worth the distance then coming to Stevens creek Subaru.</Text>< pictures>

<review>On Saturday 05/07 I visited This location for Outback, I talked to a guy Taz he showed us car and test Drive, every thing was perfect and we were almost ready to buy car on same day, There was price negotiation going on, all of sudden one of his manger/boss jumped in discussion, He was such a rude and arrogant person, he spoiled all conversation. We got so upset because of his behavior that we just walked from there without buying car.

They must be having couple good and humble person but having few rubbish fish can spoil any deal, at least it happened in my case.<//review><resp>None</resp><UserId.>103922090126928217525< /UserId.><pics>None</pics><Rate>1<//Rate><name>Narendra Singh< /name><Gmap_id>0x808fcae131970085:0x2830ab4a74e22c3b<//Gmap_id>< Date>

I came to Subaru knowing exactly what I wanted. I went to other dealerships that did not take me seriously (Cypress Subaru in Seaside and Capitol Subaru). A couple of minutes after walking into Stevens Creek I found the Crosstrek I was searching for and was greeted by a wonderful salesperson ... Manny!

We went for a test drive, negotiated, and was even offered a nice cold bottled water as soon as we went inside.  As the financing was being looked over Manny even brought us Arby's!

The negotiating process was made easy with the help of Manny who answered our questions and took charge of our request (we were very specific).  Once his manager Andreas came over to meet us we made our decision. We knew what we wanted, knew what price we wanted to pay and they made it happen for us.

That said, this was my first car purchase and I am happy that Manny, Andreas and even the Finance manager was there to make it easy, painless and straight forward ... even though it was AFTER closing.

I am happy and will refer friends in the future to Stevens Creek Subaru.</text>

< review>
Sold me a car with 2 unfixed recalls and were unresponsive to my emails. This includes an unfixed airbag recall which is just scary. I am going to another Subaru dealer for the service as I do not trust them.< /review>

Arrived for a 30 min service appointment scheduled ahead of time. Was told it would take at least 2.5 hours (to perform an oil change and tire rotation) because "we couldn't help it that all these people showed up" (there was a long line of cars at the overcrowded service entrance spilling out into the street). If you allow people to make an appointment, make sure you can service them in time. Or at least mention that it will take "at least 2 hours, unless you are here first thing in the morning" when people sign up for a 30 min window.<//text>

< Review>
It started off rocky but it turned out alright. Initially I was not treated well, but after I talked to the general manager Brian, and the assistant Gary, they really turned around my opinion of them.

They have worked really hard to help me solve the issues with my car. My engine was blown after a faulty oil change by another company. After initial trouble getting the oil company to cover it, Gary was awesome with the support and help to get my wife and I through this. I will be going to this dealership for all of my future service.

It didn't start well, but thank you for treating me with decency and respect in the end. It's not how you start, but how you finish that matters. Thank you.< /Review>

Having own 4 Subaru in the past and currently we have a Forester. I am surprised as there is no recall on Subaru's headlights problems.  All four of ours, the headlights burned within 2 years.  At this particular location repair center, we we're charged $200+, then within a week the other side of the headlight burned. We were then told that it's more likely that it happened. So disappointed.< /text>

I came here for a servicing for a recall on my subaru. I had an appointment, took off work early, arrived to the servicing location on time and waited an hour before a rep spoke to me. On top of that they didn't have the program for my recall. So all that for nothing!<//Text>

<time>1515985854857<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>My son's 2005 Mazda stopped working on Christmas Eve, four hours away between his college and home. We decided to find a safe and reliable car, and after considering a variety of cars, the Subaru Crosstrek quickly became our top pick. The model and price we were targeting was found at Stevens Creek Subaru.

Shane Amirkiai was our sales person, and he is a rockstar! The person who we were originally going to work with was sick, so Shane came in on his day off to help us. Shane made us feel completely at ease. It was like a friend was helping us, not some pushy salesman. Shane provided thorough answers to our questions. The whole process, including the visit with the finance manager, took about three hours.

If we decide to purchase another Subaru, we will absolutely make the drive to Stevens Creek Subaru - all the way from Petaluma!< /review>< pictures>

They lied and lied and lied. When I thought the lies were done, they managed to come back with more. The trade in value of a car, the service coverage in other parts of the state, the loan information. I would never recommend this dealership to anyone. Go somewhere else.< /review>

I bought a new car from them a year ago. I had to call them for warranty repair recently - they told me to wait for a month for appointment. On a question what should I do with a broken car for a month they recommended me calling another dealer. Will do so gladly, Stevens Creek Subaru disappointed me a lot this time around.</text>

Let me start by saying that my wife and I have leased our vehicles for more than 20 years now. In that time we've leased from Audi, Nissan, Infiniti, Ford, VW, Chevy, Toyota, and now Subaru. This was by far the best experience we have ever had leasing/buying a car.  We were contacted by their internet specialist, Frank Homayoun, soon after our inquiry on their website. Frank quoted us an ePrice for the vehicle that we wanted that beat the competition. We did not have to haggle with the price. Their delivery service was exceptional. When we went in to fill out the paper work, Frank had the car ready and he got us out in less than an hour! When our lease is up for our other car we will be returning to Stevens Creek Subaru.<//text>

I am a Subaru ambassador, have worked with the company for about two years and have helped about a half dozen folks buy their own Subarus in addition to visiting maybe a dozen or so Subaru dealers. Compared to the competition (even in South Bay) there isn't a lot that Stevens Creek gets right.

Lot: Limited selection, you need to make an appointment to see a car in the configuration you want.

Availability: Even if it's slow, they'll give you a difficult time about walk-in availability. They'll only show you one car, and only in the configuration that's already on the lot. They want to get your information and push you out quickly so that they can get another person in the door. Doesn't matter if you're interested in buying soon, unless you want to buy that day they're not giving you their time.

Service: Service area is very very small. Otherwise it was acceptable, they had wifi, water, some coffee.

Pricing: They will only show you MSRP pricing unless you enter into a serious discussion, they'll try to not provide you with a quote so you don't shop it around to other dealers. Somewhat astonishing compared to every other dealer I've been at.

Salesmanship: Very transactional, not personal. I don't think my salesman told me his name over the hour we spent together. Provided very little information about the vehicle I was test driving other than telling me what I already knew after I would say it, or things very related to what I already knew. They just want your contact information so they can send you mail and email.

Test Drive: This is a big no/no for me, and probably the reason for at least 1.5 stars being deducted. Very very very limited ability to test drive. They'll tell you where to go, it's only on very very nearby roads. They try to make the ride as short as possible so other people can test drive the car. There will be no variations in the drive based on what they know you're interested in. For example: no highway, no parking lot turning radius checks, no differential check (going up a driveway straight on vs at an angle to check for body roll), no time to test the infotainment screen, no ability to test cabin noise at different speeds or on different ground types, no ability to test on speedbumps.

Outcome:
Other than the above, they are reasonably polite, just clearly focused on making their sales. Do yourself a favor and head over to Putnam, Fremont, etc. and shop around a little bit. I would return here for service,  definitely would not buy a car here.

Just a note to Management:
This place strikes me as a place that has run amock in metrics. Namely, Amount of new leads produced, amount of leads closed, highest average cost per sale, amount of walk-ins turned into leads or closed sales, amount of emails sent, amount of calls made, etc. You've forgotten your job is to sell cars that people love, not hit metrics. You're more like a Ford than a Subaru dealer, and you don't align at all with the brand.<//Review>

< Review>
I recently purchased a Suburu Forrester from Aydin at Stevens Creek Subaru, before we made our purchase, Aydin was very responsive over the phone and email.
When it came time to work the numbers, I told him I was under time pressure and that I was not interested in a long and drawn out negotiation.  He understood and we landed on a price we both agreed to and made the paperwork smooth and quick as possible.

When we were ready to take delivery of the car, it was in perfect condition, and Aydin took his time to explain all the functions and features that came with the car, furthermore Aydin scheduled a complimentary orientations with a product specialist.
When I had trouble with some settings a few days later, he got back to me right away and was able to explain to me how things worked.

It was a great car buying experience and I strongly recommend working with Aydin!< /Review>

I had been thinking I need to look for another car... we always had Subaru growing up and I know they are supposed to last a long time so I went over the stevens Creek Subaru, although I really didn't want to because I just didn't even want to deal with getting a new car because of all the BS that goes with the whole process. ....we walked in and were approached by this guy named Hamid, he asked us what we needed for in  a new car and showed us which car seemed to best suit our needs. We go to the mountains often so new we should have an AWD that gets really good mileage so he showed us the Forester and he showed us all the different options we could get. Hamid seems very helpful to help you get what you need and not pushy so I am sure that we will go back in there soon and ask for Hamid when we're ready to get the car</text>

Do not ever go there for their used car. It's a trap. I brought car from them and they told me the car was completely examined and had done the maintenance,  but actually not. I know this because after three months, the timing belt broke and the engine was broke as well. The auto repair told me the timing belt was too old and this car hadn't done any completely maintenance. They lied to me</review>

First of all I would like to thank Fred Mir (Freddy) for all the time and effort he put in to help me and my husband pick the right car. He was very informative, had a lot of knowledge about Subaru's, and a very good sense of humor. My husband and I knew we wanted a subaru, but we weren't sure which model was a perfect fit for us. After test driving the cross track and Forster, Freddy suggested to give the out back a try. Even though I wasn't a big fan of the outbacks after test driving one, it changed my mind. Next part was negotiation. He helped us get the price we wanted, and he made sure we don't spend the rest of our day there since we had dinner reservation. If I end up getting a forester for my daughter I would definitely go back to Freddy, because he knows how to treat a customer well.< /review>

We went to Stevens Creek Subaru just to look at our options (we were trying to decide between the Toyota Rav 4 and the Subaru Forester).  We had a price in mind and were trading in an 07 Toyota.  Our one other experience buying a car a few years ago from somewhere else was not pleasant, but Chip at Subaru made this experience very painless.  We did not feel we were pressured into anything, such as buying extras, and the whole experience (with test driving and general looking around the lot) only took a couple hours.  Some people might think that is a long time but based on my previous experience, it is actually pretty short.  Chip was able to get us the price we wanted and seemed to do everything very promptly.  Instead of us waiting for him it turned out to be the other way around.  He's also called us multiple times since then to see if we have any questions.  Overall, we are very satisfied with the way everything has gone!< /review>

<review>Subaru sent me a recall saying that the passenger airbag was deadly and that no one should ride in the front seat.  It took me a year to get an appointment for fixing this recall.  They offered a rental car for the interim, but could not provide something of comparable size and with all wheel drive (necessary for safety in snow) or provide vehicle storage (necessary in the Bay Area). When I did get an appointment I was told by the receptionist (Nikki Ramirez sic) that my recall repairs would only take two hours on my appointment date.  When I arrived for my appointment they told me that the repairs would take three to five days!!  I have not been able to reach anyone at the dealer for two days.  A phone message says that their phone lines are down and that I should try email or chat.  They have not responded to email or chat!  Dealer service is expensive and is this case extremely poor.<//review>< resp>

TERRIBLE customer service. Saved up for a year and half, spec'ed out the car of my dreams. I just wanted to test drive it before pulling the trigger and buying it. Went  there, and the salesman said I couldn't test drive it until I bought it because "people who buy this car know it already". I couldn't believe it. DON'T GO HERE<//text>

Visiting the Stevens Creek Subaru showroom, looking at the different models, taking a demo ride, learning more about all of the functions,  selecting and buying the model and options was an extremely pleasant and satisfying experience.  I particularly enjoyed working with Kat (the saleslady), Wais (the finance wizard) and Shaun (the "Tech Guy") who were all extremely knowledgeable, polite, professional and friendly.  I also found that negotiating the final price was pleasant and satisafying and not at all threatening.  The whole organization appear to be a great team and the product, a 2014 Subaru Forster, sold itself.  I highly recommend Stevens Creek Subaru as "the place" to buy your nexr car.</Text>

<review>I bought an Impreza here on Sept. 8th for the price I wanted, with the options I wanted (plus one - all weather floor mats) which I had not included on the original request.  The sale went through Matt Kanawyer, the Internet Sales Manager.  I had been dealing with another dealership who wouldn't give me the price I wanted.  Matt agreed to match a price I had gotten from a dealership quite a bit farther away.  My wife and me have bought a number of cars over the years.  My wife walked out saying this was the best buying experience she ever had.  I have to agree.  There was no pressure about anything.  No sales tactics.  Just service.  We got in and out very quickly.  I would be happy to do business with Matt again when we buy our next car.</review>< pictures>

<Text>On 07/19/2013  we purchased our brand new 2013 Outback Limited from Stevens Creek Subaru in San Jose, as a result of the great pricing and professional courtesy offered to us by Shane Amirkiai, Internet Sales Associate. I highly recommend Shane as your contact person at this dealership if you are considering a Subaru purchase. His ORIGINAL offer was by far the BEST offer we received online and I had researched dealerships extensively before this purchase. He called me to answer my questions on his day off, he promised to be there when we arrived from 2 hours away and he was there waiting for us upon our arrival. If I contacted him online, his reply was always prompt and never pushy. He knew this Subaru vehicle from its engine to the navigation system and even encouraged us to call him if questions arose once we
were home.
As a result of his utter transparency and honesty in quoting us this outstanding offer, it made completion of the vehicle paperwork effortless. This is how car purchases should be done.
Subaru is a great vehicle, the car actually sells itself is you are looking for a AWD vehicle, and this dealership, with the expert attention given to us by Shane Amirkiai, made our car buying experience the best. It was a FIVE STAR experience for us!

I bought an Outback from Marty at Stevens Creek Subaru.

He gave me a great price (so low that other dealerships wouldn't match it), quick delivery, and helpful explanations about things that are unique to Subarus, like the need to rotate tires frequently because of the AWD.  No sales pressure or monkey business -- not from Marty, not from any managers, and not from the finance guys.  Marty even picked me up at SJC after I returned my rental car.

It was a pleasure working with Marty and I recommend him.< /review>

I went in looking get more information and test drive a STI and a BRZ. I'm a younger guy so I know they will be skeptical.  The past week I have visited almost every dealer in the area and test drove something that interests me without a problem. I have been doing this because I want to make an informed decision before purchasing a vehicle. Unfortunately the sale rep made an assumption about my ability to afford the car and demanded I fill out a credit application before test driving. I tried to explain to him that if their car stood up to the competition I'd be happy to fill one out after the test drive. It was a real shame because I've had my eye on an STI for some time now, however I'm not willing to take an unnecessary hit against my credit if it turns out the car isn't what I expected. Id recommend going down the street to Ford. They seem to treat their customers with respect there.<//Text>

< review>
We had a great experience at Stevens Creek Subaru. Our salesperson, Gurpreet, was awesome. He was very transparent and thorough about the buying process. We definitely asked a lot of questions and test drove several cars, several times. He was very patient and responsive throughout, and never pressured or steered us at any time. And, we could have walked away with enough information to shop elsewhere. But, we really appreciated his sales approach, and it was a big factor in why we decided to come back and buy from him.

When we were handed off to Ali (financing) to sign the paperwork on our new Forester, it was a smooth transition. He was calm, patient and very thorough as well. He made sure that we understood everything we were offered, that it was the correct offer (prices, options, etc.), and we understood every document we were about to sign (there are a lot).

Often when you're getting ready to sign paperwork, you're prepared to get hit with all the add-ons (added trim, etc.) and upselling. Ali didn't do that at all (neither did Gurpreet). He offered us the service contract, gap insurance, and warranty which were all practical over the life of the car. No more, no less. It was a relief.

Even though it was the end of the day, there was no rush what so ever. For us, it was a big decision to purchase and we felt like we were in good hands. We felt like both Gupreet and Ali had our best interest at heart and we feel like we made a good decision about the car we bought. Thank you both!<//review>

<Review>Roy Almeyda was the internet sales manager that assisted us.  He was very nice and easy to deal with.  He answered our questions and we felt no pressure.   When we went to purchase the vehicle, he was out sick with a toothache unfortunately.  Payman Shauni stepped up and offered us great service by offering speedy service and getting our vehicle ready.  He was very kind and professional.   First class salesmen for both of them.< /Review>< pics>

Both Homayoun ("Ben") and Bijan provided exceptionally service and were extremely helpful.  They were easily able to answer all of my questions.  Going through the process with Ben made the entire experience of buying a new car much more enjoyable and way less stressful than I had expected it would be.  Bijan also was very helpful with all of the forms and financial side.  Both Ben and Bijan have been very attentive to my concerns since purchasing the vehicle and have continued to provide top quality service.   Thanks guys!< /Review>

< Review>
Buying an Impreza was the easiest and most straight-forwared car-buying experience. I have had, ever. I requested a quote online, and my sales  guy, Shane, honored the quote. No surprises, no add-ons, no bait and switch. He actually emailed the VIN for the car. It  was an easy and efficient. Before I Ieft,  he explained and demonstrated all of the safety features, connected my cell phone, and helped me  feel comfortable with driving a car packed with useful and fun equipment.< /Review>

<Text>This was the worst dealership I have been to. It took 15+ minutes before someone actually came up to us to ask if we need help. Needless to say, there were 3 salespeople standing 5 feet from us just chatting it up. Once, we did get help, we were told the vehicle we drove 130 miles to see had been sold earlier in the day. Keep in mind that we verified the car was available with Roy before driving there. So, their solution was to attempt to sell us a more expensive vehicle. We decided to stay and take a look at it, which was another mistake. They don’t keep all their vehicles on that lot. The guy helping us had to go to their lot by Barnes and Noble. This lot is only a 5 minute drive or 12 minute walk from Stevens Creek location. He did not return for 45+ minutes. At that point, we decided to go outside and wait for him. Once the guy helping us arrived, he went straight inside without looking for us. We spent about 30 minutes looking at the inside and outside of the vehicle never once being approached to see if we need help or were being helped. The guy helping us had our number. However, never attempted to call to see where we were or if still interested. This dealership had poor business practice. If possible, do not waste your time and spend your money here. Attempt to find a different Subaru dealership that will treat you with respect and actually make you feel like they are serious about selling you a vehicle. Another word of advice, do not trust any quote Roy sends you via email specially if you are traveling to see that specific package for that price. Even though, Stevens Creek Subaru lost a sell through us, I hope they clean up their business practice through reading this to better serve and treat other customers with respect. Do not waste people’s time. Good luck to all who decide to go here.

In addition, the below response from Brian is just to make it seem like the dealership cares to improve customer experience. I have emailed Brian with no response. It is only a business tactic. While I understand most dealerships are the same. The good ones will maintain a level of respect and professionalism.

If you are looking to buy, go to Maita Subaru in Sacramento. That is where I made my purchase. Toney made me a respectable deal on 2018 Premium Outback with Eyesight.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I have been shopping around for a car for 3 months now, and have dealt with a lot of sales people that were inconsistent about their brand and very pushy. And being a female trying to purchase a vehicle doesn't help the situation either. However, when I met Katrin Bassenger at Stevens Creek Subaru, I immediately felt comfortable with her. She answered all my questions from A to Z, everything from the sales to the finance process. I recommend going to Katrin if you are in the market for buying a car, because I can promise you that she will help you out within your first and only visit!!!< /Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>The staff I encountered at Stevens Creek Subaru were all very friendly and personable people. The experience there was casual and no pressure. I walked in without an appointment. I was greeted by Homayoun "Ben" Ebrahimi who was kind and attentive to my interests and setting up a test drive. "Ben" was very helpful with answering my questions and getting an idea of what I was looking for in a car. I was probably an easy customer because what I was looking for was rather laser focused. By the end of the test drive I was offered below MSRP deal and said I would sleep on it. There was no pressure with my decision which added to my confidence with the experience. I returned the next day with the decision to move forward with financing a new car. As we were working through all of the paperwork we chatted with the staff and learned with enthusiasm how they enjoyed working at the dealership. Overall my experience was excellent and would recommend this dealership.<//text>< userid>

<Text>This was my first shopping and buying experience with Subaru Stevens Creek. I was very impressed and satisfied with the work of this dealership. First of all, I liked the responses of the internet sales manager Andreas, who provided the quote with good price and was quickly and informatively answering all my questions regarding the options and the trim via emails. Later when we got to the dealership, we were met by one of the client advisors Homayoun "Ben", who was helpful during all the process. He was very knowledgable, answering every question we asked and providing information that we requested. I received positive decision about the financing in half an hour and quickly finished the paperwork. By the end, I went out with the keys of my new Subaru Impreza 2017 Premium hatchback and I like it very much. The whole process took around 2-3 hours. Thank you Subaru Stevens Creek team.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Writing this hoping the salespeople read this.

I had come with intentions of looking at their inventory and hoping of test driving the WRX.
I spent a good 20 minutes looking around and just getting a feel for the cars. I asked to speak to a sales associate and told him I was interested in an STI and asked for a test drive. He said no problem, he'll get us all set up.
20-30 minutes go by and the guy disappears and me and my mother were dumbfounded by the unprofessionalism we just experienced.
After awhile we were able to speak to someone else who then told us we cannot test drive the WRX or the STI as they are sports cars and are worried about people just driving them for a joy ride, which is bullshit if I'm willing to put 13,000 down on a car, I should be able to test drive it to make sure I enjoy the ride.
From a sales point of view I understand why they need to take precautions but overall it was a meh experience.< /review>< Pics>

<userid>111353162044434780642</userid><text>I bought my 2005 Subaru Outback xt here and 3000 miles later I am in the hole for the car's value in repairs.  I went to get my 105k maintenance at a different, reputable Subaru location and they found that there were problems with:

- Up pipe
- Radiator
- Intercooler
- Timing Belt
- Oil Lines
- Turbo
- Oil Pan

Many of these would have been noticed if Stevens Creek Subaru decided to check their cars before selling, but they don't seem to care about the cars they sell once they are out of their doors.  There is debris from the previous owner's turbo blowing which caused my engine to be compromised.  Do not give these people your business they will screw you over.

EDIT:

After spending 10 minutes on hold with "Ron" (Stevens creek's general phone number) I have come to the conclusion that they only want to seem like they are customer oriented.

Ron, if you are a real person, please do not give a generic phone number and waste people's time who are already upset with the service they have received.  I understand that if you gave a personal phone number, your phone would probably constantly be ringing, but if you aren't going to back up an offer to help, then why even offer?  I really wish we could have sorted something out, but it seems like Steven's Creek will laugh to the bank with my money.</text><resp>{'time': 1500934242031, 'text': 'Michael- I am very concerned by your review and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss and resolve the issue as soon as possible.

<Text>For any young car-buyers or anyone interested in the STI...

The incident happened back in September, 2015, when I was in the market for a car in the 30~40k range and wanted to test drive the STI. Before coming to the dealership, I called ahead to make sure they have the configuration I wanted and was promised a test drive. By this time, I had already test driven the 370z ('15), the Mustang GT ('15), and even a Boss Mustang ('12), so I didn't give it a second thought before driving to the dealership...

I was 25, Taiwanese American, and worked as an engineer making 100k/yr at a tech startup. When the salesperson who greeted me found out that I was there to test drive the STI, he said he had to go talk to his managers to get an approval. He came back to me five minutes later, asking what car I drove, to which I responded "2003 VW GTI". The salesperson went back to the manager and related this information, only to come back with "sorry, we don't let people test drive the STI". When I confronted him with the promise made to me over the phone, he returned with "based on the current car owned by our customer, we can tell whether they are sincerely looking to purchase certain vehicles", and that "the STI's are such a rare sports car that we cannot let people put unnecessary miles on them". That was when I realized what was going on... I was being profiled as some teenager with no money and no intention of buying anything, looking for a free joy ride.

It was deeply insulting to be discriminated against, and incredibly shortsighted of the dealership, especially considering its location in the Silicon Valley. When I offered to prove my capability to pay for the STI fully in cash, I was still denied the test drive.

I strongly urge young car-buyers and people shopping for the STI to avoid this Subaru dealership and take their business elsewhere. When I bought a Focus ST after 2 months of car-shopping, this was the ONLY unpleasant incident I'd had with dealerships across the Peninsula.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1472146516237, 'text': "Waylon, I'm discouraged to hear you drove away with a dissatisfying experience at our dealership.

Still have not received my car or call backs about my car. I just put my car in before the Christmas weekend  Dec 23,15 for diagnostic. I was stated that I would get a call back next day about all the testing and what is wrong, never got a call back. I figured it was holiday week to cut some slack. Waited 3 days and called on Saturday, due to no call back. Then stated my service advisor was not in on Saturday Dec 26,15 and to call back Monday. Called back Monday Dec 28th, and was stated I need to change parts, which they have on HAND and it should be done by Weds Dec 30th. Waited till Weds and call backs, nothing. Left another message for Service advisor which still did not get back to me. Took time out of my day to drive to Stevens Creek Subaru the following Saturday Jan 2nd, 2016 and was stated that they were missing a part to change the clutch assembly and it won't come in until Mon. Jan 4th, and since the tech is on vacation Mon, it won't be repaired till Tues Jan 5th, 2016.
Called today Jan 4th just to see if things are in order and if we are on track so I can get my car back.
Was stated I would get a call back from my service advisor. (I am not putting the name of my service advisor down, because although I am very upset by not getting my call backs and status on my car, I do not want anyone to get into trouble) I just want this issue to be known by Subaru that keeping customer's in the dark about there car is very nerve racking. Borrowing cars from Family members and basically asking friends to plan ahead to take me to the dealership is not easy when you have a toddler running around. Just follow ups and actual customer service, a quick call about status on my car is all I wanted. If the car is gonna take a week it's fine. If the car takes two weeks or a month that's fine too, just don't make me chase and call in waiting for a call back and info on my car telling me it would be done this day, and I call in and then actually come to the shop and get the answer face to face vs. just a call.

At this point still no status if the part came in, and if the car is still on track to get on the expected date.<//review>

<review>This was my first time purchasing a new car, so I was very nervous about the whole car shopping experience. I had done my research before and went into Stevens Creek Subaru to just check out a car that I was interested in. I left that day with a brand new car, and a new appreciation for car salesmen. Cemal Unal helped me feel comfortable about the whole car buying experience. He's an enthusiastic guy that really takes cares of his customers. He explained everything very thoroughly and did not pressure me into anything that I did not want. I asked for his advice on a lot of smaller things because he was very upfront with me. He did not try and influence to buy this or add-on that.
After the purchase of my new car, he's still keeping in touch with me to make sure that everything is okay with my new car.
I would definitely recommend Cemal Unal at Stevens Creek Subaru for all of your Subaru car needs!<//review>< gmapID>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>If you are thinking of buying from Steven's Creek Subaru, please read this review first! MY SALES CONTRACT WAS MESSED UP TWICE AND I RECEIVED A THREATENING PHONE CALL FROM AN EMPLOYEE NAME MOHAMMED. I would hate for more customers to have the same experience I did!

While I love my Forester, I truly regret buying it from Steven's Creek Subaru. Not only did they mess up on our sales contract TWICE, but I also received an EXTREMELY HARASSING phone call from an employee named Mohammed (I am not sure of his last name. I asked, but his response, word for word, was "That's all you need to know" before he hung up on me). Here's the story behind it:

When Chase (the bank that Steven's Creek Subaru finances through) was not paying the dealership due to the errors that they made in the contract (twice...), Mohammed call me and accused me of not making my payments (of which I had already paid two). I tried to give him any information from the online payment portal to prove that I was making payments (not that I should have to do this anyway), but he did not believe me. So, Mohammed said that I needed to pay the dealership directly. Obviously, I knew that my only obligation was to make my payments to Chase, so I told him that I would absolutely not. Then, he tried to get me to call Chase to figure out the problem, which is absolutely not my responsibility, so I said no. His last resort was to threaten to cancel my contract and take my car back (both ridiculous and empty threats). At this point, I asked for his name because I felt threatened by the way he was raising his voice at me. That is when Mohammed refused to tell me his last name and hung up on me.

This conversation left me so insulted, infuriated, and shaken that I was literally in tears. I have NEVER been spoken to by anyone like that in my life. And to be treated this way for a mistake that Steven's Creek Subaru had made was absolutely ridiculous.

To be honest, I feel that Mohammed spoke down to be because I am a woman. I felt patronized by the way he spoke to me and I believe he was trying to bully me into paying them. I truly believe that he thought he could take advantage of me because I am a woman and young, but his stupid attempts failed.

After this incident, I spoke over the phone to RJ, a sales manager, who only offered what could barely pass for an apology and absolutely no explanation for why Mohammed would call me and harass me in such a way. I also called Brian Bakhtiari, the head sales manager, and left a message. He could not even be bothered to call me back.

This is the second car we have bought from Steven's Creek Subaru. I have always taken my car to get every service at their dealership as well. I was clearly a loyal customer, but if this is how they treat their "valued customers" I would hate to see how they are treating everyone else...

Since all of my other attempts to get an explanation from Steven's Creek Subaru for Mohammed's rude and unacceptable actions and some sort of remediation did not work, I am hoping that this post will at least save someone else the headache and harassment that I went through. I will never return to Steven's Creek Subaru and will make sure all my friends and family do the same.<//text>< pictures>

Wais in the finance department was also polite, professional and efficient in processing my loan. He was very sensitive to the value of my time as well, using "dead" time (while paperwork was printing, while the car was being detailed) to take care of various other details, like having parts bring out the bike rack Shane helped me install.

I'm totally stoked on my new Subaru, and have nothing but good things to say about the buying experience. Thanks to everyone at Stevens Creek Subaru for your help!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>Test drives are only for people who already know they want the car.

In short: I was denied a test drive because I don't like gray cars.

I showed up at the dealership with the intention to drive a WRX and/or a WRX STI. I was greeted by a salesperson who was happy to get me the keys to fire up an STI. With the car idling, he then asked what I wanted to do and I asked if I could drive the car. He began to inform me that test drives of WRXs (and STIs) are limited to people that like the model, color, features, etc of the car and would consider buying it today. I replied honestly, saying that I was just interested in seeing how the new ('15) car differs from the old model ('14) and that I don't care for the color of the car (gray). Also, this car was used, had a floppy rear view mirror, a broken arm rest, and an unwarranted high price tag, so I definitely wouldn't be buying THIS one, but I kept that part to myself. He didn't budge on the test drive policy. I checked out a WRX, he maintained that this car too would not be available for me to test drive. It was also gray. Essentially, I've taken valuable time out of my day, stopping by this dealership on my commute how from work, only to learn about how the interiors of these cars looks and feel. I suppose I also learned that this Subaru dealership likes to pretend that even its faulty used cars are too good for test drives.

I feel the need to note that I rolled up in my '97 Camry commuter car, which I presume gave off the impression that I have no money. Well done, Stevens Creek Subaru. You saved a few miles on the car and earned some additional reputation points on the Web. Maybe if I pull up in my G35 I'll get a different treatment...

Side note: While I'm at at, I might as well warn potential buyers that there may be swirl marks on your new prospective car's paint. A while back, when looking at BRZs with my girlfriend, I noticed a new red BRZ with swirl marks shimmering in the reflection of the outside lighting at dusk.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

JAMAL (Cemal), my sales person, was great. Helpful, straightforward, and honest. He is willing to spend time with you and really test-drive the car.

This is my second car. Of course I did my homework before I got into the deaership. This saves time for everyone. I did I took advange of the cash incentives and great rate and got a great deal.

I highly recommend that contact JAMAL if you want to get a new car. HE is part of the reason I steered away from VW and Toyota and got a Subaru at the end. But of course I like the quality and the price of the car.

I hope your car shopping experience is as great as mine.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>We just arrived America and were not familiar how to buy a car. Kash, my sales person, helped us feel comfortable throughout the buying process. He answered our questions patiently and friendly. After the purchase of my car, he still helped us to make sure everything is okay. Besides, the finance manager Jason and other employees helped us to deal with the complicated transaction process patiently. We really love our new Outback. Congratulation for you having such excellent employees. I give 5++ stars to Kash Shirallie and will strongly recommend our friends buy Subaru from Kash through Stevens Creek Subaru.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcae131970085:0x2830ab4a74e22c3b</Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Unprofessional! They lack common communication skills between humans. They act like they pay the customers, not the opposite. I came to the store to get some information for a car, the salesman was chewing a gum while I was trying to talk to him. Disrespectful. He reminded me the acting of Al Pacino in Scarface.</Review>< userid>

< Review>
For personal reasons, I drove 6 hours to get to Stevens Creek Subaru and Shane Amirkiai.  I had been talking with Shane by email and phone for about 3 weeks and was finally able to get down to San Jose to work with Shane and sign the papers for my new XV Crosstrek.  It was sad to leave my 16-yo, 247,000-mi, Subaru Legacy Outback behind, having logged many fond memories of awesome adventures.  (Shane even took and emailed me a picture of this 3rd-time Subaru car owner standing between the old crone and the new baby.)  The upside was having the easeful and adventurous experience of buying my new Crosstrek with Shane's impeccable help.  He was patient, answered every question with knowledge and clear detail, and changed up gracefully each time I changed direction as we "created" the new car.  He never pushed or rushed me during the whole process, and four hours later I left Shane to begin my new adventure.  It's all about the LOVE – and I felt that with Shane's guidance and the nature of family at Stevens Creek Subaru!!<//Review>

I looked at other car makes and models, but I always went back to the Subaru Crosstrek. I did more research and found this is the car for me. When I came to Stevens Creek Subaru, it was the second dealership I went to and Ben was the one who offered me a test drive. From there, I became more interested in owning a Subaru Crosstrek. After taking a test drive and talking to Ben about my car needs and wants, he helped me fight for the price I wanted. He then spoke with the sales manager, Armen, about the price I was quoted from another dealership and thought it was a really low price for a lot of car. But Ben insisted and fought for me. When I went to Stevens Creek Subaru, I saw my car waiting for me by the lobby all ready to be handed to me, shiny and with a full tank of gas. Armen was busy closing deals with other customers but always came back with the assurance of me driving off with my gleaming new AWESOME car! With the help of Ben, Armen, RJ and Jason, I am now a proud owner of a Subaru XV Crosstrek Limited. I want to thank them for giving me the opportunity to get the car I want. I am enjoying my new Crosstrek. Did i mention it's all sorts of AWESOME? It is!</review><GmapID>0x808fcae131970085:0x2830ab4a74e22c3b<//GmapID></record>

Great Customer Service from the time you put your foot in their door. The sales person that helped me out was Katrin. She explained everything to me about the 2013 WRX Impreza. She was very knowledgeable about the car, and the test drive was very educational. She took her time and wan't rushing me whatsoever. Go to Katrin if you're looking for a honest sales person who wont waste your time!!!</review>

<review>I have been contemplating for a long time as to whether or not I should cash in my Honda Si for a Subaru STI and was a bit skeptical at first to make the change. When I finally bit the bullet, I was more than happy with my decision.

I conducted a lot of research prior to committing to purchasing the vehicle. I eventually ended up at the Stevens Creek Subaru dealership and was immediately assisted and approached by one of the salesman. I usually dislike going to car dealerships because I absolutely dislike how they bug you every second to try to talk you into buying a car. However, unlike most car salesmen that I have encountered who make you feel uncomfortable, are extremely pushy and make you feel like they are running some sort of shady business to rip you off, this salesman (named Cemal) who assisted me was extremely helpful, professional and courteous in helping me make a decision and evaluating my options prior to committing to buy. He seemed to be extremely educated about the vehicles and was fast and efficient during the whole process. I was pretty particular in the features I wanted on the car especially if I was going to throw down so much money on a new car so you can imagine all the questions I was inquiring about. The salesman, Cemal, was patient in wanting to help me find the car that is a good fit for my needs/wants and did not make me feel rushed. In fact, he actually shared a lot of his knowledge regarding the vehicle, that I did not know about which I found to be very helpful. I ended up sealing the deal and picked myself up a 2013 Impreza STI in black. Another one of the salesman (named Rocky) helped close the deal and also showed the same sense of professionalism and was also vey personable. This is probably the most comfortable car shopping experience I have had at a dealer lot.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this dealer lot if you are seriously considering buying a Subaru, or express an interest in getting one. Cemal even called me personally to follow-up to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase. I can't say you will get the same service with any other salesman, so make sure to request Cemal (pronounced Jamal) as your salesperson!!

Michael Marsh is an excellent sales personel who took the time (late into the evening) to listen to all my concerns and answer my numerous questions.  As a first time buyer, my experience with Michael was comforting and hassel-free, not to mention he gave me a "killer deal." I highly recommend talking with MIchael about / if purchasing a new vehicle from SC Subaru, for he is knowledged with the product line and creates a "kick-back" environment.

Thanks MIchael, my family and I LOVE our new "subie"<//text>

HE WILL TAKE YOU FROM A to Z.

<Text>Was looking for a imprezza and brz. They had only the showroom brz with a $4k markup. Wouldn't even let me test drive it since I was not planning on buying it today. I got to try the imprezza but the car sales man was very reluctant to help me out. Didn't buy a car from them and I wouldn't.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
Horrible experience.  Said they would come pick me up at the whole foods 2.5 miles away when I called to see if my car was ready.  They said yes but failed to tell me it would be in 2.5 hours.  Took uber.  Also tried to not deliver on warranty by suggesting I had taken car to a jiffy lube which I had not and they had no reason to suspect I had.<//Review>

Unbelievable bad service. Made appointment and let us came one day later. One day later adviser avoided to meeting us and let us come the other day. The problem was tiny, it was about auto light sensor, but adviser there insisted there was no auto light function in all Subaru cars and let us go away.</text>

This review is for Tyler in the service department of Steven’s Creek Subaru. I was a little wary of bringing my car in for service after all the horror stories I’ve heard over the years.

Tyler went above and beyond to not only explain everything they would be doing to my car, but explaining how much everything would cost. He also made sure to get me a nice loaner car for me to use, which saved my skin on my anniversary weekend.

When my car was finished being repaired, Tyler called me to explain exactly what they fixed in detail!

Thanks for being awesome Tyler, please give this man a raise!!<//Text>
