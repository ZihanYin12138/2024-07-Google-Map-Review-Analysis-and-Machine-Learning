<Text>We had an idea for mini cupcakes for my sister's baby shower. We were going to have a dessert bar and we heard lady di's had great cupcakes. My sister called them to place the order and all I had to do was stop by and pay. She told me she called and they said they were able to do the order so I rushed after work to pay and when I got there they changed their minds and told me they couldn't place the order. I needed the cupcakes for the next day so I was confused on why they said they could over the phone and when I got there they said no. They didn't give me an explanation and just took the person behind me. I was shocked. I didn't know what to do but I called kupcake kitchen and they said they would gladly do the order and even took my payment over the phone. We got the cupcakes the next day as planned and they were a hit. They were super friendly and I have never gone back to lady di's. They were very rude and unprofessional.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1616700092402, 'text': "Hi Janet,\nSorry to hear you had a bad experience. As far as the mini cupcakes, we do have them however they are custom order and requires 2-3 days in advance. There was no order placed in order for you to come and pay. I believe there was a miscommunication between our employee and your sister. She asked if we can make mini cupcakes and our employee said yes we do and  its a custom order  but we do have regular cupcakes in store . We never take mini cupcake order for the next day ,  it should be 2-3 days in advance and all of our employees know that . We do take payments over the phone all the time for the last 15 years so taking a payment over the phone was not an  issue.\nWe are glad you found another bakery that was able to complete your last minute order. Again Sorry for inconvenience and misunderstanding.\nLady Di's"}< /Response>< gmapID>

Absolutely love the variety.  My favorite is the chocolate dream cupcake (butter cream chocolate  icing) and the walnut brownie.  Always greeted warmly and my goods are always packaged with care. 👍🏾<//text>

When sales people come to visit at work they tend to bring Lady Di's cookies - it is such a happy treat for the lab! Finally got the chance to visit the place myself... and it did not disappoint.

Location wise - not hard to find and along the old road. Small store, not much but a display and cashier. Parking was fine it's a big plaza so there's bound to be a spot for you.

Service was friendly and quick... they had tons of options and it was already 4 in the afternoon...

I needed some dessert for my GodMothers birthday - didn't think I needed that many so I got 1/2 a dozen of cupcakes and 1/2 dozen cookies. cookies here are delicious! Oreo crave is my go to but my absolute favorite has to be the oatmeal chocolate chip. Their cookies are $1.50 each but they're pretty big so the price makes sense. Their cupcakes were delicious as well and their were some fun flavors I definitely had to try... banana cream pie was good. Wasn't too sweet so I enjoyed it a lot. They had a blueberry lemon and I thought it was pretty good... I didn't think their cupcakes were overwhelming, so they were a perfect purchase for a group of older folk not looking for some something TOO sweet. They were $3 per cupcake which is pretty standard at a shop like this.

Didn't mind the price and would come back here again.< /Text>

There is Always tomorrow<//user_name>
<Text>Just received cookies as a gift to our office in N.J. and since I opened the very well packed and marked box I was skeptical since the company is in California (west coast) and we are literally on the other side (east coast). I thought maybe the distance and travel would damage or reduce the quality. You never know. I was so surprised that it was so well packed not one cookie was even broken. I swiped the chocolate chip cookie and It is so good I wish I had milk to dip it in. It’s like my mom made cookies and sent them to school with me, tastes so good and home made and brought me back to being a kid with her prize big ol’ chocolate chip cookie. More please!< /Text><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

<text>These are the best cookies anywhere. I'm a really cookie connoisseur, and I've never tasted better. I'm always strictly a chocolate guy! But the oatmeal raisin cookies here are just incredible. The chocolate don't disappoint either. Love the peanut butter chocolate ones and the plain old semi sweet. Plus the brownies are incredible. Dense. Moist. Mushy. Yummy. Plus they have a peanut butter brownie. So good. I've yet to find cookies that are better, and when I've shared them, I haven't found anyone who disagrees with me.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c28734dc3996cf:0x87bbbf43428156f5</gmap_id></record>

Here it is Mother's Day and my plan to take my mother on a nice drive, in my convertiable, from Porter Ranch to Santa Paula, only to find out the place we were going for coffee and beignets closed at 2:00.  In an attempt to have coffee in some other place than a corporate chain, I started letting my fingers do the walking.  I tripped upon this bakery, called to make sure we could get coffee and a place to sit and off we went.  What a wonderful surprise.  ALL of the cupcakes  (8 tried in all, cuz we took some to go), were sinfully decedent.  Absolutely delicious. No favorite to recommend as they were all incredible.</text>

It was the superest thing ever brah. These cookies were so amazing I moved right down the street from the store all the way from Japan.

<review>Skate/Scooter park is fantastic. $5 for 2 hours and you and/or your kid can shred it up  inside a large outdoor skate arena with lot of jumps, rail grind and halfpipe areas. Big on scooters with some of the best athletes practicing here regularly. Occasional scooter camps are well worth it. Great place and friendly staff! Indoor style soccer fields are great wheb leagues start up. Roller rinks are also great. Lots going for this part of Kit Carson Park!< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dbf3e3f981d2f7:0xeef9481be8686fc7</Gmap_id></record>

<review>Nice sports park. I have played personally at this park in over 10 years but we just visited a today to watch friends play in a little league game. There is plenty of parking close to the fields. There are bleachers sitting and trees for shade. There is a public restroom close to the baseball fields. The was a good truck there selling snacks.</review><name>Dan L</name>< Pics>

Don't know anything about the soccer courts or skate park, I'm sure they're fine. But I love the hockey rinks. Pick up games for $2 on Thursday nights and I'm able to play regularly for the first time in almost a decade.< /Review>

<Review>How have I NOT rated this place before?! My child plays roller hockey here as a member of the Westview Roller Hockey Team. As an Assnt. Coach, the staff here has been AWESOME in supporting rink requests (there are two recently upgraded surfaces). I have never had a negative experience with the staff; they rock!< /Review>< pics>

<Text>Would give better rating but the customer service is seriously lacking!  When you tell a customer you'll look into something and get back to them.....you get back to them. Not wait until later when the customer is standing in front of and the represses oh they didn't call you back because what you requested wasn't possible.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Office should be open as long as park hours have the fields open. When teams play in door soccer and need ID cards it should be available for public until the venue is closed.<//text>

<Review>Food was good. But I don't recommend eating there. Get take out. Use the drive thru.
A LOT of vagrants and crazy filthy yelling people. They have to turn off the soda machines to prevent soda theft. So you have to ask for them to be turned on, before you can refil
Felt bad for the staff, I would not want to work there. There is a nice outdoor eating patio. Sheriff had stopped some drunk guy there. Bathrooms outside, need token.
Too bad as the staff was nice, food is good.< /Review>< Pics>

<resp>None</resp><Review>i've been to this location twice. The first time the taco shells were overcooked, almost burned and the meat was dry, but any restaurant can have a bad day. I went back a few weeks later and it's the same thing. Even the cookies are dry and hard! It's almost as if they are trying to get a worst food award.< /Review><user_id>104128799084288945753< /user_id><gmapID>0x80c25793def85425:0x530becf5672e0790</gmapID>< name>

Food was all bad you had to wait for them while they was talking and finally some one came and took my order then ask to use the bathroom again had to wait looking at you all crazy and attitude you should have people to appreciate a job like that stead of attitudes and waiting for 15 minutes before one of them came and took my order bad bad place with messed up people in it</text>

<userid>111300548901942577737</userid><Name>Jimmy JL<//Name><review>(Translated by Google) My food was not fresh, I bought some fish tacos and it looked like they had been cooked from previous days and they reheated it, the vegetables were old and withered and dark, the lemons were old and stiff, the probes area was dirty and splashed everywhere, most of the tables had crumbs, cheese or other food. The chain of this restaurant I like but this restaurant specifically does not.

(Original)
Mi comida no me la dieron fresca, compré unos tacos de pescado y pareciese que los cocinaron de días anteriores y lo recalentaron, la verdura estaba vieja marchita y de color obscuro, los limones viejos y rececos además el área de sondas estaba sucia y con salpicaduras por doquier, la mayoría de las mesas tenían migajas, queso o resto de comida. La cadena de este restaurante me gusta pero este restaurante en específico no.< /review>< Response>

Our lunch group has eaten at the Patio several times. The wait staff are friendly, helpful and patient and the food is usually great.  I have to say it's better when the Vietnamese chef is there - if you like Vietnamese food.  The menu is pretty varied though and so far no one has complained if we get loud.  We usually eat outside weather permitting.<//Review>

It took a while for my order to get done, but after eating it was worth the wait. It was popular dish this evening. I would recommend The Patio as long as you don't mind waiting.</review>

The waitress I had was good. Attentive and friendly. The food is ok, someone needs to teach the cook about seasoning the food. My food was pretty bland. I had asked the waitress for a little extra cilantro and onion, and she wasn't allowed to. Seriously? I understand about working with a small budget, but how are you going to get customers to keep coming back if you cannot please them? It is because of those customers is the reason why you have jobs.<//Text>

Back for the killer tri-tip street tacos. On my lunch and these guys move. Hardly waited at all, well it didn’t seem like I did as they have so many TV’s displaying different sports etc, it went by so fast.
Food is awesome, service is great
I will be back and, it is worth the visit every time.< /review>

<Text>Good decently priced food.  I'm unsure of the days the pho chef isn't working .Great bar and television located at nearly every corner.  They do a great job of keeping the smoke out of the restaurant.  They also have a huge outdoor patio draped with vinyl walls/ windows.  Perfect for a quick lunch visit.< /Text>< pics>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Great food during normal business hours. But don't try to order anything just before the Vietnamese chef leaves at 7pm. It took an hour to get my order of just 3 soups and 1 spring roll to go. The worst part was the staff kept lying that "It's just being wrapped up now" while I continued to wait for another half an hour. Maybe they're used to treating people like scum since they work at a casino.</Review>< pictures>

#CAclassic. BL"A"T w/fries!  It was PERFECT!  Even the bread was toasted - perfectly!  Truly enjoyed my meal.  Can't wait 2 check out Sunday Brunch.... again.  Enjoyed it w/family a few years ago & left with a smile on my face put there by the wonderful meal & lovely conversation.  Make sure if your in the area you stop by & try it for yourself.

#gamble. Storefront is the PLAYERS CLUB CASINO.  I'm not a card player, but the atmosphere was thick with intrigue & the anticipation ofa winning hand showed on each players "poker face"!< /Review>

The Patio is a great place to meet for a casual business lunch. The food is fairly priced and the service is expedient. The wait staff tends to be friendly and attentive. The food is what can be expected for the price point and setting.< /Text>

The Food was not prepared properly. It was through all the way (Steaks). They were brought back the second time, but still a little cold. Then the waiter said the management was to give a 15% off our ticket, but the management didn't know how. this is the 21st century and should not have been a problem. I would have let a bigger tip if things had been taken care of. I would should have think some type of refund would have been in ordered.< /review>

When the Vietnamese food's being served (not every day), it's downright amazing. Some of their appetizers are a bit disappointing, however, with their jalapeno poppers lacking in cheese or, in a few cases, the jalapeno.

The other issue is that it's attached to the Player's Casino, and you're stuck dealing with people that like to smoke outside the entrance, or nearly impossible parking.< /Text>

<review>Mother's Day dinner. Wasn't very busy which was a plus. We had a party of 8. We called and made a reservation, but it wasn't busy so there really wasn't a need. My daughter ordered the fettucini Alfredo with clams, I didn't try it and she said it was good. I had half a roasted chicken. That was joke. Half a chicken was two small pieces. I also ordered the margherita pizza. I returned it. It was not good. Side salad was good. Don't thibkni would go back.<//review>< pictures>

Not bad. Not great. Lower prices and/or larger portions could both add another star.<//Review>

Had an excellent experience with Michelle. My daughter’s legs are very sore from playing catcher in softball and I went in to get her something to help between games. Michelle offered me a few samples to try. She was very knowledgeable and pleasant to speak with. I will be going back next week to purchase some products!</text>

Firstly, I’d like to say that this is the best CBD shop I’ve been to in the area. It’s clear that their product is top of the line and the staff is super knowledgeable about it. Emma was very helpful the other day and allowed me to sample some water soluble CBD. Although I ultimately bought a vape that time, a few days later I called in to order the water soluble tincture, which they delivered to my home!!! This place is incredible, the staff is awesome and I’d highly recommend it to anyone interested in CBD. Thank you Emma and your colleague (I’m so sorry I forgot your name!!!)< /text>

<review>Your CBD Store has the highest quality products on the market with a variety of options to choose from based on my specific needs.

Every team member that I have interacted with has been knowledgeable and exceeds my expectations. I can trust that what I’m purchasing is worth it because every question I ask is answered by them with precision.

Emma is always greeting me by name with her great smile and personality. She is always sincere and genuine because she cares about the customers well-being. I believe that she trusts in the advantages that the product will give you, therefore she is confident with how to mend your specific need.

I’m always looking forward to walking in to the store because the service, atmosphere, and overall quality is, in my opinion, the gold standard of CBD.</review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Emma is AMAZING!!!

I had a question about a product that was posted on Instagram and Emma was so helpful in answering my questions - without having to ask, she offered to deliver some samples so that I can try the product out before committing. Not only did she come by to hand deliver it, she also included some other samples that with a sweet hand written note and info on how to use the other products.

This is my first time trying CBD products and I'm SO happy that it was with Emma and Your CBD Store.<//Review>

I have never tried Cbd before but I was desperate because I was starting a new job. I have anxiety and insomnia. Emma was the SWEETEST and so caring. She went above and beyond to help me out and even do a porch delivery sample pack. I tried the gummies that she gave me and they worked SO WELL!! I have told everyone about them! I have so many friends interested! I will be stopping by and stocking up on my cbd goodies and I know they will be as well! Thank you Emma for going above and beyond for me. It is so greatly appreciated. You represent your company so well and they are very lucky to have a rep like you!!!<//Text>

This store is so quaint and peaceful! Emma is so knowledgeable and informed about all the products available!! She shared her knowledge with me about Sun Med Topical Cream 2000 mg due to my extreme knee pain! I was skeptical, but IT WORKED 100%!! Thank you Emma for taking time with me, you’re great!</review>

Huge “thank you” to Lauren at the Thousand Oaks store!! She was generous with her time and knowledge today, helping my husband and me figure out the best CBD priducts to use for a wide range of issues (back, hip and shoulder pain, as well as sleep issues).  Used the cbd cream and are already getting good results! She was wonderful and these are quality products.< /text>

I have been coming here for a while now for my back pain. Lauren and Emma have been very kind and have helped me greatly. Their CBD products always help relieve my back pain, even after my back surgery. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is interested in starting or using CBD products.< /Text>

<Review>I’ve been wanting to try CBD products for a while, but I’ve been hesitant because I know very little about them and what they do to/for your body. When I visited this store, the employee, Emma, assisted me. She was incredibly knowledgeable about each of the products and was able to explain everything to me in a simple manner. I will definitely be coming back when my tincture runs out, and hope to be helped by Emma again!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e825e9876a6831:0x2517308639ef020<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I was relatively new to the idea of supplementing with CBD to help with various issues, and I’m so glad I decided to give It a try. Lauren, the shop owner, is so wonderfully friendly and knowledgeable. She really deeply cares for every single person that enters her store. Her employees are all so kind and helpful too.  They are open about their experiences with the products they sell and i feel very comfortable talking about my anxiety issues, PTSD, and migraines with them. There was no hard sell to buy the products. They were happy just to listen and provide information. They even have samples available of the water-soluble CBD that you can try there. It was nice to be able to try It out before purchasing. I tend to be a  a pretty private person and I am not quick to open up about myself, but everything about this place, from the soothing decor and layout, to the way the employees so obviously care for their customers, makes this little place an absolute gem in my book.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80e825e9876a6831:0x2517308639ef020< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I started taking Sunmed CBD consistantly in October of 2018 for Anxiety and Depression. I had been prescribed Anti Depressants and an Anti Anxiety medication that I wasn't comfortable taking due to the possible side effects. Within two weeks of taking CBD, I noticed a major difference in my daily anxiety and depression symptoms. This product gave me my life back. I am incredibly grateful to have found such an effective supplement to help manage my anxiety and depression.<//Text><user_id>109235461624218929367< /user_id>< rate>

<review>The staff was awesome. The cashier was able to explain exactly what it is and the uses of CBD. I've never really consumed anything like it so wasn't sure what it was all about. I got the gummy snacks, suggested to calm my nerves and assist in sleep. I have taken 2 now and I can say It seemed to have worked I got a good nights sleep did 1 time with my fan on, and once without both sleeps logged about the same with my fitness tracker< /review><Date>1582840836336< /Date>< Gmap_id>

This is the best quality I have ever had. I’ve tried so many different brands and they all have side effects that do not make me feel good. The store is convenient and very clean and nice.

The store is beautifully decorated and very welcoming! The staff is very knowledgeable and have samples of the products to try before you buy. I have been using the water soluble for my anxiety and it has made a difference and I am off prescription meds. I love using the topical cream for my sons eczema and for my knee pain.

I had to write this review and share my experience. I have had bad hip pain, arthritis for one year which lately was getting worse. I started with the SunMed Hemp supplement oil 500mg one week ago and today I awoke with no pain! I am so happy with the product and will continue using it day and night.

<text>Went in Your CBD Store #Westlake after work today to purchase 1000 mg Lemon. Emma helped me out & she is always upbeat with a positive attitude as this is my second visit at that location. I just got back from Las Vegas and regretfully bought some CBD out there. SUNMED is my personal go to. Also, they had Daft Punk playing-One More Time#GoodVibes< /text><user_id>101736316732493150180<//user_id><Name>Alfred Zambrana</Name>< pictures>

i was a little nervous going into a CBD shop for the first time but it was like walking into a spa.  the store was light and bright and their representative was helpful and knowledheable.  she was able to answer all of my questions regarding my dog's anxiety and my foot pain.  a great experience.< /text>

<review>I purchased the Sunmed 750 mg oil today, tried it for the first time and did not feel much difference.

I received a call from Lauren, the owner of the store right away, she took her time and explain to me how to consume it right and asked to keep follow up with me.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<text>Found this through Google search. Needed a CBD topical for hip flexor pain and for my Mom's torn meniscus. Bought 2 small jars of their Sun Med topical relief cream, 1000+ mg total cannabinoids. Also purchased a bottle of Mimi's Apothecary organic elderberry syrup with local honey as a cold and allergy body ache preventative.
Prices seem a bit high but this is also my first buying this type of product, so maybe this is a standard price.  Store was very clean and well organized.
Hoping the CBD topical helps with the aches!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>I am a Route91 Concert, Las Vegas  survivor.  My life changed drastically, I suffered of frequent panic and anxiety attacks.  I was prescribed about 3 different types of antidepressants while trying to find one that worked for me.  I am not much into taking prescribed medications.  I am all about a natural holistic approach first, therefore I hated taking them -made me feel fogged up and sick.  Then I was introduced to CBD oil by a dear friend of mine who is also a Rt91 survivor; she had been using the CBD oil for sometime and I saw the difference it made for her.  I began at first using a vape pen (immediate relief to an onset panic/anxiety attack) and now I also use the water soluble, hard candy, gummies.... It has made all the difference in the world.  I got completely off the antidepressants and my attacks have subsided.  Can't say enough great things about these products -thank you!<//Review>< user>

This year was our second time rafting with families and friends. Friendly staff and well organized especially for us with a group of 48. Looking for fun and great summer escapade? Sunshine Rafting at Knights Ferry is a place to be. Safety is their primary concern. They have lifeguards stationed along the route to remind you of what's ahead!< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I have made reservations to go rafting four times and once for kayaking. My group had a great time overall. The online system is easy to use. The times that I called Sunshine Rafting everyone was friendly and knowledgeable. The customer service is great from the time we turn in the liability forms to approaching the staff who gets the group prepared to get on the raft. The staff is friendly and funny. The experience of actually rafting and/or kayaking on the water is super fun, relaxing, and I find the whole trip to be therapeutic to be in nature and decompress. It is definitely worth the cost and it is an unforgettable experience.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x8090e5711e03a7e5:0xc9adeff67b52536c< /GmapID></record>

If you have to have fun with family and friends at a low cost. This is the place. We had soooooo much fun rafting. We took our son who is 8 years old and he had a blast. We have gone twice already and will be going in 2 weeks again. The staff is so friendly and helpful. this is a good place to get out of the house and enjoy getting wet while it is blistering hot out side. 10/10 Recommend.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>I have been rafting with Sunshine rafting since I was prob. 14 years old. I love our annual rafting trip and always know we can reach out to Shiloh Foust and get a response back so quickly to set everything up and if we have any questions I know they will be answered and I don't have to stress about our trip at all. I have been down this river when its been very high, very slow and low and all the in-betweens and always feel safe. Thank you Sunshine rafting for bringing our family and friends together each year for our rafting trip. Everyone looks forward to it!<//review>< user_id>

<review>I have been using Sunshine rafting for years. Perfect for large groups and families! They provide a waterproof lock-box, raft, paddles and life vests. They also take your picture for FREE and post the so you can use them for whatever you need. My elderly parents had a great time and I highly recommend Sunshine Rafting Adventures!<//review>< GmapID>

Great way to spend the day with friends & family. Had the most wonderful time! Fellow rafters are absolutely Awesome! Definitely a workout when the river slows but with a little bit of team work & a lot of elbow grease. You can meet time deadlines & still enjoy your time. Not just a floating experience, paddling is very much so needed at points in the river.<//Text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Excellent family friendly rafting trip (we did the orange blossom segment). Staff was friendly and professional, equipment was great, and the whole process was quick and efficient. The trip takes roughly 4.5 hours. The flow is not strong in July, a few minor rapids but mostly pleasant rafting. Very kid friendly with a lot of opportunities to stop, swim or picnic.
During COVID 19 staff were wearing masks, socially distanced parties on the shuttle ride and took necessary precautions. Thank you.<//Text>< pics>

<text>This was our first time rafting, and it was way better than I expected. I booked the trip on Thursday, and we were in the water Saturday. The entire experience was awesome. Parking was easy, staff informative and friendly even with triple digit heat. The rafts were in great condition.
The only downside is that we just found out about this rafting  option at the end of the season. We are planning multiple trips next year. As a family, and with boyscouts.</text>< pictures>

<UserId.>113000460481544307445<//UserId.><text>Me, my husband and our 2 children went on a family rafting adventure to kick off our 4th of July festivities.  Staff was very informative and the line to get out on the water moved quickly and orderly. We had a great time working together to get our raft downstream.  It was nice to spend quality family time out in nature without without the distraction of technology.  Definitely plan to do it again soon!< /text></record></dataset><record>

It was my first time rafting yesterday and overall it was very fun. The instructors were informative and show you exactly what to do so that you would be prepared. The only thing that I did not like what the other people rafting, all of us decided to go rafting to relax and enjoy our time instead we kept getting squirt at by adults and kids even after we asked them nicely not to wet us. They wet us so much that two of us got hurt since we couldnt see where we were going because of all the water in our eyes.<//Text>

Registration process was easy, we were provided a lot of helpful information once registered, and the day of was orchestrated well.  Customer service was great, very friendly and helpful.  We took our kids ages 5 - 11 and all of them had a fun time.  We stopped a few times along the way to picnic, just play in the water.  Water was low, there weren't very many rapids, but it was still a lot of fun. Water was also a bit cold, but we got used it and had a fun time just being away and doing something new.  Worth the time and money, hoping to do it again!  Thanks Sunshine!</review><gmapID>0x8090e5711e03a7e5:0xc9adeff67b52536c<//gmapID></record>

Great thing to do together as family. The first time we booked with Sunshine Rafting it was organized and they are just fun to be around. We have been doing this almost every year. I even recommended this to my friends and we had a blast doing the river rafting. We cannot wait to do it again next month. It is highly recommended!!!</Review>

<Review>We went on a rafting trip as part of a party for the company that my wife works for and it was such a fantastic trip! The staff were really nice and supportive. The rafting was fun, exciting at times but not scary. It was a pretty peaceful trip along the water with plenty of great places to stop, swim and goof off! I do recommend bringing a cooler full of drinks, good sunblock, and food. Asside from that you really don't need anything. Life jackets, a waterproof box, paddles and a very durable raft we're all included. We had as many as 10 people on a raft at times (we started with 7 per raft but people like to move around). I highly recommend this company and we all wanted to do it again after the fun we had!<//Review>< pics>

<text>A great starter rafting adventure.  The river was a mixture of Class 1 and 2 white water.  In other parts of the Stanislaus River, you will experience a calm water you can swim around the raft.  On a hot summer day, the cool mountain water is so refreshing.   Bring your sunscreen!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Took my boys and my nephew for the first time this July, they loved it!!!  Very well organized. Nice staff.  Easy to schedule.  We went on special promo day of rafting for only $15 per person. PER PERSON!!!  It was great.  Rafting took about 5 hours, we took plenty of water and snacks.  Having a cooler really worked out great.  Great rafting experience for beginners and a great family trip.  Highly recommend them.  We will be definitely be doing this annually.<//text>

Great rafting company. They had our whole trip planned out from start to finish, they had guides posted on important parts in the river, and all their equipment is up-to-snuff. They did fall short in the picture department (I had to look through a dozen to find the one photo I was in). Otherwise, this is a great rafting company.<//Review>

Sunshine rafting is always a blast! This September was my 3rd adventure there on Labor Day Weekend. Its a beautiful view, and a really fun time for an affordable price. You cant beat a full day of adventure for the price! The staff always answer the phone to answer our questions, and accommodated us when we were a little late due to traffic. The whole process is so easy from check in, to hopping on the bus to get back to the parking lot. Thank you Sunshine Rafting!<//Text>

I left a message for Sunshine Rafting Adventrues a few weeks ago and was so happy that Shiloh called me back quickly with information. I plan on booking a summer float trip and have a bunch of friends joining us, so getting info out to everyone sooner than later is important.

We spoke for a while on the phone and once all my questions were answered he emailed over a few pages of information re nearby camping, activities, and restaurants, things to do and places to go off the river, costs, and what not/to bring. Very helpful and I'm totally looking forward to our summer trip already!</text><name>Amy Palmer< /name>< user_id>

SUPER FUUUNNN!!!  My husband and I went just the two of us. You get your own boat - they don't make you share with strangers. It was just SOOOO much fun! Definitely going to do this again!! Use lots of sunscreen.  We went again two weeks later and tried to go one more time before the season ended but we couldn't get our schedules rearranged.  I cannot believe we didn't do this sooner!  We'll be there next year!!!!< /text>

I enjoyed this trip very much. The directions were very clear and helpful, fast check in. The rafting in general was smooth, good work out, extremely fun when battling with other customers (water fights). I do wish the water wasn't so low, but can't fix that much due to CA water drought. Overall it was a wonderful experience.< /review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Sunshine's river rafting uses false advertisement. They claim that there's lots of Rapids and that it's an enjoyable experience. What they don't tell you is ,there is one quick flow spot ,where a person sits with a camera to take your picture at that one five foot long stretch of quicker flow not even Rapids. What they don't tell you is the rest of the river is so low you have to get out and carry 150 lbs raft across multiple spots that are barely one foot deep. Will never be a returning customer. The trip has also been shortened over the years. The float used to take you all the way down to Orange Blossom now they kick you out at Horseshoe Bend or sooner depending on the flow. The shuttle service is very unsatisfactory< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>
{'time': 1545588263571, 'text': 'Hi Kenneth,\n\nFirst, I want to say thanks for taking the time to go online and rate our services.  We are, of course, disappointed that you didn\'t enjoy the trip.  I would like to address some items in your review (just for clarification for people reading):\n\n-After a little research on our end, you appear to have gone rafting in late May/early June of 2015 (3 and a half years ago).  2015 was the very peak of the severe drought that impacted almost every river in Northern CA (including our Stanislaus River).  Because of that, there were special rules in 2015 with the lower water levels.\n\n-Since 2015, we\'ve had  stronger water years, and flows have been 2-10x as high as you saw in 2015.\n\n-We only end our trip at Horseshoe Park during very low water years, because it simply takes far too long to go to Orange Blossom.  The last three summers (2016-2018), all trips have taken out at Orange Blossom Park, and based on water levels, that should continue for at least the next couple of seasons.\n\nWe are sorry you caught us on a low water year- they aren\'t nearly as fun as when water levels are average or above!  We now post all up to date on our website RaftAdventure.com under the "Water levels/flow" section.\n\nFeel free to reach out to us at info@raftadventure.com and we can try to set your group up with a trip at a flow that you might find more ideal.'}<//resp>

<Review>Rafting was something I never did before, so finally with triple digit temperatures this past weekend, we decided try this sunshine rafting adventure. We made a reservation which was easy and convenient on the web. Arrived on our day, parked and was sent to our rafts awaiting us after check-in process which was a breeze. Long story short the entire process and rafting trip was well worth it! I can tell you that I will for sure be making more trips with this company. They make you feel very welcomed and assist you in anyway to make your adventure as fun as possible. At the end of your rafting trip, you then get shuttled back to the parking lot. I can tell you I will for sure spread the word to all my friends, and family which I have already had been doing. Thank you very much Sunshine Rafting! See ya again soon!< /Review>< pictures>

The whole process was very smooth and I definitely felt safe. They also go to where you will end to ensure you make the shore. I recommend this rafting for any family!!!

<Review>Some friends and I took a rafting trip with Sunshine a couple of weeks ago with our college.  It was a lot of fun, and really easy to get together and do.  The employees were all easy to work with and the safety talk at the beginning of the trip was really helpful (when they say duck under the trees, you should prolly listen!).  Anyways, great time, not expensive, and remember to bring sunscreen!< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

This was our fourth Annual Family & Friends rafting event. Sunshine Rafting. Shiloh and his staff are wonderful to work with. They educate our new rafters in all the safety requirements to keep them safe and have fun on the river. Each year our group gets bigger and bigger. We look forward to coming back every year!!!< /text>

< Review>
We had the most pleasant day last month, rafting down the Stanislaus river with Sunshine Rafting Adventures Knights Ferry. This was my first experience in rafting. Their equipment is first class, very stable and safe. Friendly staff, polite and experienced in the sport. We started with a safety briefing, and launched our raft, four of us on board. Took us five mn to figure out the strategy, and down the river we went. They even have a photographer at the rapids who took beautiful pictures of our crew, making lasting memories. The river is beautiful at that spot. Surrounded by green trees and grasses, although we are in a drought. Fish everywhere! bring your fishing rod ! After 6 hours of rafting which included a picnic and pitch stop, staff was waiting at the rendez vous spot , took care of our raft and unloaded all our belongings. Back to the starting point in a fancy bus/van, same courtesy from the driver. The cost was reasonable, I would recommend Sunshine Rafting to anyone looking for an unforgettable experience.</Review>

This southwest themed store opened up about 6 months ago and I have only been here about five times. My visits are mostly aimed at produce and lunch from their food court. Their produce and selection is excellent and prices pretty competitive. Their food court has a large assortment of quick bites and also fresh bulk for larger gatherings. The store is very clean and staff is very friendly and helpful.< /Review>

I love this Vallarta!! The Carniceria (meat market) is the best!! BE CAREFUL THOUGH...CUIDADO!!! The parking lot is uneven so when your cart is full, you can easily lose control of it and if empty, they have a tendency to roll away and possibly run into another car.< /Text>

Love this store... fresh fruits and veggies, carnitas, buche, masa, tortillas and chicharones. They have a great selection of meats and seafood. The store is super clean and is close to the 99 freeway.

I drive from Sacramento once a month to get items that none of the Mexican stores in Sacramento offer.

***Wish they'd open a store closer to Sacramento!***< /Review>

Vallarta is a great place to buy chicken. I always find the good deals on the meats. I always look at the ads and I see some good deals here and there. Great fried chicken at the taqueria. I just wish they would include chicken breast for that leg and thigh deal. The only thing that bothers me is that social distancing isn't happening. The holidays were crazy busy and I was shocked  to see no one keeping the distance. So glad Vallarta has self checkout. So easy and quick.
Cashier's are very helpful. Excellent customer service.< /review>

Went to get some plant base protein tacos at 7:30 ish PM. Sad story, they were out! No one in the kitchen crew was willing to please the customer. Ah, but manager Juanita came and saved the night. My tacos were made and we're delicious 😋 Thank you Juanita for the excellent customer service.< /Review>

I always loved going to Vallarta because of the fresh veggies and low prices. Today I got a shock. Wow they've gone up on their prices, Cucumbers were 69 cents each, tomato sauce was 50 cents for a tiny little can. I saw salsa for maybe half a cup for over 4 dollars and quacamole for about 9 dollars. O MG too much for this girl.</review>

The store was clean, and the staff was relatively friendly/helpful. The shelves were well stocked and the prrices seemed fair. Staff and customers were practicing Social Distancing as much as possible and with the exception of a few people, masks were worn throughout the store.</Text>

<review>I am madly in love with this grocery store!! It is a mexican grocery store that has a bakery, tortilleria, carniceria, ice cream parlor, organic juicing bar, sushi bar, cooked meals for take out, mini flower shop, dulceria(candy section) & so much more. My absolute favorite was the sea food section!! They sell a 3 section platter that contains shrimp ceviche, crab ceviche, & fish ceviche. If you cannot find the platter just go to the sea food section & simply request it!! You can even ask for half of a pound of the ceviche you want. They also have a section where they sell a variety of caramel apples. They all have  caramel but are covered in different flavors like oreos, coffee flavor, nuts & more. If you have not been you need to go!</review>< Pics>

<Text>Went opening day was extremely happy and delighted that they were finally in Madera. But, to my horror,  I was over charged on item(s) that were marked on the bag $2.00, my receipt showed $8.00. When confronted store mgr admitted it was a mistake, but boldly told me she had to check the cameras and would contact me on Wednesday its now Friday and no follow up. So who is the thief? Someone who cheats consumers s/becareful. I personally will not stop there again. Feel sorry for those who do shop there make sure you check the prices against your receipt.

Update: Still no contact. It is clear that I was accused of dishonesty which is slander when I know I have done nothing wrong. I guess the alleged cameras were never checked. I seriously caution anyone shopping here, be aware that the dishonesty lies within, check and match, look at the pricing, use a calculator if the totals don’t match question it or make them review their aisle pricing, it’s easy for stores to steal money from its customers. Do not leave the store until you validate that you have been charged correctly.</Text>< Pics>

It's a great place but the only thing it needs is  to get Goya pasteles is a Puerto Rican style tamale. If you order some I guarantee you they'll be gone because  I will call all my Puerto  Ricans in Madera and Fresno. 🇵🇷🙏 Thanks. MERRY CHRISTMAS!</text>

Store looks good as the ones in Fresno. Wait times in Cocina take a little long I am thinking because the store just opened. Best thing right now is the Sushi Cocina it is awesome!<//review>

<Text>Their Aguas Frescas were soooooo delicious.  I got the banana strawberry and my girlfriend got the strawberry with mint and it was just straight fuego 🔥 📛 👨‍🚒 🚒 🧯 🎆 🔥 📛 👨‍🚒 🚒

Update*
Their burritos are disgusting, so plain... their Cubano torta is beyond delicious. A bit on the messy side but very tasty<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Finally went here because my husband loves Vallarta Supermarkets.  I was impressed with their selection of Latin American products.  If you need something, they probably have it here.  I bought a container of store made Mexican jello and guacamole.  Jello was just ok,  but the guacamole was really good.  Even at $7 a pound I am willing to keep going back for more.  The meat and deli selection is pretty good too they have several types of chorizo.
I didn't purchase anything from the hot food section because the line didn't look busy at dinner time which is not a good sign and the food looked a little on the dry side like it had been sitting out a minute.  The one area I was not impressed with was the pan dulce. Their pastries were just not good.  Their orejas (latin version of French oreilles) were on the salty side because they didn't put enough sugar on the pastry dough to caramelize it.  I bought an empanada de crema(or queso as the label it).  The custard filling needed more sugar I could taste the salt in it.  The dough/crust was also bland.  The biggest disappointment by far though was the pan "fino" that I purchased with a creme filling.  I cut it in half to share with my husband and the top crust was RAW.  I have been served dry, burnt, and under seasoned foods before but never have I been served a raw crust.

So there are some good things there and bad things here.  Great product and deli selection.  Guacamole is great, I will keep coming back for more.  But they need to get themselves a new panadero.</review>

<review>Big new store. Lots of fresh produce and items.

Please train your cashiers/front end to be more mindful of treating their customers. I was standing in line and the cashier in the next lane barely opened and let the customer behind me cut in line. I didnt mind because it was a mother with small children.  Then I was almost getting ready to put my stuff on the cash register conveyer belt in my own lane until my cashier immediately places the "Close" sign on there and rudely says to me, "I'm closed." I asked her, "You're closed now?" You're not opening up?" and she repeated, "Yes, im closed." If it was another customer,  she would've been told. Please do a better job at customer service and managing the front end or you will lose customers.< /review>< username>

<review>Love Vallarta. They offer variety of Mexican items all in one place. Not to mention great food, awesome drinks such as mamey, horchata, melón  & much more. When I lived in Fresno I enjoyed going to shop there & am very happy that a store in madera has been built since I moved back to town. 5 stars all the way!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Awesome live menu with David Marconi. Excellent server.  Enjoyed Mediterranean food.   Shout out to their staff for finding my wife’s loss bracelet and arranging to send it to us in Texas! Great job Elie !!! (Spelling ??)< /Text>

Great tasting room to relax after a long day. The wines are pretty tasty and the service is wonderful. Make sure you swing by for the wine and other musical events they host 👌🏼<//review>

<text>Good start for a first timer in wine country. The girls working/hanging out at the time were so welcoming and chill. A great place to just try good wine and hang, or get some reading done. Close to downtown for walking and/or bar hopping.</text>< resp>

<Text>I have been a devotee of “Butter” since its inception.  I buy it by the case.   I am finding the 2018 production ver heavy, and much less palatable than previous releases.  Please be aware in producing 2019 production.<//Text>< gmap_id>

My friend and I popped into JaM Cellars on the last leg of our trip to Napa. The first thing you notice about the facility is the amazing musical atmosphere. The set up as a tasting room and small live music setting works so well. Would love to come back another time to listen to live music. Mat was our JaMbassador, and I could have easily stayed there the rest of the afternoon chit chatting, he was super fun to talk to and captivating! The wines were good and very fairly priced. I’d definitely recommend their Candy Rose’! Will certainly be returning my next trip to Napa.< /text>

<review>I could not have had a worse experience. We are 2 plus sized ladies and Travis could barely give us the time of day, although as soon as a pretty skinny girl walked in he was more than willing to chat and completely ignored us. We tried to talk him about this and he accused us of forgetting things when we both confirm those conversations did not happen. Sizism is alive and well here, so I guess if you’re skinny and hot you will like it< /review>< pictures>

They pour and sell their own reasonably priced wine ($15 to $40 for a bottle). I particularly liked their whites. The younger staff member who served us was very hospitable and great at his job. Excellent experience and a fantastically comfortable place to enjoy a few glasses.<//Text>< pics>

<text>JaM was the first stop we made in Napa and it was a great choice. The bartender was extremely helpful in helping us plan the rest of our trip. She gave us a map that she has personally circled her favorite wineries on and wrote comments about each one. We followed her recommendations for wineries the next day and every one was amazing.

The prices were also great for Napa wine and the vibe was very relaxing and casual. A great place place to hang out before dinner, especially because it's one of the only tasting rooms open well into the evening. We will definitely be back!</text>< Pics>

Can you guys get more Nike shoes and exclusive new shoes? This store has the ugliest and oldest Nikes. They don’t even have air max 95s. Get more air max 90’s and 95’s. I’ve been to a different Hibbett that has new Nike shoes before they even drop online.</text>

Good shoes to buy there i bought a pair of nmd ‘s and i love them they ordered them for me and gave me an option to pay half so i did and then paid the rest when they arrived and i havent stopped wearing them, i only found out about that store because of my friends and i went for the first time and dropped $300 on clothing and shoes and they gave me 20% off like wow thats awesome so im saving some money on what i spent so i very highly recommend going so you can go christmas shopping for your friends and family because their are some really good prices that other places cant beat also the workers are the best they are so chill they will help you with anything you need just ask and they will more than likely help you out! :D< /Review>

Came in to buy some gifts for my husbands birthday and I know how much he loves shoes so I wanted to see their selection. As I walked in I was not greeted, they were just talking amongst themselves, one of the guys was on their phone doing who knows what. Sadly only one guy was actually doing his job. No one asked me if I needed help with anything. Unfortunately I couldn’t find anything for my husband since I didn’t have a second opinion on some shoes I was looking at so I went to the mall instead. Customer service was just horrible and I’m never shopping here again.< /text>

shoes were on clearance they were uncomfortable and the other pair was alright but was a display shoe so it wasn't like getting a brand new shoe it was the opposite. kind of smells a little to be honest. no point in speaking with the GM< /review><name>Sixto Nunez</name><rating>1<//rating><gmapID>0x80daf767d1352abf:0xd38a757edf8b182< /gmapID><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

They actually got my order wrong, BUT Adan was so amazing and because of him and his customer service, they get 5 stars. HE gets five stars. He was so helpful and nice. Would 100% go back just to have him take my order< /Text>

<Text>I used to love this place before they moved.  I've stopped going daily,  now I'll go to another one! The drinks are made wrong everytime. Customer service has gone was down.  They made move my car to a spot to wait for my drink.  I sat there for 15 minutes with no drink. I went inside,  the manager shrugged her shoulders and said we're training partners!?<//Text>< Pics>

<name>Kathleen Stewart< /name><Date>1604695731580<//Date><Rating>1</Rating><text>I ordered two drinks via mobile app primarily because I needed to use the restroom. I was informed that the restrooms were closed but that In N Out's were open. Unfortunately, I was not a customer there and had already ordered my coffees. It's very upsetting that they won't let a customer use their restrooms. Waited a longtime too since no one was calling out the finished orders. One nice young man finally took initiative and cleaned out the room of everyone waiting. In the future, I will save myself trouble and go to the Yosemite location.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809142fe1bbce8c1:0x64862c0122e3115f< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>We stopped in for the "2 for the price of 1" deal today. There was at least 25 cars in front of us and it inly took us about 15 minutes total time. That's pretty remarkable if you ask me. Plus, the baristas were pleasant as usual. The mad all-day rush did not dampen their mood. It was a pleasant, satisfying experience. Like  always!< /review><rating>5<//rating><user>106835782835007740396</user>< Date>

Great service overall. However, The extremely large barista, Jesse, is very rude and moves sluggishly behind the counter. Other than her rude behavior, all staff members are great!</Review>

Called to speak to Ian to check their hours so I can turn back but he stated they were closed already at 8:55pm and aren't able to assist me! I waited in lined for about 20 minutes just to not be happy with my drinks! Smh.. I don't understand why they can't make a drink just right if they make alot of the same drinks throughout the day. Don't these employees get trained the same way??? Very disappointed! Thanks STARBUCKS for NOT making my drinks rights!

This place is a joke, the slowest crew making cups of coffee. 35min wait so they can make the wrong coffee then make me wait longer for them to make the right one at the same time they ask me what I ordered.<//Review>

Wouldn't recommend this coffeeshop. I was absolutely disappointed by the speed and quality of service. There wasn't a line inside the cafe, however, I waited around 15 minutes just to get my cappuccino. The priority is a car line. On 1 customer inside the cafe there were 3 in drive-through line. The biggest disappointment was in a quality of coffee.Instead of making coffee with foam, my cappuccino was just a hot milk with coffee. Looks like staff was training how to make the coffee for my money.
Moreover, I asked a couple of times about warm cappuccino instead of hot, and information was added by a cashier. And after 15 minutes of waiting I got my extra hot coffee. There was a label  attached to the drink with "Warm" note, but who cares, right..
For my 4 dollars I'd got some coffee with hot milk.
Was it cappuccino? I don't think so.
Were my request considered? Absolutely, not.
Does anybody care about it except me? No.<//Review>

Super horrible and disgusting. I ordered a pink drink and the drink was all nasty with super cracked coconut milk and it tasted sour. I asked the barista to remake it, she acted like she did, but apparently she didn’t she just shaked the same drink and still looked the same. DISAPPOINTED<//Text>

<review>Starbucks is Starbucks so not much to tell you however, service at this location is extremely lacking. Stopped here just this morning on my way to work and let me tell you, I was a minute away from cancelling my order.....that is after waiting 20 minutes! The best part is I ordered a tea, up you read that right, a TEA. One cup of hot water with a tea bag took 20 minutes to prepare. That is just not acceptable on any level and management really needs to hire additional staff to handle the morning rush. Will definitely avoid at all costs.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x809142fe1bbce8c1:0x64862c0122e3115f< /gmapID></record>

Good service and tasty treats! I think you put some secret ingredient in that keeps us coming back and it's not caffeine because I drink decaf.

This specific Starbucks seems to have a lot more issues than others I've been to. From making wrong drinks, taking 10+ minutes to get drinks out, to forgetting to make a drink altogether. On top of that, the staff seems to be more abrasive than others. My drinks/charges seem to come out correct about half of the time.</review>

This specific Starbucks seems to have a lot more issues than others I've been to. From making wrong drinks, taking 10+ minutes to get drinks out, to forgetting to make a drink altogether. On top of that, the staff seems to be more abrasive than others. My drinks/charges seem to come out correct about half of the time.<//review>

This Starbucks literally always gives us problems with our drinks. Just now I ordered a Venti holiday caramel drink, which is literally 1/3 to 1/2 whipped cream. Most of the time I order a very simple drink--a Venti Americano (or pikes) with cream,and it is a true gamble as to whether the order is burned, inspired, or mixed up in some way. One time they gave me a black coffee with whipped cream, which I am shocked they think a human being that isn't a psychopath would order. My wife has already called the manager ok one time to express her frustration with the issues here, without requesting a replacement drink. We just want good coffee. We will be going to the other one across town now because this is a consistently poor performing Starbucks.<//review>

<review>The staff is unprofessional. I literally waited for the cashier to finish her conversation with her friends to take my order. The bathroom and sitting area hadn't been cleaned probably since it opened up that day. There were way too many kids working the day I was there to have customers waiting so long for their beverages. One of our orders was ice water (99 degrees in Merced) I had to go back to remind them to put ice in a cup, run water in it and hand it over. 1 star. Starbucks should be ashamed of this store.< /review>< username>

Everytime I come for a quick coffee, it is never quick. I sit in line for 20 minutes. They takes way too long to get customers through the line..<//text>

Stood in line, with no one else in front or behind me, for well over 3 minutes without even so much as a "We'll be right with you." I literally had to ask for acknowledgement. Not even an order, just to be acknowledged. They then "lost" my drink order. Gave me the wrong size and tried to give me the wrong drink. Let's just say service and quality drinks are not something you should look for at this location.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<review>🌟Starbucks American Loved.
Some would say they couldn't live without it.
I slide through the drive thu almost every morning before class or even work but The Starbucks ☕ on 360 W.16th St Merced, Cali has a bish ...yeah I said it a bish for Assitant Supervisor. *SOMEBODY CALL CORPORATE* If you don't like , hell love your job to the full extent THEN WHY DO IT!!! #CUSTOMER#SERVICE is most important #1. Very rude. Remember the customers and making them feel comfortable should be your main concern. Ppl skills, work ethics...Race, gender, religion should never be discriminated apon.< /review>< userid>

Worst Starbucks ever! Waited over 20 minutes maybe 25 in drive thru line! So ridiculous! I've been in other busier Starbuck's and they've got my drink in 5 or under! It ain't the 1st time we've had to wait for one drink either. They seem to take their sweeet time and play as well. My frapp lid was also loose, so my drink kept spilling all over hands. Never again will I go to that one.<//review>

Great service,  quality drinks. Can do better with their effort and customer-first focus. I recommend it,  but there definitely are better Starbucks locations with proper customer service</text>

One of the more shady Starbucks. Just needed to use the restroom and Internet while my tires got changed next-door. They treated me like a vagrant. Asked me if i was going to purchase something before giving me the restroom code. Is it because I walked? I've given plenty of money to Starbucks...maybe not that day, but really people? Other experiences have been ok that the reason for 3 stars.</review>

<review>Went and asked for a decaf Carmel frap. And whatever they made me was NOT a Carmel frap. It was more like a vanilla bean with Carmel on top. If I'm paying 5 damn dollars for a drink I would like if u can actually get my order right. Won't go there again ever such a waist of money!< /review>< pics>

I love this Starbucks spot because I've never had any problems. I drive thru here all The Time. The most frustrating thing that could happen to me on a drive thru is not getting what I  want or something in my order missing . When I'm rushing to work or somewhere else, the last thing I have Time for is going back to complain.  my experience on here has been flawless. Great team.</text>

Convenient Perfect stop on my way to wrk or out if town, they always busy. The staff doesn't really  listen to your order.  When you have free coupons double check your receipts.  2 out of 3 times charged for my drinks and they kept free coupon.< /text>

I am a regular and my coffee use to be great but for the past 2 months they either mess up my order or drink or it tastes like garbage.have had ask them to remake several times and have thrown away many drinks.. Now im forced to drive all the way across town just to have a good coffee.. Do not recommend this location.. Long wait times all just to recieve a nasty coffee.. Need to hire employees that actually know how to make coffee .<//Text>

It would have a 5 stars but Brandy gives horrible customer service. She served me in a very rude way. She slammed my money back in a bad way. Looks like she ain't even wants to work there. I always go there because the others employees are nice and kind to me.<//Review>

I love my Starbucks! Im not a coffee drinker, but love the Chai tea latte, whether I'm in the drive thru or inside the store, there is always a line. But it goes pretty quickly, and the employees are always friendly.</Review>

< Review>
My first time at this particular Starbucks and it sucked. There was a mistake with my drink ok no problem. The problem was after I told the lady about it her attitude went from sweet to sour real quick. I waited 15 mins in the drive thru just to get a simple frap with coconut milk.<//Review>

1. Afraid to get out of my car with the derelicts hanging around.
2. "Forgot to mix in the syrup, sorry." Says the barista.
3. Petite scones were soggy!!
4. Don't go here until Merced cleans up their act.
5. Not one customer before me, or behind me.<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>I dont usually do reviews, but for some reason whenever I come here my frappe always have a funny taste. I always order a Venti Carmel Frappe with extra caramel, but when it comes out there's barely any caramel. Taste plain and really water down. Waited 15mins for my order when it was really slow inside. Its weird because it only happens at this starbucks.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x809142fe1bbce8c1:0x64862c0122e3115f< /gmapID></record>

Staff is friendly, except for one girl that took my order she was rude. Has a drive thru. Homeless arent as bad as they were when it was located on main st. Interior is well done.<//text>

Online orders ordered 30 minutes earlier should not an 30 minutes to wait to pick up.  Terrible slow service!  I wouldn't say this if it was packed on a work day, totally opposite on a Saturday.😖<//text>

<Review>Very poor "customer service". Not everyone goes to starbucks all the time. Or maybe knows the meñu aswell as say the employees themselves, dont get ahead of yourselves and be snotty, or too lazy to greet the customer or explain what the product is. Very unsatisfied on the correction of a frapuccino. I asked for no caramel on one and it was packed with caramel, when corrected they did not add the coffee and made a plain vanilla shake for my wife.
*update
that was one bad experience. I have gone back multiple times and it seems they are doing a much better job now. Thank you! keep up the good work! sorry I had to give you a bad review before but you do deserve 5 stars now.</Review>< Pictures>

I really have a lot of different complaints and disappointments to post but now's not the time. It's too bad because this is the closest, most accessible starbux for my  location and the 6-7 different types of horrible service, treatment by staff and poorly made product would embarrass and infuriate me if I were a  CEO or  distrct/ regional manager of this company. Every time I order a drink its slow, tastes like some other drink and afterwards, when I need to remove the drink I purchased via restroom, I am confronted and told the restroom is only for customers! What a smack in the face. Ignorant, cocky, judgmental, Snobbish and lazy cafe preparers is how I must report of this most unsatisfactory experience with an American favorite. They need a course in work ethics, learn empathy for their variety of customers and start paying attention to who just bought a $4.75 Grande 45 minutes prior before threatening the wrong person to not use the facilities unless "u hurry up and buy." Last note* if u are in a hurry to get a fast cup of Joe before work, etc., I suggest getting a McCafe if you don't have 30-45 minutes to spare...  maybe I will,try one last visit and I'm guessing I will take off another star on the rating above😔sad but 🤔true...<//Review>

Staff was not helpful nor friendly.  We visited about 25-minutes before closing.  The staff was more concerned about getting their chores done than helping customers.  I ordered a venti dark roast, which was unavailable, but waited 18-minutes for the staff to complete my order.  During my wait I needed to use the bathroom, which I told was locked because they just cleaned it.  15-minutes later, after some begging, I was given a piece of paper with a code to the restroom lock. When I received my order, it was served in a grande (smaller) cup.  (I paid for a venti).  I don't think Merced is ready for the Starbucks experience.</review>

The service was extremely slow. I was in the drive thru for nearly 30 min and when I got received my drinks one was incorrect. After waiting for so long already I just took what I got.<//text>

Staff is disorganized and don't handle crowds very well, seem to pick and choose who gets served first,  I love their Matcha green tea, but it's frustrating to have to wait 30 minutes for it< /Review>
