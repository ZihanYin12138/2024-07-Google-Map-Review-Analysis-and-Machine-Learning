My first visit to this breathtaking venue was last week 20 May 2021 for a truly beautiful wedding. The happy couple chose this place wisely. The views were lovely. The on-site staff were super friendly and helpful and attentive. Only complaint: the waitstaff could use a lot of training about clearing tables.
The ceremony was outside with a view of the neighbouring vineyard as was the cocktail area.
The dining room was a great size and opened up into a couple of courtyards. There were picturesque spots and staged seating areas with chandeliers all over the grounds. It was so well thought out.
We eat and danced and laughed and celebrated with adorable bride and groom until the evening.   It couldn’t have been a better day if we tried! Well done, Villa de Amore!</review>

We are so happy to have chosen Villa De Amore as our venue to celebrate our wedding and reception.  Elegant, beautiful, and joy-filled is how I'd explain and alway remember our experience. From the moment we arrived to the sweet finish of the grand exit, we were catered to and cared for.

The property is beautiful, and despite being early season for a wedding, the grounds and surrounding vineyards presented themselves majestically. The rolling hills and blue skies painted the perfect backdrop for our nuptials, followed by a glorious sunset into night for cake cutting and dancing. The vendors Villa De Amore works with are also fantastic! 5 stars is not enough. Exceptional.< /Text>

Absolutely beautiful wedding venue!!! My fiance and I are so excited to get married here next year. We looked at a lot of winery venue options and Villa was the best option due to offering an "all-inclusive" package where you pay a fixed rate and it comes with florals, food, cake, DJ, etc - but also the length of time they give you at the venue, allowing you to serve any alcohol you choose, as well as the absolutely stunning grounds - every square inch of this place is gorgeous!! Look no further for a wedding venue in Temecula!<//review>

I was a bridesmaids recently and man I don’t even know where to start. I understand due to Covid there are restrictions and precautions in place but they didn’t cancel the wedding instead they made false promises they couldn’t keep. Literally after taking thousands and thousands of dollars they stated verbally and in writing they could still fulfill the contract. The day of my friends wedding they broke their promises after the couple said I do at venue. Plan B had been arranged at the brides home But they refused to deliver the food as originally promised and send their catering team which they also promised. They  just placed all the prepared food into the bridal parties cars and called it a day with no instructions or guidance. We had to serve food to the 50 guests and clean up. It was a mess. Shame on them for taking all of that money and not fulfilling their duty. The venue is beautiful but man the customer service and professionalism is truly horrifying. During these challenging times, the way business conduct themselves shows how much they care for their reputation and customer. I’m truly disgusted at how they treated the bride and groom. Stay away!< /Text>

<text>The view was nice. if we could enjoy the press press grape juice, it would be nicer. The reception was much better than the dinner. Dinner was awful. The photographers only care about the shooting with families instead of friends joining.<//text>< Pictures>

It's a shame for a venue that prides itself as a family business and making brides experiences as stress free as possible (all inclusive) has gained a reputation for being inflexible and uncompromising during COVID. On top of the agony and stress that planning a wedding during a pandemic brings, the venue refused to allow us to change our date for late 2021 unless we paid them an additional $4k. CA state health laws currently prohibits wedding receptions, and 2021 will still be mark with added uncertainties; however it seems they are unwilling to adapt to the current circumstances and choose to shift the costs to it's customers. I spoken to other venues who have modified their pricing or are willing to work with customers to customize an experience for them. Not VDA. It makes perfect sense now why their Google search rating dropped from a 4.8 to a 4.2. Don't waste your time entertaining this place for a wedding, there are better managed vineyards in Temecula that won't rob you of your time and money!!!< /text>

By far the WORST! My friend got married about 2 weeks ago and it was nothing but headaches with Villa de Amore. They are dishonest and did not provide the services they had agreed to provide. They tried canceling on her the day before the wedding and then canceled her reception the day of the wedding! Leaving us, the bridal party to run the show. We had to serve the guest food, pick up, and find a last minute bar tender. Such a disappointment. Avoid yourself the headache and find some place else that will keep their word.< /text>

Future brides and grooms, RUN and DO NOT look back!! I like to echo all the couples who had a horrible experience with Villa De Amore during this time. My husband and I were supposed to get married in late June and of course, that did not happen because of the pandemic. Your wedding is supposed to be the happiest and joyful event in your life, however, dealing with Eileen and David during this pandemic was nothing, but STRESS and HEADACHES. They claim to be a family owned business, but unfortunately, all they care about is money!

We reached out to Villa De Amore in March of 2020, three months before our wedding, expressing our concerns about if our wedding was going to happen in June. If it was not going to happen as it states in our contract, we were looking for a refund and not a postponement.
David stated that he did not know if they could have our wedding, but told us to wait until 30 days prior to our wedding date for his decision. We had also asked if they would honor their force majeure in their contact, and at the time, David said their insurance would review our claim. This gave us hope that would honor this clause in our contract.  As the days and months went by, cases of Covid continued to rise and it didn’t look like we would be able to hold our wedding. In May, a few days before we hit the 30-day mark, I called Riverside County and they confirmed with me that NO businesses were allowed to conduct weddings at that time. I also called a few wineries in Temecula, and ALL of them said they have already postponed or refunded all their couples. Once again, I reached out to David and Eileen about what Riverside County and other wineries had said and done, but again, they said they do not know whether they could hold our wedding and also added, that they WILL NOT refund our money and that our only option is to choose an undesirable date for the future (in my opinion). Our wedding is a destination wedding for us and the majority of our guests, so we were not going to risk their safety in having our wedding there. What was even worse, was that two weeks prior to our wedding, Eileen had the nerve to email us and said that they got the okay to hold our wedding and send them our final count. As we all know now and back then, we were clearly still in the middle of the pandemic, and weddings were still not allowed at that time! At this point, we knew we could not trust them. During this time, they did nothing, but misled us with false information and acted as if they were above the law as they decided not to listen to the state and county orders. We clearly DID NOT continue our business with them and hired a lawyer. In July, we were notified that Villa De Amore had a Temporary Restraining Order from Riverside County stating that they were to stop holding, offering, and hosting wedding receptions. Also that the court finds that Villa De Amore was an immediate threat to the public’s health.

Take your hard-earned money elsewhere, because they sure do not care about you, your family, and your friend’s safety! If I could go back in time, I WOULD NEVER have trusted Villa De Amore to have my once and lifetime wedding. You deserve better!!<//Review>

A friend of mine's wedding had to be cancelled due to COVID. The same complaints as everyone else. Would not let them cancel, had to reschedule. Gave them a weekday date and said that their prices went up so they refuse to give a partial refund even though their new date is on a WEEKDAY. I feel  awfulf the bride and she is trying to stay positive but this company is being ridiculous.<//text>

I ordained a wedding here and would never perform another wedding at this site EVER AGAIN. They were beyond unprofessional and what they did to the couple when I was there is absolutely unforgivable.  They stopped reception services and left the newlyweds to figure out what to do with flowers, table set up, food and service. They turned whats supposed to be a blessed day for newlyweds into a nightmare. If you don't want to do the service then close your venue!!! I only give a one star because its a beautiful location and I can't give anything less on here.</text>< pics>

I wish I could give no stars for how horrible this place is treating my friends. Having COVID already and then not being able to reschedule your dream wedding and lose ALL your money is unheard of. How can you have no compassion in this already horrible time? They have tried everything to work with you and you act with zero empathy. How can you work in weddings? This should be the best time in a couples lives, it is a global pandemic and you are worse than the virus.

Please try and explain yourself. No one should ever get married here. I am so sad for all the couples you are doing this too.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>When I see 5 star reviews, my expectations already start high, so I was expecting 5 star service, but what this place delivered was beyond that. You’d think if a business did the same thing over and over again, they may get complacent or “go through the motions” which is the vibe I got from some other venues I’ve seen, but from this place…never…not ONCE.
The moment I stepped foot on the beautiful grounds, I was in love. Even on a rainy day, the villa was breathtaking.  The owner, Elaine was super sweet, and excited to be taking me on this tour. When she was talking about her family run business (daughter and son in law in charge of catering and son is the manager) she was just bursting with enthusiasm. She was excited when she was talking about the endless inventory she acquires almost weekly to help decorate the grounds for your wedding day… then, we even shared a teary moment together when I talked about my day. This. Was. It.
Then the cost… all inclusive!! Photography, cake, flowers, decorations, decor, day of coordinator (who is absolutely the best by the way), wedding design, catering, bar tenders, servers, officiant, DJ, linens, all covered!!! You will not be disappointed in their amazing choice in vendors.
The Food.. AMAZING? We expected the food to be great but we were BLOWN away with how yummy it all was. We settled on Steak and Swordfish for our entrees and Shrimp Sliders, crab deviled eggs and a cheese display for appetizers. All my guests are still telling me how much they loved those Shrimp sliders. When they placed my husband's steak in front of him and my swordfish it was HUGE. That rarely happens to get amazing food and huge portions. I made SURE I ate it. Laura, the wedding day of coordinator (did I mention she’s the absolute best) was clear to make sure we knew we had 10 minutes to eat before the next thing.. so I definitely ate mine and some of my husband’s. She made sure we always had something to drink and was catering to our every need without us even having to ask her to, she literally just knew.
I don't have enough room to mention each vendor individually even though I want to, so I'll just say the florist, photographer, the DJ, the cake baker, were all on point and amazing. I did separate reviews on their websites if you want to check it out!
Bar- You can bring your own drinks! They serve them, but you bring them saving you money. I absolutely loved the way the showed off my signature drinks. The bartender stopped what he was doing when the bride needed a drink! He also ran, yes ran, when he didn’t have any apple cider at the bar and I wanted a pre-toast with my Jr. Bridesmaids.
Bury the Bourbon-We had a tradition we wanted to do where we bury the bourbon on the property one month before the wedding and to prevent it from raining on your wedding day. Our wedding was in February, it was very possible. Most venues said it wasn’t allowed. Villa’s reaction? They loved the idea. They were excited to participate in something new. Not only did they let us bury it, but they had a table and shot glasses ready to go for us when we dug it up. It was a bright 82 degrees in Feb!
Laura was there checking in on me before the wedding, grabbed all my belongings and gifts, she even ensured I had my flats when my feet hurt.
It was undoubtedly the best day of my life and I wish I could relive it over and over again. The team of people the Villa pulled together went beyond my expectations and I was already expecting a lot.<//text>< gmap_id>

Would give zero stars if I could. My friend had her wedding planned for this venue for August 2020 and after coming to several agreements they failed her miserably. They are horrible at communication. They even had the audacity to ask her to cancel on the day of her rehearsal, even though there was a contract. Their website is not user-friendly when trying to set up event for guest to RSVP. For the price you would expect better from this place.<//review>

Absolutely just horrible, no compassion, no sympathy, no heart.< /review></record>

<rate>1</rate><review>Do not book this venue. They have been absolutely horrible to our friends and have taken complete advantage of many couples due to COVID. If having your wedding canceled isn’t devastating enough, having a venue that doesn’t care about its couples makes it a million times worse. Our friends had a premium weekend booked and were only offered the option to rebook on a weekday in 2021. For many reasons, including that they and most of their family live out of state, this wouldn’t work. The venue has been heartless and has refused to provide them a refund of any sort, despite language in the original contract that stated a refund would be offered if the venue had to cancel. Please save yourself the heartache and avoid booking with this money hungry venue.<//review>< pictures>

Envisioning your big day, comes with the fairy tale most little girls have grown up with. In the case of my friend booking her dream wedding, it went from dream wedding to nightmare. This venue decided that since none of the dates for changing the original date worked for Villa De Amore because of COVID-19, they would just take her ENTIRE deposit. This venue is not cheap, and could be upward of $35,000+. To think that a venue could take a bride and grooms deposit given the current circumstance is beyond disgusting. The saddest part is not only are they taking brides deposits that had booked dates for during lockdown, their probably also receiving state assistance, which means their making out like bandits!

I support family owned businesses that are truthful and support the working class, not PROFIT during a pandemic by taking a bride and groom's life savings for their own financial gain.<//review>

<review>Soon to be brides, RUN. I think business owners through the country's true colors really show with how they acted and treated people during the horrible time of COVID. Villa De Amore in particular, is taking tens of thousands of dollars from their future and current couples through this unprecedented time without offering them any future dates for postponements, and even refusing to refund those who's weddings have already unfortunately passed and could not be held. If you want to trust the people holding your money for your wedding day, please look elsewhere for your own sanity and be sure to ask your prospective venue what they did for their couples during the time of COVID-19. It will speak volumes to their character!< /review></record></dataset><record>

This is a beutiful venue in the heart of Temecula vineyards fields, the staff is professional and helpful. My son wedding was awesome, the dance hall has bad sound but the DJ is cool, the location doesn't has directional signs so your guests can lost. The catering was excelent and the barman is nice.< /Text>

My fiancé and I paid in full to be married at Villa de Amore on April 5th, 2020- which obviously could not legally happen due to the global pandemic we are currently still enduring. The managers of this venue, Eileen Rivard and David Musser would not allow us to postpone or even reduce our guest count (which was 204 people) until Riverside county legally prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people to take place. This was only a few short weeks before our wedding. We pleaded with the owners to compromise; a staggering number of our guests were sending us regretful messages that they could not risk their lives by attending our wedding during this terrifying pandemic on a daily basis. They had no concern or sympathy for our loved ones safety- “it’s business as usual” they said.

When they were forced by law to cancel our special day, they proceeded to offer a limited amount of undesirable dates, most of which would still be plagued with our current situation and some of which were so far out we could not wait. My fiancé’s father was suffering from terminal illness, we needed to book a date that was far enough out for him and our other guests to be safe, but not too far as we feared his illness would take him from us before he was able to attend our wedding.

We hesitantly considered a date in august, and in response they immediately pressured us to sign new contracts. I made sure to review them to ensure the “force majeure” clause was present, as I was under the impression it was the only part of the original contract that protected us if this were to happen again. While going back and fourth with Eileen, I was confused about one of the first lines in the contract that addressed our refund if the anticipated amount of guests could not attend. She quickly responded that she would re-word that line to make it more clear, and a few minutes later she sent a new contract. I later found that she removed the force majeure clause, surely hoping we would have good faith that she only changed the part she claimed she would change and sign the contract without noticing.

At this point we felt massively violated. I felt these people could not be trusted. We needed to re plan our wedding quickly to ensure our beloved father could attend. We asked for the refund that their contract clearly stated we deserved, and that’s when they stopped responding all together. We emailed them constantly, and finally had no choice but to hire a lawyer. To our shock they also failed to respond to multiple correspondence from our attorney. They were well aware what we had to lose, and they were taking full advantage of it. When their lawyer responded to our attorney, the letter set forth, in my opinion, arguments that insinuated we could have foreseen COVID19 coming when we booked our wedding in May of 2019.  To me, the letter was almost as disgraceful as the venue.

We are now in the unfortunate position of having to file a lawsuit against Villa de Amore to get our money back. They claimed they were unable to refund because they needed our money to pay their staff and utilities while they have been closed and not hosting weddings. I’m curious how they planned to host our wedding on the new date they tried to have us change into if they already spent all of our money.

Our father passed away approximately two weeks ago. We are devastated that he wasn’t able to witness our wedding that we are sure he extended his life well past his prognosis for. It’s all he could talk about and he declined very quickly after it was cancelled. In my opinion, Villa de Amore made it difficult for us to plan a new wedding elsewhere in time for him to be there, and there are no words to describe our devastation over this situation.

It’s painful to re-live this experience that continues to cause us hurt and sleepless nights. I would never wish what we have been through on anyone.< /review>

We must write a CURRENT review about how well-pleased we were with Villa de Amore in every way.  My wife and daughter found this venue for our daughter’s wedding; and each of us were so impressed with the care and consideration that went into the layout of the facility and grounds, its overall design and décor, unique offer to stylize our wedding by using their stocked warehouse of design elements, convenience of the all-inclusive package, and warm inviting environment created here by everything from lighting to staff service …they simply didn’t miss a thing!

We placed a deposit well in advance to secure a date we wanted as they can get booked-up fast each year.  However, with recent (seeming) day-to-day changes in government rulings brought on by the Covid concern, when getting down to the actual event date, it seemed as though the government edict may indeed ruin our wedding plans.  In the face of the mess of rules related to Covid; the staff, and business owner were required to consider immediate compliance, and took quick legal counsel to interpret rulings and then determine how to best serve our needs.  Eileen (the owner) came up with a few options for how to handle this, and we were very comforted by her fight on our behalf, to make this special wedding day a reality for us personally, even against the obstacles placed before her.  She made certain all governmental concerns were addressed and provided a compliant event that went through without a hitch even though it initially appeared we may be required to cancel.  We cannot praise Eileen enough for her not only professional, but personal touch in getting involved specifically in our event to make it successful and above and beyond our expectation.  She was accommodating in every way; and if she were an uncaring business owner, could have simply let the chips fall where they may, as our event was a holiday weekend, and she could have easily avoided the headache and taken a vacation as most people do on holiday’s.  Instead, she watched over all aspects of our wedding from morning to evening, along with her coordinator and staff to make certain our guests were treated well and the event was a hit…all of our attendees became fans of Villa de Amore this day, some saying they have not attended a more beautiful venue, ever.

Let me say, we are not push-overs and would not unnecessarily gush about the staff if we did not receive phenomenal service from the owner all the way through to staff servers, all of whom were polite, warm, and friendly with all requests.  Even the food served was exceptional (as the father of the bride) I was able to request and eat two dinners myself, and both options were wonderful, with their own individual merit and flavor profile, thanks to their chef/co-owner Michael.

We will not only refer our friends and relatives to this facility as very, very, happy patrons; but desire to let you folks in the public also know that the owner and staff can be trusted, as they provided an extraordinary and forever memorable experience for us!  Do not hesitate to visit and strongly consider Villa de Amore as the perfect spot for your gathering, you will not be disappointed!

David Marine, on behalf of our family

This place screwed my friends over for their wedding, which they couldn’t have on the date of their contract due to COVID. They took all of their deposits and are not refunding any of it even though their contract says full refunds will be made in case of natural disasters and the venue’s inability to host the event. Very disheartening to see them want to save their business on others’ expense. Stay away from them!<//review>

<Text>Villa de Amore is taking tens of thousands of dollars from couples and refusing to let them cancel or reschedule their weddings, which are not able to happen because of COVID. They offered my friend the option to reschedule a for a weekday in January for an extra $10,000. It’s ludicrous, cruel, and a bad move. Think twice before booking this venue because this is how they treat their clients.</Text><userid>114599105832752742967< /userid>< date>

<text>Location - Its a bit distant from the typical main stip of all the Temecula wine country but not too bad.

Venue  - Very cool venue with multiple area's to hang out and hold different parts of events or wedding parts.

Parking - Plenty of parking from what I seen but we ended Ubering so didn't have a problem.

Drinks  - We had a open bar for a friends wedding so that was amazing.

Service - The staff here is very nice and friendly and always trying to make sure everyone is happy.

Came here for my friends wedding and its a beautiful location with great views and areas for pictures.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I had my wedding here this past September and we couldn't have chosen a better venue. They they care of everything for you! Their all-inclusive package made life so much easier. Monique, Laura and Aimee pay so much attention to detail so you don't have to stress. I am forever thankful for the amazing staff that made our wedding the best day of our lives!</Review>

My wife and I just had our wedding here and let me start by saying the place is beautiful in general and most was pretty good but the fact of how much we paid and the venue completely messed up everyone’s dinner after we already confirmed everything and yet they still screwed up the food. We told Aimee the manager of catering said she would take care of it then never came back or said anything. To add to that they ran out of potatoes and served our guests French fries. are you kidding me 35k dollars for French fries and completely destroy our wedding. Now let’s add to it, so they never say anything try and push it under the rug and we call and the owners daughter tells us “I’m sorry this only happened 2x and it was 5 years ago” “I’ll send you guys a gift card for dinner”......it’s almost comical how much of a joke that is for the amount we paid to have those critical errors done and then offer an effing gift card....now let’s add to it it’s been two weeks and  have yet to hear or receive anything...it’s not acceptable at all for money they get paid....if those mistakes weren’t made the night would have been great but thank you villa de amore for making our once in a lifetime day to be remembered and talked about for something else! Good job!< /review>

Stop looking and book this venue!! They are absolutely amazing and make everything so flawless and beautiful! They are all inclusive, and to be honest, at first I was kind of worried about that. I was scared that everything that was included was going to be extremely basic and anything additional would be an upgrade. WRONG! They truly include everything and it turns out gorgeous and extremely convenient. For example, I found a lot of other venues were charging money for individual pieces you would want to use to decorate (like mirrors, couches, card boxes, etc.). At Villa De Amore that is all included. They have a HUGE room of different pieces you get to go through and chose from for your decor and set up. My guest were in 'aw' of the locations beauty, professionalism, flexibility, and food!! They are family owned and have a list of preferred vendors, all in which are so easy and fun to work with. You don't have to lift a finger in decorating, set up, or clean up. You just tell them your vision and wants for the day and they make it happen. Not to mention they all have such a calm and sweet demeanor. There was a good chance of rain on our wedding day, so the day before they ran me threw the different options in case of that and let me explain my vision if that did happen and make me feel so confident and comfortable that they had everything handled to a T. I cannot thank them enough for giving us truly the perfect day and making this process not a stress at all. I feel bad when brides are sick with stress over planning because my venue took care of all that and I just got to enjoy the entire process. I LOVE this venue.< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>We could not have been happier with the Villa. This all inclusive venue was the perfect setting for our twin daughters double wedding! Having a double wedding can be tricky....there were some special logistics that needed to be worked out with the photography, the ceremony and the reception. The folks at the Villa De Amore were more than accommodating. Laura, the 'Day of Coordinator' was wonderful to work with and kept everything pretty close to schedule. She was calm and organized. You will fall in love with Eileen, the owner, she is one of a kind and the vendors that she has surrounds herself with are top notch and work very hard to make sure you are happy. One of our favorites, was the florist, we couldn't have been happier, Sheila was amazing and the flowers were beautiful! David at the Villa, was my main contact for questions/concerns...he was very responsive to my many inquiries. I highly recommend if you want a stress free wedding, (or as close to a stress free wedding as you can get) book the Villa!</Review>< user_name>

I was a guest at a wedding held at this venue.   It was a beautiful wedding and well planned.   The grounds were well kept and the staff seemed friendly.  My only complaint was the food.   The portions were huge but the steak was so overcooked and tuff that it was inedible.  My entire table was disappointed in the meal.  Luckily street tacos were served later in the evening.   They were delicious.</Review>

<Review>At $125 per guest you'd expect a respectful photographer and a well cooked meal. Instead the photographer bossed people around like she was herding cows and the steak should have been sold as jerky. Never again.<//Review></record>

We had our wedding at Villa de Amore on June 22, 2019 and it was *literally* the best day of our lives.

Working with everyone at the Villa was so easy and so much fun. From the designing process (with Monique who brought my entire vision to life) to the catering (the food was seriously incredible), and everyone the day of the wedding (Laura the coordinator who is FANTASTIC) and DJ Ross (who created such memorable, perfectly-timed moments for us), we couldn’t have asked for anything better.

We were looking at venues in Temecula and Santa Barbara, and nothing that we saw anywhere else compared with the Villa. David, the owner, really showed us his vision for the venue during our initial walk through and explained the process, which just solidified how we felt about the property at first glance. We used all of their recommended vendors, who were equally amazing (shout out to The Studio by LMP, VDA Floral and Elegance on Display)!

The best part of the Villa is that you don’t need to hire an event planner or drive yourself crazy during the planning process. Every staff member and vendor they work with knows the venue inside and out which makes things SO much easier and stress-free.

All of our family and friends had an equally incredible time at our wedding – calling it the “most beautiful” and “most fun” wedding they’ve ever been to.

If you’re looking for a venue in Southern California, you NEED to check out Villa de Amore. We had family travel in from the East Coast, who were just blown away with the beauty of the venue and the surrounding areas, and everyone who traveled from Los Angeles was equally impressed.

There’s a reason the Villa is quickly becoming one of the top wedding venues in the country – seriously, don’t wait to check this place out!< /Text>

Once you arrive you too will know this is the place to have your wedding at. Everyone is very friendly and more than helpful with any and every question you may have through out planning your wedding. They pour their passion for weddings into every detail through out this place! It is the Disney of all weddings. They are always updating with what is current and are always making sure the place looks brand new. The staff during the day of the wedding are fabulous, not to mention the day of coordinator is a lifesaver. I had one big issue before my wedding which was the zipper on my dress split open from top to bottom and she was on top of finding a sewing kit to make my day every bit of what I had dreamed it would be. You should not pass up the chance to pick this place for your wedding venue!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>The Villa did the most amazing job. We missed our own rehearsal because we forgot to get our marriage license earlier in the week. We are from Iowa so it was a little nerve wrecking not knowing exactly what the villa looked like but it ended up being just perfect! We got to choose specific details a few days before and everyone was eager to meet with us. They were flexible with planning and always got back to me. I had a TON of questions and they always made me feel important and like my opinion mattered. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Mark Lohman was our officiant and he was awesome! The planner Laura definitely knew what she was doing and helped calm my nerves. Amazing staff and beautiful grounds!< /review>< Pics>

I'm not sure there are words that can describe how grateful I am for everyone at Villa de Amore. They truly made my wedding day dreams come true. Their entire staff is incredible and each of them do their job so well. My wedding went as smoothly as expected. I highly recommend this venue to any bride in the area. Looking forward to seeing all of them again when we return for our 1 year anniversary next year! XO< /text>

<Review>Villa De Amore will not only create your dream wedding they will take the stress out of wedding planning. They take care of everything down to the tiniest detail with such care and personalization. Exquisite style, sensational cuisine, and incredible attention to detail  were  flawlessly orchestrated on our wedding day.
Our guests enjoyed the breathtaking views, gorgeous ambiance in an elegant, romantic, and private atmosphere.

I do plenty of research before I buy anything and our wedding day was no exception.  Living in Orange County I looked all around southern California for the perfect venue. I thought I was going to have to lower my standards when asking for price quotes but my prayers were answered when I found Villa De Amore. I couldn't believe that a place this perfect could be this all inclusive and affordable.

When Patrick proposed there was no question in my mind where we needed to visit, Villa De Amore was my first choice and when we met the owner Eileen it was last venue. You enter their grounds you are swept away with how beautiful it is, no picture does it justice. Then their team bring your dreams to life and puts your worries at ease. I couldn't ask for a better experience. They have everything there!

When we moved from California to Pennsylvania we had to do most of  the wedding planing via phone and email. The entire team got everything right without stress or going over budget.

My words could never express how much gratitude I have for Villa De Amore. From day one the journey to our wedding day was a pleasure. I'm not sure what bride can truthfully say that but I was sad when the planning was over. Villa created the perfect wedding day for us. I have so much love for the team that when above and beyond in creating our dream day. From the bottom of my heart thank you!!</Review>< pictures>

<Review>This Venue is a MUST!!!!! If you are looking for the WHOLE package - LOOK! NO! FURTHER! We could not have had a better experience! From day one everyone was so helpful and oh so amazing with every aspect of our Wedding! It was such an amazing experience! Our wedding was truly a Fairy tale, something straight out of a story book!!! We could not have had done it without the amazing people at the Villa - Eileen, David, Aimee, Monique and Laura. Our Guests are still talking about how Breathtaking the Venue is, how delicious the Food was, and the service was out of this world!! One of the Best weddings they have ever been to!

We truly do feel like we are now part of this amazing family (The Villa). As a Bride and a control freak - I felt so confident and at ease that my day was in such great hands. Laura was my coordinator and everything went just so perfectly! I couldn't have had done it better myself. Monique - my designer set every little thing that I had requested and wanted for our wedding with such grace and thought, that everyone thought I had done it all.

This was the First Venue we looked at, and after just looking at one more Venue, we were back with our Deposit check. Another great thing about the Villa is, that you can bring in your own alcohol! That's right!!! It will not cost you an arm and a leg to have a premium OPEN BAR! If that doesn't make you want to get married here...I don't what would!

I can just go on and on about how FABULOUS our wedding was...but I think you should experience it all at Villa de Amore yourselves!</Review>< date>

The Villa de Amore is phenomenal. I had my wedding ceremony/reception at the Villa in Temecula and loved the whole process.  Not only is the venue absolutely beautiful, the venue is very private, unlike the wineries. Laura was the wedding planner for my big day and was sooo easy to work with and accommodating. The value is there.  Every detail at the Villa is so carefully thought out. I really believe my wedding has been the best wedding I have been to thanks to the staff at the Villa...nothing will compare!<//text>

Dave, Aimee, Eileen, Lauren, etc. with Villa de Amore were FANTASTIC, AMAZING, FLEXIBLE, HELPFUL, AFFORDABLE, etc. I really truly cannot say enough about our experience with those folks.

Venue - located in Temecula, California, about 45 min from San Diego. Needless to say, the venue is stunningly beautiful. Imagine a breathtakingly beautiful mansion on a hill with vineyards, a customized altar, a huge patio, personal dance floor, etc. - that's what you get with the villa.

Convenient - During our engagement, my husband was in Washington DC, I was in Canada, and the wedding was in California. As such, you can imagine how difficult wedding planning could be... However, it could not have been much easier, to be honest. When you meet with the villa, they give you the caterer, a choice of florists, photographers, ministers, DJ, etc etc etc. Literally all you need to do as the bride is worry about the guest list and your dress. All the vendors they allow you to choose from are professional, talented and "go out of our way" helpful.

Affordable - The fee is per guest - no hidden costs. When we did the math, they were even more affordable than other venues that you have to do piece by piece. Not only do you already have a group of vendors (cater, photo, DJ, minister, etc), but the pricing is even more affordable!

Soiree Florists - Sheila and her team over there are phenomenal. I honestly could not have made the flowers and decorations more beautiful if I tried. I told Sheila I knew nothing about flowers and just told her a group of colors. She got creative with it and on the day of the wedding, I was just blown away with the color, the styling, the artful taste - it was all amazing.

Ken Pollard - Minister - I can not say enough nice things about Ken. The man probably marries 2 couples a week - however, he still managed to make our ceremony so touching and customized to Luke and I. I don't doubt that he will be a part of our lives forever.

Overall, A++!< /Text>

This venue is absolutely beautiful! You get the gorgeous vineyard scenery you would with a winery but with more privacy and an intimate feel.  All inclusive package was definitely worth it. Our wedding was exactly what we wanted and hassle free, both during planning and the day of.  Everything ran like clockwork during our wedding day.  The staff was amazingly professional and attentive. The food was great.  DJ Ross and especially his photobooth were great. His wife manned the booth and helped with pictures and made us a cute album with all the photobooth printouts. All the vendors were amazing and in the end they all worked together wonderfully. We can't say enough good things about this place!!  Thank you to Eileen and David and the rest of the staff at Villa de Amore for everything!!<//Text>

FIRST I WANT TO SAY IT IS A BEAUTIFUL VENUE IN WINE COUNTRY,   BUT  HOT HOT HOT.   THIS PLACE IS LOCATED IN TEMECULA WHERE THERE ARE MANY MANY HOTS DAYS.   THEY ARE VERY POORLY EQUIPPED TO HANDLE HOT DAYS.  WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM (85-90)  FOR THEIR AIR CONDITIONING UNIT TO COOL IT OFF. LOOKED LIKE A 5 TON UNIT OUTSIDE TO ME.   IT WAS 104 DEGREES OUT AND THE GROOMS MOTHER PASSED OUT. SO IF YOU KNOW IT IS GOING TO BE 100+ DEGREES THE OWNER SHOULD  HAVE TURNED ON THE AIR AT NOON AND LET THE PLACE GET COLD.  THEY ALSO RAN OUT OF THE ENTREE WE CHOOSE. BY THE TIME OUR TABLE WAS CALLED NEITHER MY HUSBAND OR MYSELF  GOT THE STEAK ENTREE THAT WE ORDERED .  NONE OF THIS IS ANY REFLECTION ON THE BRIDE, ONLY THE VENUE.  IF I WERE TO BOOK THIS PLACE FOR ANYTIME DURING THE SUMMER OF FALL I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTRACT STATED AIR CONDITIONING.  WOMEN BATHROOM WAS SO HOT IT WAS STIFELING.THEY COULD AT LEAST HAVE PLACED A FAN INSIDE.</review>

<review>I could not ever possibly give this venue or the amazing people that work there and with them, anything less than five stars. Everything was absolutely amazing from the moment my husband and I stepped foot on the property to take our tour. I am much of a procrastinator unfortunately, and the villa helped me in any and every way possible that I could imagine without any hesitation or rudeness all the way to the very last minute of the night. My necklace broke while we were taking pictures in the vineyard and they took the necklace and did everything they could to fix it, which I thought was beyond repair, before we even went back out to be introduced as bride and groom. It's little things like that, as well as the major things obviously, that made this venue special. My husband and I still talk about the wedding as well as still hear about it from guests numerous guests. It was the most amazing/beautiful day and venue, I wouldn't have done it any other way. Thanks so much, Dave and the Villa family.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80db79301a119111:0xfcc118c0736d662<//GmapID></record>

My husband and I had our wedding at Villa de Amore, and it was the most absolutely beautiful wedding I could have ever imagined. Everything from the wedding coordination, to the small details that made the day truly ours was just a dream. The design team really was able to get into my head and create a vision that embodied both our styles, and felt completely personal to us. The wedding coordinator, Laura, is absolutely AMAZING! She is seriously such a sweetheart, and did everything to make the day seamless and worry-free. No matter what I needed, she was there in a minute. We had a groomsman pop a button off his tux, she was there to fix it. I had forgotten to request sparkling cider at certain tables, and right before the toast she had it served to my guests. I mean literally anything we needed, she was there. The photographers were absolutely wonderful as well. They had everything down to a science, even exact times of when to take photos during the exact moment of sunset! I mean this place is a well-oiled machine. The food...OMG it was to die for. I love the fact that everything is locally grown too. :) Seriously I still have guests raving about the food. I loved everything about my experience, and wish I could have my wedding all over again because I had the time of my life! I am so thankful I looked online and found Villa de Amore. It was everything I could have ever wanted and more. :)< /text>

<review>ATTENTION ALL BRIDES WHO WANT TO HAVE THE MOST PERFECT AND MAGICAL WEDDING EVER:

Prior to my wedding, my husband and I were overwhelmed with all of the researching and planning that went into our special day. Let me help save you time when it comes to finding the PERFECT wedding venue/team of vendors (they provide almost all vendors that you could need-it is a packaged deal!) who do not make you break the bank! The entire staff/team are just the best-in every way-am I am super picky and meticulous.

The beauty of their magical/unique/fairytale esque vineyard speaks for itself. The premise is absolutely breathtaking all throughout the year (we visited various times throughout the year and got married on April 1st). Their food is an experience all on its own. Everything is organic, made on site (by Aimee who is the best!) and dangerously delicious! The entire menu (we tried so many different options at the tasting session) is fabulous and they come in super plentiful portions at the tasting and on the wedding day. At the risk of sounding redundant, the service was exceptional! Beyond anything I could have hoped for. You DO NOT need a wedding coordinator because their Venue coordinator does EVERYTHING (way more than what "venue coordinators" typically do). Her name is Laura and she is fabulous, super communicative and genuinely cares about you having the best day ever. Decor-they have a fantasy prop room with everything and anything you could possibly want to achieve any type of genre/look/feeling. Monique is in charge of creating your vision/aesthetics throughout the entire premise and she has impeccable taste and a total sweetheart. Flowers-spit your vision out to Eileen (a complete doll!!) and she will bring it to life in the most beautiful way possible! Ross-fun, professional, sweet experienced DJ who will show your guests a great time!

Eileen (owner) and David are so patient and communicative and amazing for running this place and being available whenever we needed them!

I love Villa de Amore!!!!

<Review>I don't even know where to begin, so I will start from the beginning.  Villa de Amore was the fifth and final venue we looked at in our search for the perfect place to get married.  We loved the vineyard feel without the commercial feel of the wineries and that was the problem with the golf course as well we didn't want our wedding to be a spectacle for strangers to gawk at.  The grounds are absolutely beautiful and private everything is picturesque any picture you look at from the Villa will tell you the same.  The Villa is in the business of weddings and they know what they are doing. All of our vendors came recommended by Villa de Amore, we felt more comfortable hiring them because they were backed by the venue and they did not disappoint.  The in house catering done by Aimee and her team was/is absolutely amazing, we received so many compliments about the meals from our guests--they loved it! The design day with Monique was a ton of fun too, the Villa is beautiful by itself but the added design elements that they offer help to personalize the venue and make it feel like yours for the day.  During the course of planning I had a number of random questions and I always sent an email their way in which they were always prompt to reply.  Ross the DJ did an awesome job and made sure to keep the guests on their feet.  Laura our day of coordinator was sure to keep everything in order and made sure that we always had a drink in our hands :).  Rehearsal day I was a bit stressed out but once I handed over all the required materials to Laura (seating chart, meal choices, table cards, song choices, etc.) I felt like all was in good hands and it was all about having fun and enjoying our wedding.  Our wedding was incredible our guests had an amazing time and it will be talked about amongst our friends and family for years to come.  Villa de Amore will always be a very special place for us as it holds one of our most favorite memories.

<gmapID>0x80db79301a119111:0xfcc118c0736d662</gmapID><Text>Love love loved Villa de Amore.  First off, it's a family business and they really treat you like you're part of their family.  Leading up to my big day, I've called, emailed, and even showed up in person with questions/concerns and each time they were very responsive and provided me great customer service.

The venue itself is just spectacular with amazing views of grapevines surrounding the entire property.  All the detail, from the barrel wall to the newly renovated cocktail hour area with amazing chandeliers, really give it the first class quality that I loved.  And my favorite part about Villa de Amore is that you get the entire property to yourself!  There is no strangers crashing your wedding, or your guests wandering into other people's events. Everyone there is either a guest of yours or working your event.

As I mentioned before, their customer service is great.  I envisioned having an ice cream bar.  They said they have never done that before and they usually do candy bars.  But instead of telling me that an ice cream bar wasn't an option, they worked things out and made it happen!  This is just one of many requests that they fulfilled.  They truly go out of their way to accommodate your requests.  The only thing I wasn't able to do that I really wanted was a sparkler send off.  But that was due to county laws - so ladies, sorry but that's a no-go.

Another great thing about Villa de Amore is that it's sort of a one-stop-shop.  They provide all inclusive packages that includes: catering, DJ, flowers, photography, cake, minister, day-of coordinator, bartenders, personal website, props (that you can use for decor as well as for your photography sessions), and customized lighting.  I chose to use my own photographer and wanted a videographer as well as a photo booth, so I had to coordinate those myself.  But all others were minimal coordination on my part (you do have to meet with those vendors to tell them what you want but you don't have to worry about paying them separately). The unique thing about this venue is that you have to purchase your own booze (they provide the bartenders but you have to stock their bar), but the little bit of hassle that it adds to your pre-wedding-to-do-list was outweighed by the huge cost savings.  I just went to Costco and purchased a little over $1,000 worth of booze and that was way more than enough for 100 guests ($400 was suggested but we wanted top-shelf and we kind of got crazy with wanting to provide a wide selection).  Had Villa de Amore required us to purchase the booze through them (like most other venues), our bill would have easily been $4,000 and up (based on the top-shelf open bar that we did).

The cost is a bit pricey but the level of service and quality that you receive for it is worth every penny.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><username>Jill Hiraizumi< /username>< user_id>

<Review>Villa de Amore was outstanding! The venue itself is absolutely stunning. Between the landscaping, decorating, and views of the surrounding vineyards, it made for a perfect setting. In fact, because the venue had so much natural beauty to begin with, we didn't need to add many decorations!

And now for the staff- our coordinator David was great. Leading up to the wedding, he was always organized, professional, informative, quick to answer our questions via email, and flexible to meet our needs. On the wedding day, he and everyone else there were great. They were helpful and checked on us frequently without being intrusive, and they were always very friendly and patient, even if our guests were a pain at times!

Another HUGE plus was the vendors VDA uses: Leah Marie photography, Bitoni catering, Elegance on Display (baker), and Soiree (florist) were all great. The photographers were particularly awesome- Marcella and Diana were friendly, efficient, and made sure that they captured all the guest combination photos that we requested. VDA also made it easy to add our own vendors. We were especially impressed with how seamlessly VDA's DJ worked with our live band.

Now, for a couple minor negatives (it was hard to think of any!!!): it would have been nice if we or our guests could have brought home some leftovers from the caterer. The food was so good but the two of us never really got the chance to sit down and enjoy it! The only other negative is that VDA's receptions have to end at 10 pm due to local noise ordinances. This is obviously out of their control, but it is something to consider when choosing a venue.

Overall, an outstanding venue from top to bottom! We really liked the combination of the simplicity of an all-inclusive wedding along with the ability to customize things to our liking. You really can't beat this place. Thank you David, Eileen, and everyone else for the best day of our lives!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80db79301a119111:0xfcc118c0736d662< /gmap_id>< pictures>

Potential, but not quite there.
The club is visually pleasing, but the atmosphere could improve drastically. With not much hype going on at the dance floor the club was very 'stay in your section and sit down' vibe. The most entertainment came from watching the gogo girls.
There is room for improvement.<//Text>

<Name>Taj Beauty Tv< /Name><date>1477978269686<//date><Rating>4< /Rating><review>Very nice inside. My only complaint is that they did not serve or have a menu to order food. They did offer a taco guy outside and surprisingly alot of people were in line.
I chose to eat elsewhere and had a few drinks- more like a lot of drinks.. it was my birthday. I called ahead and was able to reserve a booth the was centered perfectly to enjoy the live music. For Moreno Valley it definitely was nice. Like something you'd find in Hollywood. I'll go again.</review>< pictures>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>This place has potential but they just aren't getting the crowd in the door. I'll stop here & meet a few friends for a drink on our way downtown. We've done the bottle service in the nightclub a handful of times & I've simply stopped to have a few drinks on the lounge side on numerous occasions. It's a classy joint and a much needed venue in an underserved city. The main reason I don't stick around though is there's hardly anybody there. Great place for a private event. STANDARDIZED YOUR PROMOS, DROP THE RIDICULOUS COVERS & THAT DRESS CODE</review>< GmapID>

Great taproom with big selection of beer. It's also worth mentioning that they have a retailer's license and have a tall cooler with cans to go. I found several unique brews to try later.< /text>

We were there on a Trivia night so it alternated loud and quiet.  The beer was excellent,  although no food is served we brought our own pizza, which was fine.  The serve either pints or small glasses.  The smalls let you try more of their excellent variety. I highly recommend the Barebottle varieties on tap, the Coconut Donut stout was AMAZING.< /Review><Rating>5< /Rating><Date>1578798832021</Date>< GmapID>

What is not to like about a craft beer / wine bar that offers an owner who loves karaoke? The beer selection was great. All wine was local... since um Sonoma is what thirty minutes away?< /Text>

Nice bar in my hometown.  Love the karaoke nights and the overall ambiance.  Wish they had a small kitchen, but they do allow outside food which is great because we can stroll down mainstream grab a bit and enjoy in the bar.< /review>

The best kept secret this side of the inner-bay area, though I'm not from here. Wouldn't be bad if Nebraska had one of these type of establishments. Great variety of California's finest breweries served in a well balanced environment.</Review>

Perfectly located in down town suisun. Clean, great atmosphere.  Amazing tap selection and prices are right for beer on tap.  The owners care what they put out, and are there for the consumers.<//Text>

Lots of local craft bears on tap, about 30 I think. Several local wines to choose from. Fountain drinks available to purchase for your DD. No good but you can order from several of the restaurants in the complex.< /text>

My eye lids are raw from being scrubbed with their rough cotton pads. The lady waxing me explained that the old cotton pads were even worse. At one point the lady poked my eye so hard that it bruised and I pulled away. No reaction to the wax, it's super irritated on the lids from pressure and being scrubbed so hard. Very rough as well there is zero reason to be going after the eyes so hard if it's just the brows being waxed.<//Text>

Literally booked an appointment this Wednesday for Sunday because they were booked Until Sunday I have a email from the manager Megan telling me if anybody cancels before Sunday she will let me know yesterday I did not get a confirmation call so I called this morning to see what time my appointment was and come to find out they re-close the store due to COVID-19 once again without communicating with customers lack of customer service is my issue lack of ownership and accountability I will never come to this place again</Review>

<Review>Since I'm a very sensitive person I only thing is I wish from them is better talking experience when going through the waxing in my private area. Try to make the client feel more calm that would be greatly appreciated. Asking them if they're okay. Taking a little more time to get all the places that we pay good money for.<//Review>< Pictures>

I have been to the European wax center three times in the first two times were excellent the first time I was scared because I didn’t know what to expect but over all it wasn’t as bad as I thought they do exactly what they say they do and they’re good at it it’s not as painful but it could be for some people just like my last experience I got little bumps in my armpits I don’t know if that was because the wax was too hot or something that she did I just noticed that I can get the same person each time but I want to feel for other people that work there but I just put in my request to go back with the first lady when I went the first time she was so good The wax wasn’t too hot it was just right and I had no complaints her name is Maria and she works in the Fairfield European wax center<//Text>

Just about a year ago I got married and for the honeymoon hubster and I went to Hawaii! Didn't wanna bring a razor, so I decided to try waxing (which I've never done) but I heard it lasted longer than a shave so I was willing to try it! As I said this was just about a year ago!  Every single time I go, I get the same outstanding service! My specialist is Sabrina, my mom sees Dominique... We both recommend our specialists! Not sure how the pricing is since this is the only place I've been too and the only place I'll continue to go! By the way what drew me in was their advert for a lower pain wax formula they use... obviously I can't say how much lower pain it is but it definitely hurt less than I thought it would!<//text>

Stopped going to Vacaville because they couldn't keep waxers and was tired of having a different person do my Brazilian every time i went in.  Was referred to a waxer at this location and since i had prepaid for service figured I would give her a shot over letting my money go to waste.  Showed up to my first appointment and she went home early and someone else would have to do it.  The whole reason I stopped going was I don't want a different person doing my Brazilian everytime...< /review>

The girl at the front desk needs a new job, this is not for her.. I called at 3:10 and she gave me an appointment at 3:30 even after I told her I had to run home and might be a little late... I got there a little late and she said I had to reschedule... so I rescheduled to 4:30 and go next door for food and she says if someone doesn't show up she will call me.. so I come back at 4:30 and she said she gave my appointment to someone else... so not only could I not be seen for being late, after I told her I would be, then I wait there for an hour and she gives my appointment to someone else.. I had to walk away before I screamed..
So I went back and she doesn't work there anymore.. shocker O.o but the staff is very friendly and Ami is awesome!<//text>

<text>Great service my waxed was very sweet this was my first time so she tried to make sure i was ok before every wax strip/pull yes it was painful because this was my first time but 1-10 it was Like a 7 not to bad plus they are extremely clean there i would recommend ps if this is your first wax you get 50% off of the original
Price so i only payed 27$ instead of 50 big deal< /text>< pics>

Front Staff was friendly however the wax tech wasn’t as much. She seemed irritated & frustrated to say the least...she wasn’t accommodating when I asked for a towel to cover up & an extra pillow to prop my head.
Last but not least I’ve never been charged for “clean up” of my thigh area...that’s usually apart of a Brazilian wax. Smh I will not be returning!</review>< Pics>

Spotless place to live, green lawns, friendly people, who know, everyone and are concerned for all. The only thing that was missing was to watch neighbors in their robes, bunny flipflops strugling to reach over the white picket fence to hand over the cup of sugar
. .. Well kept friendly neighbors a place that seems or looks Utopia in comparison to the city it's located in.</text>

We were desperate out-of-towners visiting the area for less than one week.   We needed help, and needed it fast!   On Monday morning we limped in for a miracle, so we could get back on the road, safely.  Jim and Virginia took great care of us and gave us the temporary fix we needed.  We would have loved for them to permanently fix the car, as the quote was reasonable, but time was not on our side.   Professionalism, knowledge and such a willingness to help us, is such a treat in these crazy times in which we live.  Can’t imagine anyone else who could have helped us better than they did.</Text>

<Text>I had my car painted with minor bodywork done here for a very reasonable price. The work that was performed is outstanding. The owner Virgina is very nice and professional. The place is clean with plenty of parking spaces. The job was completed in two days! I highly recommend this place. My parents are getting their car painted here too.< /Text>< Pictures>

They make things possible where other shop can not. They eased my worries and even gave me a reasonable estimate. And as always the job was done superbly  as if nothing happened. The car was washed like new again. They did an amazing job!  I can honestly say that craftsmanship is NOT dead - I was extremely pleased with the job they did. Thank you, good job!<//review>

I just wanted to write this because my service is great. I like to go to the trails with my Jeep with my friends. However, I hit the side of my car. I looked for serval repair shops. However, a friend recommended this place for me. They gave me a way lower price then other shops were offering. As my repair was finished, I had some doubts because the price was low. I wondered if they cut any sides. Nope. Perfect. It seems as they put quality first. Thank you Brea Auto Body. You Rock.<//text>

<text>I recently crashed my car and like a normal person I went to my insurance. They gave me certain body shops to go to, so I did. I had 2 estimates before I heard of Brea Auto Body. Upon arriving, I was greeted with respect. Once seeing their estimate, I was a little hesitant. The other estimates from the other body shops were lower in price. However, they went through the estimate with me, explaining every step, and that's when I understood. Brea Auto Body uses genuine parts, straight from the dealer. The other body shops didn't even mention what parts were needed. And if I couldn't afford the  estimate, they would work with my budget. However, I was scared my insurance wouldn't work with them. And that's when I found out my insurance had lied to me. Brea Auto Body told me I had the right to repair my car where I decide. My insurance had told me to only go through these places. So I chose Brea Auto Body. And when I saw my car after it was repaired, I didn't regret it, knowing my car was fixed in the best possible way. Thank you for being honest the whole way through.<//text>< resp>

<review>I took my car in after getting rear ended. Jim was thorough in his initial estimate, unlike the collision repair shop that was contracted with the other party's insurance company that barely even glanced at my car. You could tell they take the time to do the repairs well as the whole car looked light years better than it did before I ever had the accident. They try to use OEM parts as much as possible to truly restore the car to its former state. I would highly recommend them and would definitely use their services again in the future (although I really hope I don't need to).<//review><userid>110448291464132656681<//userid><resp>None< /resp></record>

For a woman that is 50 years old, I have a hard time finding a body shop. As I own a Honda, I went to their website and searched for their Honda Certified Body Shops.That’s where I found Brea Auto Body. They are the best. The end result is spectacular. My car came out looking brand new.</Text>

Most underappreciated body shop around. Most shops today are owned by big franchises that have a high over head and use inferior aftermarket replacement parts etc. They also are super friendly and honest , did I mention awesome quality! I know this because I work with a lot of body shops all over Orange County (vehicle graphics installer). Bring your car here , and you will thank me later!<//Text>

Very professional and and very good quality. Right from the start they informed me that they use parts directly FROM THE DEALER for the best quality possible (if possible btw). They work their way around your budget as well. Overall, it is very recommended.<//Review>

I have been using this body shop ever since I got my first car and needed it repaired. I will CONTINUE to use it. It is great, and the workers are nice. They let me know every step.</Review>

While doing this extended repair work, the communication from the shop was not enough.
---------------------------------
I visited again to fix a couple of minor things. They worked promptly as a warranty service and very responsive to make calls.<//text><rate>3<//rate>< name>

Very fair and straight forward. Brea Auto Body has definitely put me in a good mood. Was told by another shop that my paint could not be matched on my truck door AFTER they already  painted it. A friend told me to go to Brea Auto Body and they worked a miracle! You cant even tell my truck was ever damaged. I am beyond grateful</Review>

<text>Our family has been a customer of Brea Auto Body for over 20 years and have experienced nothing but the BEST IN THE WEST.  The recent negative reviews by some domestic terrorists also NON CUSTOMERS should have us all concerned for the safety of business owners throughout the county and state!!  These bullies are harassing multiple  businesses for no apparent reason just to bully and terrorize. Retaliation is apparent by these reviews.  The city of  Brea is also being harassed by these domestic terrorists.  Please ignore these anti woman owned business and also a minority owned business.  These false reviews lead me to believe that these bullies are competitors in the body shop industry???  Wearing masks is a good cover for their true identity!!!</text><rating>5< /rating>< Response>

Virginia just because you continue to scream at people God bless you does not give you the right to act like a maniac. And God does not protect you from the coronavirus put your mask on. have some respect you're not special because you think you have a relationship with God I don't even care that you got upset it's the fact that you're not wearing your mask and you keep screaming about God as if that gives you some sort of right to violate people this has nothing to do with God I hope you go out of business today<//Review>

Just picked up my car after a great job of Virginia and her team replacing my front bumper on my 2017 Honda Accord.  It's like new!  The customer service throughout from the beginning to the final return of my car was exceptional. I was given every opportunity for feedback and they even sent me home with some helpful reminders for me in the event of another accident.  I totally recommend them to anyone who is looking for the very best in a Brea auto body repair service.  It's easy to see how they've been so successful and number 1 for so many years....

< review>
I have never trusted anyone in the auto repair industry...that's UNTIL I brought my car to Brea Auto Body!!

I have taken my car their for repairs twice and I will continue to take my car there as long as they are in business! If I ever move to another state and my car needs repairs, I will drive or have my car shipped here for the repairs.

Lets start with Mark Longo. I have never trusted anyone with my car like I have trusted Mark. His knowledge and professionalism is world-class. He kept me abreast of the repairs throughout the whole process from start to finish.

If you are used to taking your car somewhere and being pressured into service, I can assure you it is not like that here. You'll never feel pressured, you'll never feel stressed, and you'll never feel as though you are being taken advantage of.

That leads me to the office staff...hands down some of the nicest most capable people I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. John gave me a ride home when I dropped the car off and was an absolute pleasure to talk with. Wendy was bright, cheerful, and professional each time she called with an update, and the owner was more than generous when I picked up my car.

Do yourself a favor and avoid the headache of taking your car anywhere else...

Brea Auto Body is the ONLY place to take your car if it needs repair work done. Period.

Thanks for the great service guys and gals! While I hope I don't need to return back with car damage anytime soon, I am happy to know that if my car is damaged, I somewhere I trust to take it for the repairs!<//review>

I was a customer for a few jobs and they were doing fine.

Last time I went they gave me a form to fill out, although they had me in their computer already.  When I said no and started leaving, they didn't even try to stop me.

They lost a repeat customer over a form.  How smart is that?<//text>

Professional, quick, and very courteous. I went to have a lining in my car looked at as it was falling off. The repair guy put in a few clips and took care of problem immediately.  I also got an estimate of a dent. They explained the work that was required in detail and why it cost what it would. I decided as old as my car was, it wasn't worth it. But I would definitely recommend this place.</text>

Ive been coming here since I was 13. I absolutely love the owner and all the ladies that work here! They are polite patient and they care about how you feel as a person. Highly recommend this place if you want your hair done to your liking as well as smile and laugh together with your hair stylist. ❤️<//text>

<Time>1614037998871</Time><Review>This was such an enjoyable and worth while experience! Faye, who did my hair,  was so helpful in trying to keep my hair as healthy as it can be while giving me what I want. Not only was she quick, the cut and color were done professionally. And even before continuing with the cut and color, they provide useful information about your hair in order to keep it healthy with no further damage. Overall great experience.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>First time here. Very relaxed atmosphere. Very friendly service. My hair was trimmed and cleaned up and given texture in the back. Then the back 1/3 of the top of my hair was dyed black so that when I combed the hair back with my fingers it gave off this awesome layered effect that was part cyberpunk part matrix part 80's part X-Men all awesome. Fyi the front 2/3 of my hair is natural grey. It wasn't dyed. I'm an old man that got sexied up baby. I would highly recommend this place for 80's punk and new wave styles. They do not judge here and in fact encourage you to go for being unique. And if you're hungry, there's pizza next door. Booyah!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8g9Y9riIu6iCBoEVOwHuoAH3dTMD-eajsDpIQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNTtXFLC65aPGfPbwJ1uhZ20rYmI3zyxW6ngok=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3DXFvokAX6fYsQLWI58wC9w0X_STUtM4pIqm8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipME0Zt49YiYP7KAAvAZtTZZr0EDb9uMjaJaZ4nQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyo6Hp-ixpLIJ2vUmHUJ4COiGmzEbhrUH1BT2V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Best place around the valley, reasonably-priced and the owner will even hold the door open a bit late sometimes if you ask real nicely. They do a great job and are always smiling and chatting up the whole family as they go about the cutting of the hair.  She does well with Asian hair and Afro Asian, both male and female alike. This is no small feat considering how differently they behave.  Stop by for a quick trim or a complete makeover. You won't be disappointed.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c29bbe7ffa5b23:0x16a8cd104350fe63< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Although I also have my hair cut here by Layla, my wife actually wrote this review.
We have been Faye's clients for more than three years. BEST CUTS is simply  a delightful hair salon.  We are always greeted with smiles and warmth and then have our hair cut beautifully.  My husband and I go monthly and always enjoy the time with Faye and Layla. Many times I have brought pictures of a hairdo that I have found attractive. Faye has matched the look to perfection.  I always feel so comfortable when I am in her hands.  Our monthly visits are just like visiting a good friend.
You should try BEST CUTS. I am certain you would be pleased!

Best Cuts is AMAZING!  I've been a frequent customer for the past several years  and trust me when I tell you that you will not have a better customer experience than here!  Every staff member is kind, friendly, and most importantly talented in what they do.  Whether it's haircuts, eyebrows, or just about any other type of similar service, the quality is top notch!  The owner Faye runs this salon  with impeccable  customer treatment always at the  forefront.  Her personality clearly rubs off on the entire salon and it's so refreshing to see that, when some owners sit behind the scenes and can't be bothered.  Faye is the polar opposite and in fact, her station is  the very first in the front.   She greets everyone that walks in with an enthusiastic hello and smile!  I'm so happy to be a long time customer and go to a place where I walk in and everyone knows who I am and knows,exactly what to do!  You will not be disappointed and you'll likely walk away from the experience thrilled and looking forward to your next trip back!  Thanks to Faye and her entire team at BEST CUTS!!!!</text>

They do magic - no....way more than that.  What they do is truly unique and an absolute work of art. They put highlights on my hair that looks as if I was born with it.  How is this possible?

The products they use to wash and deep condition your hair, leaves your hair so shiny and soft.  I love the way they blow dry the hair - such a wonderful team work!

I got so many complements at work and from my friends.  I will recommend Best Cuts to everyone that wants to be a head and a shoulder above the fashion trends.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<text>Recently stumbled across this salon with my wife.  My wife needed a color and cut and I needed a haircut.  I have to say, it is the best salon we have been to.  Faye did an amazing job on my wifes color/highlights with amazing layers.  My wife looked ten years younger.  I usually go to a barber shop, but, boy, am I glad to have given this salon a shot.  Faye did an amazing job on my hair and believe me, my hair is very difficult to cut.  Their team is very skilled, professional and courteous.  Let me repeat, very PROFESSIONAL.  We will be going back again and again. Thank you Best Cuts.</text><rating>5< /rating>< user>

<review>I was desperately in need of a haircut, so on my way home, from breakfast, I stopped by  Best haircut for its proximity, in relation to  my location at the time of search. Also, due to ratings. Typically, expectation are reserved to the end, however, that was not the case here. Laila was amazing!!! from the get go. From the moment I told her what I wanted , she knew right away and started to cut away. Every strain of hair cut, felt like  freedom from the bush that had come to life and taken over my head. Laila, kept cutting with such precission that I could not hold back to express my satisfaction with the work she had so far done. You can imagine  my satisfaction when she was done. I felt relaxed, and her voice was like listening to my mother talk to me with so much care when she spoke. Prices are in line with salons, however, underprice at $15 for the service.    I expect to return to this location. 5 stars well deserved, for quickness, cleanliness, friendliness and 2 for Laila for being amazing!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Love my new look, my hair was damaged by coloring my own hair but she saved it by putting her hands on it she gave it life again. It was pricy but I nevered had thebest service from 4 lady's touching my hair on my visit they made me feel welcome and OMG they are amazing. I was afraid from some one touching my hair but I'm glad I walked in there she made my life easier by having a good hair on my head. Idk what to say but I'm in love with her work. Yall love your hair so much if you don't put a price of beauty then come here she'll make you feel welcome. Should be called goddess  salon she does miracles.< /text>

<Review>I've been going here my entire adult life, between 3-20 times a year. The atmosphere is very casual and family friendly. The prices and service have always made it feel great to leave a good tip. Even when we haven't come in for a long time, retiring, we are treated like family. Please support them in these trying times!</Review>< pictures>

<Text>We have been coming here for years. The owner is super friendly always comes to hang out n chat and gives us his special home made hot sauces. Proceed with caution if you try one they are hot! Good food for the price. One of the few places around here you can get away with a 10$ meal< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>All-you-can-eat! Hard to beat right?

While the assembly line might lack in overall freshness - it makes up for it with options.

Also, the dinner deal makes this my favorite Mongolian BBQ spot in all of Thousand Oaks.

Great service, and usually some sports on TV if you’re having lunch.

Lots of food for a fair price - and the owner has no problem setting you up with a take-home plate.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>Best noodles you’ll have!!  You can build your bowl with whatever you want, as large at you want. (You have to be good as adding the noodles at the end to make it bigger). The service is amazing, because the owner is one of the greatest guys!  (For me, it’s more worth it to come for lunch because it’s less expensive than all you can eat dinner, and you can get a to go box). Not to mention the whisking and taste is nothing short of phenomenal!  Truly one of Thousand Oaks wonders!<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrcVzfGMS8O1Oon_IhtcynaolQkwT9x0utS6sO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5T8-1oe35buNENBTrzDHrACofpSVPyY0zvIX4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Good food, lunch is ~$10 as much as you can fit into a bowl (just make sure you compress the items as much as possible). Dinner is ~14, but it's all you can eat. Allow yourself for plenty of time and bring an appetite.<//review>< Pics>

This Mongolian BBQ has been around since the 70s. I used to own the camera shop that was next door to the restaurant. Would go in there at least two or three times a week for lunch or dinner. I love the food though I do wish the selection of vegetables was more. We moved our location of the camera shop and Mongolian BBQ eventually expanded out knock down the wall and double their size. Whenever we go to Thousand Oaks we eat there. Still love the food<//Text>

<review>So glad that we have a Mongolian BBQ in T.O. It is delicious and a fun way to cook food. They have added a few items lately to throw on the grill, but there is always room to add more. It's all you can eat, but I usually don't finish my 2nd dish!<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80e825232540bce7:0x1071678fd4a74bd0< /Gmap_id></record>

Took 20 minutes to get the check with only 8 customers and a full staff. There were no lines, and yet staff was continually distracted. Decent food, terrible service, staff takes forever,</review>

Staff is extra friendly and attentive and was so impressed at how kind and equally attentive they were to kids eating there. Lot of healthy and delicious flavorful options to pick and choose for all tastes so appeals to all. Brought a large group in and it was perfect as everyone made their own dish to order so appealed to everyone.< /review>< Pictures>

The restaurant is much bigger now (they expanded into the space next door), and the food is just as wonderful as it always has been. They have a great selection of items to fill your bowl with, and each entree includes their wonderful soup, potstickers and flat bread. When I'm in Thousand Oaks, I always try to stop by. The staff is always friendly and the food fabulous. What more could you want?< /Text>< pics>

<review>Decent food and small parking lot make this an average spot. They have a good lunch special - make sure you load up on smaller pieces of meat, otherwise you will get less food.

<review>Good enough service, but sign says mask recommended NOT required, after ordered food they made us wait outside because I didn't have a mask on and then yelled at me saying mask required inside building, but only after we paid of course. What's the point of vaccination if people.are still gonna get kicked out for not wearing a mask when mask are not required anymore< /review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Normally this is the go to spot foy my family and self however the current state is a no go. This also opens me to how this would ever be acceptable to begin with and I'll be visiting other locations for my fast food fixes in the future.

Open construction and particle dust on all the windows. Exposed wiring right above the ice cream machine and food bagging area.

No thanks to these standards! Enjoy at your own risk!<//Review>

We can't wait to go back and look all the way through this wonderful store, the prices are amazing,  almost everything we bought was 30%  or more off. Loved it 😍🤩<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

< review>
Never have I had such bad service. They burned my food. It was through the drive thru and I was too far away to go back. I asked for it well done, not blackened. Will never go to this location again. Complained to corporate but that didn't seem to matter.</review>

Your typical fast food meal nothing fancy but good quick comfort food on the go.< /Review><Time>1620265449851< /Time>< userid>

<Text>Worst McDonald's ever!!! They messed up our order and when I told them at the window when they gave us the food they said we'd have to go though the drivethrew again. If it weren't for the fact that it was for one of my children I wouldn't have gone through the line again. I was very specific that we wanted 2 plain burgers with only ketchup and they still put pickles and mustard on it. My son is autistic and only likes ketchup. Very disappointed. The staff was rude about it too.😡<//Text><gmapID>0x8090510af101a685:0x93cd387c89df18ba<//gmapID>< user_id>

Very rude. They got my food wrong 3 times. I ended up leaving my food and not even getting a refund.  I understand there was a new person working but I explained my order to other workers as well. I was very patient because I understand when a person is new. But for other workers not being able to correct my order is unacceptable.< /review>

Normally this is the go to spot foy my family and self however the current state is a no go. This also opens me to how this would ever be acceptable to begin with and I'll be visiting other locations for my fast food fixes in the future.

Open construction and particle dust on all the windows. Exposed wiring right above the ice cream machine and food bagging area.

No thanks to these standards! Enjoy at your own risk!</Review>

Very slow as usually. Only to wait another 10 minutes because when the girl went to put the food through the window the bag ripped and half of my order fell onto the ground. So we waited another 5 minutes for the manager to have an attitude because she had to go back into the store to get our drink.< /Review>

Fudge sundae was not filled to the top. In fact, only halfway. This is unacceptable behavior and this will have to be discussed with the manager. My name is Karen and I disapprove of not filling up fudge sundaes and McFlurrys to the top!</Text>

Worst service ever. We ordered on ubereats &’ received the wrong order. They told us to go to the store &’ get correct items. We went &’ they gave us the wrong order again. Told us they’ll bring out the right one, we went home and realized it was wrong AGAIN. So we went back to the store &’ told them it was the wrong order they proceeded to tell us it wasn’t although I didn’t have the right drinks or sandwiches. They said we were “holding up their line” &’ yelling at us. Other Mcdonald’s in Modesto are more helpful than this one on Prescott Rd. This store sucks and so does their food &’ employees. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.</review>

I was treated like a convict for ordering a coffee.I went to the 1800Prescott Mod #2707 location.When receiving my drinks I noticed that I did not receive my large hot coffee that I ordered at the drive up,I preceded to look at my receipt & noticed that it wasnt put on.I told the guy at the window, who happened to be the manager Victor & he told me that Since i already am receiving food that i will have to reorder & drive to the back of the line which had 3 cars behind me.I told him that the woman did not put it on the tab & that it was just 1 hot coffee. He rudely looked at me & told me that I need to go to the back or he would call the police on me & he is not going to ring my card at the register.Shocked I say that its just 1 coffee which was already ordered but not added & that i wasnt moving my car until i received my coffee.He then called his worker over who then began to call the police.I drove away angry & frustrated that i could not get a coffee for my husband who is working night during this covid crisis&who now was about to be late for work due to spending almost 20 mins at mcdonalds .I will never eat at mcdonalds again & i would like a full refund & a apology from the rudest incompetent & laziest manager on earth victor<//review>

This specific location has become notorious for running you through their drive thru and parking you. Customers are fed up with what this location is doing!! Something is always cold. The employees are friendly and only doing what management is asking them to do. I'm not sure why they time the drive thru wait because it's not accurate.  Were not getting our food were parked and waiting !! Terrible Customer Care By Management!< /Review>

Prices seem to go up a bit each time I go there. Got two chicken sandwiches off the dollar menu and paid two dollars. Next time I ordered the same thing and was charged four dollars as the price had changed to "Buy 2 for 4". Not happy about that as I'm on a tight budget. Haven't been back since. Service is quick and friendly.< /Review>

So today I went in and ordered food and this unfortunate man had only 2 dollars and was trying to order a drink because she refused a water cup and made him pay for it. she is white and 5 3 she was being rude. and I am more fortunate and was able to buy him food and I felt like she was did discrimating against him. If you see someone in need please order them food or give them anything they are more than likely not gonna get drugs if they are in a restaurant show respect for them.</review>

Kinda an in between feeling about this location, very recently my husband went and got food for us and I was in shock when he handed me my bag, for starters the burger was cold, dry and hard and the box of fries was barely half full, shortly after my kids were upset cause their happy meals didn't have their gogurts it's one thing if it was one of the Happy Meals before it could be too was really shocking to me smh I call them about the issue and it's like no one had time to answer the phone. They definitely need work.</Review>

<Text>So my wife is anaphylactic to tomatoes. We went amd said this too when we asked f9r no ketchup on her #3 order. We get pur food and she takes two bites and ends up tasting ketchup on the tip of her tongue. The paper taped to the burger box clearly said no ketchup on it yet they put it on it anyways. I went to go have it fixed and the people acted like it was the biggest pain. Ive worked in fast food before so i know about the rush but my wife and unborn son couldve been killed for negligence like that. And when i went to check the new one just in case they acted like i was maling a big deal. Problem is it kind of is because someones life could be on the line. Luckily my wife is fine and only has a blister on the tip of her tongue from this encounter. But this is the third mcdonalds to do this. They need to train people for situations like this or their could be a wrongful death lawsuit on their hands next time<//Text>< pictures>

Just went to this location and had a Daily Deal coupon. I told the window lady and she called for the manager and i showed him my receipt and i told him my coupon was for a quarter pounder and medium fry for $5 and that i was still being charged for a quarter pounder. He said i wasn't but i kept tryin to tell him. So they gave me the $5 daily deal but not for what the coupon was for, they put it towards 2medium fries. The point of the coupon was to have a burger and fry for $5. Also my fries were stale, tasted old and cold. You guys really should listen to your customers and pay more attention to what you're doin< /review>

I waited a while before being greeted. There's 2 speakers at this location and the cars were moving faster at the other one. The guy giving me my drinks was rude. I asked for a drink carrier and he rudely said just for 2 drinks? Yes I have a child with me and it's easier to carry. My big mac was made sloppy and fell apart. In general there's too much bread not enough meat for the big mac. Not ordering that again.<//review>

Although the food is great, the attitude of some the employees is rotten. The only ones that greeted you with a smile are no longer there or I haven't seen her lately. This one doesn't bring the food to your table when you dine-in. Also, they took away the use of the TV any time during the day and I'm certain its due the "homeless" problem.<//Review>

I hate those machines to place your order takes twice as long as just going to the counter. When I was there this older couldn't figure it out.

Your sausage McMuffin was only a $1.00 now it's $1.50 what happened to the $1.00 MENU<//review>

I love their kids play structure. There is plentiful seating in the kids area however they keep it really cold and do not monitor their rules. Oftentimes there are parents who opt to sit in the main area and watch their kids through the glass because of the extreme climate difference. This means they do not adequately monitor their children which is a rule of the play structure. Some also allow they children to play and eat. I feel there should be someone enlisted to monitor the play area during their shift. Not just to clean it but also to make sure people are following the rules.< /Text>

I'm given this McDonald's a 5 star rating because I was homeless for a few weeks and I was sleeping in my car and looking for a job. I come by almost every day. And not ones did anyone tell you I had a leave or anything. People ten to look down on homeless people. Now I have a job, my wife back. I just wish I could do more for them<//text>

<Review>Be sure to check your order if it's a drive through or take out before you leave. Although, the employees are nice, and polite, they almost always get your orders wrong. They usually leave something out. Also, remember to double-check for napkins you may need to ask for the more than one or two your usually bagged.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Great location for a quick bite while you're shopping. Very close to Grocery Outlet in the Briggsmore Plaza. Also, a great place for getting a cup of coffee on a cold day or if you are feeling worn out from exercising at In-Shape. Quick and friendly service.</review>

It was 5 five star .... now the new remodel I have to drop it down to a 2 star... with out even tasting the food .... it feel like there trying to make me work at McDonald's... ordering my own food ... I dont think I will be coming here anymore ... and it there all going to be like this I will have to look for a new place to eat ...  the worker did the menu for me and it took 3 times longer then me telling him mc double large fry large drink... he had to add each item one at a time and punch threw 4 to 5 sub menu to get to the item I wanted.... what do you think if i had to do that .... i would of walk out .... so all in all fast food just got a lot slower in life .... ooo yeah my foods here and it's good... but i guess that's beside the point .... i guess ... 😕</review>

<review>They had me waiting on one side if the drive through while they took the order of the other cars that pulled up after I did on the other side. Then they gave me a coke full of ice after I said no ice and they put onions on my burger when the order clearly said no onions. And my fries were cold. Should have just gone to Jack in the Box.</review>< GmapID>

I asked for some sauce, and she really asked me “for what”  I said for my fries and with an attitude she told me that she was going to charge me ... well I’m sorry I didn’t know, you gave my boyfriend some sauce earlier. Not my fault you had a bad day.< /review>

I was here for 45 minutes and they could not find my order let alone look up my order.  I go back every 10 minutes to ask apparently there’s no order then why did my friend pay 32 bucks for nothing!?! Not to mention that most of the people barely knew the system at all< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Seriously. It's McDonald's.
NOT fine dining. NOT anything dining.
Quite terrible actually... BUT...
In a pinch, hey... It's McDonald's.< /Text>

We go to this location very often and I like it because the employees are very nice and patient with the customers. It's so much better than the one on Dale and pelandale road, they're so rude at that location and for some reason always mess up the simplest orders. That's why we stick to this location, so thank you for being the best you can be.<//Review>

We can’t really go to this location and most of the time they get our order wrong we’re driving back-and-forth because they got a breakfast sandwich is wrong or they didn’t give us enough hashbrowns that we ordered and I’m tired of having to go back-and-forth because they can’t get our order right.....<//Text>

<Text>They got our order wrong twice which is crazy since we only ordered 4 sausage mcmuffins, 4 hashbrowns, and 2 sodas, then they tried to charge us twice for our drinks. Won't be returning there any time soon.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>I didn't want to give a star at all but i guess i had no other choice but to give one smh manager with very nasty attitude over her messing my order up. I asked for 2 cheese burgers with extra pickles and onions but instead i got a dry burger with no ketchup or mustard or extra pickles and onions lol but my other one was just fine my fries was old and hard i am very ashamed of this franchise poor poir manager skills very dissatisfied.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< rate>
