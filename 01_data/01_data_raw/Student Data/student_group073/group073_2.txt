I am highly impressed with their wash and fold service. It cost me less money than doing it at my complex, the clothes were folded impeccably and she organized them by person for me! I also appreciate that they had a selection of detergent for me to choose from.<//Text>

<time>1572809396519< /time><Rate>4</Rate><text>This laundromat is clean and the laundry machines are fast. The washing machines seem to be in new condition. The dryers as well seem to be a new condition. The laundromat looks pretty new but it is cramped due to its location. So expect a lot of cramped room in between the aisles. The machines accept coins bills and also credit or debit cards and there's also a loyalty card available that offers bonus credits. One downside is that they do charge to use the restroom but that's sort of the norm for most laundromats. Parking is somewhat of an inconvenience because there are handicap spots available in the front but not too many general parking spaces in front of the laundromat. There are a few parking spots behind the laundromat but not many. The place does have Wi-Fi and you'll need a password. I would give this place five stars but there isn't a lot of convenient parking and the attendant is not available. Prices seem very reasonable.</text>< Pics>

Place is very small. That wouldn't be so bad if so many of the machines, which seem almost brand new, weren't out of order or constantly taking your money and not washing or drying your clothes. That wouldn't be so bad, but there's usually nobody there to refund your money. Occasionally, there is a young woman there who is very nice but isn't given the capability to refund monies lost.< /Text>

Convenient and reasonably priced but the 3 machines hardly used any water (front loading, easy to see) and they didn't clean my clothes. The first time I went, they were normal... today I wasted time and  money.</Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80d95881ff32f63b:0x40944749808396</Gmap_id><Review>I wanted to like this laundromat so much, considering how close it is to home, but after multiple issues, I just can't.
My first trip was great, got my laundry done and went home.
My second trip was at night, and my dryer was scheduled to be finished an hour before the laundromat closed. My friend and I decided to wait in my car which was parked directly in front of the laundromat because there's nothing but hard benches & stools to sit on inside. When the cycle was done we tried to go back inside but the front door was locked. The attendant came and let us in, and told us that we were lucky because she was about to go home. Never mind our (and multiple other customers') laundry was still inside and it was an hour before the business is scheduled to close?
Today really got me though. One of my washers just stopped 7 minutes before the cycle was over, leaving my two blankets completely soaking wet because it didn't do the extra spin that I paid for. When I took all my clothes out of the large washer, they all smelled like a freshly-opened can of black olives. (It's as disgusting as it sounds.) When I switched my clothes to a different machine, the next one I opened was still wet inside and smelled like mildew.
It's amazing how poorly maintained this place is, for being brand new. I want the extra $10 I spent paying for an extra spin cycle I never got, rewashing *all* of my clothes and paying for extra dry time for my soaking blankets.</Review>< Resp>

<text>The past few times that I have come here to do a little laundry in the evening, I have been appalled when I walked inside and it literally looked really dirty and there was soap, fabric softener, dryer sheets and miscellaneous clothes all over the place.
I picked up what I could but it still was a major disaster!  People are such pigs when they come into a laundromat and leave their excess and messes for other's to have to clean up after them.
* I was NOT HAPPY last night when I came in to dry my clothes and I needed to wash my hands in the bathroom and come to find out that I'm being charged 50 cents on my laundry card to use the bathroom. I guess I didn't have anything left on my card and there was nowhere to put two quarters to open the bathroom door to wash my hands.
I'm not very happy with the ways in which everything has drastically gone up in price including charging to use the bathroom!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Nice looking and clean with efficient machines that are
reasonably priced.

However, if you use your credit or debit card the machines will take extra money off of your card without your knowledge.  My wife and I came to wash a single load of laundry using a $2 machine.  Our bank account shows we were charged $2.18 AND AN ADDITIONAL $10.  I immediately called the posted phone no. and it went straight to voicemail.  The posted sign also said the nearby Cricket store would help if needed so I went there to complain.  The man there told me there was an attendant at the laundry mat but when I talked to her she told me that in fact the man at the store was the owner.  When I went back to the Cricket store and confronted him about the $10 charge he started talking about how only temporary but I told him that doesn't matter.  You can't just take $10 out of people's account without their knowledge.  He started some assinine explanation about how restaurants do the same thing (how ironic that we had just come from a restaurant where that DIDN'T HAPPEN), but I cut him off and told him (yelled it really) as I was exiting his store he needs to post signs warning people that his is taking their money "temporarily".

On another review site, a one star reviewer complained that when she bought a $20 fastcard, the machine TOOK AN ADDITIONAL $20 FROM HER ACCOUNT.

This is not an honest and respectable business practice.  People should not only boycott this store but they should actively work to put this charlatan out of business unless he stops taking people's money without their knowledge.<//Review>

<Review>The first time I went there the place was very clean. There was an attendant there cleaning. The next 2 time no attendant and the place wasn't very clean. Today it was a mess. Someone had flooded the floor with soapy water. I called 2 phone numbers and textEd a message online .  No one came to clean it uo. I had a concern that someone could fall. I guess the ownet didn't have the same concern. I will take my business some where else.< /Review><gmapID>0x80d95881ff32f63b:0x40944749808396< /gmapID>< Date>

*INFO*
Clean, nice machines, and have a machine to get quarters or pay with credit/debit cards, but it's pricey. Expect to pay $8-10 to wash and dry one large load.
Also, their exclusive card deal is terrible, so don't bother. There's also rumors of this place charging extra money from paying with credit/debit, so stick to cash/change.</review>< pictures>

If i could give 0 stars i would. I am royally pissed off. Brought my SERVICE dog in to do my laundry and got told i needed to leave. I told the lady (even though I didnt have to. She couldnt legally ask me. Considering it is medical information) she is an emotional support dog because i have bad anxiety. She said she called the owner and the owner couldnt care less. DO NOT GO HERE.</Review>

We been there several times and we are always happy and please with service.
But today our server was not having a good day! She spilled our drink not even cleaned it or say sorry.
I had to ask for napkins to clean her mess . I understand we all have our days but she was very rude!  Our food wasn't cheap her tip was included since it was a party of 7 ! She didnt deserved the tip.< /Review>

<Time>1615194946432<//Time><Text>Vineyard Cafe is so amazing and a great place to dine for small and large groups. Right now of course it's only available for takeout but the menu is just as extensive as always and everything is prepared fresh great time and wonderful portions. the last time I got to dine there in person was for my birthday and we enjoyed the Mimosa brunch as always. also the manager Hector has always provided us with amazing customer service he is such a hard worker and great at his job. I can't wait till we can finally start enjoying the restaurant inside again but for now it needs to happen at a social distance. Thank you so much for the great service we'll be returning ASAP<//Text>< user_id>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Place needs to hire better waiters/waitresses. Litterally didn't see my Waitress for 45 minutes. When I order bottomless Mimosas I expect to be constantly serviced, not have to get up and fetch someone to get me another one. The food is way over priced and not even that good. Two people with "bottomless" mimosas came out to $80. This was my third time going here, but it will be my last.</review>< pictures>

The food is AMAZING. Large portions, great flavors, a huge selection of menu items, you can pretty much get anything you want for breakfast. We loved the different syrup choices too! We can't wait to visit the area again to have this breakfast! Thank you! I highly recommended this place.<//Text>

Their "chilaquiles" are literally chips out of a bag with cheese melted on them - YUCK! No salsa, avocado, onion, etc. Had a strawberry mimosa and it was good, but definitely not the best, especially for $8.95. The service also wasn't great and we sat around and waited for the check, long after our plates had been picked up. I will say, however, the atmosphere itself was great, tables were socially distanced appropriately (not all have umbrellas though) and food came out quickly. First and last time there.<//Text>

We called in an order for pickup around 8:00am on Sunday while out on our way to a hike. The guy in the phone was super nice and the food was ready within 5 mins of our arrival. Everyone inside I could see was wearing masks and they had a pickup station set up in the front. We ordered the breakfast burrito to share; it comes with a giant burrito plus two pancakes! It was PLENTY of food for the two of us. The pancakes were particularly fluffy and delicious. Everything was hot, it came in a really sturdy container, and they provided salsa and sour cream toppings to go which I thought was awesome. While we couldn't eat in due to Covid, it looks like a really cute spot inside for brunch when things get better!< /text>

This review is only for the drinks and service not the food since I did not eat here! My friends brought me here with the sole purpose of trying the banana beer, I know it sounds weird but if you like light, refreshing beers you will absolutely love this beer! Great and super friendly service, even on a busy Friday night they took the time to answer our questions and made sure we had a good time.</review>

It was our first time here we thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband ordered the vineyard grand breakfast which came with sausage, bacon, ham, hash browns, and 2 pancakes. I ordered chicken and waffles. The food was really good they have a big menu for breakfast and brunch. Unlimited Mimosas! Our waiter was Hector he was pleasant, fast service, and just the right amount of attentiveness. I would recommend this place plus it was a bonus that they accept the axxess card.<//text>< rating>

Great food, mainly for breakfast. Fast service and very nice staff. Worth the wait. Don't be turned away by the line outside when there is one.</text>

Ok, this place is so awesome. The food is DELICIOUS! & the owner and staff are very friendly and helpful. I left with my good to go with a smile on my face and was so pleasantly surprised when I took a bite of my sandwich and a sip of my tea. Products are organic and fresh! I ordered the Turkey club with fries and a German crepe to taste since I live out of town, just plan to warm it in the AM. Drinks on tap and Mimosas available. Highly Recommended<//text>

So much food for the price and its Delicious!!! Best time to go is a little after it opens because its not packed. I noticed on Sunday's people start showing up after 8am so go early. My wife and I enjoyed the emptiness.< /Review>

<review>FINALLY!!! An amazing breakfast spot in North Oxnard!!!!
Great service and great food for a great price at an amazing location ❤️
Being a resident of the River Ridge Golf Course neighborhood means this amazing breakfast spot is just down the street from me! I love a hearty breakfast and have been patronizing this establishment regularly since it opened! It's become really busy lately even with the pandemic. Great businesses like this one will be successful simply because they practice the basic fundamentals of a winning restaurant establishment. Great quality, fresh food for a fair price.
From the freshly squeezed orange juice to the freshly sliced avocado. This Oxnard gem deserves the business it receives due to the fact that it is a genuine and true provider of great service and amazing tasting comfort food. I'm a fan! From the steak to the chorizo, the food is always high quality and tastes GREAT!< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80e84d40c525cef5:0xb83a18857f767c76<//gmap_id></record>

I ordered through doordash and when I got my meal it was very cold, I will not order through doordash again. When I complained to doordash all they wanted to do was give me $4.09 doordash credit but I tried to talk with an agent and Kevin was very rude and just shut down the chat because he did not like that I would not accept the small amount. I know the delivery has nothing to do with this Cafe, but this is the Cafe I ordered the food from and they should have made sure the food was hot before sending. My total bill through doordash was over $20.<//review>

I love the menu, love the atmosphere but a couple of the servers need to step up their game face.  It's not cheap to eat here and I expect to be greeted with a happy friendly smile not a frown and curt treatment.  I'm going to seriously think about coming back.  He should be happy they are still open and it takes people like us to keep it open.  This guy is downright rude.  He just threw the plates on the table.  Not good at all.<//Review>

Fantastic service and great recommendations.  First time here.. And it won't be my last. Food was hot and served to perfection.  I ordered the chilaquiles and a crepe for my sweet tooth.  They both exceeded my expectations.  I already sent messages to my family and friends to come back and try out new dishes. Hector, my server, was patient and always had a smile on his face. Manager came by and checked in on me as well. Looking forward to my next experience. Keep up the great work!< /text>

Came up to visit my daughter from 🍊 County. Asked to be taken to a great restaurant for breakfast. Boy was she right! This place had great menu to choose from. Fantastic service and food. Mari was also a very good server. We had pancakes, hashbrowns, red potatoes, refried beans, chorizo, spinach omelet, cornbeef hash, breakfast burrito chilaquiles,  fresh squeezed orange 🍊 juice and coffee. Every item was fantastic!!! You must try if you never have. Definitely stopping here again when we visit my daughter.<//Review>

They called our number but two others stepped in and cut in front of us, and we had to ask the host to check their number because we were next. The host told them it was our turn and seated us but didn’t apologize after waiting for a long wait to be seated. They took about 10 min after seating us to get our orders. After getting our food, we got sausages in both of our plates when we had asked for bacon. Also they sat us next to three ladies that were very obnoxiously loud throughout the entire time we were eating. These ladies were too chatty with the waiter that was assisting us and we were hoping the waiter would asked them to keep it down because we had a hard time talking and hearing with each other since they were too loud. The food was good but we hoped for a much better dining experience. We might not come back which is a shame because we travel a lot to Ventura.<//Text>

This place is amazingly good. There are many options and you really can’t go wrong. Everything I have had here is delish. The chilaquiles are one of my favorite. Nutella crepes OMG can’t get enough of those. I recently for the first time had the chicken crepes it was different in flavor and so good (spinach, mushroom, onion Swiss cheese and the hollandaise sauce on top. Did I mention the poblano soup of the day so creamy? Best all day breakfast and alcoholic beverages. Mimosas (strawberry, watermelon, pineapple) You won’t be disappointed.< /Text>

Food was good but was brought out cold. Coffee pots are small for two coffee lovers and it was so busy (good sign) that we could ask for a refill on it.
I will go back but I wouldn't rate it as my top picks for breakfast< /review>

The service is awful, the food is not good at all, low quality, a lot of noise pollution, the waitress was not cordial. They took very long to make rounds to the table. Not friendly at all. Will not be going back.<//review>

<Review>Was craving a sweet dinner, kinda like breakfast for dinner thing & we made the right choice to try this place out! I had the German pancakes & my husband had the strawberry crepes. Food is made to order and service is quick! We will be back 🤗. My kids loved their meal too, the chicken Alfredo pasta for my 10 year old + club sandwich for my teen. We give it a thumbs up 👍🏽< /Review></record>

<review>Outstanding food. A gem of a restaurant. Have eaten there 5 times with my family, breakfast and lunch. Good menu selection. Exceeded my expectations. I hope the restaurant survives, as it's kind of hidden, with limited signage.
Always quick service, served hot. You won't be disappointed.</review><Name>Shawn Johnson< /Name>< GmapID>

My new favorite brunch place. Super clean and modern interior. Fantastic omelettes, and very friendly staff. When you go, definitely try their steak omelette, and the lingonberry crepes are AMAZING.

This is the kind of local gem that will have you coming back all the time to try everything on the menu.</review>

My husband and I went to Vineyard Cafe this morning for the first time. As soon as we entered I was especially impressed with the great feeling I felt about the place. It is very attractive. The wait staff was on top of things and very friendly. I had cheese blintz with strawberry glaze and my husband had eggs, bacon, toast and cottage cheese. The food came quickly and it was all delicious. We are already talking about when we will go again.< /Review>

The German Pancakes are fantastic. A bit heavier than a crepe and lighter than your average pancake. With fresh squeezed lemon juice and lemon butter was all that is needed to make this a tasty treat. I recommend this place.< /Review>

New place to enjoy a meal. Food is good and service is very friendly. Was a joy to meet the owner. Be sure to go around the point of the building to the entrance, the flower/gift shop might fool you into thinking they are closed.</Text>

Came in for breakfast this morning and was impressed! The interior is beautiful and most importantly the food was excellent! The portions are bigger than expected. I had the vegetable omlette with the hollandaise sauce which was perfectly light smooth and creamy. The crispy red potatoes on the side were a surprise star with a delicious slightly spicy seasoning that I loved. One of the few breakfast places I've been to where the potatoes are done up and need no ketchup or hot sauce to be exciting. The service was great and friendly. Will be back with friends!<//text>

Had breakfast during a visit with family....service was excellent and food was good! Had pancakes and an omelet with the fresh squeezed OJ! However the OJ was pricey at $7 bucks per glass NO REFILLS!< /Review>

The Chorizo Hash Browns Pancakes were delicious! Beans were too dry. Freshly squeezed orange juice sweet and good. Coffee was good!</Review>

Owners Sammy & Omar are great!! They offer Great deals. The furniture selection is Absolutely Amazing! I purchased a 3 PC sofa set & unfortunately the pieces didn't come in together. They gave me the option to get something else. I opted for a sectional with a rocker recliner chair. I Absolutely LOVE IT!!
My delivery guys Eric & Wyatt arrived on time. They were very professional & setup everything perfectly! They didn't even mind my request of removing their shoes.
I highly recommend Elegant Furniture They have everything!!< /Text>

My new House looks amazing :) thanks to Elegant Furniture they have Modern furniture and great selection. I just moved to fresno I live about 25 miles away I gone to Elegant Furniture the recommendation of my niece who shopped there.  I purchased 3 mattresses, sofa, Dinning Table, and accent chairs I was satisfied with the price and quality of the items I purchased.  What I liked about the Elegant that impressed me was the customer service from the sales persons and the delivery crew.  Very polite and helpful and even get “Yes Sir” where do you find that now! That left me with a very good impression of Elegant Furniture.  The following month I purchased a coffee table and 4 additional accent chairs.  My mother also moved next to me and she was so impressed with Elegant Furniture she purchased a sofa both my mom and I will continue to purchase from Elegant Furniture.  excellent place to buy your furniture.< /text>

This is by far the best furniture store in Fresno...and I've shopped a number of them. I remodeled my home and needed some amazing furniture worthy of all the work and money spent. I purchased a bed, sectional, sleeper sofa, Dinning Table, stunning bar cart and coffee table. Yes, my home looks like a Elegant and I couldn't be more happy! And the price is right!! I also have to rave about the incredible customer service from both Sammy & Omar. They both were incredibly helpful and very knowledgeable about all their products. They assisted with design layout ideas and had tremendous follow up. And most importantly, they were very patient and understanding that these decisions aren't simple. Great store, great people.<//review>

elegant did an excellent job getting my furniture delivered to me. They were punctual, friendly and set everything up quick and then cleaned up every little piece that was left over! They made sure they looked over the Dining table to assure it was in good condition. Thank you again for your great service guys!</Review>

<Text>Ordered a sectional from the floor model, was told it would be in in 2 months, Guess what ?? I still don't have my furniture. not to mention that I gave them $500.00 cash, on the guarantee that I will have my furniture. I understand that the borders of CHINA seems to be the delay for everything is what I am always being told YET, THEY have My $$$, but, How is it that other companies are getting their merchandise and these guys are NOT. I was recommended to only buy here, and now I regret it. Almost 3 months later NOTHING, NO FURNITURE. I am sure they are good People But, This is NOT Professional at ALL. I will KEEP THEM IN PRAYER.. To not be able to get My furniture to me, IS poor.  It must be getting specially Made and shipped from Across the world. Buy American Products built here in the U.S. Blame COVID 19.. Once I get My Sectional Then I will Update My review of these Guys, Until then My review will stay at a 1 star. God Bless to those who read my HONEST review, Especially the BBB.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The best place to buy furniture! I am more than happy to find that store. We could find everything that we need for our news house at the best price in one place. The sales staff is very professional. And the order was delivered in the exact scheduled time. Thank you guys! You are the best!<//Review>

<Text>Probably the best experience i ever had purchasing furniture. The quality of their furniture is as great as the wonderful customer service and the delivery crew. They are very much on top of their game with communicating clearly and effectively to make sure the customer is 100% satisfied. Once the order is received their team goes out of their way to make sure the customer's experience is beyond satisfactory. I highly recommend this store and I am very pleased with the product I purchased and the price I paid for it. I will continue to use them for future purchases<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>I came to the store today looking for dining room chairs. The sales representative welcomed me immediately when walking in the door. I told him the problem I had with finding the right chairs for the table I'd already purchased. It took him only a few seconds after looking at my table before pointing out chairs in the showroom that were a perfect match. Gray chairs to go along with my marble table...I hadn't even noticed the gray accents running through the marble. It was perfect! Thank you OMAR for being the sales representative ever! You have clear designing instincts and your selling approach was not at all pushy. Thank you for a very professional shopping experience at Elegant Furniture.</Text><Date>1574111182358< /Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user_id>

This is my second time purchasing furniture at this store and I only came back because of the excellent service I was given by Sammy. Sammy is very nice and highly great customer service. I’ve never met anyone that makes you feel so comfortable while buying furniture. Thank you Sammy you are the best and I’ll be back for sure 😉</Review>

At first I was so in love with my new bed it  was so pretty there was sewing that looked like it wasn’t done correctly like it was opening but I just thought that how it was because it was holding it together but literally a month and a half later the sewing is opening up like there’s a huge hole on the bench of my bed.
(Update the person in charge did get back to me he was very nice and professional about the situation and tried to work with me.  He did get me replacement which he paid for)<//Review>

<Text>My wife went in and talked to Sam. He was very respectful and very friendly. We both went back 3 days later to purchase a bedroom set. Got it all for less than $1,000. The same set we saw at a furniture store across the street for $1600. Great prices. Great customer service. And just all around good honest people. Very accepting of every one. Even if your only spending $25 they treat you like your the best customer in the world!!! Highly recommend!<//Text>< gmapID>

Just purchased a sectional from Elegant Furniture. When i picked up and assembled it, it turned out to be the wrong model however Omar was quick to fix it and deliver their right one for free. Very friendly staff and happy with my sectional. Their 90 day buy allowed me to easily finance and take it home at a decent price. Definitely will be back to upgrade my dining table and bedroom set👍🏻</review>

<Text>5 stars is not enough! Sammy was so helpful. We went in looking to buy just a bed frame but couldn't pass up the amazing offers. First, since the moment we walked in we felt so welcomed! Sammy gave us our time to look around and was very helpful with all the questions we had. You can tell he really cares about his customers by the way he generously wants to help you find what you're looking for. We'll definitely be back for more furniture in the future!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>This is my second time ordering from Elegant. I love the style of their furniture. The quality and durability of their furniture are why I decided on purchasing from them. And their style is just different and attractive. Delivery was fairly fast and paid about $50 for assembly. I highly recommend this company.</review>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>I am a homebody person I literally read every review before I even go to a store. I see a lot of positive reviews but they don't appear to be very honest. I've read a few to where the manager is exposing the customer information all because they wrote a bad review a lot of lying going on calling customer in saying their products are in store but in reality the store salesperson just wanted to bash the customer to remove a review because "IT MAKES YOUR STORE LOOK BAD" it's called "FREEDOM OF SPEECH" if you have to lie to get someone to buy an item or don't speak on how I feel about that product they just purchased then your not loyal to your customer especially the new ones that were considering on coming in. Thank you to those that where truthful and honest I really appreciate it. And just by literally reading everyone's review I've made my decision not to bother with this store reason being if the manager can get on here and expose someone personal business without their consent then that right there tells me he/she has no RESPECT for their BUSINESS exposing someone and lying is not professional, this business might not care but this company has lost a future customer.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Found the perfect sofa for our new apartment! Friendly staff and professional delivery team! With quality furniture and insanely good prices, there's no better option. Ikea? Wayfair? Amazon? Target? Nope. Buy from elegant AND get a deal better than those big corps!< /review>

So far my buying experience has been great, as a first time buyer from THIS furniture store they were really helpful and friendly but not over bearing. We were able to meet at a good price for exactly what i was looking for and unlike other furniture stores ive dealt with, the delivery was super easy and only took a day! Wish id gone here for other rooms ive furnished but definetly glad i know a great place to get exactly what i need at a good price for the future! Highly recommend checking them out first👍<//text>

<username>Marlene< /username><review>I bought a dinning set back in August 2019, I Paid $350 out the door, I was excited at first until 3 out of 4 chairs broke. the chairs are so cheap and not sturdy!

Edit 1/28/2020

I reached out to the manager back in December 2019 regarding my table, he said only thing he could do is order me a brand new table and he would sell it to me "his price" what he pays for the table, I asked If I could just pay for the chairs he said they don't sell chairs separately! still didn't fix it!! hate this place!! please REFRAIN from buying CHEAP stuff from them!<//review>< rating>

Very good quality and service. I ordered full house of furniture, four bedrooms sets, dinning room sets everything arrived in great condition. Definitely recommended to buy from Omar Discount Furniture and definitely will return again. Thank you very much!</Review>

Their furniture is poorly built and flimsy.  They use cheap wood, it's only been a year, and the color is coming off the bed frames.  They even sold me a bed with no mattress.  The other 2 beds came with a mattress but the third did not???  You get what you pay for... and these guys should charge way less.  I definitely do not recommend this place.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1561173000738, 'text': 'we sorry to hear this and you should make sure the furniture moved and asumpled in the right way...call us to see how we can help you if you need any pieces to be ordered 5593746671'}</Response><Gmap_id>0x80945d5ff4bbc24b:0x12a292a02c9c0d3b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I had a great experience with omar at elegant furniture store I found several dining table sets online and choose the one I really like. Salesperson was very helpful and knowledgeable about the products.  They confirmed that everything I wanted was in stock, and ready to be delivered to me, two days prior my order. The prices are best and on top that off that I got fee for delivery and assembly.  I would definitely recommend for your furniture needs.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1548967148590, 'text': 'thank you see you again :)'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Wow! I'm so glad I decided to read the reviews on this business before purchasing furniture I did notice a lot of 5-star reviews but what got me were the responses from the owner they were so unprofessional and very rude OMG! Now I'm wondering how many of the 5 stars reviews are true I want to thank the owner of Elegant Furniture for his/her responses to your unsatisfied customers on being so unprofessional on your customer services.THANK YOU for saving me the headache<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80945d5ff4bbc24b:0x12a292a02c9c0d3b</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Sammy, as a salesman sold me a living room and bedroom set I couldn't refuse. The furnitures where very fair if not more than great. I couldn't believe I got the deal that I received. I fully appreciate Sammy's help.<//Text>

As I was browsing on offer up, I saw a few furniture items that really caught my attention. As I went to the page the more I saw the more I wanted to find this store. I used Goggle to find the address. Clicked on the web and saw they also had financing. Once I was approved I went down and meet a wonderful sales man "omar" who made me feel as if we were old friends. The selection on the floor was great and I found what I wanted. The buying experience could not have been better!< /Review>

This place is horrible and the quality of the couches suck. Sammy is such a fake and will rob of your money. He cursed at me on the phone hung up several of times. He said he drops the furniture off and there is no warranty. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE ITA JUST HORRIBLE!!! SAMMY IS HORRIBLE !!!< /Text>

We recently moved into a small space and wanted a couch. After finding one we liked we purchased it and were told it would be available in 2 days. When the call came in we drove down to pick it up, only to find they had damaged the couch! They did not inform us, nor seem to care. The delivery men went as far as to mock my husband about the damage. Then the employee tried to STAPLE the damaged fabric back over the wood on the FRONT of the couch. After a bit of a fight we were about to get them to order a new one, however we would have to wait 4 more days. The next day my husband called to speak to the manager to ask if we could have it delivered, a normally $45 charge, for the inconvenience. His response was, and I QUOTE: "Heck no! It's only a few days, man. You can pick it up." My husband was so frustrated he hung up. I am shocked my the juvenile and disrespectful attitude towards their customers! I will never shop here again!

Update: about 30 minutes after the call, and the posting of this review, my husband was called and told that the couch is not longer available and to come in for a refund. After driving down the the store the OWNER told him "Look we still have the couch but you have to remove your review, it's bad for business." After some arguing he said "You are just mad we didnt give you free delivery!" and told us they refuse to sell us the couch now. So we got refunded a check. Seriously bad behavior for a business!!< /text>

Good quality for a great price ! We saw / bought the same couch that we saw on IKEA for 100$ cheaper at elegant furniture in Fresno. We were very happy with our couch and will come back for a dinning table !<//review>

<text>Horrible service. We picked up couch and the couch wouldn't fit in our house. They argued with us saying it should fit it's silly we are bringing it back. Finally agreed to take it back. Then had to wait a week to get a new couch. They never called it was ready we had to initiate the call. When we picked it up and set it up it was packed with no arms. So now we have to repack it up take it back and wait another week to get a new couch that has arms packed with it. Lazy people work here. I agree they are cheap furniture but horrible service.< /text>< pictures>

The whole process with The Elegant Furniture was smooth - we were able to pick the style, firmness, fabric and even the finish for the wooden legs of our couch at the store and the sofa was delivered even faster than they promised! Great service and amazing product.<//Review>

Everything was terrible here. The service was fake. Once they sold what they could and locked me in a contract they didnt keep to any of their word. The shipment was late, when the second crew of men arrived... I'm a single mother that lives alone.... they had no idea what was to be delivered.  Now thousands of dollars later I'm still dealing with them. My payment were complete and they are still taking money out of my account.  Over this place!! Please look elsewhere. I'm in customer service not into scam service.<//Text>

We order a sectional for you $299  two days later we got you the sectional ready for you to pick up and the box was scratched it wasn't my fault it's manufacturer defect. i told you dont worry we going to order you a new one the next two days and you said its okay I will wait for a new one because in the beginning you were discussing with your wife if you want to get the sectional or new one?  but you went start doing bad comments u and people that u know telling your false stories and u know why u can't do that. that's why I refuse to do business with you mad customer. We've been doing business in elegant Furniture 5 years and we have a lot of happy customers if they have time to write comments they could write more...and you will see us here in the next 25 years."}<//Response>< user_id>

I waited some time before posting this review because I didn't want Sammy the manager to try and cancel our refund. ANYWAY it won't take you too long to find bad reviews about this place that tell you how rude, unfriendly and INCONSIDERATE these people are towards there customers. My name is Marco, and my personal experience with them started off...well...bland and awkward but still not "horrible" (that comes later). My wife and I found quite a variety of very cheap sofas and bedspreads, the young man came to greet us, no smile, no hand shaking, no welcoming feeling really he simply approached us and asked "hello? Are you looking for furniture?" I was a little caught of guard by his lack of rapport building but decided to ignore it for the sake of cheap prices. We found a couch we liked on a Monday and decided to buy it full price. They didn't have it so had to be ordered, it took only a couple days to be delivered to their store. On Wednesday, when it arrived, I receive a call from an older man who's message for me was "yeah hi, this Marco? We have your couch. Please pick up as soon as possible" not friendly not asking me to do it, simply rude and sounded like he was annoyed that my couch was there. I show up and there are two unprofessional looking older gentlemen at a table, the drivers. I walk in, no one greets me, no says anything as I just sorta stand by at the greeting desk. Not until I literally cleared my throat and ask if i can pick up a coach I ordered. One of the "gentleman" gets up doesn't say a word, simply gestures to follow him. He takes me to a damaged box and says "this is the one" and walks away. The box has scratches and Knicks but WORST OF ALL the actual couch was damaged. A big ole hole right at the base of the front of the couch was there. I was shocked that he even tried to give this to me! I re-enter their shop and I let them know (as if he didn't know) that the couch is damaged. The guy, frustrated, gets up and goes to investigate. His response? He turns to one of his drivers and says "go get me staple gun"...wow...really? He then continues to STAB SILVER STAPLES into my BLACK COUCH. right in the front there, then he has the nerve to ask "you have truck?" I asked for a new one and he said it'll be here Saturday....4 days more without my couch. I left frustrated and ignored it. Spoke to them again on friday over the phone and asked if we can have the delivery drivers take it to my house without the $45 charge as compensation for delay and damaged goods. He refused and simply said, "it'll be here tomorrow, come pick it up tomorrow". My wife was furious and posted a bad review on their website, not even 20 minutes later they call me and say "yeah just come to the store we will write you a check for refund, we no longer have that couch." I go back to store again, only to discover Sammy was the manager and as it turns out he LIED about he couch not being there just so he can get me to the store and complain about the negative review my wife left and i need to tell her take it down how its bad for business. Anyway after arguing with him he wrote me a check for money refund saying he will not do business with me because we're bad for his business. I couldnt believe what i was hearing! But don't just take my word for it, go online and look them up. They have many bad reviews about their business conduct, their rudeness and not caring about their customers. I will never do business with them again and will make it a habit to let everyone know how terrible they are. They have been mistreating people long enough.<//Review>

My husband and I are looking for 2 dressers for our children's rooms. We were out and about all day and we still needed to get groceries so we decided to make a quick stop at Elegant Furniture since it was right next to FoodMaxx. We walked in and the store was empty besides a couple of employees . One of which acknowledged us but did not offer to help us or ask if we had any questions . It looked like he was in the middle of vacuuming and stopped and left the vaccum out in the middle of an already crowded floor along with the cord where someone could easily trip on it. The selection was okay. The store smelled like really cheap perfume so that plus the fact that no one helped us is why I gave this store such a low rating. There are way too many furniture stores in Fresno, you would think they would try to be worthy competition.</text>

<Review>Theres no other furniture store in fresno other than elegant furniture. They have great prices at very low cost. I was suprised when they told me the price of a queen bedroom set. I was very happy with my purchase. I plan to go back until my next paycheck. I also want to say that their store is spotless clean and elegant :) i cant wait for their holidays deals!! I am eyeing their chandeliers and their futon beds tho thanks guys!!< /Review><Rating>5</Rating><name>D G<//name>< pics>

Worst furniture store in Fresno!! Tru is a liar!  Said my furniture would be delivered on Thursday by 2pm.  Never came , and he never called to let me know.  So I called him the next day and he said by 12pm.  So I came home for lunch to wait for the furniture....didn't come til 10 pm.  Also my head board was damaged and my mattress is too small for the frame. It's supposed to be a queen size but it looks like a full size.   I will NEVER go back there again.< /text>

<Review>Horrible experience, didn't deliver furniture and charged me a 170$ restocking fee when I decided to cancel because of the run around they gave me.  Restocking fee? They never even delivered my furniture and the delivery driver said my order was not even on the truck! Other people were in there the same day I was similar  complaints...stay away. .

<Review>Sooooooo I had an interesting experience today...I was looking for some furniture for my new apartment and saw this place on Blackstone while I was coming back from work. I walk in and hear a customer arguing with what seemed like the manager. I stopped myself from going in and just listened, I'm nosey like that. ANYWAY there was a debate I guess about damaged furniture and money. I didn't think anything about it until the MANAGER BEGAN TO ACT LIKE A CRY BABY! Oh my god! From what I heard he friggin lied and told the customer to come to shop for refund due to missing product BUT he lied just to get gim into the store so he can complain about posting a bad review! I don't know what is going okn but a manager to act like this is completely immature. I'm not a customer but I will not be shopping here and will not earn my business unless that guy is fired.</Review>< Pics>

<text>I purchased furniture from this store and it took me over 2 weeks to get all my furniture. First They forgot My rails to my bedroom set.  I also got damaged furniture. There were holes in my box spring upon delivery. They replaced it but took a week to get it. Then when I got my night stand it had a crack at the corner of it. I also had to go and pick it up instead of it being delivered with the rest of the furniture because the salesman Tru forgot to include my nightstand on my receipt.I AM VERY UNSATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE I RECEIVED AND I WILL NOT BE REFERRING ANYONE TO THIS STORE!</text>< Date>

The delivery was on time as promised, i just wish the guy not omar that carried the stuff were more careful than just bringing it all together..i dislike it cause he scratched my walls(thats why i only give 4/5 stars)..but anyways, omar(sam brother) very good assembler and great guy..very thorough on assembling the furnitures..I dont care if they take long to assemble as long as its sturdy and well assembled...kudos! thank you guys! we'll recommend you guys to friends and family.<//text></record></dataset><record>

We love their tacos! The crunchy cod is my favorite. My partner likes the salmon and the carnitas tacos. The fresh ingredients and handmade tortillas make them so delicious! I highly recommend this Mid-City neighborhood Mexican restaurant.< /review>

<Review>Despite the fact it is a nondescript strip mall off of a Chevron station, this is a gem of a restaurant. Starting with the fresh salsa bar, then a taste of fresh juice, and finally I had two amazing fried cod tacos.

The servers were very helpful and nice. This is worth a trip up the 5 freeway to taste fresh seafood, new American style dishes, and awesome Latin plates. I want to try some of the pasta dishes and I really want to check out their breakfast offerings. Check this place out!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQT-Zdt2S2GkS0hTa_40QaajOlCT1Iur15do47=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMySs2v6y8d9aQMbp5plAM9SJTwERTV1qW5lQhg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-efE-OhGuhfdmpYp3iD3_7Aw64qr6V44tmyTv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxc6RXB0F9XNSYHnqTCV5PublBbYM3SYdg0GmG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg-lcS-VG1GXZmKm3GlE0e5IW-qH5bsqJpDwgG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvcbnytDPp9Hn3rRSrvnLgRDzFjJyxQy4DMwJV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

Fantastic food! This place has a little bit of everything but the Mexican food is phenomenal. All of the salsas are great (including salsa verde). Meals are reasonably priced (all of ours were around $10/each). Would highly recommend this place.<//review>

<review>Really good food! The black beans are delicious. The pinto beans are perfectly spicy. There's a sweet salsa I've never had ever & it's one of my favorites. The flavorful barbacoa tacos have as much meat as any burrito I've had before. The fresh chicken quesadillas, the organic kale & spinach smoothies made right in front of you, the cucumber lemonade... Just go already! You'll see me there for sure.< /review>< username>

EAT HERE BEFORE THIS PLACE GETS FAMOUS!!!

This place is a little treasure. Hidden behind a chevron gas station in what could be a neighboorhood described as the closest thing to the south side of Chicago that you can find on the west coast. Inexpensive food , OVERWELMING FLAVOR, the bbq tacos with the pineapple salsa, carnitas the meat lovers bennidict, lobster burrito, alaskan cod burrito anything else you can order, its all hand crafted and filled with deliciousness and dont cheat yourself make sure you get the honey salsa from the salsa bar♡ i cant believe this place exisit in this area, by far the best food around!! The only reason there isnt a line out the door every hour theyre open is because the hipsters are affraid to come in the neighborhood. The food is so alluring that you will come back.< /Text>

Food is delicious! Portions are great and pricing is reasonable.  I've been twice already and both times were fabulous. You may have to wait a little, service is a bit slow, but worth the wait. I recommend the Chicken Piccata, it was scrumptious.</Review>

<Review>Epic tacos! I ordered two veggie tacos from the green menu. As a vegetarian food, I am super impressed. They we're awesome. I also got a side of beans, that we're teaty and light as well. The service was also super friendly.

Cute little place,  family run.
I had a shrimp taco it came on a handmade tortilla stuffed with shrimp, cabage, salsa....and absolutely delicious. I also had 1 Carne asada taco it also came on a homemade tortilla and it was so good. I had the 2 tacos and Orchata for drink and I'm stuffed. They have a salsa bar with very delicious and different salsas.
I will be coming back, hope to see you here :)<//text>

Yesterday was the first time we came to that restaurant. But It is definitely not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the good service, with the exceptional  cuisine and booze and with the modest charge. We will absolutely visit there in a short time.< /Text>

<Text>Best Mexican restaurant in town! They're very generous with the portion sizes and everything on the menu is absolutely DELICIOUS!! More people need to know about this place. They even have a vegetarian/vegan "green" menu and they're super friendly. Highly recommend!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Such good food! Really fresh and delicious seafood. The tacos are huge and they hand make the tortillas. The burritos are giant and so good. They also have a great salsa bar, complimentary beans and roasted peanuts. The two ladies that work here are really sweet too.<//text>

I wish Google had an "update review" or "post another recent review" option - it would make life easier! Well, this place is great for some seafood! Staff is still awesome and food is still consistently cooked well! The pricing to portions after the six years of visiting this joint is still great! Overall a great one for a truly hidden gem! Their house salsa is addicting. Do not overeat and fill up with chips! Lol 😂 It's the red, slightly thick, lightly sweet and shiny looking salsa. They need to sell gallons of it because I'd buy it! Definitely stop in for some killer stuff. Takeout is excellent, too!

Park at McDonald's (plenty of parking) and walk around or on the street if you can't find a spot in the tiny shopping center lot. It's at a gas station attached to a 7-11 on a busy intersection so parking goes quick.

A year ago: Love the staff here! They're always so pleasant! The food here is delicious! We frequent RJM for our company lunches! All the seafood dishes here are definitely a must try! Especially the Ahi Tuna Salad. The tuna is always made to perfection! The prices and portions are reasonable, too. I only need two tacos! If you're really hungry, three is perfect but you will be stuffed! Their complimentary salsa bar is fantastic! Their red salsa is....addicting. I can't say enough about this place because the staff also makes every visit enjoyable! It's connected to a gas station so the only problem is parking! Other than that, a perfect spot when you're craving seafood!</Review>< Resp>

<review>I wanted to love this place I really did, but after eating here everyday for a week, trying many different items on the menu, the quality of the food just wasn't worth the price.  I was averaging $24 a visit with all the food, drink, and dessert I was ordering.  They are charging downtown LA prices in crappy Sun Valley.  Also the service is slow and of low quality.  The young guy who works there is incompetent when taking orders.  He has taken my food to the wrong table and flat out forgot to bring me my drink order.  I ended up walking out before my expensive meal arrived this last visit.  I'm sorry, but when someone is spending $20+ for food the service better be top notch.  I won't be going back.</review>< user>

Whatever you do, do not place an order online through their website. Placed an order online about an hour ago thinking it would be ready for when I came in half an hour ago and it is still not ready. Gal at the register pretended like the order was almost ready but when I walked away heard her tell the other gal that the order was never confirmed and placed with the kitchen. Not even an apology was offered.</text>

Second of all, if you're in a hurry or do not have patience, then this is not the place for you. Your food is not ready to be served when you walk in, you will have to wait.

The staff is super friendly and welcoming. When they bring you chips, feel free to go to the salsa bar, their salsa game is strong.

This is our second time here. My wife ordered and loved her strawberry French toast. I had the Angus steak taco, which I enjoyed. I would love to have one with just steak, a fried egg and some salsa, but I'm a simple person. I also had the carne asada and eggs. My food seemed to disappear. Everything is flavorful and well worth the wait.

As for the decor...listen, if you come here and you're more concerned with the decor than the food, honestly, find a nice chain restaurant to go to. I have been cooking professionally for more than half my life and places like this are few and far in between.</review></record></dataset><record>

Once you find this gem it is definitely worth the visit, great service, great food. The salsa choices alone are worth the visit, recommend the salsa verde.< /text>

Good food but they have a very big menu, at least 4 pages long, for such a small place. They should cut the large menu in half.<//text>

Food is amazing and has big portions. Just keep in mind that if they say wait time is 15min they mean 30. Totally worth the wait though.</Text>

<Review>Never disappointed here. I love the shrimp taco. The tacos are huge. Cost a little more than other places but one is a monster, and so much flavor.

< Review>
This place has everything for Breakfast , lunch and dinner , starting from pancakes to bomb Azz Carne Asada  , also shrimp tacos and fish tacos are huge and delicious here
100% recommended for those who loves to enjoy their food , delivery is another option for those who don't like to drive , so just call them , order some Huevos Rancheros , and wait for 30 minutes and someone will be asking for you at your front door,
Parking is always empty , gas station next to this place , auto parts store next to them too ,
And Hair Salon as well,
RJM is just one of the best restaurants here in sun valley CA , I work near by and I always call them fo deliver Service , sometimes I just go in when I have time , inside is very clean so organized , the guys are always doing something trying to keep it clean , there's a lot of tables too so is good for groups , big families , meetings etc etc , also some cops likes to come here and have a lunch so this place is so safe to theirs customers , their prices are fair enough , lil bit high but fair enough , fair bcuz the quality of their food is top priority for them , this place is not like any other taco restaurant , this place is just the best restaurant , only bcuz the quality and quantity in your plate , food looks good taste good and you feel like you just spent your money in the right way and you will come back for another round for sure , guaranteed</Review>

This place is a hidden jem. Not the average Mexican grill spot in that they have different types of dishes than that of your average mexican food spot. Service needs improvement tho. Usually get this young girl and she's great. Not worth it of she aint here in my opinion unless u get togo</Text>

<Text>Salsa bar wasn't up to code  all the salsas were at room temperature and fruit flies were all up in the salsas  and had beans right next to it that werent hot . They had a chick doing phone orders and taking orders for us she was a hot mess yelling all mad .. she was a young  loud girl .. maybe have 2 people up front cause she couldnt handle it . ..she was asked to clean the salsa bar she didnt do it .. they ha d like 6 guys in back on the orders allover the food was okay  some was to spicy for us .. they also aadertise lobster but they didnt have any we tried thos place cause it had 4 stars but not close its like a spicy baja fresh flavor anyways seems like a busy restaurant if u like spicy< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Company refused to honor warranty.  Wanted me t troubleshoot their dead camera.  Explained to them I don’t work for them. Replace equipment and do your own troubleshooting.  Promised I would get a call back after an hour.  Two days later no call.  Called back.  Agent would not speak with me, was not allowed to; said only a supervisor could speak with me about this.  Also agent said he was putting me on hold.  In the meantime spoke with my partner.  Agent was listening on private conversation without permission.  Was talking about complaint I had filed with BBB in Phoenix against Nest.  Nest corporate is located in Palo Alto, CA but complaints are handled out of Phoenix. Agent came back and stated he could no longer talk to me since I was filing a complaint.  I asked him why he was listening in on a private conversation.  He denied listening in although he was repeating the conversation I had had in the expectation of privacy since I was supposed to be on hold.  Since I am in Kentucky, I am legally allowed to record calls without informing the other party.  I did and advised him of the fact he had just been recorded and caught lying.  Three hours of being on hold today and still waiting on a supervisor.  My equipment still has not been shipped!  They still have not honored their warranty!!!  This company is the worst!!!  I hope the BBB has better luck.  If they don’t litigation is next.  AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS.  THEY ARE THE ARMPIT OF THE WORLD.< /review>< username>

Man, The Dining Room cafe is probably my most favorite Google cafe. Just the high quality and variety of delicious food they serve for lunch is very satisfying. It rarely disappoints.</Text>

I had the peanut butter bar with milk chocolate and hazelnuts. It was pretty delicious but the peanut butter wasn't peanut buttery enough. Price was a little high but good customer service.</Review>

Would I come back: HECK YEAH!

Pop: 4/5

Mixed Berry with dark mint chocolate - Best customization ever.  Such a simple idea and I'm shocked it hasn't caught on anywhere else.  I felt like the pop was more icy than sorbetish but it was tasty.

Service: 4/5

Friendly service and good with explanation on the process.

Ambiance: 4/5

It's a small shop but the outdoor seating is nice.< /review>

< Review>
Delicious. I always walk by here after a game but they're usually closed. It was a Friday night and they were open later. Definitely recommend. I got the chocolate carmel popcorn option off they're popular menu.

Staff was really friendly and helpful. They have a large variety of dippings and toppings.<//Review>

They make their chocolate their I believe so sometimes their out of some but have multiple options. The Popbar itself is the perfect size just the right amount before you feel like you gorged too much.< /Review><UserId.>110944567480705520856<//UserId.><resp>None<//resp>< Rating>

wish they had more places like this in jersey, this place is super cool! I was too full from lunch to get anything, but I tried some of my boyfriend's and his sister's and the idea behind it all is really cool. I know if I had one of these close to home, I would go to it all the time.<//Review>

<review>I was skeptical about going in but was pleasantly surprised with the flavor offerings and the variety of toppings. It is also a very filling treat and a novel experience. It's a good place to drop by right before your movie.<//review>< username>

Fresh ingredients and delicious toppings to choose from. I came back the next day to try there shakes and that also did not fail.< /Review>< pictures>

Excellent lesson by Richard! He explained surfing in  a simple way that I will remember when I get back in the water. I will know what I’m aiming for & when I get it right. Very relaxed & easy time hanging out with a guy who enjoys sharing his love of surfing.<//review>

We enjoyed our first surfing experience with Kyle. We were able to pop up and catch good waves, thanks to our instructor! We are now planning to get our own board and wetsuit to continue surfing more. Thanks for a wonderful intro to surfing! Will return for more lessons.<//Review>

<text>Easy to schedule, very responsive and communicative, and outstanding service. I bought a 2 hour lesson for my sons 12 birthday and he had an absolute BLAST. It was his favorite gift by far, and after the lesson he was beaming. He had a great time, learned a lot, and it really boosted his confidence. He was up and surfing after just minutes in the water! 10/10 would recommend.</text>< resp>

Dave made a little surfer out of my girl in one session! She was very hesitant, but he made it relaxed and fun so that she fully engaged. She literally didn’t stop smiling the whole time and can’t wait to do it again!<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Dane was a great teacher. Our whole experience from booking our daughters surf lesson to completing the lesson was fantastic. We have one other experience with a different company to compare  with and we will most definitely return to Learn to Surf. Dane informed us on wetsuits, the thickness differences and why, How to put on a wet suit and was very patient. He answered our questions on boards and where to buy and what to look for and did not give us the most expensive name brand ideas or options. He shared with us whatt beaches are safe for first or new surfers. He taught our daughter about rip tides and how to ride that out. He was not worried about being on a board himself but totally focused on his student. He finished the lesson at the van and by the end of the two hours we left feeling like we met a new friend. Our daughter was nervous at first and ended relaxed and excited to return for more.  We will most definitely return and bring friends. And who knows the non-surfing fans in our family just might snag a lesson up at big bear too and learn to snow board through Learn to Surf. 😀</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

We can’t say enough about how much we loved our experiences (love it so much we took two lessons in 3 days!) with Learn to Surf. Our 13 year old daughter is a beginner and they did a fantastic job helping her gain confidence and skill. The staff is professional and the instructors are great at their craft, fun, careful and encouraging. They went out of their way to help make our vacation extra special. The Newport and Huntington beaches were beautiful and we consider the surf lessons to be the highlight of our trip. This is a top notch group and we highly recommend them!<//text>

I had a great private lesson with Dane. He was very informative, always remained calm. Because of his instruction I had more confidence being out in the water than I’ve had in awhile and I feel more prepared to go out on my own now that I have more knowledge and experience from the lesson<//Review>

We had such a great experience! Awesome service. Easy to book. Our instructor Brandon provided great one-on-one help to our nine-year-old daughter. She was able to stand up several times despite a difficult high tide. Definitely a worthwhile way to spend the morning. Super memorable experience.</text>

Wonderful experience!  1. My call was ACTUALLY answered! Jason is professional,  approachable and focused on meeting the needs of the client.  Top notch response and business! After booking, email confirmation and directions texted within 5 minutes.  I knew where to go, what to expect AND my hellcats would be in great hands.  2. No surprises! Great location (even with bigger waves it's shallow and my boys had plenty of "long rides"). Equipment was top of the line, easy for boys to carry and maneuver. 3. The instructor (Brock) was AWESOME!  Engaged two "competitive" brothers (ages 9 & 10) with different learning styles and personalities(!) in a way that left both feeling it was, "the best day EVER!" Brock was mindful of ones hesitation and helped his confidence grow.  He reinforced general water safety and flexible problem solving while also getting them pumped and completely stoked on surfing!  This island girl couldn't be more pleased!  WARNING:  One lesson might end up costing more when you get hooked and then need to go buy your own gear ;)<//text>

<review>These are surfer dudes, not gift store owners who rent surfboards. The equipment is good for beginners, but their delivery van looks more like they might have a side hustle as housepainters. Again, these are surfers, so don't let the creep van detour you! I mean...these guys do need some help with marketing....but not surfing! Big wave Dave had us surfing right away. Felt very comfortable. He had us in some very manageable waves....my first surfing DIY experience in Oregon left a sour taste in my mouth, but Big wave Dave and Southern California waves made me ready to go again! Highly recommended.</review><GmapID>0x80dce0130aeeb865:0xac67272a343d6d24</GmapID>< Resp>

I got this lesson for my wife for her birthday.  She loved it and was standing and riding waves in the first 30 minutes.  She said it was the one of the best days of her life. She had so much fun and the instructor was incredibly skilled and friendly. Totally recommend this company!<//Review>

<text>We are visiting from Northern California and made a last minute call to sign our 3 teens up for surf lessons. So glad we did! Kevin was great!  He was so nice to our kids, patient, and taught them to surf!  I highly recommend him and Learn to Surf!  My kids can’t wait to go back!!</text>< Name>

<Review>My daughter and I took lessons with Chris. He told us we were learning on the biggest waves he’s seen all season long so we were both really nervous, but he was calm and patient and put us at ease. We were both able to get up after a few tries. This was totally worth it! Loved our experience!!!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Absolutely enjoyed our lesson, my sister and I were provided with excellent instructors. I did some research comparing different surf academy's, I vouch that this one does it's job well. Plus, if you take your lesson in the morning at Newport, you might get lucky and surf with some dolphins. Definitely will take lessons again.< /Review>< pictures>

Great experience. Jason was very professional and easy to work with. I had to reschedule and it was no problem. My daughter and I had a lesson with Chad and it was awesome. He was really friendly, informative and had a great chill vibe. I recommend these guys very highly.</Text>

Highly recommend for all levels of experience! Instructors are super friendly and helpful. They have everything you need to surf, no need to bring anything. They were able to take my sister and I day of! So they are super accommodating. Seriously our experience was so great! We had so much fun and would do it again with them. Would highly recommend to everyone!< /Text>

Great surf lesson with a bunch of amazing instructors out there I brought a group of my friends down to the beach and we had never surfed before.  2 really cool instructors Chad and Zack took us out for one of the best times of my life.  The boards they had we big enough to float me...im over 200 pounds and I feel like I walked away from the lesson with a new understanding of the ocean and how to surf. Thanks guys I will be back.<//review>

My fiancé and I took lessons this past weekend and they were great! Will was our instructor he was super chill and helped us learn to surf with ease. Even though we ate it quite a few times, Will was really encouraging and helpful when it came to catching waves and giving us foundation skills for surfing. If you’re looking for a place to learn pick these guys over the competitors simply for the price, services, and staff.</review>

< review>
I had such an amazing experience surfing with Will. He is super calm, patient, clear & thorough in his instructions, helpful, and has tremendous physical strength & stamina, which was certainly needed on this crazy day! The current was stronger than I’ve ever witnessed, and the waves were so monstrous, only very experienced surfers could be out in them, so we were restricted to the shallow “foamies,” which were so strong they were literally knocking me off me feet. I would have been carried away numerous times if Will hadn’t told me to get up on the board and he fought the current, dragging me & the board out to the waves. He did this repeatedly for 2 hours!! Dedication and stamina!
With his instruction, I was able to get up with every wave, even if I didn’t always stay up for very long. By the end of our 2 hour session, we were both pretty exhausted, and in my mind I knew it would be my last wave. Thankfully, it was the BEST wave and BEST ride I had all day! I stayed up and rode to my destination, jumping up & down for joy when it was over!! It was EXHILARATING and well worth all the effort! We both agreed that this was the ride to end the day on. I would definitely go out with Will and his team again, and can’t wait to have my three daughters learn to surf with them too! (I’m proof that these guys CAN teach an old dog new tricks.) And I definitely recommend the picture package and the GoPro camera package. It was so amazing watching the videos later, as it looks different on video than I see it in my mind. And you can see what you’re doing right, and what areas you need to work on.< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Took a paddle board lesson with Dave as instructor over the weekend and had such a great experience! I grew up terrified of the ocean and never learned how to swim. I requested we stay on shallow water and the lesson took place in a beautiful area in Newport where the water was pretty shallow. Before my lesson, Dave showed me how to float in case I fell off the board, which I did! I slightly panicked when I fell but remembered what Dave thought me and was so proud of myself to be able to get back up on my own! Dave stuck around really close just in case so I felt really safe! It didn’t feel much like a lesson, but felt like we were just hanging out having some fun! My teenage nephew loved it too! I will definitely be going back and recommending this adventure to friends! Thank you Dave for helping me conquer my fears!<//text><gmapID>0x80dce0130aeeb865:0xac67272a343d6d24<//gmapID><userid>107192091191111204786< /userid><time>1591068382014< /time></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
From start to finish, a great experience.  I was a little hesitant because there's no actual building to go to.  A van with all the boards and wetsuits and even sunscreen parks at the end of the street.  It worked out great.  Jason, who runs it and answers the phone, was professional and friendly and I felt confident by the end of the phone call that my kids were in good hands.  Because I booked for four, he threw in a second instructor for free so they'd all have more of a private lesson.  Next time, I'm including myself in the lesson!  The two instructors were top notch.  They are passionate about sharing the joy of surfing with others and are very knowledgeable.  Brock has an incredible story about how he ended up in Newport Beach.  Unfortunately, I didn't catch the other instructor's name (but can describe him to a tee) but next time we go I'm going to ask for either or both of them.  They got them up and riding waves and I could hear them cheering them on from the beach.  My kids are in their 20's and I couldn't have asked for a better experience.</Review>

Lewis spent most of his time with the 11 year old as the adults had some prior experience but we all stood up on our boards and rode them in.  The only thing I wish was different was having the option to keep the board and wetsuit for another couple of hours once we were familiar with catching waves.< /review><user>103756700329472654818<//user>< Rate>

Brock and Jared were great!! We’ve taken about half a dozen surfing lessons all over the world and they were by far the best. They covered the basics of safety and catching a wave, but also explained how to find and catch a wave by ourselves by the end of the lesson. Great way of making the process easy, understandable and safe. We took my 15 year old niece for her first time and she got up on the first try and was catching her own waves by the end of the two hour lesson! Great experience, highly recommend.< /Text>

If you’re thinking about taking up surfing this is definitely an excellent start. The instructors are extremely encouraging and knowledgeable, you’ll definitely leave with a sense of readiness for future wave adventures.< /review>

I hadn't surfed in four years because of dealing with family health issues, and I'd never been more than a beginner before then, so I wanted to find a surf school where the focus was on safety. Brock was my instructor. He's a super nice guy and really worked hard to make sure I had a great day. I can't remember the last time I felt so happy and relaxed. Now, I'm hoping they offer package surf lessons!</Text>

My daughter and I had a WONDERFUL experience with Learn to Surf. I called  the morning of, having decided to give myself a surf lesson for my birthday, and having a hard time finding anyone who could fit me in. Jason was determined to fit me in. Our instructor, Ben, could not have been nicer. I appreciated that he took technique and safety very seriously in the initial lesson on the sand. In the water he watched us closely and commented on what we could improve each time. When we were struggling with a certain part of getting up, he took us back to the sand to practice again. We were much improved after taking that break to fix our form. It was so fun and we learned so much! I actually loved that we just met them at a van--that I felt there was no unnecessary markup. The van had our wetsuits and boards, and we were able to lock our valuables in. I really liked the choice of beach, as it was a learning beach that wasn't intimidating. We will definitely be back for more lessons from Learn to Surf!<//Review>

there were 4 of us that took lessons, first of all we had a GREAT TIME!!! there were 2 instructors, unfortunately I am very bad with names so I can't give their names but one instructor was from the Canary Islands the other was from San Clemente, anyone who is surfing for the first time probably knows that you do not learn to surf in 1 lesson, but I think what you are finding out is are you interested in continuing to learn, our instructors were incredibly nice and patient, as bad as we all were they continued to praise us any time we were even remotely  close to doing anything that resembled surfing, they even praised us for the effort we were giving, safety was their first order of business everything was explained in detail on shore and I felt confident that my family was safe while under the instruction of these two gentlemen, the boards were supplied as well as wet suits, we originally were scheduled to take the lesson at Huntington Beach, when we were called it was recommended that we take the lesson at Newport Beach because the current and waves were not as strong, that turned out to be a great suggestion as the location was much less crowded and the conditions were definitely  safer, I can't say enough good things about our experience, if you are planning lessons these are the right people, thanks for the great time and experience!</Text>

<Review>First off I have to say that this experience exceeded my expectations 100%! Brock showed me all the ropes and I was up on that board first try! I could not have been more excited! Brock was absolutely fantastic... you can feel his love for surfing and respect for the ocean in how he teaches! For anyone looking for a killer lesson and hoping to get up and actually surf.. these guys are LEGIT! Thank you Brock and of course Jason, for making my little solo adventure
A-mazing ♥️< /Review>< Response>

<Text>It was my first surfing lesson in the US.
I’ve learned from Brock who’s been surfed 10years.
He taught and guided me the safety and how to surf as a beginner.
I've tried another surf workshop before once, I’ve never popped up.
But then in this lesson, I've pop up many times and I enjoyed it with him.
I felt intimidated about learning new sports before, but now I found it is fun and I'd like to keep try surfing.
Thanks for cheering and guiding!</Text>< rate>

<text>Brock was awsome with the kids but I didn't get what was discussed and what I was paying for. I wanted to book off a deal site for a go pro package for my daughter first time surfing so I called to ask some questions. Then I was told I'd get the same deal booking directly. I did that for two days and only got the go pro package for one day and didn't receive photos yet it been two days since. :( really said I didn't get the captures I was looking for.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dce0130aeeb865:0xac67272a343d6d24</Gmap_id>< rate>

<text>We were on vacation in Huntington Beach and my daughter decided she wanted to learn to surf. We went to a place right on the beach and arranged something for that Saturday. Came back Saturday morning only to figure find that their instructor went to Hawaii. I'm guessing they should have know that before Saturday. Anyway I called learn to surf and I'm so happy I did. She spent two hours with Chad learning about surfing the ocean, feeling the ocean and was up on like her 3rd or 4th wave. One more thing to add to the list of things my kids will never have to look back on in their life and say I wish I would have tried that. If you're in Huntington go locals like these guys way better than the mass market stuff on the beach. Thanks guys.< /text><Resp>None</Resp>< Pictures>

I brought my 2 kids in for a private surf lesson and the instructors here did such a great job we came back in for 2 more lessons while we were on our vacation. Definitely would use Learn To Surf again.  Can't wait to come back next year.</Text>

My instructor was Kristian and he did an amazing job. This lesson was my first time surfing and with Kristian's help I was able to ride stand up and ride several waves during the course of our lesson! It was so awesome. I couldn't recommend these guys enough!<//Text>

Booked lessons for surfing and paddleboarding for a large group offsite.  The whole operation (main office back-and-forth, instructors, gear etc) was professional and we had no issues.  Our group loved the event and I would definitely recommend Learn to Surf.  Thanks Jason and team! :)< /text>

It was really difficult on deciding on which surf school to choose because there are so many options out there on yelp. However, after reading about Learn to Surf and Jason's safety training in the Navy, I decided to go with him. He was really thorough and able to communicate all the terms associated with surfing. I had no idea how complex surfing was, but he broke it down very simply. I learned basic positioning and paddling techniques and half way through my lesson, I was riding every wave I paddled into. I'd definitely go back to learn to surf and I recommend anyone trying surfing for the first time to check out this place.<//Text>

As a transplant from the midwest, I felt as a new OC resident learning to surf was a must! Jason and his team of instructors have been able to make me feel comfortable and safe in the water while learning how to paddle and stand up on waves (and I am very uncoordinated!). I have had multiple lessons with Jason (the owner) and some of his other instructors as well. They are helping me perfect and grow my skills as a surfer! Thanks guys!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Professional purveyors of surf lessons...we only hire the best most trained instructors who's main focus is on safety.  I adapted my training program from the training I went through in the US Navy.  I went through both SEAL and dive school training and make sure all my instructors go through a battery of tests to make sure you are safe during your surf lesson.  A lot of other surf schools make outrageous claims of being the best out there, but have no credentials to back up their assertions.  I am college educated and received my degree from the University of Hawaii where I rode every big wave on the island of Oahu.  Come train with us and have the best surfing experience of your life.

<text>Quick day hike out from the parking lot to Round Lake. Only a few hours round trip but a lovely hike through the valley, over the ridge and down into the next valley where Round Lake sits. Good lunch spot at multiple locations around the lake and several camping spots too.</text>< Pictures>

<review>You start out on the trail at a moderately steep climb which then turns into switchbacks and when you reach the top the forest opens up to this absolutely beautiful meadow with a meandering brook through it and it's just absolutely gorgeous.</review>< name>

Lots of parking in the shade but get there early especially on the weekend because its popular. Trailhead can take you in a couple diferent directions. Clean and well maintained. Large dumpster for garbage.  Vault style toilets.<//Review>

6 miles, 3 in to the Round Lake 3 back.  It does go further of course.  This portion involved a large uphill that made the better portion of the 1st half of our hike rough but getting out was easy.  Definitely a moderate trail!< /review>

<UserId.>116523053311108791011<//UserId.><review>From Big Meadow trailhead to Scott's Lake is a great moderate hike for a person in moderately good shape. Some stepping up boulders but very good footing. Not too much altitude change on this leg of the TRT. You do have to walk/run across the freeway at the start. Pit toilets available at the trailhead with no posted trail map. The well trodden trail was easy to follow, but I didn't see blazes that you would need for snowshoeing.

Pretty Aspen trees.  The lake was low - my big dogs were still wading 15 feet from shore.  I ran into about 15 people on a Tuesday afternoon - four mountain bikers and the rest hikers.

Took me about 2 hours round trip at a brisk pace with a 15 minute break at the lake for the dogs to swim.</review><rate>5<//rate>< pics>

I have no clue what's keeping this place open because it's so god awful. It is a disgrace for Quickly to call themselves a boba store, it's worse than anywhere else I've ever been. I'd euthanize myself before going back here again. If you value your time, money, or mental stability, go somewhere else!<//Review>< Pictures>

The place looks run down and very dirty. There's dirt on the walls and the bathroom is nasty. No soap either, but that doesn't matter, you can't dry your hands anyway. Not sure how this translates to food sanitation, but has me worried. We do like Quickly in general, but this particular place seems to be struggling at the moment.</Review>

Last coffee stop before heading out of SanFran and I wish I would have known of it sooner. Nice little place to just relax. Not much for scenery because it's by an alley, but great spot to enjoy your coffee and chill.
Will be my spot next time I'm here.< /text>

Very similar to other quicklies.  Nothing spectacular but it's close to campuses (schools and colleges) and honestly compared to other places their turn around for a drink is pretty good as well.< /review>

<Review>Hmm, what to say. I tried to go to the one in Pleasant Hill but apparently that one was closed so Google needs to update their info. This location does accept paper and plastic so that's a plus. This store however didn't really look cared for. Just kinda looks dirty. The guys working were nice. My order tasted fine, nothing great about it. It came out in a timely manner and that was that.< /Review>< Pictures>

Worse experience ever! I was skipped in line. My order was completely wrong and when I asked to fix it they still messed it up. When confronted they just gave me what I asked for but in a smaller size. We asked for the size we want and she just gave us a dollar thinking it will make it up.</Review>

Easily the cheapest and most authentic boba around. I recommend jasmine milk tea with
lychee jelly. They have many many topping options and a massive menu. They do not serve everything on the menu, however. At nights and weekends the place can be very busy. Service is often very slow. Overall, this is the best boba place in central county if not just for the value.< /text>

If you need to get your bubble tea fix, this is the place to go!  Strawberry milk tea with the large tapioca is my go-to drink.  It can have a funky smell every now and again, but the drinks are definitely worth it.  This location also accepts credit cards!  Only one of the few Quicklys in the ara do this.<//review>

So, I'm pretty sure the "Quickly" for its name can be applied to the drinks they make, but definitely not for the food. i went there for an hour lunch break; big mistake! It took 30 minutes for the food I ordered (a fairly simple noodle bowl) to be be made. Even then, the food was poorly made. The chicken was slimy and the soup broth was really generic. Not very flavorful.

After eating what I could to make it back to work on time, I started feeling sick an hour later. My stomach clearly didn't like the food.

Go there for your drinks, sure, but definitely not for the food!<//Review>

<Review>The wait here can be ridiculous. If you're standing in line behind 4 people, you can expect at least two people to order an Oreo shake, which takes the cashier a few minutes to prep. I've waited upwards of 20 minutes to get my order in on a basic Jasmine Milk Tea.

This is a decent place for a no-frills, cheap milk tea. If the line is too long or you're willing to spend a little more, try Boba Loca on the other side of the plaza, or Sharetea in Todos Los Santos. Chances are driving there will be faster than waiting in line here for your order.< /Review>< date>

Great place for a varied selection of teas and bubble teas and general munchie foods.

I went to this location when it opened because it accepted cards, which the one by DVC did not. Unfortunately the last time I went they had changed to cash only, and there are no convenient atm's nearby, so plan ahead, or go to one of the vietnamese places nearby for your bubble needs.< /Review>

Loaders are great!!
But Some dispatchers think they are doing us a favor.
If you are at the window to pick up  your bills and they see you and do not bother themselves  to serve us only when they decide, while you can wait all damn day if they wanted.</text>

<text>Called in to check if product is ready was told it's ready to go. Checked in at 11 am was told they just gonna call, he's went by asked again in shipping was told it was first come first serve and I wasn't told that from the beginning especially when I called and was also told 2 trucks ahead of me so still waiting for another hr or so. Checked back in again cause saw more than 2 trucks getting doors. Was told product was just being packed and still needs to be cooled. 6 hrs later still waiting..not coming back here..I get the run around BS..< /text>< name>

Parking area is huge, you shouldn't have any trouble finding a spot without the sun right in your truck. No overnight parking, and I've never seen a food truck here, but the loaders do a good job and the wait time isn't the worst.<//Text>

Very nice place but the older lady in the office is very rude!  She screams at customers! We hired on as workampers, our spot was on a side of the road, every one drove by, no privacy at all! We left after 1 week!  I guess several left prior to us arriving!
Would never go back!!!!</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Good place, a quick charge from between the pole, which came loaded, lasted an hour, fifteen minutes, it was fast, free scale to weigh yourself (free)
NOTE: it only lacks that they water the patio a lot of dust
From there everything is fine

It was taco Tuesday and I requested some spicy quesabirria tacos from the taco truck in the expansive outdoor beer garden. I asked the beer tender what would be best with spicy tacos and they recommended the lemon sour. It was the perfect pairing!< /Text>

It’s nice trying a variety of beers. I’m still drunk making this review. Can’t wait to go back (: I didn’t want to leave ! The valley sunrise & save the planet were winners. Also some 11% beer that smelled like coffee c;< /text>

Definitely one of my favorites in the Fresno area. Staff and security is always friendly. Service is quick and their menu keeps your staples available  while alternating new beers so you get variety to choose from (tap or cans). I haven't bought any of their merchandise, but maybe in the future.</review>

Hot pretty drunk
Good people good customer service
Good local brew
Just be careful because for the drinks are so good you won't feel them until your ready to go
Get an uber or DD driver ready lots of cops around that area</Review>

<review>My family and I came here expecting a goodnight out for a few drinks after social-distancing for a long time since the beginning. If I could give it a zero I wouldn't hesitate. But my experience here has been nothing but trouble since I arrived. Story short, if you're Asian and expecting some kind of normalcy, don't expect this place give that to you. We were targeted the whole night. Date and time: March 20, 2021 @ 7pm til dark and voluntarily asked to leave.</review>< pics>

<review>Good beer. Good times. Good people. Worth a visit. I've been here half a dozen times and always enjoyed myself. The beer is consistently been good and the crowd and the stop have been super fun. if you go on a night when you've got food trucks even better. Gather up a few friends and grab a few beers.</review>< Name>

Great atmosphere and music. Staff was pleasant and easy to order from. Every brew I tried was excellent. Bathrooms are super upgraded and clean. Only reason I gave four stars is the seating could be a little more comfortable. Might just be the fact that its raining too. I will certainly be coming back.< /text>

Great place, excellent staff, but be advised due to Covid19 restrictions by the county,  you must purchase food with any beer. The kitchen is NOT open at all hours, do call ahead to make sure its open, so you can enjoy a pint or sampler flight outside on their patio. Higjly recommended!< /Text>

Came here for a Yelp event before the Fresno Foxes game and I will definitely be back. This place has delicious tasting craft beers. The great part is that it is actually family friendly. They have corn hole and a few games set up. Food trucks are available to grab a bite to eat. The food selection is definitely good. When I went they had gyros and a Cuban sandwiches. I got Cuban sandwiches and they were good. The awesome part was after the game, we were walking past to go to our car, and the security guards were welcoming us back in since we had our wrist bands. The atmosphere is enjoyable.  They have the DJ playing from the afternoon until closing. Definitely coming back</Review>

Came from out of town for a family baptism and wanted to check the local brewery scene. This place did not disappoint. It was a Noodles event and place was fun family atmosphere. Whole lot of different eats variety of beers. Would definitely come back when I’m in Fresno. Tried the Zorro, Half Dime and 99 all were great.< /Text>

Patio doesn't open till 5. You may only buy package until then. Very deceptive hours listed. Call first before you drive a long way and feed the parking meter. The employee was very nice.< /review>

<name>Roberto Farias<//name><Date>1552853604558< /Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Coolest spot in downtown Fresno without a doubt. It's incredible we have this brewery in the heart of the city. On any given night of the week there's an event. Either trivia night , loteria or live music. Most days they have a food truck. A few times if year they host special events and shut down the block. They have a game room now and they have corn hole and foosball. The beer is outstanding. The cure beers are solid and the new stuff they put out constantly is amazing. They have heaters and fire pit tables when it's cold and an awesome patio area when it's sunny. Swamp cooler when it inevitably gets to be super hot. Very dog friendly and often you'll see people bring their furry friends, myself included.This place is truly a gem in Fresno.<//Review>< pictures>

If you like craft beer, you will love this place. Well staffed and run, close to fwy 41, plenty of parking and there almost always something going. Concerts too</Review>

Tioga Sequoia's back yard feel is a hit. Any soccer and baseball game your bound to lose yourself in the environment. Five star score for downtown Fresno CA. Well down fellas< /review>

My favorite local brewery. They always have something new on tap as well as several reliable core beers. They also have many events so it has become the cornerstone of Downtown Fresno.</Review>

Consistently growing better beer, food and culture in Fresno by supporting and using locally sourced artists, musicians and resources. For all sorts of Fresnans- from families, friends, foodies, to fans alike.</Text>

I was at another Brewery down the street and ran into I believe the owner and his wife of Tioga there.  I am.not from Fresno as I had flown in from Colorado.  They were incredibly welcoming and kind.  We talked and they told me about their place down the block.  I went here and what great beer, staff, and just a fun place to hang out.  I can't recommend this place enough.  It is a must when you are in Fresno if you enjoy craft beer.< /text></record>

Loved the friendly, and fun atmosphere. The Bartenders were super friendly and informative. The Fulton St IPA is delicious!! Even the dark and heavy midnighter was surprisingly delicious  with what seemed like hints of coffee??!

I will definitely come back.< /text>

With live bands, vendors and food trucks to curb your appetite most day's there is something to do or see with your friends, family or going solo is just as fun. The craft beer's there are the most talked about when I hear anyone speak of drinking beer and it's not hard to see why. They have a wide variety of different beer's on tap and in bottle or can. Plus there is something for even those who don't drink alcohol like root beer, Kombucha tea and simple clean water. The staff is kind and always ready to help and keep the place very clean. The atmosphere has definitely improved over the years and I'm very happy to say they now have indoors public restrooms! It's a great place to come to after work or just to drop by and grab a few cold ones to go. I can't wait to see what they do next and I look forward to my next visit.</review>< Pics>

Love the spot and the beer is delicious! Very open atmosphere and they have special events every now and then that are good to go to. For me, I got to do the beer and yoga and it was a lot of fun! 😊 Will definitely be back!</Text>

Tons of beer on tap with alot of verity. The beer garden was clean, well kept, had tons of seating, and many TVs inside for sporting events. The service was prompt and the beertenders were very friendly. I hope to make it back soon.< /Review>< rate>

A large group of coworkers went over to TS after work.  One of the people with us was acting as DD and ordered a non-alcoholic root beer.  It tasted very off in terms of carbonation and flavor to her but was too shy to go up and talk to the beertenders.  So I went up and explained the situation and was simply told, "That's how it always tastes." with no further attempt to remedy the situation.  I then asked if he would taste the rootbeer (maybe the keg was about to blow or something?) and the beertender reiterated the same sentence with some attitude the second time and then turned to the next customer.

It's disappointing that responsibility with drinking is at odds with the customer service we received.  Additionally, I hope they resolve the porta potty situation with more permanent facilities at some point.<//text><Date>1534533600895</Date><username>Katrina</username>< Resp>

I would also like to apologize for the behavior that was expressed to you from one of our employees and we would like to look into this matter more (to better prevent it from ever happening in the future.)We are unsure if the same keg of root beer is on tap from last night but we will have members of our team look into the root beer that we have on hand.  If you would like to respond to this message with more details or perhaps email me at Matt@tioga-sequoia.com I would gladly like to see if there is anything we could do to help repair the issues that you have brought to my attention. I would also like to share that we are currently working with a contractor on a solution for permanent indoor bathrooms to be built, we plan to advertise it heavy once construction on those has begin.'}<//Resp>

We're from Northern California and discovering and enjoying local beer is one of our favorite activities. It is not often that we find ourselves in Fresno, but last weekend, there we were. Having been introduced to Tioga-Sequoia's "Half Dome" a wonderful, unfiltered California Wheat Ale, by a friend, we wanted to try their other offerings.  The brewery is downtown Fresno, and offers some of the finest brews I've tasted. Unlike most small brewers, Tioga Sequoia has a large number of beers to offer. Just to mention a few...Tamarack is a nice amber lager, 99 Golden Ale was my pick along with their Half Dome. Kathy couldn't get past the Cucumber Pilsner. Cucumber Pilsner? Yes, I tried it and like it too, it's crisp and lite and begs to be drank in the heat of the day.  Now if you think Cucumber is special...Try their Piece of Cake Stout!  You bet ya, Cake Stout, with it's hint of chocolate it's just what we needed for a upcoming birthday celebration. It was a Wow experience...we were very impressed with the fine folks and friendly reception that we were provided at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing. Oh Yea, the Beer is Great...we loaded up on the four beers I mentioned and headed back to Dixon...smiling all the way.< /text>
