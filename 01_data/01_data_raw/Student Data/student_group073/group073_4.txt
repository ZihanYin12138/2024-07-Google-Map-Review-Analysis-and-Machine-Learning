If you ever need our services again, we'll be happy to see you."}< /response><Review>My expectations going in to Macco was just a quick fix to my dented up truck with an old tired paint job. I had many very high quotes that were way too high for a semi-old truck. The body work came out great, they hit my budget, and gave me a better paint job than I expected. There was a little bit of an over spray issue but Irving (manager) was very courteous  and willing to do anything to keep good customer service. Overall I was very pleased with my service and have already recommended some friends to call Irving.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dd33ae5b25301f:0x9d066f3765c92da8<//gmap_id>< date>

The overall paint job was great. However if your picky about your paint, you better let them know in great detail what it is you want before they start the job. They painted over the original factory pinstripes and the chrome moldings that go around my car. It didn't ruin the car, it just doesn't have pinstripes anymore and there is no more chrome moldings. But like I said it wasn't a big deal because the paint job was great and the moldings were to old anyway. Overall, I'm satisfied. Only thing that was lacking was attention to detail.</review>

< review>
I am thrilled with the work Irving and his Team did on my 2005 Mercedes C240.  It was a mess when I brought it in. Irving looked at it & then took the time to show me what was needed to restore it. It had been destroyed by someone I never should have let touch it. Irving and his expert team took the time to correct the damage done to the fenders, remove the cheap paint used and they transformed it body and paint job. I love it and I am so proud to drive it. Lily was always available to tell me exactly what was being done and when it would be ready. The price was very economical and worth the final job. I would highly recommend this Team at Maaco to anyone wanting expert service at a reasonable price. Thank you so much Irving. Please thank your Team. I appreciate all your kindness and understanding Lily.< /review>

Speed of service was impeccable..brought it in on Monday morning and it was complete by Thursday morning. I was so excited to see fresh paint on my car after 5 years of the original paint slowly coming off. There was even a spot on my car that was cracked, but I denied repair on simply because I don't plan on having the car much longer (and didn't care to spend an extra $200-300 to have it fixed). When I picked it up I was surprised to see that the crack was no longer there and Lilie informed me that the guy who painted my car went ahead and took care of it for me because he knew it would look bad. 10/10 would recommend! Thank you Lilie and staff for making my car look brand new! I attached before and after photos to show what a great job they did.<//Text>< rate>

<Text>I took my vehicle in to get a free estimate and was told I couldnt get a estimate due to the "body guy" wasnt in on a Tuesday at 1:30pm..... okay..... I brought it in a second time a week later and the "body guy" miraculously was in. He greasily looked over my vehicle and told the estimator a outrageous estimate price (to basically make me go away) and gave a lame excuse of not wanting to work on vehicles that were "older" meanwhile a truck that was 15+ was sitting in the paint booth. Long story short I took my car to another Maaco and had the work done at a quarter of the estimate that the "body guy" said. Dont go unless you like spending more money for less quality.</Text></record>

First of all thank you Maaco,...a few years ago I took my car to get painted at this shop and they did a great job. Then when someone ran into my car and damaged the left side I had to replace the fender, door, mirror etc... my car then was three different colors, So back to Maaco I went, and hard to believe I think they did even a better job this time. The value you get for the price they charge is great. The staff is very knowledgeable and professional. Thank you Irving and body tech Antonio, GREAT JOB!!!!!<//Text>

The staff went above and beyond in helping us with the process of repairing our car after being rear-ended. The manager, Ms. Lillie was absolutely wonderful and helped us along the way in dealing with the less than pleasant experience we had with the other persons' insurance. Paint job was great. Only one thing, the drivers side door handle was painted over and the other handles were not. But regardless, I'd go with Lillie and her team all over again!< /Review>

I had my Honda painted at Maaco in Long Beach last week and am very pleased with the quality of the work. Irving and his crew did an excellent job at a very reasonable price. Great customer service from the moment I showed up for the estimate all the way through to when I picked up the car.  I will happily recommend this business to my friends and family.< /Text>

< review>
***Stay Away*** Mexicant's-I called Maaco yesterday since I have had other Maacos spray my classic cars.  The Long Beach location and on call manger "Irving" stated they could touch up 2 spots on my 1990 Corvette and just bring the car by the next day at 8:30 a.m.   The so called "manager" was 30 min late and then thought he could waste my time by telling me they could not do the job.  Although I realize it's a production job, since I have owned my own classic car restoration business in the past I thought a so called "manager" was aware of his job and what cars he could not touch up. He was just another young buck working for min wage with no accountability issues. It's not my first Rodeo and since you thought you could not take responsibility and try to pawn me off to the real manager, you are receiving this review and many others. Learn your job or obtain additional education about how to be professional in the work place and see how this really effects the company you work with in a very negative way. Does Maaco  corporate teach customer services skills 101? You are now have wasted my time which is infinitely more important than yours.< /review>

This place did an awesome job in getting my bumper fixed. They were willing to work around my budget when it comes to getting the parts I needed.

My daughter recently had her car painted here.   The cost was very reasonable.  They have a lot of options available for painting your car,  from basic one coat paint jobs, to multi-coat with clear coat paint jobs.  But make no mistake, this is a chain brand,  so if you're looking for a custom, show car level paint job,  you'll need to take your vehicle to a shop that specializes in that.<//review>

I had a great experience at this Maaco location.  The staff was courteous and friendly and answered all of my questions. My vehicle was done by the estimated completion date and it looks great.  I would highly recommend this Maaco location to anyone looking for a paint job on their car or truck at a great value.< /Text>

Staff was honest, considerate of my budget, detailed in their explanation of the process, and very quick to complete what I was honestly expecting to take nearly twice as long. I appreciate the staff's dedication to professional and honest work.</text>

My 8 YO daily driver was in need of new paint after 150K miles and mismatched color shades from previous body work. The new paint looked much better than I expected. Very minor overspray and orange peel but for the price it's to be expected; it's not a show car. Wally and Kevin were more than helpful. She's good for another couple of years. Will definitely recommend for sprucing up old grocery getters.</review>

I drove over to Macco to get an estimate on painting my new hood to match my cars factory paint. The guy looked at my car and told me 300 to just paint the hood and 500 to blend the color with the rest of the car.  I personally thought that was too much considering there a $300 total car special.<//Text>

I had the trim painted on my Jetta .
Kevin was very easy to talk to. He told me exactly what he was going to do and how much it would  cost.  They did a very good job, I’m extremely pleased.
It’s only been a few days, hoping it lasts a very long time.

May 19, 2017

Got my SUV painted and it was very well done.
Customer service excellent, Ricardo was in charge
of the car and at the office Lillie made sure the
special rate for Maaco customers be applied by the
rental car company, Isabel was very helpful.  Work
was done and delivered ahead scheduled.  I saved
time and rental car charges.
As a satisfied customer I highly recommend this shop
for your car.</Review>

Great customer service over the phone. Have yet to get a part painted by them but will be stopping by over the coming weekend.

Quick and super-late update but I had a rear bumper painted in factory black for a 2014/2015 Nissan Sentra and it looked like new! Thanks for the great work, Maaco.<//Review>

I brought in a 1997 Honda Civic that we used to be embarrassed to be seen in...the paint was so bad, peeling, oxidation, etc. I figured anything would make it appear better, but when we had it painted I was shocked at how great it turned out. It looked fantastic. The job was top notch and everyone we worked with was very professional. Brought it in on a Saturday and was finished on Wednesday. Thank you!<//Text>

< Review>
After taking my car to get some body work fixed; my driver said door looked like someone tried to pry it open which caused more damage to my locking mechanism. When I told the manager he said they didn't do that and there's nothing they can do because they don't handle mechanical work. They didn't complete the job the first time and tried to tell me that I didn't tell them that; when it was clearly written in the initial assessment. When I asked for an original invoice for the parts they claim were from the dealer. they refused and said it was against company policy. NEVER will I recommend this place to anyone nor will I ever go back< /Review>

They were out of something for just about every item I asked for. They gave me two large lemonades with NO ice in them and when I asked for ice they were rude and annoyed. The strawberry lemonade was just syrup dumped at the bottom of the lemonade cup. Overall just wasn't a great experience.<//text>

Most of the albums and artists I was looking for were all out, but If I could I would spend hours in here, the selections are amazing. Some albums I would have never expected to see anywhere else other than online. One staff member was VERY helpful and kind, and the prices were great! I'm looking forward to coming back soon <3

<review>Longtime resident and am impressed how long they've been around! I got awesome help to navigate what I was looking for and great recommendations.

Not only is it just Vinyls, they got Cassettes, CDs and did I see some 8Tracks? Plenty of old school players and receivers to pump up your analog or newborn digital devices.

Be mindful to others as the space is cozy!</review><GmapID>0x80d954da960df983:0x1e32e64b1d45d907<//GmapID><Time>1606956835139</Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Name>Andre Couturier Maitret (andrecm)<//Name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6UKZhwPzJD2GrKTgfiDHIGHdofL5-ViJv5U_7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< user_id>

I walked in and I ignorantly took out my phone to snap a picture because it looked pretty cool inside (posters and records all over). The lady working there rudely yelled at me to put my phone away. There were no signs that said to not take pictures so how could I know? As soon as she barbarically yelled at me, I immediately walked out of the place.

<review>I have been a customer at Taang records for years. It’s always very well stocked with one of a kind collectibles and a hidden gem. The owner and staff are very kind to talk to about music, especially if you want to expand your music tastes. It’s my favorite record store and I love the 2 dollar crates! Plus, it’s always very well stocked with good old fashioned punk rock, especially the ones from their label. It’s my go to when I need a little spice in my life. Definitely recommend!< /review>< Pics>

Really cool vinyl shop! Great staff and crew! Great place to put your local band LP in!! Support local music!! So much to choose from.  If it is on vinyl, this place probably has it. LOTS of collector vinyl to drool over.< /text>

A music store for all kinds of music records and album lovers. Would recommend this place for a significant collection of records for every type of Artist, album, genre. Plus they have a vast selection of other media as well. I have never been steered wrong here, or pressured to act like i know my music... Talk to Curtis, the owner, he is usually there.. mention the type of Artist, or genre, or any music idea you are after, and you'll receive straight forward amazing recommendations. I'm currently listening to Hardcore group "Negative Approach" and absolutely smashing my steering wheel.. And Battalion of Saints is waiting next< /text>

<review>Edit: I see the owner responded to my review literally a year and a half later. RECORD COLLECTORS- DO NOT SHOP HERE! THEY WILL TRY THEIR HARDEST TO RIP YOU OFF!

To the owner: “I don’t know what you’re talking about” doesn’t fix the terrible service I received (and still remember) over a year ago. Try again!

My original review:

If I could give 0 stars, I would. I was told that I could buy a specific record from their store, but due to a mistake that they had made, they would need me to wait a "short" period of time before I could pick up the record.

After over a week of being ignored and dissatisfied when I was doing nothing but respectfully  and patiently trying to make this transaction happen, I was finally told that the record could not be sold to me because of its condition- even though I had been told the week before that it was in mint condition.

At this point, I had gone to and from the store four different times and I had spent 2+ hours waiting patiently at the store for some sort of answer on when the record could be sold to me. I only did this because I was extremely interested in purchasing the record and giving them my business, and I made sure to present this as patiently as I could. However, patience is clearly not rewarded at this establishment.

It's a shame, had this not happened I would have been a loyal customer.

TL;DR: The owner does not know how to run a business and would not know the ins and outs of customer satisfaction if it hit him in the face.< /review>< gmap_id>

Best place in SD to find records and some gems. You will pay a high price but they have some EXTREMELY hard to find records. Cool shirts and gadgets, wish they had some more option tho for shirts.</Review>

< review>
Great store! Been there twice on my travels, and most recently spent about an hour chatting with/being grilled by Curtis and co about records I've heard, records I hadn't heard, things I should buy etc. It was like a non-stop lecture on music history from two walking encyclopedias who could yell down the aisles randomly things like, "top ten kiwi punk singles from before 1980!" and the other would have his list ready to go without a moments notice. It's hilarious that there's so many negative reviews, because this is a record store, not Walmart. These guys are record store guys, they "know everything", and they probably literally know everything. It's par for the course. I walked out with an armful of new records, some they gave me for nothing, and a head full of new facts and stories. They are not your servants - this is THEIR house! Amazing place.</review>

I went in my high school days, I brought some stuff to trade in and was looking for new stuff to buy, the guy immediately seemed bothered to even check out my records.
Then he tells me my records are scratched and can only buy them for a dollar a piece.
When I decline his offer and browse the store he then proceeded to hit on my girlfriend in front of me. Never been back. Never will Go back. Overpriced records.<//Text>

If I could give it less than 1 star I would. This shop is an absolute abomination of a representation of what the hillcrest community represents. Don’t walk into their shop unless you’re willing to play their games and rules. Before you purchase memorize all the songs of that band and be sure to be able to sing lyrics. They don’t care for people who are adventuring their taste in music. They are extremely judgmental, rash and discriminatory of people of all kinds. The management team is completely biased and unprofessional.<//text>

My friend called the phone number to see if they bought gently used Disney vhs tapes. The gentlemen said yes, bring them in, Jessica is buying today. We drove 20 mins to get there and as soon as we walked in, the girl looked at us and rolled her eyes. When she told her she was there to sell the VHS  tapes, Jessica told her they don't buy vhs, only take them as a donation. She said forget it. Then Jessica turned around and walked away from her. I also had CD's I wanted to sell and Jessica didn't even acknowledge I was there.
BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE JESSICA.< /text>

He’s from Boston so he has that personality. I believe he would rather not sell you a record and keep it on the wall. You ask him a question about a record and he just puts you down, gives you that negative vibe.
Once I was at his store when they were located on pismo ct and I wanted to buy a misfits record for 450.00  so I tell him I want that record on the wall he proceeds to tell me he can only accept cash, he couldn’t accept a credit card because visa would take a fee from his profit since record was from his collection, he didn’t want to pay a fee, I had already taken my max out of the atm for that day, so I asked him to hold it for me I will be back tomorrow to pick it up, so he says ok, I come back with the cash and when I show up to get the record, he told me he changed his mind about selling it, I was totally bummed out because it was something I really wanted and I drove 60 miles for nothing.
This was 19 years ago now that record is worth more, I wish I had it. I would have rated him 0 stars but the minimum that your allowed to leave is 1.  Bad business practices and his bad attitude and expensive prices.<//text>< pics>

R(A)D!!! ...one of the last real punk shops left in the world. After like 20 years of purchasing   music from the TAAANG! mail-order sheet I finally made it to the legendary hardcore/punk/Oi! label's physical record  shop in SxDx & I gotta say I was far from disapointed! Killer selection of rare originals on the wall for the serious collectors lookin' to drop some loot, & plenty of newer, reasonably priced reissues for the kids who missed it the first time around! The dude behind the counter was more than helpful & there's so much cool stuff that I can't wait to jam back down there! Highly recommended to any punkers/skins/new-wavers/death-rockers/metallers/etc.< /Text>

Did business with Taang a few times selling a few items. Went okay the first time then they wanted us to leave stuff for them to look at later. Took 4 months to get money for a receiver we dropped of and then they lost a whole trunk of blues records and said we didn't give them anything and kicked us out. Gave back our trunk that had the records in it and said we dropped off an empty trunk. Owner kinda has a thing for buying blues records and it just so happens that is what mainly disappeared. I have never had a worse encounter with a business owner in my life.< /Review>

<review>Large selection of old used records. I ask where all the metal albums were(my personal preference) and the dude rudely pointed at an area and walked away. I went to the area to find artist like abba, Fleetwood Mac, and other old stuff I had no interest in, Again just personal preference, But cmon I asked for a specific genre and got the opposite. Way over priced, records crammed in bins, slightly overwhelming. Was extreamly disappointed with the whole experience, called prior to going in, employee was extremely rude and short with answers. Won't be returning.</review>< rate>

<Text>Way over priced. I travel the country for work and visit shops, and this is by far the worst priced store.  Records that should go for $20 are selling for $50 or more.< /Text>< Time>

(Translated by Google) Wow? !! ?? !!

ლ (= ↀωↀ =)

Let's talk about demolition at this place. I picked up some records from the discount bin and they raised the price. They should really consider refurbishing the pricing system so that they can know the price in advance. Instagram sellers have found that they are more honest with record decisions than those offered in the store.

うわー？！？!!

ლ（=ↀωↀ=）

この場所での解体について話しましょう。私はディスカウントビンからいくつかのレコードを拾い上げ、彼らは価格を上げました。価格を前もって知ることができるように、彼らは本当に価格設定システムを刷新することを考えるべきです。 Instagramの売り手は、ストアで提示されたものよりもレコードの判断に正直であることがわかりました。

Small neighborhood Korean restaurant with friendly staff/owners. You do not cook your own food here. Lots of delicious menu options.</text>

I love their food.  Crispie battered Veges.  No fat on the bulgogi, great kimchee, & the lady that works there is so nice & remembers my special requests.  It's clean & comfortable there.  Clean bathroom too.  Inexpensive!  Very conveniently & litterally on the N Line's path.  1/31/20: this location seems to have better tasting food compared to the one on Polk St.  Another very good meal, & the same waitress here for over a decade.  I tip at least $30%.<//Review>

This is my go to spot for Korean BBQ. I got the meat mountain 🔥🍢🍗🍖. It was so good. The flavor was great. They made it a little spicy like I asked.  It was a smokey heat.  The service was very good. The lady was super nice. Very friendly.< /Text>

I haven't been here for almost 11 years and wow the taste is the same as it was. I love there soup and their bulgogi is still the best. They have very friendly staff and service. Took my family and loved it. We going to make this place a regular spot for us. Thanx Hahn's Hibachi.< /Text>

It's cheap, but tasty. Perfect for a quick bite. With so many other tasty places to eat in the neighborhood, it's not my first choice. But, sometimes I crave BBQ pork, so I go here. If you need a quick lunch, check out their lunch menu. You can get a decent lunch for under $10.<//text>

It was pretty good, a bit pricey for some of the food. Expected a little better given the reviews but not worth it in the end.</review>

Ordered a take out and extremely disappointing because I expected Korean BBQ (the sweet and spicy Korean sauce) like most other Korean BBQs.  BBQ beef and ribs were like marinated with a salt solution — not much flavor except salt.  The side salad was nothing more than pieces of iceberg lettuce.  No Kimchi at a Korean restaurant?! For almost $40 for 2 plates of poor quality food.  Sorabol Korean restaurant chain is 100x more flavorful, less cost, and comes with a side of house made kimchi.

I can’t believe reviews are so positive about this place — won’t be returning.< /text>

Sometimes, you just want a tasty bit of BBQ Korean ribs!

Here at Hanh's you'll get that and so much more. They are super fast and friendly serving up fantastic lunch specials. When I'm craving some rice and spicy teriyaki chicken I head here instead of the Panda Express across the street. For about the same price you get chicken, rice, salad, two pot stickers and two tempura fried shrimp. It's enough to share, or do what I did and eat the whole thing and regret stuffing yourself full of goodness later!</Text>

Advertised as Korean BBQ but they just bring out premade BBQ dishes. Other than that deception, the food is decent. Our bibimbop was pretty good, excellent kimchi. Sundubu was a little on the tasteless side, but still good.< /text>

<Review>I am truly happy with our experience here so far. Cecilia has been a HUGE deciding factor in our apartment search. She is cheery and helpful no matter what. The few snags that I encountered during move in only went to show how helpful she really is! She even help lug our heavy furniture to our apartment! All the other staff members are incredibly responsive and helpful. After viewing a lot of other apartments it was Cecilia and her team that really made this apartment feel like home.<//Review><Response>{'time': 1614820853957, 'text': "Thank you for sharing your positive feedback with us, Cameron!

Cecilia played a HUGE role in us choosing Deerwood and we were not disappointed. From the first office visit to us moving out, she has been such a graceful, helping hand. I learned from her that not all apartment management staff are hard hearted and rude. They can be kind and look out for your best interest.

FYI we moved here in the middle of covid while I was 8 months pregnant! I needed a good clean environment and peace. I got everything I could want. A big apartment, clean, updated, and nice grounds to take a walk and enjoy the sights.

Also, the office staff is very responsive. They will respond promptly to phone calls/ emails.  Maintenance requests are handled quickly as well, as there is an online system.

I consider this a nice, safe place to raise a family and will recommend it to everyone!< /Text>

We had an emergency blockage in plumbing over the holidays. Our bathroom tub and sinks were blocked and flooded. We had to call Deerwood emergency and Luis Chavez attended to the problem. One of the best experiences. He was on site very quickly. He got to work immediately with a cheerful, friendly attitude. He was very professional and did a meticulous job. It was a real pleasure to have him take care of the problem. 5 Stars and a big shoutout to Luis Chavez.< /Text>

<text>I absolutely love living here.
The community is amazing.
It’s beautiful and peaceful. The sounds of the kids playing and knowing that they are safe here is so refreshing.
I love walking my dog and meeting other friendly pet owners. It’s just an amazing place to live. Fernando is so quick to do all service repairs within a 48hr max. window, sooner if needed 👍🏼

Side note:
I had recent surgery and could not walk my dog, distraught and not knowing what to do, Cece (leasing) stepped up and not only walks him for me, she is so loved that she was able to recruit a few teenagers to help.
They would do anything for her!
She’s  the most amazing person...whether she is working or not, she makes sure stop and talk to you just like you’re a family member.
Thanks everyone at Deerwood...
Cece, Alex and Brian!
Major 👍🏼 Up

I love my new home!!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dbf7390f92e33b:0x265bf719e781b568<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

The whole team at Deerwood has been extremely helpful in finding us the apartment that checked off all the boxes! We didn’t get to tour the community before we applied so Brian helped us with our application and confirmed that the apartment we were applying for had everything we were looking for. Alexandra showed us around the community when we finally were able to visit and was personable and patient (I have a one year old who wants to walk and do everything herself) so the tour  took a little longer. We didn’t get to see the actual apartment we were moving into since it was still occupied but she showed us an apartment that looked similar. Cecilia helped us on move in day and she is just as amazing! She has really great energy that just brightens your day. She is very thorough and informative and helped make our move in day easy. She even helped us find a parking spot to make unpacking a breeze. Our apartment was even better than we were expecting. The space is great and it’s so open and bright! It definitely feels like a home and has a great community vibe which is exactly what we were looking for!< /review>< pictures>

<review>Worked with Cecelia from first time visiting to moving in. It is amazingly pleasant experience to work with her. In fact, all people in the office are great. they are very nice and kind.
The quality of the property and the maintenance is great too. It is very safe place, quite, comfortable. Very easy to access highway, lots of shopping facilities nearby.
My son is enjoying playing outside on the grass or in swimming pool with many other kids. very kid friendly environment.
It is really a great place to live.< /review><response>{'time': 1535730579970, 'text': "Hello and thank you so much for sharing this review with us!\n\nIt's a pleasure to have you as members of the Deerwood community and know that our mission is to make this a place that you are proud to call home."}<//response>< Date>

<review>They have been talking about installing cameras for a long time. A house was broke into and several cars, military serving people had their things stolen. They said there was nothing they could do. Mind you the things were stolen were almost 7k. We are paying almost 3k a month for this place, if they still want people paying these prices they need to do something about security. I loved living here because I felt safe, now I feel like this place is way overpriced and they don't seem to care. It isn't a safe haven anymore.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I was already approved in Little Italy,  upon my last search of apartments/condos I found this gem...
The wood-ish like area is unique and charming, the apartments inside are clean and feel like they are updated or newly remodeled, borderline luxurious...the area is close to work.
That wasn't the best part, the best part were the people who run the community. They didn't put any pressure on me to move in because they want to fit the right people into the community and so far every neighbor I've met has been pleasant. Cecilia made me feel right at home when I met her, and I have to say she is at least 50% of the reason I chose Deerwood. Super sweet to deal with, actually seemed like she cared and it felt more like a friend helping me move in, rather than a landlord. I also worked with Brian who helped me quickly and was very responsive. The mountain to hike behind is great for running with your dogs and is accessible within 5 minutes of your front door. Dog cleaning stations everywhere, very quiet, fireplace...almost every person has a dog, very pet friendly the list of pluses goes on, and I thank my lucky stars I found this place, my dogs and I love it. Thank you Cecilia, Brian, and Alexandra. I truly love my new home and plan to stay a while.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dbf7390f92e33b:0x265bf719e781b568</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Pro's: Staff is courteous and friendly.

Con's: Parking is hard to come by if you have more then one car expect to walk a couple hundred yards to your apartment if you get home late or work nights.
Rent is expensive, and if you don't renew your lease for another year and decide to do monthly, expect your rent to increase by $1,200.</Text>

I first moved here in late February with my roommate, and the experience has been nothing short of great. We needed to move in pretty much immediately and the staff were very accommodating, especially Alaisja. Sure, the prices are a little high, but the area is extremely nice and the cost is well worth it. The staff are friendly and courteous, the apartments are virtually soundproof, and the community is lovely. Highly recommend living here.<//Text>

Like every apartment complex, Deerwood has its PROS & CONS

PROS: all the women in the office are extremely kind and so helpful, the community itself is well maintained, neighbors are really nice, family oriented, very safe place, has a small park with enough running space for children. The apartments here are very spacious with updated features. Everything about the apartment features are really nice. Maintenance team is so kind, and they do fix your issues but sometimes they will take up to 6 days to go to your apartment. If you have children, and love the pool, I think it’s awesome that Deerwood has a separate pool for kids. During the day it’s very quiet, and peaceful. Especially if you want to take a walk around the complex.

CONS: I had so many issues with the water temperature in the shower. No matter where you turn the knob, the water will either get extremely hot or very cold every 5-10 seconds. The office doesn’t really answer their phones all the time (I have had to call up to 8 times needing help with something) and the sad part was, when I went to the office, I saw their door open and I called again to see if they would bother picking up, and they didn’t. Parking becomes a HUGE issue after 5/6pm. You will more than likely not find a parking spot after those times unless you own a carport (only one carport comes with the lease, you’d have to pay for a second monthly). My biggest regret with living here is choosing an apartment closest to the street, Camino Del Norte. I cannot stress enough how terrible it is at night time. If you are not used to constant noise or floors/windows shaking dramatically, you will NOT sleep. When big cars or trucks pass by, your floors, and windows will shake drastically. It feels like an earthquake. It also doesn’t help that the windows make a loud noise while they shake. I have spoken to my neighbors about it, and they also experience the same, they hate it. Every family guest or friend that I had overnight complained of not getting any sleep whatsoever because of the street. I personally think the rent should be much lower on the apartments near the street. You WILL be sleep deprived until or IF you get used to it. My advice, don’t choose a unit next to the street. I am being 100% truthful on this and not being dramatic at all. It really is an issue. The good thing is, they give you about 2 or 3 months for you to choose if you want to remain in the specific unit or move to another at no cost. I stuck with it because it’s a hassle moving in the first place. I’m sure any other unit away from the street would be ideal. In my apartment, you can hear the pipes in between the walls pretty loudly in the middle of the night, it’s bad. I have been woken up many times because of it. Another major downfall, is the gym. Truthfully, it needs an upgrade. Has a beautiful view of the pool but that’s the only good thing to it. They don’t really have many machines to choose from. The gym overall is just unpleasant.</review>

We chose Deerwood Apts for our family after downsizing from a very large home on several acres. We love our 3 bedroom apartment with it's front porch, vaulted ceilings, and large back balcony. The office staff are friendly, kind, efficient, on site and always available. Maintenance are polite, respond as quickly as humanly possible and do not leave a mess. Landscaping is tended to daily. The trees, grass and plants are beautiful. There's ample parking. Individual storage cabinet for each apartment located under assigned carport parking. We took advantage of the extra storage available on site for a nominal fee. The apartment location is within walking distance to a dry cleaner, barber shop, pizza shop, upscale pub, sandwich shop, and more. The apartments are located within the Poway Unified School District. Most importantly, Deerwood Apartments is a safe place to call home.< /Text>

<Review>After selling our home and looking for an apartment we came across Deerwood.  We narrowed our search down to three locations in Rancho Bernardo.  Deerwood was top over the other two because of the location, size of unit, and the staff.  The property is laid out nicely with lots of trees and hiking trails.  Brian at the front office was amazing making it so simple for us on short notice.  Everytime I popped in and with no advance  notice and  limited time Brian immediately stopped what he was doing and showed me the unit and went over everything with me.  I can't tell you how easy he made the transition for us.  We are in and settled now,  and have a lovely light and bright unit facing the open space hiking trail and we  are very happy.  The neighbors are nice and we are glad we choose Deerwood over the other locations.< /Review><username>Nelly Malone<//username>< time>

<text>So far so good. The place is beautiful,  the area is clean and easy on the eyes. It appears people pick up after their dogs and it is quiet for all the animals around the place. The only drawback for me is hearing the neighbors upstairs, but it isn't too bad! Parking is sufficient but the trash is centralized, so if you live far away, you have to haul your trash pretty far. Otherwise, it is a great place to live. There are shopping centers all around. There's caramel mountain road with the plaza which has a lot of places to shop, target and another shopping center on the other side of camino del Norte and if you stay on Bernardo Center Drive, there's shopping there too. Close to the 15 freeway, makes traveling nice. There's a pool, gym and playground. So far so good there!</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>If you're looking for a delicious sandwich at a good price, I recommend this place! Which Wich has a wide variety of options. You can check off the sandwich you want on a piece of paper at the front. Then you pass it to the cashier. I made it a meal with a drink and chips. The only downside is that the parking lot is tiny and it's a busy plaza. So I recommend that you park on the street.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4mKhVO7PdJmLi-YHEEDgC6rEnXAZxIkAhWZxw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

Which Wich does have tasty food... soft warm bread melted cheese and your choice of meat.  However it was nearly $10 for a regular sandwich (witch) I thought was small no side no drink just delicious bite to eat.  It was my first time here so I did not know to take a bag from the wall and fill it out to what you want on your sandwich.  There are some TVs inside if you eat there ad bottomless fountain soda.< /review>

<Review>Great sandwiches. Nice staff. Quick service.
But it is recommended if you prefer online. You'll get rewards that way.
Sandwiches are tasty. Tastes different than subway sandwiches. This is the 2nd time i tried the sandwich here. I think i am going to come back here for lunch again in future.</Review><Time>1518127590025<//Time><userid>114631528529664053722</userid><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

Quick and solid sandwich for the price. I got the "brunch wich" for $10 and really enjoyed it!

I'll be coming back when I'm around and looking for a quick bite.</Review>

NEVER AGAIN BUYING FROM THIS STORE!!! Had an order for delivery that never got, called the store to tell them i was going to pick the food instead just for them to tell me that food was on the way(after an hour wait), another hour went by and still no delivery. Called store to get a refund on food just to get told that the food was supposedly delivered and that they would pass the message to manager when he got back.
3 days went by and got a hold of another manager "supposedly" that said was taking care of that issue to get my money refund on food i never had delivered, a week went by and still no reply or money back.
If i could give them a minus 5 star rate ill do it in a heartbeat, worst experience ever buying from them a product i never received!< /review>

Don’t waste your money.  If you are near the Belmont Which Wich location, you are better off going to Mr. Pickles for a “real” sandwich!  The sandwiches at Whitch Wich are so small and they are cheap with the meat  toppings.  I ordered their Krab Salad sandwich and it was ALL bread.  Subway’s gives more meat than this place, and that doesn’t say much.</review>

<review>Probably the slowest Which Wich I've ever been to.  If you come in for lunch, make certain you peak at the chain of pinned up brown sandwich bags before ordering. If there are more than 8, be prepared for a long sandwich wait, even with no line and 3 employees behind the counter.</review></record>

<review>Superior sandwich.... hmm I don't know about that.

Which Wich is a catchy name just wish their sandwiches were as good as their name. I came in wanting to grab something quick before my workout and decided to give this place a try. It's sandwiched (yes, pun intended) right between Starbucks and Five Guys in a plaza with teeny tiny parking. I came in mid-afternoon so it was pretty much empty and I had all the time in the world to decide what I wanted. With their set up, I can imagine it would be a push and shove type situation to get your order in and I don't want to be all up in that.... no thanks!

So first you start off by picking the brown bag that a has a list of stuff you could possibly want in your sandwich. The brown bags are sorted out by type of meat so don't grab the wrong one! For this occasion, I went with turkey but they had a ton of other options like beef, italian, veggie, chicken, etc. After you select the brown bag, you grab one of the red sharpies and start creating your beautiful masterpiece of a sandwich. They also have specialty sandwich meat types on the top, for example, the turkey one had thank you turkey which is thanksgiving turkey which is pretty much your thanksgiving turkey meal in a sandwich or turkey reuben which comes with saurkraut and thousand island. I went ahead and picked the Thanksgiving turkey because who could pass up stuffing and cranberry sauce? not this girl! I also added lettuce, cheese, saurkraut (can't get enough of this stuff), banana peppers, and mustard all stuffed into a wheat roll. You also have the option of getting it cold or hot (but getting it hot takes longer). Once you're done with your brown bag, you hand it to the cashier and pay.

My sandwich took about 5-7 minutes, it wasn't that long since no one else was there. The workers were pretty friendly, they talked to me as I was waiting for the sandwich. When I got it, I was surprised by how big it was. I guess I thought 7" was a little smaller, so that was a happy surprise. However, I did not like how mushy my entire sandwich was. I swear, it was like 85% stuffing and then 5% cranberry sauce, and the last 10% was all the other stuff which includes turkey. Where was the turkey?!?! I ordered the Thank you turkey not thank you stuffing sandwich -_- and for a hot sandwich, it wasn't that hot either. The sandwich was underwhelming and I didn't feel like it was worth the $7. But if you're a hugeeeeeee toppings fan then this is your joint because Which Wich has a lot of choices.

If I do go back, I'll give the shake a try since that seems to be popular and not the turkey, thank you.< /review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) BANH MI This is very delicious, and it tastes exactly the same as Chinese meat.

(Translated by Google) I like Which Wich, but what about here, do you want me to do more thorough cleaning in the store? It doesn't mean it's not hygienic, but let's wipe the table occasionally ...

Also, I feel that the taste is inferior compared to other stores, and three points.

(Original)
Which Wichは好きだけどここはなんかこう、店内の掃除をもっと入念にやってほしいと言うか。不衛生というわけじゃないんだけど、たまにはテーブルを拭きましょうよ……

あと、他の店舗に比べると味が劣ってる気もするし、三点かな。</review>

The three barbers here are top notch. You can walk-in or make an appointment. They offer fades to scissor cuts, so no matter the style they will hook you up!< /Text>

Been going to Tony for haircuts for over 3 years now and I can honestly say that his skills are unmatched by his competitors in the area. I am always satisfied with my haircut and am impressed that the quality of it is still great. He knows what's he's doing.

He always got AM 1430 playing too haha<//Text>

<review>I've been coming here for my haircuts for the past four years. Tony is fast and skillful with his haircuts. He is also very good to have a conversation with while getting you a haircut. I recommend anyone to come get their haircut here.< /review>< user>

Love to come here for my haircuts and my husband's, the barber is very skilled, show him a picture of front and back of a hairstyle cut once, twice at most and he'll do a fantastic job. That's why I'm a regular. 🌷🌻<//text>

I am stuck on this place. I only see one man working -the owner- and he is always very quick and efficient. I had 3 people ahead of me yesterday and was in and out of there in 30 minutes! Mind you, I always get my hair layered.<//review>

Initially, I was suspicious of her. Now I have to say she is one of the best. Plus, she is so pretty. Every time I go out of the shop, I feel myself glowing. Highly recommend it.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2c55dd7e3f58f:0xfa2b174b5c4a920c< /gmapID>< time>

<Date>1529904088375<//Date><rate>5</rate><text>Tony does a great job at cutting men’s hair styles. I get the same type of haircut every time, so I can’t say if he is able to vary from the standard Asian male style. Reasonably priced, but parking can be tricky at busy times because of the nearby Chinese restaurant. Trying to catch him near opening when he’s fresh and there’s no line, because the quality of the hair cut declines when he’s rushed or tired (understandably).< /text>< Pics>

<text>Immensely grateful to all the staff of this office especially to Dr Fields whom I have been seeing for all my cosmetic dentistry needs for so long. His perfection is beyond comparable. It does not come cheap but definitely worth every dollar. His expertise will fulfill your million dollar smile.  Extremely grateful for the outcome. Thank you Peninsula Cosmetic Dentistry.< /text>< Name>

Wow! This was truly such an exceptional experience. I was coming off of a poorly done set of veneers (different dentist/office/state) and was very nervous about going through the process again. The team made me feel comfortable, heard, and empowered to make a decision about the right next steps for me. They’ve also gone above and beyond in helping me with all of the logistics associated with the process. AND the final result is INCREDIBLE - my new teeth look amazing.</review>

All of the dental hygienists do the best job here. Stephanie and Mary and I can’t seem to remember all of their names, but they all do an amazing cleaning, it’s painless, quick and efficient.
It’s a way better deep cleaning than any other place I have been to.
I also feel comfortable here because they are all so professional, caring, informative,  and adhere to standards of care. Highly recommend Dr Karl as well.<//review>

Very professional, accommodated me immediately and with understanding for my unique circumstances. Dr Karl fixed a filling which was previously done incorrectly the same day - they printed porcelain inlay right there in the office, no temporary fillings.
He answered all my questions and made me very comfortable during the procedure.
Great service, highly recommend.<//text>

Have to admit, I was not looking forward to excavating 3 fillings, replace one filling, then do 2 crowns. One plus with this place is they have a computerized milling machine onsite, so no temp needed. Then Dr. Karl hits the perfect balance of explaining what he’s about to do but not being too chatty. His work was flawless, he fits in well with the crew here, which is very professional and the pinnacle of competence.<//Text>

I moved to the Bay Area 7 years ago and my wife and I have been Patients of Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry with Dr. Field for 6 years now.

I found Dr. Field after doing extensive research to find the best of the best cosmetic dentists and Dr. Field came highly recommended.

Due to an accident I had as a child, I needed to get 3 dental implants and a crown on my 4 front teeth. I just got the last implant done 3 days ago.  Thanks to Dr. Field my smile now looks amazing!

All the staff of Peninsula Center are super nice and very accommodating.  My wife and I also get our teeth cleanings done here too.  The processes they have put in place to assure the safety during this horrible pandemic makes use feel super comfortable when getting worked on.

I highly recommend Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry!<//text>

After decades of terrible and sometimes barbaric dental work I finally found Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry and I couldn't be happier. I'm 72 years old and have a great smile for the first time!

I am very anxious about dental work and Dr. Field was able to give me sedation when I needed it. They are so gentle that even the injections are not painful. They make sure you are comfortable and that you are happy with the outcome of your treatment there.

I highly recommend this great place. The consultation is free of charge, so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.

Happy New Year!< /review>

<review>I had broken a tooth that needed repair and a crown. My former dentist required two visits to get this done. Here,  because of the investment of top technology, and skill, Dr. Karl Supal was able to build the crown right there. One visit, two hours, on time, done. Done? Wow.

Dr. Karl Supal is not only smart and knowledgeable, his passion for being forward thinking, commitment to excellence, and  great bed-side manner,  makes him my dentist of choice.

Angie, who has been with the practice 30 years, has the personality and expertise to put anyone at ease. They make a great team.

I don't dread going to the dentist anymore!<//review>< pics>

<Review>I had an amazing experience at Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry. I got a porcelain veneer done with Dr. Shile. Because of COVID I had a virtual consultation first, then a records appointment, cleaning, zoom whitening (was optional but recommended), temporary veneer (2 weeks), and then finally the permanent veneer.  I had lots of appointments and every time I was impressed by the cleanliness and how nice the staff was. Scheduling was easy, and I appreciated the text reminders. Dr. Shile did an amazing job with the veneer and I appreciated how she talked me through each process. She was very gentle and I never felt any pain. Karina was amazing with communicating, scheduling appointments, and any other questions I had. I was scared about coming to the dentist during COVID, but after my first appointment I was put at ease. They are very well equipped and use all the personal protective equipment to make it as safe as possible. Peninsula Center is great and I highly recommend it. My whole family raves about this place, it is great!<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>I have been a customer of PCCD ever since it took over the practice of my original dentist, Dr. Black. I've been very satisfied over the years, but I wanted to write about my experience during the pandemic.

I was worried at first about entering an enclosed space for a long time. But Dr. Field and his staff have taken extra precautions to make it safe, including screening all patients entering, increasing the air circulation, running air filters in every room, and wearing protective equipment such as additional protective clothing, additional face masks and head masks, face shields, and gloves.

I first returned to the office in June for a scheduled cleaning. I've been dealing with resorption of several teeth over the years, and before the pandemic started Dr. Field and I had discussed replacing a bridge because another tooth next to it was dying. Once I saw how safe it was in the offices, I had surgery in June to remove my failing teeth and put in implants to hold the new bridge. Then over the next four months, Dr. Field and his team worked to make sure the bone grew around my implants, to electronically scan my teeth for both the final bridge and a temporary 'false bridge' (for the few times I might need to show my face on Zoom! :) ), to monitor my progress, and finally this week to place the bridge. It looks great! Through it all the Dr. and his staff were helpful, always explained procedures, and made sure I didn't feel any discomfort. And they kept me (and their other patients) safe from COVID-19.

I recommend Dr. Field and the whole staff at PCCD. Thank you making my smile whole, even during this trying time!<//text>< Pictures>

<text>I have been a patient of PCCD for over 10 years.  The quality of care is unrivaled in my opinion.
Dr Field and Dr Shile are exemplary in their respective fields.  I have had Invisaligns, numerous crowns replaced and a dental implant with in office sedation.  Dr Field and Dr. Shile are skillful and compassionate doctors. PCCD has the latest technology available and make every procedure as comfortable and pain free as possible.  The hygienists are great and help me to keep my dental health on track.  The office staff is wonderful and so helpful with appointments, etc.
I cannot imagine going to another dental practice for care.  I have recently moved to Tracy Hills, CA and gladly drive the hour or so to see my dentists and hygienists.</text>< pics>

They gave me state of the art professional advise for all of my troubled areas and the repair work and replacement to my much needed areas was just perfect! My Hygienist Kathy is simply the best! She is very caring and experienced! The Staff are very courteous and knowledgeable as well! Most of my family are also patients there now and are very happy! 😀</text>

I had an extremely positive experience at Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry! Dr. Karl began with a video appointment to talk with me about my concerns and let me know how he thought he could help. During the in person appointment, the front desk staff were lovely and the dental hygienist was friendly,  respectful, and professional. Dr. Karl was equally so. He took his time to describe his assessment of my dental health and the next steps for treatment. We went ahead with some fillings and he did a meticulous job of matching the color of my tooth and making sure that everything was smooth and finished correctly. I am thrilled with the results! I will definitely go back!< /Text>

I had an amazing experience from start to finish with everyone at PCCD! I’ve been thinking of getting my smile makeover for several years and have consulted with several cosmetic dentists, but I’m so glad I finally decided on PCCD. I had my final installation of my 20 veneers yesterday 8/31/20 and absolutely LOVE the outcome. I was pretty particular with what I wanted and Dr Fields and team went above and beyond to give me even more than I expected with my final outcome for my smile makeover! Would recommend them to anyone that wants the best of the best! Their cost is definitely worth the results!</Review>

Look no further. This is THE place for top notch expert dental procedures with state of the art/high tech equipment/diagnostics, where I received beautiful veneers (they changed my life), thorough cleanings (Stephanie is a fantastic!), multiple crowns (Dr. Shile, thank you for your expertise and kindness!) and retainers/night guards as well as procedure prep/assistance (Angie, YOU are a ROCKSTAR for so many reasons- including your decades of experience and positive spirit). The uber-friendly front office/accounting staff and spa-like surroundings (complete with fresh orchids and grapefruit scented hand lotion) complete the commendable experience!</text>

<review>I recently had my first-ever tooth extraction and decided to proceed with an implant.  The tooth was fairly damaged and the extraction wasn’t a piece of cake but Dr. Field performed his usual stellar job!  I chose conscious sedation for both the extraction and the implant placement and had NO discomfort and an easy recovery.  The final step, the crown, was completed this week and I couldn’t be happier.  Dr. Field allayed all my fears and his expertise, and super competent staff, made the process a breeze.  He’s a true rock star!</review><user_name>Linda McLaughlin</user_name>< user_id>

<Text>Why I continue to go to The Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry since 2004 as my primary dental care is the consistency in services. In addition, the exceptional office team.  Janna is a familiar face who always welcomes me even when she is not helping me.  Anggie (Dental Assistant) has been there since day one with the skill sets that make me smile when I see her come for me.  I don’t hesitate to go to my 6-month cleanings with Cathy due to her skills.
I must admit I was worried when Dr. Hartley retired but Dr. Field has made the transition seamless on top of his stellar skills in dentistry.</Text>< user_name>

I’ve been going to Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry for several years. The dentists, hygienists (especially Stephanie) and staff are always friendly and professional. The office is relaxing and modern. I was a little worried about going to the dentist while pregnant and with the covid pandemic still going on. Those worries didn’t last long as they went above and beyond with their safety protocols. I felt comfortable being in the office during my exam knowing that they were doing everything they could to keep their patients safe and healthy. I would recommend this office to everyone.<//Review>

<review>I am a difficult dentistry patient as I gag when I have one of their tools in my mouth. Dr. Field’s ability to sedate/use mild anesthesia was the solution to my challenge and he did a great job. He also put me through three sets of Invisalign until one last stubborn tooth was perfectly in the right place, without additional charges. I highly recommend Dr. Field...<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1598652806736, 'text': 'Thank you Jordi!'}</Resp>< GmapID>

I absolutely love coming to Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry for all of my dental needs. I used to be very anxious about going to the dentist especially for cleanings but at PCCD I have never felt that. My hygienist, Mary has always provided me with so much comfort and is always so gentle and attentive to me during my cleanings. She is INCREDIBLE and I love working with her! I highly recommend Dr Field and his team for any of your cosmetic dental needs. Thank you PCCD Team for always making me feel so comfortable and like family.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Name>Bernadette Mudd< /Name><user_id>116520287595848755084</user_id><review>There is no way I could adequately articulate how Dr. Field has changed my life. It’s just a smile, right? Let me start by saying how terrified I was of going to the dentist. After years of treatment by an uncle who I’m sure meant well but should have stopped being a dentist well before I came along, followed by others who I’m sure also had good intentions but who dismissed my fears and never took the time to fully understand my mouth, my teeth, my overall health and more importantly how one impacted the other, I gave up. I was tired of going to a dentist only to be berated about how I didn’t brush or floss enough or any number of other things when, I was. I was tired of getting dental procedures from providers who gave little thought to my fear and comfort or why I seemed to have so many issues. It got to the point where I could not even sit in the dentist chair without physically shaking – honestly, it’s a wonder I did not loosen the chair from the floor. However, when you suddenly realize that your daughter’s wedding is 3 months away and research is smacking you in the face with how much the health of your mouth/teeth impacts your overall health – cardiovascular, dementia, cancer….you realize you need to do something.

Covid made everything more complicated of course but I set off to find someone who could help me. I did numerous “virtual” appointments with several provides who all had raving reviews and advertised “painless” dentistry. I knew it would take a lot for me to trust and feel comfortable with anyone. Many of those I spoke with were pleasant but I still felt like they were passing judgement – I didn’t need anyone to tell me how bad my teeth were or how ghastly they looked – believe me I was more than aware. I had been dealing with my mouth for years and made a point to not smile with an open mouth when I sat in board meetings, interviewed clients, or even socialized. Then I met Dr. Field and that was the start of relationship that has profoundly changed my world.

From day 1, Dr. Field has been thorough, thoughtful, and compassionate. He has listened to me, heard me, and addressed all my concerns and my fears. He has given me a complete smile makeover and at times, it has been scary but he has always acknowledged my fears and made sure that any pain I was experiencing was addressed – this is huge for me. I have a fairly high pain tolerance, but we all have our limits and research has shown that you heal faster when pain is addressed, and you are able to sleep. I am so thankful that I found Dr. Field and I still become a bit emotional when I think about how much he has improved my quality of life, how others respond to my new smile, how I no longer shy away from the camera, how much better I feel about myself and the comfort that I get knowing that my overall health is being addressed.

I would be remiss if I did not also acknowledge the staff at PCCD. Mary Darlene, Amanda, Nancy, and everyone at PCCD that I have interacted with have all been thoughtful, considerate, and professional.

I’m not yet to the point where I get excited about going to his practice, but I no longer dread my appointments either…. that is called progress.<//review><response>{'time': 1606925309917, 'text': 'Thank you Bernadette!

I have always loved going to PCCD and it is just as amazing now during the COVID pandemic. The office staff is kind and helpful and the procedure for entering and exiting is clear and well explained. And WOW! The cleaning and safety protocols! So amazing! This office uses every cleaning and safety precaution I have ever heard of... and a few that I never knew existed. I was not concerned about my health or safety for a single moment and had a very relaxing and enjoyable appointment.< /Text>

<Review>I have been a patient of peninsula cosmetic dentistry for about 18 years. Despite having moved several times, I still make it a point to travel the distance to Los Altos as their service, professionalism, friendly environment, AND detail to excellence is surpassed by none! I will continue traveling the distance (now in Almaden Valley) to Peninsula Cosmetic Dentistry in Los Altos as they have always made me feel valued and as a part of their family!!!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>My experience from start to finish was nothing short of spectacular. The office catered to my every need, was very responsive, examined my mouth more thoroughly than any dentist ever had before, and I was never in doubt or pain throughout the entire process. Even with COVID cleaning restrictions, they were ready for me every time I arrived and went through the protocols with the utmost efficiency. I had to get the crowns on my two front teeth replaced and the color matching and shaping is FLAWLESS. Even for the temporaries they spent time to make them look as good as they possibly could. Then, when my permanent teeth came in, I was astounded at the quality of appearance. Throughout the process, Dr. Shile offered suggestions and comments about my teeth but was never forceful, and I never felt pressured to do anything. She did a great job of informing me of all my options and helping me to make the decision that was right for me. Overall, I would recommend this office ten times out of ten. My experience could not have been better.<//Text><resp>{'time': 1597290283500, 'text': 'Thank you so much for sharing your experience Jesse!'}<//resp>< Date>

<text>Since 2013 I have received excellent care at PCCD.  I am somewhat of a perfectionist when it comes to teeth and know how hard it is to find a top notch cosmetic dentist. I am recommending Dr. Marlana Shile because in addition to being a genuinely kind human being, she provided meticulous dentistry.  I would recommend her with 100+ stars.< /text>< Pics>

I have been going to the PENINSULA CENTER OF COSMETIC DENTISTRY for more than 12 years for all of my dental needs which has included Crowns, Onlays, regular hygiene, Zoom whitening and Invisalign.  I love Dr. Field.  He is a superb dentist performing all aspects of cosmetic dentistry, dental implants and IV sedation. He is very friendly and sincerely wants you to be pleased with his staff and the quality of his work.  The staff is tremendous-- Janna et al up front, Angie and Brooke as dental assistants and Katy, my hygienist for the entire time I have been going to the office.

Covid precautions are taken very seriously  and I always feel completely safe when I am there.
I have had a crown and an onlay within the past month and I was never concerned for my health of the health of the staff.
This is a great dental office and it comes with my highest recommendation!

<Date>1550192869556< /Date><review>I decided to get veneers for the front, upper four teeth. Dr. Field completely changed my smile and confidence for the absolute better. He recommended teeth whitening, and walked me through the entire process each step of the way. Each time I had an appointment, he made me feel confident that he was listening to my concerns and in the fate of my teeth! I am typically quite anxious when it comes to dental work, but I never once felt uncomfortable. Dr. Field's team is also incredible, and never felt I was in incompetent hands. He is professional, caring, and extremely good at what he does. I would trust Dr. Field with any one of my family members or friends.< /review>< Name>

Being in the "high risk" group, we were very concerned about venturing out for medical and dental services.  Dr. Field's staff was wonderful in contacting us early on to re-schedule appointments that had to be canceled during the initial shutdown. We know how important dental care is to our overall health, so as the weeks went on, we knew we had to come in asap when they could once again see us.

Finally, we had appointments. I had been having concerns about two teeth;  one had just had a full crown pop off three days prior.  So I carefully gathered the things I needed to bring with me and prepared for my second venture out of the house since March.  I was nervous and had not yet adjusted to the precautions one now takes when going anywhere, including a grocery store visit I'd planned to make after my appointment, so I was feeling a bit frazzled.

Long story short, I sat down in the chair, relieved and comforted by the comprehensive safety procedures in place and how closely they were being followed. I reached into my bag for the container with the crown that had come off, only to find out it wasn't there!  I was literally shaking, wondering where I'd left it; had it fallen out as I rushed to get ready?  Anggie calmly had me get up to check my car (not there, so had to be at home), then she and Dr. Karl looked at the schedule and discussed how they could somehow fit me in that same day so I could come back with the crown, rather than wait at least a day for a new appointment.  I was so grateful and impressed that they would do this, knowing how tightly booked their schedule is.  I was back about an hour later and Dr. Karl got the crown successfully back in place.  What a relief!  I appreciated that he talked about what he was doing and why, as Dr. Field always does.

I had also broken my upper retainer, so as Anggie took the mold for a new one I had a few minutes to talk with her, and I learned just how seriously everyone in the office takes the COVID-19 precautions.  I mentioned how uncomfortable it must be to have the N95 mask on while working and talking with patients, and she told me that they put the gear on before they come into the office and only take it off when they are outside the office for a break.  I had noted to myself that everyone had the PPE on, even someone sitting in their office, where you might expect to see them take if off for a 'breather'.  The protocols for both patients and staff seemed impressively strict and thorough, yet, as always, the staff was 100% positive and helpful.  What had started out as a very stressful day, ended on such a positive note.  And I was so relieved to know that I did not have to worry about my husband coming in for his appointment the following week.

We've been patients of Peninsula Center for Cosmetic Dentistry for quite a few years - starting when I consulted Dr. Hartley about problems with my teeth, and not feeling comfortable with my dentist's continued patching of the problems, but not recognizing or fixing the underlying issue.  They have always gone 'above and beyond' in providing amazing care, even in unusual circumstances (being in a remote location with a dental emergency).

Long-winded review, but posting in the event it can help someone else having similar concerns, looking for an exceptional dental practice.</review>

I really enjoyed my experience with Dr. Supal who replaced a crown and did several fillings on my lower front teeth due to erosion from brushing.  He and all the staff at PCCD are extremely friendly, gentle and caring,  The office uses state of the art equipment and procedures as well as being very careful due to the covid pandemic. At the age of 69 I also had Dr Field improve my bite using Invisalign. Currently at least nine of my family members go to PCCD for their dental needs and love the experience. Did I mention the doctors are handsome too?</Text>

I've had some cosmetic work done by Dr. Hartley. He does exceptional work. When doing cosmetic dentistry, there is true artistry in envisioning what the new tooth should look like. The shape, color, size, position all factor into the end result. Not only is Dr. Hartley and amazing artist in that regard, he has the well-honed skills and competence to deliver spectacularly.

Unfortunately due to my old dentist's ineptness, I also needed an implant. Thankfully, Dr. Field here is a master. He patiently explained the entire process, what he was doing and why. Everything went flawlessly.

Dr. McFarlane has been handling my dental maintenance, including a fabulously transparent job on a chipped tooth. Perfect color blending.

The cleaning staff is top notch. Unlike my old place, you won't find any dental interns learning on the job with your teeth. They actually make your time there like a day at the spa - with a warm, lavender neck pillow and dipping your hands in hot paraffin wax.

If you're seeking help for your dental issues, I highly recommend you check this place out. You're welcome!< /review>

For the past 10 years+ I have trusted my smile to  the staff at PCOCD.

Dr Hartley and Dr Fields strive to deliver the highest quality dental experience often sharing leading edge technology and procedures.

The staff is always helpful, welcoming and professional.

The office is clean and very welcoming.  I especially enjoy the TV screens with cable which is a good distraction from the work being performed.

I am not a fan of dental work – necessary evil- but I am always reassured and well informed.

My kids age 8 and 6 look forward to visiting the office for their dental check up and cleaning with Kathy twice a year.

The Dr’s and the Staff go the extra mile with weekend procedures (yes I have been there!) and follow up calls post visits.

I have complete faith that my family and I are with the best!<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Have been a patient of Dr. Hartley and his colleagues for 8 years.  Visits to Peninsula Center for Cosmetic Dentistry consistently run smoothly - from a modern and ultra-clean facility, on-time appointments, individual attention from hygienist, dentist, consultation, billing or scheduling staff, everything is easy!  In addition, having full-service cosmetic dentistry combined with more traditional dental cleaning and procedures makes this one-stop shopping for all my dental needs.  Highest standards of dental procedures.<//review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>I recently went to Dr. Hartley for some cosmetic dental work.  He, (and everyone in his office), was absolutely top notch.  You not only get Dr. Hartley's expertise in the field, but you get the care and customer service that you just don't get elsewhere.  They really go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.  I am so happy with the work that he did and I'm so glad I did not trust my smile to anyone else!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>As a new patient, my visits have changed how I look at going to the dentist. From the moment I walked into the office I was impressed the the top-notch service.

The anxiety that I normally feel when being in a dental office quickly melted away as I worked with Dr. Field and his staff.

Everything I needed or wanted to know was explained to me. Dr. Field prepared me at each step, always making sure that I was confortable and ready.

I was also amazed at how I didn't need to have a temporary crown because they had all of the equipment to quickly create what they needed using impressive technology. It was fast, painless, and left me with a very high level of confidence that they were putting my needs ahead of anything else.

I never thought I would say this, but I am actually looking forward to my next appointment.

Thanks Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry!<//Review>< Pics>

Dr. Field is so patient and gentle that even a long procedure is downright pleasant!  I'm all for pain-free dentistry, and Dr. Field is the master.  Everyone in my family has been his patient for more than ten years, and we all highly recommend Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry.<//text>

I had an awesome experience beginning to end with Peninsula Center for Cosmetic Dentistry.
I came in for an Invisalign consultation after my results with a previous orthodontist (braces) did not finish as planned and my experience with them was not great. I ended up going with Invisalign treatment with Dr. Field who was amazing, thorough, and very detail-oriented which I appreciated. He went over everything in detail, listened to every request, and the results were exactly what I asked and hoped for. They even do minor tooth shaping where needed, polishing, and whitening treatment when finishing up!. The entire staff and team are wonderful – the assistants are just amazing, friendly ladies who are very skilled and always make you feel relaxed and comfortable. The entire front desk staff are great, friendly ladies as well, always helpful and welcoming for every visit. I was so happy with the entire treatment plan and results from them, all of the equipment and methods are top of the line, new and advanced, the staff is incredible, the pricing, etc extremely fair, and the results were exactly what I asked for. I would highly recommend them  to anyone seeking orthodontic (or dental) treatment! You will not be disappointed.<//Text>

<text>Incredible experience I would be glad to paste pictures of my smile after 26 weeks of Invisalign treatment. I wore braces quite late but never get to the perfection and the only souvenir l had was a painful long process. Invisalign is easier to care, painless and really difficult to be noticed. I have never experienced such a professional and carrying service, helpful and never trying to oversell their services. As a client you feel respected,  cared of,
you are given options and you make your final decision without any pressure. They are open to any discussion understand clients concerns. Exceptional service, recommend by a friend and l will continue  recommendations.< /text></record>

<date>1396291287339< /date><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry is Great! - I recently had an appointment with Dr Joseph Field, and was very impressed with the office staff as well as Dr Field's level of professionalism.  My appointment was for Invisalign and Dr Field was able to have a very open conversation regarding the short and long term benefits of the program.  After the decision was made to go the Invisalign route - Dr Field used his hi-end equipment to photograph the teeth instead of using a gross molding clay to generate the impressions of the teeth in question which took no more than 15 minutes.  2 weeks later all the trays arrived and the program has been going great ever since (I am in month 3 and already seeing significant movement!) - Very happy with experience

Overall - I was the staff was great, Dr Field provides a great experience for patients and is passionate about his work.  I would absolutely recommend Peninsula Center of Cosmetic Dentistry and Dr Field to anyone and everyone.

Thanks Dr Field!<//review>< Pics>

Big Trucks...Avoid arriving at location via Black Rd from 5-7am. Extreme non-stop heavy traffic crossing over W. Main St (CA-166) into entrance.  Also, should you pass the entrance, continue west on Main St and turn RIGHT at Signal Light onto Bonita School Rd. Make an easy U-Turn at Frontier Cooling on the RIGHT. Yep, speaking from experience.

The scale on-site for field trucks only. The closest Public Scale is at Frontier Cooling. The Chevron Truck Stop has a scale as well.</review>

Thought to myself that I should enjoy a spa and decided that this was a great place to choose. I was not disappointed. This place was wonderful.

The environment was really relaxing. The service was amazing. Everyone was nice.

Storage available to put your stuff. Showers available to wash off after.

There was a parking lot across the street that was supposed to accommodate the time spent at the spa, but the time limit seemed to pass by really quick, so expect to pay for parking.

Only downside is the place is very pricey. Hard pressed to keep coming unless I became filthy rich.< /Review>

<Review>Most impressive spa experience ever!  From the moment you walk in until the moment you exit, you are treated like royalty.  The staff and treatment is exceptional.  Best massage I’ve ever had.  Parking sucks but WHO CARES.  I will be back.  Worth every penny :)</Review>< Pictures>

Just an amazing experience! I did the Traditional Thai Massage and the Extreme Remedy and both were amazing! Have never had a massage quite like that and walked out feeling great. Will definitely be back.</Review>

< Review>
My review is for the infrared sauna; I have not yet had a massage at Raven Spa. I do weekly sessions in the sauna and love how easy it is for me to book these. The sauna is always prepped for me and set to my temperature preferences. Milan is an absolute gem -- she is always so warm, professional, and helpful.<//Review>

<date>1555989265177<//date><rate>5</rate><Review>The Staff is amazing, everyone is so kind and accommodating! We went in for the Japanese experience which was a couples massage and a bath soak and we were served sushi, it was a relaxing and pampering experience. Before the massage they served us tea as we filled out treatment questions like what areas to focus on and pressure. They reviewed it with us before we go into the room and they had noticed it was my boyfriend's birthday and they wished him happy birthday. The masseuse later also wished him and thanked him for coming in on his birthday which seems like such an insignificant thing but I thought that was nice.< /Review>< Pictures>

Nice time off during my short visit in Beverly Hills. Very pleasant moment and the massage is good not the best one but good enough. We mostly go there for the environment. The staff is very caring and the manager have given me tips for my trips and where to get Japanese treats around which was nice of her ;)<//review>

Came here with my wife with a certificate and the couples massage and hot rock treatment was amazing. Soooo relaxing, doesn't feel rushed at all. We left there feeling 10 years younger and can't wait to come back!</Review>

By far the BEST spa experience I’ve had yet!

From the moment I walked in, I felt at peace and was so relaxed from the therapeutic  aroma, and beautiful serene music. Everyone was SO welcoming and friendly… and the Japanese tea and chocolates were such a nice treat!

My therapist was AMAZING! She knew exactly what I needed, and I didn’t even have to explain! Best deep tissue massage ever!!!

After my massage, I was escorted to the private lounge where I nearly melted into the sofa… and was served even more delicious Japanese sweets!

Can't wait to be spoiled again soon! :)< /review>

<text>Tomoko Spa experience was mind blowing. A relaxing paradise in the mid of Beverly Hills. From the moment you walk in to very end of  your treatment, Tomoko staff are able to excel the highest expectation someone can possibly have. A level of spa that I have never seen before in California!! A must go!!<//text>< pictures>

A top 10 spa experience with much in the way of luxury and pampering. Considering the cost of a private room for 3 hours, couples massage for 60 min, foot bath, spa amenities, quality refreshments, top notch sushi and professional staff, the price was right on par, but where else could you find all of this in one place?  A perfect anniversary gift for both of us!   Dōmo arigatō Tomoko< /text>

By most people's ratings, 4.5 stars is amazing. But in this case would be an insult.
Every detail in this spa was catered to and executed with absolute consciousness & conviction.
From the moment I stepped into the main door, being greeted by a warm smile while simultaneously experiencing an injection of soothing fragrances and soft traditional music i was sold.
And then being taken back through the double doors was something i did not expect. An extremely clean, long, beautiful, minimalistic and traditional dimly lit hallway.
I was sat down in the lounge, my shoes removed and seated into an incredibly comfortable couch. An attendant served traditional green tea, Iced tea, iced water, and a chilled jell-o like dessert. The experience of relaxation had begun long before entering the actual massage room.
I was then introduced to Piku (sorry if i misspelled it), a lovely lady who's skills are beyond measure and had me feeling like royalty. I have to be honest that my expectation was already set really high the moment I walked into the spa. But it was perfectly matched with the pleasant and carefully selected therapist.
For those that may find the price a little above average, just remember this place and service IS above average. You actually get MORE than what you could expect. It's a complete experience. One that I will often frequent when in the Los Angeles area.
Treat yourself RIGHT; reward yourself to something real instead of guessing what kind of therapist or experience you will get. Can't wait for my upcoming session.
Domo arigato Team Tomoko!

Overpriced over hyped fake reviews and if you happen to call in advance to cancel your appointment  To bed for you your card is going to be charged the full session which is $300</review>

Hate the drive thru.... Everytime I go and get only 1-2 items they always ask me to park and they will bring out the food.... And no one was behind me ... Then they get my order wrong and I have to go back in....It doesn't make sense. Worst del taco</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I ordered a large asada nachos and the girl, who I'm assuming is named Heather, was rude over the intercom and rude at the window. Conveniently the store didnt have asada but when I asked for a refund on the nachos, after being offered chicken, didn't even attempt to process my refund but instead started to talk to someone in the back kitchen area. This girl was planning on changing my asada I paid more for into chicken and not give the difference in pricing back to me. It seems to me the staff just didn't want to prepare the asada until I said i wanted a refund. Then they proceeded to throw tons of jalapenos in the nachos. I'm EXTREMELY dissapointed.<//Review>< Pictures>

Have been going here for years and can say after dozens of visits that this location has below-average service, general cleanliness/appeal, and food quality/accuracy than most Del Taco locations. I would recommend going to the one further up the road along Van Buren. I keep trying this place again to give them more chances but they disappoint too frequently with the food and service. Just today they gave me the skimpiest taco I've literally ever seen. And yes I know they're not supposed to be super stacked but I've gotten probably hundreds of tacos by now from Del Taco and this location holds back.</review>

Got asked to pull forward when all I ordered was a double del combo with deluxe chili fries, I was asked to pull forward when no one was in front of me, wasn’t given a receipt, waited forever I get home, my cup was filled with ice to the brim, I had like three sips of soda, chili fries were made with cold stale fries, there was almost no cheese on my fries, I asked for extra sauce got a dry burger with tomato end slices no bigger than a fifty cent piece. All in all the worst Del Taco experience I have ever had. I want my ten dollars back.<//review>

Horrible customer service for delivery. I tried to order 3 separate times from the same restaurant and completely idffetent times and still the employeees give the drive and myself a hard time. They say they can’t fine my order or the driver is at the wrong store - maybe hoping to turn a profit off the delivery app. Either way, they deserve to be shut down. It’s ridiculous how they’re taking advantage of the elderly, it’s despicable<//Text>

Yummy food.  Generous portions, clean, friendly, $1.00 for fresh made tea.  Great for the entire family or seniors on a budget.<//Review>

<text>Attracted in this afternoon from large sign set out front stating Del Tacos all this week 3 for $3.49 went in and ordered those plus other things and was charged full menu price. When I contested the price they said that expired last week and they would not honor there advertisement. False advertising, I asked for my money back and went next door to Bakers. I will never use that location again and I will pass around the news to everyone I know.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

This restaurant needs remodeling.  I don't think it's changed since the 80's when it was Naugles.  The grill need cleaning, and we ordered breakfast burrito combos that were so small they should have been in the $1.00 menu.  The staff was nice and friendly.<//review>

<text>They were super slow. Gave us a burrito with guacamole in it even though we specifically ordered it without. My daughter is very allergic, and broke out in hives. The fellow taking orders didn't seem to know that the Del Taco DOES come with onions. The two workers spent a great deal of time giggling and talking. Took over 5 minutes once we were at the window</text>< Pictures>

Food was way way to expensive for what I got. The burger, one patty was cold and one was kind of hot. Chili fries less than a teaspoon of chili. Very disappointing and will not go back 🙄< /Review>

<review>Why do they always ask me to pull up and park in the lot to wait even when there's no one in the drive thru? To cheat some customer service timer?

No white sauce on my tacos. There was no red sauce on my wife's red bean burrito, just bean and cheese. No receipt was given to me. Stale french fries.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Horrible. Management is a joke. Told to pull forward when I am the only customer. Left to wait 15 minutes for food. They told me they forgot. In the meantime there was no other customers. And they did not refund my money. I was given no food no refund. Calling corporate office.</Review>< gmap_id>

<text>Absolutely horrible. Knock it down and start over. Service is horrendous. They mess up your order every time. Sloppy food when you get it. Usually cold. You'll wait for at least 10-15 min. In line. I never see the same employees from one visit to next. I'm done eating here.< /text>< Name>

< Review>
I was in the drive through for 10 minutes before someone finally got on the mic to take my order. When they finally greeted me they acted like children and kept repeating that they couldn't hear me. But they kept answering everything I was saying. I'll never go to this Del Taco again. It turns out that the individual, Jacob, is one of the managers there. He was the one on the microphone acting like a child and pretending that he couldn't hear me. Worst Del Taco experience.<//Review>

<Review>I'm a former U.S. Army Ranger.  A little birdie just told me that he saw with his own eyes the management directing their employees to pull food back out of the trash!

Food an inspector made them throw out.

This is a warning to the public from me, Do not eat here.  Until they completely replace the management and re pass inspection.

Management did not get away with this in my city.  I'm not just a local guide.

Walk the line or do the time.< /Review><user_id>108789490336674171720</user_id>< response>

<text>Waited in the drive thru for 4 minutes precisely for my order to be taken, was the only person in the drive thru at 9am. Proceeded to the window to pay and was asked to pull forward and park with still no one else in the drive thru or inside, and waited 9 minutes for two burritos. Slow service and unnecessary movements.</text>< Pics>

That awkotaco moment when Del Taco runs out of SOFT TORTILLAS!!! It’s in the name people. del TACO!!! Seriously they only had ONE SOFT TORTILLA. The burritos were NASTY!! The beans were watery and gross. The cheese was sub par. But what really gets me is that DEL TACO only had O.N.E SOFT TACO!!! ONE!!! THEY ARE OPEN FOR 24 hours. What are they gunna do for the rest of the time? Overall disappointed and unsatisfied.<//Text>

Absolutely the worst establishment ever.  No breakfast ready at 1am when the sign clearly says 11pm to 11am.  The chicken burrito I ordered might as well been a cheese burrito because there was 3 bites of actual chicken and not to mention it was tiny!  Fries were stale and cold, and my small soda was full ice and less soda.  Screw this place and shame on me to even try this place again after months of not eating here.<//text>

<Date>1566347304801</Date><text>This is the worst Del Taco on the planet! I have lived in the area and frequented this Del Taco for many years and I have learned, through experience, to go into the store rather than drive through because they always make a mistake! In fact I have never been to this Del Taco and had my order prepared correctly. Today, I decided to take a chance and place an order through GrubHub but I should have known better! Of course they forgot part of my order... it's typical of this location! I have no idea why the corporate office hasn't stepped in and done something about it but I will certainly never go to this Del Taco again!< /text>< gmapID>

If breakfast is served from 11pm to 11am why at 4am do they tell you they have not had time to prep it. Or I love waiting in line for 15 min to have them come to the speaker and say sorry were closed for counting or some other stupid reason like we are waiting for the next shift to arrive and we are on overtime, like I care just do your job and make food!< /Review>

Employees are hit and miss here. It never fails they’ll get your order wrong or “forget” to put something in the bag after waiting 20+ mins in the drive thru line at dinner time.  Not all that consistent anymore with the food like they used to be. Seems as when they screw up your order on “accident” they happen to “forget” to give you the receipt too. It’s meh. Go next door to bakers.</Review>

< Review>
They never have breakfast past midnight when their sign clearly says 11 PM-11 AM. They use the same excuse every time, "our breakfast station isn't prepped yet." I used to work here, all they have to do pour their car of eggs on the grill and throw hash browns in the fryer.
This location has been pulling this BS for a few years now. SAD.
There's no way the General Manager here has not has this brought to their attention, so that must mean they are okay with it.</Review>

I have a bad experience every time I go here. Usually pretty slow and my order almost always gets messed up. Tonight I asked for a green burrito with no cheese and she read the order back correctly but when I received it I got a burrito with no sauce but lots of cheese. That will be my last time going there. I would not recommend.</text>

<Review>I like Del Taco but the one I recently visited was skimpy on the quantity of food in my order. The order of fries barely filled the container, the burritos were filled 3/4 with a lot of empty tortilla on the end.</Review>< pics>

This Del Taco is not good. I asked for a bean taco and they gave me a beef taco and I am a vegetarian. My sister asked for a bold burrito but they put no fries in it.<//text>

Not only were they the wrong items, but the food itself was awful compared to other Del Tacos. Random pieces of chicken in my beef taco. Burnt quesadilla. Burrito with a tiny scoop of beans and cheese, then wrapped over itself several times.
This particular location has gone way down hill.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dca51a2c2e1cc9:0x7b6ffbe7f9f34efe< /GmapID></record>

I ask for " a lot of mild sauce please" and receive 7 packets for my order of 6 tacos and a burrito. On top of that the order taker was rude and the service was slooooooow. I was watching them move slowly in the back with the drive through line backed up.

TLDR:  Avoid this del taco if you can make it to the one a mile down the road.

Edit: Came back to give them another shot. Stale taco shells, old fries, 9 sauce packets for 10 items when I asked for a lot, and the tacos weren't wrapped correctly so the contents of the tacos we're all over the bag. NEVER AGAIN.<//review>< Pics>

Staff was friendly.  It was 930am so I was the only one inside.  The beans were a bit bland. They were missing some salt. I do love del taco but I probably won't come back to this del taco because some of the items I ordered were missing some flavor.< /Review>
