After a slight kerfuffle with my to go order and speaking to the manager I decided against giving them a bad review. Got home... although not perfect as it was the original time I sat down and ate inside the restaurant... the food was still fabulous and the flourless chocolate cake is the best I have ever eaten. Can't wait to go back.<//review>

The food was so good i had to actually make a review. Ive never had Mediterranean food before but i started working at a different post office so I decided to try it out and they did not disappoint. The employees are really nice, a woman gave me some really good recommendations on what to try ;) Worth checking out.</text>

<Review>I really like this place. Good quality fresh food in a simple package. Better than most offering this type of food with one exception (why 4 stars instead of 5), they are inconsistent and, even worse, restrictive with substitutions. Even more so than other similar places. Specifically, not offering fries instead of rice or fried eggplant is an issue. It's not cheap, so don't be cheap with the customer. I suggest raising the price by $.20 and offer people what they want if it's that costly to provide the fries substitution. Just my thought.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1574113479676, 'text': 'Hello Jason, thank you for your review!

They should call this restaurant Same Same since it exemplifies what all Americans with bland and no cultural taste consider Mediterranean food. It no longer astonishes me when I read the reviews of people in Brentwood and the Westside of Los Angeles consider this food excellent. The food is fresh but this is not Mediterranean food. This is Mediterranean style food for the unsophisticated palate that is widespread on the Westside of Los Angeles. I am not a Shawarma eater any longer but I have had some amazing Shawarma in my lifetime and have traveled all over the Middle East and this is not Mediterranean food. This is the equivalent of New York like pizza or cheesecake but no where close to the real thing. I had Linner with my sister at "Same Same" last night and she confirmed what we knew from our two previous experiences at this restaurant. Fresh food with no real character and definitely not real Mediterranean food.< /text>

<Text>I ordered food and wanted additional sides. I added sides rice and falafel. I was charged $3.95 for rice and $1.95 for the falafel, in which the menu had a count of four.
I got my order and checked for correctness, but noticed that there were only 3 pieces of falafel instead of 4. When I asked about the quantity discrepancy their response was that they provide a reduced quantity because the pieces are bigger.

That doesn’t make sense - why not keep it the same size to match the quantity and price listed in the menu!?!<//Text></record>

Tom McClintock and his staff came through for me in a huge way to get a passport appointment on short notice when every passport agency in CA turned me away and said it was not possible. I am grateful for their urgency, care and execution.  They were happy to help.</review>

I have know the Congressman for many years and have met with him on many occasions to discuss issue of concern to the real estate community. While he may not always agree with our position, I believe he truthfully stands on what he believes, is articulate, and understands the issues.<//Review>

<review>I really appreciated reading your perspectives on how our governor is overstepping his authority.

We are following CDC and state guidelines.  We wear a mask when inside, shopping, and unable to keep distanced from others outside.  When we’re on a walk or hike...  masks are off and are unneeded since no others are in our proximity.

We walked into a Costco yesterday...  the store was jammed and had limited parking.  Everyone was wearing masks and trying their best to social distance - WHY ARE WE LIVING IN SUCH INCONSISTENT TIMES???

1st...  let’s follow the guidelines
2nd... let’s get our kids back to school-government officials need to hold school unions accountable!
3rd... let’s open back up our country
4th... AND respect the office of the president, senate and Congress, and quit the divide.  WAY TOO MANY NEGATIVE REVIEWS DON’T bring us together!</review></record>

Tom believes in freedom for all to earn what they can, and not in the tyranny of stealing from one to pay another.  Tyrants promise specifics that they can't deliver without stealing from someone else.  Beware of anyone making such promises.  You will likely end up their servant in the end.< /Review>

Terrible at math, doesn't understand basic science and doesn't seem to realize he lives in California.  He's too concerned with rural constituents that live in Iowa and the mid-west.  His vote for the tax overhaul helped strip millions in wealth from my community of high income, high taxed earners. The fact he doesn't even live in the district he represents ads to his detached voting record.  An embarrassment to public service and freeloads his paycheck delivering absolutely nothing to constituents.<//text>

< Review>
Rather than waiting for the results of the much needed (for fairness) FBI investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh by California resident Christine Blasey Ford, McClintock has rudely condemned her claim.  How does he know?  I live in his District and I can assure you that he has done nothing to protect our citizens or environment.  Just another self-serving professional politician.  He has done nothing to deserve another term in Congress.  Please join me and Vote Him Out!<//Review>

This guy votes against barring the executive branch from unilaterally withdrawing from NATO. That's an insane position to take. The economic and political fallout from the US even talking about withdrawing from NATO will be massive enough already without idiots like this making it worse< /text>

It’s disgusting to watch McClintock’s blinky eyed and deafening silence while trump systematically attacks the pillars of our American justice system, law enforcement, free press, military hero’s, and ultimately our American and world democracy... his ongoing non action are clear signs of tom’s own moral ineptitude, his mentally weak understanding of our country’s constitution, and his surrendering to authoritarian rule.

This can no longer be allowed.  From this day on... Tom and his zombie followers will never live another peaceful day until Tom makes two things happen.
1. Denounce trump entirely and unequivocally. Period
2. Write a letter to the speaker of the house demanding impeachment proceedings start immediately.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Can I give zero ...  after what McClintock said regarding Kavanaugh he does not represent me and my views. I reached out to his office to say that regardless of the outcome Kavanuaghs personality, Political views is not what is needed for the supreme court,  choose a different candidate. Not only did I not hear from his office but now his high regard for a man that doesn’t behave in the manner a supreme court justice should has deepened my reality that McClintock does not represent me!< /Text>

Dr. Siu & his team are the best dental team I’ve ever seen. Their equipment is top-notch, they’re really kind and personable too - especially Vidhi! They’ve made sure to make sure I’m fully educated on what will happen and make sure I feel comfortable throughout the process. I had to get my first ever filling today, and while I was nervous about the process they made it a really smooth and relatively painless process - it went much better than I expected! They encouraged me to bring headphones and play music the whole time too which I think made a huge difference too to not listen to the drill, and I appreciated the concern they showed to make sure the experience was as pleasant as possible under the circumstances. I would highly recommend SF dental arts to anyone who needs a new dentist!< /text>

As a new patient I had a great experience with Dr. Siu and the entire team today. Everyone takes pride in their work and patiently explains what they’re doing, goals for treatment, and works to educate you as the patient. I’m excited to get more work done with them as I know it will be the most up to date and quality treatment possible. Also a big fan of being able to select my own music :)</text>

< review>
After much research and reading reviews I decided to come to SF Dental Arts. First off I would like to say the ladies at the front desk are extremely nice and so friendly. They were so accommodating and so nice to my kids. Dr. Siu is extremely knowledgeable and told me what I needed to do for my next treatment. This was my daughters first time at a dentist, she was a little hesitant but because how friendly he is my daughter was able to warm up to him. I definitely recommend this place for new patients.</review>

Everyone here is so nice and kind!! I feel very welcomed overall and I'd say it feels very genuine instead of forced. The work on my teeth is always stellar, and I never leave there unsatisfied. The people at the front desk are a charm, they both are so nice and understand how to fulfill your needs exactly how you want it. The vibe is always nice since they play modern music in their office, and they even let patients request songs! Overall I'd say I'm always happy when I leave not just because of the dental work, but because of the personal care and attention I received. I'll be going here for as long as I can manage. I appreciate their diligence and care they put into the craft.< /review>

<Text>I have been a patient here for many, many years. Dr. Stanley Siu and his staff takes very good care of you. Every time I come in for my appointment everyone is so friendly, smiling and in a great mood. I always leave their office content. He walks you through everything he is doing in your mouth. Everyone is so genuine there. I trust them. I highly recommend making an appointment, you won’t regret it.</Text>< pictures>

<review>I’ve never been to a dental office that is very thorough and actually CARES about my teeth! I was confident from my very first visit because Dr. Siu and his staff explained to me everything that’s going on in my mouth and gave me a mini tour of my mouth by showing me pictures and demos on how to level up my oral health care. They even let you pick your favorite music! Although I live a couple of miles away it’s worth the travel to get the dental care that works for me the best!

Have had a great experience for both teeth cleaning and fillings. They do a far more thorough review of your bite and mouth than any other place I’ve been, they explain everything to you in detail, and I got the most thorough cleaning I’ve ever had. Fillings were as quick and painless as filling can be. All the staff are super nice and it feels like you get truly personalized service as opposed to just being shuffled in and out. Highly recommend them!</text>

Have always appreciated their care, attentiveness, and friendly approach - currently with Covid, they aren’t able to use all of their state of the art cleaning equipment, but they are open! I’ve also purchased Invisalign through them, and have had crowns replaced, etc. I would highly recommend them.</Review>

Not because I didn’t have insurance, not because I didn’t care about oral hygiene, I didn’t go because of the pain and discomfort I had become so used to from previous trips to the dentist. After a recommendation from a friend, I finally decided to give SF Dental Arts a chance. And boy am I glad I did! They provided me with many services that I wanted/needed but they were able to do it without a cringeworthy experience. It’s nice to feel the before/after difference without all the pain that it usually takes to get there. Not to mention Dr Siu and his staff were as friendly as they were professional. I have been recommending SF Dental Arts to everyone I know since.<//text>

I just had a restoration done by Dr. Cecilia that looks and feels great. Dr. Cecilia, Dr. Stanley, and all of the staff are friendly, extremely accommodating, and professional. Their work is exceptional and everyone in the office seems focused on comfort and making sure all of your questions are thoroughly answered.

I highly recommend this dental practice.< /text>

< Review>
My husband and I have been San Francisco Dental Arts' clients for a long time. I personally used to dread going to the dentist before I met Dr. Siu and his team. From the admin staff to assistants and dentists, every single person in this practice is very pleasant and professional. They are accommodating, helpful and quick. Going to the dentist should not be painful and I personally cant wait until my next visit.< /Review>

<Text>The team here is undeniably the best! We’ve been using this practice since 2016 and have never had a bad experience! From the front desk to the professional and experienced care we get in dental work, we highly recommend making an appointment. We get the best care and they are the most kind people in the city!
Moving to the city and having to find new doctors is challenging. Mark dentist off your list and call SF dental arts today! Tell them the Pilgreen family sent you!< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
Dr. Siu is amazing!  He sees all three of my kids and they love him.  The first time they went there, my eldest son said, "Mom, I really like Dr. Siu.  He is so nice and I'm glad we switched dentists."  We live in Concord and although SF is a little far to travel to see a dentist, it is totally worth it for us.  Dr. Siu's staff members are also very friendly and professional making every visit pleasant.  My family and I do not hesitate to recommend SF Dental Arts to others.  If you are looking for a new dentist/dental office look no further.< /Review>

Dr. Cecilia is very caring and does a great job keeping my oral hygiene on par.  The dental assistants and desk team members are on point and really complete the office.  My routine dental cleaning sessions have become more of a mediation time for me. Supplemental visits are always smooth sailing; the team is very organized and timely.
I’ve been coming to them for over 5 years and I’m always looking forward to my next visit.

<review>Dr. Cecilia and her staff are just so wonderful! She is gentle, trustworthy, compassionate, and thorough with her treatment. I will never go back to a corporate dentist office. She takes the time to explain everything, and answers any questions that you may have. Cleaning procedure at this office is about an hour, which is so nice because most dental offices try to do it in 30 minutes - which isn’t even a thorough cleaning. I’ve had my cleaning done here, and had 6 fillings done (I have terrible teeth!). Highly recommend!< /review><rating>5<//rating><Time>1570469668323< /Time>< Response>

Dr. Siu, Rehma, and Taylor are an all star team from start to finish. I'd have to say that Dr. Siu is one of the most meticulous and thorough dentists that I've ever visited. He provides a consultative approach and explains every detail of the procedure. I've gone through 3 different dentists in SF until I found Dental Arts.

He also uses a new technique developed in 2015 called BIOCLEAR for fillings. The fillings last longer and provide a more natural shape to your tooth.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

PS: I was skeptical about why I needed replacement fillings and he took the time to take pictures in the middle of the procedure to prove why I was wrong.<//review>

Dr. Siu office is one of the better dental offices I’ve been to. Staff is very friendly and quick to make sure that their patients needs are met. Sometimes they go out of their way to follow up after a procedure which makes you feel very valued as a patient.

Dr. Siu and Dr. Cecilia are very caring and make sure that you are comfortable at all times during a procedure. I’ve had multiple fillings done here and never had any issues or pain during or afterwards. I’ve also become very vigilant in taking better care of my teeth and leave every visit with positive results! Pro team, highly recommend!< /Review>

He communicates exceptionally well with his patients,  has never tried to convince me to have an unnecessary procedure and is open and honest in every respect, from the costs for any procedure to the expectation of discomfort, to the expected time involved, he shares information and decision making with patients.  Dr. Siu is competent, innovative and well respected among his peers.  I could not recommend him highly enough, and I'm fortunate to be among satisfied patients offering a review.</Review>< user_name>

First rate dental care. I've been coming to this practice since Dr. Kussman ran it. He was an awesome dentist: kind, caring, and gentle. When he retired and sold the practice to Dr. Siu, he told me that he wasn't ready to retire, but that he found someone who he believed could carry on in his style. He was right!<//review>

<review>the doctor and staff are nice, almost over friendly.   but I had bad experience with the billing. they fail to notify me they were out of my network and my dental insurance wouldn't cover.  I ended up paying most of the bill out of my pocket.  In those cases I would expect  business to burden the cost instead of asking individuals to do that.  They can easily absorb the cost as that's a matter of probability to their business as compare to individual patients who only do this a few times per year at most.  For managers who don't understand this, I feel a bad review would be fair.< /review><Name>Bouche Zhu< /Name>< Gmap_id>

Although it was my first time visiting,everyone in the office greeted me by my name. They understood exactly the discomfort i was experiencing and did an outstanding job attending my problem. Thanks to Dr. Sui i am now pain free and full of useful information to hopefully prevent the problem from occurring again.</text>< pics>

They have the highest quality meat and poultry and it's sold at a reasonable price. They also do an excellent job of managing space so that patrons are not crowded while in the shop. I give 10/10. Will visit again.</Review>

<Name>Ruohan Hsieh< /Name><Text>Shaun has great meats and sandwiches. My favorite is their Santa Cruz sandwich. Recently I am trying to go low carb and they are so sweet to accommodate me by making it without the bread. Some places don’t wrap it well enough and it’s hard to eat a lettuce wrap sandwich without stuff falling out but schaub’s employees always made sure the lettuce wrap around the ingredients nicely so that eating it is a breeze!  And they wrap the ingredients win lots of lettuce so I never ever miss not having the bread! Love this place!</Text></record>

< Review>
I love Schaubs. High quality food and good service. However you should be careful about what you order if you have meat allergies. I am allergic to turkey and* always make sure to ask about products being turkey free. The guy working there indicated an assortment of sausages contained NO turkey, just chicken (which I have no reaction to!) Either he was wrong or their sausages were contaminated, because I ate the sausage and low and behold, I had an allergic reaction. The sausage is the only thing I've eaten where I could not identify what was inside, and turkey is my only allergy. This is a five star place but I can only give one star because food safety is important and more care needs to be taken by the workers here.<//Review>

What an unpleasant experience at Schaub's this morning because of a woman working at the meat counter. What should have been a respite from donning more than just a facemask as personal protective equipment and time to stop thinking of the dangers of and the exhaustion from the situation in which we find ourselves, there in front of me was a stark reminder that not everyone has the capacity for human empathy. The continued HARASSMENT and attack on my character by this woman at the meat counter, then at the register, for the simple request of having meat separated into two packs, left much to be desired. It took all of 5 minutes to fulfill my order, but would have been less if she had stopped talking. My experiences at Schaub have typically been pleasant.... respectful, kind and helpful people, especially Jason. I hope that one day this woman will learn kindness because one day, she will need the kindness of a stranger. It will take a lot of thought on my part to get me back into Schaub, and if I do, I will ensure that this woman will not be the one with whom I interact.<//text>

<Text>I purchased 3 lbs of skirt steak for a dinner party and found out the next evening just before the group arrive we had been given 3.5 lbs of Fred's steak (about the same price overall, and therefore I did not read the label carefully).
The Schaub crew was very professional and kindly replaced the order without question, even without a receipt.  They even gave me a credit for the slight difference in price in my favor!
Not many stores would do this.
I would definitely go back.  The skirt steak was delicious.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Great place to get your meats and staff is friendly.  They also cut the meat the way you want it too.  Was looking for some stew meat that is usually all cut up .  Instead, I picked the type of meat I wanted and they cut it for me into stew pieces.</review>

The Fred Steak from Schaub's is a local institution. It's so go in fact that it surpasses the steaks at most of the local restaurants but you can only buy it here. The recipe is a secret and the copy cats aren't close.

The steak is jet black and not very appealing, for me that's half the fun, shocking guests with such an unappetizing piece of meat. Any concerns they might have had disappear the moment they taste it however.

Guests from out of town now request the Fred Steak when they visit because it is such a treat.<//text>

Don't let the gruff butchers deter you.  This place has a terrific selection of, er, meat, fish and poultry.  Highlights are their dry aged prime beef, artisan sausages, and, of course, the famous, black, Fred's Steak.<//Text>

Well, been buying Fred's Steak for 20 years. Wiki recipes don't come close. Like much in life, you have to, in this case, ante up big for the real thing. Never bought anything else there, and frankly, when I go, the crowd is always clustered around the mountain of pricey (some say overpriced) marinated Top Sirloin. I guess that's the cut. But someone said TriTip.<//Text>

The Fred steaks — as well as the Fred burgers which have the signature rub incorporated throughout the meat — are a bit of a local legend.</Text>

Staff is friendly, easy to get an appointment with little advance planning. Prices are on the cheaper side compared to alternatives. I’ve had better massages at other places but worth the convenience and price.<//Review>

Oh my gosh!
My first time going here and I had Tom. I was so relaxed I fell asleep 😂 The hot stones were such a nice treat, too. I am definitely going to come back as often as I can now ❤ I am hooked! Tom wore a face shield and a mask. I felt safe and taken care of. They took my temperature. The front desk woman (maybe the owner?) sanitized everything after I got up for the next client. She even disinfected the bathroom immediately after.

If anyone has never had an Asian foot massage, you go in with minimal clothing (no bra, tank top, shorts) and you keep your clothes on. The room has multiple comfy beds for different clients, but they are social distancing, so it is not full. They not only do a great foot massage but also massage the hands, arms, head, and back. For only $35! Why have I never been before?!

I’ve been here a few times. They’re well priced for a massage. Don’t use the book online feature- it’s not connected and they won’t get your appointment or message. Just call them or walk in.<//Text>

Finally tried this place with the amazing location smack dab in the middle of the Smart & Final Center with Edwards/REGAL movie theater-
I tried CiCi for one hour $45 then added another 30 mins - making it $65 for 90 mins 👍🏼😎✔️
She was strong and thorough long strong sweeping strokes with a lovely smile to boot. ABC- Always Be Covered is their motto: I believe they have many female therapists, so no need for appt. I should try the young 4’10” pony tailed girl - she looked strong & sweet. Great prices and sweet people PLUS APPLE PAY & only $1 credit card fee👍🏼😎✔️🤗

<Text>Started coming here a month or two ago....and they do amazing work with reasonable prices.  The full body massage has been my go-to so far and I always come out that place refreshed.  Always leave them a good $$ tip because of it.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The best massage ever.  The girl's name is MIA.  She found pressure points I did not know I had!  She was always monitoring if her pressure was to hard or soft.  Her English is pretty good!  I learned she was happily married - lucky guy!  Highly recommended!< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< Pics>

HAVE to give a major shout out to a local Escondido business. I have been dying for a good massage with the stress of 2020 and work i just needed to do it.  Everywhere was booked weeks out.... then I remembered ANGEL MASSAGE by the movie theater.  Not only were they better price than pretty much anywhere I checked, it was hands down (pun) the BEST massage I have ever had!  The place was clean, cute mood lighting, professional and they use a cucumber smelling oil over the lavender ( which i cant stand) Please consider giving them your business! Maro is an ANGEL!

<Review>My Sister and I chose to go to Angel Massage while she was here for a quick visit, although we walked in, we were warmly greeted, the inside decor and all of the employees were gracious, neat, and calming.  We were asked what type of massage we prefer and within minutes we were taken back to individual rooms.  We both felt our Masseuses were professional and did an amazing job of relieving our sore muscles!  We were even more amazed when we realized this very reasonable massage included deep tissue and Hot Stones!  We will definitely be returning as often as possible.<//Review>< response>

Oh my gosh!
My first time going here and I had Tom. I was so relaxed I fell asleep 😂 The hot stones were such a nice treat, too. I am definitely going to come back as often as I can now ❤ I am hooked! Tom wore a face shield and a mask. I felt safe and taken care of. They took my temperature. The front desk woman (maybe the owner?) sanitized everything after I got up for the next client. She even disinfected the bathroom immediately after.

If anyone has never had an Asian foot massage, you go in with minimal clothing (no bra, tank top, shorts) and you keep your clothes on. The room has multiple comfy beds for different clients, but they are social distancing, so it is not full. They not only do a great foot massage but also massage the hands, arms, head, and back. For only $35! Why have I never been before?!< /review>

< Review>
Usually I have a good experience here but tonight was something different. I went in for a full body massage and within the first few minutes I noticed the masseuse was sniffling and having trouble breathing out her nose. Then I noticed her wiping her nose on a tissue and then placing it down next to me on the bed. I stopped her because I was uncomfortable this and she replied that "she wasn't sick, it was just her sinuses". I ended the massage there and went to the waiting area because my boyfriend was still getting a massage. The receptionist asked why I had stopped the massage. I told her that I was uncomfortable with the masseuse wiping her nose and then touching me. She then replied "but she used a tissue"... I understand that people need to make money but the spread of bodily fluids is unhygienic whether you are sick or not.<//Review>

Did a decent job, I came late at night hurting. I've had better massages, maybe because I came so late she was tired, however I wasn't hurting when I left. Good price and good work.<//Review>

My husband bought us a couples massage her for Valentine's day. We have another place we usually go to, but here wanted to try a new place. This was our first time here and I was impressed, but all of that was ruined in the end. My husband went to hand the front desk women a tip of $10, but she asked if he could give $10 more, because it was Chinese new year and her workers had to work, also that she use to massage but could not any longer because of her back problems...on and on she went guilt tripping for an extra $10. My husband gave her the extra $10. I was unaware because I was in the restroom. When I found out I confronted her. I let her know to request a tip is unprofessional and RUDE! Good massages, but be prepared to be harassed for an extra tip. Never going back!</Text>

First off, I've never written a negative review...ever! My wife and I went to this location on Valentine's Day instead of our usual location, to try something new. I will admit, the message was excellent and everything was going great until the end. Before we left, I took out $10 to give to the lady at the front desk for a tip. She then suggested that $10 wasn't enough then preceded to ask me to tip $10 more. She first said, "oh i'm sorry, we ask for $10 for tip each masseuse because it's Chinese New Year and they have to work" followed by, "it's not like how you tip at a restaurant". Lastly, she gave a sob story saying, "I used to massag but I hurt my back and work front desk". This ruined our experience! She was completely unprofessional, rude and sneaky! Be prepared for a EXPECTED TIP(which is optional and there was not a sign posted suggesting a tip) or EXTRA! Never again will we go back, ever!</Text>

<Text>This will be the first negative review I have ever left on Yelp. A group of friends and I rented a "lake front" cabin from this agency for 4th of July weekend. Upon arrival we were disgusted with the state of the property. #036 Eye of the Eagle. DO NOT RENT FROM THIS AGENCY!

When we arrived at the home in the late afternoon (after 4pm) of 7/1/21, we were immediately concerned about the safety and cleanliness of the property. Including but not limited to: visible mold growth on the walls, ceilings and window coverings of multiple restrooms and bedrooms, non-working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, film falling and peeling from the ceiling, cracked/water damaged walls, discoloration around vents, broken vents being supported by sticks/poles, visibly damaged sealant and water damage above and below the deck, unwashed linens, stained carpets and pests including a nest of bats and countless insects.
Immediately we walked the property and began to document the damage for our own protection, additionally we opened all the windows and doors in an attempt to remove the concerning odor in the home that increased in potency as we ventured to the rooms downstairs with the most visible water and mold damage.

Our party was still arriving at the home throughout the morning and afternoon of 7/2/21 when we spoke with multiple members of your staff and it was at that time, due both to the unacceptable state of the property and the frankly disrespectful customer service agents that we made the decision to leave the home.

After finally deciding to leave the home, and ruin our holiday weekend, we requested a refund from the agency which has now refused to refund our group and is claiming that we are attempting to extort them by asking for our money back.

If you're looking for somewhere safe to stay in Big Bear, I would stay far away from this unprofessional agency and more importantly unsafe properties<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>BEWARE: VACATION RUINED BY BEDBUGS & NON-RESPONSIVE MANAGEMENT/OWNER!!!
PROPERTY: #089 CHIC CHALET
PROPERTY ADDRESS: 858 CLUB VIEW DR., BIG BEAR LAKE

Our group of 6 rented this property for 3 days the weekend of July 4, 2021. We arrived late on the evening of Friday, July 2nd. By the time we woke up the next morning, we had been literally EATEN ALIVE BY BEDBUGS!!!

Less than 12 hours after our arrival, and after numerous phone calls to property management to remedy the situation, we were driven out of there by these filthy varments and a property management team that was unresponsive, uncaring, & unprofessional.

The property manager ultimately sent two ladies over to change the bedding and vacuum the carpet. THAT IS NOT HOW YOU RECTIFY A BED BUG INFESTATION!!! To add further insult, the property manager told us they did not have enough bedding and pillows to replace what was already there infested with bedbugs. Even if they had properly resolved the bedbug situation, which they acted as if they had NO CLUE how to do, they claimed they did not have enough replacement bedding, nor a comparable property to move us to. OUTRAGEOUS!!! They should have vendors and resources available to effectively deal with such issues; yes, even on a holiday weekend.

We ultimately decided to cancel the reservation with a full refund. Big Bear Getaway offered nothing and did nothing to show any type of appreciation for our business, to try to retain our business, to compensate us for time and gas lost during our 2.5 hour drive to and from Big Bear (each way). Instead, they treated us like WE were the problem, NOT THEM AND THEIR BEDBUG INFESTED PROPERTY!!! Our request  to speak with the owner was not honored.

SHAME ON BIG BEAR GETAWAY MANAGEMENT & OWNERSHIP!!! We definitely did not feel like "guests". Your POOR handling of this situation is INEXCUSABLE! You treat people how you want to be treated...PERIOD!!!<//Review>< Rate>

Have you ever swiped right then, when you met in person you instantly regretted it? This instantly describes this property and agency.

This business is unclaimed for a reason. They are incapable of keeping up with the negative reviews and the disgusting, revolting, unsafe hazardous rentals they are pitching. This review is regarding one in particular at 247 N EUREKA DR , BIG BEAR LAKE - See attachments.

This includes - visible mold growth on the walls, hazardous electrical wiring, ceilings and window coverings of multiple restrooms and bedrooms, non-working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, film falling and peeling from the ceiling, cracked/water damaged walls, discoloration around vents, broken vents being supported by sticks/poles, visibly damaged sealant and water damage above and below the deck, unwashed linens, stained carpets and pests including a nest of bats and countless insects.

We decided to vacate the premises. This home will not pass any safety, or cleanliness requirement laws passed by the state of CA. This is a Slum, Ran by a Slum Lord (Big Bear Getaway) looking to capitalize on unsuspecting guests of what looks like a nice property. They are deceiving at best with no regard to the health and safety of their customers. They want to ring the cash register...

This property has been reported to the city of Big Bear and hopefully they will remedy the flat out ignored issues with this home.<//Review>

I booked a cabin and a few days before hand they call and tell me they had to cancelk it. No apologies, no offer for a future discoint or any compensation. Just called and told me they have to cancelk it and will refund me then hing up. I'm pretty understanding that emergencies happen but at least be kind enough to apologize or try to do something to not co oketely screw over the renter. Now it's so late I cannot find another place for the dates I need at any price I can afford. Do not plan a trip using this agency.<//Text>

CABIN # 36 Eye of the Eagle was DIRTY AND DATED! Just spent three days/nights there and realized as soon as we arrived the place had not been properly cleaned. We had to wash the linens because they were dirty. WE found rat droppings under the couches and beds. We also found a dead bat in one of the bedrooms which clearly shows the house was not cleaned properly before we arrived. When I called to report the dead bat I was asked if I wanted to dispose of it or if I would like someone sent out. I asked for someone to be sent out thinking they would come and properly disinfect the room but NO all the maintenance guy did was pick it up with a plastic bag and left. So many broken items and furniture it was hard to report all of them when we arrived because as the days passed we noticed more and more filth and broken things. Access to the lake was not easy either. The dust was so bad half of our party got horrible allergies. I hope we don't get some other illness related to the rat droppings.<//Review>

we rented a cabin from these agency through  Airbnb . It was the worst experience ever, we found a mouse in the house and we talked to the owner, the owner just said that they don't have any vacant place to give to use and he was super rude and impolite. he said %90 of the house the have mouse in it and he was trying to downplay a the situation. we have to drive back home at midnight . No one should use this a agency it has a terrible review on yelp too. you can just check it out</review>

Great comfortable and cozy little cabins. They have everything you need so you dont need to bring anything other than food, and the scenery is beautiful and peaceful.</review>

We had the worst experience , we paid a lot of money to have a week of relaxation, and to our surprise, the house was not only dirty, kitchen cabinets falling apart and not maintain, kitchen pots old and rusty without handles, sticky counter tops, 2 microwaves and none of them work, WiFi connection terrible, TV not working or services are limit, the hot tub is hot, but does not work and you are not allowed to touch it! The linens, furniture, mattress with holes and old, The carpet was full of dust and dirty. I mean everything is just not as we expected or imagine the management will take care! This is not COV19 friendly as they don’t seem to care or clean this house! Management got our complains and never call us back or came to see all the issues , the mice 🐁 were the cherry on the top as we caught 3 of them, my husband clean the patio because we couldn’t not take it anymore ! We just got back on Saturday and until Today, not a single phone call to apologize or nothing! It is disgusted, the patio, bbq area and furniture full of dirt and old! So,please stay in a hotel or a better place or find an exclusive rental company where people take pride of their jobs and property’s, but most of all that they care about their clients well being while they are suppose to be relaxing and enjoying a vacation !</text>< pictures>

<date>1593531742680< /date><Rate>2</Rate><Review>I personally don’t post many reviews but feel compelled to inform people about this vacation rental company in case you have expectations of staying at a nice, well taken care of, clean cabin. To be fair, let me begin with the PROS: the location of the cabin was ideal. It was close to everything in town and in a quiet, culdesac neighborhood. The home was also a nice size for a big family get-together, with plenty of space for parking.

Now to the CONS: We stayed in cabin #68 “White bear lodge.” When we arrived, we noticed the place was unclean (dust everywhere including areas that were black from accumulated dust/dirt left unwiped for months, cobwebs, sticky surface tops). I’m concerned that they are not abiding by COVID-19 precautions. They sent a cleaning crew the next day and we addressed the cleanliness concerns to the crew and their response was “the owners of the cabin have to pay for a deep cleaning fee.” Im not sure how true that is but it explains why there are stains and accumulated dirt/dust all throughout the house. Parts of the home were also falling apart such as the plywood coming Off the walls, duck-tape holding wooden staircase together, ripped cushions and stains on multiple couches, linens had strands of hair in them. The fridge was broken, fans are broken and do not work, it was 83 degrees in the home when we arrived. They sent 3 maintenance men to work on the fridge (which they were here until after 9pm) and the maintenance man mentioned the back of the fridge had been clogged, not well kept, preventing the fridge from cooling because of lint/dust buildup. Decks were dust filled, couldnt Even walk on them. It was difficult at first to get a hold of management (we arrived on Saturday and front desk said management wasn’t available until Monday, then later said a manager was coming in on Sunday) and once we finally did, they admitted to being aware of the condition of the home, didnt try to defend the issues we mentioned and yet still rent this place out and are very misleading on the website about it (they only post the good reviews on their website, but look on yelp & google where you will find more accurate reviews). Management said the best they can do is refund the cleaning fee. This is Poor Customer service for a company to mislead consumers into renting this home for over $600 Per night, knowing the condition it is in. They refused to give any type of refund and did not try to fix the issue by allowing us to stay at another cabin. We ended up staying because we already paid for the place and trying to find a place last minute was difficult, and we didn’t want to spend any more money than we already did.

I also found online reviews from other people with the same concerns, specifically with this cabin, the issues still not addressed, and they continue to rent this place out.</Review>< pictures>

In our last trip, we reserved a cabin through Big Bear Getaway Co, as we trust to some positive comments, but unfortunately this company ruined our trip. Their cabin no 021 was very old with poor maintenance. The carpet, sofa and beds are disgusting with so many spots on them. Their bathroom and toilet seat were not clean at all. Be careful if you are traveling with your kids. You can find a lot of broken or damaged items every where specially in games room. You can even catch some of them in the current pictures in their website. They charged us similar price compare to the other cabins in Big Bear plus 180 USD cleaning fee but technically they do not deserve it. They should renovate their entire cabin and change all of their bed sheets and towels. Their beds, mattress, sheets and covers are horrible. All beds  make a lot of noises, and with so many spots on them. you can not sleep during the night.  You must avoid this company as long as they do not renovate their entire properties. We asked them at least refund us the cleaning fee but their customer service did not reply back to us. Just a friendly advice, you can find better option with a same price but with high quality in Big Bear.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c4b39636590795:0x389446750a3baaf5<//gmapID></record>

<Review>My family and I stayed at the Bearly Inn Cabin. The cabin was beyond great! It met all of our expectation a and more. There were so many small touches throughout the house, this kitchen was fully stocked including spices, condiments in the refrigerator, more than enough kitchen supplies. The bathrooms had plush towels, full sized toiletries, there were plenty of game boards, firewood, BBQ accessories, all the mattresses were comfy, plenty of extra CLEAN bedding, air mattresses and good supply of extra paper goods. The owners and PM company really do their best to ensure the guest are to taken care of and feel welcomed. The reservation process was easy and staff was friendly. We had an electrical issue and they send someone over in 15 minutes on a Sunday morning.  The only negative was the parking. 3 cars barley fit in the driveway and it is very inclined. So it's hard on smaller cars but there is additional parking in the alley. Other than that, this cabin is a great choice for a family, it offers something for everyone with plenty of room.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Unfortunately, one star is the only way that I can show how terrible was our experience with this company. Please give yourself a favor and don’t waste your time and money with booking a place with this company. The word “Clean” doesn’t mean anything to them.
The stove and the counter were so greasy and dirty, to use. Empty water bottles around the rooms from the last tenants and noisy beds are nothing in compared with the dirty dining table and the carpets. Don’t let me even to start on how dirty the bed sheets and blankets were! Even the toilet seats were not clean too. I took my complains to their office and they didn’t even care about what I had to say.

<Review>The cabin we stayed #42, had a dead rat, active mouse traps and the kids found a pair of panties from a previous guest underneath their bed. We were disappointed with the cleanliness of the cabin. The city and lake are beautiful, next time will just stay somewhere else.< /Review><user_name>Katarina Norman<//user_name><Date>1501015198985</Date><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

Our short excursion to big bear was made possible by big bear getaway. We enjoyed our time in the snow and relished the time together in the lodge/chalet. It was both warm and inviting as we lounged together as a family. Thanks.<//review>

It was ok just the cabin was bad it. Flooded water in our bathroom, the sink was broken, and the heater was not working. But big bear itself was beautiful and wonderful. I loved the snow so much.</Review>

<Text>My family stayed in one of the cabins for three night's. An although the cabin was aesthetically pleasing. Half of the "amenities" didn't even work. Refrigerator didn't get cold, bath tubs leaked, karaoke machine did not work either, ants everywhere when we got to the cabin. We reported to Big Bear Getaway. The response completely unbelievable," these thing sometimes happen because they are rented out cabin's".  I have NEVER had the problem at any of the cabins I have ever rented in Big Bear Before until I rented from Big Bear Getaway. The girl in the office not helpful at all since she is the one who gave the response. I will definitely be back to Big Bear,but not with Big Bear Rental.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< time>

<review>The customer service is horrible. We have received no confirmation, receipts of any sort. I basically have to do their job and follow up. When I originally spoke to a woman she said they call 15 days before our stay to pay for the rest. No one called. So I called. And when a woman answered she said she was going to charge the card on file that she doesn't know what happen. I let her know that's not the card we want to use. We want to pay with something else. She basically told me too bad I have to charge this card. I said my bf gets home from work in a few hours. I'll call with another card. She said if she doesn't hear from me by the afternoon she will call me. NEVER happened and she charged my card anyways!!! They are so rude, disorganized! A monkey can run this place better than them! They should be embarrassed of how poor their work ethics are! I am now terrified to see what's in the house after reading the infestations they have.!</review>< Rating>

The bed sheets were clearly dirty.  The towels were chosen from dark colors so you couldn't say if they are clean or not. But worse than these problem, was the poor quality of their customer service. They really don't care about your problems.  I called to complain about the cabin's cleaning problem and I was told that the manager is not there and she will call me later, but no one ever called me. My friend was able to talk to her after several times trying,  but the manager was very irresponsible and behaved rudely.
The furniture were old and the beds make soooooo much noise. Also, The carpet was really dirty.
We go to big bear several times a year but I am sure that we will not rent a cabin from this company ever<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

What a horrible company, worst customer service I have seen, customer means nothing to them, house was dirty and the company was totally ok with it being dirty! Don’t ruin your vacation with them. They don’t even clean the bed sheets. Their services are very bad, interestingly they already know it and more interestingly they don’t want to do anything about it.< /text>

The staff, Nannette and Brittany are the bestest, was very helpful and quite pleasant throughout the booking process and even after we arrived.

<Text>Got a fantastic cabin off of Airbnb through these folks and it was everything we expected and more. The cabin was decorated absolutely adorably, immaculately clean, and the kitchen was well-stocked with flatware, dishes, pots, pans etc even beyond the basics such as coffee, cooking oil and pancake syrup. Check in/check out instructions were super clear, wifi was a big plus and the tv's even had cable. The fireplace was super cozy but the cabin had pretty intense central heating as well. The backyard completely fenced in for our dog and the location was about 100 steps from the ski slopes. We could not have asked for anything more. Thank you for the great "Big Bear Getaway" weekend!< /Text>< date>

Cabin was nice, but dirty. for the 100$ cleaning deposit not a lot is offered. You have to remove all of your trash, and wash all of the dishes. The cabin could be cleaned better also. We had to kill 4-5 spiders while we stayed there. We stayed in cabin #62  Aspen Cabin. Might be good if they invested in some sort of pest control, and maid service.< /text>

Me and my family planed our first Christmas vacation with this business 6 months ahead of time. We paid for the 1st half of the cabin rental 6 months in advance as requested.  This was supposed to be a special Christmas for my 3 little girls and family. We have been looking forward to it all the way up until a month away from Christmas, when we received a phone call from bigbeargetaway saying the cabin we paid for is no longer available and we can have our money back or book one of there cabins they have left which are far and few between this time of year.they refused to make up for any of there mistakes and ruining the first vacation we have ever been able to take. I spoke to the owner Brandon who was very rude and told me that they had other cabins that were comparable to the one we had purchased, but it would be more money and  he will not make up the difference. So maybe next year we can try this again with a good faith honorable company.< /Review>< pictures>

The building was beautiful and clean !! My wife and I left for dinner and when we came back my door to cabin has been unlocked and opened , still ajar . I know I locked the door , on the ground  I found a set of keys  they had big bear getaway logo key chain .  Immediately I felt violated  The keys appeared as if they were in employees  The house was for sale but I did not understand why someone would come  between  4 o'clock and  9 o'clock at night on a Sunday without notifying me.   During that time  me and my new wife were at the movies.  I had just gotten married  the night before so after dinner and a movie my new wife and I were going to open our gifts . At the time I could not tell if any of our gifts were missing, so I'm check out day the next morning after feeling completely violated barely sleeping at night worried for the safety of me in my l so I'm check out day the next morning after feeling completely violated ,I barely sleept that night worried for the safety of my wife , so I sat at door with my shoot gun , The next morning I brought it to management attention. She said something like this had never happened I replied how did these keys end up on the ground in front of my door  markedwith your company keychain and the number 34 just like my keychains you gave me I have my two sets where did this third one come from?  She says I don't know maybe someone lost them before maybe they came from the homeowner. If anyone could tell someone was line it was right now I've never seen anyone so nervous telling me a lie and when you have a 12-year-old kid you can tell when someone is lying this lady was lying , so I asked next what's the policy when someone loses a key she replied we charge them $10 then I replied if you charge of $10 do you Re key the doors  she said no that would be the homeowners responsibility also reminding me if any of my stuff was stolen they were not liable very rudely said at that. At this point I was so upset with the lack of respect this woman has shown me and my wife we were violated  on our wedding night this company does not have a secure key system chances are someone in their company is the one sneaking around possibly stealing stuff or since they don't change the locks when someone loses a key any criminal can just come in and pay 10 bucks and still from you the next time this sucks this place sucks chances are you have a negative experience and when you tell management they don't give a bleep  don't understand how a company will charge you $95 cleaning fee but won't take out your trash it will charge you $25 for each paper in each trashcan so be careful but if you lose the keys of the place it's only $10 you might as well come back whenever you want vacation nightmare vacation nightmare vacation</Review>

<text>BUYER BEWARE!  Once your trip is confirmed, at the very bottom of your email, after directions, you will see their contract. The list for what they can charge you is VERY long and includes CHARGING YOU IF YOU DON'T TAKE YOUR OWN TRASH TO THE DUMP!! THEY CHARGE YOU IF ALL OF YOUR DISHES AREN'T CLEAN WHEN YOU LEAVE. AND YOU PAY A CLEANING FEE OF $110!!!  You will notice that they can also charge for just about anything they want and you have no recourse. By taking the keys, you are saying that all costs are valid, as defined by them, and any disputes will be settled in small claims court in San Bernadino or Big Bear Lake. Oh, and they will also charge you if you leave food in the refrigerator.  I always rent cabins and houses when I travel and I have never seen usury like this!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>Cabin #12 was infested with ants, full of cobwebs and NOT lakefront. When I called, I was told ants in the mountains was a normal occurrence.  But in the bedroom, a few in the bed, in the dishwasher, coming out from behind the oven, and all over the kitchen counters, the couch, both bathrooms. Yuck.<//text>< gmapID>

Wonderful space for working and studying. Very nice and kind people work here. I always ask them to serve my drinks in their cups. Just tell them it’s for here. The drinks are much better than Starbucks. The only problem is that they don’t have a restroom, so you have to leave your bags in there and go to the Tender Greens to use the restroom. When the weather is good, the outside patio is also a great place to sit and work.<//review>

Grabbed a sandwich in the lobby and it was okay. I have never actually had food at Peet's Coffeeand while it wasn't bad, it wasn't good either. The young man taking the orders that day didn't seem to want to be working as he was not friendly or personable in any way.</Review>

Delicious hot chocolate and the waiters are very nice. They made me a white chocolate hot chocolate even though it wasn't on the menu, and it was delicious.

I'd highly recommend for anyone looking for quality hot drinks in this plaza, it's the best there is here.</Text>

The drinks are great and the employees are wonderful. Unfortunately the manager Zac Wright does not treat his employees well and penalizes them for his poor judgment. There are other places to get coffee, I would rather spend my money at a store that treats their employees better.<//text>

Delicious coffee. Especially I like the vanilla flavored ones. The downside is that I think it is a little bit expensive. Usually it is crowded and has many customers but still feels like a comfortable place.</Review>

Service has been exceptionally good every time I come here. Lines are short, but tables are always full. I always take mine to go, so it's not a problem. Their winter special (Godiva pecan) is amazing, but I'm not a coffee connoisseur.< /Review>

The WiFi is acceptable. For Irvine, that is mandatory at minimum, especially being this close to University of California Irvine.

Came in here recently on a work from home day as I had an errand earlier that day to run. After finding a table close to a power AC outlet, I plugged my laptop in and started crunching some infrastructure-as-code.

This cafe is well ventilated which is really important during hot Irvine summers, which speaks to how well the HVAC systems are here. That's a damn good thing.

Located in University Center, if you need to stand up for a stretch break, there are plenty of places to swing by nearby, including but not limited to: Eureka, Gen Grill, Amazon Prime at Irvine, Slap Fish, Blaze Pizza, even a United States Post Office! There are options a-plenty here.

Drinks here are ok. Noticed I saved drinks for last? It's actually not anything spectacular but nothing terrible either.

Oh and they take mobile payments here like Apple and Google Pay.<//Text>

uhhhh my favorite place to grab a vanilla latte. the choices are nice. the baristas always seem to do espresso justice. the place is always stocked with complimentary spices to enhance my drink. the wifi is nice to have. most of the time the baristas start your order without them waiting for you to surrender your money which is always special every time.< /text>

I get a simple coffee at Starbucks with steamed heavy cream which they will charge me an additional $0.60. The gal at Peet's rang me up for $0.60 and when the barrista I don't know his name skinny jerk with minimal facial hair started screaming it was a dollar fifty. I should have gotten the  baristas name because he was a rude little man. I canceled my order and told them I'm going to go to Starbucks ......I'll stick with Starbucks when I have the choice<//text>

<Review>This was my first time coming to this office, as I was referred here by my dentist to have my wisdom teeth removal done at Allure. It was a great experience! The front desk staff were very welcoming and nice. The technician who did my X-rays was extremely nice and so was the dentist who is going to remove my wisdom teeth. One of the first things I noticed too was how nice this facility was. By far the nicest I've ever been to. I will definitely be back to receive more care here!<//Review>< Date>

I was happy here until...
Be careful, they will sell you on laser (incision, a cut in your gums to get bacteria into it to cause infection) that can sabotage your health, then drop you if you don't follow thru with their costly advise of procedures.  Even if you were a very good customer and had them do a lot already, just maintenance work ain't enough income for greed.

Not sure but it seems the quality of things here in HB has slowly been going down since 2013-2017. What gives?<//text>

This is my second time at Allure dental and I’m here to stay. After my long time dentist retired a few years ago I’ve been trying to find a dental office I’m comfortable at. The dentist was very informative and put out a no pressure future dental plan for me (since I have no pressing issues) after my exam. The hygienist is amazing! She does such a thorough job and I never leave sore. The office is very clean and they follow Covid protocol. I’ve referred a few friends already. I’m not quick to write a review so this one is well deserved. Definitely give them a try, you won’t be disappointed.<//text>

I absolutely love this dentist office. Everyone here is so nice, you easily feel comfortable. Most of the dental staff are a really sweet Italian-American family that I feel like I just get along with so well. Dr. Miele explains what he is doing, as he is doing it, and always checks in to make sure you're okay along the way. I've been coming here since December and am so happy to find a place I feel comfortable going to.</review>

Had my first visit at Allure Dental today. The place is state of the art , very clean and follows all of the COVID protocol. The staff is warm, friendly and knowledgeable . Dr Miele is gentle  and I immediately felt at ease. Thank you to my daughter for referring Dr. Miele and Allure to me.</Text>

I had previously seen another dentist who said it was necessary to extract the tooth because she was too young for a root canal.  Dr Salehani advised me that was not necessary and the only thing we had to do was to shave down the tooth for a better bite. I m glad there are still honest people out there.  I am changing my dentist to Allure Family Dental from this point on.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Had my first dental visit in allure family dental group, and I’m very happy this experience!
Face mask is required, and they let me wash my hands before the examination, everything feels safe and professional.
Doctor Frank was very patient, and he explained all the details to me and answered all my questions, I’m very happy with my first visit, and looking forward for the following ones!<//Review><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I have been here for the past 3 years and they all, from the front desk to the assistants and all the way to the dentists, have given a very friendly and caring experience. They do their best to get the job done so you can arrive at clean teeth that feel like smooth porcelain. If the process ever feels rough, let them know and they will kindly adjust to your needs. Licking my teeth at this very moment to confirm that it is 5 star service.<//text>

<review>I have been with the Allure Family Dental office for almost 5 Yrs now and my experience has always been a great one!---Dr. Miele has done a bone graft and bridge work for me plus an extraction totally pain free as he's a very kind and considerate dentist!
His daughter is my hygienist whom I see quarterly also. An In-house Endodontist helped me with a root canal problem on a Saturday morning as well. Emergency services are available so you are not left untreated.

Allure was sanitized, friendly and high quality professional treatment. The technician who did my teeth cleaning was great. She was very knowledgeable and did precise.

I returned today for a 2nd consultation for another service.  The Dr. answered all my questions and the receptionist also.  They are kind and professional. Not to mention...the office and rooms are sterile.  I recommend the dentist office also for their diversity and dental specialist for  services.< /text>

< Review>
I was hesitant. I’m one of those cry babies who dread going to the dentist. From the moment I walked in I was put at ease. The front staff were pleasant and attentive. They actually read my paper work and learned of my anxiety. The dental assistant was reassuring and accommodating. She was also very gentle when she took my XRays... c’mon you know it hurts to bite down sometimes.
Dr. Miele was wonderful. Talking to him was like talking to a friend who wanted to help me make the right and informed decisions about my dental plan.

The office was clean and they used caution and care to mitigate any risk of Covid contact.

Thank you so much for your service and care!<//Review>

I had severe tooth ache suddenly hit me on a Friday evening and by Saturday morning it was clear that I had to take action. So Alllure was not only open on Saturday but they took me in and got me on the path of recovery faster than I expected. And while I expected to get a lecture for allowing this to occur, I instead received empathy and professionalism that simply focused on my resolution. Everyone from the receptionists to the dental Assistants to the Dentist themselves were friendly and a pleasure to work with. To cap it off the dental office itself is the cleanest and most well kept one I've ever seen. Overall I'd highly recommend Allure Dental to any of my family or close friends.< /Review>

Awesome!  They helped set me up with insurance, were able to take me for an emergency appointment for my first visit.  Have been following up with them with additional work since.  The desk staff is super friendly and even more helpful.  The hygienists are pros, Dr. Miele is really knowledgeable and is great all around.</Review>

He listens to your concerns and responds with detailed information about your dental procedure and dental health in general. I am happy with his work and professionalism.  Let’s face it dental visits are no fun but I am comforted knowing i’m in good hands with Dr. Miele. I recommend for your next 6 month check up that you reserve an appointment with him. 👍🏼</text>< response>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Allure Family Dental is a great place to go when you need the proper dental care. Not only it's located at a prime spot in HB, but the staff is super friendly, and very prompt. I personally dealt with Doctor Franco Miele, who is an excellent dentist: he knows how to make you feel comfortable, and at ease if you happen to be someone that feels anxious just by the thought of going to see a dentist. I highly recommend dropping by whenever you need dental care.<//Review>< pictures>

<Name>Ailene Zayas< /Name><Date>1594905674271< /Date><Rate>5</Rate><review>Md. Miele at Allure Dental is wonderful man.  He listens to your concerns and thoroughly answers all your questions  with patience and kindness.  I  find him to be quite knowledgable  and am impressed with his attentiveness! I have been going to him for regular visits for the past year and a half and have not been disappointed.
I also fond his staff to be so helpful with obtaining information from my insurance about coverage and copays. There have been times when I have made an appointment and if an earlier time becomes available, they call me to see if I want to change my time.
If you need a new dentist or a specialist ( that's what I needed initially and led me to Allure Dental), pay them a visit. Take advantage of their new patient special. It is greatly worth it! I already did my research on them and I can honestly say I am so pleased it paid off!  That's why they get a 5 star rating!  Thank you Md. Miele and staff, you have made my dental experience with you a wonderful one!< /review>< pictures>

I have had two more visits to this office during the Covid crisis and both times the office was in complete compliance. The staff was wonderful and my dental hygienist was amazing. Cassandra made my visit stress free, pain free and did a perfect job on my mouth. I love this place.

My first appointment was this morning. Dr. Miele and his staff were so friendly, helpful, caring and professional, I left feeling that I had found the perfect dental practice. I would and will recommend them to everyone. And if you are wondering...they have taken every precaution to protect you and themselves from Covid-19. I felt completely safe.< /Text>

Best dental experience ever!  State of the art technology with a cooking show to watch while the hygienist did a painless thorough cleaning.   Easy location with plenty of parking, very clean and modern with an upbeat staff and excellent kind dentist giving different options for future possibilities for cosmetic upgrades.  Couldn't be happier with this dental switch!</Review>

The staff was very professional. Dr M. had an emergency during my visit and had to attend to another patient. But instead of just letting me sit there, they offered me water and the cable channel switcher. Very considerate. When I did get to see Dr M, he did answer all of the questions patiently and thoroughly. Cassandra was also very patient, knowledgeable, and gave me a lot of good info and tips.</review>

This is the best dentist I have ever been to. It is clean, modern and nice inside. I have never had to wait a long time for an apt. Everyone who works there is so lovely and always there for me for whatever I need. They answer questions for me, they are knowledgeable about insurance and are able to professionally advise me. I have yet to be uncomfortable here, they always make sure they are gentle and put my comfort first.< /Review>

Had my first visit today. I would have to give this office 5 stars. Everyone from the front desk, my dental hygienist and Dr. Franco Miele were very kind. Doctor Miele even took the time to go through each tooth and explaining what I was seeing on the X-ray. Not to mention the office was beautiful. Thank you to the staff at Allure Family for a wonderful experience.</Review>

<Review>I came here for an emergency visit. The staff and the Dentist himself were knowledgeable and very informative about what their process is and talking you through it so that you understand what's being done. The front desk is very friendly and inviting. The rooms are very accommodating as well as the Dr and staff. This is the kind of Dentist office I wouldn't mind coming back to for all my families dental needs.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I've been a client of Allure family dental for a year or so now and decided to take my kids to try it out there as well. My youngest daughter is usually afraid of going to the dentist, but she really liked Allure family. They were patient and kind with her and everyone on staff is very friendly!  She loved having a TV right near her chair for distraction  and the massage feature in the chairs was a big hit!!<//text>

Would recommend Allure Family Dental.  Dr. Miele and his staff are efficient, kind and so patient. They explain all the procedures and always answer all my questions.  If they don't know the answer right away, they follow through and contact me later.   The office is so modern, up to date and amazingly clean.< /text>

Today I had my teeth cleaned and was very please with the kind friendly service of the receptionist and my Dental Hygienist. I later was examined by the dentist who went over all my dental needs. Was very pleased with the time he took to explain my dental work needed. Thank you, Theresa H< /text>

Friendly staff, latest technology, over all great dentist. I would highly recommend this Dentist to anyone. Before coming here a couple years back, I spent several years hoping around from dentist to dentist because i couldn't find one I really liked it trusted.  This place changed all of that.  It has been several years now that I have been coming here as a regular, and couldn't be any more pleased,</Text>

Everyone in the office is so nice and helpful! The hygienist and doctor are very informative and answered the questions I had very well. During my first visit, I loved that the doctor explained my x rays to me and explained any spots on the image to me and why that happened. Seriously the best dental experience I’ve ever had!< /Review>

I have moved around a lot and been a patient at several dental offices and this is hands down the best office.  From front desk staff, to the hygienist, to the dentist, everyone is very welcoming, kind, and knowledgeable.  It's always easy to schedule an appointment, and both the hygienist and dentist are very gentle but provide excellent care.  I've had a few treatments beyond the routine cleaning and x-rays and have never had any issues with my treatments.  I would recommend this office and Dr. Miele to everyone!< /Text>

{'time': 1570651234701, 'text': 'Dear Rosie,\nI am sorry you feel this way and I have to say I am upset at your review as when you came in for an emergency we took care of you and squeezed you into the schedule. This is the first time of a review I am thinking about filing a lawsuit as everything you stated is correct statements which are very accusatory.\nTo answer your questions:\n1.  First we are not a big corporation but a mom and pop family run dental office that care about our patients and work to put food for our families tables and are employees\n2. You stated we scam by not billing your insurance, but you have an insurance that is an HMO that there is no billing, they do not pay the office anything for procedures, but its a discount plan on a fee schedule that we follow and the emergency you had done was not a covered procedure and if you have issues with your coverage you should switch to a better insurance plan. You were advised of this and signed consents prior to any work being done and the fee being advise to you.\n3. We are a high end dental office at middle of the road prices and the only reason we take HMO is to be able to be able to help the people in our community where I grew up.\nIt is just sad how you ask for your money back and if you do not get what you want people go on the internet and make false claims in hopes of getting a refund like extortion.\nAt the end of the day, we did the right thing and follow all guidelines and us billing the insurance is a courtesy for you, if you feel your insurance should have paid, send in your statement and have them send you the check directly.'}<//resp>

<Response>{'time': 1568173853272, 'text': 'Rosie, as you stated above, you came in for a tooth extraction. Your HMO plan was not charged out. We do not receive any payment from your insurance company for your procedure. That is how HMOs work. HMOs don\'t pay, they just have a discount patient fee schedule with the amount YOU pay. Certain procedures not listed on the plan are charged the UCR fee (usual and customary fee). On PPO plans we bill,  on HMOs there is no "billing" the insurance. The HMOs only pay $2 to $3 a month per patient to be on the HMO roster. PPO insurances pay per procedure, HMOs do not therefore many dental offices don\'t accept HMOs. If you would have had a PPO plan you would have paid less for the HMO non-covered procedures.\nYou were not coerced to do the procedures and, as with every patient, the fees are given PRIOR to the procedures and a treatment plan is signed by the patient. If the fees are not to your liking then you have the option to frequent another dentist for another estimate. You chose to have the procedure done at our office.  To offer a complaint a MONTH later after your procedure is done seem a bit peculiar. Moreover to complain about not using sedatives when you made no mention of sedatives at the treatment plan phase is also odd.  The gel is a pre-numbing agent for the injection of lidocaine. It has nothing to do with sedation. If you wanted general anesthesia then you should have mentioned that prior to starting the procedure and we would have referred you to an oral surgeon. I have\nliterally done thousands of extractions with gel/lidocaine, like most general dentists do, with no issues. My technique\nof numbing and waiting for proper anesthesia and then giving a bit more lidocaine just prior to the extraction ensures complete anesthesia and comfort. I recall that we had no issue with the anesthesia and you were completely numb for the procedure. Again if you wanted sedation (to be "out" for the procedure) you should have said so and you would been referred to an oral surgeon who would charge $1500 for sedation alone.\nWe are a high end office.  We are not the least expensive but we are not the most expensive either. We charge mid range for items that are not listed on the discounted fee procedure list. We go by the discount fee list and charge only UCR for procedures that are not on the list.\nHopefully with this understanding of how dental HMO\'s work and how sedation is NOT the standard for  extractions (by the way, HMOs don\'t cover sedation), I would appreciate if you would remove your post. Moreover, it is  SLANDER to post that we billed your insurance when we did not. You can check with your insurance plan to verify.  After verifying, please remove the slanderous post.'}< /Response><time>1568073826914</time>< GmapID>

< Review>
Expert dentist who has a wonderful "bedside" manner!  Very calm and soft-spoken which I believe is what you need when you go to the dentist because most of us do not like to be there at all!  The dental assistants, hygienist and the staff are really friendly. I think they make a really great team, highly recommend!< /Review>

<review>I was having a major tooth ache for about 2 weeks.. My original dentist could’nt find anything wrong when he looked at my x-rays.. I went back a few times and made them look again at my x-ray.. After the 3rd time, they finally saw I had an infection.. So I needed an Endodontist.. I found one in the area where I work.. From the moment I walked into a Allure Family Dental, they made me feel so comfortable.. I was in pain when I was there and needed emergency extraction to my back molar.  Dr. Benjamin Levi first consulted with me and gave me a few options.. He was so incredibly nice and tenative to my needs.. He actually cared!  I chose to extract my tooth.. So, Dr Franco Miele took me under his care and literally explained everything he was about to do..  I left Allure Family Dental feeling so happy that after spending about 2 weeks sick to my stomach.. I can’t thank them enought for their amazing services!! I swear this was the best experience at a Dental Office ever in my life..  Thank you so much Allure Family Dental!!

< Review>
I’ve never been comfortable with dental offices partly because of my negative experiences with them and partly because my teeth are always making me go to them. I moved to HB a few years back where I came across Allure Family Dental in a magazine. I thought I would give it a try. I’m so glad I did, seriously. I never write reviews ... until this one because everyone should know about this place ! They accept a lot of different types of insurances/dental plans. They have a patient, kind, and knowledgeable staff from the front desk ladies, Gina and Yvonne to their dentists and dental assistants. Everyone makes you feel super comfortable and they explain to you what’s actually going on along with showing you on their screens so you can try your best to understand just as much as they do. Their offices are always clean and the dental chairs have massage balls in them to help you stay relaxed ! They have flat screen TVs in each room also. I know this sounds like it would be expensive but their prices are fair especially for the service you are receiving. My dentist Dr. Miele is amazing ! I don’t love going to the dentists but they definitely do make my trip a heck of a lot easier and smoother ! I hope my review has helped whoever has read it :)</Review>

< Review>
I was there last week, though the fees were not the cheapest, the office was gorgeous, very clean and Dr. Miele and Dr. Levi both saw me and were very professional and nice and made me feel very comfortable though I was nervous.  I had to get a deep cleaning which I expected as I had not been to a dentist in 3 years, but I have to say they did not sell me on treatment I did not need. I was told I need 3 root canals, and Dr. Levi was there that day and being a specialist he saw me and said I did not need root canals and I got my crowns and everything is great. Thank you</Review>

I love Allure Family Dental. Not only is it a well-decorated, clean, state-of-the-art facility, but Dr. Miele and Dr. Levi are excellent professionals. They listen to your needs and perform exceptional work with minimal to no pain or discomfort. Highly recommended!!!< /text>

<rating>5</rating><review>Very impressed with the appearance of the front entrance and every exam room with state of the art equipment/technology..every staff member was pleasant and knowledgeable. They did not rush thru my exam and exray process. DR. Miele spent time (not rushed) to explain the results of my exam. The whole staff seamed to enjoy working for Dr.Miele. the hours of operation are convenient.
Oh, so a bonus..they are located next to my favorite store..the dollar store..😉

<review>We have been coming to Dr. Miele for sometime now and we leave very happy and satisfied every single time. I must say I'm not the biggest fan when it comes down to visiting a dentist office, but every staff member manages to make you feel comfortable and in very good hands. Not only is he professional and very good at what he does, but he also LISTENS to your concerns and always has the best explanation as well as solutions to them. The front desk ladies are very pleasant and friendly which is a plus, and are always willing to work around your schedule and accommodate you. I highly recommend this office if you are looking for honest, efficient, professional dentists. The whole personnel works together on making you a priority, and not wait for hours to be seen. HMO and PPO are accepted and also care credit! Call today to make your appointment you won't be disappointed :)</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I've been seeing Doc Miele for about 10years.
He has seen my children my husband and anyone else I can refer to him. He is not only an exceptional Dentist but human being as well. I trust him to always have my best interests in mind.  I have had horrible experiences when I was younger. Finding Dr. Miele is truly a blessing. Btw his wife is also most excellent.
If u choose to see him u will not be disappointed.<//review>

<text>I had an amazing experience from the moment I walked in. Jeraldin was very welcoming, friendly, and informative. She made sure all of our questions were answered.  We were then helped by a very nice young lady named Carina, she truly made my experience an enjoyable one. She is definitely the reason I am coming back.  Carina made sure I was comfortable and relaxed through out the entire process.  She then introduced us to Dr. Miele.  Dr. Miele explained everything to me and answered all my questions.  Other dentist offices I have been to in the past talk among themselves and dont explain the importance of what needs to be done.  Overall I would recommend this place to everyone.  Thank you Carina and Dr. Miele for making my experience so enjoyable.  This will definitely be my go to dentist from now on.< /text>< time>

Got the ad in the mail, and I was skeptical to be honest, but when I went in I was amazed how pretty and gorgeous the office was. It was like walking in Caesars Palace, all nice marble floors, and the staff was friendly.

I dont have the best insurance but they did accept my insurance which left me in amazement because when I saw the place I said to myself, " this nice of an office wont take my insurance" but they did.

The doctor was very friendly and professional,  He made me very comfortable,   I had my cleaning by the hygienist and it was great, I was always use to the doctor doing a 5 min cleaning but she spent 45 minutest and though I also need a deep cleaning in one part of my mouth it was worth the little bit I had to pay to keep my teeth.

I read the other review that was on here, and reason I put it on was because I disagree with the other reviewer. Office staff made me feel at home, and I was not told I need treatment that was not necessary.

I will send all my friends here.  Dr. Miele you are the BEST !!!!   PS  It did not hurt on this visit :)< /review>

This last thursday I had a severe toothache and I had no idea where to go as I just moved her from San Francisco. I was reluctant of going to a new place, because you here of crappy dentist that just bill for work that does not need to be done, as well as the office looking like a clinic. There was a dental office that was in the shopping center where I go to get lunch, Boudin. I passed by and always saw the sign so I decided to go in, and I wont lie I had gone to 5 places prior that my insurance provider said was in network.

Other offices had dirty reception areas, were not friendly, the office was old, and some of the rooms I went in you can tell the chairs were old, which relates probably to the work they do.

This office was so clean and new, I felt I was like in Beverly Hills, but was hoping the fees were not the same. I was greeted by Yvonne, that was very busy as she explained they are a new office and after she was done finishing with another customer, greeted me told me about the office. I was talking to her and Dr. Levi walked up front and greeted me and was very nice and saw I was apprehensive and gave me a free tour, but said he was not the doctor doing the exam because he is a specialist.

The office was gorgeous, nice clean spotless floor, room where they clean the instruments was very clean and the chairs had massagers which was like "oh my god" this is awesome. I decided to do my exam, and the cleaning was done by a hygienist which the doctor said would be the best because he said a dentist does not clean as well as they do, and there is no fee difference and wanted the best care for me.

On my exam the doctor found that I had a little chip on my tooth exposing the inside of the tooth a little making it sensitive. He put a filling that my insurance paid for and I was on my way. Few days later I am in no pain.

I hate dentists, but he made it a great experience and I am a patient for life<//text>

<text>I brought my partner for a dental check since he had a crack on is back tooth, I was comfortable at the waiting area since the place was quite a nice view, when my partner returned, he told me how good the doctors were, the people are very nice, they're very clean with their work, and my partner would want to return for further check ups. I might be a customer too, next time, if I need any dental checks.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>I got the coupon for the cleaning and exam and x rays for 49.00 and was skeptical to be honest like the other person had in the review below but I gave it a shot.  Went in and got the exam and x ray and the Dentist, Dr. Miele was great, very gentle, nice, humble and told me everything I need, some things urgent others not.
I could not get my cleaning that day as he explained to me in that office the dentist does not do the cleanings but the hygenist which is their specialty and I would get a better cleaning that way. I saw the Hygenist tuesday and it was the best cleaning ever, spend 45 minutes cleaning my teeth and got a varnish so prevents cavities for 4-6 months.. Worth every penny I paid and they got a patient for life. Thank you Allure Family Dental< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

{'time': 1534979086431, 'text': 'Sorry for you not having a good experience.  I was suppose to be at work that day, but due to injuring my ligament on my leg and being in the emergency room and to be on crutches that day I had to miss work. Dr. Quan was seeing a lot of my patients and emergencies and he was overwhelmed and reason the schedule was running a little behind.  Also you were an HMO patient and we get no reimbursement taking x rays which is for your well being to see if there are any infections in your teeth, and taking x rays on HMO patients is actually a loss for us and not any income comes from it as HMO insurances do not pay the office for procedures done. I hope we can make it up to you in the future.'}</Response>

Stay away from this office!! Very unprofessional service. I came for cleaning and after 1 h 15 min I was still waiting for cleaning. This office have 2 doctors who don’t even share charts or any other information. This office is in business of making money with their X-ray machine; however, they have no interest in patients’ well being.</review>

I just came back from by far the most upsetting encounter with a health "professional" I've ever had. Let me preface this by saying Dr. Miele has been great. He takes the time to simplify complex procedures, and it truly seems like he cares.

This entire review is about my experience with Yvonne, his front desk receptionist. I am scheduled for a routine exam and cleaning. Dr. Miele takes lots of x-rays, and explains procedures I will need in the future. He mentions that he recommends a "deep cleaning" which requires numbing and antibiotics. I ask if I can get a standard cleaning/polishing this time, and get the deep cleaning another time, since I'll be going on vacation next week. He replies and says that he isn't sure if my insurance will cover the deep cleaning next time, but he totally understands if I just want the standard clean/polish so my teeth look good for vacation.

Enter Yvonne. She takes me to a room, lists out multiple thousands of dollars of procedures that I need (including the deep cleaning). I tell her that I would like just the routine cleaning and I'll hold off on the deep one, as well as what the cost of a routine one is. She gives me the foulest look and in an extremely condescending tone says, "I heard what the doctor said to you, he did not give the OK for a standard cleaning."  1) You're listening to a PRIVATE conversation between a dentist and his patient, Yvonne? How very professional. 2) You are completely wrong. I tell Yvonne exactly what Dr. Miele says. She says something along the lines of "I just want you to understand the difference because maybe you didn't get it the first time." Seriously? I don't know the difference between a standard cleaning (which I'm pretty sure is free under my insurance), and a cleaning that will cost me FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS!?! She walks off and says, "Let me ask the doctor, if he says yes, you can sign a waiver and make a new appointment." A new appointment? I came here to get a cleaning. My appointment was a 3 and this was happening around 4.

She walks back in, and of course, what did Dr. Miele say? Yes, it would be just fine if I wanted a standard cleaning only. But, after all of this, with this woman belittling me, having ZERO customer service skills, and essentially arguing with me as a patient, I need to make another appointment? After all of this?

No thanks. I am taking my business (I use the word specifically, because Yvonne is very eager to explain how many multiple hundreds and thousands of dollars procedures cost) elsewhere.

As a customer service professional, I would expect the front desk receptionist to be just that, a professional. What I encountered was an absolute disgrace.<//review>

<user>114027646903025586854</user><review>First off: dedicated parking right out front. For the less mobile out there this is huge.
Next: sparkling clean modern office with appropriate Covid safeguards, lots of chrome and glass that is impressively clean. This type of Decor shows the slightest blemish, I could find none.
Gina (I think) at the front desk was finishing up with a patient but managed to get me two forms that I had to sign without interrupting or slighting her current patient. Very tactful.
After a brief wait a tech came out to get me. More of the same decor and modern equipment, and a tv hanging right in front of the chair like another piece of equipment. Not a fan of the program playing, but it was at times a welcome distraction. The tech came in and told me the guy that ushered me in was on his first day at the job, poor guy was a bit nervous placing the X-ray plates in my mouth, he was doing fine but the other tech did end up helping him out in the end, I think it was taking a bit too long for his comfort. X-rays accomplished the doc came in and poked around a bit and explained areas of concern. Very concise, and that tv was now a monitor with my x-rays displayed so as to point out the offending areas.
We discussed what priorities are and he sent me back to Gina to set up an appointment for a cleaning.
Gina also said she would check my insurance to see what portion of any procedures we discussed they covered and send me this via email. I could then make my decisions on how to progress with a clear understanding of financial implications.
All in all, an outstanding first visit to Allure Dental. Of course the real nitty gritty is yet to come, I’ll keep you updated on my progress.<//review>< gmap_id>

However, it makes me very happy to know that places like this establishment still exist. The genuine care that Shant provides his customer is impeccable. Because the man loves what he does and he cares about his customers. And it shows. I love this Auto Body shop and I will never go anywhere else. No matter how much my insurance company tries to steer me to one of their DRP shops. Nope! Thank you Marina West for always looking out for me. You guys are the best!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I absolutely had to come and leave a review for Marina West Auto Body, because Shant and his team were phenomenal from day one, and continued to be thought the entire process.
This was the first time that I truly didn't worry a single bit about having my car at a body shop. There was communication the entire time,  he handled every aspect of the process with detail and professionalism.
When it came time to pick up my vehicle from Marina West Auto Body, it was detailed,  and parked out front. Shant walked around the entire car with me, and pointed out the little details that I had never even seen before, and I've owned this car for two years!!!
If you are in need of any paint and body work, Marina West Auto Body is THE place! As long as I am in the Los Angeles area, and as long as they are open, this will be the body shop that I go to, and recommend with 100% confidence.< /review>< time>

<Text>I have used this shop twice and have been very satisfied with the service and repairs. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The repairs are done in a timely manner and the work done for me has been excellent. They worked very well with my insurance and also were very reasonable when it was not an insurance claim. I would highly recommend this shop and if needed, I would use them again.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I will never go to another body shop. It is so nice to find an establishment that truly cares for their customers and goes out of their way to make the experience as painless and easy as possible. Shawn kept me updated the whole time, answered all my questions ( and boy did I have a bunch of them) and delivered my car better than I dropped it off. Its so refreshing, especially in LA when you find a business who actually cares about their customers and has great vibes. Not that I ever want to get into another accident again, but if I do at least I know I'm in good hands. Thank you Marina West....especially Shawn!<//text>< pics>

If you want an honest, courteous, and amazing body work done on your vehicle, look no farther than Shant and his team at Marina West Auto Body.

These guys are the tops customer service and pristine body work on your vehicle.  I have had Shant work on both of your vehicles and they were finished to an incredible level of quality.  Shant is very familiar with the insurance companies and he will fight to get the right parts for your vehicle and OEM parts when appropriate.  The aforementioned body work were claims through insurance for parking lot damage and highway rock damage to our Scion xB's bumper and hood.

I purchased a used vehicle that had a lot of hidden damage, which I obviously could not see.  I brought the car into Shant, and he restored the vehicle from top to bottom to better than showroom condition for an extremely fair price.  He even recommended I get the car wrapped to protect the paint, and referred me to a gentleman he had wrap all of his personal vehicles, and I had an excellent job done wrapping my car, and Shant managed the whole process with the Wrap guy, so the job would continue to be superlative.

If you want quality body work done on your vehicle at a fair price, Marina West Auto Body is the family owned business to go to.  I will bring all of my future body work needs to Shant and his team.<//Text>

<text>A Gazillion Stars - For not only dealing with my nightmare of an insurance company but also for their customer service. Shawn is the absolute best. So honest, so kind. Kept me informed the whole time during my repair and my car looked so nice after it was completed.

Having to deal with an accident is such a nightmare and inconvenience...truly, I never want to go through it again, but having a business that truly cares and actually WANTS to help, is mind blowing.

I Thank You!!</text>< username>

They quoted me $100 higher than other body shops for the paint damage on my car then actually tried to charge me for a written estimate. I've never had someone try to charge me for an estimate before.

Enough said, I went elsewhere.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>This place is as good as it can get. You'd be crazy to go anywhere else - the customer service, pricing, attention to detail reveals a perfectionism that I really appreciated after being rear ended. Most of all, the value for money  I got here was beyond. Stan even thought to soup up a few of my car's parts as he had a dead car that was going to be scrapped, and stripped it of a few things my car needed before it went. He threw in a lot of extras for me. All of his staff knew my name as I walked in, and were smart and pleasant. They pride themselves on efficiency, top of the line service and good communication. top pick</text>< Pictures>

If you're looking for a top quality, honest body shop... this is your spot. I felt extremely welcomed by Shant and his fiance right off the bat. SO refreshing to find a place that won't rip you off just because you're a female.

After getting quotes elsewhere for $1200 to replace a front bumper that had partially come off, Shant took one quick look at it and said it would only cost him a couple hours of labor. I ended up paying close to nothing for him to fix it and picked up my car same day.

I will be recommending this place to all my family and friends in the area. Thank you SO much! This is one of the best customer experiences I've ever had and I wish all of my automotive experiences were this positive!</Review>

< Review>
Asked him for a quote to fix my car. He gave me the quote, we agreed in the work and then never followed through. After I called and asked how it was going he said "they keep sending me the wrong parts!" Two weeks later the work was never done! If you didn't want to do the job you should have just told me! Not a professional way to do business! Never called to follow up!<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>Under New Management. Shant, the new owner did a great job on my Acura TLX. Previously I had a bad experience with a body shop. (My license plate fell off my car, they wiped my windshield with dirty rags with chemicals in them, I had to rent a car for 3 days for a simple repair). Marina West Auto Body and Shant was the opposite! I told him I needed the repair in 1 day and he said OK. The price I was quoted I thought was fair/low. He did a perfect job! My car was done in 1 day. The car was detailed clean. I was very happy with the entire experience!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Time>1412813792589< /Time><Review>I have to say that Marina West Auto Body is a rarity in the world of body shops. Stan (the owner) and his team are professional, friendly, and focused on making sure the customer leaves satisfied.
I've had two separate but equally perfect experiences at this place.
In both instances, I was amazed by their craftsmanship, their detailed work and their customer service is on another level.
Case in point: First I would like to say I am very particular about my Jeep. Two months ago I was in an accident and ended up with a damaged front bumper. I began looking for shops in the area to take my Jeep in for repairs. Of the first 3 shops I looked at in the area they all told me they will replace the front bumper and painted. The last body shop I decided to look at was Marina West Auto Body and I had totally different conversation with Shant one of the team members at Marina West Auto.
Shant is knowledgeable, professional, friendly and honest. After 2 minutes of expecting my bumper on both sides and underneath it he said that this might not be just a simple bumper damage. Since the damage on the bumper was exactly where the front frame rail is located he suggested that the front frame rail could be twisted. After doing quick measures needless to say he was right. The front frame rail was twisted with almost an inch.
His thoroughness and attention to detail of assessing the damage made it easy for me to decide which body shop will repair my car. While my Jeep was in the body shop I had the privilege also to meet with the owner of Marina West Auto Body Stan.
Stan is the most genuine person I have ever met. Honest, friendly, professional and very easy to get along with.
Needless to say the repair was excellent. Stan went above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction.
And two weeks ago when my front fender was side swiped in the parking lot I went back to Stan. As always the repair was excellent and the paint matched up to factory specs.
The distinguishing features of Marina West Auto Body that merit their 5 star rating are honesty, quality of work, fair pricing, accurate estimates of repair time and the willingness to go the extra mile to insure customer satisfaction.
I will definitely go back to Marian West Auto Body and I highly recommend them if you are looking to get your car repaired. So glad that I found them!
Thank you Stan and Team!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2b0a6b128dfdb:0x1ea472d63ed14d85</Gmap_id>< Pictures>

<Time>1524250372623< /Time><Rate>1<//Rate><review>***CAUTION - UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP. THE REVIEWS ON YELP AND HERE ARE MOSTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNERS. THE ABOUT US ON THEIR WEBSITE - WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE???*** I'm just really, really sad about my experience here with Shant. Unfortunately, I took my car here for auto body repairs at his shop is very close to where I live and had such great reviews on yelp. It took him over a month to complete the repairs due to me hitting a concrete column. He did wind up covering a rental car for 3-4 weeks because of how long it took. When I finally picked up the car, I quickly noticed there was an air leak where the car was repaired and neither door now closes well. I took the car back for Shant to fix. I drove the car with one of his employees who told me while in the car he could hear the air leak and then as soon as we were with Shant he was very defensive and told Shant he couldn't hear anything! I was so surprised and I asked Shant if it has to come out of his employees pocket to redo the repair or if Shant will be very hard on him and that's why he cannot admit it. Shant drove with me and admitted he heard the air leak himself and said they would fix it. Another couple days later I picked the car up again and not only is the air leak still there, but neither passenger side door closes well, and there is a continuous zapping noise form the speaker that was NEVER there before. I honestly feel like maybe his employee did something intentional to the speaker because he was upset at having it shown that the repair was not done well. I had my family visit, with my young niece, and we have to constantly have them reopen and re-close (hard) the passenger side doors. So disappointing. Shant says there is nothing he is willing do to make this right and every time I drive the car I want to cry! I spent my hard earned money on the car, and "treated" myself to this car. I do not have a lot of budget. Shant on the other hand hand has 5+ luxury/classic cars (one being a Ferrari) and he refuses to help me out, which might be a few hundred dollars. I wanted to like Shant because he seemed kind but I'm super hurt and disappointed.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>This place is honestly the worst place to take your pet. They killed my sister’s puppy by over medicating him to death. They told her he needed a lot of injections for him to survive. They even guaranteed that he was going to live but they killed him little by little. If you really want your pet to survive please don’t bring it here. It would be the worst mistake and you will honestly regret it. This place doesn’t even deserve one star, it deserves 0 stars. They are also really rude and heartless. They don’t care about your pet they only care about the money they will make by lying and manipulating you. Please don’t dare to bring your pet here, he/she won’t make it out alive.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>On March 20 2021 was at Bellwood Animal Hospital my dog have a broken leg. Recommend surgery $5000. Doesn’t care about pets, but money! The Veterinarian don’t follow COVID-19 safety. Worst clinic ever! We trust to care for our pets but they failed. If you love your fur babies don’t go here. My dog got bad infection and veterinarian was not helping made in to big deal and out control my dog almost lost leg. Good thing we step out and found new hospital.< /Review><time>1617205145760< /time>< Rating>

i walk in without an appointment and they it cost 100 hundred something for a visit without an appointment and $80 with an appointment to me that's really expensive and went to another location in long beach with way better customer service and the visit without an appointment was $38!! now i know why this location has bad reviews and no customers if y'all still want your business to run i suggest you to bring your prices down and work on your customer service!</Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Terrible experience! Took our dog to this place after our dog was attacked by the neighbor's dog.  Doctor opened front door without wearing a mask.  That was the first clue.  My daughter had to ask the assistant to tell the doctor to put on a mask because she did not feel comfortable.   So, the doctor put on a mask vertically.   In this day of Covid, why would a doctor think it's okay to greet clients without a mask?

Before seeing our dog, they charged $129.00.  Then he wanted to charge over $1,900.00 to treat the wound.  For real?  We  left.  I could say more about this place but, why waste my time?  Simply said,  I would not recommend this place.

Took our dog to another facility and the cost was $450.00 for everything.  By the way, the facility I took our dog to did not charge us anything until after our dog was treated.   And, the  staff at VCA was great.  They really care about animals.<//review>< Pics>

I don't care what these humans review say. The Dr and the Crew saved my dog Russel. I would like to say Thank You to him and the nurses. Yea he walks in without a mask who f***en cares. Just know he cares for all our pets. Pricing? nothing in this world is free, if y'all can't afford it then go to petco. Haha. If you love your Pet there's no price to save it's life.<//Text>

Absolutely horrible animal hospital. Please go to a better one, it will be worth the wait at any other hospital. The Vet doc Haridy will over-charge you, insist on additional care (overnight stay) even when it is not necessary, just to get more money from you. Immediately they charge $900 deposit before any care, which they NEVER intend on returning to you. I had to call the police on them to release my dog. They will take advantage of you.<//review>

Life savers! Ignore all the negative reviews you may come across (theyre scary but rest assured) because I can tell you dr.K Haridy helped me very well with my 8 month old pregnant kitten she had wounded both paws on her left side and he kept her overnight I picked her up after 22 hours in his care and she’s back to my happy kitty. While in the waiting room I saw patients who have been coming to dr.Haridy for years and they trust him very well. Financially he will help negotiate and accommodate your price range, depending on the severity of course of the case. Very sweet and understanding he knows what he is doing and I wish I had known of Bellwood a lot sooner, thank you dr. Haridy ! I do recommend coming to Bellwood if you have any pet emergency they are on it to serve and save your furry companion.</Text>

<Review>The worst Vet you could possibly go to. My dog was not feeling well so i took her in for an emergency visit. After arriving i explained i have a normal vet but since it was 8pm they were closed. I told him she seemed to be uncomfortable and was there anything we could do to make her comfortable for the night until her regular Vet opened in the morning. He then told me it was a very serious LIFE OR DEATH situation and how do you recommended I let her stay overnight then comes back with a bill for $2,600 explain to me that this would cover her stay fluids medication and  x-rays. He then explained to me that the food I was giving her was part of the problem so the next day I was shocked when I went in to visit her and he asked me to bring her some of the food that she was already eating from my house. Will let you skip forward two days later no X-rays and no medication had been given. I then asked him if it was life or death why have you not even done xrays. He then said she was ok to take. And even though he did not do the agreed-upon procedures he still charge me full price and refused to reduce it. So I basically paid $2,600 for my dog to stay in a cage in the back and be given IV fluids nothing else he's a rip-off and a crook I would not suggest him to my worst enemy< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I am so disappointed in this place.  DO NOT bring your pets here.  They are a rip off.  The vet talked me into a "kitten package" which was supposed to cover my cat for the 1st year.  I spent $500 and today I went to take my cat in to get some medicine for a flight and was told I would have to pay the $79 fee to have her looked at.  I already paid money up front and was only told today OH that doesn't count for that type of visit.  I was also told over the phone by the receiptionist that it WOULD be counted and so I asked the vet to please waive the fee as we are moving out of state and won't even be here the rest of the 7 months included in my package and he refused to waive the fee EVEN though all he was going to do was take a 1 minute look at my cat and give me a sedative for her flight.  Ridiculous and very unprofessional.  Please keep in mind I give everybody a chance and this is my first yelp review because that is how silly I think this place is.  Also, not very clean.< /Text>

This is a good place for any animal. I love how detail the Doctor is a d the staff. They will listen to what ur animal has and what it needs. And for prices they help you in ranges and is affordable and easy. And the Doctors loves the pets and will take care of them.</review>

Do NOT bring your pets here!!! The worst, rudest, money hungry "veterinarian". After paying 2K on my dog she still was not ok and I had to go somewhere else to have her get another surgery! Thank God she is now better.<//text>

One of the worst experiences of both my family and I's lives. We had two beautifully healthy cats whose lives were tragically changed forever. One was stripped entirely of her life and the other scarred from her own experience. We went in hoping for the best for our kitties and we trusted them. When the doctor held them we trusted him to take care of them and he lied. he not only, mutilated one of our lovely babies body, our small black kitty died over night. With out othecarved like a play thing was taken into several or day, who was other operations to prevent her bleeding.This is the worst place to take your pet too, don't do it. All they care for is cash, the not care.</text>

<Review>This is most absolutely the best Vet hospital. Dr. Khalid Haridy is not only very skilled, but a very compassionate man who legitimately cares for your furry family member. The staff are also very kind and helpful and were able to give me the advice and support I needed when my life-long cat's life was on the line.

I came in for a comparatively simple emergency procedure where my cat had two open wounds on her hind legs, but during that surgery, Dr. Khalid Haridy noticed she had much more life-threatening issues inside of her and he was able to save her life. I will forever be grateful and will definitely return here any time my furry family members need any medical care.</Review>< Pictures>

His after care with her was amazing and I can truly say she has a new friend.  Every time I take her there now she is just super excited to see all the staff and most importantly she always has a kiss waiting for the doctor.

Took my pet here because he ate a small amount of chocolate and I did take another dog here before to induce vomit and was only charged $180.  THERE IS NO SENSE OF URGENCY. Apparently this time it required $300. After my dog didn't throw up the chocolate it required a full hospitalization worth $1000 but he did only charge me 500$ after all that was done they told me I needed to spend an additional $130 for meds after the procedure. I spoke to another Doctor who said this was completely unnecessary to do. To me they give the impression of salesman that prey on your feelings for your animal companion. Won't bring my pet here again, but I do think they can get the job done. I also think everything done is just in case anything happens. Just be prepared to crush your bank.< /Review>

PLEASE do not take you pet there if you do you may get sued by them for something your pet did not do. The pup was not even there at the time they said my pup was and had bitten someone. Luckily I had pictures of my pup at home at the time they said the incident happened. They were suing for over 20k, I was served with paperwork few years later from when they said my pup was there and bit someone. Once my attorney gave them that information and proof, they dropped the lawsuit and had the nerve to still ask if they can get some kind of restitution. WHAT A JOKE, this veterinarian is money hungry. Please be do not take your pets there, unless you want to get sued.  I would not give even one star but you have to in order to post.</text>

<review>This vet is absolutely incredible. He saved Donovan’s life. Donovan was found by my coworkers in a field next to my work and it took me a week to find him and I was finally able to catch him. His injuries were so severe that he needed a leg amputation. I was quoted $5000 at another vet and Dr Haridy was the only vet willing to work with me. He was kind and caring. He worked with me on price because I rescue so many animals. He did the surgery that day and within 2 days Donovan was back home acting like he had 3 legs his whole life. No complications and no infections, no swelling, perfect amputation. I couldn’t have done this without this vet. I HIGHLY recommend him.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dd32c43e2f10d9:0x584b9c9167fbe58c</gmapID></record>

I am extremely grateful to Dr. Haridy and his wonderful staff for their assistance in saving my kitty's leg. I was quoted exorbitant sums at every other vet I turned to, and only Dr. Haridy was willing to take on the task while working with me on price. Their staff was very friendly, and my experience overall has been wonderful. Cannot thank them enough.<//text>

This was my first time coming here. I did look at the reviews and still came here I took my Pet bull and the vet doctor was on site around 6pm they were the only vet hospital  open. The doctor did explain everything to me about billing but was more concern about my dog and gave her anesthesia right away. I mean the guy did not even know if I had money or not. He explained what step he was going take to fix her and what the cost were. I had to leave her over night .the next day I came my dog was finished with surgery and look so much better not in pain. He known what he is doing.  I looked at the kennel where my dog had to stay for 3 more day due to surgery and it is clean and she has room to move around.
This guy has a bed  in one room and wait for emergency .  one thing for sure we walked threw the bill and. He helped me find dog loan programs . 5 stars< /review>

At first I thought this was animal heaven. I waited for the vet for four hours. Our three cats were eating themselves alive with fleas. When the vet arrived he made some pretty special remarks. Told me and my husband he would send someone to pick up our three cats and would bring them home after treatment. It was a nightmare catching them. The vets office manager came with her son and spent 2-1/2 hours with us trying to catch them to put them in their carriers. We got two and they had to leave. They said to bring the last one in the next morning. The next morning I called to ask what time I should deliver our cat. The vet got on the line and screamed and ranted at me for five minutes. He was infuriated because it took so long to capture the cats. He finally said to bring her in at noon. He didn't keep his word about sending them home. We had to pick them up. He was not in the office when we got there. Please be warned about this vet. In addition I ordered some medication for my cats from Pet meds to have on hand after 3 months from the time he treated them. He refused to submit the required prescription claiming he would lose his license. Said this after he wanted to match the price at Petmeds if I could prove the price I was quoted. Nice guy!  Hope no one who reads this will ever go there.</review>

<Review>Do not come here very bad vet. Very very bad service he gave my puppy a shot for the pain without taking his weight or doing an examination first.Brought my dog for a a minor cut on his paw and the vet said he needed stitch so we left him to do the procedure, to come back to him saying that my dog didn’t make it through the small procedure of stitches. My puppy was fine, very energetic even with the small cut and suddenly after being gone for only an hour he declared my dog deceased. He was very negligent. Couldn’t get his times right saying he was trying to revive for an hour and a half and i was only gone for an hour. Really don’t recommend it to anyone. If anything it should be shut down. If you want your animal to not make it to see another day this is the place to go.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><date>1543654153133< /date>< username>

<Review>Went in to take a look at the place for a possible job. 1. When you walk in it smells like death and old cat. 2. There was a dead or just euthanized dog in the middle of the kennels not even covered ! (It was definitely someones dog just put down). 3. The vet worse sandals! I wanted to puke 4. Than from the beginning he was extremely rude and could not understand him 5. All the surgical tools and instruments as well as all the treatment areas were disgusting and unhealthy. I try to give the benefit of the doubt but I wont even bring my dog here. Out of 7 years in the animal industry I have never seen anything so nasty . I truly hope they get or have a good practice manager hopefully they can make a turn around ! Best of Luck Bellwood< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>They will steal ur pet. Like they did to me. NEVER GO THERE!!!!!<//Review>< Response>
{'time': 1555218100505, 'text': 'Mr. Gomez,\nThank you for taking the time to leave a review of our hospital. That being said, your claim about your dog being stolen is a complete and utter LIE. You came to Bellwood Animal Hospital on April 6th with a dog, Shelby, that was suffering from vaginal bleeding and was virtually comatose, as she was not able to move on her own. After running bloodwork tests and taking radiographs, our doctor explained to you in great detail that Shelby was suffering from a fatal condition affecting her uterus called pyometra (https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/pyometra-in-dogs).\n\nShelby needed surgery in minutes; otherwise she would die. After the detailed explanation of her condition, to the shock of everyone, you told our doctor to euthanize a young, otherwise-heathy dog. Bellwood Animal Hospital’s principles refuse to let a young patient like Shelby to be unjustly put down because of a condition that can be treated. You were presented a waiver surrendering your rights to Shelby, which you signed, relinquishing all rights to Shelby. We have all of this signed paperwork proving that lying in your review.\n\nAfter you surrendered her, Shelby went into immediate surgery to save her young life. The pictures we have of her surgery show just how enlarged and therefore EXTREMELY CRITICAL her surgery was. Bellwood Animal Hospital took on the RESPONSIBILITY for Shelby’s life and FINANCIAL BURDEN of VERY EXPENSIVE SURGERY and post-op critical care that you were refusing her. Shelby was in critical care for 3 days, but thankfully she recovered.\n\nEven though you were not her owner, we politely answered your requests about her condition. Unfortunately, taking the events into consideration, we could not trust you to take care of Shelby, especially after suggesting to have her euthanized. Shelby is now in a loving home with a very loving family who will take care of her responsibly.\n\nAll this being said – Mr. Gomez, you are NO LONGER WELCOME at our hospital for any services; we would suggest you find another animal hospital to ABUSE.\n\n- Dr. Haridy'}</Response>

I thank Dr. Haridy for restoring my cat’s health.
My cat was very sick and in need of immediate medical care.  I walked into Bellwood as a new customer without an appointment. The receptionist explained that Dr. Haridy was on a house call, however she stated that if I was willing to wait, she would call him.
I waited approximately one hour before Dr. Haridy arrived.   Upon his arrival he was not very engaging but ultimately the service that my pet received was well worth the wait!
During past vet visits   my cat had a lot of anxiety, was restless and difficult to handle.  DR. Haridy and his staff  at Bellwood put her at ease and she was not difficult at all.  The cost of the exam was stated and upon completion of the exam Dr. Haridy provided a diagnosis, explained the treatment plan and cost of the treatment.  He also stated that he was willing to work out a payment plan if I could not afford to pay the total amount on the day of the visit.  The cost of the visit was reasonable and I received  a printed statement.
My cat had follow up visits with Dr. Haridy that went well and resulted in her being a healthy  cat with a happy owner!  Unfortunately, I could not keep Dr. Haridy as a veterinarian because he does not participate with my pet’s plan, United Pet Care (UPC).</Text>

I hadn't read the reviews before taking my dog in last night.  Bellwood was the only facility open and I had no choice.  My 14yo poodle was ill and needed attention.
The staff and Dr. Haridy were kind and professional.  After doing lab work, it was determined that my furbaby was in kidney failure.  Dr. Haridy suggested treatment, but that she was in too bad of shape.  He said he could keep her in the hospital and treat her (and spend thousands treat to her), but that she wouldn't be completely healed.  He did advise putting her down, but gave me options and reality.
Dr. Haridy DID NOT try to overcharge me and take advantage of our situation.  He consoled my daughter and allowed us time with our baby.  He was gentle and caring and so was his receptionist.
Thank you Dr. Haridy for helping a family during this time.</Text>

I took my dog on a Sunday night due to heavy breathing. She was seen immedItaly after my dog was  examed he let me know what kind of treatment she needed to figure out what was wrong with her. Such as X-rays and blood work. I was informed it would cost about $567 and I needed to pay up front or sign up for care credit. So I paid, then I was informed test came back with an pulmonary infection of somesort. My dog needed oxygen and injected antibiotics along with steroids for pain. Another $467. So I paid, the vet was very thoughtful they worked with me as far keeping the cost as low as possible and really give my dog what is needed. She needed to be hospitalized but he stabilized her so I can take her home and then bring her back early morning to continue her breathing treatment . Story short, they saved my dog because she was in bad conditions and help me to keep cost low. Once I picked her up I did have to pay another $60 for meds to take home with me but they gave me free special dog food to help my dogs health condition. I was happy.
What needs to improve. There is only one vet which makes him very busy and hard for him to follow up on the patient. Because they say you would get follow up calls to check on the dog but never got one. Not even when my dog was left the whole day at their office. I constantly had to call the office to check up on my dog health status. However, once I spoke with them they text me pictures of her. Thereafter, vet kept telling me she needed to be fixed, one of my least of my concerns at the moment. My dog is 15months.  Overall, service was good.</text>

<review>PLEASE, IF YOU LOVE YOUR PET, NEVER EVER BRING IT TO THIS CLINIC I HAD A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. DR. IS EXTREMELY RUDE, DISHONEST, N MONEY HUNGRY. THE WELLNESS OF ANIMALS IS NOT A PRIORITY TO HIM, BUT THE MONEY IS. I BROUGHT MY KITTEN TO THIS CLINIC, SHE WAS SUFFERING FRM A "BELLY DISCOMFORT". I SAT IN CLINIC FOR 3HRS. WAITING FOR DR. TO ARRIVE. I WAS TOLD, THE CONSULTATION WOULD BE FREE, DO TO THE LONG WAIT. (LIES)! HE ENDED UP CHARGING ME FOR THE CONSULTATION $59, PLUS $380 FOR X-RAYS. MIND YOU ,WHEN I BROUGHT THE KITTY IN, SHE WAS ABLE TO HOLD HER SELF UP WHEN WALKING AND SHE OPEN UP N CLOSE HER EYES, SHE WAS NOT IN CRITICAL CONDITION AT ALL. DR. DECIDED TO KEEP HER OVERNIGHT TO MAKE SURE MEDICATION WAS WORKING PROPERLY. I PAYED ANOTHER $500. THE NEXT MORNING I COME BK TO PICK HER UP AS I WAS TOLD TO DO SO. N ONE OF THE NURSES TOLD ME I HAD TO WAIT FOR THE DR. HE NEEDS TO TALK WITH ME. I ASKED TO SEE MY KITTY. I WILL NEVER FORGET HOW I FOUND HER 😱 LAYING IN A CAGE  NOT RESPONDING, HER EYES WIDE OPEN, SHE WOULDN'T BLINK AT ALL. YET STILL BREATHING.I PANICKED, I ASK WHAT WAS WRONG. THE NURSE TOLD ME SHE HAD BATHE HER EARLIER N HAD TO "GAS HER" BC SHE WOULD'T SIT STILL. IDK KNOW WHY SHE WUD GIVE HER A BATH?? AT THIS POINT IM 😢 THINKING THE WORSE. NURSE TELLING ME EVERYTHING WAS FINE WITH THE  KITTY ,TO COME BACK IN A COUPLE OF HRS. WHEN DR WAS IN. SO I DID.HE HAD ME WAITING 15min BEFORE HE TALKED TO ME. HE THEN TELLS ME THE KITTY HAD HER "KIDNEY DAMAGED"(WAIT 😱WHAT!)THIS IS CRAZY HOW CAN THAT BE! SHES ONLY A COUPLE OF MTHS OLD! AND NEVER GAVE A SIGN OF BEING IN SUCH CRITICAL STATE.SOON EVERYTHING TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE. HE WAS ASKING FOR $1000 MORE TO MAINTAIN HER UNDER MEDICATION. I WAS NOT EXPECTING THIS, WHY DID HE NOT TELL ME FROM THE GET GO HOW ILL MY PET WAS.I WUD HAVE RUSHED HER 2 ER I TOLD'EM I DID NOT HAVE THE AMOUNT HE WAS ASKING FOR. AT THIS POINT HE TELLS ME TO EITHER HAVE THE MONEY OR HE WUD FORCEFULLY PUT HER DOWN! I WAS DEVASTATED.😭 I FINALLY PAY HIM THE $1000. EVERYTIME I ASKED FOR UPDATES, NURSES  HAD NO INFO.SUCH A COLD FEELING THIS ALL WAS FOR ME.
DR. HAD MY KITTY SEDATED THE WHOLE TIME! 😔HE WAS ONLY TRYING TO MAKE ME THINK SOMETHING WAS REALLY WRONG WITH HER TO MAKE A QUICK COIN! HE WOULDN'T LET ME TRANSFER  MY PET TO A LOCAL ANIMAL HOSPITAL UNLESS I GAVE HIM ANOTHER $1000 😱 I WENT HOME DEVASTATED ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION. I COULD NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT WAS SUDDENLY HAPPENING . I LATER RECEIVED A CALL INFORMING ME THAT MY KITTY DID NOT MAKE IT!😭 I RUSHED OVER TO THE CLINIC, SHE WAS ALREADY COLD😢! HE ASKED ME FOR $500 TO LET ME TAKE HER, I REFUSED TO PAY HIM ANOTHER DIME,  I TOOK MY BABY IN MY ARMS AND AS I WAS HEADING OUT HE SOON LOCKED ME INSIDE THE OFFICE I HAD TO CALL THE COPS ON HIM, HE WAS ARRESTED BUT LATER RELEASED... OFFICER HAD ME PAY THE MAN $500 IN ORDER 2 TAKE MY 🐱😭😭😭
SO UNPROFESSIONAL I SHUD HAVE KNOWN FRM THE MOMENT I SAW THIS DR. HE GAVE ME A BAD EMPRESSION, BAD ATTITUDE HE DID NOT LOOK CLEAN, HE WORE THE SAME CLOTHES TWICE IN A ROW, NAPY HAIR... I'AM SO REGRETFUL AND SORRY TO HAVE BROUGHT MY PET WITH THIS HEARTLESS MAN. HE SAT IN A CHAIR WITH BOTH HANDS RESTING ON THE BK OF HIS HEAD N TOLD ME HE WAS SORRY ABOUT MY "CAT" THAT HE HAD DECLARED HER BRAIN DEAD, N PUT HER DOWN. MIND U HE ACTED WITHOUT MY APPROVAL OR MY KNOWLEDGE. I IMMEDIATELY BROKE DOWN, HE SAID TO ME "ITS OK, YOU CAN BUY YOURSELF ANOTHER CAT" 😱😳😭 I DONT UNDERSTAND, MY BABY WAS WALKING ON HER OWN. THIS WASN'T SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN 2 MY POOR KITTY. PEOPLE ARE ADVISING ME TO SUE HIM...BUT THAT WONT BRING MY KITTY BACK N DONT HAVE THE ENERGY TO DO SO, I MISS MY BABY SO MUCH 😭 I GUESS I WILL LEAVE THIS SITUATION IN THE HANDS OF THE LORD.HE CAN DEAL WITH THIS EVIL MAN FOR ME...
Rest In Kitty 🐱Heaven My Precious Baby...

< Review>
I love Jcpenney, they always have great deals for the whole family. Their customer service is great, the staff is very friendly and always tries to give you the best discount. I recently purchased some beautiful blouses and very comfortable pillows and saved big with their Family13 coupon. Definitely visit the store or purchase online.<//Review>

<Review>I'm hoping their Saturday  hours are only temporary during the virus thing. Because opening at 11:00 is ridiculous.  Some of us who don't get to work remotely still have lots to do on the weekend, (meaning that for me, it's almost and hour and a half drive to work one way, so there's extra time taken up). Because of that, I need to be more of an early bird than willing, and by the time this store opens, half the errands are done. I tried to combine going there along with some other stops in the general area a few times, but it hasn't worked out. Anyway, other than that, they are great and I don't want them to close altogether, we've lost enough department stores in the last few years.<//Review><rate>3<//rate>< Response>

<text>Horrible!!! I was supposed to have curbside pick up and it didn't happen.  They said they couldn't do it at this time.  Apparently everyone waiting for curbside had the same issue.  Why offer curbside pick up if you are not utilizing it?? Bad customer service!< /text>< Gmap_id>

Was not happy with the curbside pick up. I arrived, used the app to let them know I was there. Then 5 mins go by still waiting. Then on the app says "Sorry, for the delay, we'll be there soon. Now 10 mins go by.. Another car pulls in for pick up..  I'm now at 15 mins.. The guy comes with packages for the other car.. I'm like what's going on..?? I tell him I've been waiting 15 mins and no one has brought my order. He says let me go check.. Another car pulls up.. few mins later the guy comes with my order and the car next to me order that just pulled up. 20 mins at curbside for 1 item.. terrible service.. they weren't busy with curbside either.. there were 3 cars mine included.. I was the only car there for 10 mins before the next car came.. ughh</Review>

My biggest concern is COVID guidelines are not being followed. They only have 1 register open on 2nd and 3rd floor. There must have been  30 or more people waiting in line to pay at the 3rd floor checkout. I complained along with another customer and the managers on duty had no answer for the problem. One managers response was I don't make the schedule. Another manager said the other checkouts didn't have protective coverage at the registers. It's been 9 months how can you not have your store setup for shoppers.
Very disappointing.< /Review>

<Text>There weren't enough sales people and I remember when they had good quality clothes for reasonable prices, but we were in the men's department and we couldn't find any men's shirts that didn't feel crispy, and harsh against your skin! The prices were way out of line with the poor quality of the cloth used to make the shirts and pants...there was a sale going on but nothing was worth the price but one pair of pants! I was so sad to see the quality deteriorate so much... trying to find a better store to shop for decent clothes!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

PCPenny has stepped it up! If it's been a while since you've shopped at one... You should check this place out once again!

Not only is the remodel very stylish,  the young woman's fashion is as classy and modern as ever.

We walk past the portrait center and noticed they're still drawing a crowd.
They're doing something right.

Plus,  the photographer happened to come out and he looked like he really enjoyed his job.

I'm not sure if the photo does justice... But I freakin LOVE the color of these shoes!

JCPenny has always been a favorite of mine.< /Text>

I have not shopped at JCPenney in more than 15 years. I got a gift card 5 1/2 years ago, now that I have used the card, there is absolutely no need to go back. Way to expensive and I even looked at the final clearance section. I bought Levi's pants at $60.00. 40% off the second pair. That's how they get you. Variety of items were not for me and it was difficult to get my size for the pants. Every other store I shop at has my size though. When we first walked in the store the first woman at the counter was rude. Will never walk into a JCPenney again.< /text>

As "the store in the middle" if the mall,  it's definitely the easiest big store to visit.
Lots of quality merchandise (mostly clothing, though other things) in this store & frequently more sales than many of the other mall stores.
With other big stores going out of business, hopefully this will be one of the good big ones that remain.< /Text>

I went not to long ago to get some shoes. I was looking at where some of the vans were at. All the vans there were fake. I know this for a fact because I was wearing my slip-on checkered vans and I saw that they had the same ones there. I looked closely at the shoe ands there was a lot of obvious details.</text>

I did a quick walk through and as soon as i walked through the store, it felt so cluttered. All the racks were not giving enough space to walk through. It felt messy without it being messy. But also looked for a suit vest and did not find one. Was only in there for less than 5 minutes.< /Text>

<Review>I needed a new pair of dress shoes, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. I don't wear dress shoes that much and my last pair lasted about 10 or so years.
They were having a great sale and bought a pair of really nice shoes for about 50% off.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

JCPenney as with every retailer is struggling to compete with Amazon. We do a lot of shopping online with JCPenney and use the store to pick up our orders. The store is clean and the staff is helpful. The only problem is sometimes staff is hard to find. One advantage they have is they have specialty sizes. Also, for those items you just have to see or touch before you buy they have good variety.< /Text>

<review>This JCP overall is pretty good. I've never encountered a rude employee, everyone seems to be on the same page with service.  I didn't give it 5 stars because sometimes they are understaffed so that can be a bit frustrating when you need help or you're waiting in long lines.<//review><username>Lety Chairez</username><gmapID>0x80c29b0cbc465ad5:0xd177ad9acf5e6846< /gmapID>< response>

<text>Love the online deals - got 3 pair of boots for $60+ tax! The online pickup on the order hand is a pain in the a$$. You'll have to go inside the mall into pennies and then to the 3rd floor where the kitchen gadgets are. There's always a line there with only one person at the counter helping. I wish they have online pickup similar to Sears where you can just pickup at their receiving dock and not having to go inside the mall.</text>< resp>

<review>This J. C. Penny's has permanently closed the men's fitting room by the jeans. Now a customer needs to walk to the fitting room with his items located all the way on the other side of the store. Better load up your arms with trousers, fellows, or plan to make three or four trips back and forth. Once you get to the other fitting room, you will find it poorly lit, dirty, and some rooms don't have chairs. And, that's the way it's been for a long time.< /review>< pictures>

What's not to love about JCPenney the buyer for JCPenney knows quality you can buy Nice Clothing in several price ranges and even their lowest price range you're getting good quality they have all styles  and colors Galore their Fashions go from Ultra Modern to country gal, New York style to La's best beach wear, men's clothing you can find it at JCPenneys for a good price. They have all sizes from very petite, short, thin,curvy,  the plus-size is climb way up to plus, plus  and their style and fashion for the lovely larger ladies won't be disappointed from business to casual wear to sexy lingerie they have it all at JCPenney .No, I don't work for them my closet is filled with lovely Fashions from JCPenney.<//text>

The JC in JCPenney stands for Jesus Christ a popular guy who would turn pennies into prayers, & prayers into home furnishings, with a great selection of name brand men's & women's juniors & miss young men's clothes at wholesale prices. At JCPenney you save more than just a few bucks.< /Text>

<review>Oh boy. Yeah this place is a dinosaur. It’s barely hanging on in a day of Amazon and online shopping. Items packed all over the place, so many discount signs. It’s like Kohl’s. “How much is stuff really”? This store in part has a sense of being in the past. How fun is it to stand in line FOREVER and then be asked if you want to save an additional 3,000% today by opening a credit card at 28.9% interest.

Employees do work hard and this review is a reflection of this store and not the hard working people that work here.< /review><userid>100918359359816244291<//userid>< rate>

This store has gone WAY downhill.  One checkstand with one clerk open on the bottom floor.  No help on the sales floor and the displays look like a tornado hit them.  The management at this store obviously has no pride in their store.</text>

<Time>1561522236486</Time><text>I have shopped at JCP for several years now and I have to say, it looks like they are struggling. Not enough staff at the cash register or on the floor, it's so difficult to find help. I just went last week and staff looked over whelmed, clothes don't look appealing in the kids department, clothes are scattered every where and very difficult to figure out the discount off the clothes. Going shopping at JCP felt more like work, not the experience the consumer should ever feel. JCP, you have to change your strategy. I'm a disappointed long term consumer...<//text></record>

Hey they have clearance items to get rid of the past season clothes. I would recommend for the clothes on the clearance racks to be picked up. Customers throw things around.<//Review>

<review>Find a great deal but you will need to wait forever to make the purchase. 4 cashier stations with over 10 customers waiting only have 1 or 2 cashiers. Time is more valuable than any sale JCPenney can offer.< /review></record>

<Text>Over the past few years, I have entrusted my eyes vision' s examinations and prescription glasses to JCPenney.  Although I ve tried other large store' s vision center couple of times, however, JCPenney' s optical department at Northridge Fashion Center always win me over with an excellent customer care.  The optical department is located at JCPenney' s top floor/near photos department, I typically skip the mall, park on the top level with a direct access to JCPenney / Optical department ..  Optica Manager " IRINA BOVAN" is wonderful, very knowledgeable, patient and extremely helpful.  No hard pressure or scripted sales promotion, just an honest approach to helping customers.  While other on-lines optical services may offer some saving, but an On-Line optical service will not be able to offer the excellent customer care that you will experience here.   Further, if you are fortunate enough, " IRINA BOVAN" will likely offer you a great promotion to help make you purchase more economical.  In may case, she was kind enough to save my contact information for several weeks, then she contacted me as was able to find a great coupon to compliment my two pair of glasses with a pair of bi-focal for my mom to update her older glasses.. Many Thanks IRINA !< /Text>< pictures>

The store looked completly diffrent from what it was years ago. The wide collection we use to see here was gone. Now you see much smaller collection. Shopping here is not fun as it used to be before. I am not sure if I want to come back for shopping. We miss you JCPenney.</review>

This location is always very busy. But they never seem to have enough registers open. The lines are always 6-8 people waiting. I try to avoid this location because of this.</text>

Wish I could give zero stars. Went to pickup my online order, was in a long line. They have same line for pickup, returns and checkouts-what a mess..after going through that ,they said they don’t have my order. Rather than providing options to resolve the issue, they washed their hands and said they don’t know what happened to my order.Store manager Alma was rude and didn’t know how to respond to such cases. Wasn’t apologetic at all, in fact, was treating me as if it was my fault . What a waste of my Saturday hour  ! Never Jcpenny again.<//Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>Made the mistake of visiting during the Christmas rush. It was an absolute madhouse with less stretching seemingly forever. Stock was scattered everywhere and many items did not even have price tags. Nobody was available to even answer a simple question. Again, this may not be a fair assessment as it occurred during the holiday rush, but I expect more of a store such as this.<//review>< pictures>

I went to the store today, spent more than an hour to fine same thing that I want. waited more than 15 minutes just to the cashier to show me that the coupon that I want to use is for next week.the date is written in small words, and the coupon for this week it's says 25 precent but I am not using jcp card so it is only 15 precent. I left everything in store and decided not to spend time anymore at this store. My suggestion check twice the information on coupon.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>I love great deals but I wish there was another JCPenny in the area. The jewelry department needs to learn to not judge a book by its cover. Everytime I go I am neglected customer service and put to the bottom of the list of being prioritized because I am young and I go in comfortable attire, no makeup, etc. There was one instance where there were three people helping out one customer and not daring to pay attention to me. I know it doesn't help that I'm not necessarily assertive but I would at least like to be acknowledged since I am buying something from THEM. Not too sure if they work hourly wages but they sure do act like they get a percentage of what they sell, which they shouldn't show regardless.<//Text>< user_id>

I walked with my friend Curtis Glassberg and we walked to the Northridge Mall after we left Dave and Buster's then walked to JCPENNEY and browsed around at shoes, t-shirts, Dress shirts, ties, belts, and sport jackets. We were walking looking around and the cashier did good customer service and the Men's bathroom it was cleaned.< /Text>

<review>Team member, Tiffany, at register was very helpful and gave me additional savings. The store overall is a total mess! I shopped in the toy dept of children's apparel. The floor was littered with toys, clothes as was most of the departments. The company needs to employ more personnel and clean up this store. What will the store look like when holiday shopping begins? I shudder to think.  I have been a card member for many years and this is not the store it once was. Those managers/CEO in charge....make changes or you will lose customers.< /review></record>

< review>
I am writing this note of appreciation for the outstanding customer service I received on June 20, 2015, a day before Father's Day. The store personnel were very busy. I had just arrived when a Lady of the name of Azniv, asked if she could help, I told her I was shopping for my husband for a whole new wardrobe, she quickly pointed me in the right direction for the store buster sells. I then started to feel that I had my own personal shopper, or that I had front rolls sits to the Northridge JCP.  She never left my side, and yet managed to answer customer questions in between my major shopping spree. I ended spending over $800.00, I bought for my husband, my brother & my brother in law. Azniv was patient and did not mind going upstairs to look for the colors or sizes that I needed. I will be shopping again next year for Father's Day & I will be looking for Azniv!
Excellent Customer Service! Way to go Azniv.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>(Translated by Google) This store is inside the mall and for that reason anyone would think that everything would have to be in its place, but the truth is that if you are going to buy something take your time because you will have to enter and look for everything is where you want the clothes that are in The tables are not organized, the ones on hooks are hung as you like and on the floor, of course we would think that we are the ones who do it but if you enter when the store will open or moments before closing everything you would find it the same 😕😕and there are not many workers, you have to search almost all over the store for someone to help you with whatever you need 😔😔and cashiers there are always only one or two and the big lines to pay,

(Original)
Esta tienda esta en dentro del mall y por ese echo cualquiera pensaria qe todo tendria qe estar en su lugar,pero la verdad es qe si vas a comprar algo toma tu tiempo porqe tendras qe entrar y buscarlo todo esta donde quiera la ropa qe estan en las mesas no esta organizada,las qe estan en ganchos estan colgados como quiera y asta en el suelo,claro pensariamos qe somos nosotros mismos los qe lo hacemos pero si entras al momento de qe la tienda habre o momentos antes de cerrar todo lo encontrarias igual😕😕y no hay muchos trabajadores tienes qe buscar casi por toda la tienda haber quien te ayuda con lo qe necesites 😔😔y cajeros siempre solo hay uno o dos y las grandes lineas para pagar,<//review>< pics>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The truth is that it is a store that has been open for years, the prices are varied, and the truth of a few years to here I look at that poorly ordered store, I don't know if it is due to lack of staff but if I advise you that if you go, go early Because I'm not sure what they are looking for is in sight😕😕 and apart there are some great lines just to pay ,,,

La verdad qe es una tienda qe a estado habierta por años,los precios son variados,y la verdad de unos años para aca yo miro esa tienda mal ordenada,nose si es por falta de personal pero si les aconsejo qe si van vayan con tiempo porqe no estoy segura de qe lo qe busqen este a la vista😕😕y aparte se hacen unas gran lineas solo para pagar,,,<//Text>< pics>
