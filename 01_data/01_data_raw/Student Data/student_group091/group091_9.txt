<text>This place is a veritable Candy Land of cannabis! I wandered in on a whim to see what my options were in the way of edibles to help with a few months of post-surgery recovery and Cliff was so kind and helpful and hooked me up with some fantastic products! The happy hour discount and first time buyer discount were a completely unexpected and warmly welcomed surprise. I’m truly looking forward to coming back, this place has an incredible selection and great vibes. High fives all around 🙌<//text>< pictures>

<review>The selection here is insane. They have a huge selection of flower, but what I like the most is their variety of different cannabis products. Drinks, edibles, oils, you name it. Personally I love the Kanha gummies. They hit within 15 minutes. Super effective. Incredible.<//review><user>113584061022053802235<//user>< Resp>

Everyone in the store is amazing. I've been in twice and everyone knew what I wanted when I asked. They have a huge selection of what makes Cali the best in the west. I think they call it "Roots" because everyone is down to earth but don't quote me on that. Just go in and see for yourself!<//Review>

Really enjoy doing business here. Friendly staff, clean environment, good inventory, and they offer receipts if you would like to itemize for medical expenses.

I like they offer a happy hour from 6am-10am and again from 2pm-6pm, rotating vendors with special deals and comps; and at times a discount table. Bring your own zipper bags from previous visits to save a new bag and a buck.

I'd recommend this place for the receipts alone, but overall for being upbeat with a positive vibe. Definitely one of my favorites!</Review>

The customer service in itself is amazing! So much inventory to choose from. I needed a little help picking and choosing the product I needed thus, being my first time, I received the attention and help. So much knowledge of each product was known and that is great. Great service if you ask me. I greatly appreciate the time and patience that was dedicated to listen to my needs. I want to thank Roots LA for great service and product.</text>

<Text>Came here for my first and last time for the reason that I happened to be in the area for an interview so I decided to stop by. Only had I known I’d regret it I’d never showed up. The atm machine is very confusing I made numerous attempts to with draw cash but somehow it wasn’t giving the option of the amount I would like to withdraw it just gave the option of checking or saving I pressed checking and from there it asked the option for a receipt that’s where it got confusing bc it skipped the part of giving me the option of the amount I wanted to withdraw so I tried again and again again and each time all I received was a receipt until finally after all the attempts I was now able to withdraw $40 plus I believe $1.95 for the fee I confirmed ok not a problem however later Threw my online banking I seen I was charged $2.50 three times at a total of $7.25 from the use of there atm machine excluding the additional fee on top of that when finally I was able to get cash out so all along I was getting the printed receipt without any cash withdrawal and got charged! I’m only sharing my experience so maybe u could save yourself the trouble and avoid useing  there atm machines just go with cash when u arrive</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Please call us at Roots 818 210 0095 and ask for one of the managers and we'll work with you to fix the potential issue. Our 2 ATM machines have on average 120-130 transactions daily and this is a first I'm hearing about a person being charged 3 x.  Like you mentioned our ATM charged you once (the ATM charges $1.95, typically Banks charge $2.5 - $3.00. I believe your bank charged you 3x the $2.50. Even with that said Call us and we will help off balance that we got you because we understand and we've been in your shoes in the past and I'm certain one of us at Roots will be in your shoes in the future. We got you here at Roots Los Angeles in the near future, I'm sure you got the job ;) cheers have a great start to your Monday!"}< /Response>

<text>Employees have always been great. The "store manager" that I met today, Isha, made me change my view of this store.

I was early for happy hour by 10 minutes and the employee was attempting to help me resolve the issue of missing the discount.

Isha approached and seemed agitated about the situation. She verbally reprimanded the employee....and me in front of customers about the no refund policy that the employee asked ME if he could fix!

Embarrassed for myself and the employee, I just left. I'll take Roots off the GoTo list.

Maybe you should handle the customer first, then reinforce store policy with employees away from paying customers.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><UserId.>111076420234739647897<//UserId.>< Response>

The ultimate experience yesterday! Our wait party of 5 with a reservation was one hour long. If your going to charge for NOT showing up PLEASE be punctual on your "reservations". Besides that the food was ok, definitely can add more items on the menu. Our budtender was great, our food waitress not so good. She seemed a little annoyed and rude. Her name was Amber</Review>

I assure you we put our staff through customer service training and secondly some sales training and I can say a good 30-40% of our staff has had starbucks experience some time in their past so they have solid customer service background.  I hope you give us a second chance Nancy in the near future because I believe on an aggregate level we have amazing budtenders who are very knowledgeable, helpful, positive, very professional, respectful, and energetic who genuinely are great people.

None of our reviews are by friends or family (I'm one of the partners here and a google analytics expert before every going into this industry, if we did that google would pick up on that as would yelp which is owned by google and we would be penalized greatly) .\n\nYes our taxes are separate from the price of the product and we tell all our new customers that when checking them in.  We also Disclose it on our weedmaps and our leafly which are linked to you below so I don't know where you are coming from in regards to us not having a weedmaps page and leafly. We also have a website www.RootsLosAngeles.com. I hope you know the Taxes we are charging are not from thin air they are what we have to pay the state and city and such. You must do more research because when another dispensary charges you 15% or lets say 20% taxes the remaining costs are in the price of the product. Same thing, but we still beat the overall price we are VERY COMPETATIVE trust me.\n\nIf you wanted to put us down that's one thing but you lose credibility when you make a plug for two other stores one of which is a storefront and the other is a delivery company it seems like.\nhttps://www.leafly.com/dispensary-info/roots-dispensary        https://weedmaps.com/dispensaries/kush-korner-35c03952-24fb-4ac9-a879-c52b0f87351d"}</Resp><text>They do not incorporate taxes into the cost. For $130 I got 7 janky grams of less than 20% THC strains. The subtotal was $97, meaning they are upcharging 30% tax on you. No other place in the valley is this expensive, and it's rather telling that some of these reviews look like friends, employees, or paid for. Don't bother. Muzeum LA is really where it's at. Only 7 miles away. Or go with delivery from a trusted place like Emberz. Don't bother with this overpriced retail store. This is what the bad future of marijuana looks like, and it should be avoided.

EDIT: Should be noted this place isn't on weedmaps or leafly, the Roots stores you see there are different, and run by actual growers, not some dude who knows a grower etc. Avoid this type of retail stores that use similar names to grower owned/operated dispensaries. They are generally scamlords who rented a place and aren't even pre-ordinance. This place is definitely one of them. Do not buy from them, you are supporting the downfall of the marijuana industry in California doing so.< /text><name>mister shoe< /name></record>

Edit #2
Seems like management is caring less and less about their customers satisfaction.. when the mistake was on your end you should be going out of your way to make it right, not the other way around.
Shout out to Brenda and Alex. If it wasn't for them this review would have been written in a different tone.

Edit #1 really disappointed today. Service was really terrible. Im an almost every day customer. The guy wearing a ninja turtle mask needs to loosen up on the tude dude<//text>

Super Dope place they always have what my brother needs and my mom loves the CBD products here because she has nerve pain sometimes so it's not to find products that help her with that!<//review>

<Review>Clean, new and professional. The staff is friendly and I was surprised at how much of the medicinal products they have. Much more than any other dispensary I've seen. Lots of CBD stuff. The prices are decent too. It's up on DSherman Way but totally worth the trip. And they have 15% off everything  on certain days of the week.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2953e6decbaa7:0xd87e916ded2283a1<//gmapID>< user>

< Review>
Gold Coast is by far the best chiropractic center ever. Everyone is so friendly, and super informative. I enjoy going to my appointments and I feel so much better leaving too. Lorraine worked on me after my car accident and now Dr. Dave currently works on me. They both worked together to figure out what I needed in my adjustments to get me where I’m at now with no more constant pain. They are very thorough making me feel the most comfortable. Also Emily is the best! She is so great at scheduling and really works with my crazy schedule.< /Review>

Talkk about a pain in the neck!!
I am 54 and been surfing over 40 years.
This past winter the pain in my neck and back was so severe I literally couldn’t surf!
I  decided to “kick down” and get help…yes treatment costs $$ but I am so glad I did.
Dr. Dave and his team are amazing.
With X-rays and a lengthy consultation, he educated me on my issues and mapped out a quick and reasonable road to recovery.
His plan worked and I am back in the water!
Do I still visit Gold Coast, yes!
I saw Dr. Dave today as he’s “tuning” me up for my surf trip to El Salvador next month!!!!< /Text>

I'm so happy I came across Dr. Jacob Melendez. I woke up one morning with trouble breathing. The front desk assisted me in making an appointment that same day, and after a thorough examination of my medical and personal history along with anthropometric assessments and x-rays efficiently examined, Dr. Melendez was able to perform the perfect adjustments to relieve my pain along with explaining exactly what was occurring with my back and possible future consequences.

The whole practice amazed me. Everyone was especially friendly and answered any questions or concerns I had. There's also just something about being in a family practice that helps reach and optimal level of comfort and trust.<//Text>

I absolutely love Gold Coast Chiropractic !! I’m 6 months pregnant & have been having aches and pains. I was really nervous to come at first , just because I’ve never had an adjustment done while pregnant  , but the office staff and Doctors have all been so amazing !! They walked me through ever step and made sure I was comfortable at all times.  After my first adjustment I felt so good ! Dr. Lorraine and Dr. Anna are so sweet and very attentive. I definitely regret not coming sooner!! I bought a 12 session package and can’t wait to go in and get adjusted again ! My new favorite place !</Text>

My experience with Gold Coast has been absolutely nothing but wonderful. The doctors who have taken care of me (Especially Dr. Jacob Melendez) are friendly, clearly knowledge in their craft, and provide me with treatment fully personalized to helping me. The Gold Coast family views what they do as trying to help people to fully recover from injuries, or just stay healthy by addressing every piece of a patients lifestyle from physical conditioning and spinal adjustments to day to day changes. The experience even comes with a view.</Review>

You will not find better chiropractors! Drs. Melendez provide an incredible experience in office, while additionally educating and empowering you to make steps towards a healthier life in your daily routine after you leave office. The entire Gold Coast staff are friendly, helpful and make each appointment a joy!<//Review>

<text>They have mastered a process that can actually help people get better. They take X-rays and evaluate you status and progress and make it very personal. They don’t rush in and try to apply a one fit to all. They really custom tailor their process to your need so that they can help You. That is my experience so far.</text><rate>5< /rate>< userid>

<text>I have been to MANY chiropractors in my lifetime, and this is BY FAR the best chiropractor I have ever been to in my life. He has literally changed so many lives, including many of my family members. Don't trust just any chiropractor.. it can be very risky. if you want the absolute best and care about your spine, GO HERE, I promise you will not be let down.< /text><rate>5<//rate>< user_id>

I’ve had a messed up neck for the past 3 weeks prompting a visit today. Dr. David gave me the best adjustment I’ve probably ever had instantly taking away the pain and headache I was suffering through. Gold Coast has been a huge blessing to our family for years! 100% would recommend any of their doctors without hesitation, they are pro’s!<//review>

Thank you Dr. Anna, Grace, David and Emily, you all were professional, happy, informative and nice people. I felt taken care of just wish my visit would have included adjustments and my results for the $49 fee I found on Facebook. Otherwise I liked the office, it was clean and Covid ready. Everyone who left seemed very happy. If I am as pleased tomorrow as I was today, I will be bringing my daughter and the rest of my friends and family. Well done guys.< /text>

I had an intake with Dr. Anna today and she was very personable, engaged in getting to know me/my care needs and provided such a great overview of the clinic and services - along with the "why" behind them. Thank you!<//review>

This was my first experience with a Chiropractor and I 100% recommend. Dr. Anna is EXTREMELY knowledgeable and client centered. She explained the entire process and any terms I didn’t understand to me. She made sure I was educated on each step as it occurred, which I appreciated very much. It wasn’t intimidating asking questions at all. The office environment is super friendly and they make sure you’re comfortable and your body is ready before adjustments. I feel so much better knowing what was causing my backaches and headaches! I highly recommend stopping for a visit and consultation, you won’t regret it at all!< /Review>

Best decision I made all year was coming here to correct my back issues. Dr Jacob has gone above and beyond addressing my concerns throughout the process of correction. The whole staff is friendly, very open environment!< /text>

We love all of them at Gold Coast! I cant thank them enough for the restored health they brought to me and my whole family. We consider them an extension to our family and are so very thankful for them. Dr Lorraine took my body from constant pain to complete healing and restoration. She helped my daughter restore her balance and confidence, her adjustments not only healed her physically but emotionally and mentally. We make an hour drive to get adjusted and it is completely worth it!< /review>

<Review>Chiropractic treatment in this practice is more like becoming a member of a total wellness family.  The atmosphere is welcoming and comfortable. The expertise and professionalism are excellent. They are thorough and genuinely care about your wellbeing.  I am the one of 5 members of our family to come under their care and highly recommend them to anyone who is in need. Our family ranges in age from  birth to 56 and we all love them!

I have worked with them through critical care, transition care and am currently in lifestyle maintenance. I feel so much better physically! I also feel far more equipped to take better care of myself for the long run. Come join us!< /Review><rating>5</rating>< gmap_id>

Dr.s Melendez are hands down the best! A crew of magical elves merrily tinkering away on stiff bodies, they are always cheerful, thorough, and caring. The most fantastic chiro I have ever received! They gave me my life back after a car accident 2 yrs ago. A great family place with lovely ocean views, friendly prices, and pleasant music too. Highly recommend!!!<//text>

Love Gold Coast Chiropractic! After every visit I leave refreshed. They work hard at what they do and you can tell they care about you. Even amongst COVID, they continue to work hard, serve you, and take care of your needs while following all the guidelines put out by the CDC. As a former football player (10 years of playing) I am thankful for all the healing that has come from seeing Dr. Dave and Dr. Jacob. They are helping me heal and feel healthy again!<//review>

This place is Amazing. Everything you need in 1 place. Exam, X-rays, Therapy room.
I was so happy with my first appointment that I brought my husband in the following week. I have been working with Dr. Lorraine and my husband is not working with Dr. Dave. They even have a play room for kids to stay in while their parents are getting their treatment. Beautiful pictures of their clients all over.. some of the best equipment I’ve ever worked with.
I am so happy to have found them and every single person in that office has been amazing!
Thank you Gold Coast!!!!< /Review>

<review>I really enjoy going to Dr. Lorraine for adjustments.  She has a great touch and employs some unique techniques and modalities that I haven't experienced with other chiropractors.  I especially appreciate how each of the Drs. Melendez has his or her own little specialty, so chances are you'll get to know each of the doctors!  Every staff member at Gold Coast Chiropractic is not just friendly, but genuinely cares for your long-term health.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

<Text>Gold Coast is as good as it gets.  From the moment I walked in for my first visit, it has been such a smooth and rewarding process.  They treat you like family.  Each doctor gets to know you and truly cares about how you are doing on the journey back to health.  Your body was made to be healthy, but sometimes we need a little help to get back to health.  Dr. Dave Melendez has given me that help that my neck and back needed to feel normal again.  I am 39 and have had chronic neck stiffness and pain since I was 19.  For the first time in 20 years, I feel close to normal again.  They have an amazing philosophy that includes a great warm-up, excellent adjustments, and a rejuvenating post adjustment process as well.  They include home care advice as well.   I cannot say enough about the Melendez family and my experience at Gold Coast.  Amazing people who are at the top of their game.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Gold Coast Chiropractic has a great system for correcting the root cause of what ails you.  Not just a quick fix establishment.  I’ve been seeing chiropractors since I was 12 so 40 years now and I’ve seen it all with chiropractic and Gold Coast is like none I’ve ever been to as far as their approach.  Dr. Anna took a before x-ray of my back, placed me on their unique SRT table then performed some light adjustments.  The after X-ray show’d my spine already correcting after one visit.   They have other machines and methods I have never seen before.  Super progressive place!  Each visit in a series brings you to a corrected state with long term benefits not just a temporary fix.  That’s what differentiates them from other back-crackers.  I’m so happy to have had this experience with them!  Highly recommend Dr. Anna at Gold Coast!< /text>

If you’re looking for a family run local Chiropracter office that gives excellent care then Gold Coast Chiro is the place for you! I have been working with Dr Anna for the past few months and she is fantastic. She is gentle, knowledgeable and always explains what she is doing, which is great for someone like myself who was nervous of getting adjusted! My migraines have significantly improved since seeing Dr Anna and I would highly recommend her!</review>

I didn't grow up with chiropractic care, so I was a little nervous going in for the first time. During my first visit a few months ago, Dr. Anna did an amazing job explaining every step from the initial consult through first appointment. She made sure I was comfortable and understood the benefits based on my specific needs and the science behind chiropractic before my first adjustment. The office is convenient to get to (both off the highway and within Encinitas), and you get the benefit of supporting a family-owned local business. Highly recommend Dr. Anna :)<//Review>

I have been going to Gold Coast Chiropractic for a few years now. All the Dr.'s Melendez are so knowledgable and really take the time to sit down with you and help meet your health and chiropractic needs. Have nothing but the best to say about their practice. The office is located in Cardiff a quick drive off the freeway right off Highway 1. Very relaxing office environment when you're there and the entire staff is so helpful, friendly and inviting. Would definitely recommend them.<//Review>

<review>Dr. Anna and her team have made a new experience an easy adjustment (pun unintended). I am in my second pregnancy and going to a chiropractor this time around has lessened so much of the discomfort. It doesn't matter how small the discomfort may be, Dr. Anna listens patiently and you feel heard as she asks you more pointed questions and how you may be feeling in other areas as well. After a handful of visits, we opted to have my two year old be evaluated as well. After one visit, he is sleeping better and his digestive issues (what we were concerned about) have been clearing. Thankful that the team of doctors here help you create a plan so that way you don't feel like you are in a sinkhole of visits (even though I now look forward to every adjustment). They genuinely want the best for the patients and seek to help anyway they can. Thank you, Gold Coast Chiropractics!< /review>< user_id>

<text>I have been a patient of Dr. Melendez for over a year. I have been treated by chiropractors my whole life for various issues like headaches, sports injuries, and “performance tuning.”  I have probably seen at least 25 different chiropractors over the years. Based on my experience, I can honestly say that Gold Coast is the best. They have many chiropractors on staff that work together as a team (and family). You can’t go wrong with Gold Coast.< /text>< Pics>

<Pics>None</Pics><text>I recently went to Gold Coast Chiropractic Center. My experience at gold coast was 5 star from start to finish. The office is very modern and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. They even showed me a video on Chiropractic before they took me back for my appointment.

I saw Dr. Jacob. He was excellent and very knowledgeable. He took the time to answer all of my questions and explained everything to me. He was very thorough. I have never had a chiropractic adjustment so I was a little nervous. Dr. Jacob however explained to me exactly what he was going to do and what it was going to feel like before he did anything.

I loved my experience here and I will only be coming to them from now on. I strongly recommend anyone and everyone to give them a shot.

Dr David, Dr Lorraine and the entire family and staff are simply the best! My family and I have been coming here for over 15 years. When I was in a car accident, he's the first doctor I went to before even trying physical therapy or any sort of medications or visiting an orthopedist. I am very active with running and Dr Melendez has taken me in a short time from being almost debilitated by this accident to back up and running 15-20 miles a week. Gold Coast is a god send and I genuinely look forward to each visit! Thank you all 🙏🏼< /Review>

I have been to a lot of different Chiropractors over the years but never any that even come close to the Melendez Doctors. I drive about an hour + each direction because they take the time to listen ,exam, educate me and give me so much relief. They are the only Doctors I trusted with my babies and my grandbabies. What a difference they have made in my family's lives. Now if I could get them to open another office in Temecula 😉<//text>

Dr Jacob and the family are amazing. With a view of the ocean and the customer service it’s easy to give them 5 stars, not to mention their focus on long term spinal correction and not just a “quick fix” mentality. They treat you like you’re part of the family and the practice is run like a well oiled machine. It’s no surprise they’ve been in business for almost 30yrs. Thanks Gold Coast!</Text>

It's a family business and that benefits patients because they'll call over one of the other doctors to help if needed for a specific adjustment. The atmosphere is friendly, professional and they have handled the COVID situation very well.

Dr. Jacob and the Gold Coast team are GOLDEN! I have the pleasure of knowing Dr. Jacob and his family personally. They all share a common goal of overall wellbeing of their clients through combined chiropractic knowledge from generations (third generation and counting), warmth and compassion. I feel these qualities run in their blood and is so evident in their genuine & honest care for their clients. They have not only given back to their local community, but also performed free care in many countries helping thousands of people live pain free and quality lives. I highly recommend Dr. Jacob and the Gold Coast team!<//text>

<Date>1588033515611< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate><text>I will write a more thorough review in the future with more details but the short version is I had an injury of protruding discs impacting my nerves in my spine. I couldn’t walk and was on heavy opiates and bedridden for about a month. I credit Dr. Jacob and Dr. Dave and Marcus and the whole friendly professional team at Gold Coast with helping me lower my pain and walk again. Their work on me plus my physical therapy got me up off the bed and walking in a about 6 weeks from
My first visit. I went from excruciating pain to feeling very close to normal a lot quicker than I expected and quicker than my prognosis indicated when I first injured myself. The thoroughness of having the x-rays plus Jacobs ability to explain my MRI’s and reports from Scripps were extremely helpful. The Dr that took my MRI at the hospital barely explained what was causing my pain and suffering and the team at Gold Coast were able to shed light and explain my entire spine from looking at my MRI’s, the MRI reports and of course the xrays they took. The best and most thorough explanations I have ever experienced with a doctor in my life. I just wish I was as informed when I was in my 20’s as I am now from their educating me on my own body. If I had gone to them sooner I could have saved myself a lot of pain and suffering.  With their help I hope to be 100% and learning to surf after 3-6 more months of treatment and sticking to my physical therapy.  They have helped me on so many levels and my whole family is now taking up all of their time getting their amazing thorough treatment.  I am very grateful. I Highly highly recommend seeing them especially if you can go to see what your spine is up to before you get injured.  But of course I think they were instrumental in helping me heal from
My injury faster than anyone expected.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Dave and crew at Gold Coast Chiropractic are amazing.  Dave helped my husband so much with his back.  He was unable to play golf without pain and now after a few months of working with Dave he can!  And any time I have pain from lugging around our 30 pound ‘toddler’ I go see Dave and feel better so quickly.  I can’t say enough about the results but more or as important is how I feel so at home at their office. Every single person is so welcoming and positive.  Highly recommend Gold Coast!</Text></record>

I can confidently state that no other practices go as in depth with their treatment as the Melendez family at Gold Coast. They start with the x-rays to show you exactly what needs to be corrected as opposed to just stating some made up issues to get more business. They are all AWESOME and so welcoming to their client family!</Review>< UserId.>

Hard to really describe the impact these chiropractors have had on my life. Being in pain is a quality of life issue and by getting me out of pain they have elevated the quality of life. Go and find out.< /text>

A great chiropractor husband & wife team who are passionate about what they do.  They really take the time to listen and target the area in pain.  I can feel confident when I refer potential family/friends to them.  Their office is also in a great location in Cardiff right across the street from Seaside Market, easy to access & the view's not too bad either.<//text>

<text>I absolutely love Gold Coast Chiropractic.  All the Drs are fabulous!  I especially love Dr. Anna!  She takes excellent care of me and I feel like one of the family.  I have been seeing chiropractors for 42 years and I have found the level of care over the top here at Gold Coast Chiropractic! If you need Chiro care ... give them a try.< /text>< pics>

I have been seeing Dr. David and Lorraine Melendez for over 16 years now. They have helped me and my family with so many issues to date. Since becoming a regular patient of theirs, I have been free from "IBS" (diagnosed and determined un-treatable by doctors), migraines (a neurologist could not come up with the reason I was experiencing these) and pregnancy aches and pains. Just to name a few. They have also changed the lives of my children, who have been adjusted since they were 1 day old. The Doctors' Melendez have helped my babies with spitting up, constipation and digestive issues. I would have very fussy babies if it weren't for the love and care of these Doctors. I am eternally grateful and a patient of Chiropractic for life.</review>

<Review>Could not be more thankful to have found this office. They entire family is conservative in their approach and reassuring, all while being warm and inviting.  Since starting to see them, ny migraines are gone and I rarely have to take any pain medicine. I was also recently badly rear ended and truly believe that without this office, my quality of life would be horrible. They saved me from injections and pain meds. I could not be more thankful to have found this family and could not recommend them more. I’m confident I’ll never see a different chiropractor.</Review>< Resp>

I've been a client of David and Lorraine Melendez for over 20 years and am consistently amazed by the effectiveness of the treatments.  I've been treated by others as I've lived in different parts of the US.  David and Lorraine stand out, not only because of their skills but also because of their character and genuine compassion.  I drive down from Vista to see them to manage a disc problem that I suspect would be much worse without their care.  I am thankful to God for them.</text>

What a great office!  Gold Coast Chiropratic is the perfect place whether you're new to chiropractic or need more serious work done.  Dr. Anna and Dr. Jacob are incredbily professional and really take the time to explain what they are doing and why.  I can't recommend them highly enough.<//Text>

Drs Melendez are ALL the absolute best! From triathletes, to surfers, to babies , to grannies, to poor postured computer techies... all the docs can adjust absolutely anyone!! Each adjustment is conducted with the UTMOST care and precision based upon what your spinal needs are!!

Every single adjustment in that ocean view office is tailor made and I can’t say enough good things about Gold Coast and the healing/testimonies that have come out there! If you are even considering or thinking about chiropractic, go there, bring questions and they are always happy to adjust and educate! Wish I could give TEN stars ⭐️< /Review>

<review>Well, not sure why it’s says i’m Jake, I’m his Mom. I’ve been a patient of Dr. Dave for a long time. I’m a hard case, as I have a lot going on. Dr. Dave always makes me feel better, listens to my whines and always tries to get me to cut  out inflammatory food, lol. Honestly he’s a great chiropractor! When he’s not there I see one of the other doctors and have always been happy. I love he family atmosphere and that they love he Lord and give him he glory!

<Text>Dr. Dave and Lorraine are top-notch!  They are passionate about their profession and it shows in their treatment.  Their system is proven and simple.  Warm up for 5 minutes on the wobble chair, get adjusted by the doc, and then strengthen your spine on the vibration plate!  I have been a patient for 2 years and enjoy not only the physical healing that takes place at Gold Coast, but the spiritual healing as well.  I am now a RAVING FAN!!!<//Text>< user_id>

<text>"Amazing" only mildly describes Drs. David and Lorraine and their staff. They sincerely care about you, not just as a patient, but as a person. They take the time to listen and really provide the treatment that will help you towards healing and general wellness. My husband and I have been seeing them on and off for about 5-6 years or so, and now our infant son gets adjusted whenever we go in for our own treatment. I love this husband and wife team; if anyone I know ever expresses a need for a chiropractor (or even if they don't express a need), I always refer David and Lorraine!<//text><date>1484263184611<//date><user>110247797893987928605<//user><gmapID>0x80dc0c1c5a97e635:0x35d665744880eba2< /gmapID><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>I've been to a few different chiropractic offices in the past and I'm so pleased to say that Gold Coast Chiropractic beats them all. Dr. Dave pays special attention to my spine and neck in a way that heals and prevents injuries. My lower back feels great and has been strong for the heavy lifting and physical activity I do. Their staff is also professional and friendly. Five stars out of five!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>After hearing many not so good things about the Chiropratic world, i was pretty skeptical.
I have been pretty impressed with the care that this husband and wife team take to insure that your moving in the right direction towards healing. I don't feel rushed no mater how busy, I feel like my questions concerns or general curiousness are addressed with great knowledge. I feel like my body is shifting and moving way better then before.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I have been seeing David and Lorraine on and off for years (mostly "off" because they help me so much). I'm not their best client because I don't always do what they recommend, BUT...I see them when the need arises, usually after I've done something either mildly or egregiously stupid. However, once I go in for treatment for about a week, they get me back in the saddle, which gives me the confidence to go out and do even MORE stupid things! I LOVE THEM!<//Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Awesome shop.  They installed a Holley fuel injection system and a tilt steering column in my 72 Dodge Challenger.  The install is super clean and professional.  They work efficiently so you pay a very fair price for labor. They are also very friendly and easy to talk to about project details.  I highly recommend Mandich Auto.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>Travis is the man. He installed an EFI throttle body (MSG) in my 1976 Olds 98. In addition, he lowered my front end by expertly cutting my coils and replaced all the shocks. All I can say is my baby drives like a sleek land yacht. It's a miracle! Travis is a craftsman, however his worked caused a problem. With the added torque and h.p., I need better brakes. Guess where I'm going...

I suggest you call my boy for all your call repairs. He's family.<//text>< rate>

Went here looking for an engine swap for a 1964.5 mustang, they happened to have one in the back of the shop that still ran perfectly. Bought from them for cheap and will be having them install this soon enough. No complaints at all.<//Text>

< review>
I had my first visit to Mandich Automotive and they are truly amazing.  I needed some maintenance and repairs on my 2016 Dodge Grand Caravan.  I needed my battery cables and battery replaced, an oil change and a transmission leak checked out.  Angela and Travis provided exceptional customer service and went above and beyond for me.  They even let me drop off my vehicle the day before to accommodate my work schedule.  I’m happy to have found my forever shop and I will be bringing in my husband’s vehicle soon.  I will also be referring all my friends and family to them as well.
Thank you for doing a great job!<//review>

I'm so so thankful for your kindness and professionalism.
I spent more than 2 months trying to solve this problem, and nobody even wanted to try to help me.

I am a tough customer. Usually find something that bugs me about a shop. Worked as a mechanic when in college and taught by some old school hard nose master mechanics.

This shop is quality and no doubt a master mechanic. Clean shop, friendly service, classic car know how, and honest hard work. I was sent here by a close friend and will send others.<//text>

<text>Mandich Automotive name was given to my family by a friend. They were the right place for the dollar. I got quoted by a different automotive place for work on my air conditioning and it was almost 2k now at this time little to much but called Mandich and they had a better price then 2k. Just under 700. And they did the job correctly. Have to give them 2 thumbs up.

Friendly, professional and quick.
I called them at 10:30 this morning.
Got there at 10:45.
They started working on A/C recharge.
I left at 11:30 in a cold car.
They were able work on my car while working on others.
I made a Weds appointment to get my daughter's car in for the same.
Thanks to O'Reilly's Parts for sending me there!</Text>

<date>1594252374256< /date><Rate>1</Rate><review>Initially I brought my car into mandich to fix my a oil leak. They identified it as the VTI Solenoid. After ordering the part which they initially quoted @ $200 + another $200 for labor to around $400, I was fine with that. Once they finish up the work they called me down and charged my close to $700. I also noticed another oil leak + the engine sounded horrid due to a failed attempt to install spark plugs. This was all due from the mechanic working on the car. I asked them to finish the job since I already paid and I was charged another $60 to fix their own issue. Not happy with this but I’m just happy my car is out there shop. Also the front desk lady is usually nice on the phone , but in person she was really rude and standoffish</review>< Pics>

<resp>{'time': 1594328181796, 'text': 'Sorry you felt the need to give us a bad review. Your total cost was $583 which included $120 was for labor. You were informed of the costs and approved the work at that cost.  You did not request spark plugs to be serviced and when you realized your car was not running as it should you requested we look at the spark plugs on a 2nd visit. The VVT solenoid we replaced had nothing to do with spark plugs which is why we charged you $60 to tighten and adjust them. Both you and your dad said you understood. Our mechanic did his job as you had asked. We also let you know the oil leak was residual from the massive oil leaking all over your engine and it would burn off over time. No other leak was visible.'}< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Great service and professinal. I took my 68 Camaro here. I had issues with my aftermarket gauge cluster which I inherited from the previous owner. I had taken it to two different shops and they couldn't get it to work. They got it to work and prompt. Also took care of the other issues I asked about. Highly reccomend my new 1 stop shop for my classic cars. Thanks.</review>< Pics>

We ate here on a chilly afternoon before watching a movie and we had a awesome dining experience.

Our waiter, Jose was great. He turned on the patio heaters so we were surrounded by them. It was nice and toasty.

We ordered the Skirt Steak entree. Includes a side of steam assorted vegetables and rice, Linguini Frutti di mare- linguini served with garlic, clams, mussels & shrimp in a red sauce and the Spaghetti Carbonara.

The food was delicious and had lots of flavor! It was so good, we forgot to take pictures.< /Text>

I'm from Florida, on vacation here and was looking for a nice place that had steak and Italian food. We found it on Google and had lunch there. Jose was our waiter and he was great! Payed close attention to all our needs and gave us a great service.  Food was also amazing. Had a nice ribeye that was on point.  Loved it, we will be back there.< /Text>

I came in and sat at the bar after spotting the steak dinner specials on Wednesday's for 20$. There's 6 options to choose and since my initial visit I've now been back twice because I've enjoyed the experience so much. My girlfriend joined on my most recent visit and had a grilled chicken salad which was also very good. I can't say enough about the wholesome friendly staff and clientele we've met and chatted with over dinner at the bar. I would certainly suggest stopping in here. Specials each night, but of course I'm partial to Wednesdays.< /text>

We sat outside on a cool evening with tall propane heaters keeping us toasty. They brought baskets of bread with both butter and small cups olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The menu included pasta specials, steaks, chicken, salads and more. We started with a big serving of fried calamari on a bed of greens with lemon wedges and sauce. I had a generous portion of chicken piccata with vegetables cooked just right. Even the children's menu sounded good. Prices were reasonable and we all enjoyed our dinners.< /Text>

<text>Don't try take-out
I ordered the chicken and penne and am very glad I checked the dish before I left. It was very dry and tasteless so I had them make additional sauce. They didn't offer me any cheese, so I had to ask for it. Kinda careless service for a to-go order! I would have been very disappointed if I had not checked the order.
That said, the pasta was decent. But only because I had extra sauce to add flavor.
The bread was very good.<//text><Rating>3</Rating>< Name>

Pleasant friendly staff, lovely ambiance, delicious food with large portions. We were there for lunch. The Cobb Salad and the Golden Pear Salad were ample, fresh, well presented, and with just the right amount of dressing. The ravioli on the special were tender and had a delicious sauce. Fresh bread and butter, excellent service with constant attention to our needs. I can't wait to go back.<//text>

We stopped in here for drinks while waiting for our movie to start nearby.  The bar area was small, but found a spot for two with a bit of luck on a Saturday evening.  It was nice hanging out there.  The staff was very friendly and helpful when we asked about their food.< /text>

Nice looking place with outdoor seating and the choice of food was  varied but...1) the portobello appetizer with blue cheese was a bit salty; 2) the nut - crusted salmon and sole  were both lacking in flavor; 3) the busboy was more interested in sneaking a chat on his cell phone than offering us any more water; 4) other patrons beside us were ignored for a while until a customer from another table went in to ask for service.

It was a nice evening out for us (dinner and a movie), but we won't be returning to the Portobello Grill any time again.< /Text>

I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are several nice restaurants in downtown redwood city, but this is not one of them. The service is terrible. The food was overpriced.

The 5 star ratings on here must be fake, bc there is no way they can be talking about the same Portobello Grill my girlfriend and went to.</text>

The skirt steak was extremely tough and chewy. It was so bad that I did not eat it. When I complained, both the waiter and the Manager said that sometimes it is tender and sometimes it is tough and stringy. Their mushroom Burger was good though.The service was extremely poor. The wrong food was brought to our table and then when the meals that we ordered arrived at our table, two items were not cooked the way they were ordered. The rare steak was well done. By the time those two items came back to us, our other food was cold. The Manager made excuses that it will take him one month to train the waiter.< /Review>

TLDR:
No wait at prime time on Saturday night
Staff seemed confused and unorganized
Had to add salt to my dish, which I can't recall ever having done

I had higher expectations, but I suppose I should have known this wasn't really going to be the best when there wasn't a wait at prime dinner time on a Saturday night. Not to say the place wasn't busy. The hostess and servers seemed confused and not very organized. After our menus were brought, and man put water on the other end of the table from us, that we dragged towards our place settings. When our server arrived about 15 minutes after we were seated, he simply asked, "Do you know what you want?" While he wasn't rude, and was attentive and friendly for the rest of the meal, it's not the norm at a "white table cloth" restaurant. Our food arrived in an appropriate time after we ordered. I had to add salt to my food. I do not like salty food, and I actually don't even own a salt shaker in my house, but the spaghetti carbonara lacked any flavor, what so ever. The most flavorful part of the dish were the english peas. My partner also  begrudgingly added salt to his meal, because the tomato sauce was flat and tasteless. We didn't have any cocktails, and after the dinner skipped dessert.< /Review>

It's a nice restaurant. The service was good and the food was tasty. I had the Petrale Sole special with roasted potatoes and vegetable. But it's nothing special and we just went there because we were hungry and wanted to go to the movies afterwards. swo we were in the area. We never really find a perfect restaurant in Redwood City near Broadway:) So it was the best we found and we were full and it was good.<//text>

Don't eat the fish.  Had a case of food poisioning Monday, the 3rd of October.  Looked up the type and its called Histamine Toxicity which means the fish was not kept cool enough.
Called and spoke to manager?  No real justice, just said he would look into it....< /Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The salmon I ordered was at the ideal point. The food very good as well as its presentation.

The attention in general is good, both in English and in Spanish. The desserts part was not the best however I would rate it as regular.

There is public parking nearby which facilitates access to the restaurant.

Horrible experience! Looks good on the outside, but good luck ever using the amenities - they are always shut down for “unexplained” reasons. Need to use the elevator? Forget it. It’s broken every week. Even if it is working, it moves at a snails pace or there’s a cleaning crew holding it for 10 minutes while they wipe it down in the middle of the day. Want to speak with management about any issues - the response is similar to: F-off, we don’t care. Stephanie, the “manager” should not be in ANY role that deals with humans. No empathy, doesn’t try to find solutions, tries to coax people to move out if they’re unhappy or threatens them with “putting you on a list” instead of doing her job, which is to manage. Having my own business, I would NEVER treat people the way she and this company treats the people that pay them!

If you want to pay to live here, never use the amenities, never have a working elevator, and deal with insanely rude staff, then this is the place for you. Rest assured you can’t ever ask for something, because the only response you’ll get it: “maybe you should move out” or  “you should leave” - true professionalism. Come hang out for a day around the grounds and ask a few people walking around. You’ll get all the answers you need.<//Review>

<review>If you're looking for an apartment in Irvine, Westview should absolutely be your TOP CHOICE. I have been looking for the perfect apartment for my mother for over a month, touring close to 30 apartment communities; in all that time, we did not come across a single community as BEAUTIFUL, SAFE, and WELCOMING as Westview Apartments. The apartments are beautiful and the grounds are clean and well-maintained. What's more, the community manager (Stephanie Khalfi) and our leasing agent (John Parker) have worked together tirelessly to personally make sure that every part of our moving experience is top tier.

Stephanie goes beyond "customer service," treating our problems as if they were her own: I told her that I was nervous about moving my mother to a new community after we had a horrible experience at our previous community, and Stephanie made it her personal mission to ensure that my mother felt comfortable and happy about coming to Westview. From working on our requests until 9:00PM on a Friday, to personally calling us on her days off, to helping us coordinate our move from our previous community, Stephanie truly represents the Irvine Company with a sense of humanity and pride that is astounding. Add to that John's unfaltering positivity and technical expertise, and we could not be more excited to move into our new home at Westview this month. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<//review><Response>{'time': 1630625464383, 'text': 'We appreciate you taking the time to reach out and share your experience, Akanksha!

When you've been a renter at many apartment complexes across many years, you know how difficult it is to find a good one and how easy it is to land somewhere that makes life difficult. Westview isn't just a good find, it truly is a place that you can feel at home. Staff at any apartment complex has a tough job dealing with a wide variety of tenants and their concerns, and the staff at Westview do this job incredibly well. They are so attentive and considerate, and make every effort they can to be accommodating which makes all the difference in the world. They provide such an exemplary experience for residents. My wife and I were extremely lucky to have found this place, and we highly recommend it.< /review>

<text>I have been here since the complex was built and have been very pleased with the overall customer service and property.  You will always have neighbors who do not comply with apartment living, that is not the fault of the leasing office since they surely cannot predict human behavior when they are leasing to them.  Some folks just don't respect others by not cleaning up their dog poop or playing loud music, they shouldn't live in apartments.  But Westview does an awesome job of trying to make everyone's life here comfortable and pleasant.  I love living here and will no doubt live here for many years to come.<//text><Date>1580055570921< /Date><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

<time>1621788412040< /time><review>The main trap is when you move out; when I moved in there was scratches all over the Vinyl flooring, I took pictures and sent them to the management. They said that is fine and they don’t charge me for these and it is considered wear and tear. However, on move out, they charged me for an entire flooring of the flat even though I sent the them the original pictures of the scratches. My pictures from the move in day proves that the flooring was not new at all. However, with Irvine co. you have no rights. It is just them and their money.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dcdd5f55e2b101:0xd0f4b437c5bc158b<//gmap_id>< Response>

Ive been living at Westview for 4 months and Nicole helped me find a great apartment and was wonderful, friendly and resourceful throughout the leasing process.  Everyone in the office so friendly and helpful and they’re all such a pleasure to work with when I need assistance.  Stephanie, the Manager, is always so responsive, nice and helpful to me. The Maintenance and Porter staff also do a great job with all the work they do and keep the grounds clean! Thanks Westview I love my new home!!<//review>

I'm changing my rating from 1 to 5.
Wanted to thank Stephanie  for having everything fixed. I can't express enough for her attentiveness and willingness to listen and address all issues as fast as possible. I'm very happy and ready to start a new lunar year living in this complex.

----
prev complaint:
I've moved into the complex in the beginning of February,2021 and so far very disappointed with the apartment for the money I'm paying. It looks nice outside, but once you start living here it falls apart.

1. Keys for a gate was broken, so I had to go back and replace it.
2. Heater was broken and took two days to fix it.
3. Electricity was off next day I moved in, I understand is not related to the company, but it adds up to my experience.
4.The shower was licking. I saw a white patch, so it was an issue before, but wasn’t addressed on time. The wall is slowly starting to peel off.
They replaced the shower, but didn't fix the wall, so I had to point to it rather than having it fixed on the first place, still waiting.
5. Drier wasn’t working. It works better now, but still takes long time to dry clothes.
6. Washer is not cleaning clothes properly, it doesn't spin during a washing phase. I asked to fix it, and was told that all building has old model that would work like that.
Main reason I chose this place is having W/D in unit, and it doesn't work as I expected. Better to move to a unit without W/D and decrease my rent up to 400$ per month.
7. There is few scratches on the ceil, walls, furniture and fridge. Kept pictures for the records. Nothing was patched

I pay a lot for 1br apartment and expected those basic needs to be checked before I moved in, now I'm wasting my time and having emotional stress over those things I shouldn't even worry about.

I still considering to move out even though I paid so much to move in, plus time and who knows how much they would charge me for breaking the lease.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<text>DO NOT MOVE HERE!!! I moved to this complex almost a year ago under the pretense that it was newer, smaller and would be a quiet / comfortable community. That quickly changed when our downstairs neighbor terrorized us with tons of noise early in the am and late in the evenings, we’re patient people, but let us sleep! We complained to the leasing office countless times, had a leasing staff member enter our apartment to verify the noise and even then through quarantine this continued / escalated with no solution. That’s not including all the constant partying occurring on an almost nightly basis from surrounding neighbors on a 2nd floor (ground level here). Countless security reports later and nothing has been done. As if the noise factors weren’t enough, we’re paying over $3,000 a month for zero amenities this entire year. Residents were finally allowed some pool access by late summer and that was also catastrophic, leasing staff members have preferential treatment to certain residents who had pool access everyday while the rest of us were restricted to 1 to 2 hours of pool time once a week. What a joke! If you’re looking to move here, think long and hard because leasing staff works against you and with / for you. You’ll be bombarded by invalid notices from complaints by retaliatory neighbors whom have zero respect for quiet hours.<//text>< pics>

We've been living in Westview apartment for a couple of months now, great location, and great amenities.
I tour couple other apartments in the area and overall westview was the most cleanest and very quiet place.
Moving can be hard during pandemic for a full time working single mom, but the leasing process with Kai was great and made it easier.
The community manager Stephanie, is always available and very professional to help with any issue I might have.<//Text>

<Text>This is by far the most horrible experience I’ve had as a tenant. The rent is very high but the service and leasing office is absolutely horrible. 3 people claim to be the manager and whenever they can’t help they defer to the other person. They won’t give you the proper contact to reach their superiors in the Irvine company. I have made videos of the dehumidifier machine they have installed in my unit and have asked me to cope with this psychologically abusive sound for 4 more days instead of relocating me or any form of compensation whatsoever. They lie constantly and have given me smoking noticed when I have never smoked a cigarette in my life. DO NOT MOVE HERE.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I lived here for a year and a half and I really loved it. This complex is really unique in that it has a lot of outdoor space to use on the second floor. They have 2 double salt water pools and many units have extra large patios. I would love to move back at some point in the future. I have researched a lot of comparable complexes in Newport/Irvine/Costa Mesa and honestly I think this is as good as it gets for an apartment.</Text><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

<rating>1< /rating><text>My wife and I made an appointment to tour the place so that we could get a feel for this apartment. However, the leasing person, Kai, flat out lied to our faces stating that the apartment was 100% occupied and we could not see any actual units. He said we could only see a couple models... I repeatedly told him that I wanted to see anything available so that we can get a true idea of the apartment and not just a propped up version.

Before I left I mentioned that there were units showing available online. I guess he felt guilty that he got caught lying to us so he emailed us saying "ya one of them just got leased but it looks like you can see one." Thanks, but no thanks. Why couldn't you just show us an empty unit while we were there? Anyways, it was too late because I was touring other apartments nearby and couldn't get the message (Not that I would go).

Was I a victim of discrimination?
I don't know for sure.

But for everyone else, make sure if they tell you the apartment is 100% occupied, don't believe the lies. These large apartment complexes cannot be occupied 100%. Make sure to ask for a manager because you might be a victim of discrimination too.<//text>< response>

So I've lived here almost 14 months so far -

Pros: Location, Amenities (Gym, Pools, etc), Friendly Staff (Leasing, Maintenance, Security and otherwise)

Cons: Fire Alarm, Door/FOB (maid access), Blinds (need to install white/blackout combo blinds vs transparent white only), Washer & Dryer (IrvineCo - time to get a deal with LG or Samsung, come on :)

I have not listed noise as an issue for me - as a person that is home 90% of the time, since I typically just work from home -- it has not been an issue for me during that day.  It really has not even been an issue for me during the night.

Every now and then I do hear a little boom shaking noise like my neighbor is lifting weights or something above me haha - but to be honest I've grown used to it and it is so infrequent it doesn't bother me.

I feel like people writing negative reviews based on noise have unrealistic expectations.  If you are not OK with a little noise then you probably shouldn't live in such close quarters.

To be honest I've had loud music playing and some people over a few times and security has been out a small % as well to politely ask us to lower it, but we are always respectful once someone has reached out either directly or indirectly.

Perhaps I'm lucky - as I feel the amount of noise complaints on me have actually been quite low... so I'm not sure if my direct neighbors are on the same wave length as me and are able to deal with each others minor noise generation levels.

Also I've no idea what people are complaining about with parking -- there is two garages with guest parking as well as the assigned parking spots all seem empty to me for the most part.

Anyways - I'm generally happy here - there were some frustrating moments in the beginning, but the staff has always been friendly and with the exception of the issue in regards to my maid not able to obtain her own FOB for her entry of which she is accustomed to from my prior location - forcing me to leave my door open most of the time, but hey - I haven't been robbed yet either.

So all in all I guess I've really just had an entirely different experience then some of these other reviewers.  I think you'll be happy as long as you appropriately manage your expectations.< /Review>

Westview charged us, after we moved out, $500 for laminate floor repairs and replacement. We only saw some light scratches in the photo proof that was sent to us. It was just normal tear and wear. We tried to dispute the charge but Westview is refusing to remove or reduce the charge.

Before we moved out, we also did a pre-move out inspection, no issues were identified; We were told to be only responsible for carpet cleaning and apartment cleaning fee.

It was so unethical to rip good tenants off during this difficult time. I'll file a small claim lawsuit to get my deposit back.<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I came across this page this morning after a completely frustrating night of loud upstairs neighbors and finally just had to voice my thoughts.  Let me start by saying that if I did not have upstairs neighbors I would have left a much better review but the noise that I have to deal with makes my living here unbearable.  I did reach out to both the neighbor and to the office (which has been very understanding and courteous) but there is really nothing anyone can do.  Its not that the neighbor is having parties blasting music etc, its just that the apartments are built (like someone else mentioned) fairly cheaply and there is no sound barrier or cement substrate between floors.  As others have mentioned I can also hear every footstep and they are very active from 6am to after midnight some days.  I hate coming home because it just frustrates me that I pay several thousand a month and hate being in my unit.  When I reached out to the office I was basically given 2 options - find a different unit (all now higher rent than when I moved in) then re-lease as if I am a new resident with the clock starting at day 1 again (I would also be out money to move my belongings) or deal with it basically.  I could walk away completely but then I would lose 2 months rent to break the lease for an issue I did not cause.  They politely offered to send someone to listen to the noise and possibly cite the neighbor but how do you reprimand someone for being active in their apartment??  Its the construction of the unit that creates the noise.  When you can hear every footstep walking back and forth all day every day its beyond mind numbing.  For this reason I can only give the complex 1 star and unfortunately count the days until my lease expires.  Before I chose Westview I asked many questions regarding the construction of the unit and about possible noise  I was assured I could find solace here.  Unfortunately the person who sold me on it no longer works here.  For some perspective - I have been here over 10 months.  When I moved in I would have also given it 5 stars since it was just half full and brand new.  Now that the complex has filled up the noise and other issues have become more prominent.  I understand you will always have to deal with certain issues as a renter but this has put me at wits end.  This review was written for perspective for future residents rather than as a vendetta against my neighbors or the complex.</Review>< pictures>

Be careful when you move out because they will charge you a paint and cleaning fee even if you leave the place spotless.  They will not return your deposit and it was an extremely unpleasant experience.<//Review>

I have been lived in Irvine company communities since 2014 , since July 2019 I lived  in  Westview apartment  and ever since the service in general was beyond  satisfied Interims of Mentenence, cleanness and costumer service from the leasing office .
Until the management has been changed and every thing want down to poor level of service which effected our life stile in the community, until lately when the incident took the place in the leasing office on Saturday 3/7/2029 when I came to ask the manager ( Stephanie Khalfi) about my wife’s car that been towed without any notice I was shocked with her attitude and her aggressive way of responding by calling the police. It was really extremely frustrated that she called the police for me to solve misunderstanding<//text>

Apartment complex is incredibly well kept and cleaned everyday.  The build quality to apartments is top notch and I have no issues of noise. In my opinion the walls are very sound proof and I can’t relate to some of the complainers on here.  The leasing office staff really shines here and go above and beyond to assist in any situation.< /text>

Moved into a two bedroom in 9 months ago then shifted to a one bedroom. Property is clean (maybe minor issues), staff is friendly and helpful,  most residents are friendly, amenities are great- (in particular the barbecue grills, pool, bathrooms, fire-pit for the win!) , maintenance is great. My only grievance would be that the blinds in the units are super thin and let tons of light in at night. Residents have to install their own curtains for any sort of darkness. I'm on a corporate lease so cannot really comment on the value-for money.<//text>

It seems to have great amenities but the floor plans we looked at didn't use space economically and there were almost no closets built in for storage. One if them literally only had the bedroom closet. Adding that to needing a waiting list for a second parking spot means that it's not a good fit for us, but for someone else it could be perfect.<//text>

It is true that you hear your neighbor pounding on the floor above you regularly but that has been this case in every apartment I have lived in when you are not on the top floor. I am giving it 5 stars to offset the single  1 star review because the place is actually quite nice and the people in the leasing office are extremely pleasant and helpful. Not their fault if there is an upstairs neighbor that has no sense or common courtesy. I purposely try to step lightly when I am in my apartment because I realize barring the floor is made of unobtainium, you are going to hear a rude upstairs neighbor.

Note, the place is extremely expensive. I pay $2200 a month for a single bedroom with no storage and no balcony. Again though, very beautiful, nice, and well maintained apartment complex if you can afford it.</review>

I agree with most of these bad reviews! Yes, parking is nuts, you hear footsteps from people above, but that's not even how bad. So it's 12:50 PM, my move out inspection was scheduled for 12 PM. NO ONE SHOWED UP OR CONTACTED ME TO SAY THEY WOULD BE LATE. When I called the office they said, oh let me check... oh looks like they got caught up on an emergency maintenance issue . Yeah right! Let's see if they show up. I'm sure they don't want to do the inspection so they can charge me a ridiculous amount of money, like they did when I moved from the Park! Charged us for full paint (nothing was EVER done to the walls and we don't smoke) and full carpet (I ran into the new tenant and they confirmed the carpet was not NEW!). This will be MY LAST stay with Irvine Company! Oh, and if that's not BAD ENOUGH! The night security guard is always sleep on the patio sofa at the model across from me. Yeah, I hear (and see him) snoring away every night! Why are we paying for security if he's sleep! Can't wait to get out of here! Only 3 days left! Just come for my move-out inspection so I'll have proof this time that you said "everything was fine", so when you give me that big bill, I'll sue you! :D<//Text>

This place gets worse and worse. Parking is a JOKE here. They charge you a $75 service fee to pay rent on THEIR app. You cannot pay rent to the office, you have to mail it to some address they give to you...but remember if the check doesn't get delivered on time you get charged.  I swear as the weeks go on more and more turns up. This place seems like to come up with their own rules until you show them the lease and they finally back off. The manager that is Asian and sits behind a glass near the coffee area was so rude and disrespectful to me. I will say I did go off on him. But, he got away with it and so now he thinks its ok to treat others like that. If you want a stress free complex...DO NOT COME HERE!!!!< /review>

Just moved in a month ago & couldn't be any more happy. My gf & I are loving the perks of living here, the 2 salt water pools, the 24h gym studio, great surrounding of stores around us. Hard wood floors, wash dryer inside of closet, lots of storage, GOOGLE FIBER & our cat is really enjoying the large windows. Dilal showed us around & made the decision way easier. Thanks again!</review>

The facade is great.  Plus its new so it still has shine but the apartments are made of cardboard.  God forbid you want some quiet time.  Barking dogs, paper thin walls,  constant hum from generators. and horribly thin floors let you hear every footstep your upstairs neighbor takes.  Oh and those fire alarms.  They go off if you just think about cooking.  Cant beat the location but its not worth the price unless you want to live like your still in a college dorm.<//Text>

<time>1555383517668< /time><rate>1</rate><review>UPDATE 2: If you are a EV owner like me, forget about this place. You can't charge your car here. It has only 1 EV spot, that is also marked to be used by Handicapped. So basically you are not able to leave your car and charge it. And it's always occupied of course. Not by EV mostly. Even less expensive apartment I lived before can provide you with at least 5-10 EV spots to charge. But not this "luxury" place.

UPDATE: Had to update it again and lower the rating even more. It's getting almost impossible to live. The worst part is that nobody from Westview Leasing office cares much about that. When I called to Courtesy Patrol and report that fact again I was told that guard will take care of it and reach me after. Nobody ever came to me since then. Still waiting for 2h+. I think I should better call police instead if courtesy patrol is so unreliable. I don't know why I'm still paying so much money for this place. Even courtesy patrol can't work properly here.

ORIGINAL: It would be the greatest community if the construction would be less noisy. If you don’t live at the highest floor, then be ready to hear every step that your neighbors do. No, they don’t have a party. Otherwise you could’t even watch a TV in front of you. My guests, who came to me once, now prefer to stay in the DoubleTree hotel right next to this community - it’s the best example of how bad are almost all constructions where I’ve been living with an Irvine Apartment Company so far.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Completely agree with most that has been posted.  Place is nice to look at from the outside but the construction is pathetic.  People talk about lax security and paper thin ceilings...yes 100%.  I can literally hear every single footstep my upstairs neighbors take.  Think about it....you pay 3 grand for an apartment and hate coming home because the footstep noise is so damn annoying.  Its like there is 1 sheet of plywood between floors.  Completely lied to when asked about construction before signing lease.  I would move tomorrow if they would let me out of my lease without forking over 6 grand+.</Text><rate>1< /rate><response>{'time': 1534791935875, 'text': 'We regret to hear that you have experienced these issues.

<review>Unless you love listening to your neighbor walk around all day avoid this place.  If you are in a top floor unit I could see how you might like it here.  Any other floor is a coin flip depending on who moves in above you. Counting the days until Im free.  Courtesy patrol has nothing to do with neighbor noise so please dont respond assuming they are having a party.  This is everyday noise that comes right thru the floors.  Cheaply constructed units.  Its almost laughable</review>< pics>

<Review>This part is added on 11/7/18 to comment on the westview team’s response to my initial review: no one from westview contacts me at all as of 11/7 - a week after their response ... case in point

I have been to a lot of places and lived in four different countries. This has been my worst experience with apartment renting. I broke the lease after only two months. I’d rather pay penalty over having to deal with the frustration.
I was hoping to pay more for peace of mind but dealing with the office staff people stresses me out. Sales person never responded to voice message or call back. Office staff seems not experienced and apology is not in their choice of words even though they gave me instructions inconsistently and incorrectly. I often have to talk to 2-3 people to get an answer that turn out to be totally different from the first answer. I have to reach out to them to get information about moving in otherwise they won’t send me or schedule me for check-in. Emails often don’t get responded within 2 days by the office manager. I got fed up with them and broke the lease. They kept saying that they will ask the community manager to give me a call and he/she never did. Ground staff is courteous. I wish the office people who get pay more lear n some of that basic courtesy.
If you are international person, be aware that they are not sensitive to your needs or situations. They assume you know everything without explaining so you don’t even know what to ask. I certainly will never want to deal with anything irvine company related - not even job.</Review>< Rating>

The noise complaints are real. Everyday noises seep through from neighboring apartments. If you have a noisy and inconsiderate neighbor then don't expect much help other than lip service from Management.

Would not recommend this community, especially not for the price.< /Review>

<review>People in the office have been very kind unfortunately car got stolen on the secured lower level 😖Im not sure if the apartment management could've done anything to prevent this from happening 😖 after the fact the leasing office has been very helpful offering to look through their security system in case the police department needed some form of evidence. I was definitely distrough because as I had chosen this apartment complex because of the perceived safety. I will be breaking my contract an unfortunately I will be paying the required 2 months rent ($4,220). Not sure if auto theft is a problem throughout Irvine but I was for sure suprised this happened within the first few weeks of moving in. The office staff has been very helpful and kind.

<text>For summer, this is the place to go for bike rentals - best prices. Scott went out of his way to make sure I got my bike after hours, so I was ready to ride the next morning.  He gave me great ideas on some trails to try. If we had more time, I would get one for my teen, but that's for the next time.  His price was incredibly reasonable and I liked my bike. Don't just think of Scotty's for the winter - they are fantastic for the summer too! $25/day was perfect - I'm glad I thought ahead and talked to Scott to arrange getting a bike for 3 days.</text><Time>1532924077497< /Time><response>{'time': 1532924879239, 'text': 'Thanks so much for taking the time to give us such a wonderful review!

Overall was fantastic experience, ended up staying in the store way longer due to awesome conversation with Scott and Donny themselves.

Such a great experience here. They were so helpful, and hooked me up with a brand new board for a great price, plus a hot wax. I definitely will be directing my friends here for rentals.</review>

<Review>Scotty, the owner, is one of the most knowledgeable, helpful and, down to earth guys to assist you. This man had a shop full of people and somehow managed to be attentive to everyone who walked in! The energy was welcoming and Scotty made us feel very comfortable throughout the entire process - from explaining which board would be best for me, as a beginner - to running to the back of the store and digging out a pair of Burton boots that miraculously fit like a glove. He never once tried to oversell us and gave us a great deal on everything we bought (even on some discounted items). I would absolutely recommend this shop to Anyone and will definitely be back! This place is RAD. Scotty is the man!<//Review></record>

<Review>Scotty’s was the best!

My wife and I had tried getting rental help at several other shops in the area and Scotty was by far the most helpful and kindest to us. Will definitely keep going back there and highly recommending his shop to our friends.<//Review><user_name>aldous photo<//user_name><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x80c4abeaf2041709:0xc252d2d3ddfee572</Gmap_id>< user>

<review>Scotty's has been the go to place for my family and I for over a decade. It's such a good deal and super easy to grab and go before and after boarding. I have not been able to make it up to Bear the last few years but tomorrow I finally get to make a trip up there and will definitely be stopping by the shop for all my boarding needs! Another plus is that all their boards are way newer than the one I have sitting in my garage :)<//review>< pics>

Scotty’s is the best in big bear! Honestly- not only were they affordable but the staff is down to earth and there to help. They hooked us up with great rental boards for the day. They’re location is perfect- making it quick and convient to pick up/drop off the boards on my way in and out of town.

I also got a killer deal on a my own new board! They set me up with all I needed for a crazy discount! Even threw in handmade wall hangers so I could keep my board on display! I absolutely love it and am so excited that it came from such a cool board shop.

I will for sure be heading back to Scotty’s next time I’m in big bear. Highly recommended<//Text>

Scotty is totally friendly and makes you feel like a part of the family. They have the best prices on the mountain for sure, and he's willing to male recommendations if he somehow doesn't have exactly what you need. Right now he's having a clearance sale, we scored some great stuff for way way way below retail!</text>

<text>My girlfriend and I have been coming to Scotty's for about 2 years now and every stop has been a great experience. Scotty and his staff are always extremely welcoming and very knowledgeable. It's rare nowadays to find a family owned place that makes you feel welcomed every time you walk through the door. His rentals are extremely reliable and well priced. If you are looking to buy some gear for yourself don't hesitate to ask, he will make something happen for you! My gf and I walked away with boards, goggles and other accessories. you won't find a better place on the mountain!</text><gmapID>0x80c4abeaf2041709:0xc252d2d3ddfee572< /gmapID><time>1523650407224< /time>< response>

<review>I came to this ride shop to rent a snowboard and boots, and had my credit card information stolen by them. At this rental shop they have a unusual method of keeping a down payment for the gear you rent in the event you don’t return it. Here at Scotty’s ride shop they scan you credit card and ID. I was skeptical when they explained the process, and when I asked about putting a payment down I was told that was not a option. So I went with it that in good faith they would not keep my information, however they did and three days later I had 1000$ charged to my card even though I had returned all gear (in the same condition I received it). But this was not the only issue I had with this business, they set me up with a snowboard with the foot clamps set in board. I didn’t know how a snowboard was to be set up so I went with it. After a couple runs down the slope one of the safety personnel noticed that the board was improperly configured and fixed it for me, and explained the danger of having the board set in a pigeon toed configuration. I hope this proves clarity to what this really is, I would advise no one to conduct business here unless you want credit card fraud.<//review>< response>

<rating>5</rating><review>Went there with a bunch of friends not much experience between us but he was extremely helpful with tips about gear and how to ride better. He even pointing us to other shops when he only had expensive googles and such left in stock. His pricing seemed very fair and and he has quality gear, much better experience with his boards than any other I have rented before.<//review>< pics>

After a day of trekking through some secluded roads and trails on the coast,  a quick stop here on the way home is the perfect spot to wash the vehicle off from the dust and grime collected throughout the day. It’s convenient and reasonable. I like a clean vehicle!!<//Review>

A great do-it-yourself car wash if you aren't too finnicky. Vacuum costs $2 for 4 mins. Wash is $3 for 4mins. My car was really dirty inside and out.   The vacuum worked well on sand, hay, dog hair.  It took two rounds with the wash, so the whole job cost $10.  The drain at my wash stall was plugged so I was wading in water, glad I had old tennies on.  There's a bill changer that only gives car wash tokens.  Safe and no line to get in.< /Text>

<text>This was such a disappointment, and I’m a hard one to get dissatisfied easily. 2.00 for 4 minutes with a vacuum that was UTTERLY USELESS. Left with high blood pressure and STILL a car in need of a legitimate vacuuming!</text>< pics>

Nice place to wash your car. Vacuums work great. Clientele is safe as well. Takes quarters as well as tokens.<//Review>

Way too expensive for a coin wash. Not enough time to do your car, and you even have to pay for vacuuming which is also over priced for such an under kept coin wash.</text>

<Review>Don't use the brushes PERIOD. I just looked at my paint and there are streaks of deep scratches all over my truck! Awful experience in that aspect. Don't mean to be a business killer, which I'm sure one bad review won't do, but don't use the brushes.< /Review>< pics>

Really nice place to go and have dinner with a date!
Ordering from the menu was a bit tricky if you don't know what you want lol
I recommend getting the California roll combo with salmon <3
They also have some imported beer that tasted pretty good! would go back anytime! maybe with more family members too just to show them the place<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I’m from Las Vegas and we have good sushi but this was some of the best sushi I have ever had. From what I had the sushi was just as good as my grandmother’s favorite place that she has been going to for over 10 years. My dad and I sat outside but they set it up so that there was minimal wind and had heat towers. The food was great, the atmosphere was nice, and the service was friendly and kind. Ten out of ten would recommend.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrdAPuW9zlgqwjNZ8iVLvJ_M1QrXE3QNiElx15=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

This place was pretty good, I won a family meal and I couldn't say no to sushi. Some of the sauces were a little overwhelming but the quality of the salmon and tuna was pretty great. The miso soup was perfect.</text>

The Best in town. Great service. Best rolls. Everything is always so fresh. They have been the most consistent restaurant my wife and I have ever dealt with in Bakersfield. You will not be disappointed by picking Miyoshi's.< /text>

Tasty Japanese food place here in town.  Bento boxes are nice, Udon is tasty, Chicken fried rice is the bomb, and their sushi is always fresh! Staff is friendly and attentive and restaurant is clean.< /text>

<text>For Bakersfield, it is the best sushi. Fish is as fresh as it can possibly be. I love the service and everything I order is tasty. I order out a lot and they always get the order right.

One of my fav places for quality Japanese food. Service is always super even when they have a full house. Prices were appropriate. I can see why they have a lot of positive reviews.<//Review>

Tried to place an order for a sushi family set. Call back to see if its ready and they didnt even put in the order. Shouldve known cuz she didnt even take my name or number then the other guy who I talked to was giving me attitude and being sarcastic and laughing.

<Review>BEST sushi in town. Took our family of six for dinner. Good miso and seaweed salad. Albacore sushi was just okay tonight, but the spicy tuna roll and yellow submarine rolls were very tasty. Yellow submarine roll is a family favorite. Good quick service, friendly waitresses...a good experience as always</Review>< Pictures>

No fads or gimmicks like sushi time or love sushi, every roll isn't slathered in mayonnaise and spicy sauce, and they don't try to achieve some weird combination of Mexican food and sushi and upcharge you because "fusion." Just a nice, unassuming, reasonably priced sushi restaurant with really good food and service. I've been eating at Miyoshi for 16 years and I really enjoy their quality and consistency.<//Text>

My Wife and I had wonderful service; It seemed like everyone working welcomed us in, the server was very polite and refilled our drinks as needed. The portion of the food is definitely worth the price and has lots of flavor. The seating area is small so it will get crowded very fast. This business should definitely upgrade to a larger space if possible. Very good food and service, my Wife and I will come back frequently.</text>

Terrible food..Extremely high prices for the small food you get. I paid $25 for lunch😱 (but wanted to try out). Got lots of rice & very little shrimp & coke for my $25.  I won't be back, & don't recommend ☹.<//text>

Because of the popularity of the place and the number of tables, there can be an extensive wait during peak hours. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive. The rolls tend to be very large so be careful about over-ordering.</text><UserId.>100114029961721721528< /UserId.>< Resp>

<text>Great place.  I've been a long time fan of Tokyo Garden and Miyoshi is the same owner and in a lot of ways like a second location.

The Sushi here and at Tokyo Garden is by far the best in Bakersfield.  I've tried almost every sushi place in town and even ventured outside of Bakersfield in a quest to find good sushi.  By far, you can't get much better than this.

One detail I love is that they don't put some mayonnaise / imitation crab meat slurry in their rolls.  Next time you go somewhere and order a roll that has crab meat in it, take a look and you'll notice that it's not sliced peaces inside but instead it's a bunch of mayo mixed together with finely minced crab meat and stuffed inside there.  Not here and not at Tokyo Garden.

For me it's the little details that matter and this place does it right down to the smallest fraction.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>I don't know about the people that have left bad reviews because I've had nothing but consistent excellent service for six years now.  My husband & I have never gotten sick, and we love the raw stuff.  We also haven't had issues being seated when it's always just the two of us.  I'm also a very picky eater and always make a bunch of changes, i.e. no green onions ever, and no cucumbers on certain roles.  Even so, the requests are done and our service remains positive & pleasant.  On occasion, green onions will be on our roles and have to be returned.  The rolls come back onion free, and the service is still good without decline.  This place is actually responsible for getting me hooked and addicted to sushi because I never liked it before.  The winning roll that started it all was the popular Yellow Submarine.  I order one every time I eat sushi and now order other items - depending on what mood I'm in as to what else I want to eat.  So, for the six years of great service and excellent sushi, I give this restaurant 5 stars.  Keep up the good work.<//text><username>Mrs McQN</username><rating>5</rating><GmapID>0x80ea43d4c0e4cf69:0x5f963c3630205829<//GmapID><user>112685905755447015127</user><pictures>None< /pictures><time>1406936260403< /time></record></dataset><record>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>Yvonne Turkal</user_name><review>We had our first experience enjoying sushi in Santa Cruz this July, so when we arrived home the first thing we did was to look for a sushi resaurant locally. We found Miyoshi had 4 stars so we passed three other sushi restaurants closer to our house to see what 4 stars tasted like. We were seated as soon as we walked into the restaurant and the waitress, Yuki, was a delight. She listened to what we had in Santa Cruz and helped us custom make our own roll. It was delicious-our thanks to their chef Andy. We will probably become regular customers. I am vegetarian and my husband of 44 years this September is vegetarian by default, so it is nice to have found a wonderful restaurant where we can have an excellent meal.< /review>< user_id>

Just walked in and left with in 10 min.  Plenty of tables open but couldn't be seated unless 3 or more. They wanted my coworker and I to wait untill  a small table was available. We left, hungry and dissapointed.  When we notified the manager,  we were brushed off and told that is policy.. I guess they think 3 or more potential customer is better then 2 ready to eat customers.<//text>

<Text>Love this place and the unique rolls the offer. probably the best sushi around. The sashimi is fairly fresh most of the time. They offer the standard japanese beers, which is a must-have with sushi. Pricing is moderate, for sushi, so don't expect discount prices here. Haven't tried the bento boxes or other dinners, but seem to be popular with other diners. The place is on the smallish side, so oftentimes there is a wait.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>1...2...3... Strikes and you're out.

My girlfriend and I are from Phoenix, AZ, and this was hands down the most disappointing sushi we have ever had. Despite all the great reviews, miyoshi failed to deliver on any front. From the interesting (to put it nicely) service experience to the food, we were disappointed. We only ordered basics, and they failed there, making us afraid to try one of the more expensive rolls.

First strike:
Miso soup 0 out of 5 : Tasted like brine water that was left to reduce all day... Missing ingredients and even spoons.

Second strike:
California roll 1 out of 5 : seriously, how do you mess up a cali roll? Its krab salad, cucumber and avocado... Rice was not cooked right and ingredients were bland and almost tasteless.

Third strike:
Spicy tuna roll 1 out of 5: again, rice fell apart and pretty tasteless.

Summary:
Every restaurant we have tried is AZ has been better. Would not recommend. Seriously, it was bad...< /text>< rate>

This place gave me food poisoning. I saw the reviews for Miyoshi's and decided it would be a good fit. About 4 hours after eating at Miyoshis I threw up intermittently for about 3 hours afterwards. The food was good when I ate it; Though the Albacore did taste a little fishy (should have taken that as a sign not to eat it). The staff was unprofessional. The selection of food is average. I would not recommend this Miyoshi's or any of it's other locations to anyone. Which is a shame.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Time>1417552449695</Time><text>I went in a few days ago. It was my last day at school, decided to treat myself to something good. This was also my second time experiencing Japanese food and the first was at sakura buffet on ming three years ago. I went in and there was only two people there eating. I had their 12 dollar "special" with beef and four sashimi sushi "rolls". I didn't like it at all. The beef tasted old and had a lot of fat. The sashimi rolls were warm and the noodles were plastic-y. After I ate about half of the plate I felt queezy. I thought I was going to be sick, but I didn't get sick fortunately. I'm never eating there again.<//text><user_id>104001192246001460015<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

I am never disappointed with this location. All the employees here are amazing but I want to give Roger or Rog a special shout out. That guy is so genuine and I am at awe not only with his professionalism but how genuine he is. He makes me feel like I have known him for years! Every time I came I always got the chance to engage with him and this last time he came to ask about my drink and was out with it within a minute!! Such a kind soul and I will always come back not for the quality of drinks but the quality of customer service! Roger shines bright and always gives me this vibe and smile that lasts the whole day. To the Akers stand, you have my heart.< /Text>

Wanted to see what all the hipe was all about. Let me tell you from the very friendly workers and variety of drinks. The drinks are really great and are so good. Definitely will be going back. Again I would say the workers made a big impact on how the whole experience went. Dutch Bros great job. 👍< /review>

<Review>Akers location.. First time trying this place and the coffee was great, the atmosphere and customer service was awesome. You can tell this company treats their employees well, everyone was just so happy. I will be back again for sure.

First time to try their coffee, it's different it doesn't taste like other coffee shops and that's fine I really enjoyed my drink it was really good. Staff was nice, they were listening to music while working seems they were enjoying their atmosphere.<//review>

<text>Frap was good. Used the drive through they come up to the car to take your order. I don't like that because it puts them in my bubble but they are able to answer questions and since the approached before i got to the menu board it helped< /text><user>107415153942100444447<//user>< Resp>

<Text>I was a lil upset. The employee took my order while in line but l got behind a truck who got what l think was their order but they kept waiting, talking with staff, after 8 minutes l left. I should have asked an employee what the hold up was but didn't.

I'm such a Converse fan! They have great styles at this location, and I really enjoy the customer service. When I was buying shoes for my 12 and 14 year old daughters, my 12 year old wanted a pair of Hello Kitty Chucks. They were just in, so they were not part of the sale. I did not want to spend $60 for a pair of shoes for my 12 year old, especially because I typically don't buy shoes that much for myself. So, a rep. by the name of Kimberly helped us significantly by showing us a pair of Chucks that were similar in color but at least half the cost! My daughter really liked the shoes, and I really liked the price!

Tanner helped my other daughter, and he was so patient. He walked to and from the back multiple times to help us find the right pair of shoes. I already like the styles they offer but to have great customer service on top of that always helps the shopping experience.

I'll continue to stop into the store and see my Converse peeps😊!</Text>

Horrible Horrible Service. Employees are a joke , you had one crippled one that you felt bad for because she sitting there then when she gets up you realize she needs cruches ! Her friend who ended up being an employee laughing making jokes about customers being beavers. Horrible customer service in this place. Never left a store soo upset.<//Review>

<UserId.>116100427622543080175<//UserId.><text>Always great burgers. I think they changed their bread supplier because the buns, although fresh, were a little 'chewy'. Not as easy to bite through. Probably sounds petty, but caused the burger/cheese/onions/lettuce to slide out on each bite. I will still go back, love their food, staff is always excellent!!</text>< gmapID>

That jalapeno burger was amazing. Flavor and texture balance was spot on. Spiciness medium+, which felt perfect.</Text>

<Text>Ordered the mushroom burger. Burger was very good. I'm upset with the price. Menu states the combo is $10.99 yet I was charged $12.47 plus tax. When I questioned the price the young lady politely told me that was after tax. If that is after tax why was my total $13.44? Tax on $10.99 is 85 cents, I should have only paid $11.84. I was charged $1.60 more, paying $13.44. Very disappointed and most likely won't be back and definitely won't be recommending J's Burgers.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80ecc54231df1e51:0x238fb96b2642bfaf</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ngl this place was the equivalent of a 5 star,  Gordan Ramsay, five guys. From the buns to the holy sauce, this place is great for a non-traditional fast food burger.</Text>

Massive burger!  Picked up burgers for the fam tonight.  I have to say it's damn good!  Burgers are huge.  Almost too big and I'm a big eater.  I have the western burger.  Large beef patty and very juicy.  Fresh made onion ring and thick cut bacon really sets this burger off.  Even the fries are hand cut.  I will definitely come again.< /review>

<username>George Castro<//username><text>Arguably.. the best burger in town. The double cheese burger was outstanding.. the fries were hot, crispy and seasoned.. a must try when in the mood for a burger.

<review>This place is like one of those hidden gems among the small burger joints that you stumble upon and once you taste the difference - you're hooked and you come back for more. They have the tastiest freshest burger and fries I have had for a longetime. They make everything fresh and from scratch. No Frozen patties used and you can definitely tell in in the taste of the Ortega burger Combo Special- that's what I had.  It came with a fresh basket of fries like IN-n-Out style but  with a more generous portion and a drink for a bargain price of $9.95 plus tax. The burger size was certainly on the big size. I'm coming back for sure.</review></record></dataset><record>

Yeah, this place rocks. Obviously you aren't here for the atmosphere, you're here for the burger, and this one is superior. Excellent toasted bun, fresh toppings, good, flavorful beef. The fries were crispy and the portions substantial. Seems like the garlic on them was slightly sauteed, instead of the usual raw garlic bite.
Wish I could have tried the milkshakes, but I was stuffed with the burger and fries. Glad I didn't get an extra pattie, despite the quality.

The restaurant is kind of hard to spot in the dark, unless you know what you are looking for.</Text>

Good burgers as usual, but minus one star for service with an apparent two-faced, bi-polar attitude. We waited about 5 minutes before anybody noticed us. Cashier finally came out of the kitchen after chatting with the cook, and was  very pleasant when we first came in, but after we paid for our order, she went back into the kitchen and was talking and laughing with the cook again. Not a word about where to wait, just that she would let us know when it was ready. When she came back in a few minutes, and saw we were still standing there, and rather abrasively barked at us to "Hey! wait outside, we can't just have people waiting around in here. Covid, you know." After  stepping outside, we saw a customer who had  been sitting outside at a patio table come in to request a drink refill and the cashier not only served him immediately, but chatted with him for 2-3 minutes after. A warning to all: if you order takeout here, be prepared to step outside IMMEDIATELY after ordering or you will get chewed out. The cashier was  pleasant again when she brought our order, spouting compliments,  but that was little recompense for her attitude earlier. I agree with supporting local small business, but I do NOT agree with poor treatment of customers, and attempting to patronize  them afterward as if nothing happened.< /Review>

Atascadero Location review...
Great local burgers and shakes! Very tasty! A little more burger joint style decor interior would give a 5 star rating from me! Great burgers nonetheless!...

Visited the Paso Robles location Sunday June 09, 2019... Nothing like the Atascadero Location at all. Hard to believe it's under the same name.
Very dirty, floors n tables were very sticky. It seemed all but the Coke was out. Fries were very soggy and greasy. Burgers were dry and over cooked. Veggies however, were fresh. Buns were dry and almost stale.< /Text>

For about $8 you can get a single cheeseburger, fries, and a drink. A drive thru quarter pounder meal costs more than that. Despite constant mixups with orders delivered to the wrong table, the food arrived quickly. I would have to guess J's Burgers is trying to emulate the Double-Double folks with the style and ingredients on the burgers. Includes shredded lettuce, tomato, and onion. The difference is J's uses their own sauce, which is tasty, but a bit watery. (makes a mess by the time you get to the end of the burger). The fries are shoe string thin, way too greasy, and don't taste very good, just like the other guys. Limited soda fountain drinks.
They also offer kids meals, chicken sandwiches, onion rings, and milkshakes.
Convenient location on Spring Street with a tiny parking lot shared with the shoe store everyone loves to hate.
Open late-ish compared to other locally owned places.<//Review>

<Review>How could you beat this place? The food is fantastic and the prices are absolutely ridiculously cheap. The potatoes are fresh cut in front of you and the burgers are hand pressed. The food is always delicious and the wait time is minimal. I seriously don't think there is a better deal to be had as far as Burger chains go.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

GREAT burger and fries, I am not kidding! Just a little joint,  order at the counter kind of place but WOW! You can see the kitchen from the counter and that's when you know it's going to be good...the burger patties are fresh, not frozen, and hand formed , you don't see that much anymore.  The fries, what can I say, except awesome ...thin hand cut and cooked to perfection and if you like garlic, I highly recommend the garlic fries but be aware that they are very garlicky,  I love that the garlic has a hint of vinegar with gives a nice tang. Go, you won't be disappointed!< /text>

Great burgers and fries! Like an upgraded in-and-out! One star deducted though because of the atmosphere and the bathrooms.  Could have been a bit cleaner on the whole.< /text>

So I used to love this place.  But now I'm going to have to not eat here.  We ordered 1 cheese burger 1 double cheeseburger.  But to our surprise they where not cooked still mooing they where that raw.  The fries where trash cold as in ice cold.  I'm just done with J's sad to say<//Review>

Good food with decent prices. I travel alot and always look for the mom and pop shops to eat at and usually the prices are a little steep for what you get and food is mediocre. However J's burgers is very good and you definitely get your money's worth. I stop in here often since I'll be in this city for 3 months.< /Text>

I can't recommend this place enough. It's a hidden gem in Paso Robles. There burgers are high quality, and the fries are fresh cut.

I still prefer Sylvester's, but they are more expensive. J's sits in the gap between them and In n Out.

These guys have the best burgers in Paso. Skip Bronco burger and Good Ol' Burger and come here instead.</review>

No frills eatery for the burger lover. Fresh beef, fresh hand-cut fries and no disappointment. Traditional burger place that also does a chicken sandwich and salads. Made fresh to order, with a nice patio under a heritage oak tree. Prices are VERY reasonable and service is quick. No gimmicks, just honest food executed perfectly.<//review>

Nothing special. Burger was big, and greasy, if you like greasy burgers this place is great. On the expensive side. And lets face it, for $15 you can get a way better burger in Paso at one of the fancy restaurants.</text>

<review>I was shocked by the low price, this being the best burger in A-town. Great garlic fries subbed into my meal at no extra cost! Monstrous double cheeseburger! Clean tables, restroom, and drink/condiment area. My only complaint is that they allowed someone to solicit me while I sat, waiting for my food. Policy change needed!<//review>< time>

<review>My fiancé and i were looking for local spots that were delicious but weren’t stupidly expensive. We asked for lots of recommendations and kept getting the same places. Then we got recommended this while visiting Chronic winery and it was the perfect fit. The burger was delicious and the garlic fries were exactly what we needed. Simple, cheap, and delicious!<//review>< username>

Good prices on good burgers. There is a lot of bread on the Buns to make the burger look a little bigger than it is but nevertheless it's still a pretty good burger for the price. Good and friendly staff place is clean and pretty noticeable from the road going down El Camino.</text>

<text>I have been here twice and both times the burgers were great! I tried the garlic fries also and they are tasty, nice you can sub them for reg fries. They place gets busy but serving time is only about 10-15 minutes. The place could use Satellite TV, hmm where can they get DISH?

Try this place you will like it.<//text><Rate>4<//Rate></record>

DONT get the garlic fries. Burger is good, sort of like In and Out, great value. But the garlic fries are this disgusting inedible soggy bag filled with raw garlic. It was so gross. How could they take something that sounds so good and produce something so horrible?! I'm still not over it.< /review>

I am a grill cook and deli master in this area, just moved to Paso the other day. My wife and I decided to check this place out. I have one word to describe the burger I had:
YUMMY!

<Review>Very good for a quick stop fast food style. Like the chains but better ingredients. They said hamburgers were handmade daily.< /Review><Rating>4< /Rating>< Gmap_id>

Had my first J's burger tonight. Cheeseburger with bacon and avocado. Best homemade taste ever and the bacon was wonderfully thick and flavorful. Fries were very good also but maybe a tad over seasoned. All in all very good for the price. We will return!!</Text>

Small hole-in-the-wall burger joint next to Takkens. Small menu, mostly burgers & fries. I've visited twice and ordered a double cheeseburger each time, and they were both absolutely delicious. The service was good and they cooked the food fast. As of April 2016, the double cheeseburgers are only $4.85, about the same price as fast food but infinitely tastier. If you're looking for a real, hand pressed burger but don't want to spend a lot, this is the place. Will keep coming, and would recommend to anyone.</review>

The prices are really good. I wasn't too impressed by the burger I ordered, but the rest of the food was pretty good. The environment in doors isn't too special either. Good place on a budget though.<//Text>

Went to this J's burgers expecting the same service as the Santa Maria one that now has closed. Well there is no comparison. Tables were very dirty. Asked them to clean table and it went from very dirty to just dirty. Place is in pretty bad shape. Food was good,but couldn't get passed all the black bugs on the ceiling lights,walls dirty,tables dirty and kids high chairs black from where toddlers usually touch. I needed to use resteoom, but after seeing how they had there place so diety I figured restrooms were worst and my hands were cleaner not being washed than walking in there to wash them. Staff is very unwelcoming and seemed bothered when I asked them to clean a table for me. Wish the Santa Maria one was still here, that place was always clean and food was always freah.< /Review>

<review>I couldn't ask for a better cheeseburger, it really is very close to perfect. The fries are a single fry style similar to Inn and Out fries, good but not my favorite as they are overly oily. I didn't like the onion rings very much, they tasted a little under done. In my opinion they need to work on the decor inside, its very basic and creates an unpleasant mood if you're eating in. Overall its a great small town burger joint and I'll certainly return although I will phone my order in for pick up.<//review>< Pics>

Review is purely for french fries, which are quite good and a really good quantity to price ratio. Overall one of the best french fries in Atascadero though you'll usually have to wait a bit for them compared to a place like in-and-out.<//Review>

<text>Great burgers. Nice staff. This isn't a fast food burger, it alwayse seems to have that nice, fresh, "home-made" flavor. I dont go to many burger places because they are usually bland and disappointing. But ill never turn down a J's burger.  P.S.  theyr burgers with bacon added takes their great burgers to a whole new level. The bacon is alwayse cooked like bacon so you get that perfect soft crunch rather than the chewy strips most places use.</text>< Response>

<review>Don't place an order by phone you will still have to wait in line. Terrible customer service at the register {a rude "cow girl"} I waited 20 minutes in line to get my food that had already been sitting on a cold counter top from before I had even arrived..by the time i got my food it was stale cold when I asked about my food being cold I was told "no you're good" I thought the purpose of placing an order by phone was so you don't have to wait in line, you could get your food wile its still hot and then get out of the way. The food is cheap but isn't good enough to go back after this little experience.< /review><username>Lol Lol<//username><UserId.>101679274336782852871</UserId.><time>1472941141772</time>< GmapID>
