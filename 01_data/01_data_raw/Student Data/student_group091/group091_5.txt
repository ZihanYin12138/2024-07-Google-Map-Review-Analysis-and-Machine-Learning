After Omar just told us that he is changing the way deli operates. We get the wrong sandwich. Not sure if I am willing to keep giving this place my money.< /text>

Stopped in for sandwich for supper/lunch next day. For a $13 foot long, Kinda disappointing. The wheat bread was too crispy on the outside, and there was less meat/cheese than a foot long at Subway, not to mention more $. It was made correctly, 12" on wheat,  Pastrami & Provolone -lettuce and mustard only - mayo.<//review>

Cancelled order for 5 mins cause nobody could find my order.  Ended up just giving me partial refund in cash lol. Total time 45 mins.

Here's my very in depth review of DD. The first time my husband and I are here it was fairly new and unfortunately the sandwiches we got that day were not great. Neither of us were impressed. The bread was really dry and they were just very meh. However, I definitely like to give second chances and since the place was new I went back months later with my son. This time it was very good. Had a chef salad and my son a turkey sandwich. We both agreed we'd be back. I have been here three times since. The food is good. The service is ok. It's never blown my mind. Almost every time there's been a mistake of some sort. One worker also tried to sway me away from certain things I was thinking about ordering which I thought was weird.. and we've waited long times for our order when the store was very slow. I can forgive all these things because the food is tasty. There's one big problem  with this place though. One that will prevent us from eating here on a regular basis and that's the prices. They are ridiculously expensive. How in God's green earth does a sandwich combo and one medium sandwich with a cup of soup cost $36? Two meals at a sandwich shop cost me almost $40. I can't justify blowing that kind of money very often on a lunch place.</text>

<Review>The sandwiches are good, but you need to hire more employees for busy times.  Efficiency is important in the restaurant business; add another register.  The store needs more
seating. Put some seats and umbrellas outside and that solves that!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

They recommended a vegetarian sandwich then just put meat on it. So I said sure why not turns out they forgot the meat and charged me more for the extra meat that was not there.< /Review>

It’s usually a really good place, but when ordering we had to call 4 times before even answered, and when picked up customers were yelled at and phones weren’t answered. when we got the sandwiches home they had more and less condiments then ordered and a soda was ordered and not given.< /review>

< Review>
Amazing view...... recommended to carry large lenses if you like to click magnificent view of valley....

Nice trail to hike with also with kids..... path is having stiff after 1st rest stop..... kids can go that's not a problem....

Wooden guard rails is also present in few area for safety....

Parking is not a problem, huge parking place is available in brand park.....

LA downtown is visible from the left corner....< /Review>

It was a very challenging and fun hike. There is more than enough room for parking, so if you know you're gonna challenge yourself, you can pretty much park next to the entrance of the trail. The hike is ALL uphill and the steep terrain can be very slippery and difficult to navigate. This hike is not easy by any means and nike shoes are definitely not recommended. Once at the top, you have spectacular views of the Burbank, Glendale, and Griffith park areas. This trail even leads up to Mount Thom so if you're feeling extra adventurous, check it out. I definitely recommend.<//text>

The statue of Miss American Green Cross at its trailhead is a beautiful reminder of early American reforestation history. Sculpted by Frederick Willard Potter in 1928 as a symbol of conservation movement in the U. S. and particularly Glendale to save the forests of America.</Text>

Loved the experience, there are many trail options according to your hiking abilities. Be wise which path you take. One of them is a tough one. Proper shoes are a must. Great view of the city.< /Review>

< Review>
hidden gem of a hike behind the suburbs of glendale! free parking near the library. i saw two trailheads, my friend and i took the "seven trees one." it is quite steep so beware. wear proper shoes, bring sunscreen, and water for sure! the path is dirt/gravel so can be slippery at times. the views of glendale/burbank are pretty neat! unfortunately, it was quite smoggy today. there are many forks in the road, with not too much signage. my friend and i ended up going higher up the mountain and traversed along the verdugo motorway and the brand motorway, until finally making it back to the parking lot (7 miles). more signs/maps would be helpful... we were scared we got lost a few times! there were not too many people on the trail, which was nice. also water fountains/restrooms would be great additions to the trails!<//Review>

It’s like paradise right in the city. Awesome place to hike. Couple routes easy and hard depends on your skills and goals. Great place. For kids and families too obviously with adults supervision. Don’t forget the water. Wonderful nature.</Text>

<review>Personally, after hiking the Henry Cook Lookout Point, I wasn’t too impressed by this Brand trail. Don’t get me wrong- it’s a good trail that has a great view- but the big payoff view takes too long to get to. I was looking for a shorter trail that gave me the exact same thing that this trail did. Would recommend for more avid hikers with a lot of time on your hands.</review>< Pics>

<text>It is relatively short, but hard enough if you take the left path on the way top. I recommend that you take the left way at the initial point, and take the right path - from the top it's the left one - on the way down. Not that impressive, but still wonderful scenic view of downtown LA, Burbank, and Glendale at the same time from the top.<//text>< Pictures>

Good hike but a little steep on the uphill side (going counter clockwise).  Not sure it would have been any better as a downhill though.</Review>

To be quite frank, this was quite a disappointing trail. While it markets itself as family friendly, this is clearly a trail for more avid hikers that takes much time to get to. We rate this trail hard, and we’re quite disappointed.< /review>

< review>
this is one of my favourites. it really tests your endurance. it you want to get the most out of it i recommend taking a back pack with a little bit of waight on it. 5lbs or 10. what ever you feel comfortable with. truat me you can only get better. good luck and have fun< /review>

The best threaders I have been to for 4 years now. They even pencil my eyebrows for a perfect look at no extra cost. They will take your temperature at the door. Best prices in OC.< /review>

<Text>Wouldn’t go anywhere else! Cute, simple, modern salon. Prachi knows eyebrows and she works with you to get the best shape possible. She is also super professional when it comes to waxing any areas. She takes appointments but walk ins are always welcomed. She has another person at her salon who is good too but I still gravitate to Prachi specifically. Highly recommend this salon.</Text><Date>1547963718719< /Date><username>Neha Zalavadia Shah</username></record>

Prachi was amazing for Eyebrows Threading and Making an appt. online was beyond convenient especially for my first wax . Prachi was so personable and so genuine in conversation. It's so hard to get some places on the phone and taking the time to call around can be a pain. I was able to get in the following morning. I finally found my wax lady and will DEFINITELY go back< /review>

I love to pamper myself with a nice facial every so often. It's a great way to decompress and detoxify your skin at the same time.</Review>

I absolutely love coming here. I get my upper lip and eyebrows threaded about once every two weeks. My eyebrows are a little funky shaped after I decided to pluck them myself as a teen. When I get them threaded now they come out amazing considering the damage I did when I was younger. There is an incredible attention to detail and the staff is very sweet! I don’t trust anywhere else with my eyebrows! I get to most flattering shape in my brows when I come here.</Review>

Great eyebrow threading experience! I have pretty full brows and I’m always afraid too much will be taken off, but my technician did a wonderful job cleaning them up without taking them out. She was also very kind and friendly. I’ll definitely be back!< /Review>

I found this place after long time,  with perfect threading service,  Very Clean place,  Very professional staff,  Ask first how I need my eyebrow shape and after few minutes show mirror and ask again is it ok,  I loved it.  Other places don't ask and finish eyebrows very quickly but this place is perfect.  Also I did my waxing service and they don't do double deep waxing and wax done very nicely.  I will definitely go to this place for my future beauty service.  5  🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<//review>

<Text>Today was my first time going to get my eyebrows threaded here. I went because it's super close to where I get my nails done and had a lot of good reviews. The owner Prachi did my eyebrows and she did a very good job. Her salon is very clean and they give you a discount for being a first time costumer.</Text>< pictures>

I wish I could give place negative stars. I had an appointment at 5pm and drove ALL THE WAY from Lakewood, CA to get to their Fullerton, CA location. I even got there 15 minutes early! Then the owner, Prachi, turned me away because "we have a small room and I just don't feel comfortable. Sorry." Then she gestured to my stomach. Translation: "you're fat and I don't feel comfortable working on you."

For the record, I was there for a Brazilian wax and lower leg wax. I'm 400 lbs but I'm tall enough where you really don't see much other than a slight fat roll. I'm also extremely well groomed and not smelly in any way. If you're even a little bit heavy, don't waste your time here. Actually, don't waste your time here period. European Wax Center in Long Beach Towne Centre is waaaaay nicer and doesn't judge!</Review>

<Review>I have been going to this salon for quite sometime now to get my eyebrows threaded but after today’s experience I will not be coming back nor will I be recommending this salon to anyone else.

Today I came in to get my eyebrows threaded and I was the only customer in the shop (shocker) and the employees made me wait so they themselves could thread each other’s brows first before a customers. At the time I did not mind because I was in no rush so I waited patiently. One of the ladies threaded my brows and made them uneven. Again, did not mind because not every eyebrow thread is going to be perfect. After I pay, I ask what exactly is involved in their mini-facial. The lady explains but after telling me, she ends with “but it is only for women.” Only for women? This is 2018. Maybe that should be printed on your sign if it is “only for women.” I will be gladly going to your competitor across the street that offers amazing facials to any paying customer.

Thank you for messing up my eyebrows and thank you for turning away a customer for no apparent reason! I will be sure to spread the word :)<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Really amazing place!!! I love thick eyebrows and it seems that everywhere I go they always thread them too much. The lady that did mine was sooo fantastic! She left them thick just how I like them and she was super sweet! 10/10 recommend to everyone!!! And for your first time on your eyebrows it's just $3 and a Brazilian is just $15<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

5 stars were well earned. I went near closing time and my first impression was that it was neat clean and hygienic. Secondly, Prachi asked me what I liked and delivered. She was very quick and polite and had a smile on her face the whole time. I went because of the first time customer promotion but because of how happy I am with my brows I'll be going back in a few weeks.< /Text>

Painful experience.  She seemed to be in a rush. Pulled way too much hair most of the time.  Not coming back.  If you go in, make sure you tell them it's your first time so you only $5.</text>

I love this place! This is the only place ive been getting my brows done for a while. I am very picky when it comes to beauty but I’m happy to say I could trust them with my brows. Place is always neat and everyone there is nice ! The waiting is never longer than 15 mins< /text>

<Review>We live about 5hours away. Unfortunately, because of our timing, we arrived past 10PM, when the lobby closes, at about 10:30PM. We did called same day to let them know we'd be late, and was told it'd be ok, and to ring the lobby doorbell. We had some issues contacting the hotel staff after hours; was not sure if the after-hours-doorbell was actually ringing when we pressed, and also calling the staff-phone wasn't working. After about 10minutes of pressing the doorbell, 5minutes later our phone call finally made it through, and we got checked in swiftly. So, my advice: try to arrive during lobby-open hours to avoid any issues.Our room was great. We intentionally chose this hotel for it's much lower rate compared to other sites and the great reviews we read through. Hotel is about a 10minute steady-walk to the peir; because we had a 4year old in tow, it took a little longer, and we took paths where there were traffic-light-controlled crosswalks. Otherwise, if it were just us adults, we could have arrived at the beachfront in just under 10min.Hotel is just across the way from the Pismo Beach 'Welcome' spot, for close-by access for photo-op.Room was fine - again, know what you're paying for. Bed and pillows were not horrible so as to keep me uncomfortable, or give me any body aches. As others mention, the hotel is next to a on/off ramp to the highway, but again, it didn't affect us. Overall, money wall saved/spent.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>Only needed a room for 1 night , our favorite spots were all booked.  We tried Ocean Palms and were very happy with our room.  The service was easy and quick.  Surprisingly the room was very quiet despite the freeway entrance, which is very close! Room was very clean and had everything we needed. Cute outside area to sit and eat.< /review>< Date>

This was our first stay here. The rooms are newly updated and spacious. We chose this because we didn’t want to spend $$$. It was far nicer than many hotels we have stayed in the area far more money. As long as the rates stay reasonable, we will continue to visit this diamond in the rough.  Beds are okay 6 out of 10. Roil on site, didn’t use but looked nice, coffee maker and mini fridge in room. Washer and dryer on site if needed (looked new).<//text>

The property was within walking distance to the pier and conveniently next to the freeway (you couldn’t hear the traffic from our room). We were greeted within seconds from walking  into the check-in counter, the process was extremely quick! Less than 5 min. from the time we parked to getting into our room. The room has all of the basic amenities my only gripe would be the a/c unit being underneath the table but otherwise I would definitely stay here again next time I’m in Pismo</text>

Like many motels in Pismo this one appears to cater to persons that don't plan on spending a lot of time in their room. All of the furniture was old and outdated, the rooms were cramped, the bathroom had broken tiles on the floor. There was a fairly large refrigerator in there in case you bring your own food. The coffee maker was a single cup coffee maker and was very mediocre coffee. It's free, but there is a really good coffee shop not far that I would recommend if you want something better. I feel like overall for the price it wasn't quite worth it but it was at least just a short 7-minute walk to the beach and food. So really it just depends on what you're there for. Also, the walls are thin so ya know... You'll hear a lot of things at night. If possible try to get a second story room.</Text>

<review>This hotel has a bar-b-que pit which is pretty awesome! Also, you are not near the crowds so at night it is quiet and you can sleep well, there is a freeway nearby but surprisingly I couldn't hear it, and the benefit was that I could get on and off the freeway very quickly and easily to visit the nearby outlets or California Market. Room service was clean and also you will be walking distance to everything. No need to break the bank on a room when you will spend most of your time outside enjoying the ocean weather.<//review>< Response>

Location is great. Our room was quite large. Quick check-in. Although our room seemed clean when we got in, i was VERY disappointed to find the coffee maker had old coffee pods still in the maker that were mildewing. We would definitely stay again.<//Text>

I am writing this while in my room. WIFI IS HORRIBLE!  I tried connecting with three different devices.  None of them worked.
There was no soap to wash my hands, the room smelled like mildew...Funny thing was, I didn't try wifi, until I was showered and in bed.  Then owner wanted to move me to new room. What a joke.< /Review>

<Text>We stayed here for one night on our way through the area, and it suited our need for a bed quite well. Room was fairly updated and the bed comfortable. Breakfast would have been nice but it wasn’t advertised so we didn’t expect it. Our only complaint was very low water pressure in the shower and not very hot water in the water. We would not choose this place for a lingering stay, but for just a night and place to stay it suited our needs well.<//Text>< rating>

I was very pleasantly surprised with this hotel. I pulled up very late, 11:30, but the manager still met me with the night buzzer and I got my key within a minute. The room was much nicer than I was expecting, clean and new furniture and construction. And at such a good price. I'll be stopping here again when I'm in the area.< /Review>

Hotel is very easy to find and in a great location. Just a few minute quaint walk to the sand, it lies blocks from Pomeroy and the Pier (great for avoiding crowded and frustrating parking situations). We booked the afternoon of check-in, and had no issues when arriving at the front desk. It was a bit late, so we were met with short conversation.

The room was surprisingly more upscale and clean than I originally gathered from other pictures and reviews. The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows felt like clouds. The King Bed room had a mini fridge (useful with leftovers), and a nice Vizio TV. The bathroom amenities were clean and upscale.

Having lived in the area for many years previous to this visit, this is a place I will definitely be staying again. Can't beat that ocean air! We were also lucky enough to see some bioluminescent phytoplankton glowing in the sand and waves at night, which of course is awe inspiring!< /Text>

Stay here only if you could not find accommodation anywhere else. I paid about $70, 1 bed for 1 night and felt like paid too much. No AC, only wall heater and a table fan. The non-smoking room smelt like somebody smoked there before. Towels did not feel fresh, had some smell.<//text>

<text>I asked for extra towels since we had been at the beach and I like to make sure we all get cleaned up good and the staff asked me how many people were with me... I booked the room for 2 adults. I have a 3 year old and an almost 5 month old. This was ridiculous; I already paid for the room, and you’re seriously not going to give me an extra damn towel. Wow. And then, there were ants all over the bathroom, coming through the window. Gross.  The bed was clean, but the floor was disgustingly filthy, after showers, my daughter’s feet, my feet and my husband’s feet were all black... so frustrating.  Also, the floor was super uneven, majorly outdated carpet, light fixtures and wallpaper. It just frustrates me when you pay money to stay somewhere and they won’t give you a towel, and then their rooms dirty.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>I just stayed at the hotel this weekend, I discovered a bed bug crawling on my pillow. I killed it and put in a ziploc bag. I gave it to the front desk along with showing them a picture of stains on a pillow of what appeared to be bed bug markings. The owner was surprised and kept apologizing said he was very sorry and agreed to refund me for the night, when I come to find out he is only returning the early check in fee. It was room 111. This trip is costing me so much more to have to care appropriately for all my belongings that were in contact to that room along with having to treat my dogs. The cost to replace items and care for them accordingly to not bring the bugs home is so much more and they couldnt even return my fees for my night stay. Very shady business do not stay here. I will be reporting them to the health department.<//review>< Pictures>

I didn’t get the room I paid for. No apology just blamed their servers.  Guests next door up until 1 in the morning outside my room with no help from management to get the situation under control. Look elsewhere.</Review>

<Text>KEEP YOUR BLINDS CLOSED ON YOUR WINDOW! THERE IS CAMERAS EVERYWHERE AND THE CREEPY OLD MAN WATCHES THEM. My fiancé and I had different rooms due to me have my cousin with me. No one was in the hall ways/outside and when I went to her room to visit my fiancé and baby it was less then a minute and a half before the old man called the room and said she only had her down to be in the room and made me leave. So keep your blinds closed because who knows what else he is watching.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Walking distance to the beach and some very nice restaurants. The pool was unheated but clean. No breakfast but each room has a fridge, microwave, coffee maker and pods. Small hotel (22 rooms) run by one fellow. Enough parking. The biggest challenge was that the freeway on-ramp was right past the street entrance to the parking lot, so we had to drive around the block to go left.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

HOWEVER, of numerous hotels I've travelled, I've never had to pay $25/night PER PET.
Two nights turned into an extra $100 to have my two corgi sized dogs stay. That's ridiculous.

It's not luxurious or anything, but it is a comfortable, quiet, relaxing stay, at least it was for my last 2 visits. Really close to the beach and most importantly, it was clean. I would definitely go again. The rates are decent so there is no reason not to. Wished I was there now to be honest.</review>

Adequate, clean accommodations a few blocks from the beach in Pismo Beach. It’s obviously no 4-star hotel, but it was a good base for us to sleep and shower as we explored California’s Central Coast. Recommend.</Review>

We stayed at the Ocean Palms Motel a week ago and was very pleased with this place. The room was clean and simple and the bed was very comfortable. they provided a fan in the room since there is no air conditioning which was appreciated. Bob at the front desk was very nice and helpful. This is a great location and close to downtown and beach. We will definitely be staying here again. Thanks Bob!< /Review>

<Review>Very very rude staff. Booked with them for a weekend stay; couldn’t hardly get ahold of anyone at front desk for any questions I had BEFORE my stay. Would be very rude and say to call back at a later time and they wouldn’t speak to me. Ended up canceling and going through a different hotel stay. I will never book with them again.< /Review>< Response>

<Text>Owners are very polite and accommodating. After searching for this place on Google and reading that they offered a continental breakfast I was relieved. (Seeing as I have 3 kids with me breakfast in a motel room isn't the easiest and eating out gets expensive fast.) Then come to find out once we get here that no breakfast exists! It's ok we made it work. Rooms are clean, neat with no build up of gunk behind the dressers or under the bed. Water pressure and temperature were working perfect. Some of the rooms don't have an a.c. unit but they provide a fan in those rooms. Pool was too cold to even look at... satisfied stay for sure. We look forward to staying again soon.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80ec58deaa2d1e8f:0xedf139fdaa4796f4<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Location is wonderful. It is a quick walk to the beach and many tasty dinings. The rooms of the motel were very clean. It was very unexpected how nice the motel was. The only issue was that the shower in our room only output warm water. This made for an uncomfortable morning shower. Service was responsive even though we had arrived late at night. Check in was smooth and simple.< /Review>

<Time>1533075525599< /Time><rating>3< /rating><Review>My dad stayed here while visiting me, so the kiddo and I spent some time with him at the motel. It was a decent place. The bed was insanely tall. I almost brought a stool over for my dad to make getting in and out of bed easier.  Room was pretty clean. Bathroom was pretty claustrophobic. Pool is great, but damned chilly.  My dad really didn't care for the fact that the continental breakfast is surrounded by burning incense. Nothing against incense, it is just not pleasant around food. All and all, good little motel for a beach town stay, if you aren't looking for many ammenities.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

The motel has a convenient location and walking distance from the beach. The room was clean and reasonable. Breakfast was minimal but nothing bad about it! We just stayed one night during our road trip to San Diego. Service was good in our experience. I would stay here again if I had to.< /review>

Arrived for 4th of July and had no problem signing in at the front. They were kind and quickly got me into my room. Despite the lack of parking throughout Pismo, they kept the lot on lock down so I was able to easily grab a spot. The room was immaculate and the bed was very comfortable. It looked as if it had been recently remodeled. I highly recommend.<//Text>

Pretty nice hotel, wasn't too expensive and a close walk to the beach.  No view of the ocean but you can't  really expect one for the price.  They offer a continental breakfast but we didn't take advantage.  Electric outlets accessible from the beds, WiFi wasn't fast but was usable.  Rooms have the NFC key cards you just tap, which isn't a big deal but makes me feel cool.< /review>

The brown man at the front desk could have been nicer. I told him, "good morning" and he ignored me.
Customer service makes a difference. I certainly am not coming back here.
We weren't told that the heater didn't work in the room. No air ventilation in the bathroom is no no also.</Text>

Supposedly pet friendly but upon checking was told they are not!  However their pet friendly policy was posted right on the wall.  He questioned me about size of dog and if I had a cage.  He said fine just this one time.  Fee is excessive in my opinion. $20 per pet per night!<//Review>

< Review>
Small motel within walking distance of the beach and downtown. We loved the room and only had two issues. No air conditioning, which is probably not that important this close to the beach. And the breakfast was another issue. Funny tasting milk and no bagels. But there are really good breakfast opportunities within walking distance, so again probably not really an issue.
All in all a good place to stay if you like soft fluffy beds. 😀</Review>

AMIT PATEL PROMISED HE WOULD GIVE US OUR MONEY BACK IF THE TRANSACTION WAS STILL THERE AFTER 24 HOURS. MMM VERY CONVENIENT AS WE WERE TRAVELING BACK TO AUSTRALIA THE NEXT DAY.
THIS WAS 9 WEEKS AGO. I CONTINUED TO CONTACT HIM REGARDING THE TRANSACTION. ALL TO NO AVAIL.

< Review>
My husband and I stayed at the Oceans Palms for our anniversary weekend . It really was not what we had hoped for. The room had no air conditioning and was stuffy when we arrived. Luckily a fan was provided which helped some. The lock latch on our room was broken which we notified the manager but did not show concern. This place when we booked online said it had breakfast which is false . They didn't.  Check in isn't until 3pm and they don't let u check in any sooner even though it was already 230 when we got there. Pool there is ok but we will not be going back to Ocean Palms again

Contacted today 3/09/17 for a room tonight. Woman answered and after conversing for a moment passed the phone to her husband. I repeated what i went over prior about the room i was wanting to book. Extremely rude man doesn't even answer me and all this time I can hear his wife speaking Hindi in the background for a few minutes, I say hello is anyone there and he hung up on me. I called back, he refused to acknowledge this and argued with me while raising his voice and  i am still just trying to book a room. I told him.it was very obvious that they did not want customers and I would be seeking business elsewhere. I do not recommend staying here if they are this rude over the phone.<//text>

This hotel is extremly BASIC for the price. There is no AC its very warm and stuffy. They provided a portable fan with little access to plug it in. The plug ins were all striped so out phone chargers kept falling out. The bathroom was just a small shower with a creepy window in it. Over all not worth the price.  Way to hot and uncomfortable.</Text>

Breakfast is not worth it. The guy at the front desk never smiles. Room was ok but no air-conditioner or hair dryer.

Where to start, first off there is no breakfast. At All! There website said there was, which I checked before and after checking into the hotel. The pool also claims to be heated. I called the morning before I arrived and was told it was between 72-78 degrees. It was not at all. Traveling with an young daughter looking forward to a warm pool is not ok. Not having breakfast is not ok. I paid more to stay here based on these things and was totally dissapointed. So I had to pay to eat at a restaurant.<//Review>

My review is of the staff. When I checked in for our reserved 2 bed room, The front desk person asked how many people.  I stated 3 people.  I gave my ID and credit card. Then he swiped my card without explanation.  I asked isnt the room paid already?  He said its for incidentals.   He gave me one room card.  I had to ask for the second one.  When we checked out, I asked for a receipt.  It happened to be the same person at he front desk and he told me it is emailed through expedia  and would not give me a receipt.  I checked my account the next day and saw they charged me an extra $10.  BEWARE the base room rate is for 2 people and $10 extra per person.  They charge me for 2 extra persons when it should of been one.  Dishonesty!<//Text>

The best place to stay and a little expensive but totally worth it, it was only a 8 minute walk to the pier. The best part of pismo beach the bread bowl clam chowder was the best, and I can't wait to come back!</review>

< review>
Fire alarm in our room kept on going off through the night, announcing (in a synthesised voice) it was low on battery. Did some research and this brand does this several months after the hotel was meant to have changed the battery. Mentioned this to to owner in the morning and they laughed, given that their main purpose is to provide a safe, good night's sleep and they failed to provide either, cannot recommend.</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Quiet and classic motel with every comfort. The peculiarity is that it is very close to the main piers, so the pre-dinner walk and the return at late sunset are obligatory, with the backdrop of the Californian colors. Honest price and very convenient parking.

(Original)
Tranquillo e classico motel con ogni confort. La particolarità é che è molto vicino ai moli principali, quindi d obbligo la passeggiata pre cena e il ritorno al tramonto inoltrato, con lo sfondo dei colori californiani. Prezzo onesto e parcheggio comodissimo.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Wonderful motel near the highway - yet quiet and the beach is 10 minutes walk away. Room was big enough and you can tell that the motel is run personally. Rooms under the roof are dependent on the climate. Beds are comfortable and Kingsize big enough. Gladly again.

(Original)
Wunderbares Motel in der Nähe des Highways - dennoch ruhig und der Strand ist in 10 Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen. Zimmer ausreichend groß und man merkt, dass das Motel persönlich geführt wird. Zimmer unterm Dach sind aber auf die Klima angewiesen. Betten sind gemütlich und Kingsize ausreichend groß. Gerne wieder.< /text>

Takes forever for someone to help u here , also I got a phone on a plan here long ago and when I leased it they said I can return at any time no problem and no charges  ,so after I got tired or paying the high bill I wanted to return the phone to them so I could get off the contract and they told me I couldn't and I had to pay the phone off before giving it back , then said I have to pay for getting off the contract , I was waiting for over an hour or more and the worker helping me says he can't do anything for me an to go to another TMobile ,....
. Save your money and go to metro , cheaper then paying for a high priced piecee of plastic on a 2 year contract on a phone u can't even upgrade<//text>

I’ve  been going to this store for about two years, and they’re always very friendly and helpful. Veronica helped me with some recommendations for products and hooked me up with some good deals. Also, when they had to order my phone it’s arrived really quick. Overall, everyone at this location make the whole experience convenient and comfortable.<//Text>

HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE !
The people with five stars probably only got good customer service because they went into the store.. BUT I CALLED THIS STORE (LAST WEEK) and A MAN ANSWER .. He DIDN'T even GREET ME with THE RIGHT INTRODUCTION HELLO (( " THIS IS THE SPRINT STORE .. HOW MAY I HELP YOU" )) HE ANSWERED with a HELLO and he didn't even state his name .. i told him my issue he listed my options and his tone wasn't so GREAT EITHER and i told him I WOULD CALL BACK IN A HOUR OR TWO TOO THINK OVER MY OPTIONS .. and all of a sudden .. (HE HUNG UP RIGHT IN MY FACE) HE LUCKY I DIDN'T DRIVE UP THERE TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER .. GET BETTER !< /text>

<Time>1578993661502</Time><review>They are very nice, but are incapable of setting up a new account and process anything correctly. So far my account was started then a new number/acount was created when I ordered a new phone. So my friends referral bonus for bringing me to Sprint was canceled on his and my side. Then they were not capable of activating the tracker I bought. I exchanged it once and it took another month and the return process for someone to see it was never activated. Horrible technical service. They have no idea what is going on. This store is a scam. Not sure if all Sprint locations are the same, but at this store, Veronica and German will try to scam you with a smile.< /review><resp>None</resp>< username>

The staff is very knowledgeable about the devices as well as the plans and all the promotions there  is. They hook it up with the best discounts why go anywhere else they will get you all set up for a good price.  I would definitely recommend this store to anyone looking for the  best deals.</text>< GmapID>

If I could give a minus they would have earned it.  4 useless people in an empty store.  Took my phone to this store @345pm.  2 people in line. 1 person exchanging a phone the other getting a refund.  I had a phone needing repair.  Tech. standing in the back  staring in the sky.  The rude girl who was not helping me...told me it would be 1 hr.  I said there is no one in here.  She said that's how long it takes.  I said how do you know, it has not been looked at.  She said I don';t have to help you...told her you are not.  Customer service is none existent in this wilderness.  When that store closes..which will be soon..4 more for minimum unemployment benefits.  Young people without a college education or any professional training will always be underemployed.  Save yourself a trip and go to Temecula or Moreno Death Valley.< /Review>

I will recommend this store to everyone. The manager and the tech guy Jose went above and beyond. It is the first time ever I have left a phone company smiling. Will be getting my sister to leave Verizon after 16 yrs to come to this store only. Shame on Apple Store.... they Clearly do not have the customers best interest top of the list.Sprint at the Best Buy ... thumbs down. This store will not leave you dissapointed.... you guys ROCK :-)<//Review>

<Review>I love going to this Sprint store they are awesome. They have a wonderful, knowledgable staff as welll as a good service center to get your devices fixed. One of the managers Wilson was able to save me $30 a month from what I was already paying for just bundling up my service no catch no extra fees. I did not think it was possible. Anyone who has sprint or is interested in sprint go to this store you will not regret it.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dca137eb38aa2d:0xbeaebc43ac544978<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Went into the new store next to cardenas, its alot more spacious and cleaner. I was greeted by every employee in the store. About a 10 minute wait to be helped. Once it was my turn, I asked if there was anyway to lower my monthly plan, Karina pulled up my account and seen that there was a mistake from when I tried to change my plan on the Sprint customer service line. She was able to lower my plan by 30 bucks. and told me that my next upgrade will be in March. I am definitely going to come back here for my next upgrade.<//review>

Came down from the bay area and walked into the perris sprint store. Worked with Garreth and he hooked me up! awesome package deal on accessories, and got me into a new S7 edge and I couldnt be happier. Found out it was his first day at this store...do not wait! get in there and let him hook you up!!<//Text>

Purchased some phones and came back to sign up for my 200 promotion card. Per Store manager was going to be helped by any of the employees at the store. Had to deal with Jeremiah who was rude. To bad can’t leave the stars at zero because that’s what I would have rated his customer service.<//review>

<Text>The sales associate Adilia preordered a phone for me and put the wrong payment type for the phone in the system. I was put on a lease plan instead of a 24 month payment plan, after I told the sales lady I was not interested in leasing a phone. Sprint customer service is no help and the only way to try and resolve the problem is to go back to the store that caused the problem.  Sprint needs to go back to using computers to order phones instead of using tablets that do not allow the customer to verify what is being done is correct.</Text>< pics>

They had to run my card over the phone at through a different store in Colton. I was "accidentally" double charged. Then was told it was fixed, I was lied to. Take only cash. You can't trust them. They'll steel your money, literally.<//Review>

Ellos te dicen que vas a pagar una cantidad y hablas a Costumer Service y ya te dicen la verdad cuánto es lo que vas a pagar una cantidad diferente a lo que te dicen allí donde agarrar los teléfonos puros mentiras asegúrense en bien de lo que les están diciendo que se los compreven con papeles porque siempre dicen que un teléfono gratis y ahí te sale que te lo están cobrandoY luego te sacan dinero de tu tarjeta sin avisarte sin mandarte un vil primero</review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Pity service in this store I have been with them for about five months and it hurts attention in the store. Last Sunday the manager left us talking alone because he is very busy. To sell cell phones they are friendly but to help you with an invoice problem, quite the opposite, so with apologies in advance I tell you if you do not like the work you do, do not do it.

(Original)
pesimo servicio en esta tienda llevo aproximadamente cinco meses con ellos y lastima de atencion en la tienda. El domingo pasado el manager nos dejo hablando solos que porque esta muy ocupado. Para vender los celulares son amables pero para ayudarte con un problema de factura todo lo contrario asi que con disculpas de antemano les digo si no les gusta el trabajo que hacen no lo hagan.<//Review>

<Text>I have a 2017 Honda Accord Sport with its original rims parked in this location on the 21st of November 2019. this day is when my vehicle was lifted and all four of my wheels were taken off from my car. No cameras at the parking lot to watch over the vehicles whereas the “PATRONS” pay for their service but still ending up getting into situations like this.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Clean Station! Train is on time!

From here, you can go to:

LAX airport by Airport Shuttle.

Santa Monica Beach/Pier by the Blue Line 3 or Rapid bus.  Rapid means express with fewer stops that are usually major intersections.

Westchester, Culver City, West LA, Westwood & UCLA by green bus 6 or Rapid bus.</Text>< UserId.>

I received a$53 parking violation. There aren't obvious signs up regarding the parking fee. I thought this was a typical Park N Ride.  Download the Metro Parking app beforehand so you're not surprised like me.</review>

ABMS shuttle service to/from LAX is very inconsistent.</text>< pictures>

Always a fantastic experience at this place.  Delicious pizzas, pastas, salads, and appetizers.  The manager is wonderful, always so friendly and knows his regular customers by name.  Love the fact that prices are reasonable and they are always offering various coupons and other deals.  Have been going here for years and will continue to do so!</Text>

This has been our go to for inexpensive pizza for a few years now but tonight we have been waiting for two and a half hours and have been told 3 times in the last 45min that it was on the way.  We live 10-15min away at best. When I called they didn't even have an excuse like " we are short handed" or "we have been very busy tonight" all they would say is "sorry, it's on the way".  So I don't know, I guess only order if you aren't hungry.

*EDITE* after another half hour I was told they don't know what happened and said they were going to make a new one at 9:40pm. I asked what they are going to offer in order to "make good" on the situation. I was told that I could have a cookie or a refund. I took the refund, I didn't want to wait who knows how many more hours. They don't seem to deliver on there own anymore and even if you order from there site they pass it off to Doordash. The problem is you don't have anyway to communicate with the driver because you didn't order through Doordash</Text>

<Review>I am a regular customer at pizza guys. I been observing this place for a while they have great prices and new deals. The store is following all covid-19 guide lines, all the workers wear mask and gloves. The store manager is really nice and always has a positive vibe around the store greets everyone nicely. I would recommend this place to everyone who’s Around Petaluma or in Petaluma.< /Review>< pics>

<review>At our office in Petaluma, many of us are on the road in the solar, storage, and electrical business.
But when we manage to be in at our desks at the same time, once or twice a week,  we become honorary "pizza guys"-the ones who are going to eat and enjoy it-and call our local Pizza Guys in Petaluma.
Responsive, customer service oriented--a consistently tasty pizza is ready right when promised.
I think it says something that the pizza-crust, sauces, and toppings- are consistently tasty, after a couple+ years.
We've tried others, but these "pizza guys"  like The Pizza Guys in Petaluma!</review><rate>5</rate><Date>1610251133346</Date></record>

Ordered via door dash pick up. Extremely kind and great customer service. Got white sauce and red sauce pizzas and they were some of the best tasting pizzas I’ve had! Will definitely be going back.< /Review>

<review>Tonight I ordered pizza from pizza guys and I  live in cotati I told the guy on the phone 3 times how I would like my order and to please make sure it will be correct well my lady went to pick it up and got all the way back home with the pizza to find that it was all wrong we specifically told them light red sauce extra cheese and a few other toppings and we get both the pizza barely any cheese on them and they were soaking in heavy red sauce so I called to speak to a manager they were supposed to remake the order and deliver it and they call me back 5 minutes later to tell me no we are not going to remake your order and we will refund your money when we didn't want a refund we wanted the pizza and they have very bad customer service and was rude about it I hope the owner sees this and does something about it as this was not my fault cause the manager was trying to make it my fault i said its not my fault that your employees can't read simple directions on making pizza I told him I will be leaving a yelp review and his response was he would try to have it removed.  We go there alot and have spent alot of money there in the past to be treated this way is very shameful.  If I could give it no stars I would but u have to put 1 very displeased tonight smh<//review>< Pictures>

This place used to be good. Too many mistakes are made now and the quality is inconsistent. I ordered 2 pizzas from them this week and they were barely edible. One of them I ordered thin crust and they gave the regular crust instead. Another one they made the wrong size so they threw in an extra small one. It was undercooked and soft and too much cheese. They also forgot to put jalapeños on one pizza. They are nice people, but need more training on how to make pizza.<//Text>

Ordered a pizza at 7:53. Called back at 8:49 and was told they didnt have any drivers. I could pick it up or have door dash bring it. I told him door dash would be great! Order still not showing up so I call at 9:44 to ask when it will be here. Guy on the phone says he shows no order. I have been ordering from these guys for two years. Service has been ok, not great, until now unless you really like your pizza after it has been mishandled and looking more like a calzone with it shoved into the side of the box. It's now 10 pm and I need to find some dinner. Never again!<//Text>

My husband and I ordered a large pizza with beef and black olives and we specifically stated that we are kosher and also both allergic to green peppers.... They gave us a pepperoni and green pepper pizza and when they brought us a new pizza which was correct, the pizza was undercooked and our desert cookie was too salty somehow< /text>

<text>I don't think I would have tried this place based upon its name, but it is solid pizza. How can I describe it? I can say the names of pizza brands I think it beats. I think you should just try it, and see if you like it as well.
I just came back here to review it again. I love this place. I get a custom pizza with thin crust (canadian bacon, black olives, jalapenos, and extra mozzarella). Their salads are also very solid. I'm trying the spinach one tonight, and it's like a BLT. So good. I had to call and change my order from takeout to delivery tonight, and they didn't even flinch.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Been ordering for awhile now.  Have not had anything from here that I did not like. Staff is very courteous and friendly also.  Came in during work and they gladly refilled my thermo flasks with cold tap water on a very hot day (I work outdoors all day).  This is my new favorite pizza place.<//text>

Very nice staff and I appreciate the effort they put into making there pizzas! 100% 5 stars been here multiple time never to disappoint. I would recommend Califorina Garlic Chicken or the Bufflo Chicken Pizza They have a sweet lunch deal a drink and a two topping small! Well worth it!</text>

<text>I ordered the Tuscan Chicken pizza on two different occasions.  The menu claims fresh cut Roma tomatoes as one of the toppings.  Not one single piece of tomato, either time.  Could not taste or smell any parmesan either, and I'm unusually good at making out ingredients just by tasting or smelling a meal.  They never mentioned to me that they were out of tomatoes, they just didn't put them on the pizza.  The menu also claims "Creamy White Garlic Sauce" as a topping.  No such thing on my pizza this time around, and the time before they did add sauce, but very little. Because of this, the pizza is rather dry and not very flavorful.</text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Walked in here at like 10 on a Saturday night, hungry as hell. I saw the "MUNCHEEZ" on the side list (jalapeño poppers) I asked if they would put those on a pizza for me, Kyle was working and hooked it up! As pizza joints go this place is the bomb< /Review>

<Date>1615664534484</Date><text>I have never paid for a haircut above $50 in top rated Korean salons NJ, GA, and TX. After I moved to California, I was surprised at the salon prices in California. I finally made the choice to bite the bullet about a $70 haircut and made an appointment at Arianna.

The salon was very empty on a Monday afternoon, which I appreciated. The shampoo was so excellent that I inadvertently let out a very satisfied moan.

JJ was my stylist, and he listened to what I wanted, which was a shoulder length layered cut. While he wasn't particularly outgoing/friendly, he was super professional, checking in to see if the length was what I desired and responding to my ideas and suggestions with professional advice. He transformed my shaggy uneven cut with exactly what I had envisioned and delivered great results.

The only surprise came at the counter when I was told that the price for my haircut was $80 instead of the $70 that I had been told in advance by the receptionist. I was going to pay $80 anyway, so I didn't question the discrepancy in the prices quoted, but I wished that they had been more clear about prices up front so that I was not surprised at the end. Setting up accurate expectations and clearer communication would make this business even more excellent. Still, I am a satisfied customer and will return to Arianna.</text>< Resp>

I am sorry price wasn't what you expected. We should have been more clear about it. If that happens again, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you again and hope to see you again very soon!"}</Resp>

Made an appointment on Sunday noon and Sunny is a very experienced stylist. I am the type of person that goes with recommendations and her advice works for me! I like the layer she recommended (color was not done here) and will consider coming back again!</text>

Vivian was fantastic! I have a very unique bang cut, most stylists get confused or too timid. She was great! She cleaned them up and I am feeling great again. I will definitely be back and am making this my go-to salon from now on.</Review>

I had a haircut here recently. A bit expensive but was worth the money for their kind service and luxurious atmosphere. They also sell some PPE products like Korean masks including some cool-looking BTS masks and their TinyTan mini figures.</Review>

My hair grows fast and is difficult to cut due to weird growth patterns, but Patty takes the time to listen, make good suggestions, and then cut skillfully. I often get stopped by women asking me "I love your hair cut! Where do you get it done?" Plus, the salon is peaceful, uncluttered, and zero drama. Arrow Salon is the best!!< /Review>< Rating>

Very nice Korean ladies~ They had cute dogs running around and playing :) Although if you don't speak Korean it'll be hard to communicate with them but they do have people who speak good English.

I'm from out of town so having another Asian person cut my hair is great and they know what they're doing. Prices for guys are really affordable.< /text>

Stevie is an amazing colorist! I had the hardest time finding a colorist in the city who could make my blonde color look natural and gorgeous again. From the first visit she was able to provide my hair with the lift and brightness that it needed. This is the only salon I will go to in the future!</Review>

Brittany is a Rockstar! I am going to her for the past two years and she is amazing. She gave me a pixie cut and boy was i nervous! But she talked me through every single step of it like a friend. She is such a great stylist and a super rad and talented person. I love what she did to my hair. I have never written a review but i had to write this so that someone who is looking for a haircut please book her! Love you Brittany.<//Text>

I bought a Arianna Hair Boutique treatment from google a few weeks ago and I went over the weekend to get it done..  I saw Victor, He was nice and did a great job with my haircut.  Didn't do more than I requested.  I'm not sure how the treatment will take since it's only been 2 days since but so far I love the way my hair looks and feels!  Thanks Victor!</Text>

<review>Thank you James! I got my hair bleached and dyed to ash brown today. I am very satisfied and I will continue to have my hair done at Atlier. :)
I dyed my hair black before and it was almost impossible to turn it back. Thanks to him, it was restored!
Prices are reasonable and people are very kind.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>My friend recommended a hairstylist for me at this salon so I thought I'd give it a try.
It looks like they just opened so I was nervous about going to a new salon. However, as soon as I opened the door, I felt welcomed with smiles from the staff.
My stylist, is not only friendly but also very skillful. I really love my bob hair cut.
I'm a little hesitant to write a good review because I don't want her to get too busy to fit me in when I need a cut. That's how good she is :)
I'm very happy with my new look, thank you.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1595823223533, 'text': 'Dear Kathie, Thank you for visiting Arianna Hair and thank you for your business.

<Text>This is a follow up review for my AMAZING stylist Anita at Arrow salon. Once again, and as always she hits the target! I've especially become very fond of her color jobs. I'm always switching my hair color from one shade into the next at the whim of my mood and Anita has successfully taken me through the whole spectrum of the color wheel.< /Text><username>Amy Zahirski<//username><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2c77c747370fb:0x7124e243f46ef521< /gmapID><pics>None</pics></record>

I've been going to Arianna for the last four and I'm obsessed! She gives the best cuts and styles my hair perfectly! She's cut it short and helped me keep a cute style as I grew it out! I highly recommend Arianna Hair Boutique! She also gives a killer shampoo :)< /review>

It is a bit pricey, but honestly, it is worth every single penny.
Ever since I started to get my hair colored by Cristen, I have never received so many compliments about my hair. I honestly thought that I was just super low maintenance about my hair, but ever since I started to receive so many compliments, it truly boosted up my confidence level.<//text>

<Text>I don't normally do reviews but I have to say that I love this place. It's colorful in every sense. The atmosphere from the stylists to the music is just downright fun. The place is just amazing. My blonde highlights have taken my hair from drab to fab and the grays are a thing of yesterday. I will continue to have my hair done at this place, definitely does not disappoint!<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Cristen is my colorist and I'm so blessed to have found her. I came in with very dark brown dyed roots to midshaft and very damaged and over-processed blonde ends. She didn't even flinch, she did all over balayage highlights without touching my previous blonde.  I hadn't ever seen handpainted blonde that could look this good straight. Now, after a few balayage appointments, my dark brown is gone and she is weaving my natural color in with blonde highlights. Super low maintenance color, and I would recommend her if you want some nice hair.<//Review>

I had an excellent experience at this salon. It's very clean  and the staff Is very friendly. I have relatively long hair and Arianna took care of me with more than perfection. She helped me find the perfect color and she cut and styled my hair and it looks amazing i couldn't be happier with the results. She completely listened to everything i asked for and went above and beyond. I would recommend this place for everyone.</text>

I went to Arianna Hair Boutique and had the absolute best experience at a hair salon in years, possibly ever! If you're looking to get your hair done somewhere in Korea Town, come here! Michelle and Gina helped me, and I get a sense that everyone there is great! 💜<//review>

Jayden was fantastic for what short notice my appointment was. He took into consideration all of my preference styles and trimmed my hair to a new style! Wonderful boutique I was able to relax and pamper at while on vacation. Will come again.

Thanks for the lemon tea! Delicious!<//Review>

<Text>I went to King multiple times for coloring, balayage and cut. He's very precise throughout the whole process taking his time to understand his clients needs and gives out honest opinions and suggestions. On top of that he's a chilled guy to chat with during the long process. I highly recommend him!</Text>< Pictures>

Michelle is beyond amazing. He has taken my hair through all kinds of cuts and colors over the years. He even took me from boxed black hair dye to platinum in 4 sessions. As far as coloring goes, this man performs miracles. I also have never met anyone who can cut hair like this gal. I've seen her transform flat curls into the most model worthy victoria secret hair. Every cut she has given me fits my face so well. Michelle is a gem in this city and this salon is so cute. If you are looking for your forever hair maven... call today and make an appointment with Michelle!<//text>

Michelle is my gurrrrlll!! He's been doing my hair for over a year now, and now that he's at Arianna Hair Boutique and Third I'm so happy! Great salon, great location, great products! I always get crazy cuts and colors, which he handles like a pro, and when my boyfriend got, basically a bob, somewhere else, she corrected it and made him look great! Thanks!!</Review>

I had the BEST manicure with Swan at Cinta. She was so professional, warm and friendly and did an Amazing job on my acrylic refills. A++++ for Swan. And if I had together my hair done, I would go to Cinta as well. Their salon is great and everyone I saw who left after having their hair done looked awesome.< /Review>

I live across the street from this place and work 3 blocks away. I've always passed by and was curious about their service.

Today, I finally had time to stop by and try them out. They did not disappoint. I was helped by two people: Esther and her assistant. Between the way they treat their clients and level or service  on the hair cut that I received, saying that I am happy with this place would be an understatement.

It is safe to say that I've found a place that I can comfortably go for my hair cuts.<//Text>

<review>I can not say enough good things about Michelle. My mom flew down from Oregon to get her hair done by him b/c she loved my short hair cut so much and I always talk about how fabulous she is. She showed Michelle a photo and she went to work. The end result was exactly what my mother envisioned. And she was shocked at the price b/c she expected it to be 3 times more! Thank you again Michelle!!</review>< Pics>

<text>This place is a wonderland. Every time I go to Cinta I feel like a princess. I get my eyebrows done by Megan and I love her. I told he I wanted classic Brooke Shields eyebrows and I couldn't have been happier with the results. Also, pedicures here are like nothing you've ever experienced before. They'll change your life. Cinta is like THE one stop shop for all your grooming needs.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<rating>4</rating><review>I got my hair done by Mackenzi and she is so great.  I found her on Instagram and she did not disappoint. When I first went to her my hair was dry and so damaged by a previous salon.  After coming to her my hair looks so health and feels great.  Look at the difference.</review>< pictures>

I've been going to the owner Jina for many years, and she is very accommodating to my schedule and style requirements. If you are ever lost for style, she makes great recommendations as if it was her own hair.<//review>

I get my haircuts from Jina, and she is definitely the best hairstylist I ever had. Definitely go to her, she will able to recognize what kind of hair you have and how you can take care of it. It's also cool that she can speak English, Korean, and Japanese. Do check it out! (Mens haircut: $30)</text>

New management.  Very friendly, good food, but they no longer offer sides with the main dishes any more.   This was my favorite Korean style restaurant.  Now it’s more of a Japanese Sushi place.  looking for another Korean BBQ to get my kimchi, pickled turnip, etc, fix.  It was the sides that put this restaurant above the others.  Hopefully they will consider bringing the sides back.</review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Great place but dont come late the young staff will rush you out. Place closed at 9:30 pm but was told we couldn't order anything else at 9pm. Pretty sure this place needs all the business they can get since they are new and trying to make a name for themselves. And it's not cheap. For one person it cost me $46.00 or a couple is over $80 plus<//text><user_name>enmocean<//user_name>< date>

Everything was very fresh and the flavors were all there. The service was a little bit slow but not a big deal. I can’t wait to go back!< /Review>< pics>

Great little hidden gem of a place! It's tucked into a small business Park surrounded by neighborhoods. Wasn't very busy when we went on a Sunday evening, and the service and staff were very friendly and helpful. The portions are good size and the menu options were good.
Will definitely try this place again.<//Review>

<Review>Although this place isn't your traditional Japanese only sushi joint, but it's absolutely fantastic.  If you like a place that has a revolving set of specials, this is the place for you. If you want a place that has good deals on beer during the week, this place is for you. The staff is mostly very friendly, but they can get pretty stressed out if the place gets too busy.  One time they missed something, they apologized profusely then comped another item on the menu.

Again, not the most tradition sushi place around, but it's my favorite place to go with the spouse.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I certainly like their dishes and customer service, good area next to my house. The cashiers are always kind. Will come back again.< /Text>

<text>Tickled to have found this place! I'll have to return and try more of their menu items. It's tucked away, so it's hard to see. Service was great, place is upscale and chic, and food was simple and authentic.< /text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80e8375e0365c999:0x6250ba635e0f210e</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I kept seeing this hot stone bowl arriving at near by tables served with 8 small plates of sides.

I ordered it. The bi bim bap was very tasty and interesting. The sides likewise.

The sushi was artistic and creative. Our group like that.<//review>

Ugh, to call this place overrated (based on the reviews here) is to give it the benefit of a lot of doubt.  The food is expensive and not good. The hospitality is, uh, challenged. Lots of other fish in the sea besides this one.< /text>

<rating>5</rating><text>After hearing how good Yama San is from a few different friends my wife and I decided to go give it a try last night.  We were NOT disappointed.  Having lived in Dos Vientos for so long and seeing restaurant after restaurant come and go, I'm really hoping this one sticks around.
Kelli had their Beef Bulgogi, which is a shredded and seasoned beef served with white rice. I had the Kalbi, which is thinly sliced ribs seasoned and served with white rice as well.  Both dishes came with various side dishes, 10 of them in all.  Some of them we liked a lot, a couple we did not, and a few we thought were good.  The great thing is they are served in small sample size amounts, and they come all you can eat.  If you especially enjoy a particular one you can get as much of it as you like.  I was a fan of the potato salad and the shredded sweet radish.
I haven't tried it yet, but they also serve fresh sushi, which I have heard is excellent as well.
Please support this great local place.  I’d like to see them stick around.</text>< pictures>

The bento lunch comes with rice, miso, salad, tempura and gyoza, and everything was excellent. The chicken was cooked well and seasoned just right. It was very tender. The tempura mix was also quite tasty and not soggy, which is problem I've encountered in the past at other restaurants. The salad and rice were perfect compliments to the meal. I am very satisfied with the food and look forward to having another meal there.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80e8375e0365c999:0x6250ba635e0f210e</GmapID></record>

< Review>
I just got home from my first visit to Yama San. I was skeptical about the fusion of Korean and Japanese food, but they don't seem to have fusion dishes, just separate sections of the menu. I had dolsot bibimbap and was pleasantly surprised. It was very good. The banchan was pretty decent. We got kimchi, cucumber kimchi, pickled pearl onions, fish cakes, potato salad... And I think I'm missing something. It was definitely priced higher than most Korean restaurants ($60+ tip for two people), but I'd say that's the price of Korean food in Newbury Park, particularly in DV. Sorry, I would've taken a couple pics.</Review>

We like to stop by Denny's on El Camino Real on occasion. We try to stay away during busy times like Saturday and Sunday mornings. We like the nachos, burgers, omelets, and pancakes. When we can, we sit at the bar area or in the booths near the bar. The wait time is hit or miss, sometimes speedy and other times slow. The portion sizes are pretty large. Food prices are okay but not too cheap.<//review>

Great food, great portions, very attentive customer service. The place always seems to be clean and the wait during peak hours is minimum. Probably the best Denny's I've visited in the San Jose/Santa Clara area so far.< /text>

It's a great Denny's with good customer service. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's not above-and-beyond perfect, but the food is always served right and the place is usually very clean. It's one of my favorite locations in San Jose.<//Text>

<Review>Even with a full staff and the manager bumbling around, they managed to forget that I had even ordered my food. When they finally noticed me moving around the waiting area, they started cooking my order.
This place has been my favorite place to go for years, but over those years their staff has really gone downhill and they can't seem to find a manager that can remain professional.</Review>< Gmap_id>

It's kind of hard for me to review this place because my first experience, which was in the late afternoon and arlier in the week and it was amazin.  I ordered a new dish on the menu called Mama D's pot roast.  That was as bold move on my part because I rarely will even order a meat dish from a restaurant, unless I happen to be at Alexanders Steak House or something equivalent to that. Ok, so, to my surprise it was perfect.  The carrots & celery were cooked perfect, just the right crunch still in them.  I'm not into soggy vegetables.  The meat was tender and lean.  Very good quality and cooked perfectly.   I was sold.  I kept talking about it for days, to whoever would listen.  Now FF to last night.  I sold my friend on the idea of going to Denny's to get this amazing Mama D's dish and I had such a bad experience.  They gave me something that slightly resembled what I had ordered earlier in the weak but it tasted horrible. It was salty and soggy and they gave me the wrong flavored milkshake and well, it just spiraled downward from there.  Granted it was midnight and they were probably ready to go home or something?  Anyways, I guess I will chop it up to inconsistent.  It's a gamble, but what isn't?< /Review>

One of the best steak experiences ever! Me and my husband celebrated our 4th year anniversary here and the meal was absolutely amazing! Service was great as well, and shall I mention the incredible live Jazz band that was playing there that night? We had a great time at Harris and can't wait to visit again!<//Review>

<review>I only went in for a much needed cup of coffee. The staff was nice and quick to fill my cup, but the coffee definitely wasn't what I expected.  Dennys I feel is notorious for the oil looking, and very strong tasting coffee. I knew it as he poured it that it wasn't going to be strong, at the hour i went in and the drive I had ahead of me i was expecting that jolt but instead I received coffee that wasn't strong enough to keep me awake as I needed.  I can't comment about the food as I did not have any but if the coffee isn't going to be strong I will not be going back sorry guys.  I hope they bring back the good stuff</review>< pics>

<resp>None< /resp><text>We like to stop by Denny's on El Camino Real on occasion. We try to stay away during busy times like Saturday and Sunday mornings. We like the nachos, burgers, omelettes, and pancakes. When we can, we sit at the bar area or in the booths near the bar. The wait time is hit or miss, sometimes speedy and other times slow. The portion sizes are pretty large. Food prices are okay but not too cheap.</text>< UserId.>

Amazing delicious, had made my family come here before thanksgiving one time after trying the spaghetti in los angels in a Denny’s dinner food is very good but my only trouble is that the dinner carpeting smells a little bit off a not pleasant smell, but overall food is really good!!</text>

Amazing!!!! The set up they have outdoor is absolutely beautiful. It has a tent wedding type of a feeling. Very romantic. The food was amazing!! Due to COVID, they bring all the salad bar to your table, cold and warm. They also bring any meat request that you guys have. We went here for a date night and we had an awesome experience. The staff was very friendly, the food was delicious. My personal favorite was the filet mignon. The Chimichurri is soooo delicious, definitely ask for a side of that. The cheese bread is amazing as well. As sides, the Beef stroganoff was really delicious, the arugula salad, potato salad and the Ceaser salad. I definitely recommend this place if you like Brazilian style steakhouse and all you can eat. Perfect for a date night most definitely.< /text>

<Review>Pleasantly surprised to see how informative and friendly their wait staff was, these guys were amazing....def not what I was expecting.  Had a super bird grilled turkey, tomatoes and bacon sandwich which was great, other two orders were half plate of nachos and boneless chicken wings which were also good.  Highly recommend this location, they work hard to create a great customer experience.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<time>1561952195267< /time><Rating>5</Rating><text>We have been to this location several times. This is our lunch spot when my son has the day off of school. We mostly go for lunch and have ordered burgers, skillets, eggs, pancakes, to salads. The location is off the main street and is clean. It does tend to get crowded during peak times. I have seen many of the same servers. The servers are friendly and most of the time attentive and check on you frequently. The food is good for Denny's. At times the service was slow from time you order to receiving your food. And other times it was quick. Overall it is a good location to eat at. The prices seem higher but since we have not eaten at another Denny's not sure if is this location only or all Denny locations. Worth the visit. If you are a milkshake they bring out the glass and then the silver mixing cup. So it is almost like getting two milkshakes< /text>< Pics>

Clean place and attending, courteous staff.  The cooks in the back do a good job of keeping up with the amount of customers and still doing a good job with the food.  I have not had a bad experience here yet.  Whenever I am craving a sitdown experience and I don't feel like waiting a long while, I come here and grab some decent food at a decent price.<//Text>

This particular Denny's goes above and beyond during its great night shift; Juan is a very competent and friendly manager, and his team is nothing but A+ customer service; I miss the late-night menus of olde, but that's more to do with Denny's franchise than this location proper; If you've not had a great experience with Denny's, give these cats a try at night, and see if they can't change your mind.</Review>

This is the only Denny's in my old neighborhood. They've always been friendly and clean. The service is fast, which is definitely appreciated. I came here at 3am the other night with some friends. Our servings were especially generous and extremely prompt.< /review>

With nothing else open at 10:30p, this Denny's saved the day, well night!  I had just flown into the area and was starving. This spot was super clean, really great service, nice staff, and the prime rib melt was really really good!< /Text>

They don't answer the phone and continue to hang up when you try to make a phone order. When you do get through and receive your food it is not what you ordered. Absolutely horrible will not be coming back ever again< /text>

Horrible place, waiter argues with you. I ordered a breakfast that comes with hash brown, country gravy and scrambled eggs. No where does it say sausage, it came to the table and had sausage on it. I told him I eat it all the time and it has never had sausage. He told me he’s worked at Denny’s for 30 years, and then he had to look at the menu to read it and it doesn’t say anything about sausage. He had to make my plate again.<//Text>

Don't bother with this Denny's.  They don't honor the free birthday grand slam.  Server was completely rude to me, had no name tag on probably so people can't report him, and claimed he was the manager.  Going to complain to corporate about this location first thing tomorrow<//Review>

<Review>I just visited this restaurant the other day.  It's alright now.  So much better than before those Indians from India were managing it. I complained about an A1 steak sauce with a straw inside and all they did was took it out and gave the same bottle back to me.  I feel so disgusted and they don't want to give me another steak and new bottle. Those Indians are  disgusting.  They think I tolerate them.  They want me to pay what they served with a contaminated sauce in the meat.</Review>< pics>

This Denny's is on the El Camino Real and is same as any other Denny's. The staff is good and the place is mostly full. If you are planning for Friday and Saturday late night dinner or snack, keep in mind this place is packed with people. The other positive I see that this place is located near many other food joint and is not secluded. Parking space is not at all limited and this place is wheelchair accessible. Good for kids and adults. Remember you do have many options around this place if you are actually looking for something more elaborate. I like spending time here as it's close to my place. To add they have started a new menu where you can have a complete meal in $4,$6 etc. Do check that out!!<//review>

Not the best atmosphere, building is weird and setup strangely, in need of a remodel.  Parking isn't great and the door is in a bad spot.  Employees were very nice and food was cooked correctly.  My main reason for 1 star is the Denny's menu.  I honestly had to just force myself to pick something.  Nothing on the menu looked that great.  Denny's just isn't that great, nothing negative about this one in particular.  If you like Denny's menu you'll be fine here unless ambiance is important to you.<//Text>

2 fried eggs, 2 bacon strips, 2 pancakes, all tasty for $4; 24 hours a day. What's not to like; especially when everything else is closed. Never get eggs prepared any way except fried to avoid nasty pasteurized egg mixes. Hash browns and sausages are tasty too. Rest of the menu is hit or miss. This Denny's is clean and comfortable. Service is good. 4 stars for 24 hour convenience, 3.5 stars for Slams.</Text>

The worst service ever. For the second time in a row we have experienced really bad service here. My kids love the desserts out here so we typically come after 10:30 pm for milkshakes and ice cream. We were seated for 25 mins and no one even bothered to come get our orders. The servers were just chatting amongst themselves. We had to call them 3 times before one of the servers came to take our order. Never come here if you can help it.</text>

I now give them 4 stars for upping their game with customer service. Keep up the excellent work guys!

Previous review:
Only reason they got any stars at all was cause the server which took my order was very nice otherwise wouldn'th get any. My order was pretty messed up. Old pancakes that were almost burned, gave me like half an egg and forgot the bacon.

Bad idea to order it for take-out. Only way to get what you want is to order while dining in<//Review>

This was a good Denny's. We walked in and the hostess was clearly overworked but still so very friendly. She needed a raise. A big one.
We were seated at a comfortable booth. After chatting with the hostess we took a second to look at the menu. As soon as we opened them our waitress came over asking for us to order. A little taken aback (luckily we already knew what we wanted) we ordered and she hobbled away without a word. She was a very interesting elder woman. After delivering our food and the check (without asking if we wanted anything else) maybe ten minutes max later, she hobbled away and never came back. We enjoyed the food, it was tasty. I personally enjoy the dinner food at Denny's versus IHOP.
All in all, not a terrible decision and it was a tasty one at that.

I would recommend this place.< /Text>

<review>Best Denny's in Santa Clara

I've frequented many Denny's restaurants throughout the US, and this one is my new favorite.   The Service is Excellent, the Food is Excellent and the price is usually the same wherever you go (but still good).

I often get the Pot Roast and I can say that it has been a long time since I've considered ordering it again in the same sitting (to go).

Denny's always has great down-home favorites such as Pot Roast,  Country-Fried Steak, Spaghetti and Meatballs,  or Fish and Chips.  This restaurant does them all a service.

If you want a good idea of how amazing Denny's can be, eat at this location.<//review>< response>

I go here often. Breakfast all day! Its fatty and not very health friendly but i burn the calories by some physical activities the next day.

They have a good customer service and good parking spots. For some reason i have seen cops cars always around the store but its a safe neighborhood. I lived close to this place for almost a year.<//Review>

The place is okay as long as you go with what ever they want to place in front of you.
Not acceptable service.... Remember, you order what you want. And should only be charged for what you asked for. Not what ever the service wants.<//Review>

It's Denny's. It's a Denny's.  The staff sometimes forgets about you, but it's a Denny's.  The food is decent, unless it's microwaveable, but again it's a Denny's.  The prices are reasonable, butcha know, it's a Denny's. There is always plenty of parking, because how often do people get together and say, "You know where we should go?  Denny's."</text>

This was the first time in my life where I authentically felt a tip was undeserved. I work my ass of for my wages, they should too.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I ordered an omelet online for pickup. I paid extra for avocado and the avocado had a lot of black spots on it. It was so gross that I through most of it in the trash. I also ordered sour dough toast and they gave me wheat. When you are hungry and looking forward to eating a healthy meal but get disappointed when you get back to your hotel room is a truly disappointing. Check your order before leaving this restaurant!!!!</Review>

One of the best Denny's I've been to! First time ever that the inside and outside did not smell of sewer/like bathroom.
The food was good, dining ware was clean and the staff was friendly.

Definitely a Denny's worth going back to from now on.< /Text>

Horriable service very slow not friendly at all. Went in to have lunch by myself I stood at the front as staff walk by me not even makeing eye contact or acknowledging me while standing there waiting to be seated. I finaly just sat down at the rail. Stuff took about 10 min to get my drink order and about another 5 min to get me my beverage (I ordered a water) ordered a basic 3 egg with sausage and hash brown breakfast took 20 mon to get my food. It was sitting in the window sitting there for at least 10 min. The place was not busy at all. Whem I got my food it was cold my eggs were soggy hash browns were soggy not crispy I ended up just leaving horriable dennys diffenly will not be coming back to this Denny's<//review>

Boke, the food was terrible. Everything we had was soggy, even the cheese was strange tasting.  My colleague had chicken and it tasted terrible. Not sure why but it wasnt nice and he only eat one bite. I wouldn't recommend this place considering how any great places are close by</text>

Denny's is Denny's..not one is better than the other. This one was a bit under staffed, and it took a while to get our orders and ticket but they tried their hardest. Got to give it to them Chicanos, for working hard.</text>

Food was gross. Really gross. We got our to go. Got back to our hotel.  Took one bite nearly vomited and threw it away. Smell was so bad too. Just thought maybe my senses were off. But no. God no.<//Review>

<Text>Honestly for once I can tell you that Denny's coffee really is not bad thanks to this location even at 3 in the morning or actually was surprisingly really good! My only gripe is there's no garbage cans outside and the parking lot was a little bit dirty but the inside of the store and everything else is just fine</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

For those of you who complain about it, knock it off. It's Denny's for crying out loud. It's not supposed to be a Michelin Star level restaurant! It's about the Grand Slam, pancakes, Hot Fudge Sundaes, and the great coffee... not to mention friends and a comfortable place to relax and reminisce.  It fits those requirements perfectly!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I almost gave up on Dennis until I ate at the one in Santa Clara I was so impressed on the clean restaurant and restroom, i eaten at a lot of Denny's    and this one is the best and the friendly staff. I was seated in 2 minutes eating in 15 minutes not like the one on Berryessa it takes 10 to 20 minutes to be seated and  you get your food about 45 to 1 hr after getting there even when the restaurant is only half full.</Review>

Really over crowed, services depends who you get for waiter, many new employees, something must be wrong, food take for ever assuming will be because of Manny costumers, generosity in the portion, food taste better than their counter part restaurant  couple of miles away from that location.<//Text>

<text>They got my order wrong TWICE.  I told the server i wanted my eggs well done and as soon as I put my fork into the egg, the yolk spread everywhere. It was sooo nasty, I don't eat raw yolk. when they brought my plate, they didn't bring my husbands and they took a while to bring it.  Also they took forever to bring a refill of water. We talked to manager and she did not say anything else than an "ok". I was expecting an ok service but this time service was horrible.< /text><response>None<//response><rating>1< /rating>< gmap_id>

<text>Went to Dennys today and was treated by the worse service I've had at a restaurant. Ask for the manager and she was just as rude. Ask for her name and she said it was against policy to give her name and she didn't even have a name tag. The servers name was Naveli H.
It's just to bad when you give your hard working money for breakfast and you get treated this way.
I know one thing, Dennys has lost a customer for life and I'll be sure to share this on social media so that my friend and family won't have to be treated this way. Buyer beware they have no idea of the term " customer service".</text>< Pictures>

Very bad service. Unapologetic about it too! Food took 35 minutes to arrive that too after I asked them to check on it. And the food was cold! I had asked for pancakes, sausages and eggs - nothing out of the ordinary.<//text>

Very slow service, burned hashbrowns, rubbery pancakes and burned crumbs on top of pancakes.  Staff at register joking around with each other and barely paid attention to guests.<//review>

I said I was there for my birthday meal they didn't bother to tell me that that meant Grand Slam breakfast only and never having been there before for a birthday meal and gotten a birthday meal I ended up paying full price he took a dollar off my meal service was poor because nobody got around to bringing me water or checking on seeing how things were Etc LOL happy birthday< /review>

To nite was a very bad the manager left me on hold. I went to Denny in Santa Clara it was a mess.
The manager looked at me waiter did the same. Both of them did not say one word.
I waited overstay 6 minutes still no help say down waited.
I said to myself I will call in order and leave. I called manager answered please hold. I rode my 10speed home still on hold never had a chance to ORDER</text>

<review>Denny's is okay you know what you're getting when you get there you know the quality of the food and the service but I do not understand why they have a problem with refilling your coffee it is one of the pricier things on the menu but you almost always have to ask for a second cup of coffee good luck getting a third I feel like you're stealing from them</review>< Rating>

<text>(Translated by Google) Thank you very much for your work and effort.
It is very nice to order your breakfast and that your pancakes are so fluffy, that it looks like a piece of cake.
Thank you very much to the kitchen workers.
