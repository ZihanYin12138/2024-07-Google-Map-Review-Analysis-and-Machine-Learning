Jim and his team did a power steering flush for me with no notice (and said to drop by and they would top off the steering fluid for me in the future). They were polite, timely, and explained everything. They also noticed my tire sensor light on my dash and let me know that they tested the sensors. They charged me a reasonable rate for the service. The station on the corner of Arguello and California tried to charge me 9 times more for the same service. I appreciated my experience with Jim and his team and will definitely be back.< /Text>

Emerald Auto Repair is honest, timely, and hard working. True patriot. Not sure what else you could want from a mechanic! Recommend calling as he is always full. However, if it's an emergency, he will take care of you! I'm so grateful to have found him (thanks Google).</text>

<Review>I have been coming here for years and deeply trust in the owner, Jim, and his staff. They consistently find ways to only do the work that is absolutely necessary, and keep the cost of maintaining our car manageable. As an owner of a late 90s Toyota that will run almost forever, but does need upkeep, Jim’s team get my needs and I greatly appreciate it - the Bay is expensive enough already.

I’ll also add that Jim is a very large hearted individual and once made a very large gesture of generosity when I was in need, which to him seemed like second nature. Top human in my book!

High quality work, competent team, family feel, and great value. I highly recommend this auto repair shop!</Review>< date>

< Review>
I had my car there for a week and realized when I picked it up that a brand new box of headlight cleaning solution was stolen from my trunk that I had purchased before dropping it off. I left a voicemail message with a complaint and received no reply. The owner should certainly look into this considering that other customers could eventually have something of real value stolen. And maybe a callback with an apology would have been an acceptable response.</Review>

After getting an inspection from another shop and an estimate I couldn't afford, I came in wanting those specific parts replaced and instead of just saying,  "sure, no problem" like every other shop I went to having no problem taking as much of my money as possible, Jim admitted that one of the parts I thought needed replacing, in fact, did not!

He gave me an estimate lower than every other shop and we made an appointment for Monday.

Then I read the reviews online and started to worry a bit.  What if it's all too good to be true and this "dirty" shop and con comes after I bring my car in and it's stuck there!?

Well, I came in first thing on Monday (to a remarkably clean garage btw despite all the parts everywhere in random places, the garage space was completely empty and spotless), all my paperwork was there and remembered, and everything was fixed by the end of the day as promised!

No surprise problems or bills, even a phone call midday to confirm the numbers, and the car is running perfectly! Jim even told me to bring it back if there were issues and he'd fix anything for free but I have had no need!

I'll be coming back for sure.</text></record></dataset><record>

Didn't get service here, but these guys were first to help me out when my bike was recently creamed by a speeding driver.  Helpful and friendly mechanics staff the place, and they seemed busy, so that's a good sign.  One of the guys was a street racer and had put together a nice Miata.  He knew what he was doing, and that is good sign #2.< /review>

As a poor worker who relies on his car to get to out of town jobs.  Jim has saved me over and over and over again.  He persistently charges me 30% less, than most shops charge, and always makes an effort to get me back on the road and earning as soon as possible.

This is an update to this horrific place. I had work done there about 3 months ago. They kept the car for six weeks and trashed it. I had a thermostat replaced and had a module replaced, they were supposed  to fix some other electrical issues but didn't. The primary work to be done was the module for the rear door of an SUV. It didn't open.  It is supposed  to open from the side and into a tailgate. I checked the side opening and it worked about a third of the time, which was good for that place. The thermostat works better. But today I checked the tailgate for the first time as I needed to load some heavy bulky equipment, a large aperture telescope which requires ramps and an extended tailgate and it doesn't work. I was remiss in not checking the tailgate but I  just wanted to get away from that place as quickly as possible and I have no intention of going there again even if they offered a free repair.< /text>

RUN from this darkly sinister place! That was my first impression when I drove in. It's a very dirty garage with parts scattered precariously about. Unfortunately I didn't run. The place was recommended by a reputable garage for electrical work and it was conveniently in my neighborhood.
It took SIX weeks to get my car back for simple repairs, which weren't done right. They managed to lose a hubcap and got grease on the upholstery and carpet and the front bumper got some deep scratches.    DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!<//Text>

Great service, very fast and probably priced too low.

Jim also gave us great advice about replacing parts, and suggested where to source them more cheaply, etc.<//review>

his is a great atmosphere with even better drinks. We got a Viex Carre (great drink, ice, and glassware) and a pinot noir (the bartender took the time to note that the pinot was different than listed on the menu and he seemed pretty excited about the change). Fun place to hang out, even late on a Sunday. Really feels like a neighborhood bar.<//Text>

Brought my Rav 4 in for a inspection for people to buy. The owner (Jim?) kept telling the potential buyers there was multiple things wrong with the car. Went to the Toyota dealership in San Bruno, turns out nothing was wrong with it whatsoever. Second set of buyers went through this same place and turns out the owner was a friend of the buyer so lone and behold miraculously all of those "problems" from the first visit didn't exist! Tried to get my own personal license plates off the car back to myself. Then Jim chimed in saying you can't keep them they have to go to the new owner of the my car. I'd do everything to stay away from this place super sketchy business!!!</text>

After playing mechanic roulette we found an honest shop that I feel has honest prices and great work had a transmission mount done here the job took longer but he still charged the same price no argument with how much extra time his mechanics had to put in I really would recommend this place to anyone who has car problems I have found my new mechanic thank you you guys were great</Review>

DON'T TRUST THESE GUYS! Jim Gavin is a irresponsible and pretends to be a "nice guy" but I have seen his dark side. He couldn't get my car to pass smog so it I couldn't register it, and he parked in the street. My car was towed by SFMTA while in his care!! He didn't even apologize or respond to my calls! He was too much of a coward to even respond! (I had it safely stored prior to his stupid mistake)

On top of that, a friend went in and when he found I was associated with things he tried to double the price of the estimate on an old friend's car. I lost $4,300 + because of him. I hope his bad karma bites him the ass.</review>

Very fast.

Had a problem with a leaking radiator and the chevy dealer wasn't able to fix the problem in the next 7 days. But I needed my car to drive back to San Diego the next day.

So I went to Emerald and he replaced my radiator and fixed my problem in a few hours and saved my ass ;-)

Thanks</Review>

Stay away from this shop!! The owner Jim Gavney is a liar and a fraud. I've never written a Google review before but my experience with this guy has been so negative I'm motivated to let the world know to stay away from this shop. I've had the unfortunate experience of having a Nissan truck break down on a trip from Ptld, OR to San Fran. My son was driving the truck and we decided to bring it to Emerald Auto based on the Yelp reviews. After misdiagnosing the problem and running a bill up beyond the value of the truck I was left with some lousy choices, of which I chose to leave the truck with Gavney in lieu of the exorbitant bill we had. Long story short, over a year later I receive a parking ticket as the still registered owner of the vehicle. Not only has Gavney not transferred ownership, he's racking up parking tickets that he won't pay. At the least this speaks to a person who can't organize or more likely is totally incompetent. WORD TO THE WISE-STAY AWAY.< /Text>

<review>They've helped me and my parents for years. Always genuinely asking how we are and they have always shown kindness and respect with us. Their customer service is amazing, I always feel welcome and understood. What stood out is that they treat my dad with calm respect too and make us laugh, my dad is a crazy old man who can be hard to get along with but the fact that they are nice to him means the world to me. My dad loves their service too. The other main reason I will always keep going here is that they have the LOWEST insurance rates out of any company I've tried and have heard of. I have a speeding ticket on my license but i still pay about $50 per month on insurance. My friend used to pay $150 and he just signed up with these guys today and now only pays $66 a month. I recommend everyone to give these guys a try, they are very accommodating.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I have came here since 2005, wouldn't trust anyone else to file my Taxes than Diana. All the staff are amazing people all super friendly! Even with Covid going on right now they are very hospitable and nice. I recommend them to everyone of my friends and family.</text>

<review>I have had Diana, of Lemos Tax Service, prepare our taxes for the past 10 years. She was able to identify several areas where we were not taking advantage of deductions.

Fun, friendly atmosphere,  the people are nice, down to earth, very helpful people. Store is very organized and clean.  And lots of collectibles in stock. Very good pricing on items. Lots of Funko Pops!  Some valuable and some commons. Overall, a great experience and I made some wise purchases and feel absolutely no buyers remorse!!! This is one customer who will shopping there for a long time!!!< /Text>

<Review>Cool place, I went in to see what they had for football cards. They had a few boxes for sale, which was nice since cards are going crazy right now. They had a lot of NFL stuff, they also had a bunch of those funko pop, and a decent amount of star wars stuff. They also had another store just down the mall that was all toys. Lots of cool stuff for collectors on both shops.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80945d43cfcb7187:0xa2b5b140ecbe534c<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

this place has everything you can imagine! They have been eating between sports, toys, mugs, cup holders, helmets, foam hands and fingers, and so much more! The guy there is very patient but very short with people but he definitely has a lot to exchange and sell! They even have the old Wheaties boxes with all the awesome celebrities and athletes! They even have the latest and greatest pop collectibles! 😁 Stop by when you can! Open from 9 to 4!<//Review>

WOW!!!! What a great store. If they do not have (which is rare...they have a lot of items at great prices) what you want they can usually get it-which has been my experience. Staff is knowledgeable and has always been very helpful and courteous. Highly recommended. Whether it be sports,toys,collectables...They even have purchased some items from me at what was an extremely fair price.</Review>

<text>Don't read these one star hacks giving negative reviews on this place. I've purchased items from here quite a few times and their pricing is just fine. They go off various sources to make sure it is up to date, especially when it comes to Funko Pop items. This is a local spot so they have to make a profit. The staff there is really cool too. I've never had a problem. In fact I was looking for a Freddy Krueger one day and one of the guys said he had some in one of his boxes in the back. I left my information for him and within a few hours, he called me. I've even sold items to them and never had a problem.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

My experience at One Dental was amazing! Dr. Kim is awesome!

He patiently listened to all of my concerns, and took time to explain what might be going on and how we can approach it. I felt very heard and understood. His assessment of what my teeth need was so honest, and he treats very carefully and conservatively to avoid doing something unnecessary.

Dr. Kim was also able to do something that 3 other dentists were unable to do - he adjusted my crown perfectly, and now I can finally bite down comfortably again! He looked at it and knew exactly what the problem was, and the adjustment was done very gently and carefully. What a major relief - Thank you Dr. Kim!

The whole team is super nice and does a wonderful job, and the office is very clean and modern. They all made going to the dentist feel enjoyable and stress free!< /Text>

The nicest staff ever!!! I felt welcomed as soon as i entered the beautiful office! I loved the fact that you got to have a “meet and greet” with Dr. Kim before sitting in a chair. I felt relaxed and comfortable. Very knowledgeable employees, high tech equipment. Cant wait to go back in 6 months!<//Review>

I love Dr Kim and his staff! The staff at the front desk, no matter who it is, are always so welcoming and friendly. And Dr Kim is also so friendly and never pressures you for procedures. He will give you options and then he will tell you to make an appointment when you’re ready. His dental assistants, again no matter who it is, are so friendly. Just learned that their chairs are massaging and equipped with heat as well. My cleaning appointment was very relaxing.  I usually have a lot of anxiety when going to the dentist but I have to say that Dr Kim and his staff really put you at ease, they make it a relaxing atmosphere.</Text>

<Review>Excellent first visit. Clean, aesthetically pleasing office and cute gift box we received after visit. All staff were friendly and professional as well. Dr. Kim was very easy to talk to and answered all of my questions very thoroughly. Cleaning was not rushed and I was able to get fillings done on the same day, which I really appreciated. Affordable and reasonable price too!! I recommended Dr. Kim to my friends who are looking for new dentists and my family will definitely go back for our future dental visits.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Hands down the best dentist I've ever had. Dr. Kim explains what he's doing, what those crazy codes are he's reading off to his assistant...wow! Never experienced that before over forty+ years of dentists!

Warm and friendly staff, beatiful and comfortable design. Also, you can watch Netflix while you're reclined in the chair.

I am moving soon, counties away, and intend to return for my dental visits!<//text>

Nicest office with the nicest people. I hadn't been to the dentist in a long time, and was pretty nervous. They answered all of my questions and helped calm my nerves. They have very reasonable prices as well. My hygienist Wendy, Dr. Kim and the staff were all wonderful. Thank you!< /text>

<Gmap_id>0x808e3398ef62068b:0xacf8ce17a7a88e8a<//Gmap_id><text>10/10 would recommend. It's been a long time since I've visited the dentist and I knew that my next visit would require a fair amount of cleanup, a probable route canal and a handful of cavities. I expressed my anxiety when I scheduled the appointment and the young lady on the phone was absolutely fantastic. She acknowledged my anxiety, wasn't dismissive. The visit itself was better than expected. With a Covid screening at the door, it was clear that the health and wellness of the staff and patients is taken seriously. After some initial x-rays, I sat down for a brief but thorough consultation with Dr. Kim. A consummate professional and bedside manner fantastic. At this point, the anxiety had subsided. Dr. Kim and his dental assistant (Alexis?) narrated everything they were doing and why, with regular check-ins during each stage of the procedure.

And then it was over. We had a debrief, and planned the next phase of my treatment. His scheduler was busy with another client so Dr. Kim actually went through the billing and payment with me.

This clearly demonstrated that he is familiar with every part of his business, and it's a team effort with a positive and professional vibe. Great experience. 10/10.</text><name>Chris Murphy<//name></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I had a very pleasant experience at One Dental. Dr. Kim and his staff were very professional and welcoming and provided an excellent service. I went there for tooth pain and they gave a very thorough examination, followed by a great explanation of different options that I could choose from as a patient. Dr. Kim listened carefully and provided the right level of service appropriate for my treatment. The service/examination fee/cost was also very reasonable based appropriately on the level of service provided. Overall this was the most pleasant experience I've had at a dental office from the moment I stepped in until I left, and I would strongly recommend Dr. Kim's office, where you'll meet a caring, trustworthy, and highly professional team.< /review>

<text>Great and professional dental office. The Facility is modern and new. No dated equipment here. Their staff are professional and attentive to your needs. I especially like that they have a tv screen in the exam room. You can watch Hulu or Netflix which provides an element of relaxation and entertainment during your visit.
If you've been longing on going to the dentist because of bad experience or procrastination, come to this place!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808e3398ef62068b:0xacf8ce17a7a88e8a< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wow. Just wow. Looking online because my tooth started hurting the night before. Saw they only had availability Jan 5th! I thought I’d make the request anyway and see if they might be able to squeeze me in the next day. First thing in the morning they booked me. I even mentioned I’m moving in a week. I went in wore my mask, everyone working was wearing a mask. Only 3 employees and one patient I was never in the same or space as. They kept things really safe. Air filters in every room, etc... not sure what else you can do. Anyways don’t hesitate to go. Best part of all, lead dentist is super kind, very knowledgeable and really gives you all the info you need for what you decide to do. Even talked through cost before doing any work with me to make sure I knew what my insurance covered.< /text>

This is basically the best dentist I have ever had.  The office is totally different than a traditional office.  The staff was awesome, the ambiance was awesome (it made me feel happy) and the music in the background while I was at my dentist appointment was awesome.  The cool part is that even though they have state of the art equipment that I had never seen before, I felt no pain.  I guess the two tv screens that you get to watch Netflix on while they are working on you distracts from any discomfort.

I have a deep cleaning soon, and I expect a good experience!<//review>

<review>Super modern facility and Dr Kim does a great job. Talks you through options and isn't pushy. The staff is also very polite and clearly enjoys working there.

Staff aside, the X-ray machine talks and you can watch TV while getting your teeth cleaned. Doesn't get much cooler than that.< /review>< pictures>

I can say that I have never had such an amazing experience at a dentist! My daughter and I saw Dr. Kim and his amazing staff today for the first time and were impressed from greeting to goodbye. The office is beautiful and the staff friendly and attentive. Dr. Kim did a consult with my daughter (9) and I prior to our exam. I have never had a dentist take this extra time. I especially appreciated his attention to prior experiences with dentists to identify any anxiety and offer assurance. My daughter felt nervous and this extra step went far. She both loved the screen above the chair in the ceiling to watch Netflix. I really appreciated the X-ray on the big screen to go over everything and then digital images to illustrate areas of concern. Dr. Kim was gentle, provided options and I have found our family dentist at long last. We even got an amazing little parting gift. Honestly, visiting One Dental was a whole experience and I’m here for it!<//Review>

<Review>I don’t normally leave a review but I did today because my experience here was top notch. It was my first time seeing the dentist in the Bay area and. Dr. Kim and the team were incredibly kind and helpful. I went there for a routine dental cleaning and regular check up, they provided honest and caring dental treatment plan and made me feel very comfortable. I would definitely recommend One Dental to my friends and people if you are looking for a better experience at the dentist.< /Review><resp>None<//resp><pics>None<//pics><user_name>JB Choi< /user_name><gmapID>0x808e3398ef62068b:0xacf8ce17a7a88e8a< /gmapID>< Rating>

Do you deal with someone with an urgency like that? Don’t be so desperate for collecting data especially when someone says they’re in pain and need one word not providing data for 7 mins and then you let them know that you have an open slot in a month.

I loved my experience with Doctor Kim and his staff! From the moment I entered to the time I left the office I felt welcomed and comfortable. Their equipment is state if the art AND I got to watch a movie to distract while my deep cleaning was taking place. I’m so happy to have been referred to One Dental.</Review>

I normally have a big fear of the dentist but Dr.Kim took the time to tell me the game plan, and made sure to answer all of my questions throughly. Managing work and school makes my schedule tricky and they’ve been more than accommodating to me. The entire staff is amazing, and the cleanliness is awesome! Definitely found my dentist.

David has done a good job making One Dental the most pleasant experiences at the dentist I've had. The interior is very modern and cozy. I had close to zero waiting time and David actually does an interview for new patients so he can get to know their needs. After my appointment he provided me with helpful information on treatments I had been considering for a while with cost breakdowns showing what I would incur after insurance. Highly recommend his services to anyone looking for a skilled and trustworthy dentist.< /Review>

<Review>I am a new patient at One Dental and I had a really great experience while I was there!
The office was incredibly clean and organized, with all precautions taken due to COVID.

Dr. Kim, as well as his team, were incredibly kind and welcoming. Probably like most people, I tend to get very anxious simply being at a doctors office, let alone when needles are involved, even as part of a routine procedure. It was remarkable how safe and relaxed Dr. Kim and his team made me feel during my procedure; I barely even felt the needle as the local anesthesia was being administered.

Having had less than stellar experiences with dentists (who were not so gentle with needles) when I was younger, I was pleasantly surprised with how great my appointment went; so much that I am not dreading going in for my next deep clean.

To top it off, as a new patient I was sent home with a small care package filled with oral hygiene products.  One Dental is an awesome office.< /Review></record>

It was overall a great experience. The teeth cleaning and exam were quick yet comprehensive. Dr. Kim and his staff are friendly. The instrument are high tech. They did a great job on keeping me safe during COVID. They also pay detailed attention on "customer experience", including water, consultation, the TV both in front and on ceiling, as well as small gift before I left. While the bill seems a bit more expensive for fillings compared to my previous place at Berkeley, they explained things well about where each item comes from. I will highly likely come back.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Personally, I have a big fear of dentist. But he completely changed my perspective as he took the time to ask about my previous experiences, and what my fears were. He took his time, explained the whole get down to me & even made sure I was comfortable. They even knew my fiancé by name when she’d call and ask questions. They truly care for their patients. Everyone was amazing, from the receptionist down to the man himself. 10/10 impressed and will definitely be going back.</review>< user>

<Text>I was referred to Dr. Kim by a friend and was very impressed with the patient care and the office!!!

The office is very modern, clean, comfortable, and high tech. I was amazed at how organized the dental office is, and they always started my appointment on time.

Dr. Kim is very personable and takes the time to really get to know the patients. He really cares about patients' dental and overall health. I had a cleaning and a filling done and it was the most comfortable treatment I received from at a dental office!

This office goes above and beyond to make sure your experience is great! HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR. KIM!!!</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

From the modern designs to modern technologies to the super knowledgable friendly staff, this place gives you an overall experience that you can't anywhere else.

The overall experience is a bit different from other locations. You first appointment, you will have a quick 1:1 with Dr. Kim to get a better understanding of you, your expectations and any other questions you might have. His staff are friendly and easy to talk to. They did a good job with keeping me safe during COVID. I only had my teeth cleaned, but can't wait to come back for my next appointment.</review>

As one who fears dental offices and has panic attacks when in the dental chair, I was a bit hesitant to go. But with the new year, dental health and hygiene will be important to me. Minutes away from my work place, I came in on my lunch hour, met the friendly staff and doctor, brief introductions in a warm and modern environment... feeling confident i said let’s get started! Doctor gave me step by step instructions on what was happening next, checked on me and rested periodically while I was in the chair as I told him I would be anxious, clean warm towel after, talked me on the way out and expectations for the future, and a gift goodie bag as a first timer. I appreciate all the little thing this dental office has done to make me feel comfortable. I have another appointment this week and feel at ease coming back! Thank you doctor and team!< /Text>

Stumbled upon this place as I was shopping at Walgreens across the (mini) lot.  From the outside, looking in, you could see the simple, clean layout of the office.  From setting up an appointment online, to filling out the online forms, to taking your first steps into the office, everything is so organized and well laid out.

I love the black and white theme and (I know, i know... it's clean and new now) everything is just so pleasant and easy on the eyes.  This adds to feeling more at ease while at the dreaded dental office.  On top of that, there's a TV in front, and on top of you, for when you're in either the upright or reclined position.  You can just Netflix and Chill (not that kind of chill...) while Dr. Kim operates on your teeth.  You'll be equipped with protective eye-wear and a set of wireless headphones to distract you from the drilling and grinding of your teeth.

Another plus here is that all your documents are on their tablet so instead of pretending to read everything, they can just watch me swipe down to the bottom and sign my life away.  On that same tablet, I do like how all of his findings from my scans are listed out and prioritized for which "issues" to address first.  What's also great is that your insurance/out-of-pocket costs are all presented in front of you so that you can see when your insurance coverage for the year has been exhausted.  Instead of cheaping out and "risking it" to save a few bucks on the extensive number of items my teeth need attending to, Dr. Kim will let you know what he thinks are major concerns that should be addressed as soon as possible, and then the items you can defer to next year when your insurance will cover some more.

If only i brushed twice a day AND flossed more routinely...  oh well...  YOLO!

TL;DR - if you haven't been to a dentist in a while, you might as well start now.  I fully recommend Dr. Kim to be your next dentist you see on the regular.  Shout out to his assistants as well!  They make everything pleasant while visiting the dentist.

oh yeah...i got a nice care package during my first visit!  It's a nice touch.

+1 oh yeah...  my temp crown fell out and notified Dr. Kim around noon and his office got back to me and scheduled me for a 4:30pm appointment to get me back on my chewing ways...  great service!</Review>

From the moment I walked into OneDental on Foxworthy and Almaden as a new patient, I knew I was in for an unprecedented dental experience. The office itself has a sort of minimalist design element; sophisticated but very comfortable. It almost felt like a spa honestly. Right down to the chairs with massage features and the warm towel my hygienist handed me at the end. Everything in this office seemed to be cutting edge. It’s like if Silicon Valley merged with Deep Space 9; jaw dropping cool. I could go on for paragraphs  about how impressive the office itself is but I would be remiss if I did not mention how wonderful the people working in the office are! There is no pretentious energy in this place. Dr David Kim and his staff were so warm, considerate, accommodating and welcoming. They were all extremely knowledgeable and professional but also had this refreshing humbleness about them. Dr Kim took the time to do a meet and greet with me and go over my dental history and concerns before I even sat in his chair. I didn’t feel like just another patient on their schedule. Each member of the staff really took the moment to meaningfully connect with me. The dental cleaning was timely and painless. The x-rays were digital and seemed so much easier than the clunky machines I’m more accustomed to at other offices.  Checkout at the end was a breeze. The gal at the front desk came to my chair with a tablet to do the checkout! Getting to the office is also easy and parking is plentiful. Another thing that I was impressed with was the little box (a biodegradable box, not a plastic bag- thank you OneDental!) of dental goodies I was handed when I left. Yes, even the end of visit goodies went above and beyond. There are so many amazing things about this office. Too many to write here. I recommend you book an appointment to see for yourself. Thank you One Dental for setting the bar so high that I’m looking forward to my next dental appointment!<//Text>

<text>One Dental is by far the best dentist I’ve ever been to. I’ve been trying to schedule a dentist appt for myself, my husband and my son for 3 months now. The problem was I couldn’t find a dentist with great reviews and an open schedule. My uncle referred me to one dental because of the excellent service he received  at his first visit. The staff in the office were extremely friendly and made me and my family feel welcome. My son didn’t want to leave the dentist. “Never thought I’d say that”. I would refer everyone I know to one dental. Knowing they would have the best dental service I had.< /text>< user_name>

Newly opened dentist office. clean and modern space. Dr. Kim and his staff are super nice, attentive and knowledgeable. For my first visit, I even got a very nice goodie box with nice lip balm and various travel size teeth care kit. Obviously, they have put a lot of good thoughts into the business and customer commitment. I really liked their streamlined online booking system through which you can easily view open slots and reserve your appt. Keep up the good work.<//review>

This brand new dental office is the most modern one I've ever been to! I am so happy that I found this place and I had a great experience going there for the first time. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the office is clean and comfortable , check in process is fast and convenient,  they even have the heated massage dental chair which is pretty amazing, but the most important thing is that Dr Kim is very knowledgable in dentistry, he is caring and patient to answer all my questions in details. I would highly recommend this dental office!< /text>

One Dental rocks!!!  I love the modern  & minimalist style of the office... from the reception area, consult room to the actual treatment room.  Their up-to-date technology is very impressive. They provide all the conveniences a patient can have during treatment.    Dr. David Kim & his staff is great!  They're very welcoming & friendly.  I feel at ease on my first visit today.  I'm glad I found Dr. David Kim & definitely would refer One Dental to my friends & family.  Thanks again One Dental!</Text>

<Time>1579636054350< /Time><rate>5< /rate><text>As one who fears dental offices and has panic attacks when in the dental chair, I was a bit hesitant to go. But with the new year, dental health and hygiene will be important to me. Minutes away from my work place, I came in on my lunch hour, met the friendly staff and doctor, brief introductions in a warm and modern environment... feeling confident i said let’s get started! Doctor gave me step by step instructions on what was happening next, checked on me and rested periodically while I was in the chair as I told him I would be anxious, clean warm towel after, talked me on the way out and expectations for the future, and a gift goodie bag as a first timer. I appreciate all the little thing this dental office has done to make me feel comfortable. I have another appointment this week and feel at ease coming back! Thank you doctor and team!</text>< Pictures>

Really appreciate the consultation before starting. Watching Netflix made the whole experience much easier. I was impressed by the oral CT scanner and the oral camera.</text>

This office is extremely nice and  modern. The staffs are very nice and Dr Kim is super nice and he explains all the treatment options very clearly, no confusion. If you are looking for a dental office, this is the “ONE”, because it is ONE dental.<//text>

ONE dental made me look forward to my next scheduled cleaning in six months. I’ve been to various well reviewed dentists in the area, and without a doubt Dr. Kim is the ONE to go to. His office is clean, modern, and has all the tech gadgets (like Netflix with headphones? Checked!) and lux services (how about a warm towel when you’re done?!). Dr. Kim invested the time to get to know my concerns upfront and answered all my questions patiently.<//Review>

<text>I’ll start by saying, I HATE going to the dentist. I hated it so much that I put it off for 5 years, until I had some recent tooth trouble that was too painful to not get it taken care of. Not having a primary dentist, I decided to call One Dental. They happened to be closed, but David was kind enough to come in after business hours and see me. The next day, he came in after business hours AGAIN and extracted my tooth for me. He was so generous and thoughtful throughout the whole process and made me feel comfortable. I am so glad I found One Dental and would recommend David to anyone that needs to see a dentist.< /text>< Gmap_id>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>Stumbled upon this place as I was shopping at Walgreens across the (mini) lot.  From the outside, looking in, you could see the simple, clean layout of the office.  From setting up an appointment online, to filling out the online forms, to taking your first steps into the office, everything is so organized and well laid out.

I love the black and white theme and (I know, i know... it's clean and new now) everything is just so pleasant and easy on the eyes.  This adds to feeling more at ease while at the dreaded dental office.  On top of that, there's a TV in front, and on top of you, for when you're in either the upright or reclined position.  You can just Netflix and Chill (not that kind of chill...) while Dr. Kim operates on your teeth.  You'll be equipped with protective eye-wear and a set of wireless headphones to distract you from the drilling and grinding of your teeth.

Another plus here is that all your documents are on their tablet so instead of pretending to read everything, they can just watch me swipe down to the bottom and sign my life away.  On that same tablet, I do like how all of his findings from my scans are listed out and prioritized for which "issues" to address first.  What's also great is that your insurance/out-of-pocket costs are all presented in front of you so that you can see when your insurance coverage for the year has been exhausted.  Instead of cheaping out and "risking it" to save a few bucks on the extensive number of items my teeth need attending to, Dr. Kim will let you know what he thinks are major concerns that should be addressed as soon as possible, and then the items you can defer to next year when your insurance will cover some more.

If only i brushed twice a day AND flossed more routinely...  oh well...  YOLO!

TL;DR - if you haven't been to a dentist in a while, you might as well start now.  I fully recommend Dr. Kim to be your next dentist you see on the regular.  Shout out to his assistants as well!  They make everything pleasant while visiting the dentist.

oh yeah...i got a nice care package during my first visit!  It's a nice touch.

+1 oh yeah...  my temp crown fell out and notified Dr. Kim around noon and his office got back to me and scheduled me for a 4:30pm appointment to get me back on my chewing ways...  great service!<//text><UserId.>105708142368993987759< /UserId.>< Date>

<Review>From the moment I walked into OneDental on Foxworthy and Almaden as a new patient, I knew I was in for an unprecedented dental experience. The office itself has a sort of minimalist design element; sophisticated but very comfortable. It almost felt like a spa honestly. Right down to the chairs with massage features and the warm towel my hygienist handed me at the end. Everything in this office seemed to be cutting edge. It’s like if Silicon Valley merged with Deep Space 9; jaw dropping cool. I could go on for paragraphs  about how impressive the office itself is but I would be remiss if I did not mention how wonderful the people working in the office are! There is no pretentious energy in this place. Dr David Kim and his staff were so warm, considerate, accommodating and welcoming. They were all extremely knowledgeable and professional but also had this refreshing humbleness about them. Dr Kim took the time to do a meet and greet with me and go over my dental history and concerns before I even sat in his chair. I didn’t feel like just another patient on their schedule. Each member of the staff really took the moment to meaningfully connect with me. The dental cleaning was timely and painless. The x-rays were digital and seemed so much easier than the clunky machines I’m more accustomed to at other offices.  Checkout at the end was a breeze. The gal at the front desk came to my chair with a tablet to do the checkout! Getting to the office is also easy and parking is plentiful. Another thing that I was impressed with was the little box (a biodegradable box, not a plastic bag- thank you OneDental!) of dental goodies I was handed when I left. Yes, even the end of visit goodies went above and beyond. There are so many amazing things about this office. Too many to write here. I recommend you book an appointment to see for yourself. Thank you One Dental for setting the bar so high that I’m looking forward to my next dental appointment!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

When I arrived, the office was very clean, sterile, and had a modern design. They gave me a remote to watch tv while in the dentist chair, they sat me back and there was a tv on the ceiling !! They also gave me headphones so listen to the tv while they were drilling away. After my routine teeth cleaning I felt like I had new teeth. They were so clean. Was really cool that they would see if I had cavities based off of the xrays and didnt have to poke at my teeth . I appreciate the goodie box they gave me as well.</Review>< pics>

<text>This 5 star is for a very sweet and nice manicurist - Wendy. I started going to this nail salon a few months ago and I was lucky to have Wendy as my manicurist. She is amazing. She listens to you and keeps quality and customer satisfaction as a priority. I can be very picky with detail and Wendy has always made sure I go home happy with my nails. She helps choose shades and designs, does not rush her work and you can feel that she loves what she does. She has been attentive on how I like things and after 1-2 visits, I no longer need to point out anything that needs fixing. For one appointment when Wendy was not available, I had to get my manicure done by another person, and I left unsatisfied. For me it’s Wendy only from here on.< /text>< Pics>

I love Crown Royal Nails--I usually go to the Riverwalk location, which I did yesterday. However, I was asked to go to the Gosford location since the Riverwalk location was too busy. I arrived around 4pm (an hour before they closed) and got a pedicure. Their website says that for $30, a classic pedicure includes a sugar scrub and 6-minute massage, both of which weren't done. It felt like they employees were just trying to finish quickly since it was near their closing time, which I understand, but I didn't get what I paid for. I'm really disappointed because I loved this salon chain, but I'm, unfortunately, going to have to find a new place to go to.< /Review>

I made an appointment and I've still been waiting half an hour with no end in sight. You have to use their ATM if you don't bring cash. Giving 3 stars because it looks like they do good work and are reasonably priced. But, not very good service at all.< /Review>

He was very rude, loud and unprofessional. He answered personal calls and was unaware of the my pain when I expressed he was scrubbing my arches raw for a heel treatment.  When he cut my cuticle it bled and also burned my foot with the hot lotion. I have blisters forming as I type this. I have never experienced this type of service anywhere. This is absolutely unacceptable. Please do not spend on over priced services here because quality and professionalism is considerably lacking.<//Text>< Name>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Got on the waitlist online and was texted and told to arrive in 30 minutes. We arrived exactly 30 minutes later for 2 pedicures. Waited 10 minutes to be seated. Then they put cold water in the bowl and told us they would fix it, which took 30 minutes.. then waited another 45 to even start the pedicure.  I counted 4 people walk in after with no appointment and get started on right away. Total wait time was an hour and 15 minutes then they rushed through our pedicures. I’ve tried multiple times but it’s no use. I will not be coming back.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

So I simply asked if they could do a design on one nail and he rudely said no, so I asked if I could just have the tips painted and he said they couldn’t do that either. I’ve never had issues like that anywhere else and also my nail polish is chipping really bad already and I paid extra for gel. Definitely not going back. Would not recommend</Text>

I’ve been meaning to try this place! Finally it’s back open! It was so worth the visit.

They welcome walk-ins, along with appointments. I was able to get seated right away. Variety of colors to choose from. Staff kept it professional, I felt welcomed and comfortable. The ambiance felt relaxing and super clean nail salon compared to others here in Bakersfield.

With COVID, there are new guidelines and rules. They’re spacing all the clients out, sanitizing, masks are mandatory, IT IS SAFE. It’s so important to know these changes and this salon follows the guidelines to keep the clients safe. Appreciate you guys!

Highly recommend, I’ll be back soon!!!<//text>

A little expensive. Also, bright lights and lack of ambience make this less relaxing.< /Text>

I like this nail shop. Top quality and  very nice staff.  Mia is the  best  but shes booked all the time so I went to whoever was available and was not disappointed. It can be a little pricey but worth it.< /Review>

<review>DO NOT GO TO THIS SALON! They use MMA acrylic which is really bad for your nails. i got my nails done over 2 weeks ago. Took me ALMOST 4 HOURS to remove my nails (YES I AM TRYING EVERY METHOD)  because they decide to use a cheap illegal product. Also when i was in the process of getting them done, they were coming out crooked so i corrected him nicely asking him to fix them & shortly after that he became very rude and rough with my nails. overall , don’t recommend them. save your money<//review><name>marie xoxo<//name>< resp>

<Text>On July 9th my family & I had a terrible experience at the Crown Royal at Gosford. We had a scheduled appointment for five pedicures. Four of us waited for 45 minutes until they attended us. However, they had my mom wait 1hour and 10 minutes before they attended her. They ignored her & I asked one of the nail techs why my mom was being ignored. He said, “where is your mother” & I turned to my mom who was right next to me. He said we will get to her soon, she’s next.

She was waiting patiently with her feet soaked in cold water. I tried my best to give them the benefit of the doubt since there was 4 of us receiving a pedicure.

However, as soon as a Caucasian woman walked into the salon they attended to her & started her pedicure. Keep in mind my mom was up next.

After, I left I reached out to the manager Kevin & explained to him the situation. He said that he would give me & my family a 30% discount next time & that he was truly sorry & it won’t happen again.

However, I called him today to schedule an appointment & he told me that he couldn’t give my family discounts even after he promised me he would.

Kevin & his employees need to work on treating people of color with more dignity & respect.</Text>< pics>

I'm real picky about my nails I've been going to the same place, same nail tech for almost 8 years. I really needed my nails done because I had an interview and they were looking bad like a month and a half past a fill bad.
They are Covid-19 compliant as any one place can be I would definitely go there again if I needed to.<//Text>< Pictures>

I started coming here 2 years ago when they opened their location on stockdale. Where I met my favorite mail tech CeCe (Cindy). So once she moved locations, I obviously was going to follow wherever she went. Cindy is definitely your girl, very precise and thorough in what she does! She makes great conversation, gets to know you, and makes it fun! She’s also crazy talented and had a good steady hand. I’ve never had any issues at this location in terms of wait or anything like that. Cindy, Mia and the crew are on it! I liked how cleaned they kept the salon as well as their tools. And extra bonus for all the procedures they put in place for
COVID! I was able to make it in before they were closed due to covid; I appreciated the temp checks and hands free menus, etc. I’ll continue to fo to crown royal (especially as long as Cindy is around 😝)</text>

Dawn did my pedicure and did an AMAZING job! He was extremely delicate, patient, and takes pride in his work. Before doing anything else, he made sure I was happy with his work before starting to polish my nails. I will return back to him!

The only salon I trust to get my nails done! I come in at least once a month to get a gel mani/pedi and I ALWAYS leave satisfied with beautiful nails!! CeCe takes her time to make sure my natural nails are protected and not over filed. I’ve come in the salon requesting lemons, ombré, and other intricate designs and she ‘nails’ it lol (usually doing it freehand as well). She will not let you leave the salon unless you are completely in LOVE with your nails! I’ve recommended several friends to the salon and now they are regulars too! CeCe is super sweet and the salon is always clean. I won’t go anywhere else😊💅🏻< /Review>

<review>I had came in earlier at 2pm for a gel pedicure and I got told they only take appointments so I proceeded to make an appointment at 4:30. I arrived at 4:20 and got told to wait in my car to receive a text. Once it hit 4:40 I wasn’t going to wait in my car anymore so I came in and picked my color. I didn’t get my service until 6pm, mind you 2 people walked out because of them not being on time.</review>< Pics>

If you don't know their language is hard for them or you to understand and I noticed that they take a shortcut if they can get away with it still want them as they begin to soak my feet they thought they were going to soak it in just water until I ask them where was the thought or the Jets and as I sit there and watch the next person come in they soak their feet in warm water and then proceeded to work on them didn't put the jetty in didn't put the salt in also they're slow I won't be going back there</review>

Had such a great experience after having a terrible one at another salon. Went in to get a pedicure with an ingrown nail and remove the terrible job done a week ago at the other salon. Each person that tried to remove that awful black powder was easy and caring making sure to make them look right. I walked out of there satisfied with my new pedicure. They took their time to make sure i was satisfied. Will make this my regular go to nail salon.< /text>

So today 2/26/20 decided to try this new location. Waited 30 minutes to  be asked what I needed and was asked to take a seat on a chair waited another 25 minutes. Finally the nail tech that was doing my nail did such a horrible job. Kept asking her if she was going to leave my nails like that  she told me I am tired have not taken lunch if you don't like it sorry. Asked her for her name gave me a totally different name than what her receipt said. Called asked for the manager that I knew was there that was Mia told me she is not here right after I left so the I asked if I can speak to Kevin also was told he was not there. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Sad to say all locations they have are all the same poor service. And now the gel nail polish is chipping off.</review>

I decided to get both new set of acrylic nails with design and a gel pedicure on Sunday 2/16/20. Today is Wednesday 2/19 and 2 nails have already fallen off I had foil strip for one of the designs THAT came off too. Horrible quality for the value. Good thing I went in with their 20% off offer all services because my total would have been nearly $100. Very disappointed overall for them being a new nail salon. Knowing Mia has a couple other salons is very upsetting. You'd think the quality would be better or they would use high quality stuff for the price you pay. I just dont understand.</Text>

There was no social distancing and no one was wearing a mask. I thought places like these should be closed during a pandemic especially if they’re posting on their private social media that they’re sold out and people are packed as sardines.</Text>

Great spot to grab a beer and have some laughs. Bilingual staff, music, karaoke, dancing, live bands depending on what days of the week you are interested in. Locals are great with great vibes. I go multiple times a week. All are welcome.< /text>

<Text>Great place to go have some drinks and dance they have a DJ during the week and also Spanish band. I've grown to know the people that go there. The  owners Juaquin and Aris really nice people  and the DJ memo is awesome. The waitress are friendly and outgoing.

<review>Go here if you want to be surrounded by a bunch of dudes.  Not the winner types, mind you. I bought one beer and the whole time I was wondering what am I doing here? I was gone.  Will never return. Definitely for the shady underbelly of Perris.</review><Rating>1<//Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><Time>1485060847722< /Time>< UserId.>

This use to be a cool spot for a few beers and a dance with my girlfriend last year. (2015) We use to love coming here, it had really cleaned up its act. But now this new owner is running a wh0re house! The females that work here now will charge you $10.00 for their beer when the same exact beer you're drinking was only $4.00! Not to mention they will let you touch them for a few dollars and go home with you for the right price, gross! Also be careful when you use the restrooms..They will offer you d rugs like it's candy. My gf and I are upset that it went back to its old ways! If there was a negative 5 stars and a herpes badge I'd rate it that! You can also see that two of the 5 star ratings for this location are obviously employees or owners of the bar with the photos they posted along with their rating. So don't be fooled. Pathetic!< /Review>

<text>Nice lil Mexican bar, had a small local trio live singing group. Lots of bar "chicas" for guys if that's what your into but not the kind of bar u want to hangout with friends or girlfriend. They play only Spanish music & have 4 pool tables. So yea it's basically ur typical lil Mexican bar<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dca123fe90688d:0xa88be7119a0bcef5< /Gmap_id></record>

The staff was really quick to react and make sure that everyone inside the store was safe, they calmly told us what happened and to follow them to the back to follow active shooter protocol. I worked retail for many years as a manager, and I can tell you from experience that the crew working today was on point and did everything by the book very professionally and fast. Thank you to all the workers today present, you guys handled the situation like champs and even before that everyone was helpful and polite. I will be returning to shop to this location.<//Text><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2cc18c351cf25:0xa2f3f57060363f4c<//gmap_id>< Rating>

This store was a complete joke. If I could rate them a 0 I would drove from la to this store to return a pair of shoes and a female associate told me the customer that she was unable to return due to the fact that she had no cash in her register and that my refund was too big?? I’ve never heard of such thing. I paid with my credit card shouldn’t my money go back to my card? Well I left upset now I have to drive miles far away to look for another store that would refund me my money back!!! I will be calling corporate to file a report against this store and they’re bad customer service.<//review>

<Gmap_id>0x80c2cc18c351cf25:0xa2f3f57060363f4c<//Gmap_id><text>Honestly the worst store ever! Camped out for the Royal 1's and they had a first come first serve. So I put my chair in line and was the 10th person, we were only allowed to leave our chair and had to return to the other parking lot. I got there around 11 p.m. Friday night and waited till 9p.m the next morning. The crowd get very routy. So they decided to do the raffle system , ofcourse I did not win. The staff did not care that people had been waiting for more than 10 hours to purchase a pair of shoes just because of some kids who were being routy. This store sucks!!! Never coming back<//text></record>

< review>
My taxes are simple.One w2 form.Cynthia Arriaga messed my taxes up because she and h&r block are greedy.She rushed me through even though I had an appointment.I left with receipt in hand thinking my taxes were filed and the preparation was paid.It's August 5th and I still. Haven't gotten a return. I've been hung up on twice in the last two weeks trying to find out what happened to my return. Today I was told I didn't pay for the preparation.That is why they didn't file them.when I left I was told everything was taking care of. Cynthia gave me a receipt.I have never been late on my taxes until now THANKS TO CYNTHIA AND H&R BLOCK!<//review>

Got my taxes done here, first time at H&R as I've been going to liberty tax. I paid for an extremely expensive amount of money just to get my taxes done here over $300+ which I needed them to take out of my taxes instead of paying out of pocket because it was so pricey & they even charged me for that.... anyways I had an issue last year that took me to get my taxes 6 months after I filed because I had issues with filing medical 1095A.. so I knew I needed to get this done this year because I didn't want my taxes to take a long time again.. so when I went I told them I included my medical 1095 to file because it wasn't filed last year & my taxes were on hold.. he specifically told me that I didn't need to file it... so him being a tax worker I figured he knew what he was talking about & he knew what he needed to do.. filed my taxes great super fast! I filed it on March 1. It's has been 3 weeks I haven't received anything.. I ended up getting a letter from IRS that my taxes were on hold once again! & I even called IRS it's self & they told me it's on hold because I need to file my 1095A medical form.. which is the form I've told him to file from the beginning but he said I didn't need to!!!!!! Office closed due to covid so they couldn't get me to come in until they reopened.. which I totally understand! & we definitely can't control what's going on with the covid, but if he just filed that form I spoke to him about when I got there, I wouldn't have had this problem!  it is now May 27 & I haven't heard any updates on anything, so I ended up calling the office which was closed so it automatically transferred me to another office in El Cajon.. I told her my issue & she immediately knew it was the 1095A that needed to be filed so she said for me to come in to the office & she can help me.. really awful.. so I ended up going to the other location she helped me within 10 min & ended up telling me the location I originally got my taxes done was going to reopen till JANUARY!! Wow... No one updated me on the reopening at the location I went to, knowing they still needed to fix my taxes & said I can’t get it fixed until they had reopened.. I wish I could get a refund or half a refund at least for what he messed up on! After I even told him what my issue from last year.</text>

MIGUEL TORRES, from the H&R Block of the address PLAZA LA MESA LA MESA, CA 91941 has helped me along the way. I was new to filing my taxes on my own and he walked through the basics that I would need to know. He ended up giving me information that would be useful down the line to ensure an easier tax season next year.< /Text>

<Text>Because of Cynthia!  She is above and beyond.  I am normally not quick to trust and this is my first time not using the same person for 20+ years, but her compassion, her human touch, her knowledge.  She met me where I was.  She answered all of my questions and didn't make me feel like I was asking minor questions.  I was at peace when I left. I will be back, because of her.<//Text>< Pics>

What happened to this park? It turned Ghetto big time. Also the grass is overgrown & not properly maintained looks so bad compared to how it used to look!< /Review>

This place was really good.  What made this a 4 and not a 5 was the service, everyone was nice and good customer service, just the process from ordering to paying took a long time (will call ahead next time). The food was excellent and fresh. The price was up there but you got what you paid for. The next day we ate our leftovers, though it was microwaved it heated well. Did I mention the sides are ginormous? We will be back for sure!<//Review>

Legit BBQ. Turkey is well seasoned and juicy. Pull pork is also flavorful- complimenting-not overtaking the other meats. You have an option of lean or fatty Brisket. I got both and it was like butter. The triple meat sandwich is a great value for the mountain man portion. I ate it over Fries to capture all the juicy goodness. Very friendly service and definitely a good spot anytime.< /Review>

Ordered 1/2 pound of Beef Brisket. It is so smoky delicious, tender moist, and flavorful as the juicy fat melts in your palette. The best bbq smoked brisket in town and so far I get to enjoy. Rank # 1 - Smoked Beef Brisket</Review>

<text>Went to this barbecue place last year but it was closed.  Went back yesterday and picked up a rack of pork ribs.  Also a small side of sweet potatos with walnuts/pecans (I forgot which).

The ribs were outstanding.  The meat was so tender it had me sucking on the bone!  You can tell the quality of barbequed meat by the way it taste without all the sauces and condiments.  These ribs needed no additional sauce or anything to enhance their smoked flavor.  Although I did use a little of the sauce provided on the side, it was tangy and sweet at the same time.  Most importantly,, it doesn't overpower the meat.  A little bit goes a long way.

The sweet potatoes were tasty as well and complimented the ribs very well. The only thing about this dish was that were a bit too many walnuts/pecans for my taste.  Never the less, I will be returning soon to try their brisket and other offerings.<//text>< Response>

I want to start of this review stating that this is some  really good tasting BBQ the flavors are amazing.Sadly that's not enough to have a great experience when eating out. I paid 27 dollars for an order that literally just included 1 rib, 1 small piece of tri-tip, and a small portion of pulled pork.For the price I paid I expected a bit more food than what i got. This was not enough food even for me a not so heavy eater. The sides were ok in size nothing to go crazy about. I will definitely not be returning to this place for BBQ even though their food was actually really good.<//Review>

I admit the owner is my long time friend. But I am also a critic of food and brutally honest.
Ricky Hernandez studies and masters whatever he does to the finest detail.
The meat is cooked to perfection and is moist and flavorful. The bbq sauce is well balanced with a smokey flavor. The Mac and cheese made with smoked gouda.
Backed beans not too sweet with bits of "burnt ends" from the brisket in them.
Sweet potatoes just right with pecans and well balanced.
Cured pickels made the real way.
Pickled onions to refresh the pallet.
I wish the coleslaw had more vinegar ( just my preference) although it is very fresh tasting.
Gourmet beverages from Sprecher craft sodas, kombucha and mineral water in glass bottles.
A Very enjoyable experience.

Just ate a leftover piece of brisket from the fridge, still moist and the flavor is excellent cold.
Real meat eaters will understand.< /text>

We had a great experience here. The staff was very friendly letting us try different products before ordering and it was all delicious. We went ahead with the three meat plate with a side of one more type so we didn't miss anything. Highly recommend!<//text>

This barbecue is absolutely delicious. You will not be disappointed. The brisket is so tender and the flavor is unbelievably great. You can really taste the time and love put in to the cooking.
Fun story: I have 3 lb chihuahua who is very old, thin and not well. I have to give him medicine to encourage him to eat. Well when o was eating Jude’s Barbecue, I couldn’t stop my tiny pup from trying to eat my food directly from my plate... point is, this barbecue is so good it brought some life back in to my pup 🥰</review>

Good BBQ grassroots operation here.
Smells amazing walking in.
The staff is friendly and they treat you well.
Music from the south fills the room while you order.
The cuts of meat are there for you to drool over while you wait in line.
House sauce is great to drained the pulled pork in.
Their big sandwiches are SO SO good.
I like the 3 Meat deal to share.
Yes they have Mac n Cheese (baked) and Coleslaw (sweet / white sauce)
Cheese and jalapanos Sausage are awesome for a lunch during the week.< /Text>

They have beef ribs on Saturday. Only place I've found in IE with beef ribs. They had a sweet potato side which was awesome! Have both fatty and lien brisket. I went around noon on a Saturday and believe that can run out of the meats later on in day.  Was about a 20 min drive for me in Riverside but worth it. Will be going back!< /review>

Alright, stop wondering if you should give them a try - this is THE BEST BBQ I've had in CA. They even compete with some of my favorite spots over in Dallas. Amazing brisket and pulled pork, all very tender and (everyone's favorite word) MOIST. Stop giving your money to LUCILLE'S and start pumping money into Jude's so they open up more during the week. The staff is friendly, and the food is amazing. What else could you want?

Side note - please add burnt ends to the menu, the sample I got was amazing and you are really on to something.</Review>

Found this gem in our back to San Diego, family owned , local, delicious food , great attention and super clean. They told us they opened and Immediately got shut down during the pandemia. I'm so glad they could re-open again, because the BBQ is out of this world. They even gave us free dessert. Highly recommended.<//text>

One of my friends told me about this barbecue place that I had to try. So today I decided to give it a try. I tried their pulled pork and their beef brisket which they serve either lean or fatty. I also tried their pork ribs, their dinosaur Beef Ribs and their macaroni and cheese. I definitely was not disappointed. If you're looking for true barbecue flavor where the meat speaks for itself then you definitely have to try Jude's Barbecue. The owner Rick and the staff truly know their barbeque. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for true barbecue. Definitely one of the best I've had in a long time. You can truthfully taste the love in their food.< /review>

<text>Their brisket rivals the best I've had in Kansas City and Memphis. And like most good BBQ restaurants, they WILL run out of items before closing time. We got there an hour before they closed, and they were out of pulled pork, pork ribs, beef ribs, and most sides. Luckily they're local to me so I can easily go back, something I plan on doing often. Also, they had peach cobbler which isn't on the menu.
LOCATION NOTE:
You can see the place as you exit the N 15 fwy at Baseline, and it looks like you should turn R onto Baseline to get to the restaurant. NO! Go E on Baseline then S on East Av, which is the only entrance. No idea who designed that shopping center, but it's really messed up.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQdx1CumxPUjw9_TMOP0BZ73xq8RFzZkc54lUv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

I called the restaurant to see availability of meat and what time they would close. They were closing at 7 which was in 10 minutes but said they would stay open and gladly serve us if we were coming so I said yes. It was my moms 60th birthday and she wanted bbq! As we arrived I was greeted by the owner Rick and he right away took care of us. We were a party of 8 people and suggested a family party platter which contained a spread of everything on the menu! Everyone had their mouths watering! When he found out it was my moms birthday he gave us cheese cake and sang happy birthday. Great smoked meats, sides were amazing. The smell of smoke was in the air but not overwhelming. Environmental was very welcoming. We will definitely be regulars to this place!</review>

< review>
I went here earlier this year, and I still remember how delightful this restaurant was. By far the best bbq restaurant in California. Staff was incredibly kind. And food was top notch. The meats are smoked for a long time and you sure can taste it. Nice small hidden business I recommend to anyone.< /review>

<text>Best brisket Ever, they only use salt and pepper, all the flavor comes from the smoke, the brisket is so tender it melts in your mouth like butter. The Macaroni and cheese is also to die for, very nice owners who give excellent customer service and care. By far the best BBQ I've ever had</text>< pictures>

This was the best brisket I’ve ever had in my life. & I spent my childhood growing up in Texas. You won’t find better in California, or at least I haven’t yet. Worth every penny & if I could give 10 stars I would.<//Review>

Incredibly good BBQ!  The staff is very nice and welcoming.  I had the brisket plate with beans and Mac and cheese.  The brisket was very juicy and tender, the beans were very tasty and the Mac and cheese was very very delicious!  I will definitely be back again!</Review>

<Review>WOW! Brisket was sooooo good. Ribs fell off the bone. I’ve had BBQ all over the country and this place has it dialed in. You can tell how good of a spot it is by the smell. This place smelled like smoked meet and wood. For sure will be coming back here!<//Review><gmapID>0x80c34ba7ad71a9f1:0x5f4235fd1093be8b</gmapID><rating>5<//rating>< UserId.>

<Text>This is the best BBQ I have ever had in California. Serious foodie find.

The second you walk in you will smell wood from the stacks of red oak lining the walls which is used to smoke the meats.

The meat was the best Ive had. The meat is so tender. The Beef ribs were like nothing I have ever seen, it was more like a full steak with a bone attached. The baked beans were the best I have had in my entire life.

Recommend:
-Beef Ribs
-Baked Beans
-Brisket Sandwich
-Peach Cobbler

Owner opened recently (mid covid) and was a former food truck operator. Please patronize this place. In Rancho/Fontana the good privately owned places seem to fold, but it honestly blows away any of the corporate BBQ places near by and I want this place to stick around.< /Text>< Rating>

We probably started on literally the worst day to start a restaurant - the day the governor closed all dining rooms in California. We've wethered most of this storm without having are feet firmly planted yet. I think we'll be fine since we have the best patrons in the Inland Empire. Thank you everyone for your continued support. We will only get better at serving you."}<//response>

Pricey but the staff is nice and friendly. I probably will only go once every 6 months or so because of the prices. I never paid 12 bucks for a large mac and cheese anywhere else. Haven't tried the food yet but will follow up after I try it.< /Review>

Finally got time to try Jude’s BBQ. First thing I noticed - wonderful smoke smell inside the place. Second, the owner works the counter, slicing brisket.  Ordered two brisket sandwiches. He asks, “Fatty or Lean?” (never had a bbq place ask that if me before).  I said his choice, so he gave us a bit of both. Toasted buns. You can get them topped with sauce, pickles, slaw or pickled red onions.  We ordered slaw and beans as sides.

Verdict: Yum!  Some of the best brisket i’ve had in a very long time.  No dry spots, not tough, not overly fat, nice crust & smoke ring. Slaw tasted homemade, beans were loaded with meat & flavor. Sauce is nice, not too ketchupy or sweet, but no burn.

Also available were spareribs, pulled pork, sausage and (today) beef short ribs.

Everybody was masked & gloved up. Hand sanitizer is available on a table.

He said they run out early and close when they do, so come early.

Definitely, Definitely will be back!!</Text>

<Text>I ordered tacos de cabeza (cheek).  I wasn’t satisfied with my order at all.  The meat had no flavor. By the time i got to the table my tacos were cold. The 2 salsas were tasty. The red sauce is spicy. We also ordered quesadillas with meat. Those were nice and warm.
The restaurant is a pretty good size. The salsa area was clean as someone often comes out to check on it. Tables were also clean as well, someone comes out often to clean.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMiPhxUfMDddjHbSfnP6mJQYVY65_p2L1mjFUI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><date>1564960889439<//date><user_id>114747975487789998419</user_id>< name>

Solid inexpensive tacos. The lengua was very good, so is the cabeza. Carnitas was flavored well but a bit dry. The al pastor was disappointing, the meat was very dry and blackened. The salsa that they give you is on the spicier side, so are the roasted chilies, proceed with caution.<//Text>

I used to drive out of my way for the tacos, I noticed they didn't only changed the name but they increased the price at least three times in past year and a half, portions remain the same. This is not about the pandemic,
I understand that. Most of us have money issues I am in the food and beverage industry. I found a new place at the Stater bros. parking lot three blocks away, better portions  for .50 c more. I most say the green salsa is way better. Weekends only for now.
Good luck.</Text>

< Review>
Fantastic tacos. I got 4 tacos, a carne asada, al pastor, carnitas and pollo. The carne asada and carnigas was my favorite, but all the meat were good. The red sauce is definitely spicy if you like the spice. The service was fantastic too. Really friendly and quick service. I'd highly reccomend and the place is open 24/7!<//Review>

<UserId.>105853218368004682403</UserId.><text>24 hour Mexican counter service in the OC. Came here after hiking at Peters Canyon, so we were hungry. They have their own parking lot, so it’s easy to find a spot. Drive thru is available, and outdoor/indoor dining is available during covid.

The service was very warm and friendly. Credit cards are accepted. The food portions are very generous, and though the food is already prepared, it tastes great. As a bonus, you can get your food pretty quickly, as they assemble it very quickly. A variety of meats from carne asada to lengua to buche is available. We split a wet burrito with cheese and it was stuffed with cabeza (so tender), beans, rice, and onions/cilantro. There’s a red and green salsa available - I preferred the green one. For $1.75, you can also get a soft taco topped with an ample supply of meat (lengua in our case). Overall, great cheap spot with tasty food - I’ll definitely be back!</text>< Rating>

The food here is amazing. The staff is always polite, accommodatingand prompt in their service. I choose Taqueria HOY frequently for these reasons. Even though there are several alternatives closer to my home. It's always worth the extra mile or two of travel for the overall experience I get when I do so.<//Text>

From outside it looks like a very simple restaurant, but when you enter, you have that Wow effect. It is an elegant place with fresh air and a stunning view. Thank you, We will be back for sure.< /Text>< rate>

They are usually good but they have a quality control problem. Sometime their beef tongue (lengua) smells. Today their rice in wet burrito is under cooked: it is hard.

Please keep consistency.</review>

This is my first time here at this restaurant I'm just on Holiday vacay visiting my daughter so now she have a mexican place to go too. This place has some great reviews, the place looks clean quick and friendly services. The food is good and they put a good portion of meats. Not some places they put more rice and beans and it's pricy. I just notice that they didn't put my 2 tacos in a small paper plate instead it's just wrap in foil that looks squished. The tacos and Burrito are to go. I was hungry and wasn't able to take a picture of that:).<//text>

Overall good tacos — fresh, tender meat, flavourful corn tortillas. I got the cabeza (head) and lengua (tongue) options, and was happy with how everything tasted. Efficient service, clean restaurant, pleasant outside seating area. Solid.</Text>

This is family owned establishment has been a favorite for 4 generations. We all enjoy the way they prepare and season the entrees they offer. And the service is good. Before the covid 19 it was most enjoyable to sit and eat your meal hot.< /Review>

Delicious food. I love eating here. Though I wish they'd invest in sour cream, and guacamole to have available. Even if it costed extra. Its especially cool that they're open 24/7.<//text>

<review>Solid fast food taco joint. Open 24/7(I think). Always there for me when I'm craving tacos or a burrito late at night. They make everything super quick and the price is very affordable too. Objectively, not the best tasting tacos, but given it's convenience I'd say it's my go-to!<//review>< pictures>

<review>Super simple menu. This place is nice, it reminds me of a Mexican version of subway. Everything is layed out under glass and ready to go. It's pretty fresh and tasty. Very clean, polite staff. My only complaint is the tiny menu.

If you want tacos, real great authentic tacos, at a great price, this is your place. Your looking for selection, look elsewhere.

<review>One of the best places to get el pastor-  burrito or taco. Their carnitas and asada are both excellent too. There is little to no ambience to this place, but I do feel safe. The drive-through is a good option. While the food quality is very high, the ambience is very low.< /review>< resp>

This used to be an el conejo back in the day. It still pretty much is. Great mexican food and they are open late (stoner's dream). Everything there is pretty good.

The only exception is the carnitas. The flavor is mild and the moisture is that of the high desert. I only get it on an all bean wet burrito.<//text>

The steak nachos are the best! The Horchata is decent too. But price is more on higher side and portions on smaller side.< /Text>

<review>Killer tacos and burritos oh and the hidden menu items are equally as good if your in the know! So next time you check Taqueria De Anda in Fullerton think about adding cheese to that next burrito or crema (Mexican sour cream) both items are on site but not advertised so just ask and they will hook you up!

Also explore the items outside of your comfort zone especially in regards to your proteins! They have several options with regards to this such as lingua or cabeza which should be pretty self explanatory even not speaking Spanish! For reals there is other portions of meat we never try and they are actually really good, tender and lean (lingua)  they have a great flavor and what's it gonna cost you a buck or so to try something your likely really going to like!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Update

I've been around a little since my last review below. The last review I gave on this place was 4 starts. Since then, I've had many tacos at many places. The tacos here are the best!! If you haven't been here, do yourself a favor and try this place out. Five stars!!
----------
Always open and always serving great tacos.<//Text>

If you are in the mood for simple Mexican food that tastes good and is inexpensive, this is the place. It's hard to find a good taco and burrito fast and sometimes that's all you want, right? This is my go-to spot.</Text>

Really great Mexican place! You get exactly what you would expect from any other taqueria. I do really love the 2-meat option burrito because it's fun to mix'n'match and not be limited to one meat choice, even though I got 2 types of pork. What can I say, pork is amazing.

Fair pricing and a perfectly filling portion. I left feeling very satisfied. It looks small from the outside but inside there is a lot of space so it doesn't get too crowded.</text>

<text>Food is ok but service is not so good. They are not very friendly, and I ordered a carne asada burrito and asked for beans with it, yes had to ask for them because they make it without beans. They charged me .65 cents more for beans only to find out once I got home there were no beans in the burrito.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80dcd9f975570c23:0x3332fdb661d6aabd</GmapID></record>

<Review>Without a question my favorite late night food.

I've been eating here for so many years and always recommend going there when someone is new to the area. They totally fill your burritos to the point where they almost fall apart!

<review>The restroom here is right there off the main dining area. Who ever came up with that layout wasn't trying very hard.

The last time I went there was a flood in the restroom - and, due to the wonky layout, the flood extended into the main dining area.

The bean burritos were yummy.</review></record>

Good Mexican food but slightly more expensive than other taquerias in the area.  Convenient drive thru though.  Nice option of having no rice and beans in your burrito too.  Two types of salsa, red and green.  I prefer the red, not as sour as the green and it is a little spicier.< /text>

Great mexican food! Never gross fatty chunks of meat in my burritos or tacos. Always fresh and made right in front of you how you like it. Red salsa is the perfect amount of spicy! I drive from corona almost every weekend just for a carne asada burrito.</Text>

This place is one of the best in my opinion in the local area, meaning the city of Orange and off of Chapman.

The carne asada tacos and burritos are the best choices in my opinion. Check it out for yourself 👍

*For a 2 meat burrito, I highly recommend asking them to "double wrap it with 2 tortillas 😉</text>

This is the best tacos de anda, they give you more meat than the other locations. safe location,  and the red sauce does not have as much of the pepper spice as the one in La habra or fullerton. only negative is they don't have radishes on their condiment bar.</Review>

Good dirty Mexican food for when you're drunk or craving a huge burrito to stuff your face. This place is cheap and bomb. They have all your favorite meats from chicken to carne and carnitas. The tacos are bomb too.<//review>

<Text>My second visit in one month to this place and the meat (Asada) seemed so dry and tasteless. That's why I only give them 3 stars. They seem to cook so much at one time that they have to keep the meat in the warmer, meanwhile its drying out

Another thing I noticed was the quality of the tortilla has degraded. They use cheap tortillas that breaks apart on the first bite, making them useless. Because you end up using a fork to eat your meat. 😐</Text>< Pictures>

If you want some SoCal authentic Mexican food and you want it cheap then go here. Their portions are huge and their meat is greasy, but their veggies may or may not be the freshest around. The burritos and quesadillas seem to be the most popular items, both being oversized and absolutely stuffed with meat. Both the beef and chicken are tasty, I haven't ventured into the beef tongue yet! Don't expect a huge variety here though, they pretty much just have a couple salsas, cheese, onions and cilantro.<//review>

<text>All your taco dreams come true here. Classic hole-in-the-wall Mexican food restaurant. It’s not commercialized and it has an open kitchen. They had some much meat there, I thought they had just killed a cow. The food was fresh and ready. Their carnitas were amazing. Carne asada was ok, but it wasn’t busy when I was there, so it might not have been the freshest stuff. My friend goes all the time and he loves it though.< /text><response>None</response><Time>1521353168116<//Time>< gmap_id>

Drive thru is a joke. They only give you one sauce for your whole order and when you ask them for more they give you attitude.</Review>

It's supposed to be a taqueria which means salsa a lo mexicano. I was really disappointed.  My Agua fresca de horchata tasted terrible. Maybe I am picky.< /Review>< resp>

Taqueria De Anda is one of those places.  It's open 24 hours and make some of the best burritos you can ask for.  I'm making myself hungry just thinking about them right now. They have all the regular favorites like burritos and street tacos (that are also very good).  My only weird complaint is that they do not have guacamole for some reason.  Sometimes I like a little guac with my mexican food, oh well.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Nasty place!! Big water roaches🐌 in the undyne in area I can just imagine the kitchen ... And the price for the food is ridiculous and when they wrap it with foil they really do you wrap it in foil that's all you get is foil!!! A large taquito is what you get!! Sad I always loved this place but I would rather dine-in somewhere nice then spend that kind of money here...< /Text>

I dropped by on Saturday   and purchased a carne asada burrito along with a few tacos for my wife.  By the end of the day, my wife stomach was turning and it didn't take long before we were both vomiting.  This was the only meal we had all day, and we walked away with food poisoning.

I will never go back to this particular Taqueria de Andas, their quality control sucks, there are other places in the area, try  Bahia Mexican food down the street or just keep driving.

I hate writing a negative review, but I've never been so sick after eaten at a restaurant.<//Text>
