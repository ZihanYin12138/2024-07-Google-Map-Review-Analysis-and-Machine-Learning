< Review>
I have used ShadePro three times. The first two times were satisfactory. The third time the total opposite - I upgraded to a longer lasting awning and new springs. I watched as the installer put in old, rusty springs. He told me that you could no longer get new springs and that I was only charged HALF price for the used ones while the receipt I have on hand shows I was charged $258 for the two springs. The price for new ones, I found and ordered directly from Weekend Warrior, is $96 for the right and slightly more for the left. They also said they would not warrantee the old springs for more than "one or two times" the awning was used. I did speak to someone in the office who then tried to tell me that I was only charged $15 for the springs despite what the receipt for parts showed and the rest of the $258 in fact went to more labor... total BS. They have since refused to install the new springs I paid for directly from Weekend Warrior and refund me for the used springs.  I have requested on more than one occasion to speak to a supervisor, manager and owner, and they also refused that so the issue will go on as unresolved. Photo I included shows the receipt ($1116.53 Total) with 2 charges of $129.00 for each USED spring.<//Review>

<text>I ordered the shades for my RV due to the recommendation of many of my fellow rv’ers.  The ordering process was easy, though I had to settle for an 8ft awning instead of the  9ft since it wasn’t a stock item.  I received what I thought was my entire order in a timely manner.  When I received my order, I was short the 8ft shade.  I called and spoke to Justin who was the absolute rudest person.  I asked about my missing part of the order and was told that the order was in production.  I was confused by this since I thought this was a stocked product.  I had called the weekend before to verify what I needed to order.  I have a 10 ft and 18ft awning.  I was able to get the 17 ft, but to get a 9ft, I would have to have it made.  So when I was told that the one I thought was in stock would have to be made, I asked if I could have it changed by the 9ft.  He told me he didn’t know where it was in production and would have to speak to someone Monday.  I asked to clarify if he was calling me back or I needed to call back and that’s when he got ugly and very rude.  To the point he hung up on me.  My husband and I were so angry that we immediately cancelled my remaining order and told him we wanted a refund.  I don’t care  what quality their product is.  A good company that does excellent business would never allow an employee to speak to a customer the way this guy did.  I recommend to anyone reading this, do not order from this company.  Choose another company that respects their customers.  No one should have experience what we did.  My husband looked them up on the BBB and they are C-and accredited.  Lesson learned, do more research before you order.

Update:  I did get the screen I ordered custom 9x10 and it came quickly.  Their product is good, customer service was lacking.  I would have given them a 5 if it wasn’t for my altercation with Justin.< /text>< user_id>

<rating>2</rating><text>I purchased an awning room from ShadePro and had a zipper issue. Under warranty, someone was sent to fix the problem. Long story short, I was extremely dissatisfied with their customer service protocol, since Kevin (repairman) arrived at my residence on 3/5/21 at a time I was not quoted, didn't inform me he was at my residence, and made himself at home without my permission. After speaking to Justin (Supervisor) I was promised a full refund of the original purchase price of $660.51 as soon as the product was returned. Trevor collected the product on 3/6/21. I was promised the full refund of $660.51 within ten business days when I spoke to Michelle on 3/8/21. No refund. I called on 3/22/21 and spoke to Michelle again. Michelle informed me that the owner, Steve, had stopped the refund. I was surprised at this action. I informed Michelle that I still wanted my full refund. I still have not received my full refund.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80d95f419ea2cdf9:0x47fd95aa97798511<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Fixed the tension on an awning we had installed back in Oregon.  Steve was awesome, quick and efficient, and even gave us some tips about using it the right way! I will call Shade Pro in an INSTANT next time we need awnings....hmmm maybe I better think about a little awning over our slide out! Thanks!< /Review>

My wife and I replaced two windows, one living room and the main awnings.  ShadePro was very professional and helpful, I made an error in the sizing and they fix it and sent the awning back.  Great customer and fast service.</review>

I purchased a shade pro add a room in July. It arrived quickly and the quality of the product and support team is excellent. That is more than I can say for the competition that couldn't even provide me a shipping date. This is a great addition to our Camper. I did request a replacement pole and it was immediately sent out no questions asked. I will not hesitate to do business with them again.</text>

Shade Pro came thru when others couldn't or wouldn't. When checking RV for an up coming trip, I found awning coming apart. I called ???? for a replacement. They sent the wrong size. When called they said send it back we can't help you. A call to Shade Pro not only got me the correct size, they were able to get it to me in the then shortened time period. They for sure will have my future business.</review>

Excellent job from the Team! Ryan installed new slide-topper vinyl and 3 completely new awnings (12' and 2 6'). Late in the day and losing sunlight, couple of 'techs' stopped by to help wrap it up. Awesome job, they really know their stuff. Awesome price too! Highly recommended.<//review>

He no sooner started and so did the rain. The poor guy was soaked but he kept on. Steve was very professional and explained everything to both of us upon completion. So nice to be able to put our awning in and out without having to bring the slide in every time.  He cleaned everything up when he was done and the old awning was taken away. We would recommend Shade Pro and Steve. Thank you< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

First time using Shadepro,  Do not use this company. Poor communication, order not received as promised 7 days past shipping date. I contacted shadepro and they said they were out of material, and of course no one contacted me to tell me so. My credit card was charged before product was even made or shipped. Did not offer any resolution to keep me as a customer. Was hung upon when trying to get refund. Horrible service,  do not purchase or use this company.

This is an update to the service I received from ShadePro. Not often I’m reluctant to change my review, but ShadePro went out of their way to win me over as a customer and make things right. I also had posted on their Facebook page which I will update as well. ShadePro contacted me immediately asked what it would take to make things right and apologized for the poor service I received and lack of communication. They came through with all of my request and products were received when promised. Now that I have installed their products, they look great and quality is awesome. Thanks ShadePro< /Text>

Had to use ShadePro twice in the last few months, once in Congress, AZ and then this week in Menifee,CA  Jeremy did a quick and professional Awning install and  Steve installed our Windshield motorhome shade. Steve and Jeremy are hard workers and they do not mess around, excellent work and quality product at a great price. I highly recommend ShadPro...Thanks!<//Review>

<Text>While I had great hope for the Vista Shade End Panel, I ended up being significantly disappointed in it. First the hanging rod sent with it was woefully too short and I don't have the tallest RV. They sent another which was just barely long enough. But the rod is pretty much worthless trying to hang a loop onto a hook 6 or so feet above on the RV. It may take 3 or 4 hours and luck to get it attached and by that time you would have taken out your tall ladder to do it anyway. I built my own hanging tool with two prongs a half inch apart to hold the loop open while hanging the loop on the hook and it works well. And the hanger attachments themselves are poorly designed for hanging a loop. In addition, the hanger attachments on the roller tube are made of plastic and absolutely break the first time you use them. They are absolutely worthless. The did send a metal one designed for it and one not, which I was forced to use. The tie downs were also pretty much a joke and I ended up making my own. But the final thing was the actual use which was hopped to produce a modestly significant reduction in sun intensity behind the sun screen. While it did reduce the intensity some, it is really not enough to be of much value. I suspect that if they use the same screen for the side screens, their value would also be minimal. My recommendation, don't waste your money and time.< /Text></record>

Installed it, then realized It will not work. Called customer service and sent pics of the problem. They said since it’s already installed there is nothing they can do. I installed it wrong apparently. Ok, then how do I fix it? Nothing. Nobody can say what I did wrong or how to fix it, but it’s my fault and there is nothing they can do. They did send a replacement part that had absolutely nothing to do with the problem. Customer service doesn’t know the product, are rude, and very condescending. I’ll change my review if the “Lead Technician” that is supposed to contact me tomorrow has an answer but I doubt it. I’m also going to contact Allstate and advise them of the issue.</text>< pics>

Their service tech named Dillon recently installed slide out toppers for me in Quartzsite. I would have easily given 5 stars except that Dillon had to make an extra trip because the original fabric was cut incorrectly. Dillon had to re-order the fabric and this delayed the install 2 days. I don't think the error was his. I did watch Dillon take measurements of the slide out's depth before ordering, so I suspect the warehouse made the error cutting the fabric too short. If I'd had plans to travel this could have been pretty inconvenient.

Dillon provided excellent service. I couldn't have been more pleased with his work and his work ethic. And I am very happy with the products that I purchased. I purchased the acrylic fabric and expect long service from these toppers.

I will probably be purchasing other products from ShadePro in the future.<//text>

<text>Ordered a 14 ft. replacement fabric. What arrived was a 16 ft. fabric in a different color.

The box had TWO stickers on it - one referenced my order and the other someone else's.

ShadePro refused to reimburse me for the consequential damages I incurred even though they admitted the error was 100% their fault.

I hope to one day get my $174 back.

Deal with these idiots at your own peril.</text></record>

updated and amended review, in fairness I left original problem to explain...

Ron, senior tech was sent out the day after my third and final attempt to resolve.   He was extremely knowledgeable and actually cared about my dissatisfaction. He agreed the canopy was too long and was not correct. I assisted him in removing two of the aluminum slats on the Alimiguard. This shortened the canopy by approx 5 inches which removed the slack, he soaped the arm to assist in sealing the stitching holes. He added additional support rivets for arms (only tip and bottom were originally  installed). Net result: canopy looks and works great, thanks to Ron.   quality products only are quality if properly installed. Kudos to the gentleman at customer service I spoke to this third time as well. He too cared nd didn’t give me the BS about “that is just how awnings are”
great product and yes superior design to Dometic original awning (when properly intalled)

Original complaint.
I recently (1 month ago) had my Dometic Awning replaced by Shadepro.  I had window awnings put on by them the year before and was very pleased with them so I thought I would go ahead and use them to replace the flimsy Dometic. Boy was that a mistake!
The awning they put on seemed sturdy enough but I too noticed the canopy was too long.   I was told by the technician that you must roll it in a bit to tighten it.  I found that odd and now my new $1700 awning doesn’t go out as far.   I thought surely this was a mistake and called the service number. They sent a tech out the following week and he told me the exact same thing the installation tech told me.  So now I have to roll canopy about 8” just to take the slack out.  Even so, with the metal cover I was encouraged to opt for, the metal cover is too heavy and causes canopy to droop. Water not pools on my canopy. When bringing this to Shadepro’s attention, I was told that “anyone who tells you that the awnings are for rain and drain are lying to you”.  The capacity also leaks all along the seam where the cloth meets that  metal cover.   I am very very sorry I got this installed.  My vinyl Dometic was much better and did indeed work in the rain.  Very frustrated...  I have them a 2 star instead of 1 because of my previous satisfaction with the smaller window awnings...<//Text>

We are so happy with our new front end window coverings. Can now keep the shades open and enjoy the view. We also purchased the tire covers, So much easier than the ones that you have to get down on hands & knees to install. These take 4 clips and you are finished! At the same time we ordered the dash cover. Wonderful! We travel with a bird, she stays on the front dash when parked. Cleanup of her seed shells and downy feathers is so easy now. Thank you ShadePro.<//Text>

Had gone to Camping World and was dissatisfied by their response.  Went back to RV - sent e-mail to shade pro and Jerad Mattingly was at our RV site within an hour.  He measured our area for the two awnings, advised that we could have exactly what we wanted.  Suggested that the bigger awning could be 11'9" which basically went the length of the slide.  Showed us a color match to our current automatic awning.  When we advised we would be in a different RV park in a week, he said he would deliver to the new site and install.  He met us at the new park, installed both awnings in very short order.  Perfect service, perfect product, VERY VERY pleased.  Highly recommend!!</review>

I ordered and received a Vista Shade for Electric RV Awning from Shade Pro for $169.00.
I like the design but I have a major issue with the quality.
Shade Pro stated that it reduced sunlight by 85%.
Unfortunately it does not come close to an 85% reduction.  A quick look at the cloth I received makes it obvious that it cannot be 85%. It is too loosely woven.
I sent two emails to customer service starting on 3-13-2017 stating the problems noted above and have not gotten any response.  I asked if Shade Pro has a more densely woven cloth that can provide more shading which is needed for hot Florida summer days.<//Review>

<review>Shade Pro came to me and installed windshield covers on my RV. The tech was extremely efficient and professional and the price was reasonable.  The only reason I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the stitching could have been a little better. I spent quite a while with scissors cutting the extra hanging thread. Thanks Trevor, my RV looks great.<//review>< Pictures>

My neighbors had just had ShadePro install a RV awning and were thrilled with the product and service...so I had them give me an estimate on  three slide awnings on our 5th wheel. Pricing was very competitive, so we ordered and installed. Ken was our installer. Very knowledgable and very professional. Extremely pleased with the company and installation. As soon as they completed this, we asked for an estimate on window sun screens. Too early to review on product durability, but so far...great!<//Review>

<Review>I ordered a dash cover for my Dynasty from you in January at Quartzsite,  It didn't fit.  You sent a pattern maker to my coach and he made a pattern specifically for my unit.  I received the product via UPS a couple of weeks later and it fit perfectly.  Thank you so much this great customer service.</Review>< Rate>

UPDATE:  I decided to stick it out and work through the scheduling issues with Shadepro.  I was extremely impressed that Ken came out during bad weather, was extremely professional knowledgeable and super friendly. You won me over Ken and the awning looks great and works better. Increased my rating to 4 Stars. Thanks guys Ken Rocks!!!! And Luis is Customer Service should be cloned.

Where do I begin. Worst service I have ever experienced. I will let everyone I know not to use Shadepro services.  After 3 weeks and two appointments I still do not have an awning installed. I was assured it was in stock and ready to be installed when I was called the morning the installer was to arrive and told so sorry we couldn't find it. We will come to you wherever you are to install it and guess what?  They don't travel to Acton. I am livid!!!! All I get is oh we are soooooo sorry. Your service sucks your people are not knowledgeable.  I have 3 people waiting to see how this awning service turned out. I will advise them to go elsewhere. Horribly disappointing. I can't believe a company treats people this way.</text>

Our slide topper broke on Wednesday last week, we called Shade Pro and Ron Butts was here Thursday morning. They gave us a quote we accepted and he promised to return on Wednesday to fix it up. He was here (Quartzsite LTVA) on time and the price was as quoted. Great friendly service.< /review>

I sent the following letter to the Shade Pro website "contact us" 5 days ago and have not had a response. It was reworded slightly as it was directed to them however the content was exactly the same. At least we aren't out any money! I had to give them 1 star or else I couldn't post.

I made an appointment through the owner of Shade Pro Mike at their booth in Quartzsite, AZ.  last January 16th  to have our awning material and motor replaced. I gave him the make and length of our awning on our Montana 5th wheel, one of the most common RV’s on the road. The following week the service tech shows up with a 2 piece awning instead of a 1 piece. I was never asked if ours was a 1 or a 2 piece awning. The service tech got on the phone and said that they needed material for a 1 piece 9100 and was told that it would have to be made and it would be about a week. He also quoted $499 for a new motor but said another option was a used motor for $100. I said I would go with a used one.
More than a week went by with no phone call so I stopped at their booth again and spoke to a lady. She said the material wasn’t in yet and that it would be the first week in February. After again hearing nothing into the second week of February I phoned on the 10th and the customer service rep said he didn’t show anything about the material and motor but showed our appointment was for 9 am February, 14th. Just to be certain there wasn’t going to be another screw up I phoned again on the 13th and spoke with the same fellow. He assured me that everything was ready for my appointment the next day.
A different service tech shows up, again with the wrong awning material! He also told me the motors are $799 and that they don’t carry or sell used motors! He checks his computer and doesn’t find anything that was ordered with the first service tech. He’s pissed and I’m pissed so he gets on the phone to clear things up. He enters a new order and prints me out an installation order for the following Saturday at 9 am on the 18th.
As it turned out the 18th was a stormy day so we were expecting the courtesy of a phone call to reschedule. As of the 27th we’ve yet to hear anything from Shade Pro. Never before in 7 years of full time RVing have I dealt with such an incompetent company!

<review>We had a bad experience when my fiancé had injured his foot. We went in for X-rays and everything was okay but had bad swelling and pain. The PA prescribed him a muscle relaxer and an anti-inflammatory. The meds made him very sick that he could not take anymore. The next day we called to get the prescription changed and they would not change without going back in and having to pay for another visit. Okay we get it but the lady who was speaking to him was not nice at all. I saw on Yelp this place has a low rating and now because of this we will never go back. Bad treatment.< /review>< pictures>

Extremely slow.. went for a travel only covid PCR test and barely anyone in waiting room yet waited for almost 2 hours to be seen by a doctor to be travel tested? Seriously. Only needed a negative test. Do not recommend for a 20 second test, go elsewhere.</Review>

The staff and building is very nice. That's why I'm not giving a one star. But if you are planning to get your COVID-19 test, DO NOT TEST HERE! Got my test done on 12/02/20 and it's now 12/08/20 and still no results. First I was told 2-3 days for results, then was told it can take the full 5 days; now I'm being told the lab can take up to 7 business days, not including the weekend. Sure sounds like the good old run around to me. Go to Priority Urgent Care if you need results in a timely manner; 2 friends got their results within 3 days and they did the test after me.<//Review>

The office was nice, the staff was nice. Getting important lab results in a timely matter is what is bothering me, especially when other sites are able to get the same results in a fraction of the time.
So far it is 6 days, no results given to me. Where other family went somewhere else and got them much quicker. I mean these are important but I have not got any calls, I have been checking in constantly.< /review>

As a healthcare worker being on the other end as a patient, this experience was baffling. I could hear the medical assistants speaking about me, the Neurosurgeon I work for called and asked the staff/providers the situation, the staff was mocking him and I could hear them. I was notified of my positive results by a young lady, " you have tested positive, okay". Like....your facility ordered this diagnostic testing, you have to see it through. It was abnormal, it wasn't sent to my PCP; I wasn't given any advice as to what to do. I wasn't offered any help in regards to starting a zpack, I wasn't advised to try vitamins, I wasn't given any information on how I could stay safe at home. I wasn't told to isolate or quarantine. NOTHING!! As a medical office, you should be ashamed and embarrassed. How can you do this to your patients, to a community that is struggling? You are part of the problem. Dr. Dan Erickson & Dr. Artin Massihi are comfortable with this type of service? I have to say, I see why so many people take healthcare as a joke and the virus keeps spreading. It is because facilities LIKE ACCELERATED URGENT CARE.</review>

Everyone that worked there and helped me were extremely helpful and understanding. Everybody seemed to be in a great mood and happy to help me. Front desk to the back. Doctor Mendez was very nice and helped me with my asthma and other urgent condition. It was a very positive experience as I have a lot of anxiety about going to see a doctor. I will definitely come back again if I need an urgent visit.<//text>

This urgent care is amazing. ALL staff members were very friendly, efficient, and very helpful. I was even referred to a primary doctor in the same building and they got me a follow up appointment in a couple days. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.

This location never answers the phone. I understand why my results are taking long, I see how busy they are, but how can a phone not be answered at least one time after consecutive days of calling. Also my results were lost and when I called the lab they said they were sent to this urgent care, and I can call coffee to have them refaxed over, but couldn’t get a hold of them so I called brimhall. When explaining to them my situation I was still pushed aside and not given any answers. There was no sense of urgency at either locations I came into contact with.</text>

<review>I went to Accelerated Urgent Care very ill with Bronchitis, Laryngitis and other symptoms on January 2nd.  From the front registration desk to the process of going to the patient room to see the doctor, I was treated so well and respect-full.

Also, the Urgent Care facility was so very clean and comfortable.  I will definitely come to this urgent care for my urgent care needs.

Thank you to all the staff that made my visit pleasant when I felt so ill.  Thank you for your time and your care.  You definitely expressed that you care for your patients.

Gratefully,

We have never been treated so poorly and left with zero diagnosis. Today my daughter was seen by Lisa Mendez. Since Sunday she has been running a fever with a sore throat, green mucous, sore ears, extremely fatigued. When we first got there all of the other staff were friendly and helpful. They had asked us if we wanted her tested for Covid and we said that if the doctor felt it was necessary then we would like to go ahead and have it. When Lisa walked in the room there was no how are you feeling or what can we do for you today... she came in the room and said “so are you getting the Covid test or not? What do you need?” I was a little thrown off by how rude she was about it. So I started to tell her what was going on with my daughter. I also told her that on our way there we got a call from her primary doctor stating that she had had some blood work done on Monday because she hadn’t been feeling well and they had called to let us know that her liver enzymes and her white blood cell were elevated and they wanted more blood work. They told us that it could be Epsteinbarr. Lisa looked at her throat and ears pushed on her side told her her lymph nodes were swollen and again asked if she wanted the Covid test. I told her if she felt it necessary then yes. Even after having a fever now since Sunday (she didn’t have a fever when we got there because she took meds prior) and coughing green mucous she ignored all the things we came in there for and still had her do Covid to rule that out. When I told her that her primary wanted more blood work but we weren’t sure if she would be testing her for Covid today she said “well we can rule Covid out”. If that’s the case why did she test her? She then left the room and didn’t tell us what could be going on with my daughter at all. I asked the nurse who came to walk us out if my daughter needed any antibiotics or if she diagnosed her with anything. The nurse asked if she told me anything and I told her no. The nurse went and asked her and came back and apologized and said she told her to tell me if we needed anything else to go to my primary. I have never in my life gone to the doctor to not find out anything! Green mucous, fever, something is going on! But her concern was to hurry up, be annoyed that we were there and very rude with any question I asked and then ignore what we were there for only to test her for Covid and tell her to go to her primary!!! It’s the weekend! Now my daughter is covered in a rash! I won’t go back! If you go here DO NOT SEE LISA MENDEZ! She doesn’t care about you and just wants to get you outta there so she can move on with her day! I’m so disappointed and now have to spend another copay to see someone else! Ridiculous! The worse part is when I called to tell my husband about our experience he said “ I wonder if it was Lisa Mendez, she’s been known to be rude like that. I looked it up and sure enough. Sad. She has a reputation apparently and unfortunately my daughter had to experience her ignorance.</text>

I hurt my knee earlier that day and came here because my husband had had 2 previous occasions to come here and the service was fantastic.  The doctor seemed interested and caring. However when I was there on Friday 9/13 I had quite the opposite experience.  The nurses and receptionist were great but the doctor was horrible.  She Didn’t seem at all interested in my pain.  She briefly looked at my knee, said it wasn’t broken, and then asked if I wanted to X-ray it when I didn’t seem pleased with her.   She said it couldn’t be broken if I could walk on it.  (I once walked on a fractured ankle for 2 weeks).  After the X-ray she came back and said it was broken and the started to leave.  I had to ask what was wrong with it then.  Was it strained or sprained?  She said yes do you want me to wrap it for you.  And then did the worst job of wrapping up a sprain I’ve ever seen.  She didn’t offer a prescription for painkillers or anything to help ...... and I was in a great deal of pain.  I hadn’t even wanted to go to the doctor but my husband and daughters insisted.  I wish I hadn’t wasted my time.</text>

Went for a Covid test because I was showing symptoms. It's been over a week and I still haven't gotten my results back and when you call the office to get the results, no one answers the phone and you can't even leave a message. I've been calling for days, multiple times. My husband got tested the same day at a different location and received his test result (he had to call the location). I'm waiting to get the results back because I need to go back to work. Terrible - go somewhere else for testing.< /Text>

<Review>Fastest and friendliest visit I've had so far. The location is fairly new so it's clean and when I visited, it was empty. The receptionist was friendly and showed manners when having to answer the phone as I signed my paper work. When my vitals were being taken the gentleman was kind and answered any questions that I had in regards to my BP and their apparatus to check the lungs. Dr. Lemus was kind and efficient. Overall a great experience and if I ever need a fast/friendly visit, I will be using this facility. Keep it up!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80ea438b7396dddd:0xa6e40332cc7fd1a6<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Worst place to go, I waited more than 3 hours to get seen, girls in the front were slow and it wasn't as busy. I seen people coughing and not being careful, the facility needs to separate the people with any symptoms because there were children that couldn't keep there masks on. Not once during I was here seen anyone cleaning and wiping the waiting area.</review><gmapID>0x80ea438b7396dddd:0xa6e40332cc7fd1a6</gmapID>< user_id>

I’ve been coming to Accelerated for a while now and was checked in by a lovely receptionist. I was in a bad mood when I waked in and she brightened my day. Thank you Alyssa for being so kind. Thank you to Dr. Mendez for taking care of me. There is essentially no wait time. I recommend anyone to come to Accelerated.< /review>

<Text>The Dr talked so fast I could barely understand, it was obvious he wanted to check another patient off the list (office was quite slow by the way). Didn't care to listen to previous history relating to patient issue, and left room within 2 minutes after I had waited in all, over 45 mins since they don't have an online check in. If he bothered to invest even a tiny bit of time talking to the patient, I would not feel the need to post a complaint, but it was astounding how unengaged he was. Other accelerated urgent cares have been just fine, but this new one was not impressive in relation to the doctor experience.<//Text>< pics>

Very glad to have brought my mom here. Everyone was very kind. The provider was really knowledgeable and respectful. Not to mention the receptionist, right off the bat she offered us water which no one ever does at ANY clinic we've ever stepped foot in, and also offered my nieces and nephews coloring paper and crayons while we waited to be called back. I will definitely be recommend this place to everyone I know.< /text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I am very displeased with the lack of care I received from accelerated UC. On 11/12/2019, I called in and spoke to a receptionist to verify that my insurance was accepted. I specifically ask the receptionist to run my member ID, she declined to do so and stated, “If I have a PPO, they accept them all.” With that being said, I trusted her advice and I came in after work. I signed all the paperwork, paid my co-pay and waited about two hours to be seen, it wasn’t seemingly busy. Once called back, I waited an additional 30 minutes for a doctor to see me. I explained my symptoms and history with them and stated I had this same illness several months back and received two shots and an antibiotic to help. The doctor stated that although this has happened before, he wasn’t going to proceed the same way. He said he’ll give me one of the shots and a z-pack, as a medical professional, I followed his direction. Waited an additional 20-30 minutes for the shot and release.

After finishing the antibiotics, I didn’t feel that symptoms had gone away fully but didn’t have time to return to be seen a second time. I felt ok enough to get by and figured they would go away on their own. Fast forward to today, I found out that Accelerated UC deducted $376 from my account for unpaid “patient responsibility”. I called Anthem and they stated that this was an “out-of-Network urgent care”. This is my fault to have trusted the word of the receptionist and not verifying on my own. I’m sadden that I cannot trust their employees to provided adequate information upon request….the receptionist DENIED my requested to verify that they are a covered UC from my insurance and failed to left me know at the time of my visit. As a sick patient, they should have taken better care but all they truly care about is profit. This is a bad urgent care and staff, do not take their word….verify with your own insurance prior to visiting.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80ea438b7396dddd:0xa6e40332cc7fd1a6</gmap_id></record>

Came in for a second opinion on my daughter's ankle because the first doctor said it was sprained. Come to find out it was definitely fractured. Accelerated urgent care sent her x-rays out to get another opinion. Thanks so much!!</review>

Was asked what insurance and I responded with the name. Clerk gave me a clipboard and said fill out these papers. Afterwards, another couple came in and the same was asked with the same response. Clerk then tells them they don’t accept that insurance at this location. At that point the clerk looks at me holding the completed paperwork and says, “Oh, I guess I wasn’t thinking...” Incompetent service and waste of time. No wonder they didn’t have any customers. Clerk runs them off.</text>

I learned a system that I think is accidental. Go before their lunch break and you'll get a competent doctor that will actually help you and take you seriously. Go after lunch and you're more likely to wait an hour for a nurse that will just give you a perception and send you off. Pretty much: try going as early as possible. Just be careful not to go to close to lunch in the AM hours. I accidentally made the doctor delay his lunch and it lead to him being in a hurry to get me out which I couldn't blame him for.< /text>

Wait time did not take long... I don't know if that's normal for them or if it was because of the insurance I have... The doctor or nurse practitioner (Laura hastings) that seen me was very rude not concerned really about the pain I was experiencing after being in a car accident a day prior... Complained about back pain but did not take an x-ray... Upset I wasted my $25 copay here would've been better off going to the emergency room! I will be following up with a real doctor who cares about the people they are being paid to help!!!<//review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Date>1515840589765<//Date><name>Roderick Garcia<//name><text>My experience with Accelerated Urgent Care was the worst medical care that I have had in my 65-years on earth.

I understand that being overwhelmed with flu patients is out of their control. However, I was extremely ill and misdiagnosed with the flu and ultimately hospitalized for several days for a non-flu related illness.

My ex-rays were ordered stat at 8am and the clerical staff ignored my calls for help and gave me false promises that they would call me immediately when the ex-rays arrived.

Ultimately, I had to personally go to the imaging company to track them down and was told that the ex-rays had been sent to Accelerated Urgent Care many hours earlier.

I returned to Accelerated Care and informed them that they have had my ex-rays all day despite saying they did not. The ex-ray results were right in front of the receptionist.

I was then told I had to sign back in and be charged for another office visit  and get in line behind 40 to 50 people. Approximately one hour later, the doctor informed me that I needed to go to the emergency room immediately (over 12-hours later and in very ill condition).

I was hospitalized for two days and required some very painful treatment because of the delay in medical treatment and service by Accelerated Urgent Care.

I will never return for help and would not recommend Accelerated Urgent Care to my worst enemy.< /text><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Text>I would give it a zero if I could. I called in the night before going there since I am not feeling well. I even used the Zip pass online schedule appointment by 8am in the morning. I was there prior to their opening hours. They opened late like 8:15am and we were like 7 people in the parking area waiting. There are 2 lines. One for walk in patients and one is for those people who have set their schedule online via zip pass. I was first in line and the other one just walked in and fall into that line. I am the only one who was in the zip pass appointment line and the receptionist didnt call me first. They don't prioritize you even if you had your appointment schedule set. Poor customer service. I also paid cash with my copay and they still wanted a credit or debit card to save on file. Mind you this is my 2nd time going here. Waited like another 10-20 mins and was waiting to be seen. Oh well, lesson learned. I'm not going back here anymore.< /Text><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

Went to this urgent cars 3 times and was misdiagnosed each time. First time I was told upper respiratory infection, came back in 2 days later with fever and chest pain and was told I needed breathing treatments, zpak, and that I had bronchitis. I had a reaction to the
Meds and was in 3 days later to get a shot of Benedryl and prednisone. Finally saw a regular dr this week who did an X-ray (I asked for one several times at urgent care!) sure enough I have pneumonia.

It’s nice this office is very quick but due to being “accelerated” I feel like they didn’t fully check me out and try to resolve the issue.<//text>

At first I called the Brimhall office because my wife & I usually go there for Urgent Care. Seems like they were packed so they advised us to go to the UrgentCare on StockDale. So we showed up to the building it was good at first got our room not that much waiting.. until we got our Room if I'm not mistaken I waited 30 minutes to be seen when I was told there was only 1 person in front of me & that they had two Doctors on sight today. After waiting it seems like Simone Griffin came in didn't really introduce her self just stated that I have the Flu check my back/chest for whizzing. Told me she will prescribe some medicine for the flu walked out. Didn't really have empathy towards me & stated I messed up on not getting my Flu shot. When asked for doctors note she advised to go up front to ask for one when I went they stated they have to ask her to sign for one. SMH... everything was very  northodox. Wouldn't recommend if you want a good doctors visit. Very unprofessional need improvement, not only that but it seemed like every employee was in their own world & sucked at the simplest things<//text>

<text>So it's a Saturday evening my 6 year old son is very sick so i get online and making an appt on the zippass thing they have. I get there 15 mins early as instructed the girl is checking my son in and updating our info and insurance. And then she tells me ummm...your actually in collections. Ok for what cause this is the first I have heard of this. She says for something back in 2013 and she just kinda sits there messing around clicking things on the computer. Soni said are you tellling me that my sick son can't be seen until I pay the amount in collections? And she actually said YES THATS RIGHT BECAUSE YOUR ACCOUNT IS IN COLLECTIONS IF I DONT COLLECT IT BEFORE YOU SEE THE DR I CAN ACTUALLY GET IN TROUBLE FOR NOT COLLECTING IT. Wow really? So basically as far as I am concerned that is denying us medical attention right?  So pretty much all this tells me is that money is more important to them then a sick child. And they denyed him medical attention over over $40. Accerated urgent care will never that $40 from and not will I ever walk in there as a pt again. WHAT A JOKE YOU GUYS ARE. A2nd just for the record I ended up going to the pedi center and my son that you guys refused to see has bronchitis. Thank God for the great Dr Seats at the pedi center. People don't waste your time AUC. Just go to the pedi center.</text></record></dataset><record>

Small studio tucked into the Gaslamp area of downtown SD. Welcoming.

Variety of classes and other well-being activities. Room is warm (80ish) and comfortable, but not Hot 🥵

Lots of regulars and a fair number of out of town guests here for holiday or conferences.< /Review>

Pura Vida Yoga is one of the best studios I’ve ever been to. As soon as you walk in you can immediately feel the calm, welcoming, and easy-going energy all the teachers possess. All of their vinyasa classes take me to my edge and leave me dripping sweat. I would 100% recommend this studio to anyone at any level looking for a new yoga home or if they’re just visiting San Diego.< /Text>

My husband bought me the two week special for Christmas present as I used to be a regular yogi.
My first experience was great. Warm and friendly staff. The instructors are all amazing and diverse to suit my needs. As soon  as I walk through the doors I immediately feel relaxed and soothed.  The atmosphere is amazing and I would highly recommend Pura Vida yoga.< /review>

< Review>
GREAT studio - with a cool, urban location! The studio is always very clean! The staff is super welcoming and friendly too. They offer a great variety of class styles. The instructors are warm, helpful and always willing to assist or modify to fit your personal practice. I do wish they had more class times but overall very satisfied and will be back for more classes.< /Review>

It is an amazing community of welcoming yogis who thrive on supporting one another before, during and after class.

The classes vary in challenge and the instructors are quick to modify poses for ease and difficulty depending on your level of experience. I take classes around the country and I love when I find a studio that focuses on breath above all else -all of the instructors are on-point with breathing reminders throughout class which greatly benefits my entire practice.

The cork blocks are also the bomb.

I always leave feeling better than I did when I walked in.

Wonderful. Welcoming. Warm. ❤️<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I really enjoyed my Drop-in class with Nicole R. the other day. I am just visiting San Diego and my hotel was nearby. The standard and quality of the class is outstanding in my opinion. Thank you for the great experience. I will definitely come back again if I am back in town.< /review>

Great Location and Schedule.  This studio is located right in the heart of downtown and has early morning classes which is great for early risers and visitors.  The only recommendation I would have would be to have more variety in their morning offerings.</Text>

I really like this studio. It is very welcoming and I have enjoyed most of the classes and instructors. My favorite instructors are the two Nicoles! They are absolutely fabulous and have great energy. It’s worth trying but it wasn’t my favorite studio. Those two instructors make it worth coming back. The receptionist is friendly. Well, there was one time I went and the front desk person wasn’t too friendly but it wasn’t the woman I had encountered the first time. I like that they don’t have mirrors. Who wants to look at mirrors while practicing yoga? The $2 mat rental doesn’t make sense to me but that’s their choice and bottled water is $2. A little overpriced since you can get it for $1 at gas stations. Sometimes I think yoga studios milk people for money because they can. Every yoga studio I’ve gone to before this one had free mat rentals and $1 water and towels. But given the location, it makes sense that they would charge more. They also have a free community yin class and great introductory special, if you want to try it before committing to monthly.</text>

<review>I enjoyed the atmosphere and insight that each instructor brought to class. I admit I did have some difficulty but I really had a good time trying to get out of my comfort zone. I always felt a sense of calmness and awareness of my surroundings. Thanks to all the instructors for your knowledge and for sharing your practice. The only thing that I did not care for was the parking, you have to get there early to find parking and a good spot in the studio especially in the morning.< /review><Name>Isabel Torres</Name><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

Teachers and staff are well versed in their craft. Very helpful, will guide you skillfully and gently push you to your edge. Great space, great location and the studio offers a variety of classes for all skill levels. Truly a happy zen environment to be in, especially when you need a break from the craziness of everyday life. I'm so thankful to be apart of this community!<//review>

Perfect location in Gaslamp. The staff is very warm and welcoming! I love how encouraging and helpful the teachers are! As a beginner, I enjoyed how they let me move at my own pace until I was comfortable enough in the poses on my own. These classes are also a be stress reliever! I highly recommend the yin yoga classes!<//text>

<review>My sister and i stumbled across this place while visiting family in Chula vista. Eddie was warm and welcoming with a great sense of humor. The yoga class was on point with variations for all levels. I had so much fun in this class and Eddie definitely pushed me to my limit, in the best way. I highly recommend this studio if you're looking for a boost in your mood, pep in your step and a huge smile on your face + a little sweat :)< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I’ve been coming to Pura Vida Yoga for almost 3 years and I can’t say enough positive things about the studio and it’s owner Xenia!  I was pretty new to yoga when I first found this wonderful studio, the friendly and knowledgeable instructors helped me feel comfortable from the beginning.  My yoga practice has gotten much better because of Pura Vida and I am ever grateful that I found this peaceful gem nestled in our urban landscape.<//Text>

I started practicing in October after wanting to explore yoga for years. Pura Vida was conveniently close and came recommended. The atmosphere is very welcoming for all levels and there are several teachers which allows you to try different things or build a schedule around the classes you enjoy. The entry deal is really affordable and members get access to additional specialty sessions.</Review>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>This is more like a lifestyle studio instead of a yoga shala. In the middle of the class another student came and wiped & cleaned the floor around me because I was sweating too much 😁😅
No silent space before class, everyone is babbling (about the latest party and drinking) in the yoga space before class.
Suggestion to owner and teachers: more sweat & yoga teachings, less talk? 🙏🏻
Namaste.</Text>< user_id>

Hands down the best yoga studio in San Diego! Each teacher has a different style but will always deliver a solid class. Very professional yet personable.  The new student local intro special is amazing~ You can take unlimited classes for up to 14 days for just $29. Such a deal! Even if your vacationing in the area, they have a great deal for $45 which includes 3 classes and free mat rentals. The studio has a small retail area that includes everything you would need for yoga: mats, leggings, tanks, water bottles, towels, incense, and even mala beads. No other studio compares to Pura Vida!</review>

I visited the studio twice while in town for a conference. I was so grateful to find a studio that offered 6 am classes, had mats you could borrow for free, and allowed visitors to take advantage of the "$20 for 2 week" new student special. Sarah and Laura were both very welcoming and friendly. The classes were straightforward flows, with options to modify up or down as you needed. No pressure, or competition, just good yoga! The studio space is very clean and calming, despite being in the center of the bustling Gaslamp district. Will be back next time I am in town!</Review>

I have taken classes with just about all of the instructors and I love all of them, they each have something different to offer. Everyone is super helpful and nice when it comes to teaching. I tell everyone to try this place out not just for the yoga but for the other workshops they offer . The boutique has lots of useful clothing and yoga related items. Swing by if you're in the neighborhood .

<text>While my review is somewhat biased as I teach at Puravida yoga center, I have to say this place is truly special.  The owner (Xenia) has created a warm, comfortable, and inspiring space in which beginners and experts alike can practice yoga.  The studio is large and has beautiful ambient light.  It is well stocked with props which is especially nice for beginners.  The boutique is well appointed, and the introductory special (2 weeks unlimited yoga for $20) can't be beat! A gem in the heart of downtown.</text><user_name>Lora Heiner<//user_name><gmapID>0x80d95359e0fc1f75:0x40a464766963889b</gmapID><Rate>5< /Rate>< time>

Pura Vida is a wonderful new yoga studio in Downtown San Diego.  The yoga practice is thoughtful, peaceful, and challenging.  Individualized attention is given by all the teachers.

<Text>#PVY is cosmic heaven, very accessible for beginners, to more intermediate students.  Excellent staff, instructors are conscious of students, providing helpful pointers and helping them get deeper into certain stretches and their own practice; highly recommend, drop in classes offered for visitors in town< /Text>< gmap_id>

One of my favorite things about living in San Diego is Pura Vida, and to say that it’s positivly impacted my life is an understatement. This is not your average yoga studio. It is a place to find warmth and wisdom, and to get a better understanding of what it means to be part of a community. The joy and gratitude are always flowing. The teachers are fantastic and each bring something unique to the practice. There’s always a workshop, special class, or event on the horizon in this cozy little studio. I am also a huge fan of the eco-friendly practices they have in place like making cleaning solutions with vinegar and essential oils, encouraging everyone to bring reusable water bottles, and using fabric towels to clean mats instead of paper. I’m just completely obsessed. Don’t even get me started on the lovely, interesting people I’ve met! This place is a total gem. P.S. if you’ve never done yoga before, I highly recommend you start here with a gentle yoga class. I brought a friend from out of town who’d had a mildly traumatic experience with yoga a few decades ago, and couldn’t seem to try it again. Well she absolutely loved the morning gentle class with Kelly, and is now hoping to get into yoga back home! Love it.< /Review>

The atmosphere and teachers (and comfortable "warm" (80F) studio) make it stand out  as a great vinyasa option regardless. Highly recommended.</Review>< gmap_id>

LOVE this studio! Last week I was on business travel for a convention in San Diego. Stumbled upon this studio a few blocks from the convention hotels. They were so welcoming and helpful to several of us visiting...without mats! I managed to squeeze in 5 classes in 6 days. They offered us a great introductory offer at a super value. I got to take classes from three different teachers - Megan, Heather and Mike....all three were challenging in different ways. I cant wait to return to San Diego to stretch again with the folks at Pura Vida Yoga!</Review>

<Review>Pura Vida Yoga Center is beautiful, clean, open, and has amazing cork floors and all natural props.  It's great to practice in a space that is conscious of their footprint on the Earth.  The teachers at the studio are knowledgeable and super friendly.  Pura Vida is conveniently located downtown amongst all the hustle and bustle of the city and is truly an oasis of peace that I have grown to love.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I definitely would recommend trying the Gentle Flow or Yin if you are a begginer or if you up for a challenge and want to  break a sweat I would try Vinyasa 1 and 2. Lauren and Xenia are fun teachers!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I was traveling for work and purchased the 30 for $30 even though I would only be in town for a week. It is a great deal with the drop in cost being $17. I bought the pass and committed to coming every day. Win-win! The classes are true flow classes with the emphasis on breathing meditation flow (Only went to the Vinyasa Flow classes). Some studios care less about the breathing part and more about the aerobic part. Not this place. Temperature has been spot on, not to hot, not to cool. Great place to practice.<//Text></record>

San Diego is so lucky to have Pura Vida Yoga! I practice and teach in this beautiful space and always leave feeling refreshed and happy.

Because I have no idea what I am doing, I very much appreciate both their verbal and physical assistance. The small class sizes make for a very personalized session and don't allow anyone to get lost in the crowd. Plus parking is free in Horton Plaza when you validate and they have class times to accommodate anyone's hectic schedule... so NO excuses for not going!

Having enjoyed all instructors classes, I must say they not only offer a great class but a more spiritual,social and  positive based environment. Always welcoming, making you feel like an old friend and supplying a zenfull yet challenging class, I highly recommend this studio.
To the family at PuraVida, thank you for creating a Utopia of a retreat.<//text>< date>

I recently scheduled a tour at Belmont Station with Leasing Specialist John Worsham. He is very informative and will take the time to answer all of your questions, no matter how many (I had a lot). John's customer service is superb and he will follow up when more apartments became available. He is an absolute delight to talk to. Finding a place to live can be a bit stressful and requires a lot of research and John makes the process easier. He is the best leasing specialist I've had during my apartment search in LA. So if you're looking to live at Belmont Station, ask for John, he will take care of you.< /Text>

I don't like doing negative reviews, but I had to do this one.

After being a tenant for more than 12 months with no issues whatsoever, when I announced I wanted to move-out the Belmont Station administration (Essex portfolio) decided to retroactively increase the rent for my 1BR from (increase of over $1,000 month).

Beware of this place, seriously. They are nice and friendly as you sign your lease but behave as dirty scammers on the way out :-(< /text>

I lived here for almost 2 years. At first I thought it was great. But then almost every week the elevator would be out of service. It was ridiculous. No lie almost every or every other week the elevator would just stop working.

***Plus don't count on getting any of your deposit back. After I gave up my deposit they tried to charge me another $1,500 dollars claiming that the walls needed to be repainted. Who charges over a $1,000 to paint interior walls? Definitely not there maintenance crew**

There are many better options in DTLA than Belmont Station Apartments. Especially for the price they charge! You can find something with more than a tiny jacuzzi and pool for a much better price! Trust me!<//text>

I have been living at this apartment for almost a year now. I am completely satisfied with it. Staff are vey nice, Wendy and John have been so helpful since the day I moved in.
It has great amenities, the gym is not crowded at all. And they have free yoga class every night. My apartment is facing the court yard and it is very quite. Great parking spots. Maintenance services are good. Most importantly, I like the park across the street. It is so convenient to have a slow jogging or to walk your dog. The Echo Park is also very close by.

I saw people giving bad reviews complaining about the elevator and package service, but I did not have any problems so far.

I highly recommend this apartment.<//Text>

Management at this place is what kills it.
They just dont care.
DO NOT BRING YOUR DOG HERE!!!
Besides there being nothing to do within walking distance.

My wife and I lived here for 1 year, paid about $3g/month for a nice loft, and were asked not to renew because we called animal control services after repeated vicious attacks by pit-bulls that are allowed to live at this complex.
Dogs were bitten, hospitalized. Residents were bitten.
What did Management do?

Put up signs denying any liability and kicked us out when we called Animal Control.

This place deserves 0 stars.</review>

what a great setting, downtown historic Los Angeles, the City of Angels, La Ciudad De Los Angeles.....right next to the Belmont tunnel of the old station, that was shut down due to less use that planned.  It turned into a party area, and a place where gangs met to discuss business, a rich gang area, and tagged totally, which is now gone, only the tunnel entrance is left and is tagged....and the tunnel of course, and the underworld, full of mystery. the smuggling and more still occurs today.  and what lies beneath is danger, full of mystery, and anger and hate, those that wish to start wwiii delv there still today just below the apartments, and have attracted something.....something very evil.  in the City of Angels, where Hades reigns supreme, California like D.C. must have his presence on occasion.  all the 7 are represented there. Demons. some demons from Prague, some from the Sahara, and some from Antarctica, and Florida, all are there too.  all below Belmont tunnel. far too dangerous for most...only the strong willed, the stealthy can survive it.  to live above it is shear insanity, or by those who are strong.< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>DO NOT LIVE HERE. There are many better options for the same price with better amenities in the area (Medici, Orsini, etc literally any of the newer buildings). Besides that, elevators are ALWAYS broken. Air conditioning frequently breaks and (this being the 3rd time this year) it takes on average 1 week to fix. Yea, DTLA in the middle of summer with no A/C is really fun. Walls are super thin. Several incidents have taken place at the dog park because management keeps letting in large dogs and breeds they claim to be banned from the building. Oh AND skid row is getting pushed out of downtown and apparently onto 2nd Street making it look like a homeless encampment. I used to be able to walk to downtown but would not even dare with the state the area surrounding the building has become. I'm sure the low income housing being built adjacent to the property will only help matters. AGAIN, MANY BETTER OPTIONS FOR THE SAME IF NOT CHEAPER AVAILABLE IN THE AREA.<//review>< pictures>

<Resp>{'time': 1502428606390, 'text': "Greetings Mickenzie. We apologize for any negative experience you've had here and hope there is still time to improve things for you. Indeed, we have experienced intermittent difficulties with one of our elevators and we've implemented replacement parts. We are hoping to be near the conclusion of the repair process. With regard to unauthorized pets, we address each situation individually as we're made aware. Of note, service animals aren't bound to the breed/weight restrictions. We are also aware that the homeless population downtown sometimes works it's way to Belmont. While we cannot control the surrounding area, we encourage residents to let us know about any unauthorized visitors on the community grounds. We hope this helps and we'd welcome the opportunity to speak with you in person and discuss your concerns in greater detail. Thank you -- Haley H., Belmont Station."}</Resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Got a new car last year and this was my second oil change (first one was at the dealership free).  I went to the dealership, they gave me my diagnostics and price (told them I'd be back).  I went to this Jiffy Lube because I had been to it a year or so back and had a good experience (figured I would give them another shot).  I went in and Javi helped me (wearing a mask and kept his distance - which I appreciate) considering the pandemic.  He walked me through my cars diagnostics and what it was due for.  He was thorough and honest about what was needed and what wasn't.  They were quick about the service, fairly priced, and super friendly.  I'd come back.< /review>

Came in for a check up before leaving town (yes I know there’s a pandemic) and I was greeted by Javier and his staff. Professional service. I just wanted an oil change and also asked if there were any necessary services recommended at the time. I wanted to see how honest they really were because a lot if us know those “mechanic tactics”. But he really went ahead and explained to me what services were recommended at the current mileage I was at. I knew what was already recommended at that mileage because I went to the dealership for the last service. So I went ahead and did the 2 services recommended by Javier. His honesty truly did win me as a customer. Good job!<//Review>

Finally I was able to do a quick oil change, and even though I could not go to my regular mechanic.  I came here to get it done fast, and service provided was excellent. Javier and staff made everything smooth and easy.  Not only were they fast, but efficient as well. They have many discounts that if you do not google them, you may miss your chance. The staff there are super cool people and they value their customers. I will definitely be back!</text>

Service was impeccable. I was so impressed with this oil change location and the people who worked there. The employees when working on my car would call out to each other to ensure communication was clear between the two and explained to me the whole oil change process. They were honest and told me my air filter could go a few more months. The prices are fair. Even without a coupon I would go back, I was out in 20 minutes. Quick, easy, and great service.<//review>

Very great staff. I wanted to make sure I got an oil change before my long drive. They fixed a light that was out and my car sounded so smooth after the oil change on my 300 mile drive. This is the place to go to. Each one that I have been to had shown great quality and super great customer service.<//review>

I’ve now been here a couple of times and I am really impressed With how well this place runs. Everyone in the shop always displays a great positive attitude about their work. They’re safety conscious and communicative. Love seeing the teamwork. I wish more local businesses ran this way. Not having to sit in a dingy waiting room is the best part. Lobby looked and smelled clean. Super fast and they always seem to have plenty of staff in the shop. Really well managed. Great job guys.< /review>

Went for an oil change recently and two gentleman serviced my vehicle. Both were very polite and friendly! They kept a conversation with me which was pleasing, didn’t make it feel like a quick “business turn”. They made sure all my lights and caps were secure and working properly, even recommended a few services for my vehicle. I feel absolutely confident that these two men had my vehicle’s best interest in mind.  I felt very well taken care of!<//text>

Stopped at this jiffylube to get an oil change on my lunch break. I pulled up and was immediately greeted with a huge smile. Everyone was super friendly. I was made aware of everything they were doing and what was recommended. They were not pushy about up selling me. The oil was changed, all checks were done, and I was on my way in less than 20 minutes!<//text>

<text>This place is going to be my go to place for oil changes. I arrived before 10am and left 20 minutes later, they checked most of my internal components, tires pressure, wiper fluids and even my brakes! Very friendly staff with greetings and how they assist you to every question. Two thumbs up!</text>< pics>

This person who knows not much about cars is so grateful for this jiffylube. I just had my oil changed in no time. Everyone was incredibly kind, helpful and transparent about what was needed for my struggling car. I was so impressed by all the guys who work there. Thank you!< /text>

Clean shop and everyone kept their distance. Their team is the best!  If you are getting your oil changed asked for Xavi. Fast service, great experience and very knowledgeable.</Review>

I love coming to this location! Jiffylube always makes my oil changes quick, easy, and I trust these guys with all my cars. Got both my air filters changed because they were way overdue. The whole process took no more than 20 minutes.  The guys there were so professional and knowledgeable. That’s why this location is my go to. Thanks jiffylube< /text>

I was helped by Javier. He was very nice and I had a great experience. He welcomed me when I pulled up and invited me inside to sit in the AC while I waited. He explained the service and how long the wait was. He is the one who also rang me up. He explained what other services my husband's car needed and made it very easy for me to understand. Very professional and nice staff. Thank You 😊<//review>

I’ve been going to this location for my usual oil changes on my Honda. I’ve been having different gage lights suddenly turn on. Javier was there to assist me and explain what was going on. Turns out it was just a faulty sensor. If I would’ve gone somewhere else I know they would’ve diagnosed something I’d have to spend more money on.
The faculty was clean overall. COVID-19 protocols were followed and practiced. I definitely recommend check this Juffy Lube out, such a friendly and honest environment.</review>

<date>1591495437454<//date><rating>1<//rating><Review>On Monday morning I noticed that I needed an oil change so I came to jiffy lube because I thought I would expect great customer service. Unfortunately not only was I over charged $652 dollars but my car stop working in the middle of the freeway. Now mind you that my car was perfectly fine. So I had to tow my car to my house (another 100) and when coming back to jiffy lube to see what could have gone wrong no one could really answer me. Now my car now will not start and was over heating after coming to jiffy Lube . After talking to the manager "Justin" he of course denied my refund and sent over one of his mechanics with No tools (which took over an hour an half) of course to just say it was not their fault. Do not come here trust me!!!! You will regret it! Told Me To Get a REAL Mechanic to Fix it; But They Are NOT PAYING FOR MY BILL OR MY REFUND.  They don't care if they ruined Your Car Under Their Care. Please Don't EVER COME HERE. Worse Costumers Service Ever.< /Review>< pics>

It can be pretty hit or miss with Jiffy lube. The Azusa location however has been doing quality work for me for a few years now. It is a quality location with knowledgeable and kind staff.</text>

The best experience getting an oil change.  Was definitely in and out and my windows were washed, inside was vacuumed,  fluids checked and wipes checked. Couldn't have asked for a better experience.</Text>

<text>I don’t ever feel comfortable leaving keys in a car and walking away while your service people retreat to their oil change dungeon down below so I wait with the car until the mechanic is ready. There is a lot of foot traffic in this parking lot/car waiting area. Today, two other cars were brought in front of ours because the welcome guy didn’t “think” we were ready to be serviced. Ugh, how about just ask if we are ready Mr. Welcome Guy!?! Your process is NOT my process. Perhaps we should be happy, he did bypass our car with a smile, offered an apology after this being brought to his attention twice; oh, and charged $89.xx for the oil change! No Vaseline...

<Review>I'd give this location 0 stars if possible. The worst customer service I've ever had. The first time I called, someone picked up the phone and just said..."ya?" Then I asked if it was jiffy lube because I was confused by the extreme lack of professionalism. He again just said..."ya." Then I asked how much a conventional oil change was, and the guy said something in Spanish and just hung up the phone. So I called back and the genius picked up the phone and apparently either tried to hang it up or put me on hold immediately, but ended up putting me on speaker phone. So I listened to him and his coworker talking about going to uti and trying to get a better job at a dealership, all while using several profanities. These seemed very set on not having to deal with the phone or actually having to do any work. Great employees you have here Jiffy Lube. Never wasting my money at your business again.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

The oil change was fine, but my tires were under-inflated, causing tire pressure warnings. Also they try to upsell you on stuff you don't really need.< /text>

<review>They always over charge when they can. Be careful of them always trying to upsell you unnecessary things. Every time I go they recommend my air filter to be changed. They refused to honor my school discount. Demanding a printed coupon but there is no coupon just print. I had my college id but they didn't care and charged double of what I was planning to spend.< /review></record>

I have a 2015 Chevy Malibu. I took it into get the oil changed three months ago. Oil filter leaked after they changed it. I took it back to the shop the tech said it's just spillage and would stop. I took it back again they retightened to oil filter it's still leaked. I ha to take it back to a third time to get the oil filter changed that time it stopped. Then just now I took it in to change the oil again after the normal cycle.  I got in the car after the service and found that it had not been vacuumed. Obviously customer service is not high on their agenda. I am going to find another Jiffy Lube to take my car to.< /text>

< Review>
One week ago I went to get my mini cooper serviced. They did not have the oil filter for my car. This was not a problem, but this particular store wanted to charge $14 more on top of $89 they were going to chargefor a oil change.  I told the clerk that I had been coming to there store for years. I left and went to another Jiffy Lube in San Dimas and they did not charge me extra for the service. The store also had to order the filter with not even a blink of an eye.  I will never go back to the Azusa Jiffy Lube Store again.</Review>

***update* so I'm reading my reciept and says they vacuumed the carpet in truck NO, says they cleaned the windows. NO,  Checked engine oil light on when arrival reciept says NO , well how do you think I knew oil needed changed cause dash light was on!!! What a disappointing experience and lies on the reciept maybe train your employees to do there job better and not lie on the reciept and  lie to your customers and not do what your saying you doing 😠

***GO SOMEWHERE ELSE*** .......Just like other review quoted 39$ on phone and I gave them exact model of vehicle, after they already drained the oil before asking me what oil I wanted they said I have to put synthetic blend or higher in motor and they would not put conventional oil in for me so 77$ later I will never go back to any jiffy lube again nor will any family or friends they should educate their employees better when thier giving price quotes cause that's twice the amount I was quoted on the phone lucky I had 5$ coupon if the oil wasn't drained already before guy came and asked me what I wanted to do I would of left immediately typical bait n switch price quotes. VERY DISAPPOINTED! !!!!! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE< /text>

We have shopped at Moe's several times. They have unique pieces and it is wonderful not having to travel to LA or SF for similar levels design decor. I have things shipped and also have came in and picked it up. Every time we go there we find a new item temping us to buy it. My wife & I recommend Moe's.</review>

Visiting Moe's today was the best furniture shopping experience I have ever had! Piper took the time to understand the design and function I am looking for! She didn't miss anything, even drew up a sketch of the room. I am confident that Piper could envision the look I wanted. There is also a great selection of unique pieces in the store.<//Review>

Moe’s is a great place to look for furniture if you’re looking for something out of the ordinary, stylish, or eye catching. Their salespeople are helpful but casual and I never felt pressured into a sale. It can take a few weeks to get your order, but it’s totally worth it for the unique pieces they offer. Definitely worth a look!< /Review>

Young man is definitely an asset to store.  Why only 4 stars because I had to pay the sticker price on the couch. Anthony didn’t have the power to even offer me a 5% discount or free delivery. Had I not wanted the couch I would have definitely walked out. Everyone know furniture has a large mark up so a discount should not be out of the question. Poor management policy.< /review>< rating>

<review>I had been looking locally and online for over a month and Natalie helped me find exactly what I want and finally make a decision. I am very pleased with the customer service offered and the offerings at Moes. If you like a more modern look they are definitely worth visiting. Happy furniture hunting to all!!!<//review><date>1524090549456</date>< Gmap_id>

{'time': 1523716686024, 'text': "Thanks for your recent purchase, Gary!  We are glad you had a great shopping experience in our new Moe's Home store.  We are sorry we do not have all items in stock.  We currently have 80% of all items in our showroom either in stock in our warehouse or on order.  Unfortunately, due to the extreme popularity of some of the Moe's Home product, the manufacturer underestimated the rate of sale and is out of stock in both their American and Canadian warehouses.  Although we are the first Moe's Home store in California, Moe's stores are opening in many areas of the country.  The manufacturer is ramping up production to meet the growing demand for this outstanding line of furniture and accessories.  Sorry for the temporary delay, but we know it will be worth the wait!!"}< /response>

<text>I just wanted to take a moment to truly appreciate how wonderful, kind, caring, and generous Maria is in Castle Wood Cottages. She is such a fabulous employee and truly a gem in this company.

Truly a pleasure meeting her and I can highly recommend Castle Wood Cottages to anyone who enjoys quality service! Maria you are amazing! Also, a message to the owners, thank you for putting your guests first, thank you for being caring and compassionate I appreciate it!<//text>< Name>

<review>No AC room got very hot and the vibe outside was kind of creepy so we didn't want to open front door. There were wasp in our bathroom. Also in the AM the front window has no real coverage so it's very bright at 5am. Grounds were not kept up. Tub was probably the only cool thing about the room. Definitely not worth $200 + tax an night.</review></record></dataset><record>

Although the Treehouse is a great theme, it did not meet expectations.  Upon arrival, room was "picked up" but not clean.  There was a Condom wrapper on living room floor!  The small amount of carpet in the room is horribly stained.  Then we discovered a small picture in a weird place high on the wall outside of the bathroom.  I lifted off the picture to find it was covering a smoke detector! Other things to be aware of - The front door only has a key lock, no deadbolt and no door chain.  Based on them concealing a broken smoke detector and lack of door security, it appears this establishment does not care about the safety of their guests.  Also, bring your own hangers if you want to hang your clothes, none are provided. Last issue, they tell you no guests are allowed. However, last night there were no parking spaces available for me to park on the property.  The office staff leaves the property around 6 p.m. and it becomes open parking as no one is around to enforce their no guests policy.  After approximately 5 minutes, we noticed 4 individuals leave on the the cottages and get into separate cars and leave.  This opened up a space for me to be able to park on the property. Overall, the stay in the treehouse cottage was just OK.  Guess I thought the room would be cleaner due to the high cost of the non-refundable cleaning deposit.  All comments made are just my opinion based on a two night stay.< /text>
< resp>
{'time': 1562712766545, 'text': 'SD, the dirty room you described does not live up to our expectations, and we deeply regret to see the way you found your room. Maria is particularly confused by this as when she did cabin check prior to your arrival, she moved "fur" carpet to adjust it and was literally working in precisely that spot. This will be reviewed with all of our staff, and we sincerely apologize for this incident. In regards to the parking, we don\'t allow guests and we were absolutely full over the weekend...when we are full, there are precisely enough spots for the guests.  I personally live on site and perhaps the people you refer to were my guests?   So although the office isn\'t staffed 24 hours, the property itself is watched all the time.  Yes, the old hard wired smoke detector was already removed covered with a small picture when we purchased the hotel...newer detectors are installed and present, perhaps you missed those.  Your $100.00 deposit isn\'t a non refundable cleaning deposit, upon review of your paperwork you will see that the deposit was taken off your balance upon check in.  Additionally, I\'m sorry the coat hangers weren\'t replaced after the last guests, unfortunately they are repeatedly taken as momentos!  Over all, I\'m sorry you didn\'t adore our treehouse, as your wife stated everything was "amazing" shortly after your early check in, we didn\'t expect that you\'d be so unhappy!  We appreciate this feedback. If you\'d like to speak directly to someone about your stay, then please don\'t hesitate to give us a call. Thank you. -The Castle Wood Court'}< /resp>

Really cute decor.  Easy to find yet you feel secluded and in a whole different world, especially when lit up at night.  Keep in mind the square footage.of the room when you book.  There was plenty of room for 2, but it is not huge.  The jacuzzi tub was very relaxing after a long weekend.</Text>

Fun, creative and romantic! Staff are very friendly. The entire place is so cute. Has a courtyard with a swing, chairs and a ping ping table. Our lodge was the 3 story Treehouse one. Amazing! Lodge has a big jacuzzi, large shower, fireplace, spiral staircase up to the bedroom and even has plush robes. Everything u need for a romantic evening!</review>

The place is outstanding. I helped the original owner build these cabins and now the new owner is doing a great job of maintaining and upgrading. Really nice people and the attention to detail in the cabins is really something. Much nicer than any other themed places I've seen or stayed at and the location is perfect for Big Bear recreation.<//text>

My husband and I stayed in the Castle Garden and it was perfect! Words can NOT describe how beautiful the entire property is. It was clean, comfortable and like living in a fairy tale. There is just so much detail all over. The staff was kind and accommodating. We will be back and I strongly reccomend staying here!< /text>

How to chance to stay there with my girlfriend all the Cottages are themed which is awesome they're very clean and they smell amazing when you get inside they have a hot tub which is awesome bring your own bath salts they do give you some as a sample but the water is very hard up there heads up there's parking by each cabin and plenty of restaurants and bars nearby to hop around. The front desk is extremely cool. Very very quiet private but at the same time it's like to do what you want atmosphere as long as you don't make too much noise on the outside definitely will be back</text>

<Review>I stayed in the Castle Garden room for 3 days and 2 nights. It was stunning and worth every penny. There are so many details to look at. Everything medieval was amazing. The only faults were the modern parts of the room. The remote to the TV did not work but we worked our way around it. The TV also could only play DVDs. Really not the end of the world as they have a great selection of DVDs in the front. The waterfall was beautiful but it leaked water all into the kitchen so quickly that we couldn't keep it on for more than 15 mins. The pillows were very uncomfortable. For the second night we actually went out and bought pillows and slept much better. We also ran out of toilet paper late at night because we were only given one roll so we had to go buy some toilet paper as well. The rest of the night was magical. We had no issues with the rest of the hotel. It was very clean, the two person bath is really sized for two people, the jets worked perfect. Every bit of the room was detailed and nothing appeared cheap. I would love to stay again.</Review><UserId.>115829419511991446363<//UserId.><rating>4< /rating></record>

We've reached out to talk as this isn't the impression we got when you extended your stay.  As far as the construction noise, we apologize that was going on -- and we will look into that as our crew doing the remodel next door doesn't work weekends. We understand how the noise would've been a bother, which is why they don't work weekends.\nWe did add the late check out fee when you requested it, that was the additional charge.  We'd really like to discuss that you feel overcharged, as we applied a discount for your added night and aren't sure where you were overcharged?  As far as your room, we don't typically receive this feedback, but we'll make sure to address it and see what needs to be done.

Even though they told me no construction they ran saws and banging in the car stall next to my cabin for my whole stay. Even leaning wood against my  bedroom and more loud banging noises. Like they thought they could make a wall just by hitting wood with the hammers like in a cartoon.  I asked if it would continue and they said no. It continued.
The place could seriously use a dusting. Everything in the cabin is incredibly cheaply made. The hanging robes were not clean and the towels were more than damp upon arrival.
This is also the most expensive place in town for what you get and size of place. They overcharged me for the room as well and instead of offering money back they wound up charging me an extra $30. I left and stayed for 1/3 of the price on the lake with great views and clean rooms.< /Review>

My wife and I were in town for the Spartan Race in Big Bear and we are going to definitely come back and were recommending to everyone.

<text>We stayed in the castle. We were super impressed with the amount of work and detail that went into it. There isn't a single detail missing. It is not cheesy by any means. The craftsmanship and materials used doesn't get any better. You are essentially in a three story castle. I guarantee you will agree with our assessment. If not, please use the following procedure: using index and middle fingers together, press against wrist. If feel pulse, you are alive and aren't thinking clearly. Please reevaluate. If nothing is felt, you might want to get that checked...< /text>< Pictures>

It's a great little place we go up to eat at 1 of 3 restaurants peppercorns and a few others and sometimes we have a drink or 2 and will not drive home these little cottages are quaint perfect for a couple for a little fun a hot tub with decent robes and themed rooms. They give you one free log to burn there's always a cat that hangs around very friendly the tree house is awesome it's to story there is free Wi-Fi and even DVD's to rant just a cool little place that's different for you and the Mrs.< /Review>

We have a reservation here in July and stopped by to check it out before hand. The man working the front desk was out walking his dog or something around the grounds so there was a bit of a wait before we were able to speak to anyone at the front desk. When he came back we asked to look around. The room we had reserved had guests currently so we couldn't see that, but we walked around the grounds and the entire area was very cute and whimsically decorated. Looked like the front arch way was undergoing some landscaping, but over all it was very nice. We're looking forward to staying here!<//text>

Quaint , romantic place with snow (during winter) a table for two and large jacuzzi tubs. Bath robes , and themed units. Also a two story treehouse. A must stay for a romantic getaway . I reccomend Evergreens 2 blocks away to eat or The Pines on the lakefront.< /review>

Very cool concept. We stayed in the castle. It was nice. The front staff wasn't exactly accommodating and wasn't extremely friendly but wasn't over the top rude. The rooms do need some fresh paint and dusting and the flowers need to be replaced and fluffed up. Overall it was fairly clean...not completely clean but it didn't make my skin crawl.< /Text>

The rooms were fairly priced and it was nice to have a nice quiet time to ourselves away from daily life. Would go back here again to try the other themes.< /Review>

The inside and out need detail cleaning, Trees inside and leaves are very dusty, some webs, half of the lights on the trees inside did not light. WiFi was too weak to connect our devices to. Also Needed new fitted Curtains, The Jacuzzi was dirty,  Trash in Dumpster in front of Cottages is overflowing , Also the yard is not well maitained, We were thinking of coming back to experience the other Cottages but its really not worth the money. It was the worst $500.00 plus dollors ever spent for 2 nights. We truly would not reccomend this place to anyone.  Seriously<//Review></record></dataset><record>

My mother Mary Crosby has been using this mechanic for several years now. She is elderly and they are always fair and courteous. They keep track of her vehicle needs and make thoughtful and never try to gouge or make unnecessary repairs. We appreciate them very much and highly recommend them.</review>

My 2012 Chevy Camaro has needed a few repairs and R&S is certainly trust worthy. They specialize in performance cars (although I'm sure they can handle anything). Their prices on performance cars are competitive to the rest of the industry (they aren't a discount automotive shop). However from what I've learned, that when it comes to a performance car, you get what you pay for. And these guys are straight shooters in respect to price and needed work. They won't try to upsell or oversell you something you don't need. They are also very quick and stand behind all the work they've done for me over the years.< /review>

<Name>Tony Ker<//Name><date>1612464545137</date><rate>5< /rate><text>I have been going to R&S ever since I was able to drive. My family has been using them for years. When I moved out of the area for 8 years I needed to find a new auto shop to get my car serviced and for any of my needs. I was greatly disappointed at the lack of integrity that other shops had. I was shocked because I hadn't known any different having only used R&S for the majority of my life. This led me to drive back to the valley just to have my car serviced anytime something came up. I knew I could trust them to be truthful with me and only recommend the work that actually needed to be done and do so at a fair price. I would recommend them to anyone.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Eddie has been taking care of me and my families vehicles for over 30 years and I’ve never had an issue. Quality repair by people who care is his motto and it shows in everything R & S Auto does! His advisors and staff are always honest, respectful and professional! Thank you Kevin, Mario and most of all Eddie!!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Super friendly, super fast, and super trustworthy. Kevin at the front counter is THE MAN! Talk about above and beyond, this gentleman established a new relationship with my fleet company in front of me, allowing them to service my company truck instead of relying on the poor service of other local chain shops. All of my vehicles are now serviced by the amazing team at R&S!< /Text>< pictures>

FIVE stars in my opinion for over eleven years now. Eddie and his crews do an excellent job of diagnosing, repairing and maintaining my vehicles and take great care of me as their customer. Prices are always fair and the parts and work always good. LOWEST priced shop? Maybe not. However, it's easily the best VALUE, hands down. Far superior to any dealer-garage experience I've ever had in the SCV.
Highly recommended</review>

Our daughter goes to school nearby and her car is old and needed to be looked over from top to bottom to ensure safety and that everything was working fine.  Eddie worked with us and made sure we got everything done that was needed and pointed out what can be deferred for another time.  Friendly and efficient service.</review>

< review>
Miracle workers!  I've been coming here for years; the fact that I have two older vehicles, one high mileage, makes no difference--the vehicles are always kept at factory standards!  Recently we collaborated on an upgrade project for the 2000 6.5 diesel that required exquisite attention to detail--the shop went way above & beyond that resulted in an excellent outcome--I feel confident in driving anywhere, & the first trip up the 395 at 8000 feet confirmed that--she roared over the summit effortlessly!  6.5's are notorious for being unreliable, finicky, and in general very difficult to maintain & operate--not this one!  We may be moving back east & I feel confident that we'll pass state inspection  (been there, done that--Maryland basically tears the car down as an example)  with no drama.  Great shop, great rates, great service.  Thanks R & S!<//review>

This mechanic is overpriced. They promised to get work done in one day but at the last minute delayed the pick up until the next day. They didn't want to take responsibility for their technician crew up. Their customer service is disappointing.<//Review>

<Text>I have had nothing but good experiences at R & S Automotive.  Both Mario and Dylan, who I have dealt with in the past, are professional, helpful, listen, and great to work with.  I recently brought my daughters car in for service as she is no longer covered by Toyota and they did a great job, which is totally what I expected it to be.  I rely on their honesty and doing perfect car service.  Like I said, my experiences have been totally fine and I would recommend them to anyone.< /Text>< Pictures>

Price was average for regular maintenance but way higher to replace my tie rod ends and to get realigned, always get more than one quote. Satisfied with service and seem to be very knowledgeable. They also got me in and out a lot quicker than expected. Steve took time out of a busy schedule to go on a test drive with me and Jerry was a pleasure to deal with. I’ve only been there once but will be going there again. Steve also gave me a great tip to get better mpg with my diesel.< /Review>

Mario, Dylan and the rest of the group are always polite and courteous.  They give great service.  I have never had any problems with their mechanics.  I especially enjoy the shuttle service when anything major needs to be done.  I was referred to them by a very reliable source; so I knew even before I started using them.<//Text>

< Review>
R&S Automotive have been our mechanics for the last few years. We find them professional and attentive and quite reasonably priced. They never push us to carry out any unnecessary repairs and always provide a fairly accurate estimate of costs before making the repairs. The staff is very professional and polite. They used to be open on Saturdays occasionally, which was very convenient for our family, since we have small children. Hopefully they'll decide to open on Saturdays again soon!<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>R&S was recommended to me 4 years ago by a trusted friend.  As a widow who knows nothing about the workings of an automobile and doesn't care to learn, I took my friend's advice.  So glad I did.  Mario and the guys have taken excellent care of my car and motorhome.  I had a problem with a tire once and they advised me to go to a tire store.  I did and the tire store not only fixed the tire (free) they told me I needed an $800 brake job,(not so free) which they would be happy to do right then and there.  I took my car back to R&S and asked them to check the brakes.  They found nothing wrong with them and did not charge me. That was two years ago.  The brakes are still fine.   I'm a regular customer who knows R&S to be honest, professional, trustworthy and excellent at their job. I highly recommend them.<//review>< Pictures>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Well, I have been taking my vehicles to R&S for a long time.  You don't go here to save money but due to the fact this a family business I believed in the quality of work they should do.  It always seemed that every time I took a car here there was always another problem with the car within a few days.  I always chalked it up to the fact the car was getting older.  This particular incident is different.  My wife called ahead to ask for the wait time if she came in for an oil change and tire rotation.  They told her she would be out in under 45 minutes.  My poor wife waited over two hours and 45 minutes before the car was ready.  They also told her there was a nail in the tire that was in the sidewall, meaning we needed a new tire.  They ordered the tire and had her come back then next day.  Once she left they charged her $236 for one tire, which took them over an hour to put on.  The problem is that when she got home the nail was still in the tire.  She called R&S who stated she must have picked up another nail (in the same place as the last nail).  I drove down to R&S where they showed me a hole, not a nail, that was not in the side of the tire.  They told me my wife was lying about the time she waited for the oil change and told me there was nothing they would do for me.  I had to go to a different tire store who patched the tire for free.  I truly believe they took advantage of my wife due to her being a woman and overcharged us for the tire, had her wait an unacceptable time for the oil change and would not accept the fact they changed the wrong tire in the first place (even though it should have just been patched).  I will never return to R&S for any type of service.< /Review>< Pics>

<response>{'time': 1549302030421, 'text': 'We apologize that your recent visit did not meet your standards. The oil change service would have taken the estimated time of 45 minutes, but the customer showed about an hour after calling in. The total time of service was 2 hours (reviewed on the security cameras), which included additional services aside from the oil change. The tire had a nail puncture outside of the legal repair zone, and was very close to the sidewall; we are looking out for your safety, and would not want to be held liable if the patch failed. The tire that was replaced, was also rotated to the front (being a FWD vehicle) which explains the misunderstanding of us "replacing the wrong tire". We have called both of the customers to further discuss, but were told we "have the wrong number" by the recipient, and disconnected shortly after.'}< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c2868c59a43c97:0x88d597770e6ddd15<//Gmap_id></record>

I've been going to R&S for nearly 25 years and you can always count on them to be honest about what your car needs done and then fixing whatever the problem is correctly the first time. I've never had to bring a car back because they didn't do the job right the first time. They do great work and are completely reliable.< /review>

R&S has been my go to shop since I owned a car.  They are very knowledgeable and only give recommendations for stuff that actually needs to be done.  They won't try to tack on a bunch of unnecessary repairs.  They are honest and trustworthy.  I'm pretty mechanically inclined but anything that I can't (or don't want to) take care of myself, I take to them and they get it done fast and at a great price!

I would recommend them to anyone!</review>

R&S Automotive did everything that they said they would in the time that they said they would and even took care of a problem that another repair shop had tried and failed at twice. And all at a very reasonable price. By far the most professional and respectable repair shop that I have ever dealt with.</review>

Usually in and out in a day. There are less expensive auto shops but the price is worth the quality work and reliability.
Mario is awesome! Eddie is always open to hear about our experience good or bad. Rarely is there ever a bad experience.
Best place in SCV to have work done. My whole family takes their vehicles to R&S!<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c2868c59a43c97:0x88d597770e6ddd15</Gmap_id>< time>

<Review>Don't go here if you expect to save money compared to a dealer.  These guys were 25% higher on a repair than what the dealer wanted to charge. Outrageous. I asked if they wanted to take another look at their price but they stayed firm.  I guess 7 years worth of service, repairs and patronage doesn't account for much to them.  Or maybe I just dealt with the wrong guy.  Oh well R&S just lost a long time customer.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1544986578636, 'text': "As explained, our technician had 2 additional hours of labor on your vehicle that you weren't charged for, and comparing prices over the phone, without tax and diagnosis will always be cheaper."}<//Response>< GmapID>

This established group, is just that, Established, An honest group,they come with an array of vehicle experience, Quality Customer Service, and well thought out estimates, that can be within your budget.

Personally, I've brought to them my 2008 FORD F-150, 2008 LEXUS RX300, 2012 TOYOTA PRIUS 4, 2004 AND 2012 FOR EXPEDITION'S.

Give these guys a try, ask for Mario!< /text>

R&S Automotive is everything a repair shop should be. The shop is very clean as are the technicians, no grease monkeys here. The staff is knowledgeable and provides easy to understand explanations of the work needing to be done. I found the cost of service and repairs to be very reasonable. You can be confident that you will not be ripped-off at R&S Automotive. R&S Automotive also has a great waiting room with free coffee and Wi-Fi plus a wide variety of magazines to help pass the time. If you cannot wait for your vehicle to be serviced R&S Automotive also has a courtesy van to take you to your home or office and they will pick you up when your vehicle is finished; and Gene, the van's driver, will entertain you with witty conversation.</review>

<text>This place is terrible. I'm a journeyman lineman and if I know anything it's that you have to be good at your job to get a good reputation and make money. That's not the case here. I took my truck in to have a valve cover replaced and both inner tie rods changed. I get the truck back and the dash is lit up like a Christmas tree and the oil pressure gauge doesn't work. And the alignment is all loose after a day of driving on the interstate.<//text>< pics>

You failed to mention that we took care of your oil pressure gauge situation, as it was only a loose connection - but we do apologize, again. Also, your vehicle is highly modified with a lift, bigger tires, and multiple electronics; we doubt your truck ever rode 'tight' on the interstate. We hope you find another automotive repair shop that can meet your needs."}<//Resp>

<review>My experience over the years with mechanics has often been disappointing. Often what I am told by the service writer does not quite make sense. I guess you could say that I have become hard to please.
This was my first visit to R&S. When I initially described the problem with the vehicle, Mario, the service writer, understood what I was saying. During the repairs, Mario kept me informed about the repair process. You could tell that he had first hand knowledge of the work being performed. The problem was correctly diagnosed. Unnecessary repairs were avoided. Price was fair. R&S has a new satisfied customer!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

This is my 3rd or 4th time taking our 2010 Nissan Altima to R&S, and like each time before, the experience was great. I had a smog check, oil change, and rear brake pads and rotors changed. I like that they provide you with an itemized estimate of the charges prior to your servicing, and then call you with updates or changes. My whole family goes to R&S and I would definitely recommend them to a friend.</review>

I have been going to R&S Automotive for over 10 years. I live in Santa Clarita and would not trust my 4 vehicles to any other automotive repair shop. Usually work with Mario and he is great.< /review>

Honest, professional and thorough.     R&S has been our go to mechanic for over 10 years. And I have no reason to change.

Their quality is top notch  and they standyby their work.      But the most impressive part is their integrity.

Two examples:    I had some work done to my van.   It was rather extensive and the price tag reflected it.    The following day, I get a call from Eddie, the owner.   He said that he reviewed the bill and found that some of the work was covered by their warranty   "Where would you like the refined chris eck mailed for the $500".

Second example happend just last week.   My Sedans power steering went out.     I have them check and it needs a new pump.    But instead of the $300 charge to replace it, Mario, their awesome service advisor, tells me that Chevy has a service advisory on it, and if i take it to them, they will replace it free.    Who does that?!!    They could have made $300 and I would have been none the wiser.

That's why I take all my cars and highly recommend R&S Automotive.</review>

I'm currently moving and blew a ujoint on my truck. After struggling with it for a few hours, I called eddie at r and s and they had me bring the driveshaft in. I had a new u joint in place in under 30 min. They  have great friendly service, took very good care of me am now a customer for life.< /review>

I switched to R&S on an enthusiastic recommendation from a family friend. I became suspicious of my old mechanic when he slapped me with over $700 in maintenance and repairs on a drastically over-priced used car he'd sold me. Up to that point I'd only racked up 2100 miles on it. When I brought it to R&S to fix a coolant leak, they identified the problem as a leaky hose and stuck thermostat, and didn't try to add on any suspicious or arbitrary services. They charged me $75 less than their original estimate.

They also carted me back and forth twice between Newhall and Canyon Country at no extra cost. Everyone I met was friendly and approachable and patient with my questions. As far as I am able to judge, R&S is a fair, honest, and efficient mechanic, and for me, that is everything.<//Review>

Eleven years ago I got a solar system from Solar City/Tesla.  The inverter never worked correctly and it had to be repaired or replaced 12 times in 10 years.  Since they refused to extend my expiring warranty, I searched for other companies that would give me a reliable system.  Solar Watt listened to me and worked to update my system with a reliable inverter.  The cost was reasonable and  feel that I can finally be confident about my production.  I've found them to be an honest business.</review>

We received excellent service and professionalism from everyone that was involved in the process of providing us with our solar system. The constant communication from Dave and the rest of the team made this a seamless process. We ran into a meter problem which Dave quickly resolved at no further charge to us. We were very pleased with results of the solar installation and we highly recommend Dave and his team. Ron and Mary<//Text>

Solar Watt Solutions is the real deal.  We transitioned to solar in 2012.  One of the smarter things we have done.  We interviewed several companies.  Some of which were clowns.  Dave presented our options clearly without pressure so we could make an informed decision.  As a small business owner ourselves, all we were looking for was a company that offered a quality product, at a fair price and stood behind their word.  Now 2020 I can confirm that Solar Watt Solutions does all of those.  Since our system install 8 years ago, we have referred Solar Watt Solutions to several friends that inquired about our experience and added them into their mix of quotes.  All of which ultimately went with Solar Watt Solutions and communicated how impressed and happy they were with their experience.  We also expanded our solar system to increase production to accommodate a "geo electric water heater" converting from propane hot water heater.  Another smarter thing we have done.  But the real reason for posting this review now after 8 years is that after the succession of heavy storms that we experienced this winter we experienced a leak under a panel section.  Hey it happens.  With no question Dave sent out his crew and remedied the situation promptly and professionally standing behind their warranty.  I generally do not post reviews.  If your in the market for solar you need to include Solar Watt Solutions them in your fact finding quote mix......the rest will take care of itself.< /text>

Our very good friends in Vista recommended SolarWattSolutions, they went with Dave eight years ago and the service is still awesome.  We went to them and the process was easy and quick.  We really appreciate the great service Dave and his folks provide. We live in San Diego (Mission Hills) and have 10 panels on our roof.  Thank you Dave.<//Review>

<Text>I had a CoolPV system installed in November and was impressed with the professionalism of everyone I dealt with, including the installation teams.   But, I  wanted to wait until now for my review so that I  could honestly report on the Pool Heating and Solar Energy production combined.  I am happy to say that my Pool Heating is working perfectly  and that I am producing the Solar Energy that I expected to or more.   This is a great company to do business with and I couldn't be happier.</Text></record></dataset><record>

At the end I made the decision to go with Solar Watt Solutions. The process was made very simple and provided me with all the answers to my questions and concerns. The biggest thing was their honesty about the entire system and process. I live in Murrieta and that was not a problem for them since they work in all the San Diego and riverside areas. My main concern was getting the process started before the end of the year and I am happy to say they even beat the deadline. The system was completed in November and I wanted to wait before I put my review to see if the system is functioning to the capacity that they said it would. Well, I am happy to say it is doing better than I expected. Thank you Dave Watt and Solar Watt for your beautiful work and for your honesty.</Review>< Pictures>

I just went live with my Solar Watts Solution's installed solar system (4.8 Kw). I am very happy with it.
From the begging, my sales representative Ollie was taking an excellent care of me. The company closely listened to my needs and wishes. Watts Solutions was always very willing to adjust and customize my system. Ollie worked with me through all my options in the deepest detail until I fully understood my best choice.
My install was fairly involved. From replacing my old roof, changing the old main electric panel, installing a new level 2 EV car charger to digging a trench to the street to support my new solar system, the company took an excellent care of all the aspects of the entire install. Everything went smoothly. The install was hands off for me. Watts solution handled everything end to end. I highly recommend using their services. You will not be just a customer, Watts Solutions is a true partner that will guide you and help you make the right choices during your solar journey.<//text>

< review>
Dave is by far one of the most upstanding business owners I’ve had the pleasure to do (or not do business with).  I bought a home that had solar panels already installed and noticed a leak in my house.  I called a roofer and they said it was from the solar panels and that it would be best to find a solar company that could come take a look.  Dave was referred many time on my Nextdoor app so I reached out.  He was so great!  Answered all my questions and was totally honest and said it would be best if I could really find who installed them because there is a 10 year warranty on solar panels/installation.

Thanks to him I really made an effort to find the company and that put the panels on.  They came out and checked the leak and I was a little skeptical of the backpedaling I was hearing.  I immediately called Dave for his advice.  He’s honest and trustworthy and I would recommend him to anyone and everyone who wants solar.<//review>

Outstanding service from start to finish.  We purchased a home in April that had solar system, but a broken inverter.  The inverter was under warranty but the previous installer that installed the solar system for the previous owner was no longer in business so we contacted Solar Watt Solutions to replace the inverter.  Even though this was a small job they got me up and running and provided outstanding customer service throughout the whole process.  Would highly recommend!</Review>

We got solar through Solar Watt Solutions and we are saving big on our electric bill. Dave was very thorough and made sure that we would be able to generate all of our electricity from our panels but would still have room to grow (ie add AC or an electric car) if we need more electricity. The installation was fast. They are honest and trustworthy. Highly recommend for anyone looking for solar in Carlsbad and North San Diego County.< /text>

<Text>If you are looking for a trustworthy company look no further!  They were recommended to us by some friends and we are so glad they did.  We interviewed 5 total companies and they were the clear winner.  They were very transparent, answered all of our questions and put us at ease about the whole process.  Ollie didin't try to "sell" us solar he helped us to make our home more efficient.  This was not what I experienced with  the other 4 companies we interviewed.  They all had a clear motive and it was a waste of our time. Choose Solar Watt, you won't be disappointed! Everyone from Solar Watt has been fantastic.  My husband said the installation team was fantastic, and he does not give praise easily.  This was an easy choice for us to make.  They truly are a 5 star company!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

We highly recommend Solar Watt Solutions. Every aspect of our solar system purchase and installation was flawless. Despite being in the middle of the COVID-19 Pandemic, our systems was up and running ahead of schedule. We’re the third household within our family to go with Solar Watt Solutions.< /Text>

Dave, Jim, Steve and the crew were fantastic every step of the way. The communication, pricing, and service are absolutely top notch, and I could not give a higher recommendation to Solar Watt Solutions.

Do your research and you will see that Solar Watt goes a step further. For one, they did an honest assessment of our needs and sold us an appropriately-sized system, unlike a couple of other companies we spoke to. Second, they installed a Level 2 charging station and paid to have the warranty extended, making the entire solar/charging system warrantied for 25 years. Third, they recommended a roofing company they partner with that was stellar (Adan Cruz Roofing).

Finally, the entire process, from signing the contract to SDG&E approving and turning on the system was 52 days, including an entire roof installation. And this was during the holidays!

Thank you, Solar Watt Solutions, for a great experience!< /Review>

We interviewed several companies that included referrals & others from our own research.  After meeting with Jim, it was clear that we were speaking with the most knowledgeable representative.  Other companies recommended more panels at a higher cost but Jim explained it wouldn't be necessary which in turn saved us thousands.  In addition, Solar Watt offered the panels & installation at a lesser cost than anyone else we interviewed.  Everything was coordinated seamlessly & we appreciate everything Solar Watt offered to help us with our needs.  Highly recommend this company!!!< /Text>

<Review>Home project that involve contractors are rarely smooth.  There typically seems to be a hang up with materials, weather, a crew has to be put on an emergency job, etc.  Well, working with Solar Watt, none of this was the case. The work was done on time and they were flexible with a couple of our requests and made the whole experience extremely positive and smooth.  I do not hesitate recommending them for solar.<//Review><Response>None< /Response><userid>104552990065564079208< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<review>Dave Watt and his company Solar Watt Solutions has exceeded our expectations in every regard. He was recommended by our roofing contractor for his honesty and quality of work. Our system went on line September of 2017 and has performed above expectations ever since. We are producing slightly more electricity than we use. We put off installing solar because of appearance. Their installation is neat clean and mostly out of sight. We hardly know it's there. We get a report monthly from Solar Watt Solutions. Questions I've had have been answered quickly by phone or email. I feel they will be there for me in the long run. It is now fun to get our SDG&E bill.

I was made aware of Solar Watt Solutions through multiple respected sources, most of whom were customers. Colleagues in the construction trades also had very good things to say about Solar Watt Solutions. They have their own crews install all of their systems. They are a small cadre of professionals with pride of workmanship. Their system designers have years of product and system knowledge and can claim prowess well above that of their competitors and would be “ professionals”.
They are a small company whom is pacing their growth and concertedly planning their marketing plan. They do not advertise. Their  sharp penciled personalized system prices do not include ANY additional costs built into them for advertising. Call this company after you have been assaulted and marketed into mind numbing product confusion and sticker shock. They will can and will educate you if you want and give sources to research, if you need that. They also treat you and your home with respect. Be forewarned... you’re gonna love ‘em!!</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dc721ed83c3baf:0xc85b1d6040dd36a6<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We hired Solar Watt Solutions a couple of years ago to install solar panels for our home.  They were knowledgable and helpful in choosing the right panels for our electrical demands.  We have contacted them only a few times since installation, and they were quick to respond to our questions. I would recommend Solar Watt Solutions to anyone interested in installing solar panels in their home or business.</Review>< Rating>

<Text>We have nothing but good things to say about Solar Watt solutions! Choosing a solar contractor is a very daunting task because of the sheer amount of competition and many in this industry use aggressive sales tactics, including badmouthing their competition and claiming superiority in a way that only they can measure. Meeting with Andrew for the initial consultation was very easy, he came to our house at a time that was convenient for us, gave us enough information for us to realize he understood our needs, but at the same time, he did not overextend his welcome trying to rush us into a hasty decision. The installation staff lead by Octavio were absolutely amazing! Very polite, did an outstanding job, worked hard, worked fast and made sure we knew what was installed on the roof and in the garage. We own a 2-story house in Carlsbad and these people are expert ladder climbers! They are able to carry a solar panel on their shoulder faster than we can climb up our staircase. Some of their local competitors have a mandatory crane installation that cost over $2,000 per day alone, but these people know what they are doing. Our system was installed very fast, and activated within days after an easy inspection with the city and verification from SDGE. Our system is already producing more energy than expected, and it comes with app monitoring via the SolarEdge app that gives real time and historical data. We are very happy we were diligent in finding the right company to install our solar panels and highly recommend Solar Watt Solutions!<//Text>< pictures>

Would recommend to anyone! I wish I had got my solar installed with them first. I had a lot of issues with first company that installed my solar and was not happy with their service and Solar Watt Solutions helped me resolve all the issues and now I'm a happy camper! Thanks to them I'm now able to save on my solar and get the service that was promised.<//text>

<user>108749297498517854104< /user><review>We recently decided to check into solar and after meeting Jim with Solar Watt solutions we were extremely impressed. We actually vetted 2 other companies and by far Solar Watt Solutions system, warranty  and technology was superior. We use the CoolPV Solar Panels - which uses thermal heat from the panels to heat our pool.
We have been very pleased with every aspect of our installation process -- They were very upfront and professional. Dave has also been great to work with . Everything went exactly as they promised.
We have had our system for a short time, but are extremely happy.< /review>< Pics>

Solar Watt Solutions was an absolute joy to work with all the way around and they deserve the highest rating available. Even now that the system is installed and operating, I’m still in a bit amazed at  how seamless the whole process went with absolutely none of the “common” contractor delay/horror stories.
We live in Valley Center and had quoted 5 different companies for the 18 panel job. The Solar Watt Sales team was very responsive, professional and the quote was received the same day!  Even after discussing a few variations including number of panels, different manufacturers and controllers, each time the updated quote was received very quickly.  This happened with no one else, and in fact I needed to call two other companies to ask when I could expect the quote.  Pricing was very good and they never asked for an upfront fee. Only after the system was turned on and accepted by SDG&E, was payment requested.  Further, they were able to improve upon the original installation date and when it came time to install, they actually upgraded portions of the system at no additional charge. Now that it’s operating, it’s also very fascinating to watch the output on my computer.
The installation team was friendly, polite and professional.  Nice guys with friendly attitudes that didn’t mind me asking lots of questions.  Originally planned for two days, they finished in about a day and a half and totally cleaned up the site when they finished.
There are certainly many solar companies to choose from, but in my opinion, what sets these guys apart from others is their no pressure, extremely responsive, and flawless execution mentality.  There is nothing more I could have wanted from a Solar company, so to say I am very pleased and would highly recommend them is an understatement.</review>

Solar Watt Solutions installed solar on our house the end of October..
After getting 5 quotes I selected them and i am very happy I did.
The work they did was perfect and they were very professional through out the entire process. I highly recommend them.

We obtained three quotes from leading players.  We were most comfortable with Andrew Watt's attention to detail and informative approach.  No high-pressure sales gimmick and no BS either.  Solar Watt was very competitive and their execution was professional.  They are there for you post sale as well available for questions and help.  Solar is a no-brainer for us and we are enjoying not worrying about high electric bills and looking at a payback within 5 year years.< /Review>

We have installed solar panels into two of our houses and have used Solar Watt in both cases. We're very pleased with Dave, the owner, who takes his time explaining the available options, benefits and drawbacks, and has accommodated all our needs and requests. He offers the latest solar technology and does not charge a premium for that. His prices were quite competitive, especially with the big companies out there. We were quite happy with the work of his team, timing of installations and overall outcome. We have recommended him to our friends and neighbors.</Review>

I did a lot of research before speaking with any solar suppliers, as the subject was new  to me. Then I contacted four suppliers, two large and two small, and requested a plan and bid to install solar in our 5,750 sq ft home in Rancho Santa Fe. Dave Watt, owner and operator of Solar Watt was included, as he had been recommended to me by my roofer who I have done business with for thirteen years. After speaking in detail with each of the four suppliers, Solar Watt was an easy choice.

Dave asked for the information from my electric bill which he needed to develop a plan and then came to the house and showed me four alternatives, clearly explaining each in a very accurate manner. (The two big suppliers told me things I knew to be incorrect and tried to sell me a larger system then I needed.They were also more expensive. The other small supplier offered a slightly lower cost but could not answer several of my questions about the system they were proposing).

The installation by Solar Watt was flawless with everyone and everything on schedule. The people working on the job were full time employees, not subcontractors, and were well trained and knew exactly what they were doing. Dave handled all of the paperwork including the permits and tie in to the electric company.

The final benefit is that Solar Watt guarantees in writing  that the system they design will produce 100% of the electricity promised each year, or they write you a check for the difference. Certainly one of the best suppliers I have ever worked with. Feel free to ask Dave to provide you with my name as a reference.<//Text>

I knew we would benefit from solar so I entertained a door to door company's offer to talk to me.  I got multiple bids from a total of four companies and chose Solar Watt based on their industry experience and competitive pricing.  They were honest, completely transparent and a pleasure to work with.  Thanks Dave & Andrew!< /review>

<text>My wife Barbara and I had Dave Watt from Solar Watt Solutions install our solar system several years ago and believe me it was one of the best financial decisions we have ever made. He was extremely knowledgeable regarding solar operations and did not try to over sell us on extra panels or extra equipment, he knew exactly what would work for our home. We have a custom built home with custom tiles and many varying roof angles and he had his crew installed them in the best areas for maximum efficiency. His crew did an excellent job and were very quick and efficient and not a single tile was broken or damaged. The entire job took only a few days. Dave and his onsite supervisor were there every step of the way and kept us informed of their progress. When the city inspector came to certify the completed job, he had nothing but praise about the entire job and stated we would get the all clear in a few days to turn the system on which we did. We purchased our system instead of renting or leasing which was best for us, we received just over $8,000.00 credit on our taxes for that year. Our solar system has been more effective than was projected. We run our A/C quite often during the warmer months plus she has an all electric car which cost us nothing to operate. I think we have had 2 or 3 electric bills of less than $20 each but did not have to pay because it rolled over into credits which balanced out with the next statement.

SolarWatt Solutions designed the right system for our house, gave us a reasonable price, did a high quality installation on time, and we have been getting the predicted energy savings ever since.  They answered all my questions in detail and did not try to pressure us during the sales process.   We are very pleased with the result.<//Text>

Solar Watt Solutions did our solar installation in Nov 2017. We couldn’t be happier with the experience and the results. Everything from the initial consultation, the installation itself and the follow up was done with uttermost professionalism, quality and honesty. We highly recommend using them for your solar needs.

The way these guys run their business they make you feel like you have a friend in the solar business.  They have a laid back, no pressure sales approach.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable, and they hit all the overall timeline goals.  Since I had some ideas on what I wanted to choose, and what I wanted to do, they worked through different panel options/availability with me, and we found the Enphase system that would work best for my installation.  Further, when comparing quotes for different options, they were cost competitive and the most flexible with working out my roofing (pre)work.  Great installation experience at every stage!!!< /text>< pictures>

<text>Solar Watt was a pleasure to deal with from the first meeting all the way through the installation. I first met with Dave Watt (yes his name really is Watt). Dave gave me all the details and options and the difference between the different type systems that people install. There was never any pressure and you could tell that he truly meant that he would never install anything that he wouldn't put on his own house.

He set us up with Hero financing which was the easiest financing I have ever done, and the Hero folks were a pleasure to deal with. We put a high quality LG system on the house with no money out of pocket and no payments for a year. It is great watching the electric meter spin backwards. I can even monitor how much electricity I am making every hour online.

The installation team was also great. Everything was clean and professional and the system wiring looks like it is part of the house.

They say they will give you an honest evaluation whether you go with them or not and that is what I felt working with them. Of course I did end up using them, and happy I did.</text><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>
<Review>We moved into a house that already had solar, but it was poorly supplied and the previous seller told us it covered his solar bill which was in fact a lie. When I reached out to the previous installation company, they were less than helpful. Many companies did not want to touch our house because of the existing solar, but Solar Watt worked with us thoroughly so that we could come up with a plan that would work with our current system. Ollie did a great job and had great patience when both my husband and myself wants to address many concerns and questions. The job was handled professionally and swiftly. We will be referring anyone who needs solar to Solar Watt. Thank you!</Review>< Response>

<review>The bytes that bring this post to you were powered in their origination by the sun, thanks to Solar Watt Solutions.  The fingers that mashed out the keystrokes (that formed said bytes) happily wrote a final check for a beautiful 8 kilowatt array, knowing that the check was an investment that will pay off three or four times before the warranty on the panels expires.  Our goal was to make an investment over our heads would reduce our overhead as we head toward retirement, easing our anxiety about our increasing electric bill.

What we didn't know was how free of anxiety the process would be with Solar Watt Solutions.  Morgan, our sales rep, patiently and professionally kept in touch with me after an initial proposal, while I was distracted with other household projects.  When the time came to go green, owner Dave Watt completed the project in under a month... and that includes the time it took for us to spruce up the section of roof that would hold the panels.

We could not be happier with the process and the results.  My wife commented a number of times on how professional and friendly the crew was.  Dave and Morgan responded to each of my queries very quickly, always by the close of the business day and often after hours if a question hit me late.   Their math was solid, the price was right, and the results are outstanding.

I would go on and on, but I'd rather get back to checking the app that is telling us how much electricity we are generating.</review><userid>117060359439640666424<//userid><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_name>

<review>We were referred to Solar Watt Solutions and met with the President Dave Watt. My wife and I were impressed with his sincerity and his presentation.
When they came to install the solar panels we found them to be efficient, reliable, on time and met all the commitments they made to us.
We also felt they went "over the top" to make sure everything was done correctly and to our satisfaction.
Based on our experience we would highly recommend this company for your solar panels.

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>In 2015 we interviewed four (4) solar companies to give us estimates on a ground mount system that would be designed to produce as much energy as we had historically used annually (on average for the previous 5 years).  David Watt of Solar Watt Solutions was the only company that answered every question we had on site and who could design a system for our specific needs / wants and flexibility to add to in the future.  Most companies send "sales staff" out to give quotes, but when they are asked technical questions related to the investment you are about to make they (strictly sales people) defer to having to ask someone else, which was highly undesirable and less than ideal for building confidence when wanting to achieve the shortest return on your investment (ROI).  SInce 2015, Solar Watt Solutions has installed systems for a number of my friends and clients that I've sold homes too.  I have the utmost confidence in Solar Watt Solutions because of their actual pricing, performance and customer service follow up.  Hire the best when investing in energy generating solar systems.  Hire Solar Watt Solutions.
I am available if you have any questions or require additional information.</Review><response>None<//response>< userid>

We highly recommend Solar Watt for residential solar panel installation   We were on the brink of signing a lease agreement that would have foregone our tax credit and then I remembered Jim Mahoney and am so glad we reached out!  Solar Watt had our installation up & running in days and we now get CREDIT bills from SDG&E.  Our home value has increased and we are not on any payment plan.  Solar Watt was prompt, professional and attentive!<//Text>

<text>I've been looking at solar systems for the past couple years and was completely put off by the sales tactics used by other companies I met with. Then I heard about Solar Watt Solutions and decided to look into solar again. I'm so glad I made the call.

Their sales rep Jim was extremely knowledgeable and presented me with a very clear and honest assessment of my current power needs, the various panels available, and the return on investment of each option. There was no pressure and my extensive research prior to his visit confirmed that Solar Watt Solutions proposal was extremely competitive. I'm sure you could find cheaper panels somewhere, but I'm certain that you won't be gouged by this company.

Another pleasant surprise was how accurate they were on estimating when they could have the work started and finished. Their crew was very professional and had the system up and running even faster than promised.

If you want to support a local business and work with an ethical business owner (Dave Watt) who cares about both the quality of his work and his reputation in the community, look no further than Solar Watt Solutions. Our system is running flawlessly and it's so nice not having to shell out big checks to SDG&E anymore!< /text>< Pictures>

<user>105136244785191171761<//user><Text>Honesty and service is what I got from Solar Watt Solutions. SWS was recommended by a friend who had done his own installation. Dave Watt came to my house and suggested what I needed.  I told him that I wanted to do my own installation. He agreed and did calculations with his gizmo to determine the best panel number/placement and gave me a price.  He handled the permitting process and sent me the materials.  They arrived on 3 pallets in about a week and a half if I remember correctly.  The hardest part was finding the location of my trusses beneath the concrete roof tiles.  I had questions about what the plans they gave me and was able to talk to a person who clarified what I was to do.  After about 3 years one of the reporting gizmos failed, they noticed this because they must periodically monitor systems.  Dave himself came to my house, found the failure and replaced the component all free of charge. Since installation I have never owed SDG&E in fact with my 25 panels i now have a $235 credit with SDG&E. I recommend them without reservation.< /Text>< Rate>

I purchased my solar system from Solar Solutions  in 2013. My bill went from $600.00 per month (2.5 acres, pool, well) to $300.00 per Year.. I feel so strong about Dave Watt and his integrity that I have referred six friends who have also purchased from Solar Watt..</Text>

Dave and his team did a fantastic job. He was referred to me by a number of my friends from church. The quality of the installation was fantastic and we are thrilled with how everything turned out.<//Review>

< review>
We were having some issues with our Enphase Solar system connecting to our wi-fi network, and since the company who had done the install for the previous owner of our house was no longer providing service I went to the Enphase website to find another installer/service provider who might be able to help.  I found Solar Watt Solutions on the Enphase website and gave them a call.  The gentlemen with whom I spoke was very professional and courteous and let me know one of his technicians would give me a call within a couple of days.

Dave Watt gave me a call and spent almost an hour on the phone with me walking me through what needed to be done.  I finally got it connected and then later that night I saw that not all of the microinverters were sending data.  I called Enphase customer support and after some trouble-shooting the lady suggested I call my installer.  So I called Dave again and he walked me through a few steps until we got it figured out and fixed.  And all of this at no charge.

In my mind that is next-level customer service to provide that level of service to someone who isn't even your customer.  He very easily could have scheduled a service call and come out and charged me for what he did.  I would definitely recommend Solar Watt Solutions to anyone looking for a top notch solar company.< /review>

When o got into my hotel room it smelled like cigarettes. It smelled like they tried to get the smell out but couldn’t. It was very musty but we didn’t really have much of a choice. After our first night in the hotel we left for the day and came back. Our hotel hasn’t been cleaned. It was around 8 at night and we noticed that the toilet was clogged. It wouldn’t even flush down without anything in it. I noticed that it sprung a leak at the very bottom of the toilet where it touches the floor. It almost flooded the bathroom so we had to use every single towel that they provide in the room. We quickly went down to the lobby and spoke to someone which seemed like they didn’t care. They weren’t very empathetic it seemed like. They were very short and just said “here is your new room key. Drop off your old one when you get to your new room.” And that was it. Wasn’t too pleased with their service. We stayed here before a few years ago and liked it. We came back since we did like it. This time, not so much.< /review>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>Overall, the stay has been average. The rooms stay clean, service is acceptable. Water pressure is good in the showers and the soaps that they offer are pretty good. There is definitely an interesting mix of people who flow through. I've been staying here, off and on, for about two and a half weeks now and have hear and seen some weird things.

One concern is there is no screen or bars from my window on the second floor. I would assume that might be kind of a fall hazard, depending on if you had curious kids or if you had a guest who got a bit too drunk the window sill is below my waist and I'm 5'10".

My biggest gripe with the place is that the walls are very thin. If the TV isn't up loud enough, you can pretty much hear any casual talk or other "extra curricular activities" on the other side of the wall.<//Review>< pics>

The hotel was clean and the receptionist was nice at the beginning. However, the day before our check out my Dior perfume was missing. I checked everywhere in the room, even though I knew that it was in the bathroom the whole time. I went down to the receptionist to tell that my Dior perfume was missing. I told and assured her that the perfume was in the bathroom the whole time. she said that I probably  have put it next to me in bed and that I probably dropped it somewhere. The supervisor checked the room again and didn't find anything. The last housekeeper that cleaned our room before the Dior perfume was missing, her name is NORA. She denied everything before we even asked the question. She said maybe we dropped in the car. be careful of your stuff.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Not the most comfortable but it was not gross. The motel was average. The exterior & lot is dark. Can use more lighting as there are a handful of visible vagrants or meth heads lingering. The adjacent area has an abundance of fast food, dine in spots, corporate stuff and gas stations for snacks or unhealty hot food. You don't have to drive. The room itself is spacious but my room smelled funky. The sheets were good enough and the tub needed some fixing. The water drained slow during a shower and a thought of a bath in the tub is just too gross to ponder for me. The room had all the basics and it was relatively peaceful. There is a burger king or some fast food spot next door so the drive thru shenanigans might be annoying to some. The Freeway and main drag are close by but I didn't hear big rigs or annoying cars. Overall, one of the better wash and sleep spots, but i reccomend Napa if you can make it which is an hour north.Travel safely my friends.@cigarcpawww.clees.yelp.com</text>

Very nice place, although the staff doesn't tell guests to wear their masks while checking in or out which is unsafe. A bit expensive too, such a shame too because I would stay longer too.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Extremely DIRTY ‼️ From the outside to  the inside just dirty. The outside doors are supposed to be keycard access for security or safety. Theyre not. Opens right up with a twist of the handle. When i asked for a 2nd or 3rd floor room she goes to tell me they have security at night time & i can only get a first floor room. I didnt understand. Very weird... now for the room. I was given room 120. For starters the blankets were super dirty looks like someone spilled something on them & they haven’t been washed. I go to pull the sheets back & theres other peoples hair everywhere. & a dead bug just chilling by the pillows in plain view. I go to check the second bed & there was a live bug crawling on the top blanket. Didnt need to check any further. Instantly asked for a refund & will never return to this property.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Review>Was greeted by staff when first arrived at window.y check-in was fast. My room was clean no hair no where. That big gigantic bed and fluffy pillows clean smelled good. Bathroom nice an clean smelled nice. I will be returning. The price was affordable. Grounds outside kept up.

I honestly think this is my favorite hotel in this area now, very afford price matched by a three star atmosphere. Everything was perfect about my stay, but a small thing that was displeasing. It's really really easy to hear people outside your room, the people can't hear you at all which is great. But I was awakening at 5am by people outside shifting and talking. Not a huge deal just went back to sleep and it was fine. Other than that my stay was fantastic.</review>

I paid for the room on Priceline when I get there clerk tells me about a $100-150 deposit. After paying deposit, get in the room which is decent......but when 9pm rolled around it was noisy all night. Didn’t truly go to sleep until 3am. Not a good choice!👎🏾<//Text>

Positive: Beds are comfy. Housekeeping is nice. Negative: Paper thin walls! Heard everything from all ends of the neighbors. Housekeeping was nice but if you have a do not disturb sign on the door they are shouting at each other about rooms and gossip at 8am in the hall! Not a repeat!</Text>

<review>My shower was full of hair. The place has been non stop full of tweekers. VERY THIN WALLS. Don't expect good sleep in this place. Called in noise complaint with hispanics non stop telling in the halls and nothing got done. This place is absolutely terrible. Watched a lady push her grocery cart in after swiping her card to the gate. Do not come here! Unless you're from Mexico!!!</review></record>

<Review>Clean room, staff were helpful. Interestingly this is the only one, out of the many Choice hotels where we have recently stayed, that couldn't (wouldn't?) find a way to make a grab'n'go breakfast work to substitute for the hot breakfast traditionally available. They simply stated breakfast not available because of Covid-19. While this inconvenience is small, when I considered, the creative ways the other properties have accommodated this to serve their guests, the absence of breakfast  appears to simply be a cost saving maneuver giving pause to wonder what other cost economies are they taking (hygjene?) that might not be as evident.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

This place is disgusting! So dirty!! They are using any way they can to profit off of covid 19. They don't even provide coffee. Front desk staff are very rude. No customer service skills at all. Always a line of people with complaints at the front desk. We will never stay here again.<//review>

I was so upset. The lady at check was no help with anything. They had no bathroom for their customers. The front desk could not help with anything. I really want to bash this hotel, I'm not going to. Covid has taken a toll on all of us but dont let covid infect our personality. Hospitality is personality. A couple of nice words and some understanding would go a long way. Dont stay here unless you have to. I'm also a choice privilege member and I was treated with no respect.<//Text>

Covid issues. Staff is not on point in many comfort Inns as of late. No coffee in room for 2 days last week (different State) this one did not replenish coffee either. No outlets near desk for computer work. Not thrilled, but slept well. Hallway door slams shut which is unpleasant.<//Text>

Staff was very friendly, competent and courteous. Rooms were recently renovated. Breakfast was in line with other Comfort Inns. The location is very good and has close proximity to Napa.  I would definitely stay there again. My only complaint is that the room doors are noisy when they close.< /Text>

I always feel welcome here.  The staff is great, the management is great, the rooms are great and the location is great.  Big screen TVs in all the rooms (and they actually tune in all the channels from the guide (gasp!)  The rates are affordable and the other guests have always been friendly.   It's safe here and moreover I've never felt unsafe while staying here.  Book a room here if you get the opportunity and you won't be disappointed.

I've stayed here a number of times with little disappointment, but this time it was unbelievable the rooms are not properly cleaned I stayed one night checked out ended up having to stay in town another day so booked a room here again in which they put me in the room I had checked out of so I knew what had been cleaned and not cleaned when I brought it to the front desk attention she told me to talk to the owner in the morning and write something so I wrote out what I had said the next day at check out they had some lady I've never seen come out and say the owner wasn't there horrible experience and disgusted to think of how many hotels I may have stayed at that haven't been cleaned.</text>

<Review>The hotel was clean, the breakfast was just what I expected from the comfort inn brand. The staff were friendly. It was a great stay. 

Semi related: I spoke with another guest at the hotel on my way out that had his car broken into and his laptop stolen at the Dennys down the street. Be carful what you leave in your car.<//Review>< rate>

Booked this hotel with choice hotels and Once I arrived there everything became a issues with them charging my credit card. I had a late check in by the time I got there I had notifications that the hotel had been charging my card.  Choice hotel gave my credit card info to this hotel and the hotel charged me twice for my stay and a month later I still have not got a refund. The is no manager every time I call. I have left many voice mails with no response. Choice hotels also have not helped in anyway. Choice hotels gave my card info when they were not to. Worse experience ever.< /Review>

Excellent location for my barber exam. Wonderful breakfast and hot to get to it early. The room k was placed in was on the outside and would have preferred inside. I could smell the cigarette smell sealing through my door cracks even with towels on the bottom seal. I really enjoyed how close this location was to my exam.< /Review>

While the room was clean, I felt like the restroom should be renovated. The chair in the room I stayed in was dated and had animal hair. The website neglected to inform me that there is a $100 deposit on the room. This is not a simple hold on your account. This deposit was factored into the total cost of the room and I was informed at the counter that the deposit would be returned to me a week later. I still haven’t received it.<//text>

The area is safe and the staff were fine. My room appeared clean and the breakfast was good. The bed and linens seemed old an worn and could definitely use an upgrade. I was on the bottom floor and it was the loudest area I've ever stayed in. The price was excellent so overall it's not bad (request a higher floor).</Review>

Friendly and helpful staff.  The hotel is a little run down but VERY clean. Breakfast was a lot of carbs but there were also several protein sources and fresh fruit.  The hot waffles are nice.  I would definitely stay here again.</review>

The hotel has been in existence for about 35+ years and has had several brands.  There have been some upgrades of the lobby and rooms.  The hot breakfast was good, however, the room, especially the bath room and tub/shower area, was not cleaned up to expectations.<//text>

We really liked the big tv & large bed in the room. The only small issue was our guide on the tv said we had a few HBO channels & the room even had a little pamphlet of what would be on HBO that week but the channels were actually showing SHOWTIME on them. It wasn't a huge deal because I could pull it up & watch it on the computer, I just wanted to make u aware of this. And it may have just been in our room for all I know. Other than that tiny thing our stay there was great<//Text>

Only giving four stars because they don't allow pets...otherwise it's a nice place...rooms are decent sized with a huge TV and comfortable beds. Room was clean. And they got a nice little breakfast setup. Staff was pleasant. Be prepared to leave a deposit</review>

<Review>We chose this hotel because of how close it is to the freeway and we enjoyed our stay. The room was small but it was able to fit a king sized bed and a roll away bed but not much room for anything else. The rooms look updated and nice. Cleanliness was not the best but we made it work.  There was a lot of hair in the bathroom and entrance of the room and crumbs around the bed. The lady that checked us in was very friendly and accommodating. When we had issues with our keys though, we had another lady that was not so friendly. She made it seem like we purposely demagnetized the keys but it was a big inconvenience to have to go 3 times to get two keys to work</Review>< pics>

This hotel has a nice pool, gym area, great sized room, decent breakfast. But they need more staff. There was a condom wrapper in our room, no one answers the front desk phone, check in took about 45 minutes because the clerk had to walk to 3 rooms on 3 floors  to find a clean room for us. She said there was only 2 housekeepers on that day. We had to walk to the office to get pillows, remote and wifi password since they were so understaffed and not answering the phone.<//Text>

<review>Good location I guess if I have to say something. I did like that I left a message on Expedia that I would arrive for check-in at about 6:30 AM. When I arrived my reservation was cancelled and room given away. I had to pay again for a room. They gave my room away but yet had rooms available. Could not get a hold of Expedia. This is the second time this has happened with Expedia. Never again will I go with this site.< /review>< user_id>

<Review>ROOM AND FACILITIES - The room was spacious and comfortable.  The walls were on the thin side.  Breakfast was very good.
MANAGEMENT.  We had asked for a quiet room on the reservation.  The woman checking us in knew this and told us she is specifically putting us at the end of the hall as it is quiet. An hour later she checked in a room full of kids in their late teens  that were making a lot of noise. She may have meant well with us but should have known better than to plant a group of teens next to us. We called 4 times before it finally got quiet at midnight.The next morning, we asked to speak with the manager as we felt we deserved some kind of compensation  for this mismanagement and loss of sleep, especially after asking for the quiet room at time of reservation. We were told (this was on a Thurs morning) that he would not be back until Monday and would call us. After not receiving a call back, we called again on Tues ( or Wed?) and again left a message. He has not even had the decency to call us back. We are loyal Choice Hotel members  and this is really not acceptable behavior. Even if he disagreed with us, he should have called or emailed.<//Review></record>

<text>Great stay overall. Location was close to the freeway and a shopping center nearby with some different food options. Room was clean and comfortable. Check-in was quick and easy and the front desk staff was friendly. Breakfast had enough variety to get me going in the morning.

<Text>As there are other hotels in the area, I have come to rely on Comfort Inn at Cordelia.

Hotel accomodations, staff, housekeeping, receptionist, & management all earn highest prestiege, and best class star ratings... As a team, working well together, pulling together, and "making things positive happen" for all peoples/customers/clients...(including their many assortive attitudes)... My hats off. Two thumbs up. You've earned this.< /review>

<Text>We throughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly  and welcoming. We arrived after 11 pm, the front desk cheerfully and quickly checked us in. Our room was up to date and clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. Breakfast is included in the price and was a good start to the day. Nothing fancy but they do have a waffle machine, which makes great waffles, so We enjoyed breakfast too. Our stay was great start to finish.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Excellent room! Easy to make last-minute reservations especially if you're on the move down the freeway. The free breakfast was really good. Eggs, make your own waffles, juice, fruit, yogurt, pastries, sausage links, Dry Cereal. The rooms are spacious and clean. Bathrooms spacious and clean. The surrounding area is plenty safe enough for a morning walk following breakfast. No exciting attractions here. Two major freeways come together here and there are several motels and fast-food restaurants. Absolutely nothing to write home about but it's very convenient when you're traveling. Highly recommended and a great value!</Text>< UserId.>

We only stayed a short night at the hotel as we had an appointment at UCSF medical center early in the morning, and though it is still a 45 minute drive it was much more affordable than anything in San Francisco. We were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was for the price, compared with other hotels in the area. There is a nice enough pool and it looks like the hotel has been updated recently. The room was very clean, and though we had an indoor corridor room there was a locked entry providing safety even for the outdoor corridor rooms. The staff was very friendly. We will stay there again.<//Text>

Stayed at this hotel for our Six Flags trip. We have stayed here before and have been happy so decided to come back. I will say that I have never paid this much money for the room though! very expensive!  The room was very clean and the bed so comfortable! Our service was great with both our check in and check out attendants very personable,efficient, and nice to talk too. Breakfast  was fine.   Lady running the breakfast was very efficient and very very sweet. Location was great for us As we were about 15 to 20 minutes away from Six Flags and there are many restaurants and  services close by.</review>

<user>None< /user><review>My stay at the Fairfield Comfort Inn was pretty average. The room was very nice but everything else was below expectations. I was given the a room that was already assigned to someone else, and I had to go back to the front desk to get a new set of keys for a new room. The receptionist didn't speak English that well (which isn't her fault but she tried to cover up her mistake) and dealing with this issue took a lot longer than normal. The hotel facility was mediocre and had a slight smell lingering in the hallways. I wouldn't recommend coming here, but in a pinch this place can do the job.< /review><Rating>None<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

I would absolutely stay at this hotel location again. It covered all my Spring Break Vacation needs for myself and my 8 year old grandson. Hotel in general and room comfortable and very fresh and clean. Check in was a breeze and welcoming. Breakfast......Amazing! The morning staff in the breakfast room always made sure everything was kept stocked and clean. When ever I crossed paths with a Comfort Inn Staff member, they were always kind and smiling! There are lots of choices for great meals in the area and wonderful recommendations from the front desk.
This will be my go to place to say! Thank you Comfort Inn for making our stay pleasant!</review>

The check-in process was smooth and entering and exiting property post-midnight very easy with access card. The room was spotless. I was only there for less than two hours :). I used my employee discount and will continue to do so on slower days and/or weekdays only. I checked out by leaving my key in the room and making sure everything was turned off on my way out. I did have an issue with the window curtains though (they did not close). I was just afraid someone could see me. Thankfully, it was an upstairs room. Great room and location.<//Text>

I stayed two nights at this motel because of the great rate of 67.00$. On the first night's stay I was charged  two 100.00$ incidental fees. I was told they would clear after I checked out. This was not a true statement because three days later one of the 100.00 fees posted to my account.  Ok no problem  mistakes happen. But after reaching out to the hotel manager to rectify the situation  he doesnt respond to voice messages and he is never in the office. So after four days I call the corporate headquarters and make a complaint.  Now I warning other potential customers be aware of their company practices. Now
I understand why they have a 2.5 rating on Priceline.  Next time I won't go for the cheapest motel I can find.< /text>

<Text>Mine could be one off or it might be the norm, When I should up with a baby at 1.00 AM, the front door was locked with a sign - No Vacancy, tried calling, the phone was on mute. Finally got in, got my room which I had booked through Choice website only to learn I got a King instead of 2 Queen for 3 Adult and a Baby. They acted as if I did I even book through what, then gave me a roller bed. The thing that got me was, I was told - It will not be charged, To start with I dint need a roller bed as I had booked correctly but you gave away my room.

The Room was nice, still can see the renovation marks in bath. Shower dint help due to high efficiency shower heads, may be it is the norm in California. Breakfast was good with Eggs and Sausages. No hot water for Oats or Baby cereal, just an FYI. I would stay again as along as they hold the room I book cos if I dot not show up or cancel I am still going to be charged for what I booked and not what was held back for me.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

We stayed for about a total of 6 nights in two separate stays at this hotel about 10-15 miles from Napa has the properties as the properties in Napa Valley are too expensive. decent rally for the money but weekends are more expensive than we expected as the rate jumped. friendly staff and clean property.
Just one suggestion on the breakfast at all Choice Hotels which are pretty much the same thing everywhere is that they should offer more of the healthier choices instead of pre-prepared junk and sugary cereals. It would be nice if they had vegan/vegetarian, low sugar and low-fat choice in the breakfast<//text>

I booked online yet people were walking in and paying far less. She wouldn’t let me use my triple A card and requesting a $200.00 deposit, not a card to hold as a deposit but an actual charge is ridiculous. I still have not been reimbursed.<//review>

It was close enough to be an easy commute and far enough away to be less expensive than Napa. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast room and choices were great. The morning breakfast staff lady was awesome and helpful.

There did not seem to be many decent restaurants nearby- it was all mainly fast food. We ended up eating in Fairfield.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808513b5b27d7ad5:0xfdfc96bb4c9e8804</gmapID></record>

This hotel was greatly priced for the quality of my stay. I stayed on a sunday night, the prices are in my opinion way too overpriced for Friday and Sat nights (same price as very upscale hotels in area). But for the rest of the week its an amazing deal. This is not a fancy high end hotel by any means, but it is clean, quiet, the beds are comfortable, and the staff is very friendly. Overall will be  staying  again.< /Review>

Hotel had comfortable beds and pillows, nothing overly special about the place.  The location is pretty good.  I usually don't stay on bottom floors, and of course, was given one.  It wasn't too bad... I felt safe.<//review>

<text>We were 100% satisfied with every aspect of our stay. The breakfast was really good, especially those waffles! The hostess promptly refilled the sausage and eggs trays as needed. Lots of fruit and cereal choices, there's something for everyone in the breakfast room.
The beds were super comfortable and the duvets very clean and fluffy. This hotel has easy access on and off I-80 which is a real plus. Several dining options within a few steps of the hotel including a very nice Denny's. Highly recommend this Choice Hotel!</text></record></dataset><record>

Check in took longer than it should. The public and room spaces were clean and well appointed. The walls are thin. I could hear the conversations of the guests next door as well as them having sex at 1am.

It is probably a good hotel for the price. I wanted an inexpensive hotel because I was only staying one night and leaving at 6am.< /Review>

<Text>At first I thought all was well.  But I was given a room far away when I was told would have easy access... I was moving my friend's deseased mother's belongings and had to haul a lot of it into my room.  They had to re-key my key 6x before it worked which meant 6 trips hauling heavy items.  Since some was jewelry I had to keep hauling it back and forth with me.  When I expressed my displeasure, they became angry with me!!  Crazy!!  Worst hospitality ever!  I left and went down the street.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>It was a pleasant surprise that this low cost hotel was so comfortable. It also has amenities lacking in more costly lodgings. The friendly staff were genuinely helpful. The rooms large and furnishings near new. There was coffee available in evening as well as morning.< /Text>< user_id>

Have stayed here a couple of times. It is a clean and comfortable roadside stop. Nothing fancy. The morning breakfast helps get you started for the day, but is not remarkable either. Because the price varies, I don't hesitate to stay here when it is the best bargain on my way through, but have chosen others for the same reason. No major complaints.</review>

<Rate>None< /Rate><review>Nice hotel, staff was friendly, and the bed was SUPER comfortable!!  Breakfast was pretty good but waffle batter was too thick (waffle turned out dry and crunchy) and I would recommend the hotel serve scrambled eggs at the breakfast buffet, as the "fried" eggs that were in the warmer looked like rubbery pucks.  (I had a hard boiled egg instead) but it was a free breakfast so can't complain too much. Overall, we enjoyed our stay!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

This place is probably my favorite hotel near this location. The beds are plush. The bathrooms are huge. The hotel is surrounded by all kinds of restruants. Whenever possible, I'll try to book here. The only downside is they are becoming increasingly more expensive over the years. I used to be able to stay the weekend for 160. Today, sometimes they'll charge 200+ for one weekend night.</review>

<Review>Well I feel like I need to warn people so this will be rather long... Take the time to read it if you are thinking about staying here at the Comfort Inn...

We stayed here this past week and I came to the front desk Wednesday morning and they informed me that my car had been broken into in broad daylight at 9:15am.  I had $3000 dollars worth of personal items stolen from my vehicle... Including my laptop which had photos from the last 15 years of my life.

One week prior to our stay, a car was actually stolen out of the parking lot.

Two weeks before that there was a man trying to get into the hotel windows at 11pm.  Although we informed the hotel that a man was trying to break in, they did nothing. They didn't even have the authorities come out. There are literally STILL HAND PRINTS on the windows outside the hotel from when people were trying to break in!.... You can see for yourself.

After speaking with the local law enforcement, we found out that people's cars were getting broken into and stolen almost every other week in the PARKING LOT OF THIS hotel.  While the authorities are trying to nail down these criminals, the cops mentioned that the hotel is not doing it's part in addressing this horrible problem. And as a side note, the manager of the hotel never even showed his face the day I lost all of my things. While it may not be the hotel's responsibility, it is when it's affecting and impacting your customer's lives and it also is when people are actually trying to break in the hotel windows.

I lost so much. I'm devastated and heart broken. I would not want anything like this to happen to anyone else while staying here.  This hotel does charge a good amount for their rooms.... You may as well pay $30 extra and stay at a Marriott in a nicer (safer) area.

THIS IS NOT A SAFE PLACE TO STAY.
The hotel owner and manager do not care at all about customer care and service. And the officer even told us that the front attendants and manager literally hide everytime a crime has gone down on comfort inn property.

Although the hotel itself is much better than a super 8 or Americas value inn, it's not worth putting yourself, your family, and your belongings in so much danger.

I just hope this helps save someone the pain that me and others have had to endure here.<//Review><Time>1539317041957<//Time>< UserId.>

<text>Not sure why everyone is so generous with the reviews/ratings. I also noticed that not everyone was charged a deposit. Some say their deposit was $100, but my mine was $200!!!! I hope their deposits are not based in a discriminatory way. When I paid for the room online, it was not mentioned that there would be a hold. The room itself was very overpriced at around $150.  So I paid a total of $350 on my card! The hallways were not that clean. At about 10:50, a super rude male staff member went around to rooms, telling people it's time for check out. He banged on my door especially hard and yelled that is time to go. Is this real life???  On a positive note, the breakfast was surprisingly good. One of the best because they offered meat, scrambled eggs, waffle maker, and a variety of other breads and pastries, yogurts, etc. There was an older black woman running the breakfast area and she was the only staff member that made me feel welcomed. Give her a raise!  I have made a vow to never book a room in any Vallejo hotels ever again. It seems to be a theme to give mediocre customer service  to certain people or residents of the city. This is the 2nd overpriced hotel that require a deposit during check-in.< /text>< Time>

< Review>
We wanted to do the wine tasting in Sonoma CA, but did not want to pay the astronomical prices of Sonoma hotels.  The Comfort in Cordelia "fit the bill".  Everything was "better than expected".  The property is a bit outdated but the room, the cleanliness and the breakfast were "better than expected" and the staff was great.  The hotel is about 30min from Sonoma which is fine.  There is good access to restaurants next to the hotel (walking distance).  We would stay there again.</Review>

<Rating>None< /Rating><Review>This was my first time staying at the Comfort Inn in Fairfield and my second time staying at a Comfort Inn facility. The staff was really friendly, especially the breakfast staff. If you're turned off by the idea of a wimpy "continental breakfast," think again. Comfort Inn has stellar breakfasts: plate-sized waffles, syrup, cereal, muffins, pastries, yogurt, orange juice, apple juice, coffee, tea, milk, eggs, sausage, apples, and bananas. If you figure a very conservative estimate of $5 a person for breakfast (and far fewer food options for that amount at any fast food place), it's actually a pretty great deal. The beds were very comfortable and there were so many places to eat lunch and dinner within walking distance of the hotel. There was also an ARCO gas station right near the hotel that had one of the most inexpensive prices on gas that we'd seen in the area. I was there to go to Six Flags in Vallejo. The Comfort Inn in Fairfield was less expensive than the one in Vallejo and the amusement park was only about an 18 minute drive away, so it was well worth it. I definitely recommend this hotel.< /Review>< pictures>

Online, I saw that they were hiring so I applied. I met the qualifications and I got an Interview Invite from Luis at Comfort Inn. When I went into the interview, they asked my name and age. I told them my name, and that I'm 17 years old. But the lady that never told me her name said that I have to be 18, because sometimes drugs or alcohol is found in the rooms. Understandable, but why the hell would they mention in the requirements that I have to be 16 years or older?  If being 18 or older was REALLY a requirement, why did they invite me to the interview? That was all just a waste of my time. But I guess if you're going to be a guest at this hotel, they must have good employees already since it seems they're really picky on who they hire. Also, according to the call that my dad made to them to ask them about all this, they said they're not even hiring. Hmm. That's a bit odd.</text>

<Review>improved from last year.

Good to have this hotel as a stop to the final trip to Napa.
I like the coffee in the lobby.
It has hot water too.
If it provides snacks it's even better.
At least some bagels.
The lobby is small though. Not enough room for large group of people to check in.
The gym is improved from last year. But still sub-par.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< Pics>

I go the San Francisco to see my surgeon.  It is very expensive to stay in the city, and we have been staying in your hotel for 5-6 years, at the Fairfield, and at other locations, in Portland, Oregon, and i n Yakima, Washington when we visit family.  We enjoy knowing that we will always find a clean, comfortable room.  This stay is, I hope, an isolated incident, rather than a regular happening.  I trust I am not wrong.</Review>

The suite was beautiful and roomy. We did request a crib which was not available upon our arrival.... but we sandwiched my toddler in the king bed with us just fine. We had brought wine back to our suite from Napa but the hotel had no cork screws available :( I was so surprised because we were so close to wine country. Even the store across the street was sold out of them. So, obviously it's a needed item. Might want to keep one at the front desk for guests to borrow! Otherwise our stay was great. Our bed was very comfy.</review>

<Rating>None</Rating><Review>This hotel was a good value in comparison to rates at other similar hotels during our stay.  However, among Choice Hotels that we've stayed at, this one was not as nice.  While this hotel was clean and the good-sized rooms mostly updated,   our room's shower surround had dated tile (our room had mildew stains around the tub and in some of the grout even though there was a vent in the bathroom).  The room decor was serene and understated; the king size bed had nice sheets and pillows (although the mattress did sag in the middle). The breakfast room was neat and clean; the breakfast offering more than just a continental breakfast with coffee, bagged tea, hot water, waffle maker (with a choice of 2 kinds of batter, but unfortunately only 1 waffle machine), sausage, eggs (hard-boiled, too), danish, fresh fruit (banana, apple, orange), yogurt and instant oatmeal.  Parking was easy, adequate and free.  Check-in was smooth.  2 newspapers were offered for free in the lobby.<//Review></record>

The place is beautiful lots of space and the room theme is luxurious. Kids loved to swim at even 7pm cuz of the heated pool and experience all people should have.

<user>None< /user><Review>We traveled from Michigan. We stayed at this hotel for 8 nights. It was me, my husband , and 16 month old son. We were very pleased with the hotel and staff. There was a little remodeling going on during our stay but it didn't affect us at all. It is was nice to know they are doing their best to keep the hotel updated. We loved the breakfast. There were so many options. We were very impressed. It was also nice easy access to do laundry on site. It was a great stay the week of Christmas. You couldn't beat it for the price. We are very happy customers. Thank You Fairfield Comfort Inn Staff.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>We have stayed here twice now and both times were great experiences. The gentleman on our last stay was warm and inviting and engaged in genuine conversation. This stay was no different, with the two young ladies working being helpful and friendly to all our guests in the party.
They even had a problem with one of the two rooms we booked and promptly took care of it and upgraded us to a suite since the hotel was booked solid.
Included in this stay, the breakfast was put together nicely and the crew who took care of it both times we've stayed were on top of things and happy to serve your needs.
Great place every time and conveniently located off the exit.< /Text>< Rate>

No early check in although I had called early in the day to request. When I did check in after 4 p.m. the first room I was assigned had not been made up.

This hotel is in a convienient location with many necessary ammenities! I stay here for work and always get the rest and comfort I need. It's my "home away from home" since I work in the Bay Area and live in Paradise, CA. The accomodations are excellent and the staff is wonderful; it's a great value! I would recomend the Comfort Inn in Fairfield(Cordelia) to anyone!<//text>

This hotel has made many useful improvements and updates to their rooms. The staff are friendly and helpful at all times. We feel that we have made friends with the staff and management here over the past year. Considering the hundreds of guests that they deal with, it amazes us that they remember us personally every time we visit. We have stayed here overnight many times in the past year because I had major surgery at UCSF in San Francisco. The frequent check-ups mean a long arduous trip every two months. It is a good place to stop and rest after 250 miles of travel from our home in northeastern California. They make it as comfortable as possible for us and have always met any and all special needs we might have if it is in their power to do so. They also have a full and wholesome breakfast starting at 6 am. in a spacious dining area.<//Text>

Stayed there to travel to San Francisco the next day. The rooms was accommodating. A fridge and micro was a plus, since we had Chinese food leftovers. Bed and pillow was comfortable. The Internet was a little slow, but I got done what I needed to.

Breakfast was surprisingly good and was well stocked. There are plenty of wating establishments within walking distance. I would stay there again.< /Text>

I was recommended to this hotel by a friend that had stayed here for her stateboard exam. I am so glad I went with her recommendation. They were accommodating to those of us staying for our test and very friendly. It was nice not having to think about breakfast before my exam as they have plenty of good food and will let you in early if you're an exam taker. Highly recommend for any stateboard examinees!< /review>

The carpet and chairs had stains. The track to the closet was filthy and there was a bolt sticking up out of the carpet next to it. The shower had a few dirt marks. The back of the bathroom door was warped at the bottom. The overall feeling was that it was not clean. The hotel definitely needs upgrading.</Text><user_id>None</user_id>< date>

The rooms are nicely furnished, bed is extremely comfortable, and little touches like a lap desk, multiple choices of pillows, etc., make a great impression. Bathrooms are good-sized, and I appreciated the offer of forgotten toiletries from the front desk. I only drink decaf, and appreciated being given more than the one (1) extra I requested. Breakfast is pretty good - would always prefer bacon to sausage, but that's just a small personal wish. Two choices of eggs, lots of cereals, oatmeal, breads, fresh waffles, yogurt, fresh fruit and multiple juices. Very well done for a free breakfast. Definitely a keeper, and a great base for the greater Bay Area.</Text>< pics>

Rooms are clean, walls are thin, not the quietest but beds are comfy and the bathtub is of good size not the narrow small jobs elsewhere. It is near all kinds of food which is nice but if you wait too late in the morning the bfast buffet is stripped and they don't refill it so you're left with cereal and waffles . staff was nice and accomodating. It is good for the price.<//Text>

This is a good hotel, and a lot of the problems with cleanliness seem to be largely dealt with.  Also, wi-fi was some of the best I've seen, and that definitely matters to me.  As others have mentioned, the pot smokers are a problem.  It's legal here, but the smell of pot in a hotel is definitely still associated with something fairly divey.  They need to kick these people out if they can legally do so.<//review>

Even though check in is supposed to be at 3pm, we couldn't check in until 4pm because they didn't have rooms ready. They seem short-staffed. Rooms aren't properly cared for because carpet is dirty, you can smell cigarettes in non-smoking rooms, and rooms have bad sound-proof if it's one of the non-hall ones. Rooms come with a comfy-enough bed, fridge, and microwave, though. Continental breakfast is decent, too. Overall, not worth the base price so it's best if you can somehow get a much cheaper price.< /review>

I preferred the quieter setting than that of other similar and higher priced lodging which was next to noisy Highway 80 at Suisun.
It has many fast food places and a pub nearby and costs less than lodging in Sonoma or Napa.

The room was large, has a good rural view on quiet east side of building, had microwave, fridge on floor,
one room bathroom, VERY comfortable bed, flat screen television.

It has the standard breakfast with processed cereals, breads,
eggs, sausages and boiled eggs, juices and some fresh fruit. Sometimes I'd rather pay less for the night, and eat a more custom breakfast elswehere, but it was convenient.

The property is situated next to a nature path and waterway, which is an asset  for relief from stress of driving and urban traffic. May see waterfowl and wildlife, always a benefit!
I recommend this above all the other lodging available at this Cordelia/ Suisun exit.</review>

<Review>This hotel is comfortable, clean and quiet. The air conditioning worked well and so did the internet. The pay in advance rate was good. I enjoyed the choice of both soft and fluffy pillows. The bed was comfortable. The breakfast is standard and nothing to get excited about, but it did give us something to get started on for the day. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a good nights stay.<//Review></record>

<Text>Most of the rooms appear to have been remodeled. The last room I stayed in was in need of minor repairs. The safety latch for the main door was missing and door to the bathroom was in need of repair. Overall the rooms are nice. I would recommend this place. Due to how close it is to the Napa Valley Wine Country the hotel can get busy and pricey.< /Text>< pictures>

We were looking for a hotel to stay at while visiting the bay area and Discovery Kingdom and found this one on trip advisor. The hotel is very clean and quiet. The beds are very comfy and the heater/air-conditioner works quietly and efficiently. Staff is very helpful and even took the time to find us a room in the front of the hotel upon my request. Breakfast in the morning is tasty but basic. We will definitely stay in this hotel again. Only 10 minutes from Discovery Kingdom and 25 minutes from San Francisco. :)< /text>

I went in to check in. The desk lady was rude and said you can’t check in until 4. It was 2pm. Paperwork said 3 Check-in. The next morning went to shower no hot water. Even after 30 mins. Floors were kinda nasty and sticky<//text>

I recently stayed at this hotel on my way to San Francisco. In the past I've had some other problems at a choice hotel (which doesn't happen often) in the are and decided to go a little bit out of the way and found this hotel to be a great value and place to stay.

Each time I've stayed here in the past year (approx. 3 times) I've had a great experience. The staff is super friendly and helpful. My kids when they travel with me enjoy the breakfast items and they are a hard sell.

The facility is up-to-date and the rooms have always been clean and fresh. It's in proximity to several places to eat and not too far off the interstate.

The only negative I've had there is the wifi. Often times it's slow and somewhat difficult to log on with my personal devices. However the rest of the experience far outweighs this inconvenience.

Overall out of the 40+ nights a year I stay at Choice Hotels this one is one I never have to worry about when checking in for the night.<//review>

We had a very comfortable stay, everything was clean, quality, with an emphasis on conservation, which we feel is important.  Perhaps the styrafoam bowls could have been replaced with paper wax-coverred ones, but the overall attention to no waste was very much appreciated.  Everyone was pleasant and helpful, and it felt like a safe, well-run place!<//Text>

First time at a Comfort Inn. They live up to their name in terms of bed comfort!
I’d say I’ve slept better here than at other high-end hotels. Customer service is good too, greeting and status recognition.< /Review>

<text>I think the walls might be made out of paper, because I could here everything that was going on in the other rooms. I had an important meeting next morning and unfortunately I didn't sleep at all. The sheets where a bit dirty, but overall the noise is my biggest issue. Probably one of the worst night I had in a hotel.</text>< rate>

<review>I was driving from the Bay Area to Sacramento late last week. I was tired and Cordelia looked like a good location to stop. Comfort Inn had rooms available at a very reasonable price. Rooms were clean and most importantly, the bed was comfortable. The Value to experience is key for me. I have stayed at great hotels around the world as well as hostels. When the Value to Experience is high, I give it thumbs up, which I do for this location.</review></record>

Raining upon arrival and pleased that our room was ready early. Bed was comfortable, bathroom nice. We just needed a place to shower and sleep before heading to volleyball tournament next morning. Breakfast was good, ready early enough for us to enjoy. Lots of fast food places nearby.<//Review>

It was a great spot for our family vacation. Right off of the freeway with plenty of restaurants within walking distance. We are right in the middle of all the places that we wanted to visit. San Francisco, Sacramento and the Napa Valley.
We also enjoyed the city of Fairfield as we visited the Jelly Belly factory.< /Text>

<user_id>None<//user_id><Text>Everything was nice and comfortable. The only downside was that along with half of Fairfield we were told to come back at 3:30 pm to check in bc housekeeping were still cleaning rooms. Well, EVERYBODY showed back up and still had to wait for rooms. Then after my 2nd day there, I got a knock on my door, and was asked what time I was checking out bc the room needed to be cleaned for another customer. I had paid in advance for 4 days. So, had to call downstairs to make sure everything was corrected.
After that fiasco, the rest of my stay was good. Nice breakfast and hot coffee. And lots of places to eat. Some just steps away from the hotels front door.< /Text></record>

Walked into room and bed had strange dried liquid substance on it. Floor had dried substance aswell. Bathroom had what looked like makeup wiped on walls. We went and spoke to the desk attendant so we could atleast get new bedding. She stated we dont have any services here this time of night to handle that. Im guessing all room service attendants were gone. So she said she would change our room for you. After a few hours not hearing back from desk attendant we gave up trying due to she didnt even care. We then went to bed. We have photos of the room if necessary. I dont know how far this message will go but there is a need for improvement. I hope to want to use comfort inn in the near future for my other family vacations.< /Text>

We made a late afternoon reservation for that evening, following a late concert in SF. The reservation clerk was perfectly courteous, assured us a 12-12:30 AM check-in was no problem, and even asked if I was able to read my credit card out loud... that was a 1st. Nice clean room, comfortable bed, nice sheets & pillows, hot breakfast w/ waffles, eggs toast, bagels, yogurt, fruit etc. Excellent value, would definitely stay there again!</text>

<Text>I love Choice Hotels. And rarely post complaints. My recent stay at Comfort Inn Cordelia was nothing short of disappointing and embarrassing. I brought my staff for a getaway to San Fran. The hotel was undergoing renovation. I get it. I have stayed at hotels under renovation before, and enjoy the discounts that sometimes come. Not the case here. I paid more than average for my rooms. When my staff and I arrived, everything looked fine. When we got to our wing, however, the place looked like a war-zone. Overwhelming smell of fresh paint - no apparent efforts to air it out or do clean up. Plastic all over the floor with paint chalk on our shoes. And most awkward, no numbers on any of the doors. We literally guessed our rooms by looking for the number pattern outside and trying our cards in doors. Pretty embarrassing, considering I was bringing other guests... Our room also smelled overwhelmingly of paint.

All that said - this experience probably won't happen to you if you come. But, lack of discernment by management may reflect the overall excellence of hotel management. I wouldn't risk it, if I were you!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Nice place to stay if doing off site day trips. Room is just right for sleeping. For a family of 4, it would not be comfortable staying in the room all day as only had 2 chairs. Swimming pool temperature was above normal and I was happy. No hot tub. Don't count on breakfast as being a complete meal. Id stay again when I am in town. Close to Napa and less than hour from San Francisco.<//review><Time>1438992000000</Time>< name>

Room was very nice, was upgraded to a suite, but had some plumbing maintenance issues.  Toilet seat was broken (very cheap) and handle was about to fall off the shower faucet, making it difficult to adjust the flow and temp of water. All else was very nice and clean.</review>

We rented the King Suite and it was quite roomy and comfortable. The French doors to the bedroom close off the sleeping area from the dining and living area which makes it quite private. The pull out sofa is not bad for a sofa bed. Overall, good quality for a fair price.</Text>

The Comfort Inn Cordelia is conveniently located by Highway 80. While it adds about 20 minutes to get to Napa, it is fairly inexpensive, clean, and adjacent to a Seven Eleven and Denny's. Included breakfast has most of the usual items and is complete but not luxurious.

We found the staff to be helpful and service was quick. Depending on your Napa travels it adds a few minutes to your driving but the roads are relatively clear and we experienced no issues between the hotel and the town of Napa. basically a good value unless you are really strapped for time and wish to spend more money to be somewhat closer to the places you intend to visit. Adds 40 minutes total to your driving over being in the town of Napa.</review>

This hotel is very clean and convenient for any traveling. It has easy access to the freeway and plenty of fast food restaurants nearby. I would highly recommend getting new beds.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. I want to give special recognition to the lady handling the breakfast room. She did a wonderful job of keeping everything clean and supplied while helping guests when needed. She never slowed down and was constantly working to keep everything at an exceptional level.< /text>

Everything at this hotel is above standard. The rooms are large, comfortable and very clean as was the bathroom. We always had plenty of towels and face cloths on had. Staff is very friendly and good at their jobs. Desk clerk and check in was effortless. We would stay here again if we are in the area. The breakfast was wonderful., eggs, sausage, waffles, toast, hot and cold cereals to choose from. A good assortment of breads and rolls, juice, and other items as needed.< /text>

With the price you pay, you'd expect a much more pleasant stay. The rooms are really small, the bathrooms definitely need some bleach, (probably due to not giving staff sufficient time to clean because they seemed to be in and out rather quickly) and we had a friendly big spider greet us this morning. In the morning, their "hot free breakfast" wasnt available due to a staff member taken home the keys and not even lobby coffee was offered. The staff was, however, rather pleasant - well, three of them. When faced to have to try to book for an extra night, unwillingly due to missing a flight, hotel prices raised over $100 that night. A staff member went above and beyond to help find sister hotels with better pricing, but all were pretty relatable. When I asked to speak to manager to discuss, the manager refused. I understand business, however; have courtesy to speak to customer at least. They were going to get 3 stars but the managers inconsideration caused it to decrease. Don't waste your cash/ time here.</Text>

Had a great checkin, upgraded to a suite by the staff...just because (I think it's because we came via motorcycle and were very hot and tired when we arrived and they felt we deserved it?). I think we would have been just as happy with what we originally booked. Very comfy bed and it was clean. Shower needed a little more attention but otherwise was great.</Text>

This Comfort Inn definitely needs updating and did not come up to our expectations for a stay at a Comfort Inn. The $100 deposit at check-in was unexpected. We rented two rooms and found this to be an unpleasant surprise.</text>

Good, inexpensive place to stay. Room was adequate and fairly updated. Complementary coffee in the lobby was a nice touch. However, the walls seem very thin. I could hear my neighbors, it sounded like there were a bunch of children in there stomping around and making a lot of noise. I let it go, since they stopped after 11pm, but I would hesitate to stay there again because of the noise issue.</Text>

The breakfast was nothing special. There needs to be more choices, another waffle maker and the items weren't replenished despite a crowded dining room so people were getting frustrated. What made this stay were the front desk people. They were extremely friendly, helpful and you could tell truly cared about making your stay a pleasant one.

The comfort inn cordelia worked out great for us, we needed to stay one night as my daughter was taking her state boards the next day and this hotel was close and near many food establishments and gas stations, better price than the other hotels near by and i believe just as nice as the competition, they had refrigerators and microwaves which i find valuable & a solid breakfast included. I was very satisfied with my stay here and would recommend this hotel to family and friends.</review>

I went up to there to take my Stateboard Exam. And decided to stay up there for the night before the exam. My stay at the Comfort Inn Cordelia was a great experience no hiccups or anything negative! Everything was smooth from checking-in, to the staffs, to my room.

And I passed my exam. I'm licensed now.

Thanks Comfort Inn Cordelia was making my experience a great one!</Text>

Good sized parking lot, fairly well lit. Checked in quickly by an efficient and friendly desk clerk. Asked for and was assigned 3rd floor room. My King room was mostly clean, nicely furnished and decorated. Some early signs of wear on furniture. AC Heat unit worked great. Got a good nights' sleep in a comfortable bed. In-room coffee in the morning. The shower was not that great - temperature oscillating between scalding and freezing. When checking out at 7 am, the front desk was not staffed. Waited 10 minutes, even tried calling main hotel number from my cell phone, to no avail. Clerk finally nonchalantly showed up and checked me out. Nearly late for my early morning appointment due to the wait time at the front desk :(</Review><Time>1454976000000< /Time><userid>None< /userid>< Pics>

We stayed 4 nights and had a great time visiting Napa and surrounding area. did not mind the the 20 min drive each day. And for the price of this room you could not stay in a roach motel in Napa for twice the price of Cordelia comfort inn. Rooms were clean and staff was great enjoyed the breakfast each morning. What else do you need?
Will be staying here aging.</Review>

<text>The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The breakfast was decent, but not quite as much variety as we are accustomed to at other hotels. The breakfast lady was very nice and quick to keep everything stocked. We were extremely disappointed in the room.

Very reasonable price for a quality room and good WIFI. Breakfast is free and tea is complimentary. Would like a snack bar as an option, with some liquor to go with that. Was on business and they discounted my price which was generous. Was looking forward to checking out Comfort Inn and am a big fan.</review>

<review>Room was large, clean, had A/C, free on-site parking, comfortable bed, and a decent breakfast each morning. I was able to run on the adjacent creek's exercise path each morning. My husband used the gym at the hotel but was disappointed when most machines didn't work. Before booking, just check the distance from this hotel to wineries you might be visiting. We knew this was a bit of a drive, and after a long day of wine tasting, you might prefer something closer to the wineries.<//review><response>None<//response><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rate>

This hotel was comfortable however the check-in process was painful. There were three of us trying to check in and the woman at the desk kept taking calls on the phone, one of which took no fewer than eight minutes. We were all pretty blown away by the rudeness exhibited by the desk clerk. No apologies just made you feel pretty much like a nobody.< /review>

<Date>1549357928542<//Date><rating>2</rating><Text>The check in process was awful. Instead of just calling me to verify I had sent my partner ahead to check in for me, they demanded pictures of his and my driver's lisences, which required me to send a picture and then they scanned it off my partner's phone... Not smart.

Then the room smelled strongly of marijuana smoke and there was cellophane covering the smoke detector. Shower faucet was broken. Dirty, unkempt appearance from outside the hotel. Room was okay.

There were dumpsters in the far end of the lot so parking was limited during the day.

Very loud with people laughing and talking loudly in the main hall exiting the front office until late night/ early morning.

Signs posted everywhere saying to remove valuables from your car, that property owners are not liable for break ins, and that unauthorized parked vehicles will be towed. Sounds to me like a high risk area to park...

Had I known then what I know now I would have much rather chosen a slightly higher price hotel right across the street for the quality improvement.

Overall, disappointed in the quality of this hotel. Hopefully they will make changes for the better.<//Text>< Pictures>

The Comfort Inn in Cordelia is always my first choice, when staying in the Bay Area.
The location is an easy driving distance to both Napa and Walnut Creek, so I stay here often.
The bed is so comfortable, and the linens are pristine perfect, and I love having several pillows ( to choose firm or soft). The room is lovely and very clean.My car is always safe nearby, and the staff is great!
I look forward to my next visit.< /review>

The hotel staff were overall very helpful and friendly during our three night stay. The breakfast was fabulous; waffles, eggs, sausage, yogurt, coffee, pastries... My friend and I were very pleased with our stay at this hotel. The location was very central for the area. We attended a wedding in Napa at the end of our stay and were able to easily access shopping via the freeway the rest of our stay.<//review>

Dirty, unprofessional service. They charged me $100 because the room apparently smelled like a dog but I don't own a dog and I showed them proof (kind of impossible to hide a dog). When I started to get upset after showing proof, they threatened to call the police on me. This was probably the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel. I wouldn't even give it 1 star.<//review>

The Comfort Suites Inn at Cordelia, near Fairfield is a wonderful option to paying a small fortune to stay in San Francisco.  Just think of all the wonderful dinners, ball games, sighting seeing adventures you can have with the all the money you save.  Just plan your drives into the city to go against commute and you have it made!</Review>

<Review>Very comfortable beds and pretty quiet but the hotel needs updating. We had to walk outdoors a bit to get to our room past smoking guests. the rugs in our room were very stained and it just didn't feel clean. we are in the area several times a yr and this was a recon stay. probably will not stay again until it is renovated.< /Review>< pics>

Overall my stay at the Comfort Inn Cordelia was exactly what I was looking for.  The room was clean and quiet, the staff friendly and helpful.  I got the work I needed to get done overnight, slept well, had a reasonably good (free) breakfast, and was on my way without any problems!<//review>

Notified front desk. Didn't change conditions to our notice. Maybe we finally fell asleep. We wouldn't stay at this hotel again. Not up to par with other Comfort Inns. Also shows signs of age. Needs updating especially in the bathroom.<//text>< Pics>

My family and I are here to visit six flagS.   We usually stay closer to the park I’m glad we didn’t this time.   The drive only took a few minutes longer then the hotel we usually stay at  end it was worth it.  The room was clean the breakfast offered a lot of choices  and they have a pool which was a big plus the kids!<//Text>

This hotel turned out to be a lovely happy hotel staff helping anyway they can always smiling. Plenty of fast food restaurants walkable. Little pool to take a dip and a gym. Good antique barn nearby and a shopping mall so all in there for you to have a nice time. ALSO the pillows are to die for!!!!!<//Review>

The location is in a area where you can walk to breakfast, lunch, dinner and coffee and drinks. I am going to say that the room was as good as the name of the hotel and I have to say that I give them 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ and I will be recommending that all my friends, family, and associates stay there and relax there body and mind.</Review>

The first room the head of the bed was slanting meaning the foot was higher. When we went down to registration she had to call housekeeping to go with us before we got a different room. We went down to breakfast at 800 there was no eggs r sausage left and the person responsible was no where to be found. We left. I am a rewards member and stay at comfort Inn when we travel. I will not stay here again r recommend this hotel</text>

<text>We've been guests at this hotel whenever we want to stay overnight in the Napa area. It's a bit of a drive from the wineries, but it's a reasonably priced and serviceable choice compared to hotels and B+Bs costing exponentially more. If all you want is a clean and comfortable place to sleep after a day of sightseeing or other activities, this is a good choice.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808513b5b27d7ad5:0xfdfc96bb4c9e8804</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The microwave and fridge were a welcome plus. Being on the first floor with the ice machine was very convenient. Breakfast left quite a bit to be desired. It was not of the same quality as our room. There was a couple checking in ahead of me who were having a rough time of it, so I had to wait and wait. The person behind the desk was very helpful with them and very apologetic to me about the long wait. My only other complaint was that check-in time was 4:00. We were way past ready to have a place to get out of the truck and lean back and relax. Sure wish check-in time could have been earlier. We called to see if we could get an earlier check-in time, but no such luck. We had to wait until 4:00!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rating>

<review>The hotel was comfortable and affordable.  The hotel had interior door entrances and exterior(outdoor) room entrances on the same floor.  To get to your room, you may walk from an interior hallway, to an exterior hallway, only to enter another interior(indoor) hallway.  The design seemed unnecessary for clients to be exposed to the elements and only creates a space for people who want to smoke outdoors where the smoke lingers into the rooms adjacent to that space.<//review>< pictures>

Stayed here a few times for work for three days each, first time had ants in room had to notify staff twice to get them. Something in the room was making me sick as I woke up several times each night with stuffed sinuses and coughing up a storm unsure if it is just that room since I always wind up in the same room (208) but coworker got sick as well on the first stay.< /review>

<Text>Older place with some upgrades. The free breakfast is about what you expect with some extras, reheated eggs and sausage. There is rust all over and repairs are at odd angles like hobo patches. The bed is old but had an add-on pillow top. The elevator sometimes works and the pool is not inviting. Despite all that, rooms were clean and people seemed nice.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Better than I thought it would be, everything felt clean (even the carpet), the bed was super comfy. Only reason that I'm giving a 4 is bc it's not a full service hotel, and the walls are "thin". Breakfast is good, staff is SUPER nice and as accommodating as can be. I'd stay again< /review>

For the price I think it's decent as long as you're only staying there to sleep and shower.  The cleanliness is a little questionable to me but I've stayed at worse places.   There's a microwave and small fridge in the room which is a plus if you have leftovers and takeouts.  Stayed here with my sisters when we did a Napa Valley and Sonoma visit and the place is a good 30 to 40 minute driving distance to both.   Breakfast is included and basic stuff such as cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, eggs and sausages.  There's also a waffle station. After 4 breakfast though you'd get sick of it. There's are lots of fast food within walking distance if you're into that and also a gas station with a convenience store for basic needs.  Overall, it's a decent experience and price especially now that Air bnbs in the wine region is getting ridiculously pricey.</Text>

<review>All the staff members we encountered were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were smaller than expected, but clean. Breakfast was wonderful; We really liked the extra hour and the staff kept it stocked. My son was happy that the pool was heated. We were a little disappointed that the ice machine was broken when we were there, but we understand that machines do sometimes break. Overall, we may stay here again if we are in the area, but only if it is a short stay because of the room size.<//review>< Pics>

Comfort Inn in Fairfield is a very good value, providing a spacious, clean, comfortable room. There is also a decent sized pool. If I am back in the area, I will definitely choose this hotel. It can be reached off of two freeways (80 and 680), and there was no freeway noise in my room. I enjoyed the breakfast.< /Text>

The hotel is an older one but the rooms are very clean, the breakfast was delicious, and the service super. We do wish that the pool had been heated with more than the "sunshine" but we did take one "polar bear plunge". My compliments to the Supervisor of the front desk and to all the staff working there. Felt like HOME.<//review>

<Review>This hotel is a nice stop over if traveling to SFO or if just staying a night or 2 for the local entities. Budweiser, Jelly Belly, Ect. The staff is very nice and helpful. The pool and gym appeared to be closed for some reason, but in the summer time, I think it would be open even though it should have been open at that time.
Overall, nice hotel, breakfast and I would recommend it.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The hotel is fine considering I was there for work and only sleeping and showering at the hotel.  I didn't actually spend a lot of time in the room.  The hotel is definitely in need of a renovation, but I would stay there again if in the Napa area.< /review>

<review>Hotel was in great location, price was great for value, bathroom was "repaired" but repaired areas did not match original paint, very tacky and patchy looking.

I love the staff very nice, the rooms are a little out dated.   Old school air conditioners of which some are broken as in to look at but they work.  I always get stuffed up when I run the air I am assuming that is due to the old filters in the air conditioners.  There are no extras like movies,or room service yet they ask for $100 deposit....for what??  makes no sense and I can't afford that every time I stay and then have to wait weeks to have the money put back onto my card.  I almost don't want to stay there anymore because of this.</Text>

<Review>We stayed at this hotel because of the great service I have historically received at Comfort Inns. Our check in experience went very smoothly. Jazz was very upbeat, competent and friendly. The bed was a king size. It was clean and neat but I noticed that the bed skirt had a huge dark stain on it. Nasty. Also the elevators and hallways looked really worn out. After dinner we went back to our room to prepare for bed. That's when things went south. There were kids toddlers and older running back and forth screaming, laughing and slamming doors from around 6:30pm to 10:50pm. . When that didn't work I called the front desk. After 3 attempts with no answer I gave up. I was so angry. The next morning we ate breakfast which was surprisingly good. All we could think about from there was getting on the road.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x808513b5b27d7ad5:0xfdfc96bb4c9e8804<//Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< userid>

Clean, quiet, accommodating staff, and nice breakfast choices. Laundry facilities were a plus for us. Our grandsons loved the pool, but the bottom was very rough on their feet. We ended up
buying water socks for them.</text>

<text>Although I requested an interior, quiet room, we were given an exterior room just above the pool area.  Tried to ignore the screaming children on the first day, but then on the second day there was a contractor working in the room above ours, boombox thumping and blaring.  Got moved into an interior room after complaining, but no help with luggage/moving.  Internet service was intermittent in both rooms and resulted in a data overage on both our phones.  Breakfast is good if you avoid the scrambled egg patties which are tough and nasty tasting.  This hotel will not be my "Choice" when we come back to the area next year.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>I have stayed at this hotel over the last 10 years or so when I am in the area. Every time I stay there the service is always excellent and the staff is so caring. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who might be traveling to the Fairfield area. They always remember me when I call in or show up at the hotel. That is so refreshing. I travel alot and stay in hotels an average of 70-75 nights a year.<//Review>< pictures>

Disappointed In the khols store terrible customer service..i had just hit a jackpot wanted to spend at leastv1000 i walked out with nothing because when i asked about perfume and makeup i was shunned on which hey they dont need me as a customer they have plenty so that was frustrating.
Not all khols are this way< /review>

< Review>
The Wall of China restaurant was yummy! Great food. The staff was very sweet and super helpful explaining the different dishes.
We were very impressed with our service. Huge portions! Next time we're in the area and wanting Chinese food we'll definitely be coming back. Prices were reasonable for what you received.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I actually visited the cigarette store and the Dollar Tree and I enjoyed both experiences cigarette store has such a variety of whatever you need from vaping too much jewelry and their prices are fair and that helped us friendly and they stay open late I like that they stay open till 9 then I went to the Dollar Tree and they had such a variety of things that was amazing and it was only a dollar not 99 Cents Store and More it was the Dollar Tree everything was $1 and I got a righty of nail polishes and dog treats all kinds of stuff so I would highly recommend it staff there usually it is pretty decent and they're fast and efficient definitely recommend both places< /review>< pics>

It's a nice shopping center... with the exception of the dress store, I think they need to put some kind of entertainment for kids there... This place has nothing for kids to do, especially for birthdays, they have the option between two different parks, they need a chuck e cheese or The Jungle or even the trampoline place...<//text>

Im from out of town so im not very familiar with this shopping center i did see that they have a variety of shops and places to grab a meal I did go to Jack in the box like at 1 something in the morning after a night out at the casino whoever was working through drive thru and the person/people making the food were awesome because they prepared our food exactly how we wanted we had ordered 5 different orders with 6 tacos some with sauce and some without sauce  burgers with cheese and no cheese and reg fries and curly fries great job guys<//text>

The stores are good and relevant, but the buildings are in need of maintenance and repair. The landscaping is always well kept, but there shrubs that block your view of vehicles coming through the center lane. You have to creep out to see if someone's coming.<//Text>

The landscaping is always well kept, but there shrubs that block your view of vehicles coming through the center lane.

Not good, an argument started inside between an older man and a large younger male they were told to leave and the continued right outside the door. We asked the manager to call 911 since it was getting physical and all she did was call the junction security and 2 very old bent over old volunteers showed up. Will not be going back</Review>

Close to Hwy 108 and Hess Ave, Got most things people need.  Taco Bell and Burger King across the street, five different places to eat in the center, varied type food, Starbucks.  Bank, grocery, CVS, Kohls, Dollar store and a few others.  Plenty of parking.<//review>

The junction is a place I visit often. Price Co foods is a decently priced grocery store that is convenient as it is close to home. The cigarette store is in the far corner. Wells Fargo is my bank, located right next to Starbucks. Then of course CVS for medicine, all kinds of things I tend to need while I'm there & who doesn't need to stop in at the Dollar store? I do! Famous footwear wear, Kohl's & TJMaxx are also visited frequently. I would rather hit up the junction for my shopping needs as it is so much more convenient, faster & friendlier than a trip to Walmart. Doesn't matter if I only need 1 item on my way home or a whole list of things, the junction is the place I stop. The junction also has other stores I didn't mention like a jewelry store,Jack in the box, Togo's, subway, a place to get nails done BBVA bank & a few more< /review>
