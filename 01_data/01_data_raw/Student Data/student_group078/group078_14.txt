Very well organised and accessible restaurant. They serve large portions and for affordable rates. We liked the meals a lot and the staff members were very amiable and chatty. Recommended.</text>

Why are people saying great things and leaving 3 stars???? I’d give this place extra stars if I could. Tucked behind some vines hanging off the buildings edge, a short walk through the front to a fabulously designed interior with low lighting and comfy seats. Owned by a cultured, global traveled couple who make you feel welcomed and well fed. The food was amazing, the lamb slid right off the bone, the seafood was perfectly seasoned, OH! And the Moroccan mint tea was a crazy wonderful experience in itself. Best first experience with Moroccan food. Thank you, thank you. Will be back soon.<//Review>

< Review>
This place is wack! The food was super salty, the pita they gave me was hard, my meal was not complete with what it should have come with, the salad looked and tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave it was nasty soggy. The reason why I am even giving them 2 stars is because the hummus was good and the garlic sauce was good as well. The guy that gave me the food was not wearing a mask and was not very nice. Our office will not be ordering food from here ever again.<//Review>

Don’t let the lack of a sign or the fact that it’s connected to a gas station scare you away. This place is amazing. Their plain rice will blow your mind, let alone a whole dish. Desserts are fire too. Get at it</Text>

Probably my favorite restaurant in the Burbank area. The food is consistently excellent, and the desserts and coffee are equally good. My personal favorites are the chicken kebab plate and the chicken wrap. A great spot for a full meal or even just coffee and dessert. Highly recommend.</Text>

<Text>I was hanging out with a couple of good friends of mine, we were craving some good hookah, tired of frequenting the same lounge. We were in the area and found this spot in a humble corner of Glendale. We decided to try it out and had a great time, orange head, mint infused flavor, great music. Check this place out, no regrets here. Have fun!</Text><name>Braysone Huntery</name>< user>

Went for the first time and was absolutely blown away! The food is amazing; I had the boneless (white) chicken plate and my girlfriend had the filet mignon plate and it was drool worthy! The side of fries is perfection and the garlic spread is the best I've had. New favorite spot.< /Review>

Best place around the area and we've tried several. My son and I have become frequent visitors here. If it's your first time you can start with the beef and lamb wrap and try other dishes from there. I promise it'll hit the spot.<//review>

I love this place. I've been to several locations and the food is consistently tasty and the customer service is excellent too. The Spicy Doner and street cart fries are my go to items. I highly recommend this place for takeout during these times, as they also offer items that you may need in your home such as hand sanitizer and eggs. I can't wait to dine in soon.<//Review>

** AVOID ONLINE ORDERING AND/OR DELIVERY **

Marsa Lounge took 2 hours (from the time I submitted my order) to deliver my food. I ordered around 3:40 PM, a time that one can safely assume is NOT busy for restaurants (which google analytics supports in showing this sparsely frequented time as "usually not busy"), and was told by their online ordering system that I could expect delivery "around 4:30 PM Today". After 45 minutes passed the delivery ETA, I called the restaurant to ask about my order that was nearly an hour late. All I was told was "sorry, the delivery guy already left". I still didn't receive my order until around 5:40 PM, about 2 hours after I submitted the order.

This is absurd because the restaurant is about an 11 minute drive (a little over 3 miles) from the address ordered from. How can it possibly take 2 hours to prepare and deliver a 3 item order? It would've been faster to take the bus there, order take out, and then take the bus back. Or, rather, it would've been faster and cheaper to go to the grocery store and cook myself something to eat.

Needless to say, the food was barely warm when it arrived, which checks out as it was likely sitting out for a great deal of time before it was actually out in transit for delivery.

Marsa Lounge should consider either revamping their online order & delivery process to accurately represent delivery ETAs or discontinue offering delivery & online ordering altogether until they are equipped to professionally handle these.

As for the food itself, it wasn't bad. I had not eaten in almost 12 hours so pretty much anything tastes good at that point. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was because the food was edible and somewhat tasty.

My only other complaint is that the hummus is overpriced, as it is at many restaurants, seeing as it's so much cheaper to make at home. Anyone with a food processor and a brain could make homemade hummus.</text>

Amazing middle eastern food! True authentic flavors and dishes. Baba's sampler is great to start off with especially if you have a group. Mixed grill plate is beyond perfection. Stop reading and go now!Keep an eye on the closing gap during the day</Text>

Tbh this became one of my new favorite spots on the Mission just after my first visit. Their feta pie reminded me of the ones my mom makes, and the dessert remind me of my trips to Turkey and the Middle East. Definitely 10/10 on authentic-ness and creativity. Also the owner makes you feel so incredible welcomed - as if you were old friends. Super surprised at how much I enjoyed my visit. Highly recommend checking them out. Will be visiting again next time I'm around.< /Text>

I had contacted Mohamed about an event we were holding in Malibu for 40 people.  We wanted it to be a little nicer, and Mohamed was EXTREMELY helpful and accommodating.  He offered to provide beautiful chafing dishes for all the food he provided, at no additional cost!  The food delivery arrived right on time and the driver set everything up right away without me having to take my attention away from the event.  The food was a huge hit with multiple guests coming up to me and asking the name of the caterer.  Mohamed truly went above and beyond and I would use his services again and highly recommend Marsa Lounge for anyone who needs quality and reliable catering.<//Review>

We went for the show, and it was so fun!!! All of the performances were awesome, but we specifically love the acrobatics during dessert. I will say that the Pre Fixe is SUPER over priced for the amount of food and type of food, but it was tasty. I would recommend for any special occasions.</Review>

A hit and a miss according to me. First the misses: 1) Bakalava was exceptionally sweet. 2) The falafel was dry and really hard to even bite into. My friends who used forks and knives had their falafels flying around. 3) They have the worst music I have heard in a restaurant, by far. Loud rap music is not the ideal background while eating kebabs. The hit: 1) The lamb chop and the shrimp kebab were out of this world.< /text>

My husband is from Tunisia...and my MIL is like a MasterChef, so my expectations are very high. But this place was good. The slata mechouia and hummus was very tasty. I had chicken shawarma and my husband had the lamb couscous. Both good meals. And the other all pricing was very fair. Better than the other Tunisian restaurants we tried while in LA for vacay.</text>

They just opened so I'll give them a break for my pickup order being late. The food is amazing and good portions for the price. The kebabs and chicken tajin were both juicy and packed with flavor. Will definitely be back!< /Review>

My go-to Marsa Mediterranean Cuisine never disappoints. Get the Lamb shawarma, add fries, tahiti and spicy sauce. The portions are huge, and the meat is juicy, you get the most bang for your buck here. Winner.< /Text>

<review>Tourists on a tight budget (but with an insider tip from my resident epicurean daughter, a germaphobe whose instincts I trust) we drove past this tiny hole-in-the-wall place at first. So glad we found parking and went in!! Amazing middle-eastern food, kabobs, falafel, lamb on a spit-- a favorite for locals, this is super reasonably-priced, deLicious food!!<//review>< pictures>

Nassar is awesome! The hookah is great and they're well known for their food as it is also a catering company. Sometimes their chicken is a little too salty. 5 stars because it's the closest hookah spot near Santa Monica that won't mf you in price!<//Review>

I am not reviewing the food since I have no idea if it's good or not.
I placed and order at this restaurant through Eat24 (Yelp owned food service) at 7:37 pm. The estimated arrival time was 8:09 pm. Shortly after 9 pm I tried three times to call the restaurant and the line was busy, subsequently I called again at 9:10 pm and the line rang and went to voicemail. I tried again numerous times over the proceeding 10 minutes.
In the midst of this I contacted Eat24 through their instant chat support and they attempted to make contact numerous times and failed, by 9:30 pm I was done and my kid and wife literally went to bed hungry.
At 9:55 pm the delivery arrived and I turned the driver away, at the point it had been 2 hrs 15 mins since the order had been placed.
No call, no apology, no response. Quite frankly I don't really care if their food is good or not, because everything else stinks, and Eat24 was also remorseless in Theo handling of the situation.< /text>

Great products; however, no customer service. Suits look great but at $800+, I'd expect a little help with sizing/matching. Waited in an almost empty store for 40 minutes and never got any assistance.</Review>

7E2-213: It is a great store with good quality and brand name products at good discounted prices.  You can always find some good deals here. Another great thing about this store is that it is next door to Nordstrom Rack which is also similar value store.</Text>

<text>For the longest time I wanted to check this location out. I have to say it was just kind of, "meh" for me. There is not a lot in the kids shoes. I just did not find those extreme sale items like I have online.
Last month I purchased a King size down alternative blanket for I kid you not $9.99. It left me hooked and looking for more. I was able to find a King size duvet set for almost $60 bucks. So conclusion, "meh".<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

No customer service. Tried to return online order in this store today... Not as easy as you would think it would be in 21st century. Even after I called their customer service line and  their own customer service rep asked the manager of this store to accept the return in the store she still didn't want to do that...  She argued with me and with their own customer service rep. Now I am waiting on shipping label from sacks 5th and having to mail it back. More worries for me, more shipping charges for sacks 5th... The customer service in this location truly saks !</review>

Their express checkout is actually slower than their normal checkout. Last time I went to get just one purchase of no-show socks and I was told to wait while they went to help someone. 10 minutes later I just ended up going to the main checkout.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Very clean, very organized. However, you do not really find many things on offer that are worthwhile. The prices are quite high even to be of the outlet type and you almost do not find anything that you like or that of the size you occupy.

Muy limpia, muy organizada. Sin embargo en realidad no encuentras muchas cosas en oferta que valgan la pena. Los precios están bastante altos aún para ser de tipo outlet y casi no encuentras nada que te guste o que de la talla que ocupas.<//Review>

We had a great experience.  We worked with Norm in deciding which 5th wheel to buy. At one point I decided not to proceed because of difficulty finding a new diesel truck.  I then returned after finding a different brand of truck that filled our needs. Norm was very understanding and no pressure at all.

After deciding we worked with Lou Galvin to review and sign the purchase documents. Lou sent me a day in advance of our appointment info I could review regarding various service contracts we might buy. Lou was great. He did an excellent job reviewing the contracts and all without any pressure.

Finally on the day of taking possession of our RV, AP showed us through the RV and patiently answered our many questions.  I’m sure it took much longer than they, or we, could have imagined. Again, AP did an excellent job of answering our questions and and showing us all the improvements since we purchased our earlier RV.

Thanks Norm and your employees.< /text>

I went in and Lou helped us out. Showed me what I asked and never got pushy. Made it very easy and comfortable. Couldn’t be happier with our value on trade in and our new upgraded RV! No hidden charges, made the deal and that's what was. Very pleased to do business with Norm’s RV.< /Text>

I had a great experience here. The reason I chose Norm’s was because I called around to multiple RV dealers in the area and he spent the most time explaining to me everything I wanted to know. The reat of them just wanted me to come in. I felt taken care of here. Lou also took great care of me when deciding on warranty and other coverages. Very happy I went to Norm’s.<//Review>

<Review>We just purchased a new 2020 Northwoods Arctic Fox 25Y travel trailer from Norms RV and it was a very pleasant no pressure experience.   We were treated very well and feel that we received a good deal on a quality product.  Everyone from Norm, Lou in finance and the service department were very friendly, courteous and knowledgeable.  I really appreciated the no pressure attitude when dealing with Lou.  A.P in service did an outstanding job in explaining the features and operation of our new trailer and Todd was very helpful in helping us pick out a few free additional accessories included with our deal.  And on another note, I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the sales office and the service department, including the service department restroom.  Even though we are all experiencing the affects of this current pandemic,  I felt very safe interacting with the entire staff at Norms RV and highly recommend you pay them a visit if your in the market for an RV.</Review><Date>1601533835452</Date>< Pictures>

Buying ab RV from Norm’s RV was easy and painless! I enjoyed working with Lou Galvin, he helped us out immensely! We did most of the paperwork over the phone and on the internet which save us a lot of time. The service department staff are also friendly and very helpful. Keep it up and thank y’all

<Review>Outstanding customer service, eduction, support and all around great team. Norm, Lou and Jose have been quick to respond to questions, patient with me as I learned about camper trailers, fair and honest and I couldn’t be happier. Our family talked about buying a trailer for many years and just never felt comfortable...until we met this team. I highly recommend connecting with them if you’re in the market or even thinking it over. Thank you Norm’s RV!< /Review>< userid>

< Review>
My wife and I began our search for our first trailer 3 weeks prior: With two young daughters we were looking for a full size trailer that was compact enough to easily tow with our current vehicles and would accommodate a family of four. We had visited several RV and trailer sales centers in the area and Norm's was the second place we visited, and we found two trailers on site that fit the bill but were encouraged to look around and be sure - Norm said he'd rather see us in the right trailer for us and we have a positive experience than just make a sale.

The way we were handled by Norm and Lou was great customer service; many years of experience and advice and you could tell when talking with them they we passionate about RV'ing and getting families enjoying the outdoors in a trailer that fit they're needs and desires -  they spent a good deal of time with us, and no pressure. A superior buying experience to all the other places we visited.

<text>Norm’s RV made our travel trailer purchase a very enjoyable experience. Norm was knowledgeable and responsive, and Lou did an excellent job handling the finances. I really appreciate their honesty and straight forward approach. We were offered fair market value for our trade, and there were no surprises during the entire process. I cannot recommend Norm’s enough if you are in the market for an RV.< /text>< pictures>

This place is amazing!

As a city slicker,  I had tons of questions for sales, service, and the walk-thru/orientation.  What I can say, is that the entire team answered my questions with patience and professionalism.  Everything went smoothly from talking to Norm and Kim about the purchase,  to working with Lou on the paperwork and details.  Lou was great at following up and quarterbacking everything - including the paperwork,  orientation, and the installation of my parts. The ENTIRE  service team was professional and helpful in choosing the right parts and necessities for my trailer.  Working with AP during the orientation was awesome! He is very detailed and knowledgeable.  He answered each question and assured we had the right response before moving forward. The installation of my hitch and other parts were done professionally with no shortcuts taken.

Without a doubt, I would recommend this place to my family and friends.  Overall great experience and I can only assume the same care will be provided if I had any future service needs.< /Text>

<Review>We wanted to express our exceptional experience purchasing our Forest River Sonoma travel trailer with both Norm and Lou. The sales purchase process with Lou made it very easy and straight forward, he was very informative and made us feel very comfortable going over the purchase agreement paperwork.  Also, we would like to thank Norm too, for his time showing us options to fit our needs. His knowledge, experience and non-pressure approach was helpful to us on our selection.  Thank you again Norm and Lou for a most positive experience.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Norm and his crew did a great job of informing us about all the features of the Arctic Fox truck camper, and different purchase options available. There was no hype or sales pressure, and Norm was able to answer our questions sincerely. His service staff laid out options on battery upgrades and were very knowledgeable about the pricing of each option. My wife and I felt like we had been treated fairly during price negotiations, and look forward to doing future business with Norm.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>I chose Norm’s RV Sales to manage a consignment sale of my High End used Motorhome. I couldn’t be more pleased with my choice and the results. Norm’s managed all aspects of the sale in a competent and professional manner. They ensured potential buyers were qualified to complete the transaction, and not merely looky loos! I highly recommend Norm’s for all aspects of RV purchase/ownership!</review>< pictures>

<Review>Lou is very helpful and informative.  Their Prices seem competitive and there's a great selection.  We enjoyed our experience looking at trailers and despite the fact that we were not looking to spend a ton, Lou spent a lot of time with us.  They were respectful and walked us through the process and everything involved.  We would refer them!</Review>< Resp>

<Text>We came to Norm’s RV in Poway as newbies to the RV world. We had been looking at various RV dealers in San Diego and Riverside counties.  Lou showed us a used trailer we were interested in and was patient in answering our questions while we checked some of the appliances.  One advantage of a smaller outfit is that they kept the batteries in the trailer so we could operate the slide, check the lighting and DC status panel.  Some of the larger dealerships have so many trailers that they can’t afford to do this.  We were able to operate the Murphy bed and look at most of the storage.  They offered a certified pre-owned program underwritten by a “Route 66” network of dealers which will give us a 66 day warranty. This should be enough time to evaluate all of the appliances and make repairs if needed.  Norm’s also has a parts and service center.  There we met Danny who will set up our new hitch and will put the trailer through a full demonstration of the systems.  Then they will take us on a test drive to instruct us on some of the basics of towing a travel trailer.  So far we have had a positive experience, and I’ll update this post after we get through today’s activities.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

This is the second travel trailer we have purchased from Norm’s RV. We like doing business with Norm’s because the level of expertise, service and quality is so much higher than at the mega-RV sales lots. I doubt there is anyone on the planet who knows more about RV’s than Norm. Lou was knowledgeable and helpful regarding warranties. Danny and the others at the service center are terrific! We are satisfied customers.< /review>

<Text>We saw the Travel trailer online at the website with straight forward honest pricing. My wife called and made an appointment with Lou for same day. Lou is great he took time to explain everything and answer our questions as we are new to RV'ing. Very excited to be able to do our orientation tomorrow and pick up our travel trailer.
Norm's RV does their 72 hour PDI testing ahead of time so you can get your RV sooner. Other dealers were so far behind they wanted two weeks to get the trailer ready.
We are truly grateful we found Norm's RV and Lou for our first RV purchase and they have a RV service center for maintenance.
If you're thinking about buying a RV or trading one in give Norm's a try and ask for Lou.</Text>< response>

I have had a great experience at Norms RV!  I didn’t feel pressured to purchase or upgrade and I got a wonderful deal! Everything was explained clearly, my questions were answered and I got some great tips about RVing in general. Everyone from the sales people, to the technicians, to the owner, Norm, were accessible, friendly, and helpful! I highly recommend visiting Norms RV if you are in the market for a quality RV at a good price.< /review>

Would definitely recommend Norm's RVs to my friends to buy and service RVs!

I had a great experience from start to finish. Lou was our sales rep and helped us look at every single RV that my wife and I wanted to look at. We settled on a Route 66 Certified used 5th wheel. The condition was "almost new" and the price felt right. We had to wait to buy due to the concerns of COVID, Lou was understanding of the delay. When the time came to finalize everything, we gave them short notice. Norm's team was spot on. Jose called the night before to confirm I had everything to safely tow the RV.

When I picked up the RV, I was given a through walk through. Any questions I had, the service and parts team was able to answer. My hitch was not the right height for the RV and the were able to adjust my hitch to get me on my way.

We shopped 5 different dealers in the San Diego area, and we were the most comfortable with Norms RV and we love friendliness and honesty.<//Review>

We worked with Norm and Lou to purchase our Evo trailer, Norm got us a great price on the trailer. We wanted a floor plan he doesn’t carry, he checked the manufacturer stock and got it for us in less than 7 days.
Lou handled all the paper work and trailer delivery. Overall we recommend Norm’s RV</Review>

<review>We called Norm’s RV about a camper and spoke with Lou Galvin. Lou was very responsive, answered all our questions, and described the camper honestly. When we arrived to inspect the camper, it was as represented. I can not tell you how appreciative we were about that. We were able to strike a deal based on the information and found no surprises.

Norm’s inspects their used campers before they go up for sale, fixes problems and discloses what they can not. Quite Refreshing.</review><Rating>5<//Rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<user_name>Nick Morita< /user_name><review>Norm's RV is the place to go to if you want an Arctic Fox RV. A small independent lot with a very knowledgeable and helpful staff. Their service center is a short distance away. Norm, the owner, is usually on site and always available. Lou provided a seamless financing experience and Carl and Todd handled the PDI and walk through. They both displayed a willingness to spend as much time as necessary to walk us through our new RV. Also, Carl pointed out many important "need to know" features about our particular unit. He knows their product line which is extremely important to us and he educated us about things and features that will help us to avoid many frustrating experiences in the future.  Thanks again to Norm and his staff.<//review>< GmapID>

We had a wonderful experience buying our 2020 FR Stealth EVO 1850 Travel Trailer at Norm's RV in Poway, CA. Lou helped us every step of the way with a professional and courteous approach. He never pressured us but made sure we considered exactly what are needs were before we purchased. He further helped us with great financing that beat the USAA pre-approval we had come in with. We also had a chance to meet the owner, Norm, who was great to talk with because of his vast knowledge of camping and travel trailers. Finally, both Lou and Norm respected "social distancing" and made us feel very comfortable the entire time. My sense is that this is just the beginning of many more positive encounters for us at Norm's RV.  Thank you Lou and Norm!</Review>

Here's what you need to know:  I went to Norm's RV Sales looking for general info--not ready to buy.  Norm walked around with me, showed me a coach and answered all my newbie questions.  He knew I wasn't going to buy and still took the time to talk to me and show me a coach.  If you want to be ignored or talked down to--go to a big lot with 20 sales associates.  If you want to be seen and heard and respected--go to Norm's RV Sales!</Text>

We live in Poway and just happened to check in at Norms RV. We saw a Georgetown coach and fell in love. Working with Lou and Norm was a great experience and we ended up with our 2nd home. We highly recommend working with them and we loved keeping it local.lou thank you some much for you help and keeping us.posted on all that was happening during the purchase process.<//Review>

My husband and I were looking to purchase a used Arctic Fox 5th wheel. We saw an add in the rv trader for a 27-5L at Norm’s RV. We met with Norm and he showed us the ins and outs of the 5th wheel. Norm is very knowledgeable and the coach was very clean. We decided to finance our purchase. After filling out a short application Norm hooked us up with Lou, the Finance Manager. Lou had all the paperwork done in a short time. He is polite, very professional and a  pleasure to work with.
All in all our experience at Norm’s RV was easy and enjoyable . Thanks Norm!</review>

My wife and I had an amazing experience purchasing our first travel trailer from Norm's RV. Lou, our sales rep took great care of us. His no nonsense, low pressure approach came with exceptional customer service. I felt like I was dealing with a genuinely good guy who cares and not just a salesman. No Bull. In addition, Norm's expertise from his many years in the business were an incredible resource for any in depth questions we had. If you're looking for a a dealer that is family owned / operated and delivers the things you value in such a business and at the same time sells you a quality product at a very competitive price with no headache, Norm's RV is the place! We are super happy with our new Forrest River Sonoma!!! Thanks Lou!!</text>

I have never been more impressed than I was when having a walk-through with Norm on a brand new Artic Fox 5th wheel. No sales person has known as much as he did. No owner has ever ordered what a person would need to have a very practical coach, and put the unit through the tests needed to have safe travels with little or no break-downs as Norms does. I really wish I had met him before.

I would have saved a lot of time and research time going to Norm's first. The Artic Fox is known for its quality then Norm puts the frosting on the cake by ordering the options that are needed by the camper.

Please, if you do anything, go here first and save time and money getting the honest facts right up front.<//Review>

< review>
I posted details of the used travel trailer I was interested in purchasing to several local RV dealers.  Tom Charlebois at Norm's RV contacted me to let me know they had a rig I might be interested in, and I arranged to view the unit.

While looking at the used trailer, Tom mentioned that they had a new trailer I might be interested in. My wife and I made an appointment to view the new trailer, and it was a great match for what we were looking for.  Tom never pressured us to make a move till we were ready, which we appreciated.

Once we were ready, Tom handed us over to Lou  Galvin, the finance manager.  Lou went over the warranty details, and descibed the additional products we might be interested in.  Again, no pressure to buy what we didn't feel we needed.

Overall, we had a very pleasureable experience, and look forward to years of happy camping.  Thanks Tom and Lou!</review>

Norm and his team just helped with the sale of my Class C motor home. Couldn’t be more happy with the experience from start to finish, from the friendly greeting when I first arrived, the professional marketing and timely sale. Norm’s communication was alway immediate even when he was out of town. I highly recommend Norm’s RV.<//Review>

We had a pleasant experience buying our travel trailer from Norm's. Spent about close to two months looking and visiting various places. By now we knew what we wanted and had experienced both decent and pushy/shady places.
Being a bit of a distance from us we ended up doing everything, on our NEW unit, mostly by phone and email and only came down for the final signing. George was able to make it happen both verbally and on paper followed by the big man himself, Norm, who did the final signing.
Overall i think they run a pretty neat and friendly operation. They will show you their product but are respectful of your wishes.
The service department is at a different location, but it's only a few streets away. The staff there is super friendly and lively.<//Text>

<review>I've purchased numerous RVs from Norm's and was happy with each one. It's the most trust worthy RV sales and service location I've ever been to. If I didn't live 500 miles away, it would be the only place I would take my RV. Unfortunately I haven't found a place like Norm's in the Bay Area yet. I'm planning on buying my next RV from Norm's.<//review>< Rating>

Web-site states warranty work done here. They said that there is "NO MONEY to be made by them on warranty work and to go else where because we did not buy it from them."     ????   I wish that they were not a part of Route 66 and Forest River. We are new to RVing and bought the best TT we could find which was a Forest River. Maybe the next brand I buy will be different to avoid issues. Fortunately, La Mesa RV gladly took the appointment.</Text>

Salesman was a real Richard!!  (read between the lines at what's short for Richard)
He was a white haired Guy.
We are retiring and stopped with 100 grand to spend - in cash.  We will be living in the RV full time for at least 2 years.
There was a used unit we fell in love with but wanted to see a few Class's A's and a travel trailer.
My husband has never owned an RV and I have and so it's important for him to see options as far as type we want.
We looked at 1 new and 1 used and a Class C and asked to see the 2 Class A's.
He REFUSED to show them to us and I mean downright refused!!!!
He said the one had a bunk house and the other was too small for what we wanted.
I thought that decision was ours, not his.
I told him we have 12 grandkids which we do so how did he know the bunks wouldn't work for us?  He said he wasn't there to just open trailers for us to look at.  HELLO!!!  Yes you are.
He said he had been doing this 17yrs and KNOWS he would show us and we wouldn't buy it.
So we just said we were leaving if he wasn't willing to show us.
He then followed us to our vehicle and kept telling us that he knew what we wanted and he had spent time showing ppl rv's HE knew were wrong. I said how do you know what we would like?  He jusy kept saying he knew a bunkhouse wasn't right for what we wanted. He had a 3-5 min conversation asking us and also never asked what size we wanted yet said a 27" was too small.
Then we got in car to leave and still didn't shut up and stood there telling us why he wouldn't show us the other 2.
We didn't know own what we wanted yet. We were even willing to increase our budget.
Some of our grands are still 3-4
years old so bunks would be perfect!!
We would live part time in San Diego and part time in MN where the other kids are.
My husband was soooo stoked on the used 5th wheel that chances are we may have bought that.
We have never been treated that way and will not go back.
I am telling all our friends who are retiring soon and Yelp and anyone else who will listen.
If this guy isn't the owner I sure hope the owner sees this.
I am still steaming!!!!
So much for keeping our business local!!
I left my glasses there and am so pissed I won't go back to get them.< /Text>

{'time': 1487727526609, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience here, on Yelp, and on our website.  It sounds like things didn't go the way either of us would have preferred.  For that I am sorry.  Unfortunately, chance encounters between two upstanding individuals don't always go as desired.  That is the nature of human interactions.  Complaints such as this are rare at our dealership in general and with this employee in particular.  But, like all the wonderful employees at Norm's RV, he was hired from the human race.  As a result, we strive for, but never achieve perfection.  We wish you the best of luck in your journey toward your future RV purchase and are more than willing to help if you wish to give us another try in the future.  Or, if you have additional concerns, please feel free to contact Norm directly.  Finally, we did locate your glasses in one of the RVs you looked at.  They are in the office if you or a friend would like to stop in and pick them up."}</Resp>

The guy with the white hair and dark beady eyes behind the counter was rather rude and condescending.  I would avoid this place.</review>

Tires are overpriced for cracked tires
Very old tires check The D.O.T before you purchase
Had a blow out the next day and still had to pay for another tire.
Also the way he treats his workers is awful
3$ per water bottle . Thats how much a full case cost at the store</Text>

<Review>Has a sign to plug tire if it's off car $5 to fix. Well they plugged my tire then after I paid them $5 they asked for $5 more. Saying they put the tire back on the car. Well no one asked them to and no where is it posted if fixed tire is put back on the car that would be an extra $5. To top it off the plug that was do to the tire came out after 7 days. SMDH! If I could give 0 stars I would.<//Review>< pictures>

I kind of stumbled on this place just by sheer coincidence, my car figuratively limped into this place after blowing out her tire about a block away. Great Staff, Tires are at a great prices, i bought a pair for 30 dollars, and they are still going strong. I highly recommend this place.<//review>

If I could give 0 stars I would! Went here to get a tire fix and left with a messed up rim! They didn’t have time to fix it that day after taking 2 hours to fix my tire so they told me to come back tommarow , when I went back the next day they argued about it and said they never did that to the rim. So , did nothing about it . Not to mention there costumer service sucks! Never will I come back to any of el Camino shops 👎👎👎</Review>

Had a flat, so went to El Camino and I purchased a used tire. A few days later I realized I had been sold a tire that had a hole in it, as the tire would not stay inflated. I returned to the shop to discover they sold me a tire with a nail embedded in it. The staff was rude, they informed me I should have checked their tire and saw the nail before I purchased it from them. I was informed I would not be provided a refund and they would not replace the tire. Beware!!!</Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) I give two stars because they deceive the customer there they have a clear sign that says price for patching chanta 5 and 8 mounted on the car and it is a lie they charged me 10 for a pga and I was not mounted and did not argue because I was going to work in a hurry to report it to the owner

(Original)
Le doy dos estrellas porque engañan al cliente ahí tienen claramente un letrero qué dice precio por parchar chanta 5 y 8 montada en el auto y es mentira me cobraron 10 por una ploga y no iba montada y no discuti porque iba de prisa al trabajo pienso reportarselo al dueño</Review>< Pictures>

Good choices for different combinations. The first time I went I had a delicious pastrami sandwich. The second time I had an Oldsmobile (sauteed mushrooms, onions, and melted cheese) very yummy. Also enjoyed a homemade brownie and a chocolate shake. The restaurant is clean and so is the restroom. The service is friendly. Great food and great experience.👍👍< /text>

<review>EXTREMELY clean environment. The food was delicious. The price was a little bit high considering what you get. All in all, it's a place I will be visiting again in the future with more people. I never thought of putting avocado on a hot dog but it was delicious!</review>< pics>

I admittedly walked in with low expectations, I mean it's a hot dog, what can you really do to stand out with them. I walked in and was immediately surprised by how large the menu was considering most of it was hot dogs. When the hot dog arrived, I knew I made the right choice. It was the best hot dog I had ever had. Service was excellent and the very friendly staff even went as far as to make sure we had napkins at the table. I'll definitely be coming back here a lot more.< /Review>

Place looks great and the people are awesome. Food taste was pretty good but for the price I paid was not worth the amount or size of food I received. I left hungry and went to go eat at another place right after. Would be great to see some combo meals or bigger dogz. Overall I probably won't be coming back but selection, staff, and venue is awesome. Glad I came in.<//text>

< Review>
Food is good, service is awkward and lack-luster.

I came here with my family on a busy weekend to find them understaffed. The hostess (I'm being generous with the term), was uninterested in taking orders and serving customers. At one point the cook was refilling drinks and helping clear customer lines.

We saw plenty of people walk away at the sight of the wait (which wasn't a lot of people), but mostly because the line was stagnant for long periods.

Additionally, a lot of the non-food items are of poor quality. The utensils, for example, may as well have been made of wet noodles.

I'm not sure what happened here, but I don't think I'll be returning.<//Review>

<Text>One of my new favorite places to grab dinner! So many options for hot dog toppings that you can't find anywhere else in the AV. Ghost pepper cheese, curry powder, grilled mushrooms, Jamaican relish, etc. The chili is delicious as well as the spud-ometers (seasoned tater tots)! The only downside to this place is that there's not much seating so it fills up fast. My husband and I usual order to go because of this.< /Text><rating>5</rating>< gmapID>

Overall the place was clean, staff was friendly. But I paid $17 and I got two hot dogs that were average sized, a coke and a thing of Texas two step fries. Everything was good and fresh but I left hungry. Gave a 3 star cause I felt for the price I paid it should have at least been a bigger hot dog</Text>

We try to make sure we cover those that crave more food and not more price.  (I'm one of them!)  ;)\n\nI recommend stopping by and trying our famous Hemi Hot Dog. It's a popular dog and we have received lots positive comments from many of our customers who have tried it. Plus you get any toppings on this dog so I am sure it will not disappoint.

An absolute gem in the a.v!!! 👍👍😁 came here with my wife had the 240z and Studebaker dogs, wow they were delicious. The place has an awesome atmosphere. The theme is masterfully executed, much praise. A nostalgic feel that you don't get anywhere else. Custumer service was great and menu has so much to choose from. Definately will be bringing my whole family and friends here !!!< /text>

<review>The hot dogs were tasty but pricey for the normal sized dogs, however the Hemi was totally worth the price! I love fried pickles but these were way over cooked and burnt! The jalapeño and onion straws were great!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Are you a hotdog person? If you are not, skip it. If you are like myself, and love hotdogs and chili, then hot rod dogz is a must! I highly recommend the Jamaica dog, it sounds odd, but tastes SO good. All the side are greasy, but not so much that it dominates the food. The fried pickles are amazing, the nacho chips are amazing. If you enjoy they style good, this should be a go to spot for you.</review>

This place is the bomb dignity.   They hook u up with samples to try out to see which flavor u in the mood for.  Im always seachin for a bomb hotdog place and this was right around the corner the whole time.  Good pricing and just about everything there is on point.  I hope this place dont ever shut down.< /Text>

It's not only tasty, but unlike other ice creams, it tasted organic and healthy.  I'd pay more for their ice cream quality and I'd come here everyday if I could.  I'll be back!< /Text>< Pictures>

Long line because of customization. Ordered pistachio. No nuts ..ugh. Kind of seems like generic base with the flavor you want. Pricey besides. Creamery in Walnut Creek way better.<//Review>

It was a good experience! They were sort of helpful trying to explain some of the flavors, but without samples it's definitely hard to know for yourself.. I played it safe with the 'Milk & Cookies' and I loved it!</Text>

It's cool to see the liquid nitrogen, but the place is very expensive. The smallest size costs nearly $5, medium is nearly $7, and toppings are $0.75 each. Organic or non-dairy options also cost more. There are a lot of flavor options, which is nice.</text>

I appreciate that they have organic and coconut milk but they refuse to mix flavors for the ice cream. Having your cream flash frozen on the spot is a novel idea but I would avoid this place unless you want to wait half an hour for a cup of ice cream.< /Text>

By far the best ice cream and experience ive ever had for a desert. Freshly made to order ice cream, granitas, and more. Lots of selections, a fresh clean vibe and very busy on the weekends.

I would recommend coming here every time you get a chance over a cold stone's.<//text>

Cheater, Don't accept their mistake, Bad customer service.
Ordered large (Supreme) size and they served in medium (Deluxe) size. Employee arguing that it was same quantity served is different size. Really :-(

Horrible service. Opened 25 minutes late followed by non-chalant uncaring and questionable-hygiene by the two workers. Place itself is nice but cannot run well without supervision.</text>

Cheater, Don't accept their mistake, Bad customer service.
Ordered large (Supreme) size and they served in medium (Deluxe) size. Employee arguing that it was same quantity served is different size. Really :-(
As per them, customer is wrong.< /Review>

<Text>By far the best ice cream and experience ive ever had for a desert. Freshly made to order ice cream, granitas, and more. Lots of selections, a fresh clean vibe and very busy on the weekends.

I would recommend coming here every time you get a chance over a cold stone's.< /Text>< Pics>

We all scream for ice cream :) nice place to go with family. Staff was friendly and patient explaining to my 8 years old how the nitrogen works in the process of making those yummy ice creams<//text>

<review>Horrible service. Opened 25 minutes late followed by non-chalant uncaring and questionable-hygiene by the two workers. Place itself is nice but cannot run well without supervision.</review>< pics>

Fun ice cream made while you wait with liquid nitrogen. The creamy base is really good.< /Review>

Wow, the ice cream here is so amazing. They use liquid nitrogen to make the ice cream right infront of you! Worth the high price tag.<//text>

Service has gotten terrible lately. Deeply understaffed on weekends, and employees seem dispirited. Too bad, though. I used to love this place.< /review>

I have been to the store twice and I really enjoy them I’ve bought multiple phones iPads I watches from them they’ve been kind and efficient and I’m very very happy with the store especially Mariana is very knowledgeable, kind, friendly and patient with my 80 year old mom, we usually ask for her. I have been helped by AJ the Manager who is very kind and patient. I live in Hemet and pass many other stores to come here, I will only due business at this store.<//Text>

Usually have Great customer experiences here, but a few weeks ago as I was getting out of my car in the parking lot there was white Honda with mountains of marijuana smoke coming out of the car. Sprint representative with messy beard and dirty pants got out of the vehicle and went directly into the store, went behind the counter and immediately started working. Representative seemed out of place and made me completely uncomfortable. I left before even walking in to the store!!!< /review>

<Text>Went in with a bunch of questions and most were answered honestly. I ended up keeping my service with sprint thanks to Sean. He was very patient helpful and listened to my concerns. I really appreciate his help and all the information he provided me with. I recommend this store if your looking to switch or are looking to get a new carrier with good prices and honest deals.</Text>< Rate>

Great service, hospitality and greet with great attitude. Come to this place to get your next phone. Chase, Mariana, dajasa and Daniel. Those are the people who give great service and will help with any concern you may have. I messed up my charger port for my Galaxy s10+ and Chase did his magic and fixed it. THANK YOU!!</text>

<Date>1474044556034</Date><Review>Called this store on 9/15/16 to inquire about preordering the iPhone 7 plus. They informed me that the preorders were pretty backed up and I should just come in on 9/16/16 at 8:30 to get in line and just pick up an in stock phone. So I took the day off, drove an hour to the store. There was no line, so I stood outside alone for 30 minutes and while I waited, went ahead and reset my phone (iPhone forever plan meaning I am leasing my phone) to speed up the process once I get in. At 8:55am a sprint associate comes out and asks me, "you're not waiting for an iPhone 7 are you? Cause we don't have any".< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><gmapID>0x80db693da7957ac1:0xefbbe1c16fe3005a</gmapID>< username>

<Review>I’m changing my pharmacy after how they just treated me and other customers. The ladies behind the pharmacy counter are terrible workers. They actively talked bad about customers with them in front of them, sharing personal information with other people not part of Walgreens staff/pharmacy, and not attending to customers while still actively talking bad about them. When you do get someone to help you after waiting ten minutes they will leave once again for another ten minutes without reason, then go back to talking bad about people. I have been going to this pharmacy for several months now hoping it’s get better but it hasn’t, and I don’t think it ever will with those employees.< /Review><user_name>The Original Pancake< /user_name>< response>

I buy alot from this store due to convenience.i quit using the pharmacy awhile ago.to many problems.Today i returned a elbow brace.The assistant manager Terilissa was .y cashier.I knew i shouldn't have wore a tank top.She was shrewd.She made the transaction without asking me if i wanted cash or return the money to my card.she just put it on someones card.its not on mine.She told me the money IS ON MY CARD.i was ok with it.Three hours later when i needed gas to take my kids places, i realized she never put the money back.then i realize the shrewdness, the whole thing was on purpose.i go to talk to her and she was slow to help.I was mad then.she tells me it takes 3 days to clear.16$ and this is there assistant manager??and she tells me if i wasn't acting upset things would be different.
Yes i have tattoos.but im a single father who os dedicated to my kids.i dont deserve being treated like that.i didnt take 3 days to pay them.< /text>

<Text>I had placed an online order and I opted to ship to store. When I got to the store, associate named Joe was stocking shelves and I asked him about my order. He falsely said all my items were put back on the shelf. He did not put my order number on the computer to verify. Joe was rude. When I asked if I would get a refund, Joe falsely said that I was never charged so there will be no refund. I looked at my bank account and I did see that my bank was charged for the order. I asked other employees for a manager. The other employee said the manager is “busy” and instead sent Joe to me. This time he says he will look into the computer. Only then I was able to get my package. This was such a waste of my time and very dissatisfying because Joe was so dismissive. The other employees were nice and helpful<//Text>< GmapID>

<Text>The lady at the pharmacy kept calling me "ma'am" despite the fact you can very clearly see my beard through my mask. Was not very happy about that. Also she just straight up wouldn't split my payment between two cards. Was told "it'll just drain the money from the first card" after asking. That's...that's not how debit cards work...I've worked retail before...I've also definitely had folks who work here split my payment between two cards before.

Every other experience here has been fine, this one in particular just really didn't sit well with me.<//Text><gmap_id>0x8082d870a762c14f:0x9f943a6996c3d47f<//gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><time>1601081866971< /time>< user_name>

<text>This review is regarding the management of the drive thru service.

I was directed to this Walgreens location for a COVID test.   Upon arriving the lines were long as expected.
After waiting quite some time got closer to the service window only to discover the COVID customer must be in the LEFT LANE.
The the only indication of this requirement is a small paper sign all the way up at the window area.

Management could have easily either put that sign at the entry point or added the information on the appointment email.

There was only one person working both lanes
(COVID testing and prescription pickups)
I know it’s a busy time and she was doing her best but management knew for months that this was coming and seems to have done close to nothing to gear up for the additional demand.

Disappointing.

Update...    They sent the promised email for the results.  But the link they sent does not open

Tried several times to log in and got an error message each time.  My laptop is a new Windows 10 PC fully up to date, so that was not the problem.
I guess their web designer forgot to test it.

In times like these greater care and oversight
really should be applied.</text><Resp>None</Resp>< pictures>

I've been going to this location for years and I must say the new manager Sidra has made tremendous improvement in the customer experience. The staff seems to care now. Wait time on phone and in pharmacy has improved a lot. I appreciate the staff for showing patience towards the rude customers.</review>

I like this place it’s close to my house but I have started driving an extra few miles to CVS because so many people loiter outside this Walgreens location. It’s really uncomfortable. Especially with a bank and New Earth next door, they should do a better job keeping the people asking for change off the sidewalk and parking lot.<//Text>

<Text>I live 20 miles from this pharmacy and received texts messages that my 2 prescriptions were ready, but upon arrival was told one could not be refilled until following day. NO courtesy call or new text to advise me. They have my address and know how far away I live. Only used them for 6 months and everytime the pharmacy staff acts arrogant and rude! What a waste of time they have caused me with NO APOLOGY!! Also, the parking lot is filled and rifled with homeless in the wee hours of the morning.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

A vast majority of many individuals will be quick to jump on with a negative comment.  Wouldn’t it be great if we all left a comment whether positive or otherwise.  It’s so sad how the negative rules over the pleasant positive experiences.

With that in mind, I went to this store on October 19th, 2019 and had a FABULOUS experience from the time of being checked in by a friendly professional technician & receiving my flu vaccine from the doctor, Wendy, & this outstanding service I received should NOT go unnoticed.  I’m grateful they are all professional, great doctor/patient interaction & the priority of being a patient here is one that merits KUDO’s.

Thank you & hats off to this Wal-green 24 hour Pharmacy.

<Review>It’s faster to drive to this Walgreens and wait in line than try and call this place.  Last time I called I was on hold for 45 minutes, the phone started ringing again but nobody ever picked up for a few minutes before it hung up on me. The next time, I went in to refill a very common prescription and they were out. They told me it would be ready by 11-11:30 the next day. I went in at noon to see if I could speed it up a bit because I was going out of town and I needed it the day before. They said they had it in stock but it would take 2 hours to process. I’m changing pharmacies.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x8082d870a762c14f:0x9f943a6996c3d47f< /Gmap_id></record>

Possibly the worst Walgreens I have been to. Seems like the staff purposely looses you on hold if you call  and if you have the misfortune of having to go into the store you will be greeted by an array of confused employees that couldn’t be more useless.</Review>

<review>I used to be cvs customer where I always had problems getting my medication. I needed a special medication for my health condition that I had been trying to get for weeks at cvs. Finally I went to walgreens. I spoke to pharmacy manager Sidra at walgreens and she got it for me right away. She personally called my insurance to get an override and ordered medication for me. She gave me an ETA of 2 days but i received call from her the next day letting me know that my prescription was ready to pick up. Thanks to her great care and professionalism. Highly recommend this place.<//review>< username>

Very poor experience. After flu shots annually for several years, and a lifetime shingle shot last year, using California's largest medical insurer for payment, I was informed on 31 that my insurance does not cover flu shots. I knew was incorrect. They refused to contact the insurer. Didn't seem to care. Then a week later they call and say I can come for the shot. When I arrived they told me my insurance would not cover it but I could pay our of pocket. Paying out of pocket can be done at any time, 24 hours any day. They seemed not at all concerned that they had called me over for something that's always available.  They are not customer oriented at all.
I will take my business elsewhere.</Review>

I called the pharmacy because I had a question. The girl I talked to was rude, impatient, and not understanding. I have never been in the situation I described to her and she didnt try answer my question. I tried to say it in a variety of ways to get help. I have a language disability and she yelled at me for asking another question.<//Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>I have been a Walgreens East Ave pharmacy customer for more than 20 years. Today though I started the process of transferring my pharmacy records to KindCare.  Walgreens is a complete sh*t show and he's been for about six months. OMG, there is always a line of at least six cars outside.  Last week, realizing I was probably going to change pharmacies I purposely stayed in line to get an accurate Wait time. I was in line 37 minutes before it was my turn.  Inside it's like watching  3 Stooges reruns. Nobody knows what they're doing!  And the salespeople (pharm techs?) look like they were picked up on the street corner!
I will continue to go to Walgreens for everything else but meds as the floor sales people are much more on the ball.  Especially like my dark hair, dark eyed cosmetics gal.

<Text>It doesn't matter if you drive-in or walk-up or telephone.........  YOU WAIT.... AND WAIT....AND WAIT.... Extremely POOR Service.
Only one reliable and dependable employees in the Pharmacy, an elderly Hispanic lady that can't work hard or fast enough to make up for everyone else....
Perhaps it's the manager or upper management, But they know we have to wait to get our prescriptions.
Time for me to change.
So Sad....what potential they had there.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>My regular experience at this Walgreens is pleasant, timely and professional. Colin the Head Pharmacist is outstanding. There is one second shift young pharmacist that makes personal calls and hides out sight. This guy should be selling drugs in the parking lot... If you work with the animated systems or online this place rocks. Other than the one moron you have an excellent crew.

Steve from the pharmacy was supposed to call me back on Friday, I called Monday and got the same guy who pretended not to know me. He didn’t call me back because he didn’t want to tell me that they rejected my insurance and were going to charge me $290 for a single dose of medicine. I received a garbage service from this pharmacy and will never use Walgreens again.< /review>

<Text>Probably the worst Walgreens I’ve ever been to. The pharmacy takes ages in drive through or inside. The check out lines are always slow as well. They either have 8 people or 2 people working in the pharmacy at any time but either way it’s going to take you a year to get your prescriptions.< /Text>< rating>

I will be changing fallacies today after being with Wallgreens for 20 years. If a pharmacy person had JUST RXPLAINED IN A HUMAN  VOICE why the twenty minute line wasn't moving, if still be a customer. However standing in line for over twenty minutes with NO EXPLENATION, OR RECOGNITION, pissed us ALL OFF.  When I started talking, somebody called for help over the intercom. This has happened to me one too many time with this company, sorry to say, today we part ways; I won't miss you, you'll be glad I'm gone, all signs of TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.</Text><user>107502793395814006712<//user><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

Every time I've gone there I have received misinformation on whether or not the prescription is in stock, whether it's covered, etc. The length of time you wait for a prescription to be filled is absurd. They don't seem to have any processes orprocedures in place for filling prescriptions in a timely manner. The only reason they get my business occasionally is they are the only 24 hr. pharmacy in town; otherwise I would never give them my business. They don't seem to care anyway!< /review><date>1436207040201</date></record></dataset><record>

If they are going to make you wait half an hour to get an RX if you are at the drive through, the least they could do is not ignore you.</review>

They deserve (-) negative stars!  DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT GO HERE!!! for a prescription.  The pharmacy is HORRIBLE !!! My wife is pregnant and needs special prescriptions due to complications.  After being in the hospital we dropped off her RX  and they said it would take 2.5 hours to fill.  This is much longer than most other places in town.  When we arrived they said it would be another hour so we left and came back.  They still weren't ready and said five more minutes so I waited 15 and once again they still weren't ready.  We ended up waiting 5 HOURS for her prescription to be filled!!!  DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT GO HERE!!!</text>

The WORST pharmacy I've ever been to. They are always low staffed and yet they stand around talking and laughing ignoring the customers.when they talk to you they are usually extremely rude. You can wait 3-4 hours to get a prescription. I would give zero starts if it was an option.< /Text>

i have never ever seen a place that treats it's employee's like this walgreens. i've witnessed a woman yell at the cahsier for something petty. i feel like the same woman is a racist so if she would be let go of that would be great. she treated me like i was below her and i will never go to this walgreens again because of her. everyone else is good at what they do.< /review>

I’ve had so many experiences where I go to pick up a  prescription and it’s not ready. I wish they would’ve told me in the first place that they needed more time.  They also are always running short of some common medicines like kids amoxicillin. It seems like they’re always behind the eight ball.<//Text>

<Text>I have been coming here for 3 years. I would never go anywhere else. These guys know what there doing. One time I came in with a shimmy in my truck and my guy seen what tire it was from across the parking lot. On top of that they are honest. Top notch crew. If I could give these guys 100 stars I would. I can't thank them enough for always doing it right. We need more businesses like this in Hayward.< /Text></record>

<review>Well I have a Subaru Outback all wheel drive vehicle with 18" wheels.  I had a blow out while visiting relatives in Castro Valley Ca. No one even had 18" tires available for at least 2 days..... someone recommended calling them to see if they could help. They were able to get the tires in less than an hour and got me in as soon as I arrived. Thanks for everything Mission tire, you saved the day.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I needed to get all four of my tire pressure sensors replaced. I was quoted over $500 ELSEWHERE and called my girl friend to ask where she gets her car serviced. She recommended Mission Tire and I am so happy I went here. They were honest with their prices and services. I talked to Jonny the manager and agreed with his perspective on service and care. I will definitely be coming here again and start recommending this place for my car needs.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rating>

They did a great job on patching my tire, but destroyed the rubber wipers. It's impossible that both the rubber wipers were cut in half when I just used it the day before and it worked perfectly fine. No wonder these people wanted to change my rubber wipers, they know how to make money!</review>

<Text>Great work, quick service, knowledgeable staff, and affordable. I go here to do much of my work, namely wheel and tire mounting and balancing. In and out in less than an hour. They even mark wheels for the position on the car, ie. right front, left front. This is for the balance of the wheel and/or the wear of the tire (assuming they're used).

I've taken countless sets here for years and they've always taken care of me properly.</Text></record></dataset><record>

These guys are great, I've brought at least 6 cars over the last 2 years to these guys and they always take good care of me and the family cars. I have recommended these guys to my neighbors, my family, and friends. Good service, great selection of new and used tires, and very fair prices. Will definitely keep coming back.</review>

They did a great job, when in my situation, my mechanic did not want to do the work, they finished quick and walked through what was done. Support your local family businesses, avoid pep boys and go spend some time and money at Mission Tires. My car drives smoother and is safer on the road, so everybody wins.

I went to two Big O Tire locations and they tried to charge me a premium on my tires, I came to this place and they told me I only needed my tire patched. They showed me how to check and see if my tires need to be replaced, and I could see very clearly that my tires didn't need to be replaced for several months. They patched my tire for $25 when Big O Tires told me that my tire was not fixable, it saved me a ton of money and trouble and the service was excellent. Thank you so much Mission tires!<//text>

Just make sure if you have a security bolt on your wheel to take the key with you. I had to search for it but luckily had it. Very happy with the service. Highly recommend it.<//text>< pictures>

This place is friendly and efficient. I brought my own tires in for installation and am pleased with their services. They are a small family owned tire shop but get the job done right. Edgar is the owner’s nephew and helped me with my tires. He is very professional and kept his promise to his customers. I also noticed they sell used tires for customers who are on a budget. They charge a lot less than other nearby competitors and yet delivery outstanding quality service.  Definitely I am very pleased with their services and would recommend anyone to go there. Thanks Mission Tire!!< /text>

They offer super quick service, and I appreciated their honesty when it came to work needing to be done and work that could wait.

I also appreciated their competitive rates on new tires, and that they offered to find matching sets of used tires. Thank you for your service mission tire, you're a great asset to the city of Hayward.<//text>

<Review>Mission Tire has continually helped me out with great and quick service. Rates for replacement tires (new/old) are very reasonable, esp for how quickly they get you in and out of the door. I've only used their tire repair and/or replacement service but it's been what I've needed to keep my car moving time and time again.</Review>< user>

I dropped in around 4:30 pm needing newer tires for my car. There were a few other clients in the waiting area, so I assumed they wouldn't have time to help me. They quoted me a very reasonable price for a lightly used set of tires and we moved along with things.
I paid, and drove away around 5:15 with an excellent set of tires. Just in time for a hail/rain storm and trip back to Oakland on 880N. I luckily picked a very reputable, family owned, business that set me up to get home safely. They weren't cheap, but they were very inexpensive. He never tried to upsell me on anything. I also left with a very very reasonable quote on my brakes, which are in dire need of replacement.

Perfect score 5/7 would recommend to anyone near south Hayward.</Text>

They are a rip off. They tell you one thing n you go back to get the work done, they try to swindle more money out of a person. And I believe with all of my heart it because I am a African American Woman.< /Review>

<Review>Love going to this place. Do you have a nail in your tire, that almost every other tire shop says you need to purchase some $3-400 tire for? No worries, just go to Mission Tire and they'll probably be able to patch it, and for only $25 dollars. So unless your tire is bald and in need of replacement, which this place has some great deals on tires as well, then make sure you check with them to see if they can patch it for you!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I came here by recommendation, and it was definitely worth it. The parking lot and waiting area is small, but that was no worry since their service was quick. I needed to replace all four tires and I knew it was going to be expensive. Luckily they had used tires in stock and also just happened to have two different sets of tires for my car. The used tires look just as good as new tires, with almost the same amount of tread. Also the price I was quoted was the total price at the end, no hidden fees or mark ups. This business has my business.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>I was referred by my car dealer to get new tires from this phony place. They told me it was going to take them 20 mins for installing new tires. 20 min pass by, still not done. I went out to check to see what's going on, it was still sitting there jacked up. 2 hours after, it was done.  I checked my car all around before letting them bring it in for service. When I got my car back, there was a scratch on it. I confronted the customer representative about it, he simply replied, "we didn't do it," without even consulting it with his coworkers! Seem fishy to me. Bad experience here, I should've trusted my instincts and went with America's Tires. Be aware of this place, thumbs down👎 I will never recommend coming here.<//Review>< response>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>Found a nail in my tired and heard this place was good, fast, and affordable. Pulled in, let them know what was wrong, and they said it would be done within an hour. It was done within the time frame while I had lunch at La vics down the street and once I went back it was done within 15 minutes of my return. A few days later my hubcap for the fixed wheel was gone, and so I called them and asked if it was in their workshop. It wasn't, but they confirmed my phone number from the file they had and let me know if anything popped up and sounded genuinely concerned that it was gone. While it sucks I don't have a hubcap anymore, they were so gracious about my inquiry it wouldn't stop me from going here again for my next tire service need. Good people.</review>< time>

Replaced 2 tires for me and gave me a free brake inspection. They were very friendly and  patient with all my questions. When I need my brakes replaced I will be going back to them.  They have a small waiting area and had hot coffee available.</Text>

We got a flat tire on the way to Yosemite. They had our tire and suggested we replace another one (which we knew we should have replaced before). They were professional, courteous, and quick! We will be driving over here from now on.<//Review>

They are rude and always suggest to replace flat tyre with buying used tyre from them instead of repairing it on one pretext or the other.It happened third time with me for  different cars of mine. Will never go there in future.< /text>

<text>My grandson had just received a new PS4 for his birthday. He immediately put in a small disk from a different platform. It was stuck and we couldn’t use it.

We walked into the store and were greeted immediately. We left it in his capable hands and in two hours it was back in our hands.

He was professional and friendly and sweet. I highly recommend this repair shop.< /text>< gmap_id>

Easy drop off and very helpful.  The work was very professional and good quality work.  Attitude was awesome....only reason I’m not giving an excellent as the item was not ready as quoted.  Went in to pick it up on Thursday as quoted to do and they said they were so backed up and won’t be ready until the following Monday.  We were able to get it on the Monday and the console works perfectly.  So all is well that ends well.  I will definitely use their services again.  Just plan foe the unexpected on time....(I’m sure that Covid and kids home all day played a huge roll in their being swamped with work)</review>

This team is top notch I’m not taking my devices for repair anywhere else - I learned my lesson the hard way and got scammed recently. Repair all is the best and if you want quality service I would use them.</Review>

Easy and fast. Dropped off my phone. 25 minutes later they called my wife’s phone. Go in, pay and leave. And you get a $10 coupon for next time. Great service.< /text>

My first experience was when I bought my granddaughters iPad that got crushed in the recliner couch. I brought it there and they fixed it!  That was incredible!
Recently I brought my iPad because I could not get it to turn on. I tried all the things that are suggested on YouTube , nothing worked. They fixed it ! I won’t go to any other place but here!</review>

Honest and friendly. So, really my husband has taken his phones there for a long time. I just took my laptops in, and they were really honest about and knowledgeable about the issues. Felt really comfortable dealing with them. And as busy as they are in this time, they kept in touch with me about the progress just like they said they would. Yep, no complaints at all. I will go back again.

I spoke with a guy, sorry can’t remember his name but I know he was from a different store but just filing in for the day. He answered all my questions on the phone without ever sounding like I was bothering or interrupting him. I even called back a second time and even then he answered and gave me a great timeline on the work. Upon showing up he followed up on all promises and truly made this a great experience, because of him I will always come back to this store.

Jordan was so helpful. He was very proactive in giving me options to save money to have my phone repaired. I felt like he really cared for his customers and the quality of his work. I was so glad that he had the front and back screen replacements available. He was able to fix my phone right away!</Review>

Took my daughters laptop there to replace a cracked screen. Jordan was very helpful and knowledgeable. Kept me posted on the progress and gave me useful tips on anti virus. New screen was greatly installed, looked and worked perfect!!  Cost of labor was very reasonable. Will take all my electronics there so Jordan and Bryan can work their magic!!<//Text>

Jordan was fantastic. Got the screen of my S10 fixed in about an hour. He was super nice and professional. Hopefully I don't have any issues with my phone but if I do, I'll be coming here.<//review>

<review>I came in after making an appointment online. Sadly the website made an appointment for right when they were closing, but the staff stayed and fixed the problem with my phone anyway. I can’t tell you how much I appreciated that. They went far above my expectations and will return with all my future phone problems.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate>< pictures>

Bryan was very knowledgeable and helpful.  I needed a new battery in my Samsung and decided to get a new screen saver.  He directed me to the best one for my phone and use even though it was less expensive than the others they had.   He also gave me a great discount.  I will certainly come back for my cell phone needs in the future.</Review>

I was traveling yesterday and noticed my phone charger was not functioning and my phone was almost dead AND MOST IMPORTANTLY I WAS DEPENDING ON GPS TO GET ME TO MY DESTINATION ON AN UNFAMILIAR ROUTE!  I saw a large retail complex at the next freeway off ramp in Tracy and took the exit in hopes of finding a car charger.  All the businesses had very large signs over their doorways to quickly identify coffee; food; massage; exercise; REPAIR CELLPHONES; Laptops; etc!  Incredible offerings at  this location.  Huge parking lot directly across from storefronts: easy access and adequate parking.  When I entered REPAIR ALL I was greeted immediately and asked how they could be of assistance.  The gentlemen viewed my phone and dying charger and led me to the display area offering a number of replacement options.  We went over price and features and he offered me a bundle price for cord and car plug!  Checkout was efficient and I was in my vehicle in less than ten minutes with my phone charging and GPS guiding me.  Excellent location off the 205 Highway; very knowledgeable and courteous technician; I would definitely shop here again when in the area.< /Text>

<Text>We are a regular customer of RepairAll at Tracy (am sure that's not a thing to be proud of considering the number of times we have broken our phone :)).
The experience as always was good. The representative explained the services to us and delivered to our satisfaction.
Thank you. Would recommend them for any of your phone repair and accessory needs.<//Text>< Pictures>

Fast & friendly & PRICED RIGHT!  The work was done right and the advice given was honest.  And it was done for the best price I could find for that particular job... What more can you ask for from a reputable vendor?  I cannot think of a single thing!  Can you?<//Text>

<name>Shannon Rogers<//name><review>My first time experience with RepairALL is not the best. I went in to have a new screen replaced on my iPhone X. The repair man was courteous and quick and replaced the screen with a new one quickly. He also applied a new Gadget Guard glass protector that I purchased with it. As soon as I walked out of the store the iphone kept turning out on its own. It did it 4 times in the span of 15 mins and while I was talking on the phone. I also put it on speaker and the other person on the other line couldn't hear me. I immediately went back. The guy replaced that screen with another one. It did it again. He then had to replace that screen with a 3rd screen that was of a different brand and that finally worked. However because he only had one Gadget Guard glass protector he had to replace the $40 one that I just paid for with a "cheaper" one and told me to come back the next day for the other one when they had more. The whole process took 4 hours, 3 screens and 2 glass protector. But at the very least the repair guy was nice and that would be the only reason I’m giving it 2 stars.</review><rate>2< /rate>< Time>

<review>My grandson had destroyed his iPhone and was in need of a quick repair. We stopped in the store and Alex attended to us immediately, after looking at the phone he stated that he could repair the phone and could have it done in less than 30 minutes.  Very quickly my grandson had his phone back working perfectly and more importantly his mom never found out. Great job Alex thank you<//review><Rating>5<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x8090180b5b0cb391:0x6b70e30878dc2e7b</Gmap_id><user_name>R Woody<//user_name><date>1560365920920< /date>< pictures>

<text>Did a "walk in" repair for my Galaxy
Note 8. Needed a battery replacement.
Bryan was super helpful, knowledgable, and efficient . Most repair stores I had inquired about only worked on IPhones so it was wonderful to find RepairALL.
In little less than an hour my phone was fixed and I was out the door. GREAT SERVICE, GREAT PRICE, GREAT FIND !!
I recommend Bryan at RepairALL for all your cell needs...Thank you Bryan< /text>< Pictures>

The young lady there was very courteous and helpful. The service was quick and easy and the price was reasonable. Very pleased with the experience. I’ll be back there for sure when I need some help. This last time I was there Troy was able to help us out. He was very helpful, he gave us a reasonable price for the repair and he repaired before the promised time. It’s definitely my go to place for all my cell phone needs. Thanks guys!! You guys are awesome!!</review>

I have AT&T my phone broke and they did even want to look at it. They just wanted to sell me another expensive phone. I went to repair All and Jordan fixed my phone in one hr as he promised.
Thank you 😊</review>

<text>Ramsey at 2451 Naglee Rd provided excellent service. My daughter’s phone screen was fixed quick and efficiently. He also made sure to apply any relevant promotional discounts to the repair and screen protector for additional cost savings.

I was very pleased with my experience. Called for information about repairing my iPhone 7 face was very polite on the phone explained everything thoroughly to me. I was on my way to a different place for my repairs but after speaking with the employee and I’m sorry I forgot his name I change my mind and headed over to this location. Said my phone would take about 45 minutes to repair waited for my repair   Surprisingly it was done in 10 minutes. Would definitely go back if I needed any other repairs. Hopefully I don’t LOL<//review>

Great service and very knowledgeable.  My daughter broke her iPhone 6 screen. Took the phone apart in front of us and showed us potential problems. If the battery was no good? If the screen  we’re still operable. Turns out everything works even better than it did before. Even gave me a code for $10 off my bill. Would highly recommend.< /Review>

The battery is not so good as I thought because it is still lowering fast. However, they offered e a new one after 3 days test.<//Text><userid>104624259439494170335<//userid>< resp>

< review>
This is one of the best customer service experiences that I've ever had!! I have 2 kids that love throwing phones and I've gone to at least 5 cell phone repair stores in the past. This place is by far way better then the rest. I've never been to a place with this much experience. My repair was fast and the staff were really friendly. I even got a free screen protector and case. The owner of this place has over 20 years experience with cell phones repairs. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. I WILL BE BACK THANKS SMARTPHONE REPAIR😊<//review>

Would give 0 stars if possible. During a weekend trip, we walked in to fix our Iphone 7 Plus, the screen was cracked (although everything still working). A new screen was put on there, so we picked up the phone about an hour later. At first it seemed fine, but after we got home the screen stopped working. We made a phone call and arranged that we could come back to have the faulty screen replaced again by a new one. Another 2 hour drive due to traffic, and about 1,5 hours back home. But alright, the idea of the service was nice. Screen was replaced again, not one day later it's still giving problems.
Guy at the counter was talking about other stores buying cheap screens from Amazon, I guess ALL shops are the same then?

We called again, but unless we go for another 4 hours drive we're not getting back any money. It's not just the drive, we have to give him back the screen and will get another faulty screen (or even none) in return.

What looked like great service, turned out in a horror experience. NEVER again will we have any of our phone fixed here. It's cost us long drives and just frustration.

<rate>5< /rate><review>It took me a while to find this listing for SmartPhone Repair (2451 Naglee Rd., Tracy, CA), but I looked it up because I experienced such outstanding customer service that I really wanted to share that with anyone needing cell phone service or repair.  Quick, friendly, reliable, and truly excellent work done on my wife's phone and then on mine.  I was just passing through Tracy and stopped at the Starbucks right near this shop and found them. So glad I did!  You will be too.  Even though I live 90 miles away, I will take my phone(s) to them if I ever need additional service.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Baha is amazing! He hooked me up with an amazing phone case, and a new tempered glass screen protector as the one I had for my phone was absolutely terrible. He is amazing and is the nicest person ever, definitely provides great customer service! Definitely check him out, I promise you won't regret it!<//Review>

I forgot his name, but the gentleman that helped me was super professional and really helped me out! I called around for other places' prices and everyone was charging far too much (I'm from LA and I know that it does not cost over $100 to repair a regular iPhone 7 screen), but this place was inexpensive and GOOD QUALITY! There are also great deals on screen protectors and cases!

I definitely recommend!</Text>

<Response>None</Response><Review>Sent a text explaining my problems with my Samsung Galaxy 8+.  Got a response inviting mecto bring the phone in for diagnosis. Ahmad was courteous and very professional. Diagnosed and explained what was wrong and he assured me he could fix my phone.  Shocked when he said he would be done in an hour. True to his word I was ready to go. My cracked screen, black dots on display, poor sound quality on bluetooth were all fixed.  My phone is like brand new and I could not be happier.  I purchased a glass screen protector and he installed it for me. I saved the $1000 for a new x10.  Absolutely recommend anyone to stop in if you have an issue with your cell phone.<//Review><rating>5< /rating><user_id>106650933326047165001</user_id>< time>

Super fast and friendly service . Great attention to detail , before fixing my iPhone screen , wanted to make sure if I was ok with the color in stock. Hopefully I won’t need to use the services again .. BUT if my iPhone screen shatters again I will definitely go back.<//Text>

Best customer service I have received at any repair shop! The repair time as fast and the quality is excellent! The manager Freddy walked me threw each step of the repair process and I was made sure that none of my personal data would be eliminated. I recommend this shop to anyone who needs theyre device fixed; the technicians know exactly what theyre doing! Thank you!</text>

I had called Alex thinking i had broken my screen after dropping it on the sidewalk.  So i drove from Livermore to Tracy to get my cell fixed thinking here is another expensive adventure....  Alex checks my cell and sz there is good news and bad.  Bad news you drove to Tracy...good news your screen protector shattered but you screen is perfect....  How honest can anyone be....i purchased a new protector and out the door.  He is the most considerate and honest person i know.  Alex you have my respect. Take your cell or tablet to Alex for trustworthy and great service< /Text>

What a great repair shop!  Went in with a broken glass and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  I've had my phone fixed at other places before and they always try to make money off me.  Beha and his staff was personable and looked out for my interest and made the proper recommendations.  My phone is like brand new now, I'm so happy! Not only are they the best price in town, they care about you.  I wouldn't go anywhere else!< /review>

The 2 gentlemen that were working on the day I came in were so polite and helpful. I stopped by the store to see if my phone could be fixed. They said yes and it be 3 to 5 business days.  I said ok. They called me the next day and said  the part was there. After 2 hours I had my phone back. Thanks guys.<//Text>

<review>Amazing place and service I've been to pretty much all the other phone repair shops in Tracy  and this place has by far been the best experience and most helpful. I even got a free case and the guy running the shop knows what he's doing.</review>< name>

Very professional and quick service.  We were running late and they offered to stay later to ensure we got our phone repaired on the same day.

I will definitely come back if I need another phone repair.</text>

This was my first visit to RepairAll. They did have to order one of my parts but it only took 2 days. She called when the parts came in Other places said I'm out of luck.  I watched as she took apart my phone, I wouldn't try this too many little parts.  I will be going back for all of my phone needs.  Thanks for AWESOME service. While I was there I also found out they repair game consoles and head phones other stuff.<//Review>

Troy did a great job repairing my broken iPhone screen. He was fast, efficient and very knowledgeable. He made me feel comfortable at RepairAll. I’ve had bad experiences at other repair shops in the past but Troy restored my confidence. He even gave me a great deal on a sceeen protector and phone case so I don’t break my phone again! I’ll be sending all my friends to RepairAll.< /text>

Tech forgot to use water resistant glue in their hurry to accommodate me, I believe.
Did not find this out until a little dip in the river , literally in and out, which 8+ is guaranteed to withstand. Mine didn't 😶😭....
When I went back to them the manager was more than happy to get me COMPLETELY satisfied. Thank you again for the great work and your professionalism.  Definately a growing company where the customers satisfaction comes first!< /Text>< Pictures>

I broke the glass and part of the LCD screen on my Galaxy Note 8. Their fix was a replacement of the entire display component. So they transferred the "guts" of my phone into a new, genuine Samsung certified display. The price less than half that of an entire new phone, so worth it! It's like having a brand new phone. It took them about an hour and a half to do the surgery, and the work speaks for itself really. If you don't have phone insurance, this is the next best thing.< /review>

Beha and berto took care of me after I was pushed around by other business people and left hanging. I DROVE OUT TO TRACY FROM HAYWARD FOR HIS EXCELLENT SERVICE. Not only did they order the part when they noticed they didnt have it, but they made sure to get the work done in a more than timely manner to ensure that i was able to get back to work the as soon as possible as I rely on my phone for my job. Total repair time: 2 1/2 hours! Excellent service and the employees are incredibly personable. WILL RETURN HERE!< /text>

<Review>Walked in with a problem that seemed to be almost impossible to fix but all I did was walk in show the worker the problem and he literally fixed it in under a minute......and guess what......FREE OF CHARGE. This store definetly deserves 5 stars. Even the local AT&T store near by recommeneded me to come to this store for my phone fixing needs. Store is also very clean. Totally would come back again, and so should you!< /Review><response>{'time': 1494995533312, 'text': "Hello Crowned Films,\n\nThank you for the generous and kind review. We like to consider our selves experts in impossible 😊 the word impossible broken up is I'm possible (fun fact)😉 usually when we can fix something in under 10 minutes without using parts we won't charge for it. I mean, why should we! This is just another attempt at us going the extra mile for our customers. We are proud to come highly recommended from all the wireless provides in Tracy. Att, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, Cricket, Boost, Best buy all unanimously support us daily.\nThank you for helping make us Tracy's number one desired repair destination for Smart phone's and Tablets. Until next time my friend ✌😀"}<//response><UserId.>109667733033572973425</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x8090180b5b0cb391:0x6b70e30878dc2e7b</Gmap_id><rating>5</rating>< username>

I dropped my phone in the water & broke my charging port. called for a estimate walked right in there was no wait & the man (i believe his name was Alex) was such a polite gentlemen he fixed my phone in 20 mins & i was short a few dollars and he gave me a discount. Would definately be back if something ever happens again. Wouod most definately reccommend to a friend!< /Review>

<name>Ashley Dryer< /name><time>1502383912254<//time><review>Baha is the best and I'm so glad I found him!! Long story short- I went to the beach a wave got my phone and my screen wasn't responding, but it had vibration, and display. Being a Verizon customer for over 10 years I thought if I took my phone to Click Away (Verizon authorized service center) they would be helpful in fixing my phone. Sure, they were helpful over the phone, but when I got in there they asked a bunch of questions about what happened, and then who my carrier was; when I said Verizon the helpfulness stopped right there and I automatically became a person they thought they could upgrade. I was even up front in telling them that there was no way whatsoever that I was going to upgrade- of course, they didn't listen. They asked me to leave my phone for the day so I went to work and came back after, just before they closed. When I got there the smart a$$ guy attempting to sell me an upgrade told me that there was no way to fix my phone, the water damage was bad, that everything has corroded and how the water was "traveling up golden freeways" in my phone and the more I moved the actual phone the more the water would travel and get to the motherboard and fry everything. I immediately felt insulted. "Golden freeways!?" And so what, a magical unicorn is going to deliver my phone??? When I told them I will never again buy a phone from Verizon because I did not want the bloat ware or ability to control my apps they looked at me like I was stupid and asked me what bloat ware I was talking about. I am no technology genius, but I'm also not stupid like the looks on their faces. After 30 minutes of arguing so I could have my phone back  they fail to return my sim card and told me I never gave it to them, then called me a liar when I told them it was outside of the phone, with the Sim card tray in the ziplock bag, and they still told me I never gave it to them. So not impressed. When I had to go back in there to get my replacement sim card, they were telling an older gentleman that they needed to charge him $100 to reinstall the apple software on his tablet and he would loose everything not backed up. I'm pretty sure this is called a hard reset, and the tablet can do it itself! $100 for a guy who's clearly in his late 70's and has limited income.... really??
The next morning I went to Smart Phone Repair and met Baha. He was SO polite in explaining how their water treatment program worked and most of all- that they would try to get it fixed and let me know an update. The whole initial process was 24 hours of treatment and evaluation. Baha was really informative when he called me back and extremely hopeful! The screen wasn't responding, but the rest of the phone was responding to testing. I agreed to order a new screen, and a couple days later everything was responding!!! Each step he explained what might be a concern and how  he would test it. Before i took my phone anywhere, I did a ton of research about how to fix it myself, the cost of the phone, parts, and everything that Baha quoted me was spot on to what I had researched for myself. That being said, Baha was more than fair and completely honest and upfront about everything! There have been a  few other things I have noticed since having my phone back on a "test run" and Baha has been very responsive in how we can fix these few small things! I am so happy with the service I have received from him! His knowledge, professionalism, and customer service skills are above and beyond anything I would have expected from a cell phone repair shop! He feels like a friend now! And one that I trust and respect. Try here first, you'll know you took it to the right place the first time!!<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Resp>{'time': 1495772783863, 'text': "Hello Jenica,\n\nThank you for 5 star review. YAY!!!! Hi 🖐  We love fixing water damaged devices. It's always extra special because most people don't think it's possible. We actually get at least one device a day with some type of liquid damage. Here are the DO and DON'T of water damage.\n\nDON'T - PANIC (This never helps)\n\nDON'T -TRY TO POWER IT ON ( This can cause permanent damage to the mother board)\n\nDON'T - TRY TO CHARGE IT (This can cause permanent damage to the mother board)\n\nDON'T - WAIT TO BRING IT IN FOR SERVICE (\nRust and corrosion start to build immediately)\n\nDON'T- PUT IT IN A ZIP BAG ( This builds moisture and causes further damage)\n\nDO- THE SOONER YOU BRING IT IN FOR SERVICE THE BETTER THE CHANCE OF A SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT\n\nSide Note-\n(PUTTING IT IN RICE)  This should only be done as your transporting the phone to get professional service. The starch helps dry the phone but will not stop the corrosion. We all know what happens when water touches metal. It starts to rust and cause corrosion. Remember DON'T TRY TO POWER ON YOUR DEVICE NO MATTER WHAT!"}<//Resp><gmapID>0x8090180b5b0cb391:0x6b70e30878dc2e7b<//gmapID></record>

This was my first time here and walked right in and was seated, I had a new full set put on that I honestly am so happy with them and done very quickly a well. My nails came out gorgeous I would give 5 stars except I think they are a little pricey. I paid $65 for full set and maybe that’s not to bad for the quality I guess. But I would recommend coming here and will be going back for a fill just hope not to much lol!< /Text>

<review>The inside is ran pretty smoothly although the receptionist is not professional at all. It’s was packed but they got to us fairly quickly, which I did like. They have a lot of artist and have a nice set up.
Now here’s where they went wrong. I have never had a set of nails not last me almost two weeks. Getting closer to end of the second week they usually start falling off, which I don’t mind after that long because I don’t like to get a soak and don’t like to get them filled, I get them redone from scratch every time. Well my first and last time visiting this here shop. Sweetie my nails were dope the first 3/4 days, compliments from everyone, then my thumb nail falls off like a Lee press on. No biggie I can go get it fixed, only before day 5 can get here for me to get that one fixed my pinkie and pointer finger falls off. Not cracked but came off my nail clean as if they took fake nails and just pressed them on top of mine. I had an event that 6th day and wasn’t able to find anyone as my family event was out of state. Imagine my embarrassment people telling me how gorgeous my nails are then noticing damn near a hand missing between the two. Smdh I came here because this is where my good friend frequented before she passed, but now I see why she would be upset because her nails would break off, I thought it was something she was doing, and it was she was going to the wrong nail shop.</review>< pics>

I went in for a full set. I just wanted something very basic and it cost $50. The lady was in a rush and my nails are crooked and she missed some spots to put acrylic. It's not even a week and I need a full.  I didn't get what I wanted and I needed them done right for my engagement photos. Now I have to go back before my shoot smh<//text>

I use to love this place, but they're in too much of a rush to do a good job on your nails. The way she applied the acrylic had my nails looking lumpy, bulky, and uneven. She was able to do the design I wanted well on most of my nails, but the other ones don't look good at all. I asked if she could buff the design out on the bad ones, so I could fix it myself at home. She refused. She gave me $5 off my $65 set, because she knows how terrible they came out, but I'm really disappointed she didn't want to just buff out the design, so I could fix it myself. Now I have to go home and basically redo my nails. It started out as a pleasant experience, but it wasn't worth the wait or $65 for the set I got . I'm really bummed and I feel robbed. Time to find a new shop ladies! This one ain't the spot anymore😔< /Text>

This nail place is horrible so unprofessional asked a simple question if they have been busy for a walk in and got hung up on I called back and asked why I got hung up on and she said I asked too many questions and that I can figure it out my self. She was so mad and so disappointing never coming here again and I suggest you do the same. Such a disappointment, this is not how you run a business!<//Text>

<Text>I got my nails done about 5 days ago and my cuticles still hurt from how my nails were taken care of... The lady also left my nails not filed smoothly so I had to file them later myself. Don’t recommend this place if you’re looking for comfort with your nails. It’s purely a just a cheap place to get nails that look good but will keep skin irritated.< /Text><user_name>karen alexan</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Overall quality is great.Waited about an hour after appointment time because I waited for one particular person(Julie?)You can't come to a nail shop and expect to be catered to 100% a lot of the reviews on here expect that and forget there are other people in the world.I see a lot of complaints about the employees attitudes, but you have to understand a lot of the people they have to deal with all day.Employees are human too. Anyways great job and I didnt see anything sketchy or dirty.I do mechanic work on the side so my nails and skin surround are always trashed they did an awesome job and a week later they still look great< /Review>

This is a very popular nail shop and is forever busy.  Making an appointment is good because you can request the nail tech of your choice however you you most likely won't be serviced at the time of your appointment...so be sure to have plenty of  patience...<//Review>

Oof, if I could give this place 0 stars, I would. It’s gone downhill the past couple years. The work is excellent every time, however it doesn’t make up for having to deal with the demons they call “receptionists.”
They’re extremely unprofessional, rude, and lack any sense of what customer service is. I can’t imagine where they found these girls, LOL! It’s honestly a JOKE. I was going to come in for a fill today, but after the receptionist was unable to give me an estimated wait time even after taking my name, I wasn’t impressed. The final straw for me though was a fight that broke out at the desk over who was “next” in line. Of course, the receptionist did little to quell the anger of the customers. So yeah, great nail techs, AWFUL customer service! Save yourself the time, do not come here.< /review>

You have to wait over 3 hours for a pedicure. And even with that, the receptionist will forget about you. It’s very unprofessional. I would recommend going somewhere else where they actually care about you.</review>

I've been going here for over 6 years. Ivy, Ruby, and Vicky are my go Tom's..Vicky is incredible for designer nails. the atmosphere had changed and I'm not a huge fan of the set up, and the hostess staff is incredibly unprofessional, prices have also risen.So don't go in expecting spa experience .But $60 for a unique full set that will easily last you a month I'd well worth while. I pay $25-$30 for a gel pedicure that I can easily strech 60 to 90 days.<//Text>

The prices are definitely convenient, although when I came here I was getting a new set of dip nails. This is how my nails looked after she removed my previous set and she mentioned this was normal when removing them. She tried to get me to spend more money by offering gel acrylics, I declined to get regular gel nails. The second lady cut my nails even shorter all the way to the bed. I mentioned that I wanted to speak the manager in charge before I paid but she blocked me from exiting the line and demanded I pay first. After, I spoke to the manager and showed her this picture she said the girls are suppose to soak my fingers in acetone before removing which the first lady did not do. She said sometimes they don’t do it because it takes to long and when I mentioned that I’m paying my money it doesn’t matter how long it takes I went proper service she refused to give me any sort of discount.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>I’ve been going to this place for years and I’ve brought them a lot of service from friends to Relatives. But this past month or two I’ve been very unhappy with their service and customer service. Most of the workers are very rude and the manager is rude as well every time I go to get my nails done I experience the manager getting into arguments with customers and saw her also try to fight a employee. So unprofessional and I’m very disappointed. Also I spent a good amount of money their and to have my nail polish chip the next day and completely peel off is unacceptable. I believe they use cheap products for gel nail polish. I only recommend powder colors at this point and designs. Due to all of this they will definitely be losing my service 👎🏻</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpATCVVURqVI-9cas97O2IsRzOGdKfDnlov1w-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEobIzdCCGQ1Mq6BgwtnhH0rOeWwmGrbHAS6B5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMX19d2XJIxPEUHeXk029DrIvcdKwxcvJ5-ZJ7V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

My first experience was cool, at first i was irritated due to being told by the first nail tech she couldn't turn my coffin nails into stilleto without getting a full set, so i decided to wait for the next opening which was a great replacement Ms Ruby!!! She did exactly what i wanted very very pleased, was then shocked by how a basic fill and gel nail was 38.00 dollars when I heard you could get a full set with full bling for cheaper then that, but whatever I will return😃</Text>

I love going to 3-D Nails.
We live about 30-35 minutes away.
The prices are great.
Thanks to the staff, I'm a happy camper.</text>

Prices increase at every visit to almost double of previous owner and all the skilled manicures have left :( . Current techs do not have the ability to recreate many of the samples and are rough and annoyed when asking for nail art.

<text>very rude as usual, i paid $35 for a GEL FILL and my nails have already started peeling. woman at the front desk tried to blame me for it (washing my hands too much) when they haven’t even been done a week. & of course wouldn’t redo them without me paying another $20 smfh..... they don’t care about satisfying the customer at all.<//text>< user>

Pros pretty good nail tech lady’s here and my looks for my nails always come out cute. Price rates vary for what u ask for gel of course an extra charge. If u want an apt your good you still might have to wait a bit but better than being a walk in can make apt from a week ahead.
Con SUPER PACKED 24/7 but I believe worth the wait<//text>

<Review>Things I liked
The girls at the front desk were nice and helpful and they do have a tone of design  options
I give this place a one star because I don't belive this place is worth the waiting time (i waited over an hr to be seen) the drive and the quality . You might have trouble communicating with your nails esthetician because most are not fluent in English (something I didn't really mind).  The one star is mostly because of the quality. I pay extra for gel so it can last longer and after 4 days the paint is already peeling off and cracking. I don't do any type of work to have my nails to get ruin this fast.<//Review><Response>None</Response><Name>erica spears<//Name></record>

HORRIBLE. I would only recommend IF you would like to walk in for a scheduled appointment and STILL wait for 3-4 hours. If you have time and want to wait THEN I definitely recommend. They made my nails waayyyy to thick. They also overcharge ;) !</Text>

<Text>I went twice by the referal of my sister. The first experience was awful with dealing with the receptionist. On her day off, she came in and was drunk and provoking confrontating agruments with customers. I thought I was going to end up fighting her. I tried to visit there again and was extremely annoyed with an older tech who did my nails. She didn't want to do them the way I asked. It appeared some of the techs were very talented, however, my experience with customer service isn't worth another visit. Now I continue the hunt for a clean and up to date salon. Any suggestions?< /Text>< pics>

I went to get my nails done last month. I had some diamonds put on. The tech charged me 75.00. I couldn’t believe it but I really wanted my nails fancy for vacation. I haven’t been to the shop in like a year. The same job that I had done, I normally paid 45.00 for at the same shop. I believe that they charge you base on the tech and if you are new. I seen my friend at church nails on Sunday. She has it done at 3D and she paid 35.00 with diamonds. These techs are acting as if when they over charge us, the money is going into their pockets. By the way, it’s new management. Stop paying so much. Go somewhere else. If they need more customers they will drop their prices.<//Text>

This place is so gross and nasty, they do not clean their tools, I witnessed the lady use the same tools on someone else’s feet, when I asked her to please get new tools she supposedly opened a new sealed set and a few days after I felt a lot of pain on my toe, I have pus coming out of my nail, this is unacceptable.
Do not come here, avoid it.
People are constantly fighting and yelling, it’s not worth it.</review>

<review>First time coming here and they did my acrylics beautifully! Especially for the price. I’d hope for them to be more sanitized though, and they did cut my fingers a bit. Other than that they do a good job with the nails itself. I was gonna give them a 4 but now that I look at my cuticle that they cut pretty bad I’ll give them a 3<//review><userid>110621350631356967289</userid>< rating>

<text>Price for full-set is unreal! Sometimes the nail technicians can be a bit unfriendly or come off as rude.

<Review>I like the way they do nails. The only thing I don't like is that there's roaches 😣 I went in this morning and I was getting my nails done and the roaches were crawling all over the area.
Don't get me wrong I mean summer is approaching buggies will start to come out... But in a nail shop!?
Makes me think is the stuff sanitized 😢?

The receptionist is so rude.
The workers are human .... But I work for my money and believe me I don't get attitude with people.</Review>< pics>

This place is horrible!! My wait was 40 min with a reservation, and my nails still came off two days after? Called to complain then the manger doesn't take phone calls like what is
That. I had "the best nail lady" and they still came out terrible. First she rude kept changing the price the cracked my nail in half and still got mad at me for wanting a new nail. I'm never coming back and suggest anyone else that wants nails not to go!!!!!!! I'm so mad I have somewhere to and have to pay someone else to fix< /text>

<review>The designs are cute and pretty. Everything else about this place is horrible. What is the point of making an appointment, if I have to wait 25mins++ after my appointment time. Wasted my lunch. On top of this, they don’t care to cater to natural nails. If you would like your natural nails done, you will sit in the far back at an uncomfortable table. The table is by a traffic area and you feel squished. Will not return to a place like this.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Not good. My nails were done fast but it is like a factory in the sense that your hearded in and out. At first it was great they did my nails fast by 3rd day 4 nails have broken or chipped and one completely fell off. I'd choose another more personable place less crowded and more people oriented.< /Review>

Super long wait times and they don't always allow you to make an appointment. The nails are good quality and great pricing. Lots of designs and colors available. Customer service could definitely improve, they know they have an endless supply of customers so they don't care if they're rude.<//text>

< Review>
Went my first time today. I'm from out of town and wish this place was closer! They had so many designs to look at and choose.  I showed the lady a picture  of what I wanted and she did exactly what I wanted! There was a wait even with an apt, but it just shows how good of a job they do by how busy they are! 10 stars if I could!</Review>

I wish I could give this place a 0 star!! First of all, I ask the lady who did my pedicure if they had the specific color in glow in the dark. She said she did so I proceeded to getting my toes done. Once I was finished, I went to Iris (the money hungry nail tech). She was explaining that they only have three glow in the dark colors. I then was confused on why the lady who did my feet didn't tell me before. I told her to forget it, but I wanted a clear tip, so she told me to soak them off. Number 1, it took almost 2 HOURS to soak my nails off, and number 2, the lady that was helping the process go faster took her behind on a lunch break. Once I was done soaking my nails off, Iris was doing another clients nails and was begging me to pay her. She then wanted to go on break to avoid doing my nails!! Then I eventually went to another nail tech and she said that she could do the design I asked Iris to do. She didn't have the stickers to even do the design I wanted so I ask for the manager. The manager was making up all types of lies and it pissed me off!!!! Then, had the audacity to say I asked to have my nails done for FREE!!! Then this nerdy, rude, money hungry, Asian boy named Sun decided that he wanted to keep asking for my card, like hold tf up!</Text>

Nice and cheap . gets really packed and when you get  there. There is a sign up sheet and they call your name. so, first come first serve. I recommend that before your nails are done you should ask how much your gping to pay because I realize that they don't have like a specific payment its like they charge how they feel they did so if you ask before it might be cheaper<//review>

Nothing impressive, not super clean, but not filthy. Gets the job done. No appointments, walk in only. It looks crazy busy, but the wait time is minimal. $40.00 for a standard spa pedi and a gel mani. 5.00 upcharge for gel, which is pretty standard.</Text>

My experience was horrible here. The lady who did my nails did them all thick and big. I don’t get to file them down but she couldn’t understand me. This is not even the worst part!!! After two weeks I took my nails off and notice 2 fingers had fungus on them. I never had that in my life !!! I’ve always went to the same nail shop for 3 years and never had a problem. I will never return to this place again!</text>

The shop does good nails but the customer service is AWEFUL! I literally had an appointment at 11 AM. Came in an hour early knowing that I wanted to soak my old set and get a pedicure. When it was time for my nails a walk in was sitting at the tech I requested so Christina (Tina) told me to get my feet done while I wait. Once done with feet the tech was finishing up at the same time at 11:50. I told Tina I was ready for her my nails as well and Tina decides she will have another walk in who’s been here since 9 to go next. When questing why, Tina said she rotates between appointments and walk ins. I explained that the walk in had just finished with the requested nail tech and that I would be the next appointment. She declined and told the 9 o’ clock walk in to take my spot. So now I’m waiting another hour while this walk in gets a full set. Very unprofessional and needs training on customer and a better appnt/walk in system. It’s not worth the time or your money. I suggest going somewhere else.</Text>

<text>What can I say...  When will women be able to go to a luxury safisticated nail salon & be treated with respect?  I haven't found a nail salon yet in this area that take their time & cater to the needs of women who simply want to be pampered for the day, as we add some colorful beauty to our nails & toes!💅<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I seriously LOVE this place!!!! I don't mind the wait because the artwork,fast work on your nails, and attention to detail is always on point. I'm super picky about artwork perfection and if that means to wait i don't mind being patient as long as the job gets done right! There's always a lot of people because of the same reason, they get the job done; if it weren't as packed it would show otherwise. You get to pick your own artwork, the techs are skilled and up to date on new trends, and i ALWAYS make an appointment. If you take your time seriously make an appointment instead of walking in, and go earlier during the week instead of on weekends. It makes your experience so much worth it. Big High five for this place , I've been coming here for years and have ALWAYS gotten a different tech but same awesome nail perfection results!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><UserId.>116025446758549705520<//UserId.>< Time>

<Text>As i sat down i explained that im allergic to acrylic, and needed gel nails. She said okay, then proceeded with acrylic. Used a dirty file and when I asked her to open a new one she refused and started talking to her co-worker and snickering. Nails look good, but 8 hours later and i have SO much fungus its oozing out from my nail beds. THEY GAVE ME FUNGUS.

DO NOT GO HERE!!! These people have been taken to court by customers in the past. I have had countless bad experiences here. I love the way they do nails don’t get me wrong but to deal with the unprofessionalism & rudeness just isn’t worth it. I had an appointment that I had to wait two hours for, once I was seen they couldn’t finish my nails because it was time to close . They told me to come back the next day and I did and still didn’t finish my nails even that day. I eventually ended up going somewhere else, And they still kept my money which I’m sure is what the lawsuits are about. I can’t tell you how angry I was considering the fact that I was going out of town and couldn’t afford to waste my time getting my nails done for two days. Seriously unbelievable! They do not appreciate their clients because they have so many. You are literally just a number. Never a relaxing personalized experience . They want you in and out. I hate giving my hard earned money to a company that could care less about the people who feed their families. I would go somewhere hands down.</Text>

<Text>This place usé to bé the place to go and have your nails done.   I haven't been here in a while but is worst than before. Ownership changed and not only their work quality worsen but their attitude got worse.   There are no prices set for anything each technician charges whatever amount they want and they tell you at the end.   Listening to the reception staff how they expressed about the clients and nickname them is not only unethical but even illegal.   I will file a formal complaint with the department of the consumer.   It is a shame.   I will not comeback here<//Text><GmapID>0x80c336baa1921d09:0x1c2741db5c2acb3d</GmapID>< resp>

I went in with an apointment as well as i brought 2 other people. They told me when i got there at 12 that it would be a 45 minute wait. So then at 1:38 i finally asked how much longer cause i expected to be next. Then they told me another 45minutes to an hour. I wait until 45 min later then the lady said our groups next. 30 minutes passes and 3OTHER people were sat down. INFRONT OF US. Then we called them out an they were very rude an unprofessional. They ruined my whole day. When they can just be upfront an honest an say its going to be a 3 hour wait. The workers are constanly rude. THEY JUST LOST 3 GOOD PAYING CUSTOMERS. Between us 3 we were going to spend nearly 400 here but now we will take out buisness to Magic Nails Rialto. Where they have good customer service/conversation and do a good job. DONT COME HERE IF YOU DONT WANNA BE TREATED UNFAIRLY.</Text>

Terrible customer service. My first and only time there, they took 5 people before me even though they walked in too. When I asked why I was told because I was only getting a gel manicure and not acrylic nails so they went first. But if I wanted to get acrylic's they would take me now. When I replied that I would go somewhere else the receptionist replied with " have a nice day".  This is how new clients are treated???? I will never return!</Text>

<Text>very rude staff, and still using a paper system for appointments and walk ins, so receptionists ALWAYS lose track of who is next. and the manager, i asked to get 2 $10 gift cards (because my family did the bring 10 $10 gift cards thing for christmas) so i asked for 2 and she said “NO! twenty dollar nothing here!” i was shocked. we don’t go there anymore. we go to helen’s in victorville on amargosa now.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Too packed! I like to feel relaxed going to a nail salon. This place is too hectic, people waiting everywhere, sitting outside waiting! Receptionist was rude to me. I called and scheduled an appointment just for a fill the night before. I still had to wait over 40 minutes to be seen for my appointment. I had to wait in the sun outside, along with SEVERAL other girls. No complementary water or anything. I don't understand what's the point of making an appointment if you still have to wait 45 minutes. I left & went somewhere else<//Text>< Pictures>

I've been coming here for 4 years & it's under new ownership. The quality isn't as good anymore & the place is sometimes a bit dirty. Customers, who've been coming here longer than me, no longer come here because they now get overcharge for very minimal work. The nails still look good most of the time. I feel bad because I really love this place, they used to be the best nail salon I've ever gone to, but sadly they've kind of gone downhill.< /review>

Great price for what you get but it comes with horrible customer service and a long wait. You make appointments and still have to wait up to 1 hr and a half to get seated depending on the receptionists and how many walk ins they take ahead of you. I have witnessed a fight between a client and receptionist that happened over the nail tech not wanting to repaint a clients toe nail because according to them she should have gotten gel nail polish. Here the customer is NEVER right and   because they are so busy they don't mind loosing cuatomers or being rude. It is literrally a sweat shop in there. Not all nail techs are rude and they do nice work but just know it comes with the price or long waits and bad service< /Text>

<Text>Tbh this place is a grab bag in terms of quality. If you get the right tech you will get amazing nails for a cheap price, but not all techs are the right techs unfourtunately. If you want to get reliable and good work, make an appointment at a non busy time, you'll be able to choose which tech you want (I personally recommend #2) and you'll be out of there quick. Try your hardest to go just after opening if you want them to give you the best effort, this place gets packed really quickly and is known for having 1hr+ waits.</Text>< Pictures>

This place is hit or miss! My first time was awesome Ruby did exactly what I wanted pink and white powder ombre, they were beautiful. I went back today for a new set I got Tara , she did what I asked just like the picture I showed her so no compaints on that. What i am going to complain about is the mess she left on my nails. Thick spots under my nails and she cut me several times. First she almost ripped my pinky nail off while taking my old set off, it bled pretty good. Then she filed so rough on two of my nails she cut me on both fingers as well as the one from the dremel on another finger. The fact that she charged me full price was ridiculous. But what ever. My advice is stick to whoever's you know does good nails. I'll ask for Ruby every time now.</Text>

<Text>This place has really gone down hill. I used to love going here back in 2013ish and the last few times have been awful! I will never go back. The wait for a walk in was 3 hours. THREE HOURS. The people who made appointments were waiting about half an hour after their appointment time as well. All I got was a pedicure and it was terrible. She cut deep into my cuticles, the water was super hot, and the design came out ugly. I got one of the design examples they had and the girl couldn't do the design so she completely changed it without asking me! Then, if that wasn't enough, the toes didn't match. When I told her they were not the same (one design went horizontal on the left foot and across the top on the right) she took it off and did it wrong AGAIN. The whole ordeal took forever and it the end result wasn't even what I wanted. Don't waste your time here. It's not worth the cheaper prices anymore.< /Text>< userid>

<text>Well we were recommended this place. The receptionist was rude, the place is like an Asian sweatshop with strong nose burning smell. The lady didn't explain very well to my daughter what they had or could do. If we didn't ask her to clarify 3 times what they had who knows what wed get.< /text>< pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><review>I'd leave half a star or no star IF possible. This was my first time ever looking to get my nails done, I made my appt a day ahead. I explained it was my first time and was made to feel stupid for not speaking nail lingo. I was there within my 15 minute window. When I arrived the girls at the front were a little prudish and seemed more interested in their conversation than checking me in. I was told to "wait a FEW minutes" and was quickly dismissed. My appt was scheduled for 1pm and I arrived at 1:10 due to getting lost. I stood outside in the heat for for 45 MINUTES. No one bothered to let me know that their appointments were running behind and the place was packed like a sweat shop. After being ignored for 45 minutes, I abruptly left and found Lee Ann's Nails in the same shopping center. She seated me immediately, was very kind and made my first nail experience as comfortable as possible. My nails came out perfect and absolutely beautiful! I would STRONGLY recommend going to Lee Ann's unless you enjoy long wait times and rude customer service.<//review>< resp>

<Text>Me & my sister had an appointment and we still had to wait an hour. I had asked for long nails & they came out short i told her to fix them and she did not care to fix them. They are extremely bulking and she left acrylic all on the sides of my nails. She cut me pinkie with the nail filer when i told her to remove the acrylic from one side. I don’t recommend this place it’s expensive for a job thats not even well done in my personal experience.< /Text>< pictures>

The first time i didn’t pay any mind to it bc it was my first time ever getting fungus but this is the second time it’s obviously their tools!! i go to blue diamond all the time and never had a problem with getting fungus! i tried to show the manager and she said she wasn’t gonna argue with me and refused to give me a refund. i will never go back ! she even admitted to me that the pedicures there are possible to get fungus bc they reuse the same tools for every customer< /text><Resp>None</Resp><Pics>None<//Pics><date>1526751646185< /date><username>leslie leon</username>< rating>

Very rude customer service & never answer the phones. when the girl who does answer the phone, she is very unprofessional. Some techs rush on your nails so they break in 3 days also they change stations so much you don’t know who or what station to avoid. Never going back , I Tried a different salon in Rancho that does the exact same thing they do ( I love Nails ) & I’ll never go back to 3D<//text>

I got acrylic/gel and got them cut super short, plain color yet got charged $28 dollars. When my friend went a couple days ago she got acrylic dipp long nails & only paid $23 dollars.
They told me they didn’t do dipp nails there when i went.
They also charged my friend $40 for medium length magnetic color ?
lady said it would be $10 for magnetic because it was more “luxurious” ? it just didn’t make sense to me.

Rudest salon ever! Total disappointment this overrated establishment even gets business. They have no dignity at all! Can't provide service, can't keep appointment time, but they will provide a disaster for your child onb their birthday! Don't screw yourself, go elsewhere! 3F Nails is more like it!<//Review>

<review>Worst customer service.. The staff doesn't even have coustersy to talk politely to the customer. The gel polish peeled off the same day and I couldnt get it fixed as I was out of town. When I called to get it fixed they said they cant as they had 3 day policy.. The manager refused to come and talk on the phone. The person on the phone is very very arrogant and hung up when I was still talking. This is horrible experience and I no one should go through this.</review><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

Went there for the first time with a friend, the place was super packed, but I loved the outcome of my pedicure....until the next day, two of my toes were swollen and within the next week I had pus and blood leaking from my toes. Went to the doctor and was told it was a bacteria infection from unsanitary equipment. Check out photos!!!</review>

<text>been there only twice and both times the nail artists have been rude and given me attitude the last one was shaking from being so upset only because i asked her nicely to fix a smudge caused by the girl next to us cleaning up. i spoke to the manager and all she did was say "sorry" seems like she just wanted me to shut up and didn't care.  they do however have the most awesomest designs they do great work but they really need to work on their people skills.  the wait is a long one even though they have like 20 artists and they are decently fast.  it seems they don't really appreciate their customers since they have so many they figure whats one less.  not sure ill be going back.</text><UserId.>118175901534103600913< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

The girls who check you in the morning are rude and you almost have to beg for their attention. And then for the first time in a year the lady that did my nails said she couldn't fit all the little designs on my nails which doesn't make sense since everyone else has been able to make my nails just like the ones on display. She practically took out all of the main ones that I liked and even charged me full price even though she didn't even give me the design that I wanted. Other than that everything and everyone else are awesome. I get compliments all the time.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c336baa1921d09:0x1c2741db5c2acb3d</gmap_id></record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>I have been going to 3D nails for four years. And it saddens me so deeply to say that the new owners don’t take care of the salon. The prices are too high and not worth the thirty-forty minute commute from where I live. I used to pay $45 at most for a full set, all blinged out, now I’m paying up to $80-85! The nail techs are so rude and they do a very sloppy quick job. I payed $77 on my last set just for all of my diamonds to fall off within a week. Trust me when I say, it is not worth it!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c336baa1921d09:0x1c2741db5c2acb3d< /Gmap_id><date>1521441462618</date><userid>102348859922293548699<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<review>I think out of the many times I've been here, I havent had to wait very long with an appointment (20min max). Today I went (12pm appoint) and was out and dry by 12:45 and at my desk at work by 1pm. Maybe its because I come during off days like any day except Fri, Sat & Sun. They do good work for good price. If you dont want to wait I recommend to go on an off day, be early and keep asking the receptionist if you've been called, they have so many people to look after. Atmosphere is chaotic, its a nail shop, is not a spa. The nail techs are informative and fast. They have the latest techniques and what you pay for what you get is great!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Unprofessional and rude. Talk about others in chinese language while sitting in front of them. Refused to fix nails THEY messed up. Come in with a picture and walk out with something totally different. All they do is rush. Never going back again. Waste of money.<//Review>

They make you pay before the job is done. I would think before coming here. We had to pay before the job was done.< /text>

The prices are great but the customer service is horrid , some of the nail tech are rude. And when u have an appointment u still have to wait thirty minutes doesn't make sense.but when u get the ones that aren't rude and really make sure there clients get what they want. U could never get them unless u wait hours.  For them and know one has time for that.< /text>

This place is always moving, they are all really good and do quality work! You can pick from hundreds of nail designs or bring in a picture of something and they can do it! Also, you can't beat the prices!! Seroously, best place around! !</Review>

The lady I got was RUDE! Don't ever tell a customer WHATEVER! She rushed through getting my nails done and didn't do a good job. I got gel nail polish and she didn't fully "polish" my nails. I had to ask her to fix it and she didn't like that.  Additionally, she left the clear gel on my skin on some of my fingernails.< /Text>

This place has the worst customer service. Dont plan on getting your cuticles cut before a nail job. You have to do it yourself. Dont plan to schedule an appointment with anyone your time isnt valued and you will wait for hours. Its better to be a walkin because appointments are never honored..do not get anna (seat 12) for your acrylics she does not care about your happiness or the outcome of your nails. U get what you get dont do it.</Text>

Made a appt a few days, went in by accident yesterday to see if I can come in a day earlier, she says I don't even see your name in the books to begin with. So I went in today, took literally 3 hours for a gel manicure! I missed my hair appt and was late for everything else I had for the day. My 5 year old neice would of done a better job too. Very sloppy! When I went to talk privately to the manager so I don't make a big scene another worker I wasn't dealing with jumped out of nowhere and started yelling at Me! She accused me of lying! Even the lady who was doing my nails was quiet and very nice. She was rude and embarrassed me in front of everyone. I gave them their money and tip and left quietly. But I will never go back there again due to their rude attitudes they have. 2 thumbs down. Top off they made me sit there for 3 hours, they were mad and acted like they did me a favor!<//Review>

I've been going here for a few years off and on and the service was ok.  BUT TODAY really really made me angry.  I'm usually the first person on the list WITH an appointment because I get there about 8:15ish so I can request the techs I want to do my nails and pedi.  So, today when they called my name and told me to where to sit at the techs station I requested, I'm sitting there for about 10 mins. and all other customers are getting service but me.  So there was a little tiff between 2 of the techs and the receptionists about telling customers to sit down before the techs are at their station.  Then come to find out that the tech I wanted was OFF THE WHOLE WEEK!!!! Now today is Thursday, why didn't the receptionists know that she was off and put me with another tech.  So I told the receptionist I was first and should be getting services and not have to wait. She tells me she'll put me with the first available tech.  I waited about 10 mins and got more infuriated then I just got up throw the nail polish disc and stormed out.  Every time I go I always have to wait for someone.  So what's the purpose of having an appointment when you have to wait. I'M DONE!!!!! They really need to get their act together.</review>

If i could put no stars I would. This place is ridiculously UNSANITARY. I got no gel on my nails a few weeks ago and she argued with me about not getting gel. I noticed a few days later my finger was hurting and I didn’t think anything of it. I went to the doctors yesterday and was told I had an infection on my middle finger due to bacteria being build up and utensils not being cleaned. Ridiculous this place needs to be SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY.</review>

<Review>Great place good artwork & special details, quality products. Get 3 stars due to disorganized wait time, walk-ins 2 to 3 hour wait.  Even with appt, wait is over an hour.  Also, no customer seating, have to hangout in parking lot or sidewalk, cuz u gotta be nearby when they call ur name or lose ur spot. Still go, no nearby place like this n prices are decent. My sets last up to 3 weeks.< /Review>< pictures>

<response>None</response><Review>The place has great potential and art work is nice but its not worth the bad attitude from front desk and careless owner. I cant believe the non sense and drama that goes on unbelievably bad customer service. Aside of appx 3hrs and still manage to ruin my nails
by forgetting to apply clear after doing my crome. The crome came off the same day. I had to go back the next day because they cancel my pedicure appt and when paying the owner for my pedi I told her she had a great business and told her that she need better customer service she grabbed her cell and put the phone on her ear and did not even dial out in the middle of our conversation no class. I told her I will no longer come again she said "Ok". Front desk was so ruthless saying "I will wall out" pretending to quit the job the day before It was very interesting employee behavior.

3d nails and spa more like 3d nails and hell. So disappointing this business need better management .<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>1<//Rating></record>

So while back I came here to get my nails and my toes done this used to be my spot I loved it I'd go all the time and every time I would go I would never have a bad experience until one time I went to get a pedicure and the lady did a pretty good job I got a French tip because I love getting French on my toes but then a couple days later if not like a week later I saw like a little dot on the inside of my toenail my big toe and I thought I had to hit my foot on something or something landed on my foot but I know I couldn't remember that happening so then I went back and I got my toes done like 2 weeks after that and then sure enough it was getting bigger and I was kind of like this isn't right and it was getting to the point where I didn't even get a French pedicure that day because of the fact that you can see the spot so well and it just didn't look right with the French pedicure I was so bummed but I didn't think much of it just that it would probably go away so then I about 3 weeks after that maybe a month I decided it was time to do my toes and my nails again and I didn't want to have to wait so long to get my nails done since the wait time there can be like really long * i waited almost 1:30 hours once* so I was looking for a new nail place and my friend posted something on Facebook  about her being at her nail shop and that it was the best so I decided to go (*by the way BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!!!! its my new nail place now and the only nail place I'll ever go to and trust that they're sanitized  I swear to God they're the best it's called》》》》》 I Love Nails in Rancho Cucamonga《《《《《*) Ok back to the story so I get there and they start doing my toes and then the girl takes the polish off of my toe and tells me oh my gosh you have fungus on your toe and I was like what and when I looked it looked like greenish brownish and the. Had grown pretty big and I was so grossed out that I started to think how the lady did my toes the first time and the second time and I swear to you I never once saw them pull out the nail tools out of a sanitize bag at all and then I clearly remember when she was scrubbing the bottom of my foot that she had a small foot scrubber and it almost looked used is she even had to throw it because it broke apart which only happens when it's already at the very end and it's super thin and she got a new one and I was so grossed out it wasn't even funny I was even more mad at myself because I never noticed how unsanitized they were don't ever come I rather pay a few more dollars to get a hell of a lot better service and at least I know it'll be sanitized!! Btw hope they read this if you do be expecting the health department one of these days because I'm reporting you!!!!</Review>

DONT GO HERE. I got powder and the lady on number 15 left them SUPER blotchy and SUPER thin. I asked her to fix it and she denied to (ARE YOU KIDDING ME) so I went to a manager and told her she had to so she did BUT she only fixed the thumbs and she left them looking like LIGHT BULBS. SOO thick at the top... (I got recognized on stage and was so petrified when I saw how horrible it looks when I saw the picture. I added the picture of the nails while I was on stage)  She was so rough and MADDOGGING ME! LITERALLY. I didn't even want to argue getting the rest fixed. I go home and when I pet my dog, TWO NAILS BREAK. I drove back the next day (I live an hour away), tell the girl at the front desk, so she sends me back there when the lady that did my nails is done with her client. She's MADDOGGING ME! as I'm smiling (just who I am) and when I sit down and tell her what happened she tells me almost yelling "YOU CUT IT OFF ON PURPOSE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT! YOU CUT IT OFF BECAUSE YOU DONT LIKE IT! YOURE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT!" OH MY GOD. I got so mad! So I tell her "YOURE CALLING ME A LIAR? YOURE QUESTIONING MY INTEGRITY!? IM NOT PAYING FOR THAT BECAUSE THEY BROKE BC YOU DIDNT DO YOUR JOB RIGHT! I AM NOT PAYING FOR YOUR MISTAKE OF MAKING THEM THIN!" Just then she snatches my hand to see the nails I so called broke and starts yelling in Vietnamese to her coworker next to her and I take my hand back and just then  Her manager is passing by and I call her to let her know what was happening. She didn't even apologize but they send me to go soak it off and after that Is done I wait almost 2 hours! For them to fix these nails. Another lady ends up doing it B.C. The original lady decides not to do it. This new lady is telling me I have to pay! It gets cleared out I don't pay but get this. SHE DID THE NAILS ALMOST 3 centimeters SHORTER THAN THE ONES I HAD AND SHE FILES THEM LOPSIDED. I didn't even bother. I left and can promise I'm never coming here again! These ladies treat their customers like trash and have not a single ounce of kindness to share ESPECIALLY after they have made that mistake. Worse $35 I have ever spent. Now I'm left with a blotchy, uneven, and inconsistent powder manicure and my cousins wedding is today. SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND DONT COME HERE. If you do only ask for Lilly or the lady with tattoos. They're kind and do an amazing job. Sucks they work here with the other unprofessional "nail technicians" that give this business a bad name.<//text>

So simply put dont come here. Yes they are cheap but that isn't always good. If you want somewhere where more than 2 ppl know how to do great designs this is not it. If you dont pay attention to anything else pay attention to this >>>> WHATEVER YOU DO DONT GO TO THE NAIL TECH KELLY!!!!! The short one! She can not do nails! I REPEAT DO NOT GO TO KELLY! Ask for someone else. Every time I've went there I've witnessedsomebody has complained about her and disappointed with her work and she gets embarrassed and starts going off in her language! She hasnt been trained enough for designs but I gave her the benefit of the doubt and what do you know? it happened to me. Long is the best there but talks about you the whole time but hell they all do lol but I hv to give it to her she is good or at least the best there. Go to Jem nails in chino, ca! They are more expensive but They know how to do more complex designs, give good customer service, and don't charge you more to fix their mistakes like 3D. Remember you get what you pay for! Have a blessed one! Hope this helps!<//text>

Girls are rude & very long wait & to top it off when I took off my nails I had this. Came back to the place only so the manager can tell me it’s my fault , then charged me $28 for a manicure & when they were taking  off my other nails they also made me bleed.</text>

The service is horrible, they do not do a good job on your nails cause they rush right through them. The all ladies have attitude and I ended up getting an infection on my toe because they weren't using clean tools I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.<//review>

3D always busy popular place so I thought I'd try it the lack of experience on their staff when it took two employees to try to get one fingernail tip off of my hand and both of them hurt me and cut my finger I walked out before they did any more damage I would not recommend the experience of their staff but their creative techniques yes but that's all and the receptionist was rude</review>

<review>I was a walk in and waited over 2 and a half hours. Finally when i got seated i waited another 20 min, there was miscommunication between the workers of what i wanted done and the new manager was so rude. They have no patience and treat you badly. I never experienced such bad service in my life. I had my child and she got fussy at the end because of how long we were there. Ended up leaving and paying 5$ for just cutting my nails and putting the clear gel on, so i didn't even get my full set. What a waste of time. And they need to get rid of that new manager<//review>< Pics>

I had a really bad experience. The gal that helped me her name is Cindy she was rushing me to pick the color I wanted and she did a horrible job and was really rude and mad.</Review>

The owner is very rude and disrespectful and the ladies doing the nails are the same and don’t make good communication with color choices they do whatever they want and they don’t put oil when they finish which is what is suppose to be done so if you want to go to this place I don’t recommend it first and last time<//text>

Very POOR customer service.  They act like they are doing You a favor and could care less if your not satified with the end results.  Broken pedicure chairs and the shop is dirty.  Will not be returning.< /text>

<Review>Overrated honestly. To begin the girl at the front desk is beyond rude and struggles to call people accordingly so starts huge lines and longer then usual wait times. In need of someone new ! She should not be the first person the guest have to interact with . Then not only do you wait forever the work is mediocre at best. By the way I paid $70 for this set which I wouldn’t be mad since it’s gel but girl was super messy and not neat at all. Not going back to over pay for what.< /Review>< rating>
