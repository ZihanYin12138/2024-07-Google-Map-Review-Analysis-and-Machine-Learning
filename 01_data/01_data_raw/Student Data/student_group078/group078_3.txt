<Name>Jc Bourbon</Name><Text>It was a quick interaction but: a straight-forward man. Came out from his little repair area, and everybody waiting in line told him what’s wrong with their glasses. He took everybody’s glasses and goes back into his repair lab. We sat on the little chairs that were socially distanced patiently waiting for his service. About 5 minutes later he came back out with both of our glasses repaired. When asked if he takes card, he said screws are free; I was just in awe because where else can you find a shop like this. Most shops will probably charge you a decent amount for those little hinge screws. Come here! Support this little business !< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Referred by Costco Optical in San Diego. Had him install nose bridges on mountaineering glasses. Fabulous job.  Absolutely satisfied with his work. I'll recommend him for any eyeglass repairs. The drive and wait was well worth it.< /Review>

There is truly no better place for eyeglass repairs. The man who runs it is a wizard who not only fixes the unfixable, he does it in mere minutes for less money than anywhere else I’ve seen. He’s a treasure, and has saved several beloved pairs of sunglasses and eyeglasses for me and my family. 10 stars!< /Review>

My dad stopped by this weekend to fix his frames. The owner would not even speak to him because my dad speaks broken english. Just snatched the glasses from his hands and attended to another client (who walked in after him).  worst customer service experience.</text>

<resp>None</resp><Text>I was recommended to this place from a friend for eyeglass repair. I put in a call to see if they could fix a pair of my sunglasses for me.

Phone rings: "hotshots"

I said: Hi there, I have a question for you?

No response.

I asked if he could hear me? No response.

Hello, can you hear me? No response.

I assumed we had been disconnected. I hung up and tried again. No answer.

I tried 5 minutes later. "Hotshots"...

Hi, can you hear me ok?

Finally he speaks. "I can hear you", I said "ok because you didn't respond". He became combative and rambled on for 5 minutes telling me "you called and said you had a question, I waited for your question, you didn't ask a question, you hung up on me, you called me, you got voice-mail and didn't leave a message, you called, I answered, you asked if you could hear me, I'm still waiting for your question"...

It was the most baffling exchange I've ever had with a business. Typically when someone says hello and asks "I have a question" you respond with "how can I help you" or "sure go ahead" or something... not complete silence. I didn't know if he was on the line or not and after asking if he could hear me twice, with not a sound out of him. One is only left to assume that the call was disconnected

I was so confused and annoyed by his blatant rudeness that I told him he sounded like a lunatic and have a nice day.

5 minutes later HE CALLED ME with a rambling voicemail "I could tell the second you first spoke that you were an incredibly rude person, and I was right so from one lunatic to the next you have a nice day"

Again, baffled is the only word used to explain how this person does business. When you start off being rude to your guests and then try to turn it around that they are rude. And then call them and leave them harassing voicemails...

If you decide to use this business I would try to keep communication to a minimum because it's clearly something this owner struggles with.< /Text></record>

His work was Superb. Fast, better than fair prices. 5 minutes. I had him change both temple’s and they are better than any new frames. 10 stars.</Text>

<Text>Broke my frames last year.  Went to my optometrist and someone in the office recommended this place.  They also warned me that he was a bit quirky.  A bit of a drive for me, but he repaired the frames and it was only $15.  Just went in again several days ago; turned out I needed a screw replaced and when he finished I asked what I owed.  He said, "Nothing. It's free."  Wow!  Busy both times I've been there, but not a long wait at all.  As far as the comments here about him not being social, I find it disturbing that some comments suggest he has some sort of disorder because he is not social.  WTH.  Not everyone is a social butterfly and there is nothing wrong with that!!  He knows his stuff, is efficient, and apparently no nonsense.  Not a problem if he can do the job.</Text>< pictures>

<text>This place is truly great. He is a true craftsman. My glasses were crooked, I tried fixing them but I couldn't. I decided it was time for new glasses. I usually go to Costco for exam and glasses, but Costco was closed. I went to Stanton optical and had a not great experience. I decided to go to this place and wait until I could go to Costco. I'm happy I did. 1st he fixed my crooked glasses in 2 minutes and refused payment. In my globe compartment I had an emergency pair of old broken glasses. He fixed them and added new lenses. Now I have 2 great pair of glasses. In the shop he had some used frames, I purchased them and asked him if he could do prescription sunglasses. He did. Now I have 3 pairs of fancy glasses.  He had them ready in 3 days, usually it takes 2 weeks. I love this guy. By the way, he is not a salesman or a marketer.  he is a bit awkward.  How is someone like that still in business, because is a craftsman, not a businessperson.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dc72107fde1ae5:0x4f68952d3ca70a9a<//GmapID></record>

I have been going to Hot Shots for over 10 years, there aren't many craftsmen like this left. He is incredibly talented and so reasonable, sometimes my tip has been larger than the bill. Look he's a certain personality though I have always got on well with him. I am always glad he is there so please quit the poor reviews, really!</Review>

<review>All I can say is that this place is amazing. My glasses were broken and no place would fix them but one recommended this place. The guy took one look at my glasses and said no problem. I said I would come back in maybe two hours, he said okay. I had to come back in twenty minutes and they were already fixed. 15 dollars! I was stunned. The guy is definitely on the quirky side and different but professional all the way. He is the best.<//review>< Pics>

<user_name>C Loo<//user_name><user>112132534981451547670<//user><Review>My first time here. Was referred here by Costco San Marcos. They gave me a heads up that the guy was not very personable but was good at what he does- repairing glasses. Very interesting as I don't think a lot of people do this type of work.

I had two complicated repairs and maybe one easier one; the easy one was the nose pad broke off the glasses when Costco adjusted them for me. The other two issues were an arm that broke off when the glasses went through a washing machine :(. The third was stripped screws in the arms of a heavy pair of glasses/ loupes. He was able to fix all of them quickly, efficiently and masterly (as someone else noted).

He is really quite busy- constant flow of customers while I was there but is good and fast and stands behind his work as others here on yelp have noted.

There is a front reception area (he is the only one there) where you wait for your glasses repair. He also has a sign with all the fees so you don't have to ask him anything related to fees.  there is a back room area where he does all his work and repairs. The back room says that he can see you and knows you're there (see photo).

You just have to get over that he is not that Personal. He just might have a slight highly functioning autism. He asked me if I had something to tell/ ask him a couple of times cause I guess he can see me through his camera in the back inspecting the glasses. When I told him I did, he said "I knew it". It was a little abrupt but i guess he's pretty smart.  And, as someone else said, I don't need that. I want good quality work that is guaranteed at very reasonable fees!< /Review>< rating>

I spent an hour trying to fix my favorite Sunglasses, during that time I lost the micro sized screw under my work bench.  I was recommed Hot Shots Eye Glass Repair.  After handing my glasses to the Gentleman working,  I waited about 3 minutes and my Prized Perscription Sunglasses were brought out fixed and looking brand new.  He said the repair was free as there is no charge for the first two screws. He would not take any money for his Labor. This guy is a life saver and an amazing craftsman.  Best Eye Glass Repair in The North County.< /review>

He knows his stuff. Many repeat customers. He didn't even charge me for minor repairs the last three or four times. Fast service usually although he's popular and sometimes you'll find a few people ahead of you. But the wait won't be long.<//Text>

Fast, effective, affordable. I stepped in with a broken pair of glasses and 2 minutes later I left wearing them on my face like new. All in all a pleasant experience, will be coming back.</review>

I have been here before, and both times the customer in front of me was treated with some impatience. They have a way of making people feel like a dumbass if they don't know exactly what they want by dragging you over to the price board and stating like a smart ass what the job you need is called. However, if you fit into the category of "slap em back together and send them on their way", they don't have a problem with you.
Really really solid work, though. Super quick service.  Each repair comes with a lifetime guarantee; free repairs if it breaks the same way again. They kinda do a bang-up job that Works well, but does not look great/ retain the elegant quality of the 230$ Burberry's I wear.
Would give 4.5 if possible for customer experience.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipODeNZ4b8-46a_QJFdL_Ra6ZgMzn79elMSV2pde=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJmZr8Ecx5FK9_qeupTtnp7Xl3pYGiAGnEUXIz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc72107fde1ae5:0x4f68952d3ca70a9a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great place, owner very helpful and the prices are fantastic.  Small, quiet place that specializes in one thing and does it perfectly.  Wish more of these kind of places existed.. it’s so nice to get something done perfectly, by someone who knows what they are doing, and not get ripped off in the process.

If you want your ego stroked, and to be treated like the special person you think you are, go elsewhere and pay 4x the price.<//Review>

< Review>
I've been seeing him for 25 years or something.  He provides the best service at incredibly low prices if not free little minor repair.  He is quick with repairs but with quality work .
I went in during the last week of the year with smashed glasses and a lens popped out thinking I he wasn't going to be able to fix it or I'd be paying out the nose for the repair.  Within minutes he handed my fully functional glasses back to me . $10  he said . Here's a $20 and keep the change was my reply.</Review>

Walked in, got greeted immediately, asked a few questions, took glasses, changed the frames, no payment, and out the door in under 3mins.

I understand the comments about being less social, but that's totally fine with me.  Got me in and out with no charge and that suited me.  Would recommend, seems like the type of operation for quick and efficient turn around, and will tell it as it is.<//review>

<Text>DUDE!  Thank you, thank you a million times.  You saved me big time today. Truly AMAZING service.  I woke up with my 7 year old expensive Prada frames hopelessly snapped where the bridge attaches to the corner of the wire rim.  I went to work, but I could not see my computer screen with my old glasses--and I have a vacation coming up in 2 weeks--so I stopped by my ophthalmologist to try to make an appointment to get new prescription and thank God the tech gave me your card.  "Of course I can fix it" you replied incredulously.  15 minutes later. . . literally good as new--you cannot see where the break was.  20 frickin' dollars, and you refused to take a tip.  I only wish I took a before picture.  (See the "after" picture I posted.)<//Text></record>

<Text>Possibly  the worst experience ever. 1st time I was there,  I walked into the office  and was the only one there.  The owner was in the back and I saw a video camera  and signs saying that we see you and will be right with you.  I was the 1st one in line standing at the counter,  when several people walked in. When the owner came out. He helped   everyone else 1st, even though I told him I was 1st in line. They were all caucasian and I am Mexican/American  born here.  Made me feel bad, but could not be sure. 2nd time came in with my Filipino wife and same thing happens. Only ones there Waiting for 10min when another  white lady comes in. He immediately comes out and asks the lady "may I help you"? I told him that we had been Waiting here 1st. He totally ignored me, but the woman,  having good manners,  apologized and told him the we were actually 1st. He ignored her and then ask the lady again "may I  help you"? In a long loud drawn out voice to make his point clear, that he was going to help her 1st. I thought maybe it was a friend of his or a return customer.  It was clear from their conversation that it was her 1st time here.My wife also spoke up and said that we were waiting the longest.  He ignored us completely and helped the lady 1st. I had to calm my wife down because we wanted our glasses repaired. When  it was my turn, I asked if he could weld the crack in my glasses? He said of course he could  and just walked off with my glasses without saying a word. I was upset that he didn't ask where the crack was, and I also wanted the opposite side done as well. But he just went into the back and started working without another word to me. I had to yell into the back of the shop what I wanted. Still no answer.  When done  he just handed us the glasses and told the price with no word of the work that was done. Living here in California,  I am not used to discrimination like that. It was a real shock that it still happens today. Other reviewers say that he is not much on conversation, but I got a much different experience. In summary, don't go here unless you want a bad taste of discrimination.< /Text>< Pics>

I'm seeing reviews about customer service blah blah blah but the fact of the matter is this guy does phenomenal work for a great price in no time at all. I walked in with about 6 other people and he had us all out of there in about 10 min. Or maybe even less. I'll take that over someone trying to be friend for 5 min before even looking at my glasses. I recommend to anyone and everyone who wants a good product for a good price and doesn't want to spend all day waiting.</review>

Quirky little walk-in shop that repairs eyeglasses while you wait. Pretty popular so you might wait a little while. The guy might not have great customer service skills but he's really good at fixing glasses.  Plus he's quick and inexpensive.  I recommend this place.< /review>

They gave me a slip to take to have them bill Costco. When I went it the man that helped me didn't take the paperwork at all. He just took my glasses and fixed them right away! Like it felt like I walked in and walked right back out that is how fast he was! He just trusted that I had gotten the approval from Costco to bill them as I even tried to give him the paper again. He said he didn't even need it. I must say I was impressed with how fast he helped me as well as how pleasant he was! I walked out with a huge smile. The place was cute too! I wish I would have gotten his name. He was wonderful. Thank you so much! I definitely would recommend this place and I will come here again for any repairs from now on.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I was not the only customer, he work was fast, really quality work, extremely well priced and guaranteed - winner winner. The techs social skills are not very good, he is not rude, but very dry. I agree that there could be a form of autism or a social disorder there. However that only makes me want to support him even more!! I did not go there for coffee/tea & conversation. Met a great neighbor there and the place was just as busy when I left as when I got there. Seriously I would take less conversation from business owners if everyone did their specialty or service as well as this guy.</Text>< UserId.>

They are fixed adjusted and cleaned. Definetly recommend anyone come here for any repairs the young men working here are great at what they do. They can fix any glasses you bring them. It's way cheaper than buying a new pair for sure!! 😊<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

Welded a broken bridge in 10 minutes. Charged $20, tax included, and would not accept a gratuity. Recommend coming in person and be willing to wait. A nice man, but he’s focused on his work- you’re there to get your eyeglasses fixed, not for a conversation.< /Text>

FIVE STARS - fast service (while you wait) - the word is out about speed of service and quality of work here - there's always a line... because he is so popular! NOTE: "some" repairs he does at no charge! (WHO else does that?!?) - quite a pleasant surprise ---very sorry to see one person had a negative experience and rated this shop "one star," but keep it in perspective.. that's going to happen at some point to everybody - certainly not a reason to avoid this shop - many many more happy customers than unhappy ones..</Text>

I have a strong accent, and when I did call this place the owner turns off the phone in my face. Also I was there twice and he was rude. The only thing that is possible is that he may not like people of Latin origin, because I can not understand why he is so rude to me. The time I was there I was polite with him. And in the phone he said hello, so when I started talking with my strong accent he hang up on my face after listening to me. I just asked about houyrs of operation. If he would be there Friday evening.
P.S. I back there again months later and the service was much better this time.</Review>

<Review>GREAT service! Had a great experience. Please ignore negative comments. I had thought that my glasses were broken and needed a bunch of work done which would have cost me $20 but he corrected me and didn't charge me. He let me know that it wasn't a huge problem. He corrected the glasses, gave me a new screw and cleaned them. They looked new!
Took about 8 minutes with 5 other customers coming in and out. If you have a little longer wait its because he has other repairs in the back. Also he had a situation where there was miscommunication with a client and he was very attentive, polite, and remedied the situation quickly. Great shop! Will definitely be back.< /Review>< pics>

No nonsense repairs...Inexpensive is an understatement.
Fast and very inexpensive. This gentleman has repaired about a dozen pair of glasses
for me, friends and family without any stress and always at very low cost.

You go into the small waiting room at street level and wait for the repair man, Doctor of Frames, the miracle worker to come out of the shop in the back. He hands the repairs to those that are waiting and collects his fees. He takes the next batch of repairs from those waiting. Very little explanation is usually needed, he tells you what the bill will be before hand. He goes in the back with your glasses as well as everyone else's. Fifteen or twenty minutes later he returns. Again, distributes the repairs, collects the money and collects the next round of  repairs. Minimum of chit chat, you bring your repairs, they get repaired you pay and leave,
The impossible repairs are repaired.

There is non better....The service is fast and efficient. Take a lesson in hard work,
the grace of no wasted energy and speed. He is the Bruce Lee of eyeglass repair.<//Text>

<Review>I walked in 15 minutes before close expecting to drop off my glasses and wait for the ready for pickup call a week later.
Instead he replaced my broken "pad arms" (I know this because i was directed to the big dry erase board behind the counter which listed services, prices, and an illustrated parts breakdown showing the correct name for each part of a pair of glasses down to the names of the screws ).  I called them nose pad thingys.😬
But I digress, long story short he replaced both pad arms, new pads, and an unsolicited free ultrasonic cleaning in 10 minutes for a very reasonable $15.< /Review>< response>

I went in to have some eyeglasses repaired. The guy working there (presumably the owner) was really nice and did great work. My glasses are better now than before I broke them. Service was prompt, too: I was only there for about 10 minutes. While I was there, he must have told at least 3 people who he had done small fixes for that what he just did was free.

Great little shop!<//text>

Where has this place been all my life?
I stumbled upon this shop on my way to lunch and decided to pop in as I had recently replaced a broken pair of frames with a new pair of the same exact frame but my lenses didn't fit perfectly for some reason and would pop out sometimes. I walked in an saw about 5 people waiting and no owner in sight.  One of the people waiting informed me that the owner was in the back and would be right out.  When he came out he was super friendly and I explained my situation.  He took my glasses, came back within 5 minutes and they were perfect... and the best part, my adjustment was at no charge.
I've since been back for 2 pairs of glasses my husband broke (a nose pad and a hinge) and both were repaired perfectly.
I can't believe people review this guy as being rude! I mean I can understand him being a little abrupt when he has 5 people waiting but I wouldn't call him rude!

Bottom line is, if you have a broken pair of glasses and 20 minutes then this is a great place to go.<//Text>

Went there to get a twisted Ti frame fixed and before I could get comfortable in the waiting room,  he was done and indicated that "we don't charge for that". His efficiency, integrity and straightforward approach has made me a customer for life. I will certainly be back and share my experiences with others in need of this service.
Thank you.< /text>

<username>Dan Greenspan< /username><Text>I agree with the other reviews:
- This guy does amazing work
- Don't be put off by his odd or abrupt manner; his skill is worth it!
- The price is very low

In many places, services like his - actual repair of glasses, like a jeweler - are simply not available.  He re-tapped the screw hole at the corner of my glasses, in just a few minutes, and it cost $5.  Nice!  Quite a contrast to almost every other eyeglass place, which can only replace standard, newer parts, and can't solder of machine anything.< /Text><response>None< /response></record>

Store hours say they are open till 530, walked up at 509 and the door was shut.  I was trying to fix my little girls glasses and don't have a lot of free time to run over to Carlsbad so I knocked on the door thinking maybe it is appointment only or some other one off reason to be closed during posted business hours.  A man (I assume the owner) answered and  asked me not to call (I was holding my phone and I suppose he assumed I was going to call), when I asked if he was open he said no, and shut the door. I went to the optometrist  and paid for new glasses. I would rather buy new glasses than ever give money to someone who is so rude to customers.< /text>

Headed over there right now to get a nose pad... Third time I've been there.  This guy is great... really fair prices... service while you wait... and he's really good at what he does.  Kind a breath of fresh air in todays less than personal service world.  First trip he removed defective glare reduction film... $5.00... second trip fixed broken bail.. $9.00... and always with a smile...</review>

Looking for eyeglass repair.....STOP LOOKING AND JUST GO TO HOT SHOTS....you won't be sorry!!!!

The owner is a compasionate man, making him appear at times,  a little short with his customers, but that is not his ultimate attitude. When I took my glasses to him, I tried to tell him what I needed done with my repair, but he just kept sayinig "I can fix these, do you want me to fix them?" He didn't want me to tell him his business and I should not have tried....HE KNOWS HIS BUSINESS. I had dropped my glasses on a tile floor and the left arm broke off.

Kaiser, where I purchased them and tried to get them fixed under warranty, said the 90 day warranty had passed and they offered to SELL me new frames for $175. That's nuts!!!!

They had no idea where to get the frames repaired.

Stopped at Sears Carlsbad and they recommended Hot Shot. BEST thing ever!!!! My glasses were fixed in 30 minutes, while I waited, and were just like brand new frames.

Other customers came and went during my wait and here is where his true compassion came in. Some had "simple" repair for which there was a '"no charge", others had a second repair for which again "no charge". Despite being warned he might be a little excentric, well maybe, but he did a SUPER JOB  on my glasses and for the other folks who came into the shop during my visit. USE THIS GUY for excellent results.

His prices are VERY reasonable.

THIS IS THE PLACE FOR ANY GLASS REPAIR.</text>

<text>Went in for a pair of Ray Bans that snapped at the bridge.  I walked in, the waiting area was full, the gentleman came out within 5 minutes returned all the waiting customers glasses and took mine and said that will be a bridge repair.  Great fast service with. One year warranty with receipt. Professional soldering.  I highly recommend.</text>< Pics>

< review>
I bought a pair of glasses at Andrews about four years ago.  They didn't fit right when I first got them.  I went back a week later, the person said, "Faces are uneven so they won't fit perfectly."  I adjusted them myself.  A year later I went back to get them adjusted.  I was in pain from them by the time I got home so I adjusted them myself then and for the next few years.  They were totally out of whack this year so I went back to Andrews and the person worked on them but she said the spring was sprung, the hinge was weak, so she couldn't do too much.  I went to Hot Shots to get a new spring.  He said I didn't need a new spring, I just needed them tightened.  He took it in the back, tightened a screw, didn't even try them on me but they fit perfectly, better than when they were new.  And he didn't charge me for it.</review>

<Review>As others have noted, this gentleman is **exceptional** --- and with regard to abrupt or "rude" behavior.......please take care in judging. I firmly believe that you may be misinterpreting behavior.

I'll be taking my glasses in shortly for a new nose-bridge, and I have NO DOUBT that I will leave happy.

Edited to add:

To the persons who wonder "how he can stay in business": His place is frequently *full* of customers, and he always has some folks in the lobby! Anyone still wondering whether or not to take their business to him can check the reviews on yelp. That will settle it!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>This place is amazing! I stepped on a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses and stripped out one of the screw that held the lense in, tried to super glue it back together with no luck. I took them into hotshots and he fixed them in minutes without even charging me for it! I highly recommend this place.< /review><Name>Zachary Mink< /Name><pics>None<//pics>< rating>

<review>My husband took his glasses in to get repaired. The workman took his glasses and several other pairs from customers and went into the work room. He came out and handed glasses to my husband.  When my husband put them on yesterday they were not the right prescription power and wrong pair of glasses. My husband called yesterday left a message and the call  was not returned.I called today and my husband called after I did.  Both times the workman said    "we never give out the wrong glasses, that does not happen here".  It did happen. My husband called and said he would bring the wrong pair back for the customer who got a wrong pair. The shopkeeper told my husband he would not worry about my husband's glasses. He told my husband that "you can do whatever you want to do with the glasses". TERRIBLE SERVICE. The repair work is good, but the customer service is abominable.  BE PREPARED and be sure to check that the glasses belong to you.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Called him back since apparently this is the only place in North County that repairs glasses and he said I'm open until 530 but I try to leave early because if I stay open until 530 I'm actually here until 6. I woiuldnt go into a restaurant 10 minutes before they close. Real smug and condescending. I'll just buy new glasses instead of going to Hot Shots< /review>< userid>

<Text>great shop, without inflated repair costs from other shops. I think someone on here said he has a monopoly on eye glass repair, there are about 10 optical shops with in three blocks of this place, all of which will charge you much more for simple repairs. so that is BS.</Text><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I have been a customer for a number of years.. I live in the Bronx, New York and years ago I've done an internet search to find a business such as this and nowhere in New York City could I find a repair facility that does this type of work. every single time I mailed my glasses to them I have been tremendously satisfied and the customer service I received by phone is excellent!<//text>

Went to the place for the very first time, and the guy there looked at me regarded me as if I was an insect.  I showed him my little boy's glasses, which are being held together with tape on the left side... visibly.  The guy took one hasty look and said it's only cosmetic and refused to repair them.  That was it.

Very, very unfriendly... even borderline inhumane.</text>

Walked in late afternoon, about 3:45. 30 seconds later I gave him my sunglasses and said a screw was missing. He went away for less then 2 minutes and returned with my glasses in hand and he even was shinning them up a bit. I asked what I owed, and he told me it was free. Reading others reviews helped me know what to expect and the whole experience lived up to the high expectations!<//Review>

<review>I HIGHLY recommend this place. I cannot believe what this guy did for $24.00 and in ten minutes, crazy. My 50th birthday gift to myself was an extravagant pair of Prada sunglasses and  ridiculously expensive Dior frames for my bifocals. It's been a few years and they were in serious need of help. I had cleaned the lenses of the sunglasses and ruined them. I had cracked the frame on the eyeglasses. I have a beautiful watch, never worn, that was a gift and could not wear because it needed to have several links removed. My daily watch ( a treasured gift from my children) had not been running for almost a year. I thought I was going to have to go to two different places but this guy did everything. For $24.00! Brand new lenses in the shades, frames good as new on the bifocals, dress watch fits me perfectly ( by the way he just out his hand around my wrist for a nano second and new the correct size to make it!) and my daily watch from the kids is running again. 10 minutes, this guy is amazing! By the way? Prada wanted $275.00 to install new lenses. Read the reviews and give this man your business. You will not be disappointed!< /review>< pics>

In fact, Wal-Mart, referred  me to Bill,  FOR  THE IMPOSSIBLE ANYWHERE ELSE,   MANY  CUSTOMERS, DESPERATE,  COME SEEKING  THE "BILL",  KNOWN FAR AND WIDE BY HIS STELLER REPUTATION,  REFERRED BY MANY OPTHAMOLOGISTS,  THE BUTCHER AT RALPH'S,  EVERYONE  IT SEEMS,  AS I ALWAYS REFER TO HIM...  seeking him out for  that  which nobody else does,  my glasses needing soldering, that I bought at Costco,  DO  NOT  BUY  "FURLA"  FRAMES,  CUTE AS THEY ARE, ARE DREK!  He has  done  the impossible frequently  on glasses pronounced dead, unrepairable,  of  the  rarest type, prescription.  I also meet  the nicest people at Bill's as we patiently wait in a  most civilized, seated line for his rapid, excellent, expertise.  I have no doubt that Bill would refuse to serve anything but nice  people,  as we would line up to support him in ejecting anyone,  fists,  teeth clenched, growling at the interloper being rude, or belligerent  to him, anyone there.  I AM SO  HONORED TO BE A LIFE LONG MEMEBER OF THE BILL'S HOT SHOTS CLUB,  THANK YOU SIR!</review><name>D Rogers</name><Pics>None<//Pics>< rating>

<Review>Came to make clip-ons for my prescription glasses. Told the owner to take good care of the expensive Rx lenses glasses. The owner took the glasses. He came in and out of the room about 20 times to serve others people while working on my glasses. After no less than 2 hour (promised 30-60 minutes), he finally concluded the clip-ons. The charge was 75$+tax. By all means not cheap, but I was ready to pay for an assumed quality custom clipons. The clipons were frameless, and  the metal bridge and two holders were uncleanly *melted* with heat into the shaded lenses. Look amateur and not esthetic. One of these melt binding sits right on and touching the Rx lenses when you put the clipons on. The melt connection is bold and not smooth, so it will imminently scratch the lens. I came back home and look closely on my Rx lenses, and notices 3 new deep scratches on one of my lenses. Right at the top of the len, where he was working to set over the clipon. How could it not happen when someone does not focus on one work. In summary, waste of time, waste of money, and now I need to replace my 200$ thin lens. STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I was very devastated that my long time Gucci sunglasses screw broke off and cause one of the arms to fall off, so I was looking around for a good repair shop and came across this wonderful business that helped me over the phone telling me no appointment was necessary and to just come in. When I got to the shop a very kind gentleman greeting telling me he remembered speaking with me over the phone and asked to look at them he proceeded to take it to the back and returned no later than 30 seconds with a fixed and brand new looking sunglasses. All of my expectations were exceeded and I was filled with joy knowing my sunglasses were fixed, much gratitude and love goes to this amazing business.</Text>

They are so nice and helpful at the John Adams location. I've been coming here for 20 years. The Postal worker Sherry is very helpful to all people and makes sure everyone gets done what they are trying to do and she helps and listens like no other. I stood in line and watched her many times treat and help every person patiently and thorough. One day I pulled out my flip phone and we both started laughing. LOL...< /Review>

Got a letter from my grandma that contained a gift card. When I went to open it, it was already opened from the side. The gift card was gone. My mailbox is secure and only I have access to it, so no one else is responsible for this except the person who delivered it. Did they really think it was acceptable giving me a letter addressed to ME that was already opened from the side and that I wouldn’t notice? That is absolutely disgusting. I hope the mail carrier needed that gift card more than I did. I can’t believe this company would steal from an elderly woman and a woman who is 9 months pregnant. I just received this letter today when it was too late to speak to someone in person but you best believe I will be there as soon as they open tomorrow.</Text>

What in the world is wrong with USPS. Cannot find a phone number for their local office. 3 timesI I send mail back as Return To Sender (Does Not Live At Address) and 3 times the mail the letters back to me. This  last time I even tapped over my address. Seriously? No wonder our mail service faces issues..</text>

Great service all the time. True sometimes the lines are super long and they go out almost to the main front door, but the workers do the best they can to get you out as quickly as possible. Most postal workers have an attitude when they say "next in line". But not this place..All the workers at this post office are super helpful and very friendly.<//Review>

Neighborhood post office with friendly and helpful staff.  It often appears to be crowded during business hours, it is just a small space. The counter is typically staffed, if not the postmaster comes out front to cover. The mailbox lobby is the hidden gem, here. If you need a PO box, you'll know why.<//Text>

The fact that the staff here are friendly is a great start. It can get kind of packed because it is small. I was really not happy that there were no Saturday hours since they opened too late and close too early for  me to take advantage before or after work. They just updated their hours though and I can visit on Saturdays now.<//Review>

<text>First a little background info.  I purchased a home in January 2014. My property taxes would be due in December 2014.  I was expecting two tax bills, one for supplemental and the other being the normal tax bill.  I received the supplemental tax bill.  I never received the normal tax bill.  I physically went to the taxing agency thinking there must be an address problem because my home was purchased earlier in the year.  I was wrong.  I never received the tax bill because the PO had returned it to the taxing agency.    Why?  I do not know.  Both the supplemental bill and the normal bill had been mailed the same day to the same address.  It turns out, the county keeps very good records on every piece of mail.  They actually gave me a document showing that the PO had returned it.  This mistake nearly cost me a substantial amount of money in penalties.

I don't know know where this mistake occurred.  It could have been in the automated sorting system or it could have been human error.  In either case, it's unacceptable.  I've tried to bring it to their attention to no avail.  Initially, I tried to call (does anyone ever answer the phone there?) as well as online (which was mostly offline).  Then I went to the PO to try and alert them that there might be a problem somewhere in the system.  Just try to get someone to listen, even with documentation.  I've always been a huge fan of the PO and have tried to support them in may ways because I want them to stay around.  But this situation certainly took them down two notches.</text>< pics>

The mail carrier has placed my mail in the wrong mail box three times now, and leaves my packages on random tables in my complex out where anyone on the street can see them rather than putting them on my porch where they are supposed to go. I've had to call/email to complain so many times and it happened again yesterday. I don't understand why my mail is being put in other peoples mail boxes.< /Text>

Went by this place today (Sunday) and it was closed up tight  Their hours on Google say open today and one of their two signs with hours says they're open on Sunday. The other one has no hours listed for Sunday. Kinda sneaky, right? And, not cool if you're the one who drove all of the way there.
Called while sitting in their parking lot and no answer either. Bad customer service.</review>

Amir is the best...we have done business many times and I have never left disappointed of feeling like I got ripped of or taken advantage of.I have been a satisfied customer since they first open the doors of this business and anytime someone is looking for a phone or phone repair I always send them here. Best service and price that's why I give them 5 solid stars!<//Text>

Called them 5 times 3 of those times they hung up on me 2 they just let it ring. After they finally picked up they told me they couldn’t buy my phone and just hung up. Didn’t even wait for me to respond. Worst place. Don’t go.</Text>

<text>It i could give 0 stars, i would. This place is a joke. They took my phone for repair, installed wrong part, made me wait 1 week when they clearly told me it would take 2 days. On top of that they said they installed new battery, they did not, they charged me for it thou.. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS PEOPLE.. BUNCH OF THIEVES.</text>< pics>

I took my IPhone here to get the screen fixed and they messed up my battery! Smfh my battery wouldn't charge higher than 10% and they gave me a dam 5c which was a down grade. Now the 5c doesn't even work good it powers off on its own l. Plus this shop reeks of weed smoke like they smoke in the shop and they have puppies and dogs running around one puppy was chewing my shoe while I was waiting. Very unprofessional and they RUIN your devices! STAY AWAY!!</text>< pics>

Wow i just called  this metro store location to bring my business to them  but never mind..
They don't even know how to answer the call to a customer.. The person who answered  just said
(Hello wait)  to me and he just hung up on me. So this store it's not for me.<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) This place does not compare with others, they really treat it as a client should be treated, personal attention, and also know the needs of the Hispanic community, without thinking, or doubting it!
I recommend it.

<review>A beautiful small mid-century modern church tucked in to peaceful surrounding grounds. The Sisters make delicious products that are for sell at a walk-up window. I love their pumpkin bread. If you want a nice treat consider buying from them, as it is a great way to support a their sisterhood, where they constantly have someone praying.< /review><UserId.>109392332174426837922</UserId.>< name>

The pumpkin bread is the bomb... we have been buying it for years ..this year we ordered eight  loafs online .. picking up tomorrow.  but I need I think three more that's how good it is. We put cream cheese on it but it's great just by itself.</text>

The pumpkin bread was very good, and will try the peanut brittle next trip. The gift shop has something for everyone, and the quiet serenity of the courtyard and the chapel are very soothing, even to non-Catholics. The nuns in this order are cloistered, so you're not supposed to see them. However, we saw two nuns in the gift shop, though they might have been visitors from another location. If you're feeling troubled, and need a few moments of peace and comfort in the middle of the city, I highly recommend you  visit this little monastery.</Review>

I have been buying their pumpkin bread for the Christmas holiday give away to our doctors offices, mail person, dry cleaners, etc since the bread was only $4.00 a loaf.  It is still a great deal for what you get.  A delicious pumpkin bread like no other!< /Review>

A hidden Sacred treasure. Go Monday-Saturday (before 4:30 pm) to access the gift shop and purchase the home made delicious Pumpkin Bread and candies made by the Nuns.</review>

Cloistered nunnery that bakes tasty treats to support their non-profit cause.

The pumpkin bread is moist and generous with the gourd. The peanut brittle is a nutty explosion of crunchy caramel.< /text>

Cloistered and seperated by jail type bars from the visitors, these nuns have taken an oath of praise.
Praise to them also for not only the baked goods but also the magnificent chocolate confections that they produce!
Well worth a visit if you want to yry something out of the ordinary in the midst of all the glitz and glamor of Hollywood!</review>

Ok, I'm biased, but there's some of the best pumpkin bread and chocolates here in the gift shop!  Of course, that also includes a religious goods store and bookstore.

The chapel is open most days from early morning until early evening, with Adoration when the chapel is not in use for Mass.<//review>

< review>
We’ve been regular customers here for 2 years. While the food is good, the service and management needs to improve. They started to increase their prices, lessening the amount of protein when you add (and pay for) it to a salad, and now will nickel and dime their customers for things like a couple extra pieces of pita bread, garlic sauce, or changing the kind of side salad you get with an entree. Quality is no longer consistent. Pita bread today was very stale. Go back to being a small town local restaurant that took care of its customers. Stop with the nickel and diming.< /review>

{'time': 1622089602501, 'text': 'Mike, we haven’t increased our prices in almost 2 years all the while have also not changed our portions. We do not Nickel and dime our customers, although we do charge extra for sauces and pita bread when a more than reasonable amount is requested in lieu of increasing our prices. Meanwhile rent has gone up each year as well as minimum wage, all trying to deal with Covid that shut us down. We would hope that our customers would appreciate us doing our best in these tough times and give us some grace. In regards to the pita bread being stale we do get fresh bread delivered from the bakery daily, if it wasn’t up to par today I do apologize for that. Just wondering if in the 2 years you’ve dined with us did you ever take the time to write a positive review? We are the same family who have been the owners since 1993, 28 years and we will always be that loving, family restaurant as long as we are the owners. Portions and recipes  have been the same since 1993 I can assure you of this.'}<//Resp>

<Text>My friend and I ordered take out for lunch from here. Everything tasted OK, on the greasy side. I ordered grape leaves and she got a salad and Greek fries. She not only found a bug in her fries but by dinner time my stomach was achy and gassy and within a few hours of that I’m stuck on the toilet with it coming out both ends. I didn’t end up being able to leave the bathroom until about 2 or 3 in the am. 4 days later and I’m still having GI problems. I’ll never eat here again & I’ll advise anyone who asks me to skip it.< /Text>< Pictures>

Delicious! Always full of people but still manage quick service. Have been here a number of times now and have never had a less than excellent meal or experience. Always recommend it to my friends who are on or near the Disney lot.<//review>

Gyro- messy presentation. Fell apart immediately and barely any tzaziki.
Mezze platter- OK not great. Hummus had no flavor
Mediterranean fries- perfect!
The prices aren’t good for the quality</Review>

<Text>Chicken Dijon has become our favorite weekly take-out spot! The food is great and it always comes with a ton of yummy chicken. Their staff is incredibly welcoming and friendly, plus the food comes out promptly. The night team does a tremendous job with their service and Stephanie is the absolute sweetest!

It's tasty and smooth, not biting. I like the hummus, falafel and salad. Service is great. Good cluck for the buck.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Great food, but don't order online because somehow they don't really get the orders and when you get to take away your food, it won't be ready at all.
The food and the people are great though.<//review>

I love the CD House Salad- basically a chicken Caesar salad with rice pilaf. It’s served with pita and THE best garlic sauce. I always get white meat and extra garlic sauce. Parking here can get tricky.</text>

Had my husband go there a couple of times in the last 2 months. I like the Mediterranean fries with no feta cheese. I love the garlic and Parmesan on. Each time my husband ordered it from this location, they’ve made regular fries with nothing on it. I went in today and found out the lady serving was the one who served him those other times. I order the fries as Mediterranean and she said plain fries. I explained that I still wanted the other toppings. We get our food, I look inside and only a couple shavings were on it with very little garlic. The weird thing is earlier in the year it was no problem. There would be a decent amount of garlic and parm. I did offer to pay for the extra parm on it. The male cooks gave a a rude look for pointing it out. I will take the longer drive to location in Redondo beach from now on.<//review>

< Review>
Mediterranean joint in El Segundo that offers a simple and satisfying menu of traditional and popular Mediterranean dishes.

I ordered the chicken skewer plate during lunch, and at $11.99 it is a bit pricey (only includes one skewer).

The chunks of chicken are large and juicy, and the baba ganoush and falafels are on point.

All in all a good experience. Will return.< /Review>

The food was excellent.  I had the falafel plate and was thrilled.  The ambiance was a little lacking but nothing bad.  The service was good.</Review>

<text>The food is Medeteranian themed, healthy and good but the facility could use some updating. It is very small, dark and dated.  They have a good house salad with chicken. I would recommend takeout. Portion sizes are very generous. Get hummas and pita with your meal.</text>< Pictures>

Service has really taken a dive in El Segundo.  Always have the cashier repeat your order - it is often wrong.  Always check your order before leaving the store or letting the delivery person leave.  Very often you
1 will have someone else's order
2. part of our order will be wrong
3. part will be missing
4 you will be shorted some item like 1 pat for a family meal.
Plus an undisclosed delivery charge has been added and the cashiers try to deny their own coupons.
Good food shouldn't be this much work!</review>

< Review>
Always a great place to get my tobacco accessories, and they got as good a selection as you will find anywhere. Can't remember the Indian (not Native American) owner's name, but he is honestly a really cool and reasonable guy, and he is the only person I've ever seen working there. Always will work with you as far as pricing goes. Good spot with good stuff....thanks!< /Review>

< review>
The owner is super chill and nice. Went there quite often and built good rapoire with him. Excellent prices on vape accessories. Open until 10 most of the time. Only thing is that he doesn't take coupons. But his prices aren't as bad as some...so it wasn't that big of a deal. All around a very helpful and nice environment with competitive pricing.< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Went into the library to apply to some jobs I couldn't upload my resume through Google drive for some odd reason it was denying me access which made it difficult for me to upload my resume so I put it on the local computer and I asked two people to help me upload it to my application and no one could help me it's so sad got the elderly don't have the same technology experience that I have not people my age have which leads me to say that they need to hire some young people at the library who have computer experience. They were also trying to kick me off the computer do you see that the library was closing in 10 minutes and I had told the old man that this was the last thing I needed to do and he basically ignored everything I was saying which brings me here to google writing this review.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>I'm super confused. This picture was taken Sept 9th, 2019 at 6 pm. As you can see from the hours posted the library should be open, but you can also see that it's closed via the large banner and the doors were locked. Is there a list where I might find out when the library is open in the evenings and when it isn't?</review>< pics>

Beautiful library! A couple things that might be useful to know:
Large print jobs are discouraged, but they only tell you once you get there with a dozen documents you're supposed to print in twenty minutes. They only have one printer and it's pretty slow.
They can't give receipts for printing, but you could have taken a picture of the invoice screen if you'd have known.
You're welcome!< /Text>

<text>The library is a gorgeous mammoth building with huge columns or marble.It's a breath-taking place.The entrance hall is awe inspiring, hinting at what is cradled within it's belly.The collection of materials contained within bleed history.Absolutely gorgeous. The loss of one star only comes from the fact that it's easy to get lost in the halls that surround the core of the library.I was lost for a good five minutes before I could find my way out, and didn't see one other human being the entire time I was lost.This is a must see, especially in an age when books are becoming a thing of the past.< /text>< UserId.>

Think it's great that local libraries still exist.  Great location downtown with friendly knowledgeable staff. Library cards are free.  How great is that? I'm sorry others found it a bad experience.</Text>

<text>Oakland Public Library is a great community resource, one of the places that benefits the public.  When cutting funding was considered, the public voiced strongly their objection.  The library failed to obtain a two-thirds majority needed vote to expand and move the library to a new home.<//text>< user_id>

Did not feel clean. Verification of that, when I went upstairs to use the bathroom. Unfortunately it was so filthy, I tried not to throw up as I exited the library, never to return there.< /review>

This library may indicate Asian language branch but mostly has sections of books in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Vietnamese. I like that there is a section of Asian American works, though not all exclusively written by Asian Americans. Not overly crowded, but relatively small and limited hours.< /review>

The chicken fried rice reminded me of grandpa's master chef fried rice. Dry and add an egg, two to three!  The more the better! 5stars

The veggie vermicelli is good, flavorful and it even has its own veggie sauce!  This place caters to all, veggie options galore and friendly enough to allow customization. 3.75 stars

The pho is gentle from the start, allowing you to customize at will.  More homestyle than the local places around town.  This is hard to rank, because it's not "bam" take me as I am style, it's subtle and says I'm good but adjust me the way you need.  So I'm ok with that, 4stars.

Bring the family, there are plenty of options and tables to boot. I'm coming back.</text>< Pics>

While I appreciate the gesture, I didn’t take them up on the offer.

I ordered the sautéed tofu sandwich. I’m very familiar with Bahn Mi sandwiches. I’ve been to Vietnam. This sandwich was terrible! It was super soggy and unappetising. It’s supposed to be on a baguette. It was a basic roll and the ingredients had it falling apart. I asked for it to be extra spicy. It wasn’t even a little bit spicy. For a $14 sandwich including tax and tip, I expected much more. Hugely disappointing.</text></record>

Small little mom and pop type of place. We came here looking for some hearty bowls of pho and were pleasantly surprised by the large portion sizes as well as the cozy ambiance. The gentleman waiting the tables was really attentive despite constantly running back and forth between the cash register, customers, and kitchen. I ordered the trio which tasted delicious overall! The broth was just the right flavor; however, the meats were not great quality.<//Text>

A cozy place (not huge). But that way one can focus on the food. Which is the reason to go back again & again. Plenty of Meats, Vegetarian food and Great tasting Phó. Order up! You can also customize the sauce at the table. With a little Sriracha (Hot sauce) for a little kick. Lol< /Text><resp>None< /resp><Rate>5</Rate>< Name>

Love finding a place that can do vegan and gluten free with some good protein.  Added some gf soy sauce (which I had with me, not sure if they have some...) but the Veggie Delight was tasty.   Ask for vegan or there may be oyster sauce in it.

Very good.  Stop I!< /review>

The most enjoyable experience. The host was very attentive and a joy to talk to. Food was delicious!! Lives in Monrovia and was very hesitant to try this place out but so glad I did. Hubby is vegetarian and this place have what he love, fried tofu baguette....Delicious! Definitely coming back for more. 💞< /Review>

Great Vietnamese food. Lots of different dishes to choose from. Friendly staff that will help you make the Wright dish selection. Really good lunch specials at a reasonable price. Can't remember the price for the lunch specials Pho, but it comes with all the condiments and s shrimp spring roll with dipping sauce. A cold bottle of Saigon beer went well. They received a Gold Star award from the San Gabriel Valley food critics in 2016 and 2017.< /review>

Cute little family owned restaurant in downtown Monrovia. The ambien is great, nice for a change. Clean and chic, not your typical Vietnamese decor. But don't let that fool you. Their food is consistent and authentic. Love the Pho broth, and pork chop is excellent - juicy and bursts with flavor. Definitely come again</Text>

I always have the best most friendly service here, and I love the crispy egg rolls. I always get the vegetarian pho. I also love the Thai milk coffee, hot or iced depending on what I feel like!< /Review>

Saturday treat! @saigonavenue #banhmi #grilledpork #sandwich
So good! The #baguette was perfectly toasted. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The grilled pork was lightly sweet, the sauce was savory. Combined that with the homemade spread, this is the ultimate sandwich.  Imo</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Small but cozy place. Very nice service. That family running business is in a good location downtown area. We eat here after a hiking route in Moravia Canyon park, so the lunch was delicious.

Price is good. Nevertheless they could do an effort with the cleaning. I am sure it would help to give a better experience to your customers. Because if the people, like me, can see everything dusty and sticky outside, it can make thing about how is inside the kitchen. It does not give a good image of it.

A small but cozy place. A good service. It is a family business with good location in the center of town. We ate here after doing a hiking trail through the Moravian Canyon Park, so the food set us up wonderfully.

It has a good price. However, they could make an effort and keep the site cleaner. Surely it helps customers to have a more pleasant experience. Because if people, like me, see dust and sticky in the dining room, it makes you think that you think about what can be in the kitchen. So it does not give a good image of the site.

Un sitio  pequeño pero acogedor. Un buen servicio. Es un negocio familiar con buena localización en el centro del pueblo. Comimos aquí después de hacer una ruta de senderismo por el Parque de Moravia Canyon, así que la comida nos sentó de maravilla.

Tiene un buen precio. Sin embargo, podrían hacer un esfuerzo y mantener el sitio más limpio. Seguro que les ayuda a que los clientes se lleven una experiencia más agradable. Porque si la gente, como yo, entra ve polvo y pegajoso por el comedor, da que pensar hace pensar en lo que puede haber en la cocina. Por lo que no da una buena imagen del sitio.< /text>< Response>

live in San Diego and take my bikes here...that's how incredible their service is. While I love bikes and have ridden for 12 years I know I'm not a top notch mechanic (as much as I'd like to think I am), but Lynsey and the team at Street Dreams happily took the time to walk me through my bikes status in great depth, what it could use, and what it definitely needed while being incredibly understanding and supportive the whole time. I've gotten ripped off at some shops, poor service at others, but the experience I had here was...for lack of a better word...a dream! I felt super comfortable and understood with both bikes I brought in (Triumph Scrambler and Yamaha FZ09) and the work they did on both bikes was above and beyond. Most of all I never felt in the dark, never was belittled, I knew exactly what they were doing, why, and how much it would cost throughout the whole process. This will always be the place I take any bike I own, their service makes the trek worth it!< /text>

I called looking for tires and within 5 minutes Lynsey had sent me quote after quote on different tires. After they replaced the tires they gave it a full look over and found an issue with multiple solutions that were all expensive and again Lynsey would send a quote before doing any work and a full detailed email with exactly what was wrong. After it turned out not to be the issue, she removed the charge since they were not able to find anything. Her ability to stay in contact with me every step of the way and her mechanics knowledge of motorcycles really out my mind at ease and my wallet thanks them too!
Even if you need something small like an oil change to a complete engine rebuild I would recommend this place!</text>

<Text>If you’re reading this to see if you want to use this shop, consider yourself lucky to have this solid shop close by!  Count me another one of their many happy customers.  My bike emerged purring and 10 times shinier.  Wait did they give me someone else’s bike?  Hey I’ll take it!  Seriously though, I can’t ask for better communication and more trustworthy service from Lynsey and team.  I was given a clear estimate and updates throughout.  No surprises, no funny business.  They were flexible with my needs and just a pleasure to work with.  I felt like I was handing my bike off to friends who had my best interest in mind.</Text>< UserId.>

As for the tech, he was a complete professional and returned my bike in better condition than when I dropped it off. My bike feels like its brand new and shifts smooth as can be.

<text>Lynsey is great, after installing tires on my bike which she got me a great price on she wiped my bike down and gave me some great information on a new bike I was looking to buy.  Months later I called her for advice on paint and she recalled our previous transaction and gave me the info I needed.  I will be a customer for life.<//text><resp>None</resp>< pictures>

Lynsey was polite and knowledgeable. Brought in a Honda VTX1800 with severe fork seal leak. Needed front brakes done, and unfortunately they were a dirty disaster from the leaking. Dario and her did the work and cleaned the bike up fantastic-which I wasn't expecting. that was nice. Future service I will return to them for, as I am quite pleased!, Recommended.<//text>

<text>Awesome competent service,  focused and to the point recommendations, fair pricing, very thought after, mostly need appointment, but you could get lucky. Lynsey, the owner serves with a smile and consideration. If you live around OC and need an honest motorcycle repair shop. Street Dreams is it!< /text>< pictures>

Amazing service and communication from Lyndey. She made sure I got all the parts I wanted for my zx6r and that I was totally happy with everything. The service tech was awesome and took very good care of my bike. They went above and beyond to overlook the bike before I left too. I'm going to recoment all my friends get their bike serviced here!</review>

Honest, thorough, great service through and through. They'll inspect your bike and find things you maybe didn't but they're not pushy. Glad to give them my business.<//Text>

<Text>Just wanted to share my experience with Street Dreams. I have a trackday coming up and broke a banjo bolt for my caliper and was scared I would not have my bike ready for the trackday. After a few calls to multiple shops, someone recommended I call street dreams. Luckily I did, she said she did not have new ones but may be able to find some old ones. She found 2 and let me have them. This is how a motorcycle shop should be ran, helping other motorcyclist in times of need. I have never used her shop but she still did not have trouble helping me. I will definitely be taking my bikes to Street Dreams for any future work.<//Text>< pics>

Just stoped by to check the place out turned out my new R1 had some small issues that I didn't know about, straight from the dealership! Lindsey was super helpful and very informative and easy to talk to! I use to go to metric method and after going to this shop I'll never go back, I highly recommend this shop to anyone that is hesitant of other people working on there bikes<//Review>

This is the best shop I've ever been to. They are small enough to where customer service is outstanding. The owner Lynsey is awesome! She always quotes a fair price for parts and labor and communicates with me if anything comes up when my bike is there. She goes above and beyond even when the shop is busy. Been going there for years and should have written this a long time ago.< /text>

< review>
Yeah so the mechanics are actually good at what they do,and do a really good job. I would give the mechanics 4 stars out of five simply because they lost a screw that holds my fairing to my bike. Since they had to take my fairing off I thought it was a good time for me to clean it up and the owner offered me some Polish, which I thought was very kind and sincere until she charges me the cost of a full bottle along with some other cleaning supplies she decide to expense at my cost. I only used less than a couple squirts  out of respect for her  bottle. I was recommended to come here from a friend, to which I was looking to establish a long-term buisness relation with this shop since it's close by. However these little things do matter to me and what's done is done.<//review>

<Resp>{'time': 1531259489586, 'text': "Hey there Daniel, I'm really sorry to hear this.  There is a small shop supplies fee on every estimate, and I sincerely apologize if I didn't properly articulate that charge.  The polish however was not included on your estimate.  I try to wipe down every bike that comes in with some spray polish if time permits, but wouldn't ever charge for that.  I would really love to come to a resolution on this, is there any way you could give me a call if you had a moment?  I would really appreciate it.  Thank you Daniel, and again i'm very sorry that you had a dissatisfying experience with me.\n\n-Lynsey\n(949)-582-2115"}< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

I brought in my kids quad for what was probably a hassle of a diagnosis request, and I was treated well and felt like my project mattered. A great little shop where I got on-one-one attention and great service. Two thumbs up!< /text>

Lynsey blew me away with her awesome customer service. She let me borrow a ramp to get my bike to her, no questions asked, it was fixed up beautifully in less time than she quoted me, the price was fair. I immediately referred another friend to her and will be coming back for anything I need in the future!<//Text>

I bought my tires here and I got a great deal.  I hate going to a dealership for tires or oil change because you pay hundreds more no exaggeration.  This shop are very friendly and do good work and dont charge you a crazy markup on your parts.  And the manager is a kind of a fox. I hope thats not sexist lol.<//review>

We so appreciated the repairs made to our Toyota Tacoma. We were given a fair appraisal, and all work was done expertly. Because we were leaving to see family out of state, they kept our truck safe for us until our return... and even washed it for us. This was above expectations! Thank you so very much!!!</review>

Milo did an amazing job of repairing rust and corrosion under the paint and damage on the hood of my car (2017 Pacifica). It came back looking better than new, perfect color and finish match.  They did a great job of answering my questions and giving me updates on the progress and when it would be completed.  I couldn’t be happier with their work and service.< /review>

<review>My daughter had her much-loved 2010 Mini Cooper repaired. A parking lot mishap resulted in a significant dent in the tail gate with the goegeous, metallic blue paint chipping off! The staff is great.  They dealt directly with State Farm insurance, and the car looks great now - thoroughly cleaned and shined.  They even finished a day early!< /review>< Pics>

<text>Milo Johnson is a great repair shop.  I was involved in a fender bender and took my car over for an initial estimate but because of the professionalism of the great people there, like Jeff and the office staff, (Cathy) I knew my car was in good hands.  They did an excellent job at a fair and honest price.  They were quick and my car looks brand new!  I have taken my cars there on a number of occasions and will continue to go there whenever I have a problem.  I"ll also refer Milo Johnson to all my friends and family.<//text><resp>None< /resp><Name>Donna<//Name><pics>None</pics></record>

I called around 3pm to check the status on my car that had been there since the morning and the lady who answered the phone had the nerve to be rude to me and gave me an attitude stating my car wouldn’t be looked at until 4. I was given a 2 pm appointment. I think someone needs to remind them that they should be nicer to paying customers. I do not recommend them at all. You are better off finding someone else to take care of your vehicle.< /Text></record>

The best auto repair shop in Escondido! I have a BMW M3 and it is a fantastic machine but I wanted to make it look even better. I went to these guys asking for some new skirts and bumpers and they came up with these fantastic pieces. Now I am driving probably the most awesome BMW ever made!</text>

I have used Milo Johnson for the past 15 years for complete repaint  to realignments  on our last 4 cars and have found them to do the finest work the FIRST TIME and EVERY TIME , The owner Jeff Johnson is carrying on the tradition that his family started years ago.  Jeff is also a Rotarian who follows the 4 way test .  He gives everyone the  personal attention  that is not seen any where else in North County .<//Review>

<Text>I had emailed Milo's a few months ago about getting my car's body dent/corrosion free and painted. He stated they could do it all. I woke up to find an hours old Facebook post about painting entire cars. Perfect!! I called to "make an appointment" and they said just bring it in. I did just that. When I told them what I wanted, they said they do not do full car service. Waste of a trip. I guess the skill set of the workers is pretty low.<//Text>< Pics>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>I have always done my own auto repairs over the past 18 years. I hate having to take one of my cars somewhere for things like alignments which are beyond my tool set. I especially hate being given a hard time about modifications that I've done- or dealing with professional mechanics who are less knowledgable than myself. For instance, I've gotten into an argument over whether a sway bar effects alignment. Of course it doesn't!
There was none of that here. I could tell that this is truly a family business. I got the impression that the people had been working there a long time. They took my car in right at the appointed time. The tech test drove my car, aligned it, and test drove it again afterwards. Even though I was waiting in the office, I was grateful for this. I've gotten alignments before where the steering wheel was crooked after and the repair place was reluctant to redo it.
Another important thing to mention is that the total cost was what I expect to pay for an alignment. Most places want to overcharge 50-120%
This is my go-to place for alignments from now on, in fact I'm writing this because I swapped another car to rear disc brakes and so it needs an alignment now. I may try them for body work as well.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dbf4974467ae59:0xe64bbe2b30794745<//gmap_id>< pictures>

<text>We’ve been going to this store for all of our AT&T needs and everyone is always helpful. The other day we upgrade our phones and the person helping us was really helpful, I think his name was Clifford. He was able to answer all of our questions and I felt like he took care of us as quickly as the phone updates would allow. He deserves some employee of the month type accolades!</text><name>Davy Huffman</name>< user_id>

<Text>I went in to get the glass protector put on my new phone and Lorenz went above and beyond for me. He took time to make sure it was absolutely perfect while teaching me how to do it myself. He saw me struggling with my clear phone case afterwards and helped me put that on making sure that everything was perfect once again. Made the entire experience quick and painless.<//Text>< pics>

Horrible customer service from the “new manager” Yesenia. She was in a hurry to get out of there and pretty much insulted my husband. We have been with att forever but after dealing with her...I just have no words or I’ll just get upset again. I hope Att reevaluates her position. Notice the attitude in the picture below.< /Review>

Jarrod was awesome!! He was extremely helpful. He made sure my husband was comfortable with all phone options based on his needs. Even when I didn't fully understand the numbers he made sure to ask what I didn't understand and if he could better explain so I would.</review>

Lorenz was polite and helpful today when I came into the store. I got what I needed and left happy.

I had the opposite experience a couple days ago with one of the female salespeople when I came in to purchase a new phone. I won’t mention her name but I was very put off by her aggressive sales approach. It felt like an interrogation and I really didn’t appreciate being asked “why?” every time I told her I wasn’t interested (in the multiple products she tried to talk me into.) I’d much rather do business again with Lorenz.<//Review>

Lorenzo was very knowledgeable about product and plan info. He made sure to explain the plan options that would best fit my wants and needs. I would give this guy a raise if I was his boss.  Personable, professional, and the best screen protector installer I’ve ever met. He took the time and care to make sure my son’s new iPhone and birthday gift was ready to go before I left!!!< /Review>

<review>Chris, was very patient and helpful during my visit today. I came in with so many issues with my account. He was able to resolve it very fast. He was knowledgeable with handling my issue.

<text>Daniel was amazing !!! He helped me tremendously and we got lines that I wasn't using took off, another line added, and an unlimited data plan for a price that I can definitely afford. I can honestly say he is the most truthful sales representative that I have ever worked with at at&t!!
Thank you so much!!< /text>< Resp>

At first, I spoke with a customer service person over the phone and after our conversation I was ready to leave AT&T as a whole, SERIOUSLY! The lady I spoke with on the phone was horrible but my guy Jared Kay saved the day He made me laugh, helped me with my bill, helped me with my Safari and got me sett up with the purchase a new phone when in return in a few weeks. Also , this other guy assisted and the entire experience (minus the phone call) was stupendous!!!! They rocked out!!!!!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Oscar was fantastic! He went above and beyond and provided excellent service when it seemed like our issue was a lost cause. He spend over 4 hours with us dealing with the issue. While it never got resolved the way it should have been, it was not his fault and he did everything he could to help. He was professional, kind and provided excellent customer service.< /Text>

Husband and I went in to get new phones and switch over to their plan. There was one other customer in there and then me and him. They said only one of us was allowed inside 😂 and the place is pretty big. So I just literally stood outside of the door. Their policy makes no sense. Just a forewarning for anyone coming here with another person. It says the store capacity is 22 people and I'm counting 5 people. I asked if I could stand in the corner far away and wait and they said no lol don't waste your time with people who's policy makes zero sense.< /Text>

Zero enthusiasm about their job, the visit to update our account plan and order 2 new watches took 2 1/2 hours!  And one of the watches they ordered wrong.  They never asked us to confirm the purchases in the store.  Took another hour hour on the phone this morning to fix the problem.  The poor guy helping us was struggling with system issues and the other employees were too busy talking about politics and basketball to help him unless he asked.  That’s a great manager who doesn’t step in to see what the delays are!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Patty was awesome and definitely played a huge part in my decision to switch my wireless service provider to AT&T. I came into the store I decided but after the customer service Patty provided, it was an easy decision to switch. She was very knowledgeable of the products, listened to what I needed and recommended the perfect plan and phone for me. We came in a little late right before closing but didn’t feel rushed which we greatly appreciated.<//text><date>1598762640990< /date>< user>

<text>Lorenz went above and beyond our expectations when we went in for a phone upgrade. He was very straightforward in pricing and made sure we had the best deal. We needed to wait for my boyfriend’s phone to complete a data transfer, but the time flew by talking with him. We left as extremely satisfied customers. Thank you, Lorenz!!< /text>< userid>

I wouldn’t go to this store. We added a new line and were told we couldn’t trade in or upgrade a paid off phone. It met AT&T upgrade eligibility through the website. They said we couldn’t upgrade due to them thinking we were committing fraud.

The store reps don’t know their own company. Immediately after, I called customer service. Customer service told me since it’s a new line, you can upgrade after 14 days. I feel bad for the manager of this store, because if you took Business 101 in college, you learn that business is essentially about making profit. The fact that he didn’t want to upgrade us, he loss out on a huge chance to make more revenue for their store.

My Dad, who’s been a financial manager for 40+ years, knows way more than this manager. If a customer wants a product, you sell it. It’s that easy. I pray for this manager because with his rules, this store will easily be closed in the future. Good luck bud, hopefully AT&T pays for you to take business 101.

To the Manager: Per company policy, you’re wrong. It’s two weeks to get a new phone from adding a new line. I have email traffic proving it.

On the better note, I can’t wait to see you in two weeks to get our phones. 😊< /Review>

Just have to say I was have a horrible day before coming down to a local att store looking for a gift. I meant Patti and she started helping me with a last minute Christmas gift. I had to find a iPhone 12 max pro in stock for my oldest daughters gift under the tree. Patti helped me through everything, she did t give up until I left with a phone in hand. I have to say she went above and beyond to make me a satisfied customer. After the say I had this was what I call a “Christmas miracle” meeting Patti. She truly made my day and also is gonna make my daughters Christmas! Also found a way for me to save money with a better plan!

I highly recommend if you are in need of att help come down to Vacaville and see Patti.< /Text>

<text>Gisselle handled all of my concerns and made sure they were all taken cared of. She verified that everything was working and checked my account to see if I qualified for any additional discounts. She noticed I was paying for two iPad lines and asked if I needed more than one, when I told her that I only needed one line, she informed me on how to cancel the one I didn’t need. I was initially upset with my AT&T/Firstnet service, but Gisselle made sure I was a satisfied customer when I left. THANKS Gisselle!</text>< gmap_id>

Rosanna the AT&T associate was easy to work with. I told her exactly what I wanted, she gave me a few options, she set me up, and I was out the door. She wasn’t trying to push anything on me, she help me set up my two new phones, it was seriously the easiest transaction. Thank you Rosanna, I will definitely be coming back to see her should I need anything else !< /review>

<Time>1602121415399<//Time><rate>1<//rate><Review>I initially went to try to exchange a defective phone that I had just bought 3 days prior as the speakerphone had stopped working, and I was told the store just didn't have the 11 Pro in stock so to try another store or return to that store at a later date. So I came back to the store a few days later (11 days after purchasing the phone) and was told by Terrence and Mikayla (manager) that I would be charged a re-stocking fee in order to exchange a defective phone they had sold me without any attempt at customer service. When I brought up that I had previously been told that it could be a simple exchange since it was within a 14-day window, I was told to go through the warranty with Apple for a new phone or see if Best Buy would be able to exchange the phone. Best Buy was shocked at the poor service I had received at AT&T and the fact I was told they would exchange a phone that had not even been brought from Best Buy in the first place, they did offer to start the Apple warranty process through Geek Squad but it would mean being without a phone until the new phone was shipped to me. So I called the Apple customer service line which informed me that AT&T should easily be able to exchange with no charge since it was already determined to be defective and not damaged. So I called the AT&T customer service line where they also told me I should be able to exchange the phone in the store without any additional fees, but they would be willing to start the exchange process over the phone and ship me a new phone as soon as possible.

Chris at the Vacaville ATT store was AMAZING!! He was extremely professional and had me in and out of the store in the quickest time possible.  He was extremely knowledgeable and even showed me new ways to use my phone. I highly reccomend if you go to the Vacaville store ask for Chris. He will have all of your questions and concerns addressed and taken care of.</Review>

<Review>Dishonest sales associates and the store manager presents as unprofessional. This place only cares about money, and the sales associates work on commission; which explains the need for dishonest behavior.  I am sitting at the Verizon store as I type this.

<username>Nehemiah T</username><user>104324373268376934286</user><review>Solid store with good employees. I found my experience at the store always depends on the sales rep helping me. Some of the employees in store only care about helping people who will be lining their pockets by the time they walk out the door but majority are far more helpful. Definitely call ATT customer service for technical issues before going in store as this is what they will be telling you to do anyway.</review>< Rate>

Only give it 2 for the cleanliness and pleasant greeter. AT&T is a tough company to work for in the wireless sector. They give those people little room to negotiate, that's why T-mobile does so much better. After18yrs of being a customer they could never budge on int'l rates...tough crowd. T-mobile had no problem working with us.</Review>

Every single time I’ve walked in there I’ve been turned away saying that I have to go get help somewhere else. Or call the 1800 number. What is the store there for if they can’t help with any customer service in store???? Super disappointed that I made the switch.</Review>

< review>
Worst sell phone experience of my life. I normally never give a bad review.Not the way one plans to spend their Birthday. My husband and I already knew what we wanted and had talked via chat with At&t online. The store worker acted like we were an inconvenience, I'm sorry that I can't remember her name. If you don't know cell or contacts learn before you go into this store. I'm so happy I have cell knowledge and sales experience. This young woman misled information, gave incorrect information, and I what I would call a lie. She talked so fast that I asked her to repeat things more than once so I could explain what she was trying to say to my husband... He isn't old, she just talked that fast. She acted like or had little to no  knowledge on the new Samsung 10 phones, while looking up information on the phone I asked about the camera different between the two different Samsung 10 phones and she could even explain what kind of camera it was. When I explained the information to my husband and again we told her from the start what we wanted and went to start the new contract she told us she couldn't because the people that needed to change information their office is closed at 6pm.<//review>

Waited 20 minutes to be helped and when we finally were it was by the lady who checked us in and was just standing there not busy the whole time. She also lacked personality and customer service skills. Sadly they need to up their game for customer service<//Review>

<text>My dad lives in CA and I live in MI. One of his friends needed some assistance with their new phone they bought from here. I called today and got Nhu Shin (spelling??) who helped greatly! Glad there are great employees out there willing to go the extra mile.<//text></record>

<review>If I were able to post without providing a star I would. I thought they had good customer service, so I drove 15 minutes to their store when I was less than 5 minutes away from an AT&T Store... bad call! I walked up to the door, which was opened by a sales representative. No one asked could they help me or if I had an appointment. I proceeded to the phone I wanted to upgrade to to "look interested" and still no one approached me. I went to the phone cases and did the same thing. I looked back and there were about 10 sales reps all standing by the door, clueless, with a look of anticipation on their faces for a customer to walk through the door. HA!! I walked out! I sat in the car for a few minutes and decided to go in to inform them of their customer service issue. I walked back in and was approached by a friendly sales rep and I asked her could she tell me where the nearest AT&T store was? She told me their store was. I proceeded to tell her about my experience and that I would not be spending any money in their store. Had I been approached earlier I would have gladly completed my upgrade. The manager is clueless and should probably take notes from the manager in the Fairfield store. Yes, Fairfield has a long wait time, but they are working with less than half of the employee's Vacavile has!< /review>< Response>

<review>Have an Asus Zenphone 2E that I bought 4 days ago at a different store.  The phone shuts off randomly, I have to turn it on about 20 times a day.  Asked for a replacement, but they wouldn't do it because I have to be added as a 'privileged' user to my parents phone plan.  They suggested I bring my parents into the store, who live 4 hours away.  No resolution to my problem, I am stuck with a bad phone until I can get with my parents and get into a store.  This store and company have terrible customer service, I am glad I pay money to them monthly.<//review><user>110434464552748641831<//user></record>

I would give negative star for the horrible customer service and how terrible the internet and cable service is, feels like I have old satellite service where you lose service off and on during a wind storm. When asked what the problem and doing test I was told they would need to send a tech out and run test and would be a charge $99 if they found something wrong with my equipment. Well my equipment will not cause the cable to lose signal all through out the day and was not able to work from home.

Paying my AT&T bills in a AT&T Store is a chore. Nobody will take your payment. You have to use the self service kiosk. I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT!!! I pay too much per month to have to use a self service payment kiosk. No other company that I know of does this. The AT&T staff should take and process your payment for you.<//review>

If you aren't there to spend money, on something new, they don't want you.  Even if you need help with something that you've had and been paying for, if its not a new sale your not important.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Bad service and racists make you wait for more than an hour and when it's time for you they do not want to attend you and they tell you that you can not get the service without checking why, that is called racism

(Original)
Mal servicio y racistas te hacen esperar más de una hora y para cuando te toca no te quieren atender y te dicen que a ti no te pueden dar el servicio sin que cheque el por que, eso se llama racismo<//Review>
