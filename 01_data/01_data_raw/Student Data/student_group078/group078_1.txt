< Review>
A hidden gem - nestled in San Jose on Bascom Avenue is Tiffany Beauty Salon. Tiffany has been cutting my hair for several years. She is punctual, meticulous, and cuts my lifeless hair into a beautiful bob every time. It always looks wonderful right after she cuts and styles it, of course. The truly amazing thing is how great my hair looks for weeks afterward despite how little I do with it ( I am pretty lazy with my hair - I wash it, but don't blow dry, don't use any product, nor do anything to style it), and yet continually receive compliments on my hair. I attribute this to Tiffany's haircut skills. Currently, with the pandemic, a lot of us worry appropriately about our health and safety. I am thrilled to see all the measures that Tiffany has put in place to prevent the spread of COVID (face masks, shields, social distancing, chairs positioned far apart, appointments spaced out so no one is waiting inside the salon, front and back doors kept open, forms to fill out before entering, temperature checks). Excellent customer service, fabulous haircuts, safe environment - all of this and her services remain very, very reasonable. Thank you so much Tiffany!< /Review>

<Text>I cut my hair in February 2021 and paid $ 50 dollars, Tiffany cut it and it seems meticulous but I did not feel that it was surprising only a stylist with average skills, for the comments that I read I expected much more, the place is clean and hygienic.< /Text>< GmapID>

I get my hair cut by Tiffany or Andy and both do a fantastic job. They really take their time to give a great lasting haircut. I get an angled bob and people always comment on how great it looks.</Text>

Hands down the best quality haircuts for the price. I don't go anywhere else because they do an amazing job for under $10. Very nice staff as well.< /Review>< Response>

I called to make an appointment with Natalie
and Tiffany told me she doesn’t work here anymore
Natalie was so good hair dresser with a  great attitude and smile on her face
I needed a haircut cut and blow dry and asked for an appointment despite Natalie left
Tiffany told me not today , not tomorrow
Ok on Tuesday at 11 am
I was on time on Tuesday and she told me not at 11 , at 1pm
Tiffany play your games somewhere else
I been a client of this hair salon for 15 years before you took over
Your lost my gain
I will spend my money and will get great customer service  somewhere else

<text>Beware - I don't like to write reviews like this, but I feel that people need to know. I got Balayage and a hair cut from Tiffany in Feb 2019 for $89. I gave around 20% tip to the total of 105 charged to my credit card. I came back today to fill in my Balayage and cut again which should cheaper or the same, but she charged me $170. Practically double the price. I  asked her what had changed since last time? and she denied ever charging me that low. I have my receipt and photos of my hair from February to show that it was literally the same color and style. Dishonest and not customer service oriented. Would I be ok with paying $170?...sure, but doubling your price in a few months without giving me a heads up is bad business.</text>< Pics>

Tiffany really knows what she's doing with hair. She was able to expertly trim my A-line bob and also spot mistakes from the previous hairdresser. She trimmed exactly the amount that I had requested -- nothing more, nothing less. The bangs were also cut to look very natural, not too short and not too long. She also gave very expert and professional advice. The cut was slightly pricey at $30 for a short A-line bob cut, but at least it was a quality cut.

Definitely make an appointment with Tiffany as she can be pretty high demand. You won't regret it!</Text>

<Text>Gave this place two stars for the customer service. It was my third time going there and was waiting for the gentleman to finish with his client. I was the only person waiting and i had been there for 10 minutes when someone else walked in, keep in mind the gentleman who cuts hair does a good job and he takes his time. When the the guy walked in the lady asked him if he had an appointment he said yes at 9:30. She turns to me and says "he's first then you thanks". I was pissed, if she would had said something when I got there I could have made the decision to stay or leave. What made it worse was the way she said it, like whatever.

Guy cuts hair good and takes his time to do it right. If you go I would suggest asking if there is any appointments before you wait. They won't let you know until the appointment walks in.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Quite a broad selection of items! And very competitive on their pricing.  Very helpful staff as well. Is easy to find off of the freeway, with easy access back on, with an RV section and repair man avail.< /text>

Desperately needed a starter and they were cheaper than the first place we called, the part was in stock unlike the other place, AND we called just after closing and they stayed open until we got there.  You can't get any better than that!</Text>

<text>I called KeyMe for help when locked out of my car two blocks from their store, and after 2+ hours and a symphony of lies, I was back in my car but much lighter than advertised in my wallet. What a ridiculous, unpleasant experience. Look elsewhere. After he arrived, following a wait more than 2x longer than estimated, the locksmith himself advised me not to use this service, but instead to go directly to Yelp to find a locksmith in the future. That kind of self-defeating, self-flagellating absence of integrity feels perfectly in line with every other moment of this customer-last journey. I hear locksmiths eat their own young.<//text><username>Christopher Quiroga<//username><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I needed a copy of a key and was hoping to get the time to ask the usual person for help.  Lots of time dragged on without getting this done due to my busy schedule.  Then, one day while walking by a drug store I saw a sign posted about getting keys made.  I went in and saw right away how easy it was and I got the key I had been wanting to get for months right away at a reasonable price.  Yay!  Great concept.< /Text>< pictures>

My daughter couldn't get home to let her dog out.
She went to keyme  need a copy of her key and saved it . I went to Vons around midnight tp their kiosk  retrieved the password from my email account and I had a key in 5 minutes. Yay, saved the dog!
I'm 65 years old and it was easier than getting cash out of the bank.....</Text>

Honest and reliable! I came in to replace a car light that was out and upon completion, one of the team members informed me it did not need to be replaced after it. It was just loose. The fact that they were so honest and didn’t just have me purchase a bulb really built trust in me now returning for all services which have all been great. Highly recommend this center.< /review>

Went in to get a tire replaced and after 20 minutes of waiting at the counter, with no one stopping to help, I decided to get a can of fix a flat and try somewhere else on Monday.  When I told the guy at the cash register that he lost out on a tire sale, he said, whatever makes your day.  This country has lost its core essence of manners, service and quality and it shows at Walmart.<//review>

I arrived early for an oil change. It was performed in 35 minutes, I left very pleased with the service that I was given. I guess it's all based on the time that I showed up. Without rushing, and without worrying about other items in my agenda. Thank you Walmart Auto Care El Centro, CA.</Text>

I had just put air into the tire and it wasn't what was put on the paperwork. Also the windshield washer fluid was shown as checked but was actually empty. It makes me wonder what else was not checked. Will not be going back.< /text>< pictures>

The staff that work in the auto care are ok. Could they be more welcoming? yes. It feels like they don't care if you come back or not.</Review>

After I waited the time I went back to find out that they never changed the oil because “The oil drain plug was too tight”, then they proceeded to tell me that I needed to go somewhere else. I was so insulted by the way they told me, I will no longer be coming here for any service. Not only that but I also asked for a wiper change and to no surprise they didn’t do that either, so they had my car and did absolutely nothing to it except for park it in the parking lot. Terrible service, don’t come here for any automotive service. If I could put zero stars I would.< /Text><userid>110986302494889021033</userid><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) It was a day with a lot of air, and I spoke on the phone to say that I was outside to be attended, they had me waiting for more than 30 minutes.

They never answer and I decide to get out of the car to see what happened and Mrs. Jody tells me that she can no longer receive my car for service after more than 30 minutes of waiting and another 30 minutes that I had to wait inside the walmart car service

REALLY VERY BAD SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS, NORMALLY I COME HERE BUT I WILL LOOK FOR ANOTHER PLACE WHERE IF THEY VALUE THE CUSTOMERS.

REALMENTE MUY MALA ATENCION A LOS CLIENTES, NORMALMENTE VENGO AQUI PERO BUSCARÉ OTRO LUGAR DONDE SI VALOREN A LOS CLIENTES.</text>

<text>This was my first time at the office and I was so impressed. Not only was the office space beautiful, but the staff were incredible as well. The dental assistant, Ola, was professional, courteous, and explained everything as he went. I saw Dr. Julian, and I adored her, she is so personable and easy to talk to about your concerns. She performed the MOST in depth dental exam I have ever had, and I was so please and impressed. I left our encounter feeling confident with the plan that we made for my dental health. The dental hygienist, Amanda, was also amazing. She was friendly and professional and was so gentle with cleaning my teeth, but afterwards they felt so sparkly clean!

Usually I absolutely DREAD going to the dentist, but Fresno Dental Professionals will put your mind at ease and provide excellent care! I would recommend Dr. Julian and this practice to anyone that is in need of dental care!</text><resp>None</resp><Rating>5<//Rating>< gmapID>

She goes above and beyond to make me feel comfortable during difficult dental procedures.
She is very gentle, kind and professional.
All the staff including Dawn (registered dental assistant),  Isabel( hygienist) are incredible.

Dr. Asselin is the best dentist I’ve ever seen. I needed an emergency repair before my wedding and she got me in on the Saturday morning I called. She was so professional, reassuring and fixed me up. I have no complaints and scheduled my next appointment with her for a few weeks out. 12/10 would recommend! Thank you again Dr. Asselin!!</review>

< Review>
Treatment is good , but they want you to get treatment by giving very low estimation than actual cost ( looks like they don’t check with insurance or they don’t care) .After the treatment they send bill to pay full amount by saying insurance is not covering.
Be careful when they give you estimation . Check with your insurance otherwise you may have to spend extra ( lot more )money from your pocket.
They gave me $99 estimate and sent $235 bill after I paid $99.<//Review>

<Text>I love this dental office!  From the moment you walk in, staff are welcoming, professional and make you feel comfortable.  My experience with Dr. Asselin has been nothing but positive.  She is very thorough and explains concerns and potential treatment plans with compassion and patience.  This of course after one of the great dental hygienists has cleaned your teeth or performed X-rays.  Isabel is awesome and efficient.  Fresno Dental Professionals is our family’s dental office and we are all happy there.</Text><userid>115544367903156305953<//userid><rating>5<//rating></record>

My appointment was at 4:00pm and I wasn’t called back until almost 4;30pn. The hygienist was apologetic and polite. Once I got into the exam chair the cleaning was the quickest and I felt incomplete that I’ve ever had. I believe I was the last patient and felt like everyone wanted to go home. I left shortly after 5:00pm.
Dr Graebe came in during the cleaning and he even stated he was on his way home.
I’ve never felt so rushed or had such a whirlwind cleaning.< /Review>

<review>Dr. Asselin is amazing and thorough.  Not only is she an amazing Dentist, she is an amazing person and is so meticulous.  I have never known another Dentist to take such pride in their work, treating my smile as if it were her own.  I am forever grateful for what she has done for my smile and for me.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

The staff and Dr. Gutierrez are amazing.  My dentist (Dr.  Towery) retired, so they had very big shoes to fill.  This office exceeded my expectations.  It is extremely clean,  and made me feel very comfortable in this difficult time.  A very modern facility with crazy cool contraptions. Office staff were friendly, informative,  and attentive.  Hygienist and Assistants were absolutely fantastic.  So friendly,  yet very professional.  And the doctor was amazing.  He took the time to explain things to me and address any dental concerns. Obviously a kind & I get a feeling,  very Godly man.  Thank you to all for making this dental transition very easy.<//Text>

<pics>None</pics><review>I had not been to the dentist in roughly 15 years. I'm one of those people who hate going to the dentist. But the experience and comfort I had over at Fresno Dental Professionals was extremely good. From start to finish every staff member was friendly and welcoming. I had a few things the DR went over with me but she did not try to sell me anything and everything under the sun. I didnt feel pressured to schedule my next appointment for the work needed. I have a cracked tooth that will need a crown and even with that being said, they told me to make sure I have it handled but they didn't pressure or try to force me to commit to an appointment date. I highly recommend them!<//review><user>113797231137446838977< /user><rate>5</rate><Date>1601643648987</Date></record></dataset><record>

I’ve had my dental care performed at this office for many years. Always a pleasure visiting. Great staff and Drs. I have never had a long wait. Always seen in a timely matter. Believe it or not, I look forward to every visit I have had. Whether it was for general care or more extensive work, I always feel like family when I’m there.</text>

This place takes Dentistry to a new level. Great communication! The latest in technology and practices. Lying back listening to music through provided headphones made my 3 fillings seem almost pleasant, well.... as pleasant as getting fillings could be for me. Dr. Julian’s methods in particular are better than any dentist I’ve ever seen, and I’ve even a few. The whole team is well trained and professional, and kudos to the brand new location and facilities.<//text>

Consummate skill matched with state-of-the-art equipment in a comfortable setting, gave me complete confidence in Dr Julian and her staff during an extensive dental procedure. Also, the office staff is as caring and professionally competent as the rest of the group. The work that I had done has given me back my smile. I don’t know anyone who relishes going to a dentist, but I honestly can’t imagine a better outcome or dental experience.</Review>

Can’t stop smiling!!
I love to smile big and my teeth have not been looking so great!
Dr Grabe and his cheery assistants, Liz and Krista gave me back my big smile today.
These three are a well oiled machine of art and kindness! All three have the sweetest disposition! Dr Grabe is an artist!
Thank you so much!< /Text>

Came in for a second opinion the first dentist  I saw wasn't to trusting. So I decided to have my work done here. I had a more easy feeling from staff and dentists. Maybe all the beautiful smiles and the friendliness of the office great place. I would and do highly recommend this dentist office for any families who want to feel like family.</review>

Dr Julian's office has been our family dentist for many years.  With our recommendation, many of our friends, co-workers and family members see her.  She spends time to make sure we are comfortable during our visit and get the care we need.  When asked questions she takes the time to make sure we understand what she is doing.  Dr Julian is very kind and carrying and I would recommend her to anyone.<//text>

I'm so pleased with the service that my family and I are receiving from Fresno Dental Professional. They've helped educate and explain the importance of regular checkups. The doctors are great when it comes to each individuals care plan. The administration staffs are also amazing when it comes to setting up payments, making it affordable to get dental work done. If your looking or needing honest and professional dental work, this the place.</text>

<review>Dr. Asselin is absolutely incredible. All the staff are extremely kind and courteous as well. This makes for an absolutely pleasant dentist visit. I highly recommend Dr. Asselin and will do so to everyone I know. This office uses state of the art technology for imagining, they are much more thorough because of it, are gentle with their procedures and will even play some Netflix while you wait. I cannot say enough good things about Fresno Dental Professionals. Give them a try, you will not be disappointed.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I scheduled a visit for the first time and the staff was very welcoming upon arrival. Greated me with a smile and were very helpful since I forgot my insurance information. Sonia was assisting me and made me feel very comfortable since she found ways to make me laugh when I was feeling tense. The service was quick and the doctor are exceptional. I was constantly being asked if I feeling any discomfort and not many dental office do that, so I really appreciate that. I would highly recommend this dental office.< /text>

My family and I love this place. My husband, my daughter and I are all patients here to Dr. Asselin. We absolutely love her. she has corrected our bad dental work done by other dental offices. She's amazing at her job, friendly and patient. The staff here are all so friendly and professional. Fresno dental professionals seriously deserves 5 stars, never have we ever had a bad experience there at the clinic.</review>

My old dentist retired so I was referred to Dr. Asselin. I can not say enough good things about my experience. The office staff was very friendly and welcoming. She took her time to really listen and explain things fully. It's hard to establish a new relationship after seeing the same dentist for 30 years but I am so happy to find a good one. Highly recommend!!< /text>

<Text>I have never liked going to the dentist. I always felt like I was being offered services I didn't need and when I asked questions I'd never get a direct answer. Since I've started going to Fresno Dental Professionals I was blown away with how knowledgeable the staff is. I have never been soo educated on my teeth before!! EVERY appointment the staff is always soo welcoming and friendly. They even take time to speak with you one on one about your copays for any services you'll need. I was terrified to get my wisdom teeth removed because of past experiences. But finally at 32, the great staff at Fresno Dental Professionals, the experience pain free and I was able to get the extractions done in the same office!! They have the latest and most up to date technology and are super fast! If you haven't checked them out, you totally should!! Thank you Fresno Dental Professionals!! :)</Text>< Pics>

I'm a very inquisitive person and it sometimes annoys people but she seemed  to love chatting with me.  Explained every step and treatment plan great.  Super gentle and is just the right amount of chatty when she has hands in your mouth.  The hygienist are very nice and do their best to keep you comfortable. The only bad thing I could say is with billing they estimated what my insurance would pay wrong.  Not sure if that's their fault or my insurance.

<text>We always get the best dental care at Fresno Dental Professionals! (And I am a very anxious dental patient ... but they always put me at ease.)

Today, my son was in for a simple cleaning and he had a new chip in his tooth. He's always anxious about going to see the dentist. But the atmosphere and staff made him feel calm. They are always so kind to us there! I am concerned in these days of COVID-19, but they were being extra careful to keep everything as clean as possible. (Hand santizer when we walked in. Everyone is required to wear a mask. They took our temperature immediately. They asked if he had any COVID symptoms in a questionnaire. The staff and dental hygienist were wearing appropriate PPE. This all made me feel much more at ease.) They are definitely going above and beyond to keep both the staff and their patients safe and healthy, which made us feel better about seeing the dentist.</text>< name>

I’ve been taking my kids to Dr. Julian at Fresno Dental Professionals for years. I also referred many co-workers and even my parents to the practice.

<text>Wrong name, didn't know why I was there, taken into the waiting room for the 2nd time and then they stated the cleaning was cancelled because I had no antibiotics on board (which I appreciated) because of my recent hip replacement so the procedure was cancelled. Thanks too Dr. Julian but all

Stumbled upon this place because I needed a Saturday dentist. I have to say I was impressed. Dentists aren't what they used to be. I saw a lady dentist which was different but she was able to take my tooth out and I didn't feel a thing. She also talked about other issues she saw in my mouth but didn't lecture or shame me. After not going to the dentist for 10 years I'm going back again in 2 weeks. Thanks to Dr. Asslian< /text>

<Text>My daughter Madison loves coming in for her visits with her hygienist and seeing Dr. Asselin. She enjoys the soft warm blankets, head phones and tablets while getting worked on. Her favorite part is getting a goodie bag full of goodies.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I injured my front tooth when I was in my 20's and it has always made me self conscious. Prior to coming here I went to 4 other offices including a cosmetic dentist in Orange County. No one could make my tooth look normal. Dr. Aselin far exceeded my expectation. My tooth looks even better than what it did before my injury. The color, size, luster and shape just blend perfectly. Finally I can smile confidently. Ecstatic!!!<//review>

I have been attending the Fresno Dental Professionals for almost 9 years now. I am very particular with my teeth and even more particular about who cares for my teeth. I met Dr. Asseellin on a plane back from NYC as I am from NY originally was there attending my uncle’s funeral. She was courteous and I had told her I was looking for a dentist. I was living in Hanford at the time. I was impressed with her from the start. NYU grad, specializes in children and working with those who are from lower economic backgrounds. I have witnessed her encouraging her younger clients to brush and use floss and mouthwash more. I have recommended several coworkers to the office as well. The staff over the years have been fantastic with me personally especially Lynn Duncan who helps with your insurance. I highly recommend this office to any family or single person because of how well I am taken care of. This past month I went for a cleaning and I could hear Dr. Asseellin trying to reassure a very young girl that even the princesses (DISNEY) come in for check ups so that they can take better care of their teeth. The hygienists are always pleasant and a pleasure to work with. Do yourself and those you know a favor, go there for your dental health. You will be glad you did. She will change your mind about dentists, I promise you.</Text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Asselin for over a year now and it has been such a pleasure getting to know her and her staff. It can be challenging to find a dental office in our area that is professional and competent. Many times you find that the dentist is great, but the staff horrible, or vice versa.

I have only seen Dr. Asselin at this office and she is just fabulous and great at what she does! I have interacted with many different staff members and they have all been so pleasant. Sonia and Gao are true highlights on their team. Overall, this office is just wonderful.<//review>

<Text>I absolutely love this office! My parents took me here when I was a child and I still go in today. My fiance and son also go to Fresno Dental Professionals.  They make you feel extremely welcomed as soon as you walk in and are happy to accommodate any needs you may have.

A couple years ago, My son was hit by a fly ball during a baseball game and had four of his front teeth nearly knocked out! It was a Sunday morning at 8am. Even though the office was closed that day, Dr. Grabe and his team graciously came in and fixed my sons teeth which included putting some stitches in his gums because they were split from the impact the ball had.

We assumed it would be an expensive procedure, however, it was not. They have plenty of payment plans/options and work with each patient on an individual basis. I also love how they send you reminders in the mail and call to schedule regular appointments. This helps us never miss a cleaning, keeping our teeth happy and healthy!

My family or myself, have never had any silver fillings or caps put into our mouths. Our teeth are well taken care of by Dr. Grabe and my 10 year old son has NEVER had a bad experience with him! Its a breeze to take him in to see Dr. Grabe, Lizzie and Krista (his team)! I highly recommend Fresno Dental Professionals to anyone who wants quality dental care.
I know at least 7 people who go to this office and love it!</Text>< pics>

Dr. Moss and the whole team at Fresno Dental Professionals are absolutely incredible! I've been reluctant to visit the dentist for about seven years and thought taking good care of my teeth was enough. I was wrong. Dr. Moss and his staff did everything to make me feel comfortable during my examination and while filling my cavities. The procedure was painless as I felt almost nothing when the novicaine injections were done, and his assistant let me use her headphones so I didn't have to hear the drill. I walked away pleased with the experience and can honestly say my dentist anxiety is no more.

Dr. Moss also recommended a wonderful oral surgeon, Dr. Andrew Rahn, for my wisdom tooth surgery.

I highly recommend Fresno Dental Professionals for all your dental needs.< /text>

Way too long to deliver a pizza. Should take no more than an hour! I ordered it for my boyfriend to take for work and he can't even take it because they were so late! Called and spoke with manager a couple times. That guy needs to learn customer service skills. Never ordering for here again.</Review>

The worker near her says the name again to her and she ignores her and my bf says the name again twice. Then she finally hear the name and we pay and leave. The problem is was all the yelling nesscary and when she could clearly hear us as the person next to her told her the name twice. I don’t know if there is conflict on interest between the employees but it shouldn’t be projected on to the customer and she seem clearly in a horrible mood and all the other workers looked annoyed. I know it is a busy day since it is Valentine’s Day but just show a little of respect and patience towards the customer or even just to be nice. This is my first times going to Me n Ed’s and I will not go back any time soon. I know losing a customer is really  nothing as other people come but just be nice to your customer and to not project a toxic environment to your employees.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

This location has the most fake and nasty pizza I've ever had from a Me N Ed's. If you guys don't know they use pre-made pizza crust and brush the pizza sauce with a actual paint brush. The owner of this establishment should be ashamed to run a very liked and well known pizza chain in this manner. I will never eat here again and I encourage my fellow madera residents to do the same.</Text>

Their pizza is good. I love the crispy crust, and the fact that their pizza is affordable. The customer service is great and the place is clean and well kept. Always a great atmosphere.< /Review>

<review>I ordered the pizza and was quoted a delivery time of an hour. After waiting 20 min past the time quoted i called them and they said it should be any minute.  10 min. later the they finally showed up.  1 hr and a half minutes late and cold pizza.  Not worth getting it delivered.</review>< rate>

I placed an order here online, received a confirmation email, then picked it up before closing as quoted. However, when I viewed my bank statement, they charged me more than the receipt. I called the next day, I spoke with two people, one manager, and they said they had no record of my order number, or debit information. How is that possible if they had the pizza ready when I got there? Then, they promised the store manager would call me back. They never did. This place is shady as hell. I’m never buying from this location again.< /review>

I been ordering from Me n Ed's for a while, but recently they got my orders wrong and they gave me the most dry and disgusting wings I've ever seen. The girl that took my order was very rude. The pizza they gave me had like 6 sausages. They don't wear gloves either. My family and I will not order from here ever again.< /text>

The great thing about Me n eds is that you know what you are getting regardless of the location.  The crust is more on the crunchy thin side, which is a nice departure from other chains.  Is it going to be the nest you have ever eaten...meh, but it does hit the spot if you have a pizza craving.< /text>

< Review>
Restaurant was clean and food was fresh.  The.manager was not a happy person...moral starts from the top.  He could have a happier environment.
He was rude to my two sons who asked for quarters for the games and he said he was out..no effort at all..  I wasnt happy about how he was unfriendly.....<//Review>

This is the second time I've ordered here the first time the pizza was good. Went last week and when we finally got our pizza... the middle was burnt on the bottom and the topping fell off the crust. Not a good pie at all. But the salad bar was good and the kids can run around the arcade area.</Text>

I arrived around 11:45 on weekdays and both times they told me that it would be at least 45 mins. I just passed. Clearly they are unable to operate a business properly if they cannot prepare for large orders and serve customers. If it only happened once, it would be frustrating but twice is incompetence.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Docking a start since their website isn't too good (some of the toppings are incorrect for the specialty pizza's) but it's my favorite pizza place. Recommending the Hot Hawaiian.</review>

I'm the only person in the store, and I'm told it will be an hour and 15 minutes for a pizza because they have lots of "to go" orders.  Great management Me-nEds!< /Text>

What happened to nick?
I was a regular here almost everyday. He gave me a nice discount for being a regular customer. Now they got this guy who won't give me a discount since he's gone. I guess it's time to find a new smoke shop.
Nick was a very nice guy. This New guy has a chip on his shoulder and thinks his sh*t doesn't stink.
Bring back Nick!<//Review>

Love love love Glass Roots, amazing glass for amazing prices. Not to mention their CBD marijuana is top shelf quality. $40/7gs can't beat it. Stop in at glass roots, you won't regret it.< /text>

People are very cool, they try to be always on good service. Good variety of cigarettes, vape fluids and pipes. Prices are according the market and they have a couple of offers,  just ask.< /text>

One of the best if not the best smoke shop in the whole inland empire! Staff was very professional and friendly! I think it was a guy named Eddie who helped me and I couldn’t have been more pleased with his service. I will definitely be back and I recommend this shop to everybody!!! Good prices for super dope pieces and glass!</text>

So i went to another smoke shop to get what i needed. I think if you open at 10am that you would be ready to greet your customers with a welcome, not sorry, were not open yet. Maybe just lock the untill your ready.< /review>< Date>

The former manager Raid is no longer employed there and that totally did a negative turn for Grassroots in my and many other patrons that frequently shopped there! Its nowhere near the friendly or professional environment it once was! Sad but true fact this store needs Raids personality to ever get my business and many I have spoken to agree! He is what made the experience a 5 star pleasurable and very unique place to buy from! Although he is quite the salesman that always got me to spend more than planned. So if the owner reads this he needs to get Raid back in there!< /review>< Pictures>

Best smoke shop ive been to hands down. First time coming here and they treated me like ive known them for years. (Pleass forgive me if I spell this wrong) Rajid walked me through every step and had amazing service, even though I was being a bit indecisive. If you need any smoking need this is the shop to be at! Ill definitely be back for sure!!! Thanks again guys!

Not to forget to mention the prices were awesome, they definitely do not rip you off here like pretty much all smoke shops.< /Text>

<review>Great service. I went online, created an account, described what I wanted, and was connected with a photographer immediately. I met with the photographer, Aldo, the next day for the shoot. He was professional, easy-going, and knew what he was doing. A fully edited photo gallery was delivered electronically within a day or two. The photos came out awesome, despite there being heavy clouds and a little rain that day. Thanks Snappr!<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNvyIcRuR4ph6s0GSnaNrPl5pnoZeXKXfFeY6d=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

<review>I am a real estate agent in Utah and needed photos of a property my sister owns and rents in the Los Angeles area. I wasn't sure how to find a good photographer in the area. I stumbled onto Snappr and the more we heard, the more we liked. We took a little bit of a chance, not having worked with this company before. We were very pleasantly surprised. The whole shoot was well-coordinated and our photographer, Joakim, was top-notch! We are very happy with the results! And we thought the price was very reasonable. Many thanks!</review>< Resp>

I had such a good experience using Snappr! Its quick and convenient, i was able to book a photographer within minutes. I ran into a small issue, but the customer services reps were quick to get everything resolved! they responded quickly and were able to find a alternative photographer because the original one couldn't make it.<//review>

<Text>Our Company was in need of professional grade photos quickly with very specific before and after (small timing windows) shoots. The team at Snappr was really easy to work with and got the right photographer selected for me, even sending me the photographer Nyki's portfolio, which closely aligned with my needs. The shoot was a breeze and I had received the photos very quickly following. All of the photos were not only high-quality but exactly what we were looking for. Our marketing team was elated. We will definitely be using them again.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>I had a surprise proposal and I needed a photographer to capture and not missed such a important moment. I contacted Snappr and the process was super easy. They connected me with Hector who was super nice and flexible to my requirements. He captured the precise moment and he make sure the lighting, contrast and the colors were frame precisely with us. The value and the outcome I got was all worth it.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Booking Bianca through Snappr Photography was so simple and efficient. I HIGHLY recommend using Snappr (and Bianca if you're in the Oxnard area.)< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>I had an absolutely amazing experience working with Snappr to book a top-notch photographer for a photo shoot. I had a particular vision in mind for the photo shoot and the photographer, Lisa, was super enthusiastic and committed to my vision. The final photos far exceeded my expectations and the turn-around time was much faster than I think most photographers would commit to getting photos back to me. I found the Snappr system easy to navigate and super convenient to review and download my photos afterward. I will definitely be a repeat customer and I'm recommending Snappr to friends!<//text>< Pictures>

This was my second time using Snappr for family photos. Both experiences we SO EASY, and I received beautiful pictures from each shoot. Did I mention how fast? Less than 48 hours later!!! AMAZING!!!! This year we had the pleasure of working with Dajuana - and she had the best eye when it came to helping us pose, and finding cool back drops in the outdoor space we were using. I have two small kids age 3 & 4 and Dajuana's calming presence and efficient approach kept everything moving right along, and also kept the kids engaged. I plan to use her in the future - and have received SO many compliments on our pictures. Most liked insta in feed post of the year by miles.< /review>

I found Snappr on google while looking for a photographer to shoot my  twins birthday party. This is the Uber of photo services but better. So convenient and the App is extremely user friendly. as well. I am a very busy mom and I can't tell you how this is a lifesaver. I hired Dajuanato shoot my twins Birthday and a few hours on Thanksgiving day and she was amazing. Very professional, warm easy to connect with. She blended right in with our family event without making any of the guests feel uncomfortable. The pictures turned out amazing and she really captured both Thanksgiving day and Kids birthday. So happy with that I found Snappr!<//review>

<Text>Snappr was a great find! I decided to get professional photos taken and one day later they were done and dusted with one very happy customer. I received. 63 photos and about 40 were actually ones I really liked. This % is unheard of as is the number of photos I received - especially for the price! Best $149 I've spent in a long time..... and I spend a lot!
Oscar my photographer was amazing - patient and a lighting expert into the bargain! So 5 costume changes later and one hour of my time  all was done! I received the photos two hours later on the same day! What a service. I recommend Snapr unreservedly. 5 stars simple as that.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b824cafd89f7:0xc9976e583ea4500d< /gmapID></record>

VERY WELL EXPERIENCED PHOTOGRAPHER. SKY WAS THE EXPERT THAT VISITED US RECENTLY FOR A FAMILY PHOTO SHOOT. HE WAS EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE, WITH GREAT ARTISTIC PERSPECTIVE. HE WAS PATIENT AND HELPING IN GATHERING THE BEST ELEMENTS FOR GREAT COMPOSITIONS. IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. IN ALL MY FUTURE EVENTS, I WILL GET BACK TO SNAPPR.<//Text>

Snappr is the easiest and fastest app to hire a photographer. Good thing about it is to get the refined photos in to my account within 2 days, Where most of the photographers take weeks to get the work done.
We hired Deanna and she is a natural and nailed our candid pictures. We would definitely come back to snapper when we need a personal photo-shoot.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>There is no reason to ever book another photographer except to use Snappr.  This is the best thing I have ever seen, I use Snappr for birthday parties, for my wedding.  Our photographer Brian was simply amazing, friendly, fun and most importantly extremely talented.  He was a pleasure to have at our wedding and got the most important shots.  Here’s the most important take away, you pay one flat fee and you get ALL of your photos, no extra charge at all.  Understand how costly it is to pay per photo with other photographers, thousands for a wedding.  With Snappr, they are your photos to keep.  You receive them within 48 hours of your shoot, not weeks later.

Snappr is a must, for every event.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

After visiting the website and filling out some information, a personal representative called to answer some of my questions. Once we picked a date and time the photographer of choice reached me via text to introduce herself. On the day of the session Dajauna was energetic, and affirming which made for a great experience. We received our photos within 24 hours and they were all ours to keep.  Again extremely happy with the quality of the photos and the poses.<//review>< Pics>

Snappr is a great way to find a photographer for any type of photos! This is my second time using it when I needed a last minute photographer. My first book was with Kyle S. for a family shoot and the second was Samy P. For a bachelorette type shoot. Both turned out great & the photographers were flexible and accommodating to what we wanted. Booking is super easy, too! Highly recommend this company!<//Review>

Booking through Snappr was very easy, not to mention Kaye from Snappr called me to follow up to ask if I needed any help. She was incredibly helpful and nice. She helped me book Roxanne T who blew my expectations out of the water. Very nice, professional and excellent quality of work. Would recommend 100X over. Thank you Snappr!

<text>We actually called a number of studios in the area to find out pricing and availability for our wedding couple (including family) photoshoot, and then found Snappr.
We couldn't believe our luck. Not only were they willing to come out to our home to capture some home family pics but they also happily accommodated our request to have our wedding couple shoot at the Pasadena City Hall. We booked with Eunice who had great reviews. She was very communicative, and reached out promptly after booking her to understand the style of photos we wanted and the setting. I was honestly super impressed. She arrived promptly, made us all feel very comfortable and at ease. You could tell she was very confident and comfortable with her camera. Snapping away and giving us clear and concise instructions. Our photos were available for download within 48 hours from our photoshoot (which is unheard of today). When Eunice messaged to say my photos were ready for download with clear instructions on how to download them. I couldn't wait to open them, and WOW, we were absolutely blown away!!!
Eunice definitely knows how to capture the moments perfectly, artfully, gracefully, and elegantly.
We LOVE the photos, and can't stop raving about Snappr to family and friends!
Thank you Snappr!!!< /text><user_name>Paula Mellon</user_name><Resp>None</Resp><Pictures>None</Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2b824cafd89f7:0xc9976e583ea4500d< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I just bought my first DSLR camera and wanted to understand how to use it. I saw the groupon for Isla's beginner photographer workshop and I bought it. The class was great. Mike was a great teacher. He made the class fun and easy to understand. I would highly recommend this for anyone starting out with a DSLR camera and wants to learn the basics.</Text>

The photographers and costumer service seem professional but that's only at the beginning, before you pay them. My experience with the photographer was poor and unprofessional, and the photos didn't come out looking professionally done, or like what I made clear I was looking for. However I was understanding and asked for a reshoot instead of my money back but it's been almost two weeks and I am still chasing after customer service. I would not recommend this service, it's worth paying a little extra for peace of mind and high quality photos.<//review>

LOVED using Snappr for our product shoot. Not only are they quick, efficient and (very) reasonably priced but they also have quality industry professionals ready to jump in and get the job done well. Highly recommend  our photographer Casson as he was best in class, went above and beyond while giving our campaign the lens it needed. Thanks again Casson!< /Review>

This is my first time using Snappr.  Jennifer was my photographer.  She was absolutely perfect.  Not only is she a professional photographer, she also gave advise regarding what makeup would look best in the pictures.  We hired Jennifer to take pictures of 5 young ladies and their dates for their Prom.  We received a link to the pictures the very next day.  I highly recommend Snappr and will absolutely book with them again.<//Text>

This was the first time we used Snappr and I highly recommend them and would use again. We were traveling to the Atlanta area for the Thanksgiving holiday and I wanted some family photos taken while we were there. I reached out to a few local photographers but never heard back from any of them. That's when I stumbled upon the Snappr website. I entered my requests for family shots but wasn't certain about the location. A rep from the company called me to get clarification as to that I wanted and where and she paired us up with Marina.
Marina called me the day before our appointment and we discussed what I wanted for a family of 5 adults, we settled on a quaint little park and met there the next day. Marina was wonderful to work with. She quickly realized our personalities, had us laughing in no time, and went along with our families quirkiness, which helped get the lifestyle shots I wanted and not staged or overly posed pictures. She took a lot of pictures, edited some, made some black and white as we told her to use her discretion to do so, and she sent me the link to all of them within 48 hours which meant I got them on Thanksgiving Day.
I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed this whole process. The company has proven wonderful and the photographer herself was spectacular. Oh yeah, the price can't be beat for the service and quality of photos you get!
Well done Snappr and Marina! 😊</text>

This is a unique and helpful website for quick, reasonable, professional photo shoots.  Their availability and flexibility of scheduling and location made it super easy.  My photographer, Doc, was quite helpful.  He made me feel at ease (I don't like having my picture taken...) and was accommodating with regard to back drops, poses, and looks.  He was enthusiastic about the shots and was extremely professional with regarding to lighting, finishing, and expressions.  It was actually fun!< /review>

I had a very positive experience with Snappr last weekend. The photographer that we chose reached out ahead of time to hear more from me, followed up the day before our event, showed up early, was very present at our event, took great photos (great attention to detail and stylistic) and delivered them in under 2 days. The app was easy to use and I would highly recommend it.</text>

We had a long weekend trip with family to Philadelphia and used Snappr to hire a photographer to register our moment. I am so very glad we did this!! Our photographer Nicole was great and we received the photos in less than 48 hours. Her pictures were wonderful! And she got so many of them too. I mean, really SO many wonderful shots. I highly recommend her and will sure be using Snappr in our next family vacation!</Review>

I was skeptical at first until I saw the website and the photos.  We hired Henem to do a Real Estate Shoot for 2 apartments.  AMAZING!!!.  Should have done this sooner.  We are definitely using Henem again.  The owners were impressed beyond belief.   Thanks Again for the great job.  -vickie</review>

Snappr Photography provides efficient and personable service! I contacted Snappr on their website and a communication specialist continued to reach out to me offering help with their services! When I finally got to booking my shot, they were so quick to respond and so helpful in navigating everything. Our photography Olivia was especially professional and did a wonderful job with my shoot. Thank you so much Snappr!<//Review>

I went to Snappr looking for a photographer for my surprise engagement party and got matched up with Oscar D. He was awesome and the photos came out great!
I also thought the customer service through Snappr was excellent.</Text>

<review>I booked Snappr as our photography service for our company holiday, and couldn't be happier with the service, the pictures, and especially the price paid for it all. It was a very easy process to get matched up with our photographer for our site in Eden Prairie, MN, and our photographer, Arnold R, was a great person to work with. He took some great candid shots, and even better, had the photos uploaded and ready for me to view by the next afternoon! I would definitely recommend Snappr, and Arnold R, to anyone looking for a photographer for any special event.< /review><Date>1544811134869<//Date></record>

Snappr was an awesome experience for us. We needed to book a photographer in less than 24 hours and we found an awesome one in Daniel. The experience was seamless and straightforward, asked you a bunch of questions based on what you are looking for, and then suggests a photographer and various time slots. And Daniel was awesome, knew his stuff and produced some really good shots of our product even with the limited resources we had (small room, inexperienced models). Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a photographer and has no idea where to start.< /review>

Had a really good experience with Snappr. Needed photography last minute and we booked online. Our photographer Rocky was easy going and the kids liked him and bottom line, the photos came out great.

Cost effective and I would for sure use Snappr and Rocky again.<//Review>

<review>Finally an affordable photography service with the same or better quality than we are used to.   Joshua called us in advance to talk about what we wanted.  He came to our house on time, was very personable and generous with the allotted time.  Our oldest son is severely autistic and Joshua was more patient with him than we were.  We got the photos that night and I was able to crop and play with them and take advantage of cyber Monday deals on cards the very next day.  This will now be our "go to" for family photos.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

He captured how adorable my in-laws are!
And he was flexible to work with.
The pictures are probably more posed than
Snappr photographers are accustomed to taking, (my guess), but he went with the flow and made the best of what he had, very well.
Thank you!

Snappr really saved me! We needed a last minute quality photographer for an engagement party that was planned in 1 week and I found someone in my area literally 3 days before the event! Michael was incredible to work with and I love how the photos came out! He edited a ton of photos and sent over about 5 gigs of photos. Without him, we would remember this day so differently!</text>

“Sky was amazing! He shot my daughter’s sweet 16 birthday & I was not disappointed. What impressed me the most was how he moved through the event unobtrusively taking candid & posed for shots. I was expecting shots of singing happy birthday, speeches & dancing but what I didn’t expect were so many other special moments that I’d missed like my daughter seeing a dear friend she hadn’t seen in a while, her reaction to a poem her aunt read aloud, a story a sibling shared or a nervous look she had wondering how her mother would embarrass her next. Sky, through his photography, literally told a story of a special night we will never forget. He even captured the details of the decorations! I will hire Sky for every special occasion without hesitation!</Text>

<Text>The process was so easy from requesting information to selecting the photographer.  We used Eric C. and I would highly recommend. Eric was always on time, professional, communicated, and took great pictures.  This was a last minute booking when our scheduled photographer cancelled.  I would use Snappr again.</Text>< Pics>

We really loved Dajuana Jones, whom Snappr rebooked us with, after our original photographer cancelled only 4 days prior to shoot, making us so unnecessarily worried that we'd be stuck with just phone pictures. Dajuana's work more than made up for the stress. She gave us an amazing set of pictures. We booked her for only an hour, but she got all the shots we needed, ran them by us, took some more, and we were good to go in 45 minutes (we really liked the efficiency!). Every single one of about 100 photos is stunning and there is nothing we would have changed about them. Her work with angles, light and pose guidance is absolutely wonderful! Oh, btw, this was contrast-edits only shoot, and the photos are all amazing! The fact that our budget pretty much dictated "Snappr or just phone pictures" made us that much happier that photos came out so great!< /Text>

Snappr is a great way to get amazing family photos at a great price with an awesome photographer. Jon was a great photographer who contacted us prior asked for photo recommendations, scoped the location out and gave all of us great customer service.

The photographer was very friendly, knowledgeable & professional...i liked her a lot. An immediate review of the photos taken looked great but after the editing department got a hold of them, they were ruined and my money was waisted. I asked for a do-over directly from the ceo and never got a response.< /Review>

I was shopping for photographers in the down town Chicago area. I spoke with a few companies whos prices seemed unreasonably high, though their work looked very good. When I found Snappr and began speaking with the salesperson, John, I became a bit skeptical considering how lower their prices were compared to others. John was professional and discussed the details of how their organization worked, he wasn't pushy as I was waiting on the venue to be completely booked for my engagement before I booked the photographer. He connected me with a few photographers and I eventually spoke with Charlie Brown. Charlie was a complete professional, detail oriented and sharp. We discussed the shots that we wanted on the phone and furthermore, I connected Charlie with my event planner and they were in constant contact from there. Charlie captured absolutely amazing pictures and made my fiance extremely happy. We couldn't have had a better experience and I recommend you call Snappr whether you are looking to capture a surprise engagement or any other event and if you need a photographer, make sure you ask for my man "Downtown Charlie Brown"!< /Text>

<review>Snappr was very easy to navigate and helped me find a photographer for an event very quickly. The photos turned out FANTASTIC. Not only did Hector Puig, the photographer, capture the event, but the quality of the photos were amazing. I will definitely book Hector for our next event in LA.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

Great customer service and experience from the Snappr team! The photographer (Jean Marie B.) we selected did an amazing job - and delivered the finished, final photos within 24 hours of the shoot. Will recommend Snappr to my friends and will definitely use again.</Review>

We used Snappr for the first time last weekend to capture some family photos and my 2 year old just wasn’t having it. Sandra, our photographer, was so kind and patient thoughout the entire experience.  Despite my sons sour mood and crying, Sandra was able to get some really good pictures. We are very happy and will definitely reach out to Snappr and Sandra again when we are ready for more pictures.</Review>

Snappr Photography is the most amazing photographer. She was my photographer for my engagement pictures and now for newborn pictures. I would say she is the baby whisperer, my 10 day old went in wide awake and Snappr Photography had her quiet and sleeping in 5 mins. She is amazing and everyone should go see her!!</Text>

(5 star rated) was everything you want in a photographer. She was friendly, patient & funny. She got our sense of humor & let us be ourselves. Our pictures turned out beautiful!!!! Great turn around time too. We will definitely use them again if in LA or (their other locations).< /Text>< username>

<Text>Great concept for scheduling and booking a professional photographer. I have a small business and needed pictures of my business to attract more clients and traffic. And with the photographer I booked, Arnold, the experience surpassed my expectations. I will be booking more services with them due the facility and quick turnaround to get the material.< /Text></record>

<name>Lydia Kennedy< /name><Review>This was my first experience using Snappr. The company is essentially the third party vendor to help match you with a photographer that's right for your event. Whether it's a wedding, personal family shoot, corporate event etc - they will match you with someone in your area and connect you with them. You receive an event link where all your photos will be after the event.
We got connected with Joshua for a business event in Washington DC and he was wonderful to work with. His angels, lighting, candid and posed shots etc were all perfect. My bosses were thrilled to have such great shots documenting their event. I was also very pleased with the fact that our photos were ready within 24 hours and we had full downloading rights to ALL photos.

Snappr makes it easy to find a photographer in your area without having to do too much research. You're matched based on the needs of your event.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>We are based in the Uk and work a lot with musicians in the US. I managed to set up a photoshoot at a gig in LA via Snappr all the way from the Uk! Great Service, Easy to do. Snappr listened to everything I was after and then provided a photographer that best suited that. The photographer they sent was Alberto. He was amazing and has a great eye. Not only did Alberto listen to my instructions of what we wanted photo wise but he also provided so much more! Great Photos, Great eye, Great Service. Will keep using Snappr to organize all my photoshoots.<//Text><user_name>Sleepynightrecords</user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures>< UserId.>

My photo shoot was great in Houston and I got it for a decent price for 1 hour all inclusive. My photographer David C. was amazing, he also was extremely patient with my family and I, which I greatly appreciated. If I ever need a photographer again, I will use Snappr again and I would prefer if David C. photographed my family each and every single time. Thank you David C. for the beautiful photos and your patience. You were a God sent on a special day for my family and I.</Text>

<Review>I used Snappr for professional personal photos that needed updating.  Despite my double booking (my fault) photographers, Snappr corrected and quickly arranged for Delana to come to our house for the photos.  She had great cameras and was very thorough with a variety of photos after choosing the best light -- which was outside.   She was able to modify the photos for the background and quickly provided me with a great selection to choose from.   Very good communication and an easy peasy way to get professional photos at a reasonable price.</Review>< pics>

This was our 1st experience using Snappr.  I came across Snappr when Googling for a photographer for my Granddaughter's baptism.  I requested and received an immediate quote online that was extremely reasonable.  Snappr recommended a few photographers in the area of the shoot.  After reviewing each, we chose our photographer, Jeremiah, who was well rated by other customers on the site.  We made our appointment and received immediate confirmation for the shoot.   Very easy booking transaction.  We received a confirmation reminder email the day before the shoot.  On the day of the shoot, Jeremiah arrived early and we scoped out the best areas for taking photos.  He was very helpful and patient as my 18 month old granddaughter was full of energy and into everything that day.  The day was beautiful as well as the grounds of Wayfarer's Chapel.  Jeremiah did an excellent job capturing all the special moments of the ceremony and we could not be happier with the results. He is a true, skilled professional.  We are most impressed with the service we received from Snappr and Jeremiah.  I will use them again and again.  They really fit the need for what we were looking for.  A 1 hour shoot of our special event at a very reasonable fee.  Great service! A+++< /Text>

<review>I used Snappr to photograph a community Halloween party with over 60 guests with children in attendance. There were so many elements to capture in just two hours - décor, games, costumes, babies, children, parents, varying outdoor lighting, and all the moments of candid interactions.  Our photographer Jean Marie did an amazing job and documented it all beautifully! Every step of the Snappr experience truly exceeded my expectations from start to finish – seamless, fast, and easy. I will definitely use Snappr again!< /review><time>1541392161832< /time>< user_id>

Awesome experience with Snappr. My pics were ready super quick and the service of meeting at a location of my choice was awesome. Photos turned out really good and AJ was the best...super patient when trying to capture our furry family member and really worked to get good shots! The only thing I wish snappr had was the ability to print/frame photos online. I will definitely use Snappr again!<//Text>

I hired Annie from Snappr to capture the memories from my daughter's bday party. The photos came out better than I'd imagined. Our photographer was very nice, and punctual.  She did an amazing job capturing cute cadid moments. My friends and family all loved the photos I shared with them and said we need to hire Snappr every time we have a party.</review>

We used Snappr for taking some headshots of our employees as well as some group shots in the office. We used Hector and he was fast, professional, and had a quick turnaround. The photos came out great! Definitely recommended!< /text>

Experience was so easy. PhotoGraphers found instantly via your location, they contact you a day before the shoot, then upload all the pictures to an online gallery to easily be shared with friends. Our photographer Lorraine was super nice and accomadated all our needs!< /review>

<Review>Recently used snappr for my engagement photos. Couldn't have asked for better service. It was completely user friendly. My original photographer had canceled and snappr immediately found me another photographer, Rocky. Rocky and snappr killed it! My family loved the photos, the work, and everything else that was involved with the photography. Highly recommend snappr and will definitely use in the future.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
I live in Georgia and  needed a photographer during a short trip to Los Angeles during the New Year holiday.  I booked a photographer for a last minute shoot (three days in advance)  using Snappr. The photographer (Dujuana J)  immediately reached out and confirmed the shoot.  She asked for specific details on my vision for the shoot and asked me to text examples.  The day of the shoot, she was very patient while we looked for the perfect outdoor spot to shoot.
Dujuana was excellent at providing direction to my 16 year old to obtain many different poses.  She was verry friendly and very professional.  The photographs were available to me in less than 24 hours after the shoot.  I was extremely satisfied with the final images.  I would definitley use Snappr photography again and recommend Snappr to friends and family.<//Review>

<review>Such good customer service. Aldrin was the rep who assisted my husband and I. We originally came in because of problems with my online account and accessing information. He was able to assist us with that problem. Then we were interested in a phone upgrade. He explained a really great new promotion that was saving us alot on the transfer and he walked us through all the steps it would take from a trade in to the payments and we were able to walk out with a new phone at alot less then we had expected. He was patient and friendly through our many inquiries and we could not have had a better experience. Thank you Aldrin !</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d94c5c9f45c571:0x69b69be187308eb</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>T-Mobile is great but this specific location is run by a horrendously rude, and unhappy manager. (Her name is Eliana) She also covers her name tag on purpose. I have video as proof. Talks down to clients, and retaliates if you question her. Spend your money elsewhere.

Ps…If you do not believe me read the past reviews on Yelp! She is not a good manager, nor does she have customer service skills. 👍👍<//Text><name>Matthew Allsman<//name><Date>1615307450998< /Date><GmapID>0x80d94c5c9f45c571:0x69b69be187308eb</GmapID>< user_id>

The people that work here are beyond incompetent. Was shafted on a promotional deal now my monthly payments are higher than they need to be. Was blatantly lied to when I bought my device and accessories. They have done nothing to rectify the issue. No promotions no gift card just "oh sorry for your experience." Needless to say I will be porting my phone over to Verizon or sprint. I won't even do business at this particular TMobile. I have anger issues and do not feel like catching a "disturbing the peace" charge when dealing with these ingrates.  Do not waste your time here. You are better off going across town to a better location. I honestly feel like TMobile owes me money.<//Text>

<text>Awesome! Luis was extremely helpful setting up my phone. He was meticulous and detailed which took time I believe he noticed I was as well by the way my phone was organized. I greatly appreciated the time he spent with me, 2 hours with my device, answering questions and showing me easier ways to utilize features. I use my device for work and personal he recognized this importance. His customer service work ethic and patience is the best if seen in a long time in addition to....at this location.

I stopped by the store to discuss with staff an issue I was having with an email account that would not sent emails and had other minor issues sharing.

Staff member who’s name is Luis was instrumental in troubleshooting and addressing the issue and ultimately fixing the problem and suggesting alternatives. Job well done, thanks.</Text>

I went to T-Mobile yesterday in the afternoon to get a new SIM card, because the Technician for T-Mobile, whom was very nice, told me I needed a new one. When I arrived I had to wait for quite a while and by the time the girls working there were done with the previous customers, they didn't even acknowledge me. I had to ask them if they were even going to help me. Then I showed them the message the technician had sent and told me to show them,  they had no idea what to do. The one girl laughed at me rudely, and made me feel as though I should have been the fool for not being able to solve their problem. One of the girls was even taking selfies and posting them on Snap Chat. They eventually gave me the new SIM card. The employees clearly had no idea what they were doing, and were very rude. I was not impressed with their customer service.< /Text>

It was difficult getting service . First they told me I only had two weeks to convert my current phone no to a new phone and that it was too late . But then they did it anyway . I had been assigned two phone numbers but wasn’t sure which phone was free to use as I had assigned one to my son . The employee said “Jesus “under her breath”. We finally got it done but with anguish and distress . I left there feeling beaten up . I will never go there again .<//Text>

<Review>I've been coming here since a kid. The staff is generally friendly and they have a good variety of snacks and such. I did have an experience today that rubbed me the wrong way. I bought a Bubble water and two Power Bar Protein Plus bars (cookies n cream flavour). The bars are on sale for 50 cents but I got charges regular price for them. My total came out to be about $7 When I mentioned it, I was only refunded 50 cents. I didnt have time to argue because I was going to be late for my class but I am very upset by it. Never going to trust the sale markings again.</Review>< Pictures>

Very helpful, & this store in general is always giving back or supporting Sac Area's with Fund raising,  Charity's, & ect.  Red Box Machine  for movie rentals, gas, coffee, food, propane & open 24hrs.</Review>

The experience is a little different with covid but still overall a great dinner. Things are more packaged and single serve but there was more than enough condiments to go around. Staff were attentive and food came out relatively quickly. They were accommodating with seating when I couldn't fit my 38week belly into the booth. The soft-shell crab basket is absolutely delicious and the serving of extras(potatoes, sausage) is generous. Seating is limited and you have to reserve in person so be prepared to wait a little if you have a larger party.</Text>

Good place for eating Cajun style seafood. You can follow steps 1, 2, and 3 for the traditional bag of food mixed with spices or the fried items are good too.<//review>

My wife called several times but got no response so we decided to drive seven miles to the place and pace our order in person. We were in line for about half an hour before our order was taken and was told that the wait time was 15 minutes. My wife got the order ready text after an hour. She was again asked to wait until the cashier's area which was visible from where we were waiting and there was nobody waiting. Finally, my wife was allowed to get in and again waited for more than 15 minutes. Staff were walking around my wife but nobody approached her. Our order was finally handed to my wife after a total of almost two hours. Our orders were already cold, the fries were already limp instead of crunchy. We understand that their reason is about the pandemic, but there must be a better system in place. FYI, The Boiling Crab was our favorite dining place before the pandemic. We go to this place almost once or twice a month and the service was way way better than now. It's very frustrating.< /text>

We had 9 total people including 6 children. Got there at 4pm on Saturday, and waited outside or in the car til 540pm. They seated us at 2 different tables. Friendly staff. Fast delivery of the food. The food was delicious 😋 and reasonable price about 150$ we spent. Great place to eat.< /text>

My Margaritas were good and so was my chicken basket with lemon pepper fries I give those 4 stars. However the bag of crawfish with original seasoning was blandddddd. No flavor. I do not recommend especially if you are a seafood lover.</review>

Bad service.  I called several times to order but no answer so we drove to the place.. For a take-out, we waited for more than an hour outside.  The attendant told us it'll take 15 minutes to prepare but it took more than an hour Instead! When I finally received a text message that my order is ready,  the attendant was not attending to me. Instead she attended to other customers who just came. I reminded her that my order is ready but she attended to other things Instead.  There were two of them at the door attending to customers but I don't know why the other one was just standing there and not helping.  I am starving but I lost my appetite...soooooooo disappointed. The food was already cold when we got it.< /text>

My family loved the flavors, the mild spice was spicy enough. Prices seemed steep compared to my last visit before pandemic otherwise it would be 5-star.< /Review>

<rating>3<//rating><review>My first experience here was a good 5 star. But I'll have to drop my rating on my second adventure.
The biggest issue is that some plates just never made it to the table which was unfortunate. Of course those items were removed from the receipt.
The other issue was that the crawfish had basically no flavor. It was very much like it was boiled in water and then just dunked into a bucket of sauce. I needed to dip it in whatever meager amount of sauce was in the bag.
I don't recommend the calamari or softshell crabs. Whatever breading was used simply wasn't very good.
I would only go here for for Crawfish honestly. Just be prepared to ask for extra sauce. Today I took frozen for $9/lb. Fresh was $14/lb.
Compared to other places I've been to where their frozen crawfish just fell apart due to being spoiled and bad, at least this one held together very well.<//review>< pictures>

It's overpriced, but they have 4 kinds of crab. The seasonings are good.  The appetizers are okay...but the fried oysters were no bueno. No inside dining at the time.  BUT they do text you when your order is ready to pick up.

I went to a similar restaurant in Davis this weekend and I spent $40 less for a similar order and the appetizers were bomb and their menu was larger.<//Review>

<Review>I haven't been here in awhile, it's been some years.  The food was just as I remembered though. I had the snow crab and it was super fresh. Fell right out of the shell. The cajun fries were bomb too. I wish they had a larger drink selection cause I'd love a nice glass of wine with my meal or a cider. Overall, great experience for my first time back in years.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPno1nTMVFdezHicWlGMcRf7HL3-bT-qRK6TJOA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>This place is amazing.  Yes we always have 1-2hr wait but go there expecting a long wait and you will enjoy your experience. Medium is pretty spicy so don't get hot if you can't handle hot foods. We recommend the whole shebang & the sausage is a must!< /Text>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><review>This is one of those restaurants where you need to go casually dressed and all hands in,,,,,because it is messy and you will get some of the spices (and food) on yourself. The servings come out piping hot in a plastic bag (this is where I removed one star - why not have a paper bag) which you dump onto your paper covered table. You use your hands to dig in. I have been to this restaurant about 3 times so far - ordered the king crab legs and gumbo soup once; the Cajun crawfish and sweet potato fries the second and the spicy Cajun prawns the third. The seafood is good - crab of course needs to be worked on - the others less so. I wish they had more flavors than they do but what they offer is good. Usually I go for the Cajun or garlic seasonings and a single order of 1 lb of seafood is enough.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809ac56fa4e33517:0x7e5d76b14f7f8976< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I love this place! My only con are the long wait times but in my opinion, the food makes up for the wait! I get the fried shrimp basket, a side of steam rice and share sausage from my husband's the whole-shabang shrimp bag!

Prepare to  wait  two hours for a table. that's just how it is.  Then pay $55 for 3 king crab legs not counting sides (sides are extra). Not a fan , won't be back. Food is ok. service is good, place is clean<//Text>

The Boiling Crab is an amazing seafood restaurant. The prices are very fair for the quality of the food, it being amazing. It is busy most times, but calling in and taking it home is the fastest. The staff are nice and generous.</text>

Really painful to throw down $10 for the Michelada but in my opinion it's worth it if you are there for a celebration. They sell the king crab legs by the pound and will not include a 4th leg for an extra charge if you're there with a party of four, they ONLY come in packs of 3 so you'll be required to share the bounty or Fork over another $29 for a 3 pack. Also they bring the food out as it is cooked so don't anticipate eating every plate all together as a family. In my opinion it's better to get stuff that you can share. I would have given five stars if the floor wasn't sticky and the soap dispenser was empty in the bathroom (if you get king crab legs you will be heading to the bathroom immediately upon finishing) also I wish they had an option to give you an extra king crab leg. The food was excellent the portions were great I'll be at the price was a little high.< /Text>

<review>So disappointed with the boiling crab. Ordered a lobster as I usually do it was small and no meat!!! No taste no nothing $40 bucks for nothing. The oysters are now $25 for 12 .. what the hell? Last time I ordered oysters they were warm and the last ones I couldn't eat I had to spit out they had gone bad. It used to be good now the times I gone it was a hit or miss. Mostly miss. I'm a great customer! And I will not be going back !</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Food was INCREDIBLE! Absolutely delicious. Fantastic customer service. The only minor downside is the long wait to be seated. That is because the restaurant is very popular.<//Review>

<Text>Awesome food! Seriously, best seafood in a bag, the seasoning is amazing and it's so flavorful. My only concern is that they asked for my ID, which sure they can ask for your ID, but they cannot refuse to accept your credit card if you choose not to show it or even if the name doesn't match. That's per Visa and Mastercards regulations. In CA you don't need an ID to get a credit card. The manager Oscar and even the waitress didn't want to accept my Visa credit card, they asked to see my social media accounts to verify it's me (odd because my full name isn't used) they even stood right in front of the exit end of my booth like I was a criminal going to attempt an escape (my fiance put our 2 yr old in the car and I had my daughter with me). I'm a teacher, I'm not going to lose my career of stupidity. They seemed very unprofessional asking for my social media and I didn't appreciate the service I received just because I left my ID at home an hour away! They also scared my daughter over this whole ID issue. So if you eat there you will enjoy the food, but make sure you bring your ID or they might hold you hostage. I will be following up with Visa about this incident, it's not right. IDs are a way of tracking people, there is no law saying you HAVE TO HAVE AN ID just like you don't need one to get a credit card and I'm definitely going to take this matter as far as I can. Businesses are sued over ignorant things like asking for ID. Look at Gap!</Text>< pics>

Amazing food. Never fails to satisfy my boiling crab craving! Some boiling crab branches overcook their food, but this branch has been cooking their food perfectly. Not to mention, always tasty seasoning! Highly recommended< /review>

I have been coming to the boiling crab for years. The weekdays are not bad but, if you come on the weekend prepare for a long wait.
Today was fast,  it was about 5:00pm and we walked in and we were seated right away.
The staff is very friendly and quick to bring our food out.
Being that it was an early dinner I wasn't too hungry. Still, I ate most of my pound of shrimp.
All in all, it was a very comfortable time to come as it was not too crowded.</Review>

<review>Hey what can I say, been going here every year. The same food and the same thing I get. The price are resonable to the food they serve. It may seem unresonable but at least try it, you won't be disappointed. The sauce on the seafood are great. It is thick enough to coat the shrimp and the sauce is good. Its delicious and I'll be going back here every year!!!<//review>< rate>

Amazing food, especially the shrimp. Slightly cheaper than Joe's crab shack but the service is faulty because most of the servers are young kids. Great food, the lobster needed more of a cleaning, like it ate an all you can eat buffet before it was boiled ugh.< /text>

To whom it may concern:
Dear boiling crab or corporate owners,
I used to absolutely love going to the boiling crab but in the past years or so you guys stopped serving fresh sea food. This has been my experience at both locations in Sacramento (the 65th street and k street location). I had stopped purchasing the sea food from the boiling crab and started only buying the “extra juicy” cup of sauce so I can still have the bold flavors of the boiling crab but on fresh sea food I purchased from a reputable source. Now staff is telling me I must purchase the sea food in order to get the sauce. I would have no problem doing this if the restaurant served fresh quality seafood but they don’t serve fresh seafood.Every time I have gotten the shrimp the peel was stuck to the meat and the shrimp was a mushy texture inside. The shrimp I felt a lot like it was boiled frozen and then boiled again . This has happened more than once. To spend close to $20 on a meal just to not have quality fresh food is not ok and this business should not be in operation. Something has to change. You guys need to either start serving fresh seafood or allow people to buy the “extra juicy” cup of sauce. I’ve already yelped about this but am ready to take it to other social media outlets to bring more attention to this problem.</Review>

Menu was little confusing at first when you want to get a bag, but service was great, our server explained everything. It's really good food here, beers a bit pricey though... I mean, c'mon, 5$ for a domestic beer, but overall, this place is excellent.</Review>

<Text>One of my favorites! Love absolutely love coming here . I try as often as I can. I live in Stockton. I come here maybe 5 to 6 times a year. I spend a pretty penny only because I like to come here with my family and spoil them too.. The king crab and the deep fried oysters are the absolute best!!! I even order the deep fried oysters while I wait for a table .

Super long wait but you can save time by joining the waitlist on Yelp as long as you're within 5 miles from the restaurant. The wait is worth it though! We ordered crab legs and lobster. The lobster costs $45 but it's so good! They only give you 1 shell cracker thingy tho (blue color) so if you're not eating alone you should ask for more of them 😀</Review>

This was the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a restaurant. Came in and put our name on the list. Were told the wait would be 2 hours.  We patiently waited outside and checked in every 15mins to see where we were on the list and every time they told us that we had so many in front of us left.  Finally at hour 2 we went back to ask how much longer. And the  host who had been taking names told us that they already called our name and sent a text 1 hour ago. They did not call our name! And not once did they tell us they called our name when we checked in every 15 mins. There was 7 of us standing right outside the door and not one of us heard them call our name.  Instead They had the audacity to try and argue about whether they called our name or not rather than just apologizing. Their system is inconsistent. They sent us a text which we didnt see because they were calling everyone elses names over the intercom or by coming out the door. And not once when we first arrived did they tell us we would receive a text.   I travelled all the way from out of town to try this place and this is how they treat their customers.  Unacceptable. It wasnt until we complained that they magically had a table available.< /text>

This place is totally fantastic. They were extremely busy but the service was very attentive and reasonably fast. It was a young staff but they were very professional. I went there with my wife and one of her good friends. They love Seafood a lot more than me and they were absolutely thrilled with this place. We were visiting the area. Next time we are in town, we are definitely going back.< /Text>

It was me and my husband's 1st time ordering from the boiling crab and we were a little disappointed because the food was salty Aside from that the corn potatoes and sausage were well cooked.< /review>

<Text>Messiah was awesome and on point give that guy a raise, great food soso prices. would be nice to see one side added to the meals without it being an extra tho, diced potatoes or corn or something should come with an 18 dollar plate of delicious crab legs in my opinion.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>I love spicy food and asked to get a taste of XXX sauce.  The waitress stated they do not give tastes, but would ask the manager.  He said no and we went to Crab City.  What a great choice. First there prices are much better,  second they have more choices of flavors and sauces, and most important I was able to taste the sauce prior to ordering. I chose the hot and it was great.</Text>< Pictures>

This was my first time coming here and I will not be coming back. We ordered the snow crab. We asked our server how many people it would feed and she said two. My boyfriend is the one who asked about the portion. It's worth mentioning he's well over 6 feet tall and 200+lbs, so his reason for asking should be obvious. When the crab arrived, we got 4 legs and the belly. Nothing else. No corn, potatoes, nothing. I don't know about you but no way that would feed two people. I've never been to a "crab boil" that didn't include sides. We then tried to order some sides the server said the kitchen was closed. Server never gave us a warning. I'm not upset about pricing or the food itself. But I really feel things could have been made clearer.<//Review>

Small portions and doesn't come with sides that you don't have to pay for. No vegetables or anything. Mussels were good but again the portion was tiny. I'm not a fast eater but I was done before others were halfway through. I think if they offered plates that weren't just fried food I would have liked it. Also lines are out the door but service once inside was good.< /Text>

It was super packed, but that's normal for a seafood place. When you walk in it's too crowded and there's no where to sit or stand. People we're struggling to come in and out of the door due to too many people. Also looked like there wasn't enough tables, so my family and I ordered our food to go. I really wanted to dine in, but better luck next time. As for the food it was great! I just wish I didn't order the Shabang sauce. It was a bit too salty for me.<//Review>

This place is always busy. My only thing about this place is that they've been giving less sauce. They used to be more generous. Overall though, this place is good and easy to find from the street. Parking can be bad sometimes. I would say also the downtown Sacramento location is better tasting than this one for some reason.<//text>

<Text>The place is nice and crowded. If you come during busy hours, you have to wait 10-15 minutes. The waitress who served us was nice and friendly. The seafood bag is decent. I really recommend Sha bang sauce. Love King crab legs, but it's pricey (around $29 per lbs, so 2 legs).<//Text>< resp>

I love the food here! The seasoning for the crab and shrimp is amazing. And the fries taste very good if you dip them into the seasoning. Though, eating here will be quite messy, so I don't recommend this place for a date or something of the sorts.< /text>

A messy, delicious experience for the whole family. My family of five all had the shrimp, it was served in bags (the restaurant menu states that this is to preserve the flavor of the seasonings) and the amount in each was up to the person ordering. The minimum is half a pound which was perfect for my 8 and 9 year olds. My 13 year old, my wife and myself all got a pound of shrimp each and it was just right. Of course your mileage may vary. You can have the shrimp cooked with a variety of seasonings, but I recommend the whole shabang, it's a tasty mix of all their seasonings. The last decision is if you want your shrimps spicy. My family went for the mild and they all loved it, just enough kick my wife said, I had the medium and it was hot but enjoyable. For those feeling adventurous, they have the XXX level of spicy which according to the waiter, is a 10 on a scale of 1-10.  Anyway, delicious shrimp and a whole lot more seafood on the menu.  Ended up paying about 100 bucks for the five of us with two beers and the kids drinks, plus two orders of fries to share. Not bad at all. Drove from Reno to try the place out and I will go again.</Review>

<Text>So good and spicey. I was afraid this would be a very pricey experience but, after all was said and done, the cost was very reasonable and this style of seafood dining brought back so many awesome memories of my childhood when the crawdads were so plentiful every home in the community was feasting for a week.<//Text>< rate>

<Text>This place is always packed but worth it. If you can’t make their opening time then be ready to wait in line for 1.5 hours. You can’t make phone reservations but they’re located in a great area that has boba shops and desserts while you wait. Once you place your reservation in-person you can check your wait time by looking at the yelp link provided via text. They’ll give you a 5 minute warning to return back to the restaurant once your table is ready so don’t stray too far. I got the 5 minute warning when I was 12 parties away. I suggest to wait in the front when that happens.

Parking is a nightmare, so I would park within the plaza and walk.

I highly recommend the soft shell crab with fries. I can never share those and always order two for myself. If you don’t want the fries it’s $1 off.

Be wary of the person sitting across from you when they bite into their corn because the sauce will get into your eyes and will burn.

Update:

Went back here on my birthday. They are allowing indoor dinning. I didn’t get the host name but she was super accommodating to my minor time adjustments. Our server Kelly was great too! The food here always hits the spot. I finally tried the sausage. I highly recommend.</Text>< pictures>

The seafood was great! I got the spiciest option for shrimp. So delicious, I ended up using the excess sauce on rice. 🍚 The line to eat there is very long though, so I strongly recommend ordering out to eat at home.<//Text>

Food was okay but not great for the price. Long wait. Few menu choices.  Service not bad but not experienced servers. Butter was rancid. No wine only beer. Plastic bags to serve food. Plastic forks. Paper table cloth that serves write on. LOUD. Graffiti for decoration. Kind of tacky really.< /text>

My favorite place for tasty Seafood. Visited near twelve, it was not full. Service is typically great. Prices are reasonable I would say.</Review>

Overall though, this place is good and easy to find from the street. Parking can be bad sometimes. I would say also the downtown Sacramento location is better tasting than this one for some reason.</text><pics>None</pics>< name>

<Review>So good and spicey. I was afraid this would be a very pricey experience but, after all was said and done, the cost was very reasonable and this style of seafood dining brought back so many awesome memories of my childhood when the crawdads were so plentiful every home in the community was feasting for a week.< /Review>< pics>

<text>Been here many times, but this last time I was totally turned off by the food, the crab tasted funny and the manager offered to switch it out but I was not willing to get sick from another batch. The extra juicy sauce was thick and cold! Not at all appetizing! They always seem to mess up "MILD" for "HOT" which sucks because then I can't enjoy my food! It's a hit or miss with this place !< /text>< Pics>

This is one of my favorite places to eat seafood with the family. Great atmosphere, great service, I love all the choices. It's a lot more fun when you come with a bigger crowd, but don't let that stop you. If you haven't been, you have to come. If you've been here, I guess I don't have to tell you....lol< /review>

<Text>2.5 stars seems more accurate. My kids have been dying to go here, so we bit the bullet and went tonight. Right off the bat we were excited, because the place was packed we had to wait an hour. Usually a good sign and the reviews seem excellent. Here's what I didn't think was great: the menu was confusing, they were out of Dungeness crab we got the last one, you don't get a meal unless you play almost $10 extra for some corn potatoes and sausage. I got the shrimp, they were whole including the head. I found them extremely hard to eat. Once I did get to them however, the sauce was delicious. The corn was mushy and Soggy but the sausage was pretty good. My wife got the Dungeness crab which was the last one of the day, and it wasn't very good. It was on the small side and some of the meat was tough like jerky or way too fishy. Our waiter was awesome, but for $200 for four people we could do way better on the food. Meh<//Text>< pics>

<text>First timer. They literally bring bags of food and you eat with your hands. No plates, no utensils.  Just crag legs, whole in the Shell shrimp. Good, but I needed a bath when I was done. It was a dining experience. Place was lively, staff were friendly.< /text>< pics>

<time>1539649236393</time><review>I've been to two locations of The Boiling Crab now, and this location was just subpar. The location and downtown is far better. I wish I could say better things about this location, the food was just okay, to be honest I didn't even finish my kalamari, my drink, or my shrimp because it just didn't taste very good. The location on K Street is delicious, the food is amazing.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

Whew!  The service, quantity, and quality is like a more classy, upscale restaurant.  The only thing I would have liked is an actual bar.  However, scale-wise, you get a great bang for the buck in terms of seafood.<//Review>

<text>Delicious food, great service, take out is quick. If you plan on eating inside with a group after 5pm, be prepared to wait at least an hour or two as it gets crowded. There are other great places nearby for frozen yogurt, shaved ice and other treats.< /text>< name>

Great service! GREAT FOOD! Having to wait sucks,no phone reservations SUCKS!! but "it's worth the wait",if have plans to come here give yourself at least an 1hr or 2 for wait,BYOB for the wait or u can do take out if u don't want to wait another thing that stops this place from getting 5 stars is the "no  guarantee wait", on a busy night if u don't get called before closing u don't get in :(</text>

It's packed and we were told out wait was going to be 30 plus minutes and they got us in in maybe 10mins. Our waitress is very nice and quick. Food came out very fast and it's absolutely delicious and you can tell it is fresh. Overall, I can say without a doubt that I will be visiting this place regularly.< /Text>

Great food, meh service, disappointing portions. I get that it's crab, it's gonna be pricey. But I shouldn't have to play guessing games as to how much to order if I'm asking beforehand. That, and if standard boil sides aren't gonna come with it, maybe don't close the kitchen immediately after you serve the table? Maybe it's my fault for coming in late. I still think a little communication would've gone a long way towards making this a good experience.< /Text>

Getting seated...well that's nearly impossible! Showed up today told 25 min wait with 8 ahead of us...while waiting they opened the other half of the restaurant...after an hour of waiting we were still in 9th position! It's very hard to watch people getting seated that showed up after you did in a restaurant that doesn't take reservations! We left and won't be back! Unfortunately they don't care that we left because they know there will be a steady line of people who are willing to take it!< /text>< response>

<Text>I go to that restaurant every weekend because it deserves that. Their Sha bang shrimps are the best. Their baskets are also amazing. I really recommend that place but my only concern is that you might wait for an hour or so if it's on weekends or holidays.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

First off, the food was great, reminded me of being back in La. at some of my favorite places. Secondly, to the guy below who was complaining about not being allowed outside food, they have sausages and chicken strips( neither of which are seafood). Prices are market avg. so its seasonal. Admittedly, service could be better, but no one was rude to me or my family.<//text>

The main attraction is the spices and sauce blends made in house. The price per pound of seafood is expensive but the overall experience is positive. Expect to get your hands dirty!</text>

This was our usual place we would come from Vacaville but the last time we went they were closed for renovations it would have been nice to know that maybe on their website perhaps.. anyways it's a good crab boil, shrimp is ok the sausage is on point!<//Review>

I kinda of hate this place. Everything is way over price and they weight your stuff after they cook it so  your also paying for the 40z sauce of your choice. And I honestly dont like I have to render my card information over an unsecured line just to order crab legs then when I come  to pay with my card I have to render my I'd as well. Youll literally spend like 50 dollars here  for one damn Dungeness crab they also dont do call ahead orders so if your coming far  you either have to wait hella long for good for have your food waiting getting cold.  It honestly cheaper to crab boil yourself with these prices<//Text>

I expected a lot more from the chain. Also, since you buy by weight, I do feel like me an my party of 9 received very disproportionate weights which is very hard to argue but was both visibly and physically obvious. Wait was an hour and was not really worth the wait making it ok.</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809ac56fa4e33517:0x7e5d76b14f7f8976< /GmapID></record>

Their cajun fries are so delicious! So is their catfish and sweet potato fries. I haven't tried the shellfish and the sauces, but Boiling Crab is known for their bags of shellfish with seasonings.<//review>< pics>

The best spicy crab around for miles. I drive 35min regularly cuz we are addicted. I promise u will ♥ it!
Only downfall is no outside food/drinks allowed. I always bring my own cold Pepsi & they make me throw it away. I am willing to buy a Pepsi from them so it sucks to have to throw away money to spend a ton of money. They are the only place i go that won't allow my Pepsi. Lame. Food is worth it tho.< /text>

Service: It was our first time, so the waitress guided us in terms how to order the dishes. She recommended us to order medium spicy because it was spicy for everyone. But I would prefer spicy because medium was blend for me.
Food- We ordered the dungeons crabs which were expensive. And got one lbs. shrimp the "sha bang style". It has tons of oil in the sauce so if you are health freak not a good place to eat. Over all the food tasted okay with medium sauce.
Price -  Crabs are expensive because of the season.
Restaurant - You cannot use forks and knives here. If you don't like using hands then not the right place to be. You will be given a bib because the hands get dirty and you may spill while eating crabs. Overall food was good. Bathroom wasn't clean and no toilet papers.
Overall experience - Once in a blue moon nice set of place to hang out with friends and enjoy the talks and music in background.< /Review>

The food is decent like every other crawfish/crab boil type place but the wait is insane. I don't think it's worth the wait at all.<//review>

<Review>I got King Crab and shrimp with the whole shaving sauce. Crab was good, sauce is too much for me. Had my stomach upset. I didn't like the shrimp because they was not clean. I dont want to eat poop. Wasted 20.00 because the shrimp came with corn,  potatoe and sausage. Well I had 2 slices of sausage. A little disappointed. I spent a lot and was not happy. Will not be going back.</Review>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>The best spicy crab around for miles. I drive 35min regularly cuz we are addicted. I promise u will ♥ it!
Only downfall is no outside food/drinks allowed. I always bring my own cold Pepsi & they make me throw it away. I am willing to buy a Pepsi from them so it sucks to have to throw away money to spend a ton of money. They are the only place i go that won't allow my Pepsi. Lame. Food is worth it tho.< /Text>< pictures>

The food was good, but here's the problems. 1) The order came in multiple trips instead of just 1 trip from the kitchen. 2) We had multiple servers for our table instead of just the server who took our order. 3) The music was blasted so loud I could barely hear anyone at my table. Not recommended.< /Review>

<pics>None<//pics><Review>I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. The food here is good but our orders kept getting mixed up with another table. Although it was confusing, it worked out and my table got our food. We even received extra food but we decided to be honest about it (not without a few fries and shrimp missing). I would recommend looking into what kind of crab is in season if that's your game but even though you dont' want to pay for king crab, it will be the most bang for your buck. The shrimp was good with only a couple of not completely cleaned ones. That shabang sauce is amazing! The corn was definitely not up to par though.< /Review>< Time>

<review>The food was tasty. The plastic utensils broke easily. The service was fairly attentive, but the waitress who described the hottest sauce as Siracha like was wrong. When she was confronted about this and we shared that we were displeased about the one order (out of 5) She refused to remake it and said they could add butter. I will probably give them another shot someday, but the person who was not offered a new dish will never return. Seems like it would have been worth the $9 worth of crawfish to keep his business and have my family and I visit again sooner.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>It's a popping place. Lots of locals seem yo attend here. Lunch was busy. I though it was ok. The corn is over priced. One is like 1.25, the food was ok. The flavor was ok. Nothing that wowed me really. Like the idea of it and I love seafood, but it wasn't something mind. Also be careful walking outside the doors of the complex goes out and some people can possibly hit you as your walking to the boiling crab. Trust me it hurt lol. The place is large and is good for all group sizes. They offer sausages and rice in our separate from your order. I like to order the corn and put it in the bag to soak the flavor. Try it out. You might like it more than me. 😀<//review><time>1499647965005< /time><GmapID>0x809ac56fa4e33517:0x7e5d76b14f7f8976<//GmapID>< Response>

I've heard so many things about this place and finally after years of wanting to try it I finally did. All the anticipation was for a disappointing meal. I was let down majorly first arriving I really liked it the vibe, music,decor, didn't like the TV's tho they have a bunch of 27 in TV's all lined up instead of big ones idk y . As far as the food it looks better then it tastes. It looks like there's lots of season in it but it's flavorless. Seafood is my favorite food in the whole world . I've are many places in many states so I feel I know what I'm talking about, also I love to eat my shellfish with melted butter and maybe a lil garlic salt or something. So I asked the waiter for sum butter and gross it was pure oil me and my sister are there and had a beer each spent around 90 bucks I wouldn't recommend<//text>

Food is really tasty. The wait time to be seated horrible over a hour. Small children can't bring in outside food as well. Not all kids like seafood.</Review>

<review>Went there for the first time on Saturday (11/16/2013) and loved it!! Its soooo messy but oh sooooooo good!!! My Daughter and I shared and still had left overs! We got 1 lbs of shrimp, 1/2 lbs sausage and 2 corns in the cajun and garlic butter sauce. All for under $18.00! That was lunch and dinner for us. We cant wait to go back!! =-)< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Everytime I went to California I always thought of this place. Last time I visit, they expand the place so is the price. I know its market value but only once I saw the price went down.< /Text>

This place is for cajun and seafood lovers who have groups of friends that want to join. It's usually a fun time and the food is good. I like the oysters, cajun and sweet potato fries, and whole she-bang shrimp. The shrimp are not de-veined though and your fingers smell like garlic for a while after eating. The wait also makes the experience worse. I think this particular location has worse service than the SoCal ones and it is slightly more expensive. At least its next to vampire penguin so you can get shaved snow after and shop for Asian food beforehand!< /Text>

Good food but extremely long waits during the weekend. Make sure you put your name down on the waiting list and hang out in the area because it could be a 1-2 hour wait.< /Review>

Wait was shorter than expected.
Dinner made up for that time saved as dinner delayed. Had to get manager involved, part of order was significantly delayed, rest of table done with dinner and still waiting on items that were same as another party at our table. Although a credit was added, extremely overpriced. Similar meal over 150 less at similar establishment and better service.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Good taste, good price. $ 15 a pound of shrimp. But there is a waiting list, sometimes up to 2 hours or more.

(Translated by Google) The truth is that this place treated us too badly, we were 16 people who were visiting us for the first time they made us wait for 2 and a half hours, and they told us to wait another 45 minutes for this it was already 8 o'clock at night and they had up to 4 tables alone, but small groups passed the truth that I never go back to this place but we went to the crazy chicken better

(Original)
La verdad este lugar nos trató demasiado mal,éramos 16   personas que lo vicitabamos por primera vez nos hicieron esperar por 2 horas y media ,y nos dijeron que esperáramos otros 45 minutos para esto ya eran las 8 de la noche y abeses tenían asta 4 mesas solas,pero pasaban grupos pequeños     la verdad que nunca buelvo a ir a este lugar    pero nos fuimos al pollo loco mejor< /text>
