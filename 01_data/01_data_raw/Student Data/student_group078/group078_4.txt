<text>Good food! Lovely atmosphere! We were able to have our dog with us which was so nice and they even brought out a bowl of water for her! The chai was mild and sweet, but very enjoyable. The staff were so helpful, especially the sweet lady who was cleaning off the tables, I did not get her na.. Will absolutely come back!</text>< pictures>

What a cute place in the middle of a quaint residential neighborhood. I had the green machine juice and a breakfast sandwich. Both delish!< /text>

Good little place in a converted gas station. Order at the counter, food brought to you outside. (No inside seating.)

Had a turkey, bacon, and avocado sandwich -- very good.< /Text>

Looking for a good brunch spot, I came across this place with the beautiful rainbow lattes and had to try it. My fiance and I got the stuffed french toast, breakfast burrito, and rainbow latte during our visit. Overall everything was pretty good! I enjoyed the orange marmalade that was added to the french toast and the fresh strawberries on top. The breakfast burrito was juicy and they had a fabulous salsa to go with it. The rainbow latte was gorgeous but tasted like a normal latte - it's more to visually enjoy and get your Instagram picture. The food was good, but the price ($50 for two people, including tip) was a bit high.

You order your food at the counter inside and then you have the option of taking it to go or eating on the patio. The patio was a bit on the crowded side, even on a Monday morning, and you choose your own seat rather than being told where to sit. I felt there wasn't quite enough distance among the tables and would have preferred if the employees chose seats for the customers. They provided hand sanitizer at the register and at each table which was great!</Text>

Great atmosphere. Good food. I expected more of a sit down restaurant. Reality is that it is an indoor grill and market with outdoor seating. The food was good and very filling. The outdoor seating area is very peaceful.  All in all  a nice place to eat and hang out.< /review>

A nice place to have lunch. Menu is typical above-average sandwiches and other lunch items, portion sizes are larger, and prices are also a bit high ($16 for a good sized sandwich and a good amount of French fries. Nothing special, but it's tucked away, so I would go for the scenery and change of atmosphere more than because of the food.<//Text>

cozy restaurant and cute outdoor seating - quite a few vegan options! had the vegan impossible burger which was alright but could have had much more flavor. same applies to the garlic spread - it was almost potato-y and not at all similar to what I expected it to taste like (lebanese/ mediterranean garlic spread - thoum) but it came with a hefty amount of fries which was great (;< /review>

I am in love with this unexpected little restaurant occupying an old gas station in the Glendale hills. The menu puts a foodie spin on classic and simple favorites like grilled cheese, etc. I got the pear and Gorgonzola salad and it was delicious (and huge). My friend got the Brussel sprouts and they were super tasty too! This is super great experience and I highly recommend Wild Oak Cafe.< /text>

We came across this place last year, I believe through Yelp or something because my husband recommended it .... Did not disappoint! My nephew's loved it and it was the most beautiful brunch under the rain we could've had. This time we went back during a sunny day and it is gorgeous as well. The location is beautiful, the place is really clean and the food is delicious 🤤 loved our stuffed French toast, our breakfast sandwich, the chicken and waffles. Their orange juice is freshly squeezed and the coffee is soooo good too!

My husband and I came here on Veteran's Day for brunch for the first time. I ordered the portobello burger with chips that they make there and a hot spiced chai latte. My husband ordered the crispy chicken sandwich with fries and an Arnold Palmer. We were very satisfied with the food and the location and the atmosphere of the restaurant. We can't wait to go back and try more food options.</Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>I mean the place is nice, the vibe is great and is perfect to eat and have a nice mountain view, hard for any other breakfast restaurant to beat that location. Why 4 out of 5? The food is very good, NOT amazing but good enough, also is way overpriced, 1 normal size tuna sandwich and sprite almost 21$??? Are you serious????? and they also expect a tip, I only go there when I need a quiet place to relax and eat.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I wanted to try to like this place as it came up on a search.  When I called, one of the young ladies stated that it would be a 30-40min wait if I headed out there. so I thought I'd give it a try anyway.

As we stood in line and proceeded to order, we were told it would be a 30min wait for food if we chose take-out or 30min more or less if we chose to stay and wait for a table.

We waited over an hour. 80 minutes to be precise before we even got our food.

Did I fail to mention that none of the employees check on the outside tables as people come and go?  I would think that they would at least try to check and ask the patrons if they needed assistance or to clean the tables.

The tables themselves aren't quite following the 6ft apart rule.

At this point, we waited so long that their service wasn't as adequate as I thought they'd be.

They need to and should start a wait list for people to be seated... especially on weekends.  I get it... it's a small business, but they need to keep it together.

I know I'll be taking my business elsewhere.  This does not seem like it is well run.  I've been to other establishments that are more truthful and honest about their wait times.  Oh, and those businesses have wait lists through yelp.

One good thing they have going for them is the hand sanitizer at each table.< /Text>

<review>Not we'll run during the covid pandemic. Tables are a free for all. Nobody attending for cleaning. Definitely not 6' apart. Water station available for everyone outside, clean hands or not. Was told it would be a 30 minute wait for food, took over an hour. Food is not spectacular. Soggy waffle and a rather small breakfast burrito for the price.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>My husband and I had breakfast twice here during a recent trip, and it was really good both times. Service was friendly and efficient, they had a nice variety of food and beverages available, and the food was great. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, although indoor seating can get a bit crowded during busy times. A nice, calm spot in a busy area.< /text>< user_name>

I guess I just love to drive around the canyon road a lot, and it happens that at the foot of the winding road, there would be a good place to eat and feel that breeze of peace. It's like a little escape from the hectic city life.<//text>

Little on the expensive side for lunch but definitely worth for the taste. Try chicken and waffles with spicy maple syrup is good. Portobello burger tastes good too. Can also get good Groupon deals for this place.< /Review>

At long last and after a pretty long ride (or at least longer than i thought it would be) up Chevy Chase, i made it to the Wild Oak Cafe.
It was a cool sunny morning.  my Starbucks was packed and i had just done some shopping for Christmas dinner (and no it is not too early to begin prep) and then i thought about the Wild Oak.
In any event, I opened the door to this establishment and was greeted by the nice, welcoming face of Miss Ashley who took my order, made my coffee and helped me to figure out the 1/2 and 1/2 dispenser. We also chatted about family, the drive up, the impending Holidays. In other words, her service was super personal and as sunny as the day outside. Corny? Yes but a nice change from frowny, unpleasant service people which seems to be the norm rather than the exception.
The head cook (did not get his name) brought my food over to me and asked if he could bring something else plus he asked me if everything was good as i walked out the door. Good attitude.
The physical plant is well kept, very clean: and this includes the large outdoor patio as well as the smaller area inside.
Decoration is minimal: limited to paint and good furniture both of which seem new and/or well maintained.
There are about 6 parking places right next to the Cafe and there looks to be plenty of street parking.
I ordered:
a Breakfast Bowl
a Cuppa Joe (Peets)
The secret behind producing a good bowl is harder than you might think. All layers must be flavor forward and sit in the bowl in a place where they cannot be overpowered by what is below or on top.
This Breakfast Bowl had fried (as in from the fryer i think) well seasoned potato chunks as a base and they were cooked perfectly and stayed crisp the whole time i was eating.
There were also Scrambled eggs, Bacon, bell pepper, onions, mushrooms, fire roasted Salsa plopped on top as well in 1/4 of a sliced fresh Avocado.
The least successful piece of the bowl were the eggs which were left too long in the pan and therefore a bit stiff and dry. Not bad but not great.
The Salsa (made in house) was tasty and not spicy which was a minor disappointed. Also next time i would order it on the side as it is wet and could soak into the other ingredients.
The fresh, sliced Avocado was a nice foil to the salsa and the other ingredients. This bowl was very good not great.
The coffee was excellent: well brewed and tasty.
I barely touched the depth of their menu but based on this item and the super good service i look forward to returning to the Wild Oak.< /text>

The steak cilantro salad was unfortunately quite bitter and tasteless. Bitter lettuce, dressing tasted like spinach. For the $17 I paid, it was not worth it. Generous portion sizes though.< /review>

Great little spot for breakfast and lunch nestled into Chevy Chase Canyon. The spot used to be a drive through dairy. The food is very fresh and the service is pretty good. You order at the register and then they bring you your food. That is the extent of the service. I would give 5 stars except that the food is a little on the pricey side and so the value is a little off. Otherwise, the locale almost makes you for it.< /Review>

Simply amazing place. In the hills on the quiet side. Service was awesome and food was spectacular! Just like the picture! They serve beer and burgers. The seating is outside only but the weather up there early morning or afternoon is great. Very calm and wonderful place for a date or a simple outing.<//text>

<Time>1562069639233</Time><Review>It's a cute cafe the salads are fresh and delicious keep in mind this is the only thing I've had. The ride coming here is a awesome it's a beautiful road to travel. The restaurant is located on Chevy Chase familiar with Glendale it's a nice location and as I mentioned a awesome ride to travel.

Hope you enjoy it .

The only thing I didn't like because I have to go to the counter and order your food. They expect you to tip
them prior to receiving your food.
I don't tip until I receive my food and see the kind of service they provide. This was my first time here I was not impressed with the delay of the food so that's why I gave him a 4. It's nothing like someone coming to your table and taking the order.

The salads are  $17 but you're paying for the unique location. Is she all I really hungry this will not feel you up so I ask for sandwiches as well.< /Review><username>Ladyinred Love<//username>< response>

Long wait (was told 30 min and waited for 1 hour), tables are not even attempting to be 6 feet apart. Food was overpriced for its quality, which is passable at best at best.<//Review>

Its tucked away near some beautiful homes between Pasadena and Glendale. They converted an old gas station to this little cafe, with a charming seating area outside where the pumps used to be. The food is great, the drinks are great, and they serve good Turkish Coffee, which is always a plus!< /Text>< user_name>

This cute, what looks like an old gas station converted into a cafe, is perfect little place to get some good food. It has become my wife's and myself new favorite place for breakfast. They are also open for lunch.

My suggestion for breakfast is the breakfast bowls. Really good and tasty. Really reasonable size for the price.

The seating is outside where the gas pumps would of been. The cafe sits next to a golf course. During a nice day it really enjoyable to sit outside and enjoy your food.</text>

A Bit expensive with little justification.  $17 small steak salad... and your still are still hungry. Not chef quality. But good food. Maybe their rent is high.< /Review>

<review>This is a great little place tucked in the Chevy Chase canyon. They have a lot of great selections for breakfast or lunch. Their chicken and waffles are great, so are their burgers and beer battered sidewinder fries! Great coffee choices and they are one of the few places with amazing cronuts. They get a bit busy for brunch on the weekends so come early or expect a little wait.<//review><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2c22881a3eecd:0x833711ea797a0a4< /gmap_id></record>

<text>The cafe was a nice surprise. A friend and I biked there for breakfast. The menu is posted on the wall in a large, easy to read print, listing ingredients and prices. I ordered the breakfast bowl, which was delicious, but way more than I could eat. I easily could have split it with my friend. Both of us had leftovers! I thought the prices were very fair, especially because the food was plentiful and delicious. The only thing I would improve is the cleanliness of the eating area. It is outside and the seat cushions looked filthy and the tables felt dirty.  The employee washing the tables used a dirty rag which basically just pushed the dirt around instead of really cleaning the tables. I will definitely go back for the excellent food but I recommend a lesson in cleaning to the staff working there!</text>< Pics>

<Review>I wasn't sure what to expect as we pulled up to this place. A tiny building with some outside seating in the middle of a neighborhood. We walked inside and were greeted by a nice woman who took our order. I had a burrito and my GF had the avocado toast. Both were great and I'd recommend this cool spot.<//Review>< gmapID>

Very tasty and tender ribeye sandwich. Stuffed French toast was nice. A nice place to get away from the city street scene .. You know the hustle bustle busses, buildings, parking garages, etc. I only wish they had real dishware rather than disposable ware.<//text>

We went for lunch. The service is friendly and nice.. but it an ok place with ok food. Too hot to sit outside. A water fountain or some mist fan would be nice. They could improve the look of the area. Maybe we will go back for breakfast when the weather is cooler.</review>

<Text>So glad my friend told me about this place because I wouldn't have come across it otherwise. It's right by the Chevy Chase Country Club and in a beautiful residential area. There is plenty of outdoor seating and heaters so we were able to sit outside on a cold day. They serve Peet's Coffee and my cappuccino was good. I loved my breakfast bowl. It was delicious and they listened to my requests of what to leave out. I definitely plan on going back and trying the waffles next time. The only thing I would change is maybe adding some light background music outside so it's not super quiet out there but otherwise loved everything.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>What a fun place nestled in the Flintridge Hills in a neighborhood of large homes, you would never expect to find this 1950’s has station building turned into a wonderful cafe. The food is good and so are the pastries.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>A 50/50 place. Looks great and the food is ok but too overpriced. The service also deserves improvement, long wait time and if you charge 15 bucks for a simple sandwich, at least serve it on a normal plate with a choice of sides not on a paper one with barely edible chips as a single option.
The coffee is completely terrible.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< time>

<Review>A small but  comfortable spot to stop for breakfast or lunch. Most of the seating is outdoors on the covered patio (the road noise can get a little loud). The breakfast burrito was packed with flavor and super tasty ... though a little on the small size.< /Review><user_id>117806518920761852131</user_id><pics>None< /pics><Date>1460224174467</Date>< Gmap_id>

I gave this place a five because I love the secluded location in Chevy Chase canyon next to the golf course. With the seating outside and a quiet atmosphere it's great. I've only had iced americanos and hot americanos and some cambucha of which all I enjoyed. I decided to rate at a 5 for the experience I have drinking coffee there. I don't have any complaints<//text>

<Review>Eric made our food- So fresh and yummy. Gevive took care of us very nicely. We sat out the open area. Years were on. It was pleasant. Rainy and wet out but pretty cozy in.

Later we met Susanna who along with hubby Vahagn Gevorgyan ran this cafe for the past two years. So much so that the second cafe will open in mid month in Van Nuys federal buildibgs.

Haik and Kayla prepared our coffee and in all we had a great visit. The WiFi is free and the cafe is rated "A" by the county's heath.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. It was overpriced at $14.00 and was burnt on one side. I had been wanting to try this place for awhile. Very disappointing.  I probably won't be back.< /Text><user_name>Janet H</user_name>< Rate>

< Review>
Real life savers. They were getting close to closing on Saturday, and suggested I come back Monday morning. But when they realized I was on a cycle tour and would be stuck in a motel until then they chased me down as I was leaving and put two men on the job to get my trike's shifting tuned up perfect and back on the road. As well as kind advice on the best route to the ocean, and offers of water, use of their restroom, anything they could do to help. Thank you very much, fellas.< /Review>

<date>1619821876084< /date><text>This is where you want to go.

Very friendly atmosphere with many people available to help.

Made an appointment to have my bike service, chain replaced, new tires installed, and the derailed fixed.

Dropped it off on the day of the appointment and 5 hours later Joel called and said it was ready! He even replaced a dropper post cable for free that he felt was needed and didn’t even ask me about it.

Bike is working super well! Just rode at Greer yesterday and I felt like it was a brand new bike.</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>What a great selection! We stopped in looking for a solid bike for our soon-to-be 5 year-old for his birthday and happily left with an awesome Cannondale. The sales associate Phil was super helpful and calm as we looked at all options. If you're in the inland North County or Oceanside area, this is the spot for bikes. Thank you Bike Shop crew!<//text>< GmapID>

This shop is awesome! I was out shredding trails at Vail this morning and snapped my Nukeproof Mega Pro 29er derailleur in half. I went straight to the bike shop and Tyler and Sean took care of me. I upgraded to a better derailleur and Sean had my bike fixed the same day! Dude is a master mechanic. Tyler also took care of me when I bought a Specialized Rockhopper from the shop a couple months ago. Dudes are way knowledgeable. They also offer military discounts on everything! Great shop, great staff!< /review>

I wanted to take time out to thank Chad and everyone else at The Bike Shop on the Temecula Parkway. Chad was very patient and took his time to make sure I got the right bike and accessories. Everyone at this shop including the owner is so kind and helpful. I love my new specialized Roubaix Road Bike!<//Review>

Went in there for help with my bike tires. Unfortunately,  the tires I required for my bike is an odd ball size. Sean and some of the crew took the time to research and find the tires I required.  They went above and beyond to help me. Thanks fellas I really appreciate it.</Review>

<review>If you ever had a wheelie-terrible bike fix like mine, these folks would get you rolling again.

I first talked to Billy on the phone, he was helpful with my DIY screwup and eager to get to me riding.  The shop was buzzing at the door, but I met Phil and Jan, both accommodating, funny, kind, and once again, eager to get me riding. I didn’t meet Jon L, but kudos to him for taking the time to examine my DIY front derailleur adjustment snafu and fix it up so I could ride out the door.

This place is all about getting folks riding and having fun. It is THE bike shop to go to in Temecula.< /review>< Response>

Just had a fantastic experience at the Bile Shop!  Purchased a bike for my daughter, the staff was super helpful in making sure the size was right and allowed her to do a quick test ride.  Beyond that the sale person that helped me was extremely friendly and a pleasure to work with.  Prior to this I picked up a new tire and tube for another bike and had an equally good experience.  Thank you!<//text>

I came in not knowing anything about biking and with just a few questions and some info and then handled every thing I threw at them, let my test ride, and even held the bike til I came back an hour or so later. Great customer service and information handling. Definitely recommend if you've never been.</review>

<Text>I was on a bike ride on Saturday, June 13, 2020 and I knew I was going to be passing The Bike Shop so I decided to stop in to see if I could get my tires pumped up and schedule an appointment for my brakes to be adjusted later. When I arrived the shop was busy as usual but the employees made a point to pump up my tires and suggested looking at the brakes. They decided they’d make time to adjust them right then so I gladly waited and was in an out of the Bike Shop in record time. I’ve found and purchased all the necessary items I’ve needed for my bike at the Bike Shop and the employees have installed everything from a bike rack to locks, mirrors, a cell phone holder, and more. I’ve received the best service and care that any bike shop could ever give. There’s never a need to go anyplace else. We’re lucky to have the Bike Shop here in Temecula!!< /Text><userid>116832141543133831746</userid><response>{'time': 1592526905255, 'text': 'Wow thank you for the positive feedback!

This is a fantastic establishment that I've been going to for many years. The mechanics are all top-notch not just in terms of their skill and customer service but the fact that they really are interested you and how to help you enjoy the sport even more. Wouldn't take my bikes anywhere else!<//text>

Went to this store before my weekly Tuesday ride without any appointment because my bike has some problems with its chain and front derailleur and they were able to fix it on time for my Tuesday ride, John the bike mechanic/technician is awesome and friendly and so as the rest of the staff.<//review>

<Time>1595891344384< /Time><Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Overall good customer service. Just slightly disappointed with the result of what I got back. Took my bike in for kind of an overall checkup, main point being brakes, wheels, shocks and shifters. Paid just over 100 bucks to have my shifters cleaned and a new chain. Which I was fine with. But they took my front wheel off and when i got it back it no longer spins freely. My back brakes squeal like crazy, which was there before but I would've hoped they addressed it and my back tire has cracks in it and needs to be replaced. I don't know much about bikes which is why I wasn't specific in my repair requests, just hoped that with their experience they would have noticed these things. Anyhow, the work they did was great and now I know for next time to be specific.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>This Bike Shop is AMAZING! I’m new to the whole bike world. Just purchased a bike from offer up and the person I purchased it from told me the bike might need a new chain. So I stopped at The Bike Shop and the nicest young man walked out to help me right away. Asked me what I needed help with and I honestly didn’t know what to answer since I was only told it could need a new chain. He said “no worries, let me check it for you and we can figure it out”. 10 minutes later comes back and tells me the bike didn’t need a chain, they put some air in the tires, fixed a few things that were rubbing against the wheel and a few other things they tuned up. I was so blown away and asked him how much I owed him and he said NOTHING 😳! I was so blown away by that because I’m so new to this and he knew it and the fact that they had integrity and were so honest about the bike not needed anything, truly said it all. What an amazing honest young man and bike shop. I would totally recommend this place to everyone. Besides supporting our local businesses during this time is what it’s about, specially when they’re so nice and honest!< /review><resp>None< /resp>< user>

I stopped in to grab a few things I needed for my bike.
I came in at 5:30 and they close at 6pm. I had asked about how much a repair to my back rim for a broken spoke would cost, not expecting it to be able to be worked on during this visit. But, too my surprise the guy's offered to fix it tonight if I would be able to wait a little bit for the repair. These guy's are awesome they stayed late to fix my bike like they had known me for year's. There's other bike shops closer to my house, but I will be passing all of them to come here. I've been blown away by there customer service and dedication. Thanks again All. 👍<//Text>

TBS Temecula is a great bike shop. They have incredible staff, and great mechanics.  They always go above and beyond to help customers. They are also active in the community.  They host great rides.  They exemplify what a local bike shop should be.</text>

<Text>The Bike Shop went above and beyond to repair our bike when we didn’t have an appointment and just brought it in on a busy Saturday. They’ve also assembled a scooter for us and their work and customer service is always top-notch. We purchased two bikes from them a few years back and The Bike Shop stands behind the products they sell and the work they do. They are an awesome small business and I highly recommend them.</Text></record>

<text>I’m so happy that The Bike Shop here is Temecula is my LBS (local bike ship). All of the people that I have dealt with at the shop are courteous and professional. Joe, the manager, has always gone out of my way to assist me in whatever I had going on. Salespersons Phil and Randy have been so helpful when I’m shopping for something. John and Shawn in the service department have been great in taking care of my bike (2017 Specialized Roubaix Pro). I have taken care of my own bike for decades, partly to save money but mainly for lack of trust of anyone else touching my bike. With that being said, I am happy to say that I am completely at ease trusting my bike to this shop.

More specifically, Joe helped me get warranty work for my front DI2 derailleur even though I did not purchase the bike from them. He has provided reasonable prices for Specialized parts when I have needed/wanted them (new rear wheel, power cranks, DI2 ANT transmitter). John has been great explaining what was going on with my bike and in discussing my options. Extremely helpful.

I wish all businesses were like this one!<//text><rating>5<//rating><username>Alan Baba< /username><user>105766631878342655248< /user>< GmapID>

It's all crew is awesome the always treat me well. They go the extra mile and make sure everything's done right. If you need a shop that won't rip your head off and I'll make sure you're dialed in you gotta take your bike to these guys. If you're looking for a bike I need to talk to and experience Rider These guys have tons of experience  And Passion for the ride.
You won't be  Disappointed.<//text>

Update: had my third visit because I couldn't figure out what was wrong with my jogger cycle.

I had a stuck free wheel mechanism on my wheel that i had been trying to get off. i didn't have a vice and ruined my free wheel removal tool with an adjustable wrench. John at The Bike Shop helped me out and was able to get off the free wheel for me in less than a minute without charge. These guys are great! I'll be sure to come back to get my other bikes serviced here.</Text>

<Text>Jake is the man. Everybody at the shop is friendly, responsive, and was wearing a MASK (handouts at the front door). Within 15 minutes of puncturing my tire with a screw, I was out the door with a new inner tube, tire, and even a courtesy water.

I love mom/ pop shops. I'm a healthcare worker. I stopped in a few weeks ago to check out this shop. I came in today to make some big purchases. I was looking for a E-bike for my wife and a new mountain bike for myself. The worker Alex seemed ok but he was helping another customer. I was helped, not really, by this other guy who came by and asked what I was looking for. Told him I was looking for a couple bikes but he didn't seem too interested in selling me bikes. It was like pulling teeth just to get him to explain to me e-bikes and differences in the bikes I was checking out. The Giant brand bikes I was looking at had two different prices. But again it was like he couldn't tell me straight why the other one cost less. Then when I finally got him to tell me it was because one had disc brakes and the other had regular brakes. I was more interested in the disc braked one and asked him do you have it in black, since the one I like was a silver one. He told me the other one is black. Duh, I know that, but I wanted a disc braked one in black. He looked at me perplexed. Then when I asked about helmets he nonchalantly pointed me in the direction of the helmets. Coming back to the bike I was interested in I asked him if I could test the bike. He asked me am I buying it, otherwise I can't test it. I should've left right then and there but like I said I been to this shop before and that bike caught my eye plus it took me half hour from Lake Elsinore to get there so I didn't want to leave empty handed.  Needless to say I caved and bought the bike but I was willing to drop 3 grand on merchandise and the customer service flat out sucked. I will never go back to this place and let others in the medical field who are interested in new rides to not go there either. I found a great bike place off of Newport Ave with awesome customer service. My wife bought a better e-bike later today than the one I was looking at here and the service is so much better. They fitted her, let her ride the bike to see if she liked how it felt.  Now that's top notch service.  I know times are tough right now, but c'mon this is ridiculous. I should return this bike because I haven't experienced poor customer service like this in ages. With so many people being laid off/ fired. This guy should be appreciative he has a job. I'd put zero stars or 1/2 a star but it won't let me.</Text>

Some days I'm not heading home till 1:30am. One night/very early morning, I found my rear wheel stolen. A few months later, my seat and seat post were stolen. Sometimes my derailleurs had been messed with while the thieves tried to steal other parts. The customer service and bike mechanics here are some of the best and most down to earth. They'll help you find what products best fit your situation with your ride, plus give you amazing service on your bicycle.

<Text>Great service and prices! I was having a heck of time installing a new Manitou fork and removing an old crown race.  The service team was able to help me out and get me back on the dirt same day.  I have purchased a new bike and two helmets at The Bike Shop over the past month, so I definitely appreciate a local shop that appreciates my business and will do me a solid when I'm in a bind.< /Text>< pictures>

Not thrilled with the level of service. Claimed I was to blame, but no evidence to support that. Typically the LBS has your back, might as well go Big Box Chain at this rate, prices are better.< /Text>

I see that ratings are good but just from my experience alone, the customer service was not good. Walked in, stated I had questions about a few bikes, and waited sometime before I just decided to walk out. In their defense, I did notice an individual on the floor assisting someone while I was there but I also noticed a few other employees standing around talking to each other. I don’t do good or bad reviews but from having customer service experience, my experience was not great. I’ll make a purchase elsewhere.< /Text>

This has become one of my favorite places to shop, in general. While it's only a bike store, the customer service makes you wish they did everything. But, whether purchasing a bike, gear, supplements, etc., Or your current bike needs service, this is the shop to go to if you are anywhere in the vicinity. Knowledge beyond measure of any style bike for any purpose, a drive to get your bike back on the road better than before and a great source for local riding information.< /Text>

I am closer to two other shops but my wife and I still drive down to this place. They never try to sell me things I don't need, the give honest feedback on products and backup what they sell. They have even let me use a loaner wheel and gave an extended time to try a new seat, which was awesome. You really can't go wrong! Lastly, the weekly shop rides are great, with an option to suit anyone's level.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>After calling several places to replace a tire tube and pedals, this location was able to do same day service, which actually took 20 minutes to complete. Other places I spoke to via telephone seemed to be stressed out and said they couldn't get it done today. When I walked into the place, I was greeted with smiles and was directed to the back service area. They appeared to be busy with many bicycles they were servicing, but since I was there for a simple tire tube and pedal changed they helped me out quick (simple for them not me).. I appreciate the excellent work and kindness. I highly recommend this bicycle shop for all biking/service needs.</Text>< Pics>

The staff is absolutely amazing! I bought my first bike from here. I walked in a little hesitant, but within minutes the very knowledgeable and friendly sales rep helped me find a bike for my needs. After a long day of going from bike shop to bike shop it was refreshing to come into a parlor where they had women's bikes in colors other than pink and purple. They have a spacious parking lot right behind their store with little to no traffic that facilitates test rides.  When she was about to ring me up my friend jokingly  asked if we qualified for any discounts and she instantly saved us $70. I highly recommend The Bike Shop.< /Review>

<review>I didn't buy my bike here at The Bike Shop. I actually bought it across town about 5 or 6 years ago. Even still, The Bike Shop has serviced my bike, and my son's bike, very quickly on multiple occassions. 3 times they have done instant service. They have reasonable prices, and I appreciate how they have treated me. I plan to buy a new bike soon, and I wouldn't go anywhere else.</review><user>111582491554330657750<//user>< gmapID>

I told them I couldn't afford all of it and I just wanted the chain replaced right now and they then tried to man handle me into paying them the entire couple hundred dollars by saying they'd only do all of the work or nothing. I argued with them for a little while asking them to please replace my chain, but they refused to do the small job and kept trying to upsell me on the couple hundred dollar repairs. So, I had to leave the store without my bike chain replaced. I even called before coming in to make sure they'd have the chain and could install it. I felt very taken advantage of and like I'd been at a cheap used car sales lot.   I will never waste my time here again and I recommend you don't either.</Review></record></dataset><record>

We had the omakase here. It was really well done. It was enough food to leave you satisfied. The fish was fresh and well seasoned but not overly so that it overpowered the seafood flavor.

Service was great, very attentive.

Corkage was reasonable at $25< /review>

Decided to try their omakase after reading the reviews here. Unfortunately, the food was very mediocre. The portions are good and will leave you filled, but the quality of the fish is not consistent. They do have a good selection of a la carte dishes, I’d say that’s probably a better way to go than having the omakase.<//text>

<Text>I got the Omakase and it was just ok. The rice was not the greatest consistency, but the fish to rice ratio was good. Felt like the fish was average quality cuts. Decent but nothing particularly memorable or outstanding.</Text>< Pictures>

I LOVE this place, and the sushi* is fantastic!

*To be fair, every time I come to this place, I go for the omakase menu, sitting at the bar, so it's mostly the nigiri portions.

Let me explain the method, introduced to me by one of my friends.
You sit at the bar so you can see the sushi prepared. You can hear the story behind it. You can talk to the chef Jacky (who is an amazing and hilarious guy) and learn a bit about the amount of work that goes into these small portions of fish. Share some sake, and you will forget that you are in a restaurant and imagine heaven made of sushi (the best type of heaven, of course).
I've been here several times, and this formula (omakase at the bar) never fails. Just let the chef take care of you, you are in good hands.< /Text>

Good sushi and good atmosphere. The Chef's special role was great. Service was a bit confused; it seemed like the staff were not sure who was taking care of us. The food came quickly and I'd say the quality was average. Price was a little high given the average quality.<//Review>

This place was amazing, amazing! The food quality is great and the service was outstanding. Food is delicious, wouldn't recommend the pricing if you are on a tight budget... but I consider the pricing OK, it is San Francisco after all. We jumped in almost at their closing hour and they welcomed us with a smile. It was my mom's birthday and their customer service was on point. Whenever I'm in SFO again, I'm definitely stopping by!< /review>

<rate>2</rate><review>Fish was old, chef was tenderizing fish that should not need it and the Otorii did not melt as it should in part because it not well selected (marbling looked closer to wagyu that otoro) and in part because he sliced too close to the tough skin, leaving gristly bits. In general, the chef had poor attention to detail and was serving cuts I am more likely to see at cheap sushi joints.

There are plenty of quality sushi options around this area. I would recommend against spending your money here.

Atmosphere, service and tea were good.</review></record></dataset><record>

This was our first visit for dinner, and we had such a great time! Firstly, we were delighted by the "Sushi Tapas" part of the menu, which is not a concept I've heard of before but is great. We tried the Albacore Tataki and the Salmon 5 Ways from that part and enjoyed both very much for the exceptional flavors and quality of fish.

We also ordered the Secret Roll because it was the Chef's Special, and we figured it's probably featuring seasonal fish or flavor combinations we wouldn't have thought to order ourselves. I'm not sure what secrets were in that roll, but it was quite delicious!

We were sitting at the sushi counter, so after our starters, we just ordered a specific number of nigiri and had the chefs pick out the best ones. It was all so delicious. Plus, we learned all kinds of stuff about the differences in growing regions, why you prepare sushi different ways, and best of all, new kinds of fish that we really like and will order in the future.

We had a fabulous experience and look forward to returning! I highly recommend checking this out, especially if you're in the mood for good sushi.< /text>

Really  not good. The fish was deeply suspect - as in old. The rice not good. The service terrible.  The beverages non-existent - no beer, sake, wine, only ice tea, pellegrino or tap water. I get that this place just opened but....wow.< /review>

My friends and I sorely miss Minas Brazilian Restaurant and Canto do Brasil, both of which occupied this location for many years. The Japanese restaurant that replaced those Brazilian places, Nakama, is conveniently located by the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, where we had concert tickets, so we decided to give it a try.

Before dining at Nakama, we decided to read all the reviews appearing in three of the major social media and restaurant sites where San Francisco diners tend to post their impressions. We were pleasantly surprised to see that substantial numbers of reviews had already been written for this restaurant that has been open for less than 6 months.

The gist of the reviews seemed to center around two general opinions: (1) the first part of the menu, containing appetizers and tapas had some superb choices; (2) the second part, containing the nigiri and sashimi offerings, did not receive as many accolades, possibly related to the fact that much of the raw fish is shipped to Nakama from far away Japan.

Unlike some of the critical reviews we read, mostly from the early months of this restaurant, we found the service at Nakama to be excellent. We informed our server that we had an 8 PM concert to attend and she made sure that the chef kept our multiple courses arriving in a timely fashion.

Our only service complaint is that we requested miso soup to start but, just as we read in two other reviews, the miso soup never arrived. That said, we were charged for it!

Based on the accolades of prior reviewers, here is what we ordered to build our own personalized tasting menu: grilled live scallop, vegetable gyoza, sake steam clams, Gindara miso black cod, ½ dozen oysters, and eggplant on a skewer. Every one of these plates was superb. Thank you fellow Nakama reviewers!

We also ordered 1 Hamachi nigiri and 1 Hamachi sashimi. It should be noted that you only get ONE nigiri or sashimi per order, not two like you often receive at other sushi restaurants. My dining companion said his Hamachi nigiri tasted OK to him. My Hamachi sashimi had a bit of a stippled, mealy feeling on my tongue, as if it had been frozen, thawed, and frozen again. So, once again, I found the gestalt of previous reviewers of Nakama to be right on.

Nakama offers only two desserts currently: green tea ice cream and green tea cheesecake. We ordered one of each. They were OK but nothing special.

We would consider returning to Nakama but, as other patrons of this restaurant have suggested, we would stick to the first part of the menu and avoid the nigiri and sashimi second half of the restaurant’s offerings. For less expensive and good quality nigiri and sashimi in an unpretentious atmosphere, Zaoh, a sushi place that has been around forever, is only a block away at Mission & South Van Ness.<//Review>

<Text>Michael the store manager is absolutely the very best. He has given us the most terrific service over the years we would never dream of going anywhere else. Since we're older during this covid-19 virus even offered to go grocery shopping for us. How in the world can you ever beat a place like this.

I want to be able to give Mike a million stars. He is incredible. My husband and daughter were in a severe car accident in April. My daughter was wishe rushed to UC Davis where I immediately joined her. I wasn't able to leave nor would I have. I was getting such an influx of calls and texts that my phone couldn't handle it. I called Mike as my husband and I have been going to him for years. . I told him what was going in and I could feel the empathy on his voice. To hear a familiar voice in that situation was priceless. But to also know he truly cared meant more to me than words can say. He set up my new phone without me having to be there and allowed my mother in law to go purchase it
Thank you Mike ❤ you have no idea how amazing you are to my family and I!</Text>

Having visited this location 4 or 5 times, I am consistently impressed with the quality of service. They are ever courteous, ne er rushing me through, but explaining and instructing a long the way. Of all locations I have visited this is the best....i applaud the staff at MetroPCS, 7060 Sunrise Bkvd., Citrus Heights,  CA.  You are the BEST!<//Text>

< Review>
Mo is the man, excellent service and probably the most knowledgeable guy I've ever met, I went to a few stores in the citrus heights area and this store beat them all, don't even get me started with the corporate store across from the mall they are the worst. Mo got me the phone I needed and explained all the options as far as prices, this was the only store that didn't force me to buy a package deal with accessories. Thanks Mo and Scott you guys are the best.< /Review>

<text>I will never go to another Metro PCS store other than this one. This store is by far the most helpful straight forward non gouging or pushing an agenda for sales store. The owner is absolutely without a doubt one of Citrus Heights best retailers. He repaired my phone inexpensively and on the spot. Highly recommend this location.< /text><user>114556766325439107715<//user>< response>

Long story short, I was told one thing by an employee, but something completely different by a manager. The manager was very rude and refused to listen to what I had to say. He berated his own employee in front of me and acted like it was my problem. I will never go to this Metro store again.</review>

<Review>I get so hesitant to go the phones store because I always feel like I'm being taken advantage of by somebody who works on commission, not these guys, they were great Mike was super helpful and helped my mom transition into a smart phone which us kids couldn't do. Another thing I notice we went with the whole family kids and all and it wasn't a prolem a lot of time you take kids to these places and the sales people are always looking at u like your the worst, but it was not a problem, we got everything we needed and everybody left happy, will only shop here when it comes to MetroPCS even when there's one super close to my house I'll gladly go further to have Mike helpe again.< /Review></record>

Been dealing with Mike for a few years now. Very knowledgeable, doesent up-sell you or charge "extra" for phone issues that that can come with setting up new phones. Helps you understand the phone. Doesn't look at you as if everyone should know how to run everything. I wont deal with anyone else.</review>

I actually ended up at this MetroPCS store by accident but I'm glad I did. The young man who helped me with my purchase and activation was very helpful, polite and didn't try to add on extra services I didn't need or want. The other reason I give this store 5 stars is because after a few days of using the phone I was and satisfied and I called the store to ask if I could return the phone and exchange it for another. The gentleman I spoke with told me yes and that it wouldn't be a problem and he was right. The exchange was fast, no questions asked. If you want excellent customer service which is rare to find I recommend shopping here.</text>

<Text>I visited two metro stores, the one across the street from Sunrise Mall. Unfortunately I bought my phone from them. They didn't transfer half of my old phones data. Lost all my games and photos. They screwed up my Facebook too. Then I was so upset. I went to another store, located in the food max shopping center. This guy really knows his stuff. It took him 2 hours to fix the mess the other store made of my phone. He was able to retrieve all my lost photos and games. I highly recommend this dealer. When I get a new phone ,he is the only Metro store I will ever go to again.<//Text><Rating>1< /Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x809adfd16e139ef7:0x66eac7bc8593c622</Gmap_id><userid>107343320438539063743< /userid><username>Kathy Houlihan< /username></record></dataset><record>

Don't worry they exchanged all my info onto a different slower cheaper sd card.
But it was a 100+ dollar sd card.
Horrible horrible horrible horrible.
Tried to save myself money and LOST BIG.
He said the cameras wouldnt be able to see it or the quality wouldn't be good enough.
He showed me current footage....it looked good enough to see what happened when he asked me and my children to wait outside.
Yes they seemed nice but they stole from me and were very sloppy about it.
All of my pictures cant even fit on this 32 card but they fit just fine on my 128.
They tried to say on top of it i was lying about the kind of card i had.</Text><response>None< /response>< UserId.>

Solar hasn't been producing for months. Can't get any help. They don't answer phones. I've put in a claim online several times. Don't use this company.</review>

1st Light Energy replaced my faulty SolarEdge inverter with a new one. The crew knew what they were doing and finished quickly. Jessica Winslow is an amazing customer service manager. She kept me informed of the next steps and debugged the inverter issues with the SolarEdge. Also replies very quickly.</Review>

The best part is that I haven't paid more than $88.00 A month in over 18 months and this includes my lease payment.For the past 6 months my payment has just been the lease payment of $68.00.

If you can get past the deceiving office workers, the techs and salesmen (all have left because apparently they treat their employees like they do their clients) are spot on. Don’t fall for the rebate that the sale team promise you because the office will work it out EVEN THOUGH it’s built into what they charge you per kilowatt.

Do yourself a favor and go with a different company and read reviews!< /Text>

I was quite happy with the price and product. My only complaint is they should have recommended/installed pigeon screens around the perimeter, although I don’t think it’s that popular. But it should be, all houses with solar in our neighborhood now have pigeons living under them.</text>

This is our second solar system with 1st Light when we moved to our new home putting solar in was a top priority.  We would not want to work with anyone else.  1st Light delivers the quality product they promise< /review>

Only reason it's 4 stars is I lost 2 wks production while awaiting parts.
Once the parts arrived service crew made it all good.<//text>

<Review>Worst Customer Service Ever.  My experience with them was for a warranty service issue as they are a Fronius Certified Warranty Company.
1.  They never answer their phone: You will listen to a voicemail recording saying to leave a message and they will return it in 24-48 hours.  They never returned my calls.
2.  Finally connected on email and set up a service call and cleaning for June 25, 2018.  After taking the time off of work, they were a no show.  Finally got through to their Service Coordinator who told me they had a computer glitch.  Set up another service call for July 17th.  Showed up for this one, but wasn't aware they were supposed to clean my panels until I showed them the email confirming that service.  To his credit they did clean the panels, and evaluated the faulty inverter.  After cleaning my panels, the other inverter failed.  They contacted Fronius and they told him it wasn't his fault.  The service guy said he would take his inverter assessment back to the manager, and then call with an estimate for repairs, and warranty credit.  It's been SIX weeks, and with multiple phone calls and emails not returned, I give up.  These guys could take Customer Service classes from the local DMV office and it would be an improvement.  They may be attentive to you when they are selling a new install, but spend your money on a company that will back up their products.</Review>< GmapID>

<Review>I've had my system for several years now. I estimate that I save around $2,200 per year on my electric bill. My statements are consistent and I've had no issues.</Review>< time>

<review>I wouldn't trust this company. They promised work in March, screwed up the permits with the city, didn't have the foresight to fix  problems. We were left waiting until July.  They are late on absolutely everything. They still owe me money for referring another customer to them. When I sent a letter demanding that they pay, I received a phone call from a representative of the company who yelled and screamed at me in a very unprofessional manner.  I would never invest a second of my time, money or energy with this company.< /review><GmapID>0x8090410d57637a0d:0x7fa75e4f5e6add12</GmapID>< UserId.>

All of my personal belongings are being stored in the Devon storage off of Gene Autry Drive in Palm Springs, California. When I inquired about storage and prices, the manager could not have been more informative, personable, and willing to assist me. I have rented from this location several times in the past. My experience this time was so much more positive all because of the manager. She is truly an asset to Devon.</text>

I'm a new resident of the desert. We were in a hurry to locate a good, reliable storage facility. An on-line service, selfstorage.com introduced me to Devon. The storage service quoted terrific prices they sounded great and they were close by. I showed up the next morning and everything that was promised, including the exceptional rates were confirmed. No surprises. I like that. Makes me want to store more items with Devon.< /text>

Clorissa was pleasant and helpful,  so setting up went very well.
The 5 stars are only for Clorissa.
Devon Storage has some technically erroneous,(read illegal) , and exsorbanate punitive policies that make me almost curious enough to test in a courtroom.  Facilities are clean and seem safe. Although, they no longer provide any refuse bins.< /Text>

< review>
What a terrible terrible attitude I walked in to the office with. Everything going wrong type of day. Clarissa greeted me with a smile and a welcome. Within a couple minutes my attitude had dissolved and we were bantering like old friends. I thought I was distracting her with my woes, next thing I know we're on our way to my new unit and a signature or 2 later I was off and on my way.... Sometimes the greatest gifts come from strangers in the form of a smile and great service. Thank you Clarissa and Devon Storage.... I appreciate you.<//review>

<Text>I don’t typically take the time to fill out reviews; however, my experience with Devon Storage on Gene Autry Trail and specifically Heather Meyer was outstanding. I needed a last minute solution to store furniture and after calling a couple other companies, Heather was the friendly can-do associate to get my storage unit arranged and at a reasonable price. She went out of her way to find the unit to meet my needs and in a convenient area for loading and unloading. The location is clean, ideal and safe. There are cameras monitoring the area and there is a manager who lives on site. Thanks Heather and Devon Storage!</Text><rate>5</rate><username>Pierre Vejar<//username>< gmapID>

The location is awesome, the hours and accessibility are great!  (Until 10:00 pm :), the management by Clarissa and all of her staff is so professional, so caring and so fair!
Can’t say enough about how grateful I am to have finally found a storage place that feels like home!< /review>< rate>

When I went in, manager Clarissa  appeared to be training a new employee. In the few minutes I was there Clarissa managed to belittle and berate this new employee to the point I didn’t feel comfortable being there! Totally and completely unprofessional! This company needs to find new management for this facility.

<Review>Let's face it, no one likes money year after year to store stuff but sometimes it is simply inevitable.  With that said, this storage facility location (where I have been for more than 15 years) is simply the best now that is owned and/or operated by Devon.

Krystal is the best manager ever at this location and makes it much easier to deal with the depressing nature of having and paying for a storage unit.

In order to cut down on my monthly storage costs, I decided to finally move into a smaller-size unit and Krystal did a marvelous job in making the transition as smooth as possible.

This facility is clean, secure, has great access hours for customers, and I feel safe keeping my stuff at this location.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

The staff at Devon Self Storage have been wonderful to work with.  Very helpful and friendly.  We will likely use them again and would recommend for others looking for a storage unit to try them out.<//Text>

The prices for units are incredibly fair, and much cheaper than their nearby competitors. The units appear to be well taken care of for a storage facility and security to access the property is restricted time wise and one entrance to enter and exit. Units are not temperature controlled and the possibility of flooding (due to flash floods) has never occurred and appears to be well built to prevent such occrances.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Crystal was very professional and easy to work with.  She quickly showed me a storage unit and had me on my way. The storage unit was clean and in good order. The cost was lower than other facilities in the same neighborhood. I highly recommend this location and Crystal if you are looking for storage.</review>

<text>Convenient location for furniture storage.  The unit I rented had not been cleaned so caused some stress and anxiety on move day.  I recommend the unit floors be swept and mopped between occupants and delivered clean.  The number pads to gain gate access are worn out.  Can't read numbers or symbols easily so difficult to find the correct keys.  Clarissa was helpful which I appreciated.  My rating would have been higher had the unit been clean.  To expect people to put their furniture on a filthy floor is a huge "negative".</text></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend using this Devons in S. Palm Springs because of the manager, Clorissa. The level of customer service is above all others. Clorissa is very helpful, understanding and able to provide different options for every move. The location is clean, convenient and safe. They have trucks to rent and even a cart you may borrow. I highly recommend this Devons next to the water park. Thank you!!!<//text>

<text>Your search is over!  I looked around this area for self storage and was floored at the prices.  Small spaces at $80+/month.  Then I searched online and found this CubeSmart.  Not only did I get twice the space for $30 less, it was discounted 15% for reserving online and first month free. Month to month, no contract!  Signup was simple and fast.  Best, I was allowed to use their truck for just the price of the gas!  Krystal Mendez assisted me and she was very professional and answered my questions politely and without rush.  This whole experience was so smooth and Krystal is the best!<//text>< GmapID>

The location has always been a draw for me.  I see how clean the facility is, how home like it is in its own way.  I only use Devon when in need of storage;  the need seems to come about every 4 yrs. Give or take a year.  I would gladly suggest Devon to anyone who has need of storage.  The location, the clearness, the convenience is the big draw for me.  By the way, to all I never give anyone or anything a perfect rating.  Show what\who is perfect and I'll show you who we all want to be.< /review><user>118167647734848525895</user><username>MegaMichael1952</username>< rate>

<review>I have many storage units all over Southern California for work purposes.. by far Devon at this Palm Springs location is the best, and I always enjoy being greeted with a smile and a clean facility.  The gate hours are fantastic open until 9:45pm for late night people like myself.  I have been there for years.. and that just goes to show you Good Customer Service will always keep you coming back...< /review>< Rating>

<review>The staff is pretty helpful.  A few things were a chagelled.  The doors were difficult going down.  They got stuck coming down.  We had to force to be able to get them down.   The doors are heavy and old.  The need to repair them. They need to hire a general contactor  or a handyman to fix those doors, since they are very old doors.

Also, they need to have an area where you can throw away the trash.  A community dumpster area too.

They need more room to be able to park your car too.

Finally, the need to stop increasing the rent every few months,   They need to increase it once a year.< /review>< gmap_id>

Horrible Albert lies when he says he price matched. Don't be fooled with there high prices Lieberman storage is way cheaper.< /Text>

< Review>
Property stolen by staff, district manager suggested I piggy back on a recent legitimate police report/theft of another tenant and commit insurance fraud to cover the loss of my belongings.  Then threatened to call the police on me when I disagreed with his suggestions. Received an eviction notice the following day.</Review>

<rating>3</rating><review>When I signed up for the storage unit, I was told that it would be swept out and when I got there to put my stuff in the unit it was not.  I was just shown where the broom was and that was it.   I thought the least that could be done is that the space would be swept.<//review>< UserId.>

<Text>the staff is very inefficient I bought a part that should arrive the next day and when looking for it they told me that the order was not requested by the cashier and that now I should wait two days I asked him if he could send it to me and the manager named Evan only told me  No, and if I wanted to, I would go to find her, if not, she would give me back the money and there are no more solutions.  inefficient.< /Text>< pics>

They always stare at me like I'm doing something wrong, often try to rush mr out of the store.
It's very uncomfortable and inappropriate behavior that a business should have toward it's paying customers.<//text>

Lived there for ~9 months, early terminated to move back to south bay.

Good:
- Good price in this area
- 90% Quiet & good structure to block outside noise
- Staff is good.
- Good gym with squat machine - better than south bay ones.

Bad:
-2 inner-noise. The exhausting pipe is connected to neighbor's living room. They had a crying baby at 6am. And suddenly it became my problem and disrupted my sleep. They should either offer discount or allow people to know what family composition is in their neighbor. Imaging flying a overnight plane every night with a crying baby onboard.
- $300 parking fee - well, it is SF. can't blame anyone
- Still pricy, but it is SF< /review>

<text>My experience here living with @fvcproductions in another review has been great! I've been here for 1.5 years about. The rent is moderately high but totally reasonable in that you have all the amenities you need in-unit and a nice modern look.

The place has a gym, a rooftop shared area, a hot-tub (that's honestly usually empty), an outdoor grill, stove/washer/dryer/dishwasher in unit, etc etc. Convenient friendly and clean!< /text>< pictures>

A Lovely Place to Live, With Super Service and Personnel

Rincon Green Apartments is a great place to call home. The community is extremely beautiful, well-kept and peaceful. In fact, everything is so beautiful that I felt like I lived at a resort. The staff always greet residents with a smile, are very attentive to their needs and are quick to attend to any problems that arise. I would like to give special kudos to maintenance worker Andrew and property managers Laila and Janae. Once, I spilled laundry detergent on my apartment's carpet, and I was in a panic because I really don't like the sticky, messy feeling of the laundry detergent residue. I submitted the service request in the morning and Andrew helped me do a deep cleaning of the entire apartment's carpet the same day! What an awesome service! Laila and Janae from the leasing office are super helpful and accommodating. They always try their best to make residents' stay in the community as comfortable as possible. My initial apartment was faced the street, and I couldn't get used to the noise. After learning about the issue, Laila and Janae immediately transferred me to a quiet courtyard apartment at a discounted price. My sleeping quality has since improved significantly!

The apartment could not be in a better location and is close to many shops, grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, bars and transportation options. It offers some of the most cutting-edge designs and boutique amenities in the area. Amenities include a community park, rooftop lounge with a hot tub and grill (I have thrown two BBQ parties here, and my guests had a great time and were extremely satisfied), a 24-hour fitness center, concierge and cyber café, on-site Zipcar and panoramic city views. The apartment is within walking distance of the downtown financial district, SOMA, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Visa, MasterCard, and all the major tech companies. It is also just a10-minute walk to Embarcadero Boulevard, where you can enjoy breathtaking views of the bay and the Bay Bridge!

In summary, I really enjoyed my time here, as the apartment was very clean, comfortable and had everything I could need! In addition, the maintenance worker is super-efficient, and the office staff are friendly. I will always recommend this fabulous apartment to others!</text>

<Time>1548344398143<//Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>The staff of an apartment building makes all the difference, Rincon Green has very helpful and friendly folks taking care of everything. Also, they are excellent at handling deliveries and packages.

2 years later... Still great!

Rent increases have been reasonable. Two years in a row they offered NO increase IF you renewed early, though sadly not doing that at the moment (Jan 2019)

Did I mention every unit has built in, stacked clothes washer and dryer that they maintain!?  No more shared laundry room nonsense, this was a HUGE point for me personally; your priorities may vary.  And these are small-ish, somewhat compact machines, so you can’t do “gianormous loads”, but a reasonable amount is fine. Dishwasher is also a bit more narrow than full sized ones, at least in my studio apartment, but it works, just smaller loads.

The next 3 topics may sound like negatives, but it’s an attempt to keep a well running building, so I’m not making judgement calls here, just offering “full disclosure”

Temp parking pass is needed even for an hour, and it’s $40, even if you only use 1 hour. I’m guessing they keep it high so SF visitors don’t use it for a generic parking garage, so it’s a bit above regular parking garages, but maybe by only $10 or something - parking in SF SoMa/Financial district is expensive, especially if there’s a game or some other big event.

EV charging: There are a few EV charging station in basement level 2, I forget the service.  3 slots, but there’s usually a vacant slot. I think you still need to pay the $40 if you’re a guest, plus the RV service charge.

AirBNB-able?  ABSOLUTELY NOT. SF may allow it in some buildings, but not here. And it can be a first-offense eviction, and the staff knows the tenants pretty well, and there’s security RFID on the elevators, and I think they maybe even do spot checks for ads, so don’t do it, you’ll likely be caught and possibly evicted.

Also, zero smoking or vaping, can also be an eviction. And no, going out on the balcony or trying to blow smoke into a vent won’t work - it’s a very “green” building so smoke doesn’t dissipate and they will hunt people down if they get complaints.

But again, this is just info to consider, for many of us residents it works out great!<//Review>< Pics>

<review>We love living here so much that we have recently renewed our lease. Although it is not cheap to live here, we appreciate all the valuable services that this building provides, at a very reasonable rate. You could surely get cheaper, but you will have to deal with shady landlords.

Rincon Green is run by Emerald Fund, who have the most fantastic staff: Laila and Vanessa manage the building, while Sarah and Emyli are the friendliest leasing agents around. Make sure you tell them about my review. They organize monthly get-togethers to introduce you to your neighbours. Joey and Cameron watch over the concierge desk during the day, making sure to sign for our deliveries and greeting guests. At nights, there is very friendly security and the park gates are locked. Jerry and Jairell are maintenance and they make sure everything is in tip-top shape. It's a new building, built in 2012, but when we had trouble with the heat and plumbing, they showed up right away!

The building is really lovely, there's Emerald Park as our front yard, with a playground for the little ones to climb on. Inside the building, there's a courtyard with a rock garden and water fountain. If you get a unit with a balcony, it's easy to forget you are actually living in a big city. There is free Philz coffee in the morning, with complimentary tea throughout the day. We really enjoy using the rooftop hot tub after working out in the nice gym on the first floor. And there's also a couple of communal gas grills for quick no-mess dinners.

As for the units, they are a little small, but with good furniture a couple can live comfortably in a 1-bedroom apartment. You can find the floor plans on their website. Each unit comes with apartment-sized appliances: washer, dryer, stove and oven, microwave, and fridge. Since this is an eco-friendly building, there solar-powered heat but no air-conditioning. Since SF doesn't get that hot or cold, we keep the windows open most of the time. If you need a parking space, that's extra, but they do have ports for cars to charge.

We don't really need one, because there are three Zipcars available in the parking garage. And we ride our bikes, which are safely locked up in the storage rooms. You also get Webpass for Internet, which is speedy and reliable. They have Laundry Lockers downstairs if you want someone else to handle your clothes. You can also rent a storage locker, but I think they have a deal with Omni for on-demand storage. And they have a deal with Zeel for discounted massages.

There are a couple of disadvantages though: the sidewalks in the area are often unusable due to the condos popping up all over Rincon Hill. There is also the new Transbay Terminal that is being built, so it does get noisy on the weekends. And since it's close to the Bay Bridge, with its on- and off-ramps, traffic does back up on Harrison St.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Wonderful community with great amenities.  I enjoy the convenience of a 24 hour gym and large swimming pool.  The office staff is super helpful and friendly.  I loved that they had live music by the pool and the staff handing out icy otter pops on a hot day.< /Review>

Used to be good to live in Summer House, maybe 2 years ago!  But now?! No way, they just don’t care about the tenants, they don’t clean anymore! Do you have more than one car? You should sell it before live here, they don’t offer more than one parking spot, not even if you’re willing to pay for it. Parking on the street? Forget it, you won’t find spots available after 6pm!</text>

One of the worst places and worst leasing team I’ve ever seen in my life. They were nasty from the moment I walked in to the moment I told them their disgusting apartments aren’t worthy of a cockroach. René was particularly horrible, steer clear at all costs.<//Text>

The good:
Average $2400 for 2 bedroom during the pandemic

The bad:
Entire building is made out of inferior material meaning different apartment residents will get annoyed if your dogs and children start making noise and playing.
No parking at all. One permit is issued and since summer house is overly crowded and in an area with other apartments, you will have to park 6/7 blocks away :(
Many unregistered dogs in the apartment. So, in case dogs get involved in incidents like fights or bite, the apartment management will do nothing at all to find the owners of the dog.
Can't reach the admin staff at the numbers listed on google and reviews. Goes to voice mailbox which will be 100% full all of the time.
Mountains of trash and furniture piled up from Sunday evening to Monday mornings.
It's smoke free apt. You can smoke freely as you wish.

Finally, trying to get my deposit back.<//text>

The worst administration that this venue can have, I have been waiting for 7 months for the deposit that I gave to be returned and to date they do not give me a reason. I call and call asking for the return of the deposit and they have a piece of their files and information, now it turns out that I owe a rent for December when my lease ended in October and I left the apartment in that month. I do not recommend this place to live.<//review>

< Review>
The renovated apartments are nice (not all are renovated, though) and Alameda is just lovely, but the property management company for this apartment complex is the worst I've dealt with in 10+ years of renting.

They weren't even friendly when we signed a lease over two years ago, but that's fine. One particular guy used to go out of his way to harass kids at the pool for doing nothing. But things got much worse with COVID, as they barricaded themselves in their office and refused to answer the phones or emails. The package locker room situation turned into complete mayhem and packages were going missing, but they insisted this was because "residents weren't picking up their package" rather than acknowledging they didn't have nearly enough lockers for a place so big (the same thing would happen during the holidays). I am very sympathetic to the fact that they needed to close the office and all amenities to keep everyone safe and of course agree with that decision, but they never so much as acknowledged that we had 1.5 years of not being able to access the pool and gym, and they made themselves completely unavailable the entire duration of the pandemic.

The worst was when we tried to move out. It took weeks to get them to acknowledge our move-out notice, with repeated calls and emails left unanswered. We had to resort to sliding the letter under the leasing office door several times before we were acknowledged. Now we've moved across the country and we have yet to hear about our security deposit, which is a lot of money, and of course they aren't answering our repeated calls or emails.<//Review>

The only person to answer my calls has been Deveaon, but that's not a bad thing! She was there to help every time I had a question or needed some assistance. She took the pain and struggle away from finding a new place to live. I love the geography and location of the apartments! It puts a smile on my face knowing that any worries that I might have immediately gets dissolved by the comfort of the front desk! If I lived a thousand lifetimes, I would choose to live at the summer houses every single day because of their helpful staff!<//review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Absolutely horrible experience with this place. It’s been over 8 months since we moved out and we still haven’t received our deposit or heard back from anyone. We called a number of times and they’ve just kept saying the check will be mailed to us in a couple of days. We still haven’t heard from them or received anything in the mail, but seeing some other reviews this seems to be a pretty standard way they scam people. Not to mention the place is a nightmare, always loud, dirty in all common areas, and everyone is allowed to smoke although the complex is “non-smoking”. Avoid this place at all costs, and Summer House we’ll see you in small claims court very soon.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My car was towed unlawfully in violation of vehicle code section 22658. The notices that they said were posted were torn and shoddy and were not marked on all parking spots to which it applied. Our car was also towed outside of the stated time window. I had to pay $290 to get the car out even after serving a demand letter on the towing company for return of my car.

We weren’t the only victims of this. When we went to recover our car there were at least 6 other Summer House residents in line waiting to get their cars as well. Same story: cars towed without proper notice.

I was going let to be bygones be bygones. We just moved here and we’re still getting used to their brand of disrespect. But when my partner went to let them know about the issue they were rude as all hell and dismissive. If we don’t get refunded the towing fees we may have to chat about it on the record, in front of the Superior Court.

I knew I was onto something when I waived the arbitration clause in our lease agreement.

Welcome to Pop Copy.

Oops.

I have been living here for the past 2,5 years.
Unfortunately my experience is that they don't care about the residents living here, although when you come here first as a potential resident to rent an apartment, they will be very welcoming just to get you sign with them.
The only positive people working here are the maintenance team that is trying hard to solve any maintenance problems. But the people working at the leasing office are unresponsive, inattentive and will not respond to emails or phone calls for days or even at all!
I waited days to get response from Tim about my case, and then when I didn't get any response to my emails or phone calls, I had reach out to Andrea, but again she was neither helpful, neither considerate, and did not show care to resolve my issue.
What a disappointment it has been to receive no help from the leasing office when I needed one. And this has happened to me not only once but a couple of times already.
A note of suggestion for the management:
Care for the current residents the way you show care to the new potential residents touring the apartments. Make everyone inclusive and be fair, treat all people nice, after all kindness goes a long way!
This is what is lacking from this community.
And maybe this is why you are seeing so many people moving out of here because you don't respect your current residents.<//Review>

My little family has settled into our lovely new apartment here at Summer House. We want to give thanks to the staff that helped us, in what turned out to be a months long move in process due to the pandemic, and living hundreds of miles away. We appreciate Andrea, Devan, Tim, and the others that were patient with us along the way. They are always friendly, answered our calls or responded to emails in a timely manner, and have been tremendously helpful.

The apartment move in date was delayed because of renovations, but it was worth the wait. The community is very friendly, with a few drawbacks of having some overly noisy neighbors at night, but that's an issue anywhere. We haven't been here too long, but are enjoying it thus far. We are happy to call this home!< /review>

I really enjoy living here. The staff and maintenance are always helpful with smiles on their face. Yesterday I called in with a maintenance issue and Kwesi quickly came to my rescue with a smile. If it wasn't for him, it would have been a long miserable day! My only complaint of these apartments is the parking. I am not going anywhere anytime soon!

Move during this pandemic has not been so easy, moving in to the Summer House was yet one more big task after years you think you finaly have got it down, somethingthing turns up in our lives. I want to give a huge thanks and shout out! To Cindy that helped me, in what most difficult time to move to a new home due to the pandemic, and living hundreds of miles away.We appreciate all the help from Cindy and for all the patience she has had with us along the way.<//review>

<Review>The worst place I ever had they only care about the rent fee$$$ , I lived her for years paying $2500 and I forgot to put my parking tag and guess what got towed and payed $300
Parked at 7pm towed 2am reason not hung in the the permit.  No warning no notice even though my car is registered in the lease I called the office and they said that is the rule. You don't have any credentials with them.  DUMB RULE<//Review>< pics>

My husband and I are currently looking for a 2 bedroom apartment bc our current landlord is selling his house. Luckily, we found Summer House.   Summer House location is awesome - it's far enough from the City but also has the residential feel to it.   We spoke with Tim Martinez and he totally eased our minds regarding moving during Covid times.  I can't thank him enough for his kindness.<//Review>

<GmapID>0x808f80df1c7d8be3:0x9029d8150390492< /GmapID><Text>If you’re somebody that likes to have everything well planned and a steady organized move in date then I don’t recommend Summerhouse, the leasing office really lack communication. They never answer a phone call, current tenents that live there and 1 lady that was moving out and where by the office have told me are you sure you want to move in here? (RED FLAG) but I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt so I continued the Move in process with these people, and up until this last incident.  I’ve called them many times to try to figure out why my move in date was unknowingly pushed to a later date, I asked for the day off from work 2 weeks in advance And even scheduled a uhaul reservation, Only to receive the move in contract via email which stated move in date on the 27th without notifying me, The move in date I requested was today the 26th of March, the price changes throughout the month but on their site you can see what the monthly rates changes to if you choose a specific date and it said $2045 to move in on the 26th, the contract also stated and increased to $2,160/month.... (RED FLAG) so my fiancé went to the office yesterday and they told her that the reason the date was pushed Last minute was because there was a hole in the tub, and I was put on speaker phone and asked why didn’t they communicate that with me and the woman’s excuse was because “they just found out yesterday” but not true at all cuz I noticed the change of date like 3 days before and I was calling like 15 times a day and no answer (RED FLAG)if my fiancé had never went to the office we wouldn’t hear from them at all the lady’s excuse was because they are really busy dealing with 600 units..(RED FLAG)these people lack customer service i literally backed out of that place immediately, I know that it was only 1 day of difference but you have to communicate, because I organized a whole plan for this date. this place needs more and even possibly new employees who take the job seriously. The area is pretty nice good looking buildings, almost makes you want to ignore the terrible customer service that the leasing office has to offer. I only shared what really cut it for me which is only about 50% of my experience and the lady did not seem to care when I backed out (HUGE RED FLAG) considering there’s  a lot of vacant rooms on their site. good luck to anyone applying here!

Mislead with apartment amenities and lack of customer service with leasing staff. There’s no assigned parking and you’ll have a really hard time looking for parking. Dog feces are all over the property and sidewalks alongside the property. Roaches inside the apartment as well and they do nothing about these problems. I’ve only been here 1 month and my wall panel is falling off. Things were not properly done before I moved in. The only upside is the area is really quiet.< /Text>

While having to deal with so many disappointing situations in the past I'm very compelled to leave a good great review for the positive experience I had when I had to call for a minor repair at the worst time during quarantine.  Flooding toilets is never a good thing and I was pleased with the timely manner and cleanliness of the maintenance technician Kwesi.....very polite and well mannered as well.</text>

Great location for this property but customer service here sucks.  Service requests takes longer to get done.
Existing residents needs  and concerns are overlooked  And not addressed and always looking for ways to increase rent year after year with same existing amenities.

Calls are not returned and if the staff schedules a call appointment with you, they do not follow through and when you call, they tell you they were busy and forgot about it.

A few break ins have happened in the last couple years and complex is not doing anything to beef up security.

If you want a place with great customer service, follow through, customer retention programs, then THIS IS NOT YOUR PLACE.</Review>

I certainly wish I had the vocabulary to aptly describe what a pleasure it was to meet with Devann and discuss my potential living arrangements at Summer House. With the stresses of a career and family move being what they are, Devann greeted my family and I with a warm smile and a professional attitude. We left confident and well satisfied with the options available to us and truly hope to work with her again in the future! Thank you so very much, Devann, for making us feel at home!< /review>

Nice place to live, large patios and balconies.  Marco the maintenance guy knows what he's doing. Rony who has been here a while has always been responsive and helpful  also, as well as the front office staff, especially Devann.   Great work</Review>

<review>STAY AWAY. I’d give 0 stars if I could. The laundry machines constantly break down mid-cycle. We got one of the remodeled units which looked great, but turned out to be extremely poorly done. Cabinets fall off, permanent floorboard glue tracked all throughout the unit, the list goes on and on and on. And good luck getting anyone to fix stuff- it took 7 months of complaining for them to replace our screen door which was broken before we moved in. Worst of all, we keep getting turned down for other apartments we apply to because they can’t get a hold of the Summer House leasing office. Call the office phone, bang on the door, it won’t matter. No one is going to help you. Again, STAY AWAY.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

My company is one of the vendors for Summer House and Alliance Residential. We have done quite a bit of work there and I have worked with the Regional Manager, Christina Gregory quite a bit. She has always been extremely helpful and friendly in our interactions and communications. This property has always been very well  maintained and Christina seems to have this site completely dialed in. Working with her and the staff there has always been a pleasure and I hope to continue our working relationship with Christina and her staff at this property.<//text>

Affordable and the units are newly renovated. Kitchens definitely got a full makeover.

High speed internet is not available in this complex yet.

The leasing office made a turn around with new management and has made their office more available for tenants and applicants.

This place could really use some security or at least cameras.<//review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>EDIT: This review will stay at 1 star until Summer House returns my calls regarding refunding a portion of my final month's rent, refunding my security deposit, and retrieving the modem left in my apartment.

The apartments are decent upon first look, but the cracks start to show. I haven't experienced any parking issues since I've used public transit and my motorcycle to get around.

Pros:
Modern kitchen
Good appliances
Well kept grounds
Fair pricing
Mostly quiet
Luxer lockers (like Amazon) for packages
Nice pool
Motorcycle parking

Cons:
Bedrooms have no built-in lighting
Problematic bathroom drains
Textured paint w/ some overpaint
Dirty hallways
Seeing at least a cockroach a day
Balcony screen door does not fit or slide properly
Caulking peeling and revealing older, rotten in places caulking.

The staff has done really great through these crazy COVID-19 times and I appreciate all their efforts. The landscapers and housekeeping staff are always extremely kind when you bump into them. The windows in the living room are large and amazing! The updates are beautiful! And I absolutely love how I could use my credit card for laundry and not have to worry about carrying around quarters!! Also, I see a lot of parking issue comments - I have yet to experience those issues for myself. Keep up the great work SummerHouse! I’m looking forward to my continued residency at the community!< /Text>< Pictures>

Weed and cigarettes smokers even in laundry room and stairways, dirty hallways and elevators, vandalism graffiti on walls and doors, broken panels on stairways, bad sound insulation between floors and walls, and more!!! You pay the rent and still have to report about all of that to be fixed and cleaned. Poor management service ( Pinnacle Management in the past, now under a new management team by Allresco)

Update:
I was trying to reach you and speak with general manager or supervisors - it’s been a month, no response, you don’t return calls. Spoke with management and they were so “nice” promised to give me a call back. Left couple emails describing my issues - no one responded.

I would not choose to live here as long as Summer House is in contract with PPI, a predatory towing company. They look for an excuse to tow anyone, and do not care if they are a resident or not.

< review>
I can confidently and strongly say that there is an immense negligence with respect to elevators. Different buildings have elevator problems. Specifically speaking, 457 has a long standing elevator problem. The management told about 4-6 weeks of repairing time. Let me say, it is not working since May. Carrying heavily loads from shopping, I am afraid I will have a back problem. Also, washing machines broke down. The management says “it can take a little bit longer, use other buildings’ machines” complacently. In the case big troubles like this, the management is “comfortable” and senseless towards residents’ suffering. If we think financially and fairly, we have to charge and refund some money due to lack of contract promises. No elevator...Yet, if you pay the rent a day late, you are in trouble. You will be fined daily. It should be enjoyable in managerial perspective. The buildings are generally dirty. Last one, a big tray of food left over started in front of the stairs at least three days. I mean, I cannot neglect the positive things as well, yet these are due resident communities kindness and behaviors. When we first entered the apartment, there was a non-working fridge. When we left our shoes in front of the apartment, we get “warning” but when the elevator does not work, no problem for months. Let the poor resident suffer.<//review>

<review>This place is not a good place to rent. Management is terrible; they don't know how to communicate with their residents; they never follow up with your issues. For the price we were paying, we had our light turn off several times  because there were issues with their electrical systems. The after hour maintenance service didn't work because they are never there; if you have a problem with maintenance you have to wait the next morning to get it fixed since nobody is there after 6pm. After we moved out, they charged us for carpet cleaning, painting and cleaning even though we clean the place. Before we moved in, they promised us a $500 visa gift card that we never got.
I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I moved in to an apartment at summer house 2 weeks ago and so far I absolutely love it! The apartments are very nice and spacious, and the amenities are awesome! Deeba helped us through the application process and she was fabulous. She made our move in run very smoothly and was easy to reach whenever we had questions or needed help with something. I would definitely recommend summer house to anybody looking to move to Alameda.</Text>< UserId.>

I moved in to apartment last week ago and i loved the apartment. Amazing facilities. Talking about staff especially deeba she was very welcoming and kind, she even helped me carry the luggage all through to my apartment  and also helped me finding nearby stores for household shopping. I am absolutely in love with summer house apartments.</text>

<Review>Do you enjoy getting woken up at 5am every morning by various car alarms?  Do you enjoy getting woken up at 1am by loud, obnoxious neighbors, their kids, or their dogs yelling and screaming?  Do you enjoy coming home late from work to find parking unavailable due to non residents taking up extra spots, along with double parking everywhere?  Do you enjoy broken glass all over the parking lots where you have to walk every day?  Do you enjoy getting mean mugged by people brown bagging and chain smoking in the parking lot right next to your car (like come on, don’t you have a better place to do that?).  If you can check all these boxes, then I guess summer house apartments is the place for you!</Review>< date>

We were ready to sign a lease with Summer House but something just didn't feel right; the lack of clarity on the refund of a $200 holding deposit, the lack of email responses from management, and trouble communicating with them, the horrible reviews about these same issues on YELP and Google, and all the added fees ($100/month for a second parking space for example). We also searched the crime report through Trulia, and found there were a high number of reported auto thefts in January 2018. Not what I wanted to see when I'd be paying $100 extra a month for a parking spot that would be in an overflow lot.

We felt like the woman who was handling our application was not on the ball, very inexperienced and not able to give us straight answers. We asked for a full refund on our deposit, including background check since we requested this within 24hrs of putting down the deposit. After much back and fourth by the management, we were finally able to get our money back. When I went to the office to pick up our check, they had a sign on the leasing office that they were closed for a mtg, with the times of closure inaccurate. There were several tenants waiting outside, who told me that "this is how they always are." I am just glad we got our money back and will not be living there.

Please also be aware, the company only accepts Cashiers checks when applying and putting down any initial deposit. My banker found this strange, as a money order and cashiers check is the same from your bank. Only a cashiers check cost $10 to issue as opposed to $5 for a money order. I was told by the same woman doing our application that this is because a money order isn't traceable and a cashier's check is. Wells Fargo seems to think it's because they don't know what they're doing.</Text>

<name>Kathryn Winters</name><time>1551058843297</time><Rate>1</Rate><review>I’ve lived here for almost a year, and will not be renewing my lease. Some of the reasons are as follows: constant smell of cigarette and marijuana smoke in the building hallways, that has also frequently seeped into my apartment. I’ve tried working with the management on this issue since I moved in, but nothing has changed. There are numerous distributive residents who make the quiet enjoyment of my apartment impossible. Parking is a huge concern here. If you come home late there is little or no parking, and the parking spots are so narrow that, after 10 months here, my car has numerous door ding dents and has even been intentionally keyed in the parking lot. I’ve had a water leak that has taken over three months to get rapiers, still not fixed. Locks on the exterior building doors and the doors themselves rarely work properly, which means the building is far from secure. On that same topic, the vehicle entrance gate has pretty much been broken the entire time I have lived here. This means anyone can just wander on the property, so it’s just a constant stream of non residents parking in the lot along with non residents coming on the property to engage in what appears to be criminal activity. They recently changed security companies, and since that change I haven’t seen a single security guard. Seems they went from ineffective security to none at all. Cars frequently speed and screech tires in the parking lots, making them unsafe for pedestrians. The last straw was coming home to find a vehicle had plowed through another security gate and was abandoned on the common area grass. I don’t feel safe in this complex and will be moving out when my lease is up. When I bring up concerns to management I just get a whole lot of corporate speak, so things get done slowly, if at all. They try and cut costs at every corner, obviously hiring the lowest bidders to do repairs. The recently had some sidewalks replaced, and their contractor didn’t even use rebar in the concrete forms, so they will buckle and crack again, but cheap is cheap. So if you’re looking for overpriced unsafe housing and the constant nuisance of smoke and noise, then this is the place for you. As for me, I’ll be moving away and not coming back.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I really don’t understand what kind of management is in this appartment . Spacally about the parking it is very easy to register a plat number of residents car so if something happen they can call and notify to the resident instead of towing the car and charges $365 .that is not fair . And insects🕷 are everywhere ..< /review>

< Review>
Despite all the reviews, I decided to take a look at Summer House after unsuccessful attempts in finding affordable rentals in surrounding neighborhoods. I had lived in Alameda before AND took a look at Summer House 3 years prior. Now, I'm a resident here. I have to say that the new management has changed this place for the better. Now that construction is complete, the grounds are gorgeous with water fountains all around, a gigantic swimming pool and beautiful plants and flowers.  The groundskeepers should be given full credit, as I see them outside everyday working on keeping the place clean and attractive (*reviews have been given about the trash and furniture around the dumpsters, which is accurate still, however, this is at the fault of the residents, not the property managers). The ordinary apartments are comparable to their going rates, so if you are looking for something plain to get you through the year, this is a great spot. They come with a double sink, dishwasher, electric stove, microwave, carpeted rooms, and easy cable hookup. So far we've had to call maintenance twice in the 3 months that we've been here. Though some appliances were not working properly when we moved in, the maintenance people were there on time and fixed our problems right away... no questions asked. Be careful for the "water fee" which is divided among the complex as a whole and attached to your monthly rent. There is ample parking but the car gates are not secure. Plenty of kids here who play in the complex when school is out. We live with a 10 year-old so he made friends right away. Last note, it can get a little noisy since the walls are pretty thin. I would suggest sticking with a top floor.</Review>

I’ve been living at Summerhouse apartments for 4 years, place isn’t perfect but it has consistently improved. That said, the new property manager is incompetent beyond belief! This place has a lot of potential if they would get rid of him. Point in case:

The complex has been having problems with fake parking passes and non residents parking in the lots. New property managers solution? Set 5hrs of time for everyone to come in with their registration to reapply. Then he was “sick” the day after St. Patrick’s day so they had to rescheduled because apparently no one else is qualified to do this task. On the Saturday they rescheduled to it was a circus with no organization. He insists to meet with everyone one on one and do everything by himself, despite people waiting HOURS to reapply for something they are already paying for.

On top of that, when pepole complained about having to waste their Saturday he tried to guilt trip everyone saying he was “sacrificing his Saturday with his kids to help us” as if this wasn’t his job.

Bottom line, this place has a lot of potential, but I have major doubts with this guy at the lead.</Text>

<review>The apartments are not the issue with this place. The management is the issue. They are terrible. They never answer the phone. They say they don't get our rent checks, after we have physically dropped them off to them, then they decide to apply late fees for rent that is not even late. Literally every month it is an issue with them and paying my rent. They take a week to even process rent checks. They come with these random fees when we pay everything on time. If you get notices on your door, investigate before you just give them more money they claim you owe. Again, apartments are not an issue, its the management and staff. Way too unorganized for me.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Summer house apartments are a great option if you're moving into the bay. When I moved into Alameda 2 years ago I found their prices to be competitive and even though they raised my rent it's still below market value. They're dog friendly, pretty responsive, and the units themselves are on the nicer side. Everyone in my building is pretty chill and I haven't heard about any noise problems.
Cons:
- Not everyone is good with their own dog and I've seen several incidents where on-leash dogs were being really aggressive with other dogs (not the apartment's fault but it's still something to be aware of).
- We've had a few minor annoyances with maintenance but we don't call them very often.
- Sometimes non-residents will get into the habit of letting themselves into the complex. Nothing dangerous though. Example: For a few weeks a guy would use a stick every day to let himself into one of the parking lot areas and just make calls all day in front of my building. I guess it wouldn't have been an issue if he wasn't glaring at all of the residents that walked by.<//Text>

Previous to the new management I would have recommended Summer House. Now, I wouldn't even if it were half the price. You'll never see the same face twice in the management office since turnover is outrageous. Unfortunately, that means you won't see the person that promised to fix management's mistake and you'll have to go through the whole process again. For any little thing you'll have to visit at least 3 times before it gets corrected. They lose submitted paperwork like no one I've ever seen. The managers hide from the constant influx of dissatisfied tenants.</Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>This place is not worth it! There is very poor follow up from the current management with issues that need attention. Poor customer service! The police are here frequently. Garbage is dumped almost daily by the overflowing trash bins. There is trash often littered in the apartment hallways. The pool is closed or broken more times than I can count. Gym equipment is broken a lot of times. The pictures they post are deceiving. Of course the business office looks nice and the units with wood flooring (wood floors cost more). Get ready for door dings and scratches and parking issues galore!The laundry rooms flood with usage and machines are broken and go unfixed for long periods of time. The payment system is a nightmare. Their accounting is a nightmare. Honestly, shop around. You can find comparable prices and not go through the hassles that occur here. Once you get in...your complaints will go nowhere, hence why people try and speak up online. Don't do it!</Text>< Pictures>

Yes, this is a very large community that requires a lot of hard work to keep up the beautiful atmosphere. Our dedicated team of 15 employees work tirelessly every day to keep the grounds clean and all of our amenities in operation. We know that things may break down from time to time but have always taken the necessary steps to get them repaired right away.\n\nI also see you have other frustrations that I would like to address for our readers. We have a great relationship with the police department so yes, they do make their presence known at our community. The pool was upgraded top-to-bottom last year but has been open daily since last fall. May of our residents love the new pool furniture, heated water & bb-q pits. Out of our 24 laundry rooms on site, you can imagine that some machines may malfunction. We work closely with our laundry machine company to have them serviced quickly and there are always other laundry rooms available. The online payment system has been great success and a huge part of our effort to save trees by becoming as paperless as possible. As for the online reviews, we ask for our residents feedback with regular surveys sent from a third party that verifies reviews are from real Summer House residents. This feedback is used for planning ways to improve both our customer service as well as the physical attributes of our community.\n\nI welcome you to contact me directly so we can talk in person about these matters and share some of our planned improvements.

If I could give this place 0 stars, then I would. It is impossible to get anyone on the phone and when you do they promise to call you back the same day, but they never do. I have been trying to end my month to month lease and am not able to speak with anyone who can help me. I'm not available during office hours so I can't just drop in. I will definitely be reporting them to the BBB. Don't waste your time and money with this terrible place.<//Review>

The worst apartment complex ever. The management is even worse. They play a lot of games. When you have an issue to talk to them, they listen to you first, go to the another room in the office, talk to each other, and come with a very different decision you would never expect. The best thing I did was moving out. They made me very mad, even though I am not living there any more, I strongly recommend you to think reconsider moving there. It is not worth it. Trust me, you will have an issue, and they will disappoint you in the office. IF you don't believe me, read all of the reviews.<//Text>

I lived in summer house apartments in 2010. It's very sad to hear that after FIVE YEARS they still have the same problems and nothing has changed. From these reviews it seems to have gotten worse. Hands down, this was the worst place I've ever lived! Inadequate parking, poorly maintained, thin walls, rude staff, selectively enforce rules, extra charges when you move out (...doesn't matter how well you clean it).

Honestly the biggest problem is lack of parking space. Second is maintenance. All the inside common areas are gross. Third redo the insulation in the walls or something. Then again... A better solution is just to tear the whole damn thing down.< /Text>

My roommates and I are renting a three bedroom apartment. Renting an apartment was new to us but we had a great leasing agent. Ms. Deeba Uddin was extremely helpful, polite, and patient with the application process and helping us get our apartment. She continues to assist us still after living here for a few weeks. I am confident that anybody who has Ms. Uddin as their leasing agent will be well taken care of.

We are enjoying living here at Summer House. The location is great with many places to shop and great restaurants within walking distance. Our neighbors are quite nice and we enjoy the amenities available here!</text>

Never returned my deposit! They are crooks over there. Do not rent there. I have a mind to stand outside there leasing door and show everyone what they did and do to their tenants. Took over 4,000 deposit from us after a clean move out. They blamed the old management. As if that even helps the situation or releases them from the responsiblity? They claimed they would figure it out. Never did. Called back few times. They let it ring off the hook-never answer. So they have a lawsuit coming. They will regret stealing I'll take away their licenses. So Unethical! Strongly advise anyone thinking about moving here to think again. Theres way better places that have ethics unlike this place.

Worst apartment complex my family and I have ever lived in. A bad experience because of a variety of issues, such as terrible maintenance, high rent and high fees, greedy over-valuation of the property's worth, high crime and nonexistent security, as well as the fact that they are slowly pricing out even families who make $100k/year. Summer House has made it too expensive to justify renting from them while also making it exceedingly difficult to move out due to rapid rent increases of as much as $200/month, huge penalties for breaking a lease early, etc. Avoid at all costs. Contact me personally for greater detail, if needed.< /Text>

It is unfortunate they can still get people to rent here and pay the outrageous prices they charge, simply because they are in Alameda.
They continue to promote the good workers and managers out of here into other properties so nothing improves.
People screaming in the courtyards, trash everywhere, graffiti, and punks scoping out cars in the parking lot to break into.

When we moved in, fire alarms 3 times a week for the first month. No kidding, no exaggeration.

Called to let the office know the power was out in the kitchen, and my fridge and freezer were warming. They did nothing but string me along for 6hrs before telling me they were not going to fix it until the next day. The management determined it wasnt an emergency.
I am currently looking for a new apartment for when this lease ends.

Britnie from the leasing office is great! She has been very helpful and is always there to assist me! As far as maintenance, I really had no problem with them! They are quick to respond to all my maintenance needs. Security on the other hand needs improvement. For such a big compound, I think they should increase staff at least 1-2 more security staff patrolling the area instead of 1. Entrance and exit gates should always be closed, not like this weekend, exit gate on Buena Vista Avenue was open the entire weekend. :)< /review>

Staff are unprofessional as is this company, it takes months to have your deposit returned, dont expect any emails to be responded to and even if you can get through to leave a message they wont bother to call you back. Their are far superior options in Alameda ,I strongly discourage anyone from taking up residence here.<//Review>

My name is Marcus Thomson and I am the Community Director here at Summer House. The feedback from our residents is very valuable and used to continue making changes that really give value to those that live here. Thank you for your kind words about the office staff and I will be sure to share them with the team.\n\nI see that you have some frustrations over the speed of progress on the projects around the community and I share those frustrations too. With all 16 buildings being painted, all of the elevators being remodeled, the laundry rooms getting a make over & the pool area getting a face lift, it certainly seems like there is always something being worked on. The rainy season brought us some much needed rain but it did create delays in our progress. Let me assure you that we are working hard to wrap up these major projects so our valued residents, like yourself, can enjoy them.\n\nWe will continue to improve areas of the community and I want to thank you again for your input.

I love everyone at the office... Especially Britnie. However... Ive only been here 2 months and the elevator has been down for 3 days now. They replaced the washers and dryers, but who installs 3 washers and only 2 dryers in a room? Now i have to play guard so security doesnt lock up my laundry that i started 3 hours ago because i had to get in line.

To be fair... I see improvements happening, but wow they are slow.  There are a lot of little things that they could definitely put more effort into improving faster... Gates, paging systems, treadmills, garbage all over the place, etc.  I pay way too much rent to have to deal with some of the crap that i do deal with.<//text>

DONT GIVE DEPOSIT-THEY WONT RETURN IT! They took over 4k deposit that I have receipt and proof of giving them the check and they withdrawed it & at end of lease- never returned the money after move out. Spotless moveout/no damage. They claim the previous managment have the money and they would take care of it. Well guess what? They never took are of it. Never called back. Never pick up my phone. DOESNT EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR. I'm sure there are many bad reviews to follow with this kind of management running or should I say RUNING the place.</text>

The inside of the apartments are nice except for the heater that you have to shout over to hear each other. The problem is the unsafe complex. The "security" doors to all the apartment buildings never lock, so anyone can enter your building, plus people prop the perimeter gates open with sticks. If the complex would look at the bushes along the gate on Buena Vista they will see all the branches people break off to do this. I've talked to the office and they say there is nothing they can do, and the one security guard at night walks by people smoking weed, does nothing about the propped open doors, and spends more time on his cell phone than checking out the complex. Live here if you don't mind being in the ghetto of Alameda. There are plenty of other apartments that actually give you what you pay for.<//review>

I am not a resident, but a boyfriend of tenant. I have never seen a more unprofessional and unsafe complex in all of my life. The amount they are asking to rent  these apartments for, are not even close to the value you get. The 2 bedrooms should be 1300 not 2000. Grounds and amenities are unkept. Rodent issues are out of control. DO NOT RENT HERE..... Especially building 433.<//Review>

< Review>
This place is sad even with the new management. They charged me $50 bucks for a key to the apartments that i got made at Safeway down the street for $3.50. if you loose your key dont pay them just go make a new one in the machine 5 min away. i tried to return it and they gave me some sad story that they already ordered a new one and it cost so much money and they already cashed my check. This is a joke in one day you cant return the key with a receipt. On top of everything the guy in the front was very rude and talked down to me. The apartments are ok but this new  management is no better then the last. DON'T GET RAPED AND PAY $50 bucks! make a copy for much cheaper. Also they dont tell you this on the craigslist adds but you also pay for water and garbage broken down between all the units and that adds an extra $105 to you bill every month if you have 2 people living in the house.< /Review>

< review>
It was a bad omen when I went to the bank for a cashier's check for rent and deposit, and the teller told me I should tear it up find a new place if I hadn't signed anything yet.  These have been my negative experiences in the one year I have lived here:

1. My roommate and I voiced concern over parking on the tour.  Our guide said, "The 3 bedroom apartments come with 2 spaces."  This is an outright lie. The excuse: "Oh, sorry, he is new here."

2. We were told the prices of the apartments are all reflected on the website.  We applied for our apartment based on website listing, and then the contract was for $200 more per month.  Their excuse was, "Sometimes there's a significant delay between the website updates and actual rent changes, especially during the summer when there are a lot of moves."

3. After signing a lease for $200 more than expected and one fewer parking space, a new blank lease appeared in our email  a month later asking for even more money.  They said there was an error, and we weren't being charged enough.  They didn't push it after we pointed out this was blatantly illegal, but they still act like they're doing us a huge favor and we're just trying to scheme them out of cash.

4. There is a significant amount of noise at night.  I was particularly peeved one night when a car with a custom engine and very loud after stock muffler was parked below my window at 1:30 AM just revving the engine over and over again.  Then the guy left the doors open on both sides and BLASTED his stereo.  I was going to call security, but when I looked again, I saw that it was the security guard.  I had to be at work 5 hours later.

5. Management is in cahoots with some local towing company, and they call them immediately if anything is amiss.  If you need to unload groceries because you don't have enough parking spots that come with the apartment, you're gambling if it will be there when you return, even if it's only 10 min.

6. People like to dig through the dumpster below my bedroom window on a daily basis, and they can be rather loud at times, too.

7. There are loud children everywhere.  Make sure your apartment isn't next to the parking lot or the playground.

8. You are next to 2 schools, which is convenient if you have kids, but a pain around 8AM and 3PM.

9. There's a creepy old guy in the complex across the street who just walks up and down the sidewalk and calls police for people who are parked illegally, even if you tell him you just need to run a bag of groceries upstairs before you hunt for parking elsewhere.

Basically, I should have listened to my bank teller.  I'm moving in a week, and I can't wait.<//review>

I really liked living here. Here are the pros and cons:
Pros:
- Management office: People in the management office are very nice and helpful. I did not deal with all of them (they look very nice though), but I usually talk to Britnie, she is very very nice girl and very helpful. Always optimistic :)
- Price: Apartment price was very nice especially if u work in SF, though they require very good credit, and relatively high income to be able to live there
- Maintenance: They respond very quickly, usually less than 24 hours
- Facilities: Swimming pool, Gym, playground for kids, barbecue area
- Security: Place has gates and security guards at night.
- unit: has microwave and dishwasher
- Commute: bus station is 5 mins walk. 25 minutes Bus to SF, 5 mins to Oakland.

Cons:
- Washers are very good, but dryers were not that great. However, I knew that they will have pretty new washers/dryers on January 2016
- Sometimes, you hear people's footsteps above you, but its okay for me.
- Carpet in my apartment was not that new.< /text>

<review>Starting out, we moved here bc we were in a time crunch moving from a different city. Upon moving in there were several issues with the gates, parking, different issues with our apartments and rude management. The management was since been switched within the past 6ish months and is 100% better. New paint, parking lot and dumpster improvements, new hardwood floor in our apartment to replace the old carpet. We called for a simple light bulb problem in our bathroom, and they brought an entire new light fixture that was definitely an upgrade to fix the problem. The staff now is completely amazing and very quick to fix and help in anyway they can. Only reason its not a 5 is because I come from a town where you get what you pay for and this being such an expensive complex with all the upgrades (which are beautiful), i would Just like to see more patio or outside space or newer play equipment for the kids.< /review>< Pics>

Attention Marcus Thomson  and  staff, not too comfortable paying rent online in October 2016. My husband and I had some worst past experiences going online  and do not want to have nightmares about it again. Read reviews about money grams, too and they are the worst of them all. Too many hackers and scammers on the internet and it isn't safe and secure to go online at all.  We don't trust it at all.  You and your staff will be held responsible if anything worst happen to our rent online in October 2016.

<text>I went to take a tour of the facility tonight and had to give all kinds of information to even make an appointment with warnings about calling if I was going to miss it. I show up at the correct time, and everyone had left. After staring at me for a while, a maintenance man came over and asked what I was doing. I explained and he walked away. I followed him after a while and he said that he called Jeremiah and Cynthia with no response, they just decided to leave early and not call me, a potential tenant. I thought the place looked extra ghetto anyway and you could hear people screaming from the courtyard so it wasn't a huge loss. Just a huge waste of time. I'm not sure where they got the pictures on their broken website, it's much crappier in person.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808f80df1c7d8be3:0x9029d8150390492< /Gmap_id></record>

terrible management, the corporation that runs it also owns the towing company that tows cars. It is extremely ghetto and they continuously take  advantage of their residents.<//Review>

<Review>This place is highly disappointing. Tons of screaming unsupervised kids running around and almost run me over with there scooters.  The trash bins are constantly filthy with people moving out and abandoning furniture, beds, couches. The gate has not worked for months and so I am locked out on a daily basis until someone comes through. The grounds are pretty dirty, the halls reek of pot.

There are a lot of people who park in the parking lot during the weekend who are not residents and it fills up the lot, so no room for paying residents. They  need to enforce the parking rule more efficiently.

They are taking  advantage of the market right now. They are charging outrageouse  prices but are not providing the service nor quality they are charging for.

***I see that managment has responded to my review - the obnoxious loud noise is not just becuase of the Labor Day Holiday, it is a constant battle.</Review>< resp>
{'time': 1409757055295, 'text': 'Susan thank you for your review. We appreciate you continuing to call Summer House home. Due to the Labor Day holiday this past weekend, our BBQ areas, pool and tables were heavily used. Our team spent a lot of time cleaning the grounds yesterday from the weekend festivities. They will be focusing on the building interiors next. The gates have been repaired and we are working on upgrading the gate/remote software and telephone lines. I apologize if you have been locked out of the community. Please be sure to bring your remote to the office so we can reprogram or replace. We are towing vehicles if they do not display the proper permit. If you would like discus ways to make Summer House a better place to call home please feel free to email me at SummerHouse.CD@FPIMGT.com.'}</resp>

If there was 0 ratings I would give this apartment and the manager at the leasing office - he needs to change his job or get sacked. My car was towed from the apartment parking lot because I was on a temporary parking permit. And the towing company damaged (the front wheel) of my car in the course of handling/moving the car.< /Text>

<Review>Summer House is the worse place anyone can live, smells weed, mail boxes are broken frequently. The Manager ignores any complaint, no manners, customer service is terrible.

I have been lived here for last 3 years. Im just waing for a new place as soon as posible. but life keeps me busy on other things. I cannot wait to get out of here.
I live on third floor right next to the laundry room.
The apartment patrol guys need to check every building and make sure no one uses the laundry room after 10pm. Laundry room supposed to be locked after 10 pm. Apartment patrol guys have stopped checking on it for last 2years. every night everyone using laundry room in midnight. They dont care.  some teenager smoking marijuana in the laundry room I have called police many times.

I have called the leasing office to report this matter several times. unfortunately they are not even seemed concerning this issue. Once my neighbor arrested right in front of my hall way. No explanination or anything.

Just don't live here.<//Review>

2012 today ,10-26-2012 my car has been towed even the parking permit on it and i had to pay $370 for tow!!!
Tow Company is in San Leandro st in Oakland ( you dont even want to walk during the day in that area). Manager of the tow company threatened to key my car and he refused the scratches during the tow.
there is no difference living in here or east oakland......i am moving out  a, s soon as i can.

I beg you to please add your comments about Summer House Apartment Homes to
the BBB® - Better Business Bureau website. It's great that the information is posted here for all to see, but FPI Management is the Management company that is managing this complex. FPI Management has an A+ rating on the BBB site and that must change. Summer House Apartments has an F rating and the management company should have one also. Please help changing FPI Managements rating to an F rating
as there service and management practices deserves.</review>< rate>

<Review>I was very disappointed in the staff who abruptly cancelled our service today. I had always respectful to your staff; Wes is our favorite stylist.

Just remember, every issue has 3 sides - hers, mine and the fact.  The staff who cancelled our service today should be encouraged to receive some training in customer service.

I realize it's not easy to hire good employees today, some employers tell me it's hard to hire good people.  I understand it.  Quality should not suffer!

<text>Awesome team @ Citydog! Club Mountain View. We were a little nervous about taking our pup to her first day of daycare, but everyone @ Citydog! was so kind & friendly that helped ease our concerns. The ability to watch via live webcam & the report card at the end of the day are great features! The most important thing is that out pup really enjoyed herself and seems to be looking forward to going back.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl6ebdSfhZ9Gp65G7w3ZxhgF_AoXINMgmMXwwU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>{'time': 1623193600050, 'text': 'Thank You!'}< /response><GmapID>0x808fb1dbed742b25:0x4f1e8fe313c2c7a6<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We tried the grooming and boarding services at Citydog for our dog (Miles) and both times he came back happy and clean.
The grooming services are exceptional, Miles is still smelling great even after 5 days of the service and a couple dog park visits.
Miles also greatly enjoyed his stay at the Play Park with other dogs. We kept him there for over 20 hours and it was great to be able to watch him play through the cameras. Even though he needed to be corrected for his behavior the next morning, the staff only had great things to say about him and were happy to take care of him.
I love how they give a report card at the end with photos describing how your dog did during the service. They are professional and reliable, and I am glad we found this place. Miles loves them.<//Review>

CityDog was such a refreshing experience. Everyone was so friendly and so sweet to my dog Honey. I really felt comfortable leaving Honey to board with them. That is saying a lot. Will definitely use them in the future. They offer a wide range of services and are flexible with availability. They took Honey the week of for MDW, so that helped us so much!<//Text>

Perry at the reception was so rude. When I called yesterday at 11:38 am to inquire about their dog daycare and whether I need to make a reservation, the receptionist just told me to bring the dog over without telling me anything else. When I brought the dog over the morning of my graduation day, Perry told me without any courtesy that I needed to have the meet and greet session and the vaccine records. I was complete caught off guard and had to drive my dog home last minute and risk not getting to my graduation in time because there were no other option so last minute. When I asked Perry who the manager is, she told me there is NO manager here to keep her or whoever told me the false information over the phone accountable. Perry exemplified what it is to be rude and unapologetic for the company as a whole. Don’t get your dog there if you really NEED responsible dog care.</Review>

< Review>
I recently visited Citydog to go through their meet & greet and tour of the facility. My new pup hasn’t been around a lot of different dogs so I’ve wanted to check out this place for their daycare. I was blown away by the professionalism and personal tour of their building. The place is really clean, and I love the transparency of the building set up. You can see from the sidewalk the dogs playing and the employees watching over them. My husband and I decided to purchase a package based on the employee that took us around the tour. Rachel, who gave us the tour, was super polite, friendly, and reassured us our pup would be well taken care of and made us feel very comfortable; important for us since we are first time dog owners. I’m looking forward to taking my pup here for more visits and possibly boarding!</Review>

<review>Went in for a tour during their Grand Opening. I'm excited to have a new dog place in Mountain View and this place is clean, the staff are very friendly and my dogs had a great first day there! Their little online report cards were very cute, detailed, and complete with pictures. It is just a little more price-wise than the place we've been taking them, but the convenience of the location and the fact that they can stay and play until 9pm is worth it. We'll be visiting again soon for sure!<//review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Getting a puppy during a pandemic made me worried about her getting enough socialization.  I looked around for doggy daycare facilities and Citydog! Club was the most professional looking.  When we got there and did a meet and greet with our pup they were so kind to her and I could tell the people working there genuinely love dogs.  It made me feel confident leaving my puppy in their hands.</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< review>
I pass by Citydog! Club all the time just to see the cute happy pups playing inside, and just recently had the pleasure of taking my dog Lucky to have his first grooming appointment here! The online booking system was seamless and easy to use, and I actually greatly appreciate that the team took the time to check our pet vaccination record even if we were just coming in for a groom and not daycare/boarding. Lucky is a shy but sweet rescue boy who is usually scared around other dogs, and Westley took care of him with the utmost gentleness and kindness. I got both a courtesy text and call to notify me when Lucky was ready. I believe when the grooming is done but you haven't arrived yet, they offer the option of letting your pup hang out in the play area to make friends, but since Lucky is still working on his socialization skills, I marked on the online appointment form that I would like to respectfully decline this offer. When I arrived to pick Lucky up, he was brought to the front from a private separate area. This is another A+ for Citydog! Club because they (1) are kind enough to offer to let your pup have a short playdate while you're on your way to pick them up and (2) respected and paid attention to my request to let him rest on his own for today. As for the haircut, my Lucky looked so very handsome and happy! I truly feel that Westley and the team went above and beyond, and I would recommend Citydog! Club to anyone seeking top quality pet grooming with top shelf customer service. Lucky and I look forward to coming back real soon! :)</review>

The folks at CityDog were really great with my shy dog. They suggested the quietest time for her meet and greet appointment, and let me know they offer isolated breaks when dogs get overwhelmed. Highly recommended!< /Text>

We are new to the location and learned about City dog from a reliable friend, who is a frequent visitor for his dog for grooming, daycare and boarding. We took our dog for grooming and meet+greet session. The staff is very responsible sending out reminders about the appointment and making sure all the required information is in. The place felt good and was very clean and sectioned very well for different dogs to avoid stress esp. for new pups. The grooming was done on time and nicely, with a happy dog afterwards. The best part about the day care is we can see our dogies live during day time as they play . Also, i enjoyed pictures of pet during grooming that they shared with comments in the report sent out later. We highly recommend this place though it is little bit expensive.</review>

<Text>My 8 months lab Ellie was enjoying staying here and every time excited to come back and play with her new friends. Also, I really like the opportunity to watch her on the webcam so I make sure she is having a great and fun time. Thank you, City Dog Mountain View, for taking good care of my puppy.</Text><username>Christina Vlastiuk<//username><userid>116500606792628343356< /userid><gmapID>0x808fb1dbed742b25:0x4f1e8fe313c2c7a6<//gmapID>< rating>

We were able to check on her via webcam throughout the day so we were at ease. I would recommend their services to my friends!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>This place is awesome. Our fuzzy little boy has really enjoyed his time here so far. The team seems very attentive and loving with the doggos as well. We also had a good experience with grooming and nail trimming here, he came back smelling like blueberries for about a week, it was wonderful!
Being that my significant other and I are both nurses I wish they would open earlier since 7am is too late to drop him off, but other than that I think this place is great!< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Citydog Club in Mountain View did a superb job taking care of Lexi this weekend!  The staff were so friendly and professional.  We felt safe dropping her off, knowing they were following COVID protocols carefully.  Lexi later returned to us fluffy, groomed, and oh, so, happy.  FIVE STARS!  I highly recommend this place!< /Text>< gmapID>

Our dog loves this place!  He always has a blast and we know that he will be supervised and well taken care of.  I'm always impressed that they greet him by name when we arrive, even though he only stays there on the occasional long weekend.  Highly recommend!<//text>

We appreciate the transparency of the facility - where you can walk by the large windows to see the dogs (which also entertains the dogs too!) and the doggie cams that you can watch from home. It's a relief to know that our little puppy will be taken well care of while we travel. We couldn't be more confident in this place.</review></record></dataset><record>

Love bringing our pup here. He gets reports cards after every visit of who he played with. I can also spy on him through the webcams!

Staff is friendly, and very kind. I cannot comment on the bath or overnight since we have not used these services yet.< /text>

The staff are undeniably the most friendly staff and truly care about the dogs. It is super clean and the dogs are separated by size and energy level. Citydog is transparent in the way they allow you to watch your pup on video throughout the day and the front of the building is clear windows. My pup Oliver has the best time here in the play park and I would recommend anyone to this place :)< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< rate>

Don't hesitate to visit Citydog if you are thinking about doggy daycare or overnight services.  Citydog is very clean and they also offer spa services for your pet at reasonable prices.  They do everything from trimming nails to facials for your dog.  That's right facials.  Hamilton will be going quite often.<//text>

I love this place for my dog! I found this spot on Yelp and read great reviews but my experience there was even better! I scheduled a meet and greet and the staff was so patient and kind with my nervous dog. He seemed very comfortable when they took him to the huge play area! The whole area seemed very clean and my dog seemed so happy!</Text>

Our mini poodle absolutely loves coming here! He has the best time with the employees and the other dogs. They even send you pictures and a cute report card on how their day went. Along with this, you are able to watch your dog on cameras they’ve installed in the play areas. Our puppy also got groomed here and looks great!!</text>

City Dog came to be our last resort, and expecting the same mistreatment like previous centers we’d visited, we decided to prepare to groom our Chihuahua entirely at home. After our visit with City Dog, however, we won’t visit anywhere else. City Dog has incredible staff that greet both you and your dog enthusiastically at the door, and care for your dog throughout. After leaving our dog at City Dog for a wash and brush package, we returned around an hour later to find our dog had been washed, but his nails had not been cut and his glands had not been expressed. When we asked the City Dog staff why, they told us he’d been very defensive, and scared of being in a new environment. We asked the City Dog staff why they didn’t put a muzzle on our dog (as both our vet and other grooming centers had done), and they were completely against the idea; stating that they didn’t want to intimidate our dog, but make him comfortable and want to return again. We were taken aback - no center has provided us with the concern and care like City Dog. Their services are definitely value for money. We will definitely be sticking with City Dog - there’s no doubt about it. For anyone searching for safe, friendly, and valuable services, City Dog is for you.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Our dog is always happy when we get to CityDog and he looks fantastic when we pick him up from the groomer. He's stayed overnight once for 4 nights and while he was happy to see us when we picked him up, he didn't seem like he was in a hurry to leave - like he has been when leaving other places. The staff members are very friendly and the facilities are clean. I like that you get a report card with pictures at the end of the dogs stay and my only change would be to get these report cards on a daily basis when boarding.<//Text>

<Review>We tried Citydog! Club for the first time for a bath service for our maltipoo at the Mountain View site.  The employees were so friendly and knowledgable, and the facility was so clean!  The best part was the "report card" we received for our dog after the service was completed.  It had comments, recommendations, and adorable photos!  We loved our first experience at Citydog! Club so much, that we just took our dog to the nearest location in San Diego last week while on our extended staycation here!  Another wonderful experience!< /Review>< Pics>

After 5 years with a mobile groomer, I tried Citydog! Club groomer last week. My dog is a little timid so I was a nervous. They were really gentle with her, and she looked great when she was done! I only wish they had more available hours with such an excellent groomer!</review>

Clean and transparent facility with friendly staff! They gave a very thorough tour of the kennel, play areas, and grooming stations so that I know exactly the environment my pup would be in. Everything was sparkling clean. Drop off in the mornings is easy too. Plenty of curbside parking right in front of the facility.<//Review>

<username>Liv Lam< /username><userid>116133089750729287854</userid><text>We were driving down El Camino, saw Citydog Club, Googled it, read about it, and made an appointment to stop by (the same day) - all within 15 minutes!

Elena was super helpful and nice over the phone. When we got there, Lauren showed us around and gave our dog, Geronimo, some play time to see how he would do with the other dogs.

I love their cleanliness (it doesn't smell like dog whatsoever), they have 4 different play areas, and enough staff to take care of all the dogs. They will even provide a report card for your pup - just make sure to ask at the time of drop off!

This is the first time we've brought our dog to daycare and I felt comfortable and relieved knowing our dog was in good hands. You can even watch them play with their webcam link.< /text>< Response>

This Review is ONLY about DAYCARE SERVICES

My current puppy is my first ever pet so you can imagine (like a first kid), I overthink everything and only want the best for him/spoil him. My puppy has gone to various day cares since he was 10 weeks old an d now he's 13 months. I look for variety in facilities he is approved to go to (outdoor, indoor, pool time, types of dogs, you name it) CityDog! is by far the cleanest facility he has ever gone to and he has a great time. The staff and evaluators do a good job keeping the dogs with like attitudes and also allow the dogs to switch between play areas as appropriate. I also love that the play areas face the public street so that people walking by can peek in. Even throughout COVID, they have been ensuring they take all cautionary measures to limit any and all contact between humans. The staff wear gloves and masks when handling the dogs. They have also been allowing everyone to pre-purchase daycare packs at the new member rate to assist people in these uncertain times. For those who work long hours, they are open 7:00 am - 9:00 pm and work with your puppy/dog on taking naps to keep them at top shape and you can schedule mealtime during their day for a nominal fee.

Overall, this place couldn't have been a better find for us. I have also heard from a close neighbor that they have great grooming services as well at a competitive and reasonable price point.< /text>

Not only is the facility immaculate- that says a lot about the employees who are doing so much to MAINTAIN their beautiful hotel. * I’ve also worked at many dog boarding/daycares so impressing me is not easy.

Thank you again for helping me find a hotel that IS ABLE to cater to my dog because they don’t offer more than they can successfully do.
Also - report cards were the cutest-PERSONAL and  SPECIFICALLY about my dog :o

<Text>I left my pup here for 2 weeks and was very nervous because it's the longest I've ever left him (he is a high-energy pit mix and has separation anxiety). The Citydog team took such good care of him, sent lots of pics, and were super responsive to all of my questions and outreach. I've had a couple of very bad Rover experiences so finding this gem was truly a life saver and will 10/10 be returning!

I should add: I called over a dozen boarding facilities before I found Citydog! and was highly concerned to discover that the vast majority crate dogs ~6pm to ~8am and circulate them in and out of their crates throughout the day  for ~2-4 hours of daily playtime. I couldn't have left my dog in a situation like that in good faith, and was AMAZED that City dog lets the dogs play / roam free ALL day (something like 8a-9p) and if you don't pay additional for a nightly private suite (which I didn't) they get to stay in the run with the other dogs through the night. The unlimited play and nightly companionship was PRICELESS to me, but fortunately,  affordable here!</Text>< username>

< review>
LOVE this company. I've taken my chow chow to Doozydog in Washington, DC for the past 3 years and have always been very happy with the affordability and quality customer service. My family moved to the Bay Area last week and I was thrilled to see there's now a Silicon Valley location! My dog was transported across the country and was FILTHY and somewhat traumatized from the cross country drive. The team at Citydog took such great care of her - not just cleaning her up, but helping her to feel at ease after such an arduous trip. Can't recommend them enough!!!!</review>

NOPE! I checked it out because the prices seemed good but I will never bring my dog there. One dog section was left completely unattended and the other section the staff was screaming at the dogs to stop barking. Actually screaming. That's super not ok and she was clearly upsetting the dogs. They got as far away from her as they could, tail tucked, and obviously scared. The manager said and did nothing. The space was so small the dogs could barely move around. They offer dog walks which are extra so it ends up being really expensive if you actually want your dog move around while under their supervision.< /Text>

This is our go to groomer for our little Shih Tzu because they do such an excellent job both in caring for the dogs who are being groomed and paying attention to details in the grooming process itself. I love that it only takes about an hour for each grooming session and the dogs are hand dried, instead of being put into a kennel for hours while their hair dries. Our little pup is always in such a happy mood when she's done getting her haircut from Citydog! I highly recommend their grooming services!< /Review>

***Disclaimer, I never take time to write a review, but this review is necessary***

If you're looking for a doggy daycare/boarding facility, look no further. I'll start this by stating that prior to relocating to the Bay Area, I used to take my dog to Citydog's! other facility in San Diego. After relocating to the bay in January, I struggled to find a daycare/boarding facility to take my fur baby to. I was running into concerns where I felt my dog was either not 100% safe and/or well cared for. Other facilities also lacked cleanliness as well as looked more like a penitentiary.

On Wednesday 7/24, I received an email notification that Citydog! had opened a location in Mountain View. I immediately knew my struggle of searching for the perfect facility was now over. I showed up to Citydog! yesterday and both my dog and I were graciously greeted by the staff and provided a tour from the Regional Manager, Diana. This facility is beyond perfect and will exceed all of your expectations. The dog handlers were very friendly and upbeat. You can easily see that they take their jobs seriously and will provide the utmost care/love for your dog. After my tour, I can say that this facility is essentially the Ritz Carlton for dogs. Now I can take a much needed vacation knowing that my dog is in the best hands possible (a side from my own).

Thank you Citydog! Club- your core value of MTFL (make them feel loved) will be a staple in the Bay Area!

***UPDATE: recently read a review from a disgruntled customer and I can confidently say that no dogs are left unattended in the play park. There is a divider in between the large and small dog park. The handlers are taller than the gate and can easily view both sides from either park. The divider has a section that opens, so the handler has immediate access to either side. I would NEVER leave my dog at a facility that lacks safety. You can watch your dog on the webcam to prove it. Also, after being a highly satisfied customer of Citydog’s sister location in San Diego for over 2 years, it’s disappointing to read a meritless review. I love this new location and the amazing staff. We will be forever customers as long as we live here.</review>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>I really like this particular store. The staff is so friendly and always helpful. I will say though that the lines at the registers can be painstakingly slow, even when there's more than one person working them. That is a little frustrating to be honest. I took my two rescues to be groomed there today. First time I've ever used the grooming service at PetSmart. I'm very particular about who I let groom my dogs and they were fantastic! Not only did they do a wonderful job on both of them but they offer options other groomers don't. You pay extra for those options of course but even with the extra services I ordered, I still came out a hundred dollars cheaper than any of the other groomers I've used. Needless to say, I'll be a return customer.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Pet supply stores such as PetSmart are believed to be more expensive than local markets but that isn't true!
There are so many deals, discounts and sales in every category of pet care that If you chose those items you can really save money and have everything you need for your beloved pets. PetSmart does not carry brands or items deemed insufficient or inferior so you can count on every item being a positive addition to the wellness of domestic animals.
Don't be afraid to try PetSmart. It's fun to check out all the pet toys and all the items you have to choose from for your best friend.<//review>

Employees were pretty cool, only went to walk around my dog since it's cold outside, and even offered me advice and treats, I think we were there an hour legit walking aimlessly and it was nice of them for letting me do that<//text>

<text>Horrible. Waited forever for someone in fish.  Only for that someone to tell me they pushed a button and someone will be here.  Well no one showed so went to check out. Store manager opened a register for us and we told her and she could care less. At the end she said well goodbye. We will never go to petsmart again. #petcoisbetter</text><time>1611200204063< /time><rating>1< /rating><Pics>None<//Pics>< Name>

Bought a beautiful bird, a powder blue parakeet to accompany my loneliest little parakeet. And they don't call them lovebirds for nothing. The duo are perfect.
My lonely parakeet was a screaming Mimi before I brought him into the picture.
Bought a mirror perch for them and some nutritious seed.</text>

I am so impressed with the grooming dept!! I have a standard poodle so not the easiest to cut.   Being a growing puppy her hair matted easily.  Not only did they give her a beautiful cut every time we have gone but they also showed me how to brushed her properly to make the hair cuts easier.  She’s had 2 different groomers and both were just wonderful!!  Great price, great service, and the store is not the prettiest but all the staff is knowledgeable.  I had dietary questions and got a great answer with a great product recommendation.   On the outside Petsmart may not be as glitzy as the other place... but the staff, the products, the veterinarian, the groomers are ALL top notch❣️<//review>

< review>
We were traveling in our RV with out dog Nugget and he needed a bath. We normally bath him at home but it is hard to do in our motor home so we made an appointment for him. Apparantly our groomer had not showed up so there was a little delay until they squared the issue away but then took him and did a great job. Have always been happy with their service and have been to multiple locations.</review>

< Review>
Initiated online about 11:00 p.m. at night, ready by store opening the next day.  From the time I arrived at the curbside to the time I was able to leave seemed about five minutes.  When I called to report I had arrived phone answered immediately.  Wonderfully fast and convenient.< /Review>

< Review>
Terrible Manager  " Cory ".
I had visited the  Petsmart website and was interested in an item.
I had to leave the website but later on I received an email  from Petsmart saying  " If my tail  was still wagging; did I leave an item..." It was so cool that the  item  I was interested in was available so I  headed to the store just to find out that the item was not in stock ? NOT  what the  website said !<//Review>

So nice to have the grooming salon back open.  Due to the lock down, our boy Chewie, a miniature snauzher had to have a full clip and not his breed cut, but have him back on schedule for regular grooming and he will be back to his breed cut in no time.<//review>

Reasonable selection of products.  A bit more expensive than in some other stores/online. However, they work with shelters and rescues to assist with local adoptions and have a charity that supports sterilization and shelters, rescues and humane societies in general.</text>

Needed a light weight harness for my dog.  He was having a meltdown in the store, he was scared.  I was trying on a harness, a salesperson came along and assisted me with adjusting the harness and getting it to fit.  I doubt I would have bought one with my squirmmy frightened dog without her help.  Thank you!  I continue shopping at Pet Smart because their employees are genuinely helpful and nice!</review>

We love this location the staff is friendly and always welcoming.  We by supplies for our daughters Guinea pigs and we purchased Scratches and Polka dots at this location as well.  She has had them for going on 2 years.  We bought our son a bearded dragon at this location as well.  When we buy our items needed online it is usually ready in a hour sometimes less.<//Review>

<review>They welcome you and your pet by name. Dr Bandini is very caring and extremely knowledgeable, especially with my American Boxer, with heart issues.  Check into their Optimum Wellness plan, will save you money, in the short term AND long term care of your pet.< /review>< Pictures>

I will never going to take my god for grooming they’re not professional and make a disaster to the dog,they don’t know how to groom dogs hair by there breed,I take a photo and show them the style I want and ask the worker if she can do the style and she tells me yes and the manager was there to when I went back to pickup my dog it was a disaster and the manager told me I’m so sorry her hair will grow in two months and you can bring her back she was mocking me she was lucky y was in a good mood that day otherwise I wouldn’t think twice to slap her face.</review>

I just brought my two dogs to the Palm Springs groomers for a nail trim on Sunday. I was skeptical because I had read the horrible reviews, but this was my second visit and I found the two groomers to be very professional and helpful. They treated my dogs with care and respect. One of my dogs was a little nervous, they just helped to keep my dog calm and we all got though it. Thank you ladies!<//Text>

< Review>
I love PetSmart! I buy food, treats and litter every month for 2 cats that always comes within 3 or 4 dollars of the same amount each time though the brands I choose should add up to way more. There is always a major deal on one of the 3 and sometimes all 3. They'll have sales of high-end or unusual products that I like to treat them with as well.
This is a boutique pet store with prices less than my local chain market. My cats love Greenies and I can afford them for the whole month at PetSmart!<//Review>

Have a new puppy and went for supplies and an associate helped me find everything I had on my list.  When I went to check out, there was a line but two additional cashiers were called and check out went quickly.<//Review>

Grooming (an appointment is best!), However, they quickly took my baby back to check her anal glands. Nothing was wrong but irritated, so they recommended a product.
Very friendly and helpful staff!</text>

It is a typical big pet store with just about every brand of pet food available in the USA.  I have cats so i don't visit the dog side of the store.  The cat area is well laid out, easy to find whatever you are looking for.   If you cannot find something the staff will help you AFTER you find them.  I usually have to walk to the front of the store and ask a check-out clerk to use the P.A. system to call for help.  The staff is excellent once you find them.  Be persistent.</Text>

Its just your average Petsmart. I am giving them 4 stars only because their staff in general have  very poor customer service skills.</text>

I used to be a regular here. Even up until the last day I got to be with my little boy.  The night before he passed I went in to find a special toy or treat and the staff was incredible.  They were/are always incredible.  Knowledgable and friendly.  Big high 5 to them all.<//review>

I enjoy going to PetSmart as the staff there is a very friendly and has grown to really love my dog. I'm able to buy prescription food at prices lower than Petco. Oftentimes there treats and toys can be found less expensive than other places but if you watch for sales you can end up getting good buys on almost everything.</Text>

Staff has a willingness to help and just like with any other business that carries so much product it's hard to be knowledgeable on every single thing. I give them five stars because if they suggest a particular product and it doesn't work they will take it back, you can return it for a full refund.< /Review>

Tons of selection.  Adoptions are not handled by Pet Smart and you have to call a phone number and arrange a time to meet the people who actually handle the adoptions of cats.  Also, the adoption fees are very high for a cat.  Around $90.

Most items for sale at PetSmart can be found online for much less.</Review>

I stopped in to pick up à couple fish foŕ a friend.  It should have been a quick trip, however it was not.  They had a dog obedience class taking place right at the front of the store blocking shoppers of a couple aisles!  They also appear to be in need of more help for the wait to checkout was rediculous.</text>

<Review>Although it is a pricey store you get quality products for your precious pets because if you can afford it why wouldnt you only get the best for them. And they have everything at this one stop store for your pets needs. Even immunizations. They also have pet grooming. They even have your small hamster or bird and snakes needs. Visit the store theres one near you.<//Review>< Pictures>

<GmapID>0x80db1ceb9c67a6e7:0xeffd765230632dfa< /GmapID><Review>My favorite pet store in Palm Springs. I love to stock up on a variety of flavors of cat food for my picky cats. If you buy in large quantity on certain brands, you get an extra discount, which is nice. I like to stock up so I don't have to go too often. I have a Pet Perks card to take advantage of extra sales. They have a pretty good policy where if you want to experiment with a new pet food but you're not sure if your animal will like it, they promise to take it back even once you've opened it and they will give you a full refund if you just bring your receipt. It's a great way to try out new foods without any risk. I really like that because it allows me to try different foods so my pets don't get bored.</Review><user_name>Dominique Fruchtman<//user_name>< user>

I get all my pet food and supplies here. They have everything I need. Pet adoption is also done here on the weekends and some week days. Kittens from Kittyland Cat and Kitten Sanctuary are brought here during kitten season and they get adopted fast.< /text>

It's such a relief to know that I can find all the quality foods, treats, toys, tags, etc. in one place. I also get my dogs' nails done there - I trust their gentle handling of my old guy and my young kooky girl.<//Review>

< Review>
I have had great and not great experiences there. Most recently I bought a toy listed for $8 and the price tag didn't scan so Amber decided to charge me $16.50 even though I explained and showed it was oviously not the same toy. I also had her sell me 12 crickets for the price of 18 and when I said that it was short she told me I miss counter.< /Review>

I recently purchased 25 crickets @¢.15each for my reptile, and a couple happen to die within 3 hours. This is the 3rd time this happens. So I called the store and they said: There's nothing they can do.  NOW  I'll rather drive 5 miles further to get good quality food for my reptile than bad quality. I'll take my business to PetCo.</Text>

<Text>My dog is 18 years old and needs medicated food. Unfortunately for me the only Petsmart that carries it is the location in Palm Springs. I actually have to pass two PerSmart stores on the way to Palm Springs to get the food that she was prescribed by Banfeild.
Service is good, just wish they would carry the same products in every location.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>This pet supplier has most brands for domestic pets. I have dogs and cats that I shop for food and supplies. I gave them 4 out of 5 stars as they don't give out coupons for X-$'s off your next order through their  Pet Perks program like they use to do. Also, they have uninformed staff for sale items or special offers.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80db1ceb9c67a6e7:0xeffd765230632dfa<//GmapID></record>

It has a second star just because the staff here is actually pretty nice. But I'm sorry a store that has a zero return policy with out a receipt? Things happen and sometimes you lose the receipt. I have a lot of receipts from here as it's the only place I shopped until now. I have two items that are junk. One had dust on it when I bought it and I know why after buying it. It didn't work as it said it would. But even though I shop here all the time they wouldn't do anything not even store credit. So if you know you will never have an issue where you need to return an item then feel free to shop here but if you have an issue just know you will get zero help.</Text>

Took my dog in for training.. Paid 120$..... And got 1 class out of it, because the trainer apparently quit but it took management 2 weeks to let me know that she had done so. As a matter of fact the only reason I found out she had quit was because I had shown up for a class and after waiting for 15 finally asked where she was and the manager said "I'm sorry but she quit,  she didn't tell you?"  shouldn't he had called me as the manager?!!  Oh well not a good store for training or buying pet supplies to expensive..< /text>

After a lengthy online booking process to schedule my dogs grooming appt. I get a call from the groomer asking if would change my appt to the next day at 1:30
I said sure, changed my calender appt schedule.
Well the next day they tell me my dogs grooming appt was cancelled because the appt was for 12:30. No other openings.
Screwed!

(Translated by Google) There are many kinds of things here, including snakes, turtles, and fish. Better yet, there is a hospital right next to it. If there is a problem with your pet, you need to answer any questions. You can directly ask the staff, he will tell you in detail that you need to know how to raise. Very convenient.

這里的东西种类很种类很多，蛇，乌龟鱼都有，更好的是还有一个医院就在旁边，如果你的宠物发生了什么问题，有什么问题须要解答。都可以直接问工作人员，他会很详细的告诉你要你知道怎么样去养。很方便。<//text>
