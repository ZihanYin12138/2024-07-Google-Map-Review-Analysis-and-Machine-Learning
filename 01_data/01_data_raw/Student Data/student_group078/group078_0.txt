<Review>Limited food menu during the evening. What they do offer is really good and perfectly sharable. We got an order of fish tacos that came with three and chips with guacamole. The ambiance of the place was super chill as well with lounge chairs set up in groups. With covid 19 regulations they keep everyone distanced but it didn't have the feel of having to be separated. They also would come and clean everything with disinfectant once a group left.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80d9535a2fa28d19:0xc8c7c48208bf936e< /gmap_id>< resp>

Pendry pool house is awesome! Go during happy hour at 4-6 and you get $1 oysters! Be fore warn though it takes awhile for your oysters to come out, so get there early and order them asap! Their cocktails are super awesome. It's delicious! About $14 a piece. Hot wings were fried perfectly and spicy. Pools have lounging chairs, beds and cabanas. Cool space. It's not too big though, but have a popping bar.<//text>

< review>
Came here for a Happy Hour a few months ago. The scene is great, the layout and ambiance as well. However, the wait for the food was outrageous. We waited an hour to get a lobster roll and some sashimi and oysters. Everyone was nice and apologetic, but it was still irritating to wait so long nonetheless. The food, once we did get it, was quite good. I especially liked the sashimi and lobster roll. I'm sure we'll come back again, but probably after the summer rush, when the kitchen flow can be more manageable.<//review>

<rating>3< /rating><Review>Beautiful rooftop restaurant. Lovely Décor and view. It's a great place to go to enjoy the weather, people watch, and grab something eat (if it arrives). My friend lives just a few blocks away, and we were starving after a visit to the USS Midway. Although he comes here often for dinners and events, he had never been for lunch. Long story short....our lunch took about 50 minutes to arrive. We ordered the Poke and Avocado Toast as appetizers. Sadly all of our dishes arrived at the same time.... yes, even the Avocado Toast. We also had the Tacos and Buffalo Chicken Wrap. The food is decent, but I'm not impressed with the service here. We quickly ate our lunch and left. What we thought would be a short lunch ended up taking much longer, and we had a dog to walk.  Our server had to fill our iced teas more times than I can remember.

To make up for the long wait for our food, the server didn't charge us for appetizers. That was nice of them. I think they could have done better with the food situation. There were a whole lot of staff walking around. Most of them looked like management. It even looked like they were have a little meeting near the bar.

Did I mention that all of their servers are attractive? I wonder what their interview process is like. Do they show up in swimsuits? :-) lol.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOp6M66c8457MuW513BJNc83H8e4TdUBQ5zz64=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx-gVnrPLRLqmFmymqRZK5PeWHvXf9qCIbYOI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>Ate lunch here while on a work trip. Midweek it wasn't busy at all and the service was great. We sat by the bar which overlooks the pool and we had a great time. Lunch prices weren't outrageous and the portions were generous. I would definitely go back again!</Review>< UserId.>

My second time at the Pool House.  It is beautiful and the food is good.  Just be prepared to wait and spend awhile.  The service is super slow and the reorder for drinks takes forever to get someone’s attention and even longer to get your drink.  So my advice is if you have some time to kill and want to hang out this is a great spot. Just order two drinks at a time so you don’t get thirsty waiting on the service.<//Text>

<Review>Attended a party here. It was very well done and this place created a nice setting for pockets of conversation and easy relaxing but still professional environment. The staff was very attentive and kept trays of food coming. I was also impressed with the bartenders who with a limited bar menu were able to keep up with the incoming requests. BUT when it was time to go the bouncers were no nonsense when they informed us in no uncertain terms that we had to go and go now!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I stayed at the Pendry for a work event and was fortunate enough to spend some time at The Pool House. I tested the hot tub and was pleased that it wasn't unpleasantly hot. We ordered chips and guacamole and got to eat while in the hot tub. We also got the tuna poke bowls which was incredible and I highly recommend it. The scene is very diverse, people of all ages and races. Our service was great and we felt like royalty. Would highly suggest this place if you're looking for a cool atmosphere!</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I'm actually sad that such a nice place can be so disgusting. The place has beautifull women, if you catch the right time. The pool is for guests staying at the hotel; even if a person spends a generous amont on dining. Staff was over the top rude and I had better service from a Wal-Mart Grocery Store. The hotel policy states they are not bias nor due they discriminate. I was asked several times if I was going to pay, because I got up several times using the restroom. Got tired of being harassed by the staff that it esclated to security. Guess what thanks to the level of unnecessary escalation the 214.68 bill on the house. Just a tip don't come to this place looking a bit thuggish or homless. If you do just make sure to order and eat the food before security give you the boot.< /Text>

<review>The name is deceiving as is their website. I went there on a Sunday with out of town guests thinking it would be relaxing to do their advertised Sunday "pool party." Well they don't allow non-hotel guests to use their pool or even lounge near it, so you're confined to a small uncomfortable area to eat mediocre overpriced food.  Seems to be a new policy based on what others have told me. Staff is stuck up and fake to boot. Never again.<//review>< Response>

< Review>
We live in downtown SD and decided to check out this place for a few drinks. As we were leaving, a waiter stopped us by the elevator  ( mind you not our original waiter ) asking if we paid. OF COURSE WE PAID!!!!. And why would you even ask that. We were definitely profiled bc we didn't "look the part".  Don't judge a book by its cover. You really did lose a potential loyal customer due to your rude judgmental service.  I will never return.</Review>

<Text>They know their tools and are always helpful.  They will give you the best prices they can. This is where you go to buy tools. Only the best tools sold there.  Makita, DeWalt, and Milwaukee. With a match any price guarentee. They are seriouse about tools. You will be happy you checked them out. Forget about Home Depot they have a greater selection, and you wont risk the chance of buying a returned product like Home Depot. They have everything you could imagine, on hand. You dont have to wait for ship to home. They have it there. If you're  into tools or looking for a tool this place is Disneyland< /Text>< GmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Just found this place. I went in to get a tool bag that no one else in town had and found a bunch of other stuff that I wanted at half the price of anywhere else! They have a huge selection of power tools and other types of tools. I bought a battery for my cordless circular saw for $50, they were $99 everywhere else. Josh was very helpful. I definitely recommend checking this place out.<//text>< Pics>

Horrible customer service! I wasn't greeted, no one acknowledged me, they were not busy only two people in the store. They spoke to the them but not me. I was browsing with my 3 year old for a long time and wasn't asked if I needed help, I was ignored. So we left and went to Home Depot to spent over $300 on tools. Thanks Fasteners for the disappointment in your service.< /review>

Spent $1200 on Makita Cordless tools during their "Makita Month"  you got 1 raffle ticket for each $100 spent. I took the day of the drawing off work and drove down to their location. I was told they would do the drawing closer to noon so I called at 1230, still no raffle. I was told they would do it by the end of the day. 520pm I call again, still no raffle. Next day I call and am told they will try to get to it by the end of the weekend... end of the weekend still no raffle so I sent an email to corporate and asked about the raffle, they said they needed to pool tickets from another location(even though their flyer said the sacramento location had it's own drawing) next day I call and they did the raffle with no notice and so noone could be there. I'm assuming they rigged it and chose the winners, who trusts a raffle they aren't allowed to be at. I'll never give these dishonest folk another dime.< /text>

{'time': 1596686331850, 'text': 'Hey David, sorry about the poor communication about the raffle. It seems you thought we were going to do a drawing at a certain time, so that the people who entered could be there - we didn’t have a set time to do the drawing, and we hadn’t planned on having the people who had tickets show up, since we had well over 2,000 entries. I can assure you we didn’t rig the drawing though! If you’d like some more info about how that process happened, please give the store a call and ask for Josh! Sorry again about the miscommunication.'}<//response>

<review>Not near much else but a little gem of a place. Tired of taking it up the $!%# at Home Pito or frustrated with the selection at Blowes? If you like having the latest selection of name brand tools and feel like saving almost half the cost for the exact same tool just Shop at this joint they have friendly staff who go the extra mile to help and on weekdays they’re open at 6 am which I find very convenient since I work during the rest of the day. They also Have a variety of fasteners other places don’t carry<//review><date>1526666531142<//date>< rate>

Not near much else but a little gem of a place. Tired of taking it up the $!%# at Home Pito or frustrated with the selection at Blowes? If you like having the latest selection of name brand tools and feel like saving almost half the cost for the exact same tool just Shop at this joint they have friendly staff who go the extra mile to help and on weekdays they’re open at 6 am which I find very convenient since I work during the rest of the day. They also Have a variety of fasteners other places don’t carry< /text>

These guys are awesome, excellent selection, fair prices, and a great online presence. I live in a different part of the state and Nathaniel made it super easy to take advantage of their outstanding service. Keep up the good work!< /Text>

<Review>Best place to get tools. The prices are amazing and they have a great selection. This place is way worth the drive. I live in Shingle Springs and will come here for tools before any big box store.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Not only amazing service but great orices.  I bought a combo Dewalt table saw and stand   On sale at home Depot for $549 and they beat the price by $50.  Two dewalt 5.0 ah 20v batteries were 199 at HD and they had them for 50 eaxh.  New.   They also have on display more tools than any other store so you can play with them and try them out. Will definitely continue giving these guys the opportunity to sell me my dewalt tools.  glad they finally opened up a Sacramento store.  😍😍😍 follow my Instagram page at @iheartcarpentry</Review>

{'time': 1532887512382, 'text': 'We’re sorry to hear about this David. Unfortunately, because of the long lines of people waiting when we opened, things were a bit more hectic than we had anticipated, and a few items were sold out very early on. If you’d like to shoot us an email or give us a ring with what tools you were hoping to buy, we can give you the sale prices on them! If it’s something we sold out of, we are usually back in stock within a week. We never want anyone to have a bad experience in our store!'}<//response>

<Text>I was in the store about a month ago to make a purchase of a DeWalt tool. I wanted to buy some other stuff but was told that they are having a huge DeWalt sale on 28 July. So I waited 4 or five weeks. Came back today walked through the doors at 0905(they opened at 0900) and they were already sold out of the saw that I wanted. Also the weed trimmer that I was told was going to on sale was not. My time was wasted, by this store's poor planning and poor teatment of customers. I will not do any more business with this store. And don't recommend this place either.</Text></record>

<rating>4< /rating><text>Highly recommend the Tandoori Mixed Grill (which is not on the menu) and the garlic naan. I would give this place 5 stars, however, their curries are lacking flavor and spices.

Ask for Alex when you arrive. He is friendly and always has some great recommendations on what to try.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc5CrgynAbCzSGdllyHq1kILb-w-gI_7YzGT6S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

<review>Had been here for evening drinks and snacks which was good. Came back for buffet. Food selection is decent, not much different from any other bay area Indian buffet at this price point. 4 stars because some of the food items were not warm even though we arrived by noon.

Updates from 10/08/2019: changed the rating to 5 star. Visited this place again for evening drinks and family dinner. Great food (I would let pictures do the justice) and enjoyed the service. Will definitely come again for this experience. It does seem like evening menu based food/service is different (much better) than other forms like lunch buffet.</review><user_id>105796631361410977498<//user_id>< username>

Great ambience. Good selection of items during lunch buffet such as biryani, fruit, chai, butter chicken, idli, pakoras. If you're a fan of chutney their tomato and mint is very thick and flavorful.< /review>

<Review>Came for lunch with a large group, and everyone enjoyed the food at the lunch buffet. Good selection of vegetable dishes and meat plus salads. All the typical dishes: paneer, daal, tandoori chicken and tikka masala. Plus others I don't recall but very good. Fresh naan delivered to the table. They are good at bringing more water since some dishes are spicy. None are incredibly spicy but there's many sauces you can add. They had two desserts: shredded carrot cake and cafe mousse. After Yelp check in it was only around $10 per person before taxes and tip! Great deal and good quality. Not too crowded.

Definitely recommending and coming back!</Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Gmap_id>

Sunday noon buffet $13.95.  Decent place. Multiple chicken dishes... Tandiori, butter and with cilantro and chilli pepper  chicken ... wish there was some variety like fish pakora 🤔

Chai was good but cups were sized like medical specimens and tiny<//Review>

This place is quintessential Fremont - and I love it! Wife and I had dinner and drinks at the bar, which offered the full dinner menu. The bartender knows how to mix a mean cocktail. If you're a fan of the negroni, he won't disappoint.</review>

We finally made it over to try the new Urban Spice restaurant and really loved every single dish. Some were a little spicey, but we are total babies when it comes to spice. The waitress brought some cucumber yogurt to put on top, which helped with the spice and made the dishes even better. You have to try the date naan, it's not even on the menu yet, but it is the best! Also, I recommend asking for some chutney if you order the pesto paneer. And of course the chicken Tikka masala was on point!< /Text>

<Text>We celebrated our daughter's 1st birthday party here.. the food was appreciated so was the banquet hall but the overall management was poor. Food was not served till 12.30 when party start time was 11.30. The manager told us at 2.45 PM to end the party at 3PM. The next party was already allowed to enter before we wrapped up our party and kept pushing to take our stuff and clear the area ASAP. The beginning and end of the party was a chaos. Expected more coordination from the mgmt.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

We ate at the buffet & loved it! I am not familiar with a lot of different styles of Indian cuisine & I am gluten intolerant. I was impressed with the chef, who came out of the kitchen to go over the menu with me, when I was at the front counter, inquiring about the g f. options. After entering the restaurant, & seeing the extensive buffet, I hesitantly asked about the g f. options. Again, the chef came out of the kitchen, went around the buffet to each option. He was kind, and very helpful. Later, another person explained the sauces & what foods were best with each.... without my even asking. We thoroughly enjoyed the food, and the opportunity to try different foods. We enjoyed the open, friendly attitude of the staff. The price was very reasonable. We will be back!<//Text>

I came here with my fiance on a Saturday afternoon. It was great! The atmosphere is open and comfortable. We enjoyed the tasty Indian buffet. Then we relaxed at the bar and had some drinks. The owner and the bartender are also pleasant and friendly people. We will definitely be back.<//text>

Still a new place so hopefully a chance to improve. Very chill and casual. Had a few drinks at the bar and chopped it up with the bartender. Nice guy. Looks new, but very personable. Just a tad too cold in the room as well. Hoping for music for atmosphere, or sound from the bar TV. Will definitely be coming back.<//Text>

I thought the food was just okay. Most of the items were almost finished when I got there and nobody was filling the containers with the hot food. Little bit disappointed by that. I can understand the crowd makes it harder to manage but this is something very basic.
I did not feel like taking more food on the plate since I was just going to scrape the last bites of everything.
I will have to come here again to see if anything changes otherwise that will be it.
Food itself was decent but not extraordinary than any other buffet.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1557860996867, 'text': 'Thank you Anand and appreciate your candid feedback.

Amazing food. Stop by for Sunday lunch buffet and found worth it. We start with some appetizer veg - Chinese noodles, cut mirchi, veg manchurian and non-veg tandoori, lamb cutlet. The cut mirchi was so crispy and juicy that i can tell on the spot that it would be fresh and just served for buffet. Same experience with tandoori. I hv never tested this soft and well marinated tandoori. It melted in my mouth. Nan was so good, 3 of us ordered 4+. Service is also good. Even after kitchen closed they served one extra nan with no extra charge. To visit again they gave us 15% coupon. Restaurant was clean and got parking.
Will definitely visit again<//review>

This lounge is in the same building as Urban spice. We went to have some casual drinks and snacks. We shared the lamb sliders and garlic fries. Food was aromatic and tasted good but with an Indian interpretation of sliders and garlic fries. They had craft beer and wide liquor selection. I had a pint of shadow puppet's Hazy ipa and an old fashioned.
Bar tender was great an even asked if we wanted a certain music player to be most hospitable.<//Text>

I tried the buffet at this place. Liked the food very much. Indian style naan is served in the place. And you can request for hot and fresh  naan to the table directly. Very friendly staff and Kid friendly environment. Will be back here for dinner.<//Review>

We went for a buffet on a weekday after getting very good feedback from my friend. The food was ok but it was not hot, everything including sambar was cold.
Please try to keep the burner on and make sure the food is hot during buffet.</review>

This restaurant is pretty amazing. Nice space, friendly staff and authentic taste.

We ordered garlic naan, paalak paneer and London chicken along with masala dosa. They customized dosa Jain for my mom. Taste was on point. Staff was very friendly, Owner came up and checked up on us cpl of times.

I would definitely go there again and highly recommend it.<//text>

My rating is for chicken biriyani, since I only had that from this restaurant.

It is watery and chicken is half cooked. I would avoid this place if you are thinking of ordering chicken biriyani here.<//Review>

Very bad service. Totally unorganized for large group. They made us sit in the bar area for food, but just one server in the whole area. Food delivery was really really really slow. We literally had to struggle to get food on table. After ordering the food the waiter came back after 20 mins and said the kitchen is closed. That's pathetic service. I mean seriously???
Never gonna come back here again. Whatever they served us wasn't that great either. Just an ordinary testing food. I dont recommend this place for group bigger than 7-8 people.<//Text>

I'm honestly not the one to give bad reviews and try my best to air on the side of giving positive reviews but this one I just have to say it as it is for the sake of others.

Customer Service/Ambience:
The customer service was good and everyone was nice, the ambience was good as well except it was freezing in the restaurent and even though when I did notify the waiter and the waiter did turn it up a bit (which Haha he hilariously turned it up to 58 degree, I could see it cuz I was sitting right across from the thermostat, I was like whaaat how cold was it before then) but even after that it was still terrible. At one point me we had to stop eating cuz our hands were really cold especially since we were eating with our hands.

Food:
Now the food, I really liked the menu and was really optimistic it would be good. We ordered 3 items 1 appetizer chicken, 1 entreé chicken and 2 biryanis chicken/goat. The food came out quick and on time.  The moment I took the first bite from each of this dishes it had a strong poultury taste and chicken was undercooked and that really killed my entire experience. And the goat was chewy and not well cooked either. The foods sauce and gravy was good but with the meat being this bad for all 4 dishes  it became a really unpleasent experience, then you add to that the freezing temperature at the restaurent.. just > :(
I even had an stomach ache that night. I'm sorry but I would never be coming back to this restaurant.</Text>

<text>I had such a horrendous experience here. I was getting the food while talking to my wife on the phone.

<rate>1< /rate><text>Worst service ever seen. Totally unorganized for large group. They made us sit in the bar area for food, but just one server in the whole area. Food delivery was really really really slow. We literally had to struggle to get food on table. After ordering the food the waiter came back after 20 mins and said the kitchen is closed. That's pathetic service. I mean seriously???
Never gonna come back here again. Whatever they served us wasn't that great either. Just an ordinary testing food. I dont recommend this place for any one... You will get nothing to eat even after waiting for couple of hours.

Never Ever Go Their !!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Awesome place! The food was great we ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and they ask you how spicy do you want it, we asked for mild it was just right. We also ordered the Chicken Biryani and it was amazing. The bar next door is also a nice place to hangout and the drinks are priced reasonably.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Time>1545356027527<//Time><rating>1< /rating><text>Food : We ordered Kadhai Paneer, Dal Makhani and garlic naan.Kadhai Paneer and Dal Makhani were cold and stale.
Felt like it's been in refrigerator for couple of days.

Ambience: Ambience is nice but Restaurant was super cold.It was very hard for us to sit there for 30 mins.They turned on the heater when we asked for it but it takes time to heat up the restaurant.

Service: Service was fast because they are serving stale food.

Price: Given the food they serve price is high. $14 for Kadhai Paneer better go to Amber and pay extra $3 for good Kadhai Paneer

Went on Mother's day Weekend and it's complete Chaos. After waiting for 20 minutes, Almost everything in the buffet is empty. Everyone is waiting for either curry or plate.
Don't recommend to anyone. Nothing was amazing everything remaining is also average.<//Review>

Just tried this place, it's great! We ordered the Gobi Manchurian and it was delicious! We had it up a level in spice and it was great! Good heat and nice tangy flavors!

We found the house Pinot noir happened to be my favorite wine at home, Mirrassou brand! I think the house cab, is LaPlaya still good too.

We tested the Lamb sliders, they we're good nicely cooked not overdone good mild spiced flavor.

Overall service was great! Our bartender was really nice! Hope this place stays around, it's so nice to have a tastey place right down the street.<//text>

Liliana at the front desk of Urgent Care was down-right rude. Definitely NOT the "Sutter Difference"! As someone who has worked for Sutter we are taught to treat our patients with kindness, and compassion. Snarky behavior has no place in a Sutter building- let alone at the front desk (your first impression of an office). The saving grace at this point was Amber, the nurse. She was pleasant, professional and treated my child as a valued patient.< /Text>

I've been here twice the past week and a few times before that, I've never had a single problem. Nicest staff, smart nurses and doctors, didnt even have a horrible wait time. It's a lot harder to get positive reviews than negative, so I dont think a 2.6 star average is remotely accurate.< /text>

They use the same radiologist at the hospital ER, which gets priority over the urgent care. Your wait will be the same several *hours* and at least you’ll get an MD at the ER vs the urgent care’s two family medicine MDs or two PAs. The front desk staff are rude, unhelpful, and lack empathy.

<review>Waited12 hours to fill an antibiotics prescription for an infectious injury and nothing. Our regular pharmacy was closed for Labor Day, so I requested the Rx be sent to the 24hr CVS that’s 30 mins away. Never happened. We drove 30 mins each way for absolutely nothing. No antibiotics, urgent care stopped answering their phones.
They never took the time to request the prescription with the 24 hr pharmacy. Now we have to go the ER!! BS!< /review>< Date>

<Review>With a name like "Urgent Care", you expect a certain speediness to the care. I've come to the Roseville location with an ear infection. I'm in pain. I checked in nearly an hour ago and have been told it will be "at least another 20 minutes." They haven't even called in a patient in the last 30 minutes. Just like almost everything else with Sutter, I am not impressed. It would've been faster to go to the ER.< /Review>< UserId.>

<Text>My daughter broke her finger at work but the contracted urgent care for her employer was closed.  The two ladies at the front desk were absolutely horrible.  They would not see my daughter and sent her away twice even though we offered to use our personal insurance.   Not sure how it’s possible to turn an established patient with insurance away but she sure did.  When we were finally able to get her to understand that we are using our personal insurance we took a seat in the waiting room and could hear her and her associate talking about us..  She spend so much time talking about us that she didn’t have the paperwork ready for the dr when my daughter was called back. When we were at xray we were told that she had entered the wrong hand and finger in the paperwork .  It was a very frustrating visit to say the least.</Text>< date>

Went to Urgent Care 12/1 prepared for a long drawn out visit. Was so pleasantly surprised at the WONDERFUL customer service and the quick in and  out service. The entire staff could not have  been more helpful and
Dr. McGahan was great at explaining my problem and the procedure that was needed to help me. I arrived around 8:45, admitted at 9:00 and out the door  a little before 10:00.<//text>

First time going here with an infant they had us wait so long after our visit that we left. Second time going with her being a toddler they told me she just had a virus and to go home only to find out 2 days later she has pneumonia. Both times we felt like staff didn't care and wrote us off as worried parents. Love Sutter but don't go here, they don't give a damn.</text>

Whatever the wait time shows on their website, multiply it by 3 or 4. Wait time was 45 minutes when I checked in and I am still sitting here 2 1/2 hours later with no know time of when I'll be seen. I've been "next" for the past half hour.

It would be quicker to just go to the ER.<//text>

<Review>I'm a long time Sutter Roseville fan, had all my followup for my heart surgery done there. My wife went through breast cancer treatment there, so logically when I cut my finger severely, went to Urgent Care for help, maybe some quick stitching if necessary, but was turned away because I had to have approval of my Primary Care doctor. Sort of pissed me off more than a little. You can be sure I will pass this on to everyone I know, and by the way, my wife died in your hospital 3 months ago  with a cancer recurrence. I will probably end up going to emergency to get the care you could have done in an hour.< /Review>< userid>

<review>I have been to many urgent care facilities over the years. This one is by far the best.  In fact, I finally left my previous primary care physician when I realized that I was getting better from this clinic than I was from him.  I have never experienced an overlong wait time - nothing compared to my experiences at other Urgent Care franchises in the area. And there has only been one time at this facility when I wondered if the doctor seeing me was there because he couldn't get a job anywhere else. One doctor out of at least 5 that I have seen here.  As opposed to 100% of the doctors that have seen at ???-7.  Furthermore, both the doctors and admitting nurses here are courteous and professional.  You can honestly describe what they do here as medical CARE.  In fact, when given the choice by my employer whether to switch from Sutter to Kaiser for my insurance, I chose to stay with Sutter largely due to the care received at this and other offices in Sutter Medical Center.  This is your best option, in my opinion, for unscheduled care.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I had THEE WORST experience ive ever had at a sutter location right here at yours truly, the Roseville Sutter Urgent Care, and i have been a sutter patient my entire life.

There was such a lack of care for my pain that i just wanted to run out, completely disgusted and feeling worse than when i had arrived.

Pain is what the patient says, and the doctor acted as if i were making it up because i am young and kept interrogating me about my level of pain as if to discredit me and how I WAS FEELING, which she could not have possibly known for obvious reasons.

For another concern of mine, she said for that other thing youve been feeling on your ribs i dont know what that could be thats weird (in my mind im screaming "what" at this point and almost out of my mind but still remain polite)

She told me to walk to the emergency room where they sent my mother to get A SHOT and that i would have no problem makong it there since it was only across the parkning lot, the street, another parkinglot and down a lengthy allyway, AFTER i told her it even hurt to take a step because i was there for a terrible back pain and couldnt even wlak the day before despite medication i had taken.

Im a very stubborn person and had been experiencing pain for months but had only just attempted to reach put for help because it had become unbearable and my pain was ignored and unimportant

I felt completely uncared for, defeated, bewildered, worthless, completely hurt by the expierence of someone else belittling my feelings, ESPECIALLY someone who should care the most, and ignoring my suffering. In tears, i made my journey to the ER because i couldnt stand to be in that building any longer after the treatment i had received to try and contest someone who obviously had no typr of sympathy for me or consideration for my feelings.

Thank you for ruining my Easter Sunday and triggering my depression for a few days.

If you would like to receive optimal care at this location youll have better luck at the ER, where even THEIR doctors say the urgent care personel dont do anything at their location. Very sad and disappointing</review>

I knew I had strep throat and they sent me home saying no strep and I went home and continued to get even more sick. Next day I went to Kaiser emergency cause I couldn’t breath any longer  and they did a strep test and guess what I had strep. I feel like this place had lack of knowledge and lack or care for the patients. As a doctor no matter how busy you might be, if you don’t care about the well been  of another dying sick Person you shouldn’t be a doctor. Thank god for Kaiser to actually give me the help I need.< /review><Rating>1</Rating>< gmapID>

My husband had to be seen twice. Although, the staff was nice when were visiting, they didn't listen to him when he told them he is allergic to codeine and told him to take it anyamway. We have both tried calling numerous times on different days to request a new prescription and it continues to say "all agents are busy... call back at a later time." And then it hangs up on you. It doesn't let you hold or anything... what kind of medical facility does that?</review>

Staff told my husband to change the dressing on his large wound daily. They gave him some gauze and films that weren't big enough so we went through them quickly. Stopped by urgent care to see if we could get just 2 more for overnight and got turned down because they don't order enough to do that. All this money we spend on health care and we can't get 2 bandages?? Felt talked down to by the employee as well. Do not give instructions to follow and then not provide enough bandages (ones that's aren't even available outside of the medical field, mind you)!<//review>

<Name>Bruce Marquez< /Name><Review>I went to urgent care for an injured hand.  Service was super quick, in and out of X-ray twice in a matter of minutes.  I ended up needing surgery for  broken fingers.  I was billed by the orthopedic surgeon for surgery and for surgery at urgent care. My insurance was going to pay 80% of both charges without question since different codes were used in the billing.  I disputed the urgent care surgery charge and it was reversed, changed back to an office visit.  Don't buy the "nonprofit" response. The care I received was excellent, but expect astronomical charges for every little thing and dispute suspect charges.<//Review>< Rating>

Everyone who works here just seems pissed off including reception and the doctors. The doctor talked down to me and was very condescending, all I had was a few honest questions and she talked to me like I was an idiot hypochondriac, despite the fact I had waited 3 days with symptoms before going. Very rude and unnecessary. Wait time was about 45 min which is pretty good for urgent care which is why I give it 2 stars. Everyone hates urgent care one way they could make it a better experience is by at least offering compassionate service.< /Text>

We saw Wilmajoan DeGraff-Olsen and she was thorough. Highly recommend 😷.  Antibiotics were needed, called in and picked up on the way home. Sometimes you wait a bit longer as though who come in after you may require help immediately.

I could not get through when calling.  My diagnosis was sketchy as the MD did not have my test that was taken by a PA prior to him entering the office.  I will say that the doctor was pleasant and a good listener. PA was great and everyone was cordial.  I had a reaction to meds & could only contact them via email.  The meds were changed 20 minutes before the pharmacy closed...not a pleasant experience.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I was seen on 10/27 for acute sinusitis. Was given a prescription for generic Augmentin. Explained to the Dr. that I was scheduled for surgery on 10/30. He said not a problem, at least you will have taken this for 3 days.  2 days taking it and the tinnitus was so loud in my ears, I couldn't sleep.  Tried calling the urgent care for over 1/2 hr, then tried later. Always got the same recording, call back later. No matter what selection you  make, you get the same msg.  Never got thru. After my surgery, the infection began bothering me again, tried calling for over an hour to get thru, same msg, call back later. Called Safeway pharmacy, told them what was happening, they said they would try calling them.  An hour went by, they called me and apologized, they were getting the same answer.  Even Urgent Care Med  7 calls to check up on me after I've been seen.  Had this place done that, the prescription could have been changed way before now.  Very disappointed.</Review>

<review>First time coming here. After waiting in a room for about 45 min to see a doctor an assistant came in and asked my name. After she closed the door 5 min later she is back to say another doctor will see me and roomed me into a different room saying there was a patient ahead of me. It's been 25 min and no one has checked up on me. They forgot I was originally roomed. I should've gone to Alhambra urgent care.< /review><Date>1497054203009<//Date>< Rating>

Don't go here!  I recently made a visit for an infection I had developed. There were about 8 peole in the waiting room that could hold about 20 people. It wasn't busy, but it took over an hour before the one staff person could take my information. When she called me up to start filling paper work she couldn't give an estimate for how long before I would be seen. I asked the people next to me how long they had been waiting. They said more than two hours. There were security guards roving in and out every 15 minutes. Scary place!

I left and went over to the Urgent Care on Douglas Blvd. They took my information right away. I was in and out with a prescription of antibiotics in 35 minutes.< /text>

Arrived here after being told by the Sutter Walk In clinic that my insurance doesn't cover the walk in clinic, and I'd have to go to the urgent care. Arrived at urgent care 30 minutes before they opened and was called to reception 15 minutes after opening, only to be told they couldn't accept me at urgent care either. After stating that I was told to come here from the Sutter Walk In clinic, I was told "Sorry sir, you should know your insurance." Snarky attitude by the receptionist. Thanks Sutter Health!< /text>

<review>Complete waste of time if you have more than a cold. You will sit in their waiting area for 2hours just to be told that "we cant handle that here". Then expect to go to the emrgency waiting room for 4 hours Just for an antibiotic And asprin. Save yourself a lot of bullshit and go to emegency early.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>no one answers the phone phone systems designed to cut back on employees. I needed to ask questions before i came in and verify they take my insurance. Laura you are not saying anything of substance in your responses to bad reviews talk is cheap</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1504297407702, 'text': 'Hi, Wil.  Our Urgent Care Centers serve as priority facilities for those facing immediate medical needs. The Roseville Urgent Care Center doesn’t make appointments, provide any phone advice or have insurance specialists on-site. For your coverage questions, it’s likely best to call your insurance provider directly (number is usually on the back of your wallet card) to determine if they’ll cover a visit with us.  As a second option, you could call our billing department at (866) 681-0736 to see if we accept your policy. However, ultimately your insurance company decides what is covered.  Should you need urgent care in Roseville, please do drop in. We post our approximate wait times at http://bit.ly/2wqvRBD. For less urgent needs, consider Sutter Roseville Walk-In Care. They take drop-ins and also make appointments, their website is https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-location/facility/roseville-walk-in-care.  If you have additional questions, email me directly at Social@SutterHealth.org. I’ll be sure we get you some answers.  Best of health, Laura'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Great food in a pleasant place.  Our server was very courteous.  I was also a big fan of the refried beans they served along with the traditional salsa and chips.

The food cost about $5 more than I usually pay at similar restaurants, but that wouldn't be enough to keep me from going back.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I order 2 cheese enchiladas and a
tamale. The sause that they had was very dreadful. I wasn't very satisfied with the food at all. I had bad cheese enchiladas from other restaurants. This might be the worst enchilada I ever had. If you look at the picture of the tamale sauce it does not look appetizing at all. Service were really friendly though.< /Review>< pics>

<Name>morgan Taylor< /Name><Review>Delicous. Husband gave up meat for lent and I'm a vegetarian so we ordered fajita taco salads with just beans. The waiter was nice enough to ask the cooks to add on the carmalized fajita veggies and not charge us for regular fajita salads since the expense is for meat we're not eating. The food was exceptionally good. Their house salsa was the best Ive had and the decorations in the restaurant are lovely. If I lived in redding I'd come often.< /Review><time>1615078645524<//time><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

Comically bad Mexican food. Elementary school-cafeteria quality. Cheap ingredients. Their burritos look like something a 5 year old would construct during “cooking with mom” night. Bland. Cheap greasy cheese. We literally laughed the entire to-go meal about how bad everything is....this IS your one-stop shop for your worst Mexican food experience. So bad.< /review>

Authentic Mexican food.  They serve you chips and salsa with refried beans.  And they have the best blended margaritas ! Large proportions.  Tasty food.

<Text>They serve generous portions, but it is worth it to indulge!  Sharing the combo steak and chicken fajitas is enough for two. Chile relleno, delicious. Don't forget the margaritas served, again, generously in an extra large glass.</Text>< pics>

When we showed up they were very busy and we still didn't have to wait long to be seated. The service was wonderful and the food was great! The margaritas are huge and come with a follow up tequila shot! My first time dining there and definitely not my last👍< /Text>

I had originally written a great review but, am now updating because, I started experiencing very bad stomach cramping and diarrhea. My son is experiencing the same symptoms as well. We had dinner there last night and are still sick today. Will never eat here again and definitely do not recommend<//Text>

<review>I was kind of blown away tonight. Arrived after closing. My boyfriend and I stayed in the parking lot to search for another restaurant when one of the staff came out. They said that they were closed, but they had a table that hadn't received their meal yet and invited us in. Let's just say....service, food, atmosphere, you name it, TOP NOTCH!!!! Cannot describe just how delighted we were! Thank you, and we will definitely make this a regular spot!😊😊😊</review>< Rate>

It was a real joy to spend Bryce's 21st birthday which was October 2nd,, The crew took great care of everyone in Bryce's party. They even supplied some extra birthday slammers for everyone..
a wonderful place to go and have chips and salsa with your family and friends !!!
Many Thanks !</review>

Service was good, ambience was good. Food left a lot to be desired. Ordered steak fajitas, steak was over cooked and tuff. Tacos were blah, chips and dip were so-so.</review>

<text>Okay, this place was just Awesome!! The food is delicious!! The service was fantastic!! It made the night out with the family just a great time!! It seemed we were catered to. Didnt really have to ask for anything or if we did it was quickly responded to. It can seem to be a tad expensive, but so worth the price for the service along with great food!! I highly recommend giving them a try!!<//text><userid>114685501192988555641</userid><pictures>None< /pictures>< Date>

Excellent Mexican Restaurant.  The servers are attentive. The chips and salsa were tasty but not plentiful. They also give you a bean dip along with the salsa which was a nice touch.  We had tacos which were excellent.<//Text>

Got a combination plate to go. They don't bother to separate the taco from the rest of the items so you get a soggy taco that you can't pick up and eat.< /Text>

The food was at a great price. 4 adults 2 kids for birthday dinner was just about 60.00.. amazing. Food tasted good a little better than the medium.. not great!! Tasting but far from bad. It was clean most eveyone was friendly.  Aver all wish i could give more stars but... we had the worst server. Others helped us and asked their tabkes ifthey wanted more to drink etc, but nit ours he hid out most of the time. We were a party of 15 ppl and we were ALL done and bored before we could pay and it took me getting up goin over and waiting and waiting before i could ask if we would get checks soon cuz wed really like to go home tonight. Eeerrr. So other than him good good good<//Review>

Went there to eat an hour before an event we were going to (across the street from restaurant), wasn't crowded so we thought we would be ok. We thought wrong. Drinks came in an ok amount of time, food took just over 30 minutes. After the food came we realized we didn't have silverware, that took another 5 minutes to get. In the almost hour we were there no one offered to refill our drinks.</Review>

We go almost every Sunday after church with the our kids and have some awesome food and enjoy having Bryan waiting on us. He is so professional and fast on service. We recommend the beef  enchilada plate and camarones mexicanos. The kids get nice portions and have tried almost every meal on the kids menu. Also kids menu items are 99cents on sundays. You also get chips, salsa, and refried beans with tasty white cheese for an appetizer and end the meal with a sweet desert. We got churos and vanilla ice cream last time we went. Go see Bryan and the gang and have a great meal on sundays.< /Text>

Went with a large group and there were two other large groups already. We were accommodated immediately and service was great and quick. The servers teamed up on each table serving everyone quickly. The food came out faster than expected and it was all good. Not one of us had a single error or issue.</Text>

I really enjoy this place. Food is great, it's clean & the employees are friendly & fun. The main reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because they do not have beer on tap. Most good mexican food restaurants have a nice selection of beers on tap🍺🍻</text>

Food was way pricier than the take out I usually get and not nearly as good. Food was not warm after being wrapped in a foil container. Very disappointing. I will stick to take out at Chipotle< /review>

What a lovely burrito! Carnitas, lots of lean tasty pork carnitas wrapped in a flour tortilla with the works over the top, sprinkled with cheese and smothered in a delicious salsa. Delicious, I'll be back.</Text>

Great food and service. If you need a nice, quiet place to take your sweetie, this isn't it. The joint is Jumpin and people are having fun.<//text>

You get chips, salsa and bean dip to start! Portions are good enough to stuff a young man and you get a fried tortilla with whip cream and strawberry sauce after your meal.  Good food with friendly staff. My favorite stop on my way home!<//review>

Very torn on how to rate this. The place is not clean. It's in such great need of a thorough cleaning. The bathroom floors were so sticky I almost stuck to them. The food was ok. The avocado they put on my tacos was old and looked not good. The carne asada mean was good though.< /text>

The food was great, I had the large combination plate #29 a chimichanga and an enchilada. We got chips and salsa and even a side of beans and cheese with our chips. The atmosphere was festive and the tequila was flowing . It was a little loud for my taste, but that is a matter of personal preference. I will go back.</Review>

Nice Mexican Restaurant.  The best I have tried in Redding. I had the chili relleno and taco. I thought both were delicious.  My husband had the carne asada burrito and did not enjoy his meal as much.  The waitress was very efficient and friendly.  The atmosphere was kind of dark so I couldn't judge the cleanliness.<//Text>

Pretty good for Redding Mex, but Mexican food in this area is mediocre at best.< /text>

I 💘 the beans you get with chips and salsa.

< Review>
I've been going here for 20+ years and I have been absolutely pleased Every Time.
The service is impeccable, they are: Friendly, Courteous, Prompt and Eager to Please.
The food is always: Fresh, Hot and Tasty.
They have all the Mexican food classics. Children are welcome. They love to host a birthday dinner for any age. Their drinks are also excellent.
The Camarones Mexicanos are so good I have a hard time ordering anything else, and a Tequila Popper always goes well with the bill.
This is always the first restaurant in Redding that I recommend.< /Review>

<Text>One of my favorite places usually but my go to meal was different, too many onions cutting back on meat and my husband got the end of the avacodo steam in his food and hurt his tooth and it looked like his tooth when he took it out. Thankfully it wasnt and accidents do happen but this wasnt the first time that we had something in our food that didnt belong</Text>< UserId.>

Meh, it's ok, but pretty much identical to about 10 other Mexican places in Redding, not really anything special.< /Text>

It's kind of pricey for the quality of food. The servers are friendly and fast and the refried beans are homemade.<//review>

In a word: FANTASTIC! From initial contact, through scheduling and pick up, Junk King shined. The website was straightforward and easy to navigate, Bill the rep was intelligible and helpful, and the actual movers, Gio and Gerry were great. In, Out. Done. Oh, and out of 9 companies I called, their price was right. I highly recommend Junk King!

The guys called 20 minutes ahead of time to notify me of their arrival, once they arrived they saw the furniture I wanted removed and gave me a reasonable quote. They did the job swiftly and quickly and it feels so great to be rid of old bulky furniture! Would recommend.</Text>

BEWARE OF PRICE HIKES & DAMAGE

I was quoted a maximum of $620 (based on load size of a full truck) on the phone. Then when they got here I was made aware of additional fees that we're not discussed on the initial call. No way my stuff took up a full truck. Not even close. Was quoted $800 on the spot. Happy my stuff is gone. Not happy I had to pay way more than expected and the quote was way over what it actually took in their truck load.

Also beware of damage. In moving out two bed frames, they took 4 huge paint scuffs out of the wall down to the drywall.<//review>

<text>Loved loved loved their service. They called when they were on their way. They arrived on time. They had good customer service. With the amount I had, I didn't think they'd get rid of it so fast. I'm so happy with their service. I will use them in the future if needed. Thanks for helping me get rid of the junk so that I can start to upgrade my house!<//text>< username>

<Text>The men were nice and I have no complaints about their work BUT they came an hour earlier than scheduled. Good thing I was home. The scheduled time was between 1-3 pm, they came at noon.
Also, check for price first, they are pricey!< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I don’t normally write reviews. But I have to write  one about this company.  I used Junk King this morning and they were amazing.

I had a ton of junk

Hard-core trash that had to go to the dump, recycling, and some nice furniture and books they send for donation where appropriate.

They hauled it all away In a few hours. They were friendly and professional.

Seriously impressed!< /Text>< resp>

<Text>I am very disappointed with this service. I only had one treadmill to remove. The workers thought they were capable of moving it by hand without any equipments - no dolly or blankets. As a result they dinted my door, scratched my furniture, and scuffed my wall. No apologies or anything just “oh you can wipe it off with water”. Well, FYI it didn’t work. They were however very quick to collect their money and leave. My treadmill was removed but I would not trust this company again.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

Got rid of my extra “stuff.” Some call it “junk” I just call it “stuff.” Junk can have such a negative connotation. I obviously felt like I needed this “stuff” at some point for some reason. But when I was ready to “purge,” Junk King was here to help. Isn’t that how life should be? When we are ready to “receive,” the Universe will “provide.” 🙏 ~Namaste to my peeps at Junk/Stuff Kings<//text>

It’s rare to find Pork Chow Mein with crispy noodles anymore so I order the noodles separately. Then I buy a package of crispy noodles at the market to mix my Chow Mein.  It just fits my childhood memories that way. Now everything else on the menu is just perfect. I especially love the sizzling sea food dish. The servings are plenty for dinner and lunch the next day.< /text>

This place is great place to eat without a doubt!! Took my girlfriend's daughter for the first time. But this time we had to wait for a good long time for the food. I could tell they were short handed in the kitchen. One thing I hate is going and ask for a refill. Still this place we love it.<//review>

We were driving for hours and needed a place to stop and eat something. Based on the reviews, Chow's kitchen in Kingsburg was the place to go. My bf had wor won ton soup and I had a chicken chow mein. The portions were big and the food was so good. The only downfall if you wanted to order a combo item is that they all have some sort of pork in it. If you don't eat pork then your only option is to pick a non-combo item. They had great service, and the restaurant was nice and clean inside. I definitely would recommend anyone to try it! Chow's kitchen was delicious. Thanks so much!!!!</Text>

Just left this restaurant with my entire family in digust. We ordered and after 1 hour all we had was water!!!! They were literally bringing out 1 plate at a time to a party of 4. Absolutely ridiculous! Never coming back again!!! Horrible service.<//Text>

<Review>What a great dinner we had here. There were 4 of us and we went to dinner around 6 PM on Sunday. It was nice and quite, not busy at all. The waitress was nice and wasn't too bothersome, she checked on us just the right number of times. Didn't interrupt our conversation and kept the drinks filled. The food was awesome. We had 2 orders of orange chicken, 1 egg foo young, and 1 teriyaki chicken combo. The combos are great as they come with chow mein and pork fried rice. My favorite is the teriyaki chicken and my wife really likes the egg foo young. Everyone was very happy with their orders. Haven't had a bad meal here yet. On occasion if its busy it can get a little loud in here, the sound really bounces around the dining area there.</Review>< gmapID>

Haven't been here in awhile since they changed owners, but service is still great, fast and friendly, the only thing I noticed was that the food didn't taste the same I found it to be more dry and bland, but besides that they give u good portion for the price, it's not to expensive.overall it's a good place.<//review>

<Text>Ordered online: Thai Basil Cashew Chicken-no red chili’s, Crispy Honey Chicken, and Lettuce Wraps. I think I got garlic chicken instead of Thai basil Cashew chicken because there was no basil there were no cahsews, no basil, no red peppers, only onions. The crispy honey chicken was super dry and the chicken fir the lettuce weaps was mostly mushrooms (which I really don’t care for but tolerate as an ingredient) and barely any chicken whatsoever. I called and Socorro apologized and offered to remake but it was after 7pm and we were busy packing to move so did not have time for that. I was told unable to get refund since ordered online whick inadvertently took me to Grubhub Or she can offer a giftcard credit for a free entree . In the situation I should have gotten a gift card for three entrees because the food we got was poor quality and some not even what I ordered. Major disappointment for Pickup Stix which is usually a favorite. As a matter of fact, I just ordered $200 worth of individual entrees and a few fily last month from Aliso Viejo for a party and everything was awesome. So glad I didn’t order from this location!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>No fault of the front.  Sorry cooks, food quality and it being over seasoned topping with the freshness being completely gone.
I ordered the lettuce wrap. I felt like there was a lot too much dark sauce,way too much! The chicken was overcooked, chewy, not much else great to say that was appealing with the chicken. Definitely not tasteful! The lettuce itself when you turned it over was brown, old. They were hiding the fact that the lettuce with browning. The carrots were dry and sat out far too long and
Zero flavor! Definitely out of a bag carrots. The bean sprouts were the best part of the entire meal.

Don't see myself visiting this place much if the quality of the food is this bad, it is totally been deteriorating.< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Asian dishes with a California flavor.
We eat at Stix a lot, and really like it. Try the House fried rice, very good. Lots of shrimp and beef. We also like the House chicken with seasonal vegetables.
Try the family dinner. It will be enough for three people, four if you're not big eaters.
We didn't care for the General's chicken. Maybe we got it on a bad day, we'll try it again. It was overcooked and there was no sauce or vegetables with it. It's the only I've got at Stix that was disappointing.
Don't hesitate to try Stix if you haven't been. We like it a lot!</text><Response>{'time': 1623965556835, 'text': 'Thank you for the great rating and fantastic feedback, Timothy!

I really like this Pick Up Stix. This place is close to my home and my wife loves their food. We get the house special chicken or the beef and broccoli. I like that they make your order fresh right when you order it. The food is always hot and very good. The employees are friendly and very helpful, if you need anything, they are always willing to help you out. I would highly recommend this Pick Up Stix.</review>

<Text>ordered grub hub from pick up stix at this location but they delivered the wrong food.  the manager said if i brought it back he would refund my order to me and give me the food i ordered.  i brought it back but the manager never refunded me.  1 star for a lying manager and bad customer service.  who the hell wants to drive food back when you ordered from grub hub in the first place????? try your local asian eateries.  this asian place is trash< /Text></record>

<text>Last night, I went to pick up stix. I ordered the healthiest food in the menu which was beef broccoli. I went out and sat on the patio, the tables were sticky and nasty. The meat was like rubber in my mouth. The food was too salty and sweet. After I got home, I got stomach ache. Employees were nice and friendly. I strongly recommend to stay away from that place and tell your friends!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Never been to one of these restaurants before.  Not quites fest enough to be called fast food and a bit more expensive.  However, a very good value when considering superior food quality, fresh ingredients cooked to order.  I really like this place and will seek out other locations after finally giving them a shot.</review>

Greasy, salty and sugary food. Therefore taste good, because it’s bad for you. Looks good, but not really good. Stay away from this place if you care about your health.<//Text>

I'm a permanent customer of this place, the food quality dropped dramatically in the last the 2 year the price went up &  the quality dropped. Because of the laziness of employees they replaced the beef with Mongolian beef and I was embarrassed to change my food. The food was so salty and the employees were rude!<//text>

<gmap_id>0x80dcec14a1e04187:0xe7aad263b0242581< /gmap_id><review>Updated: They must be cutting corners, because I swear their chicken tasted-like and even had the texture of calamari. Even after reordering and making my complaint known, they still could not get it right. I mean, it's chicken. I won't be going back for some time. Wasted my money on poor quality, just awful, terrible food.

< review>
We rarely eat here, but when we do the staff is always so friendly!!!  They are helpful and polite and with kids with allergies, they are attentive to the food prep.  The food is ok but the nice managers and staff make it a place we would come back to.</review>

When we moved into this place our apartment wasn't ready. There were no doors on the cabinets or the bathroom. The place was infested with roaches. They had an exterminator come out and we still had to fumigate the apartment ourselves to get rid of the problem. If you're looking for great places to eat good luck. This place is right in the middle of a food desert. Save your money and go elsewhere. The rent is too high for subpar living conditions.< /review>

Awesome job repairing our front door lock!!

We recently moved into a one bedroom one bath apartment and found out our keys did not work with ease. I submitted the request at their earliest available time slot and they showed up on time, we’re professional, and were extremely quick (within 5 mins). Awesome experience so far as a new resident<//Review>

Greetings ,

I’d want to share my experiences living at LakeView Village Apartment Homes. In an effort to inform prospective renters & residents about what the living experience is . From the moment I meet the staff and viewed & toured the property I knew I desired to live here. I love the spacious floor plans , pet friendly community and amenities. My experiences have been positive with the property manager , staff and service maintenance.
Mr. Tony Gonzalez is professional , prompt and courteous. He always greets you with a smile and immediately responds to maintenance requests. The property is kept clean by a courtesy staff too. LakeView Village Apartment Homes is a beautiful and well kept property. I love the neighborhood of Ranch San Diego too! Come see for yourself all that our LakeView Village Apartments Homes have to to offer. Schedule a tour today!</review>

The staff was always friendly and helpful. Maintenance was does expeditiously. Parking was abundant, except when they did asphalt repairs. The major complaint I have is that the walls are a bit thin. I lived on the bottom floor, and at times the upstairs neighbors were pretty loud. And you could hear some neighbors yelling at each other at 2 in the morning. Other than that the community is great to live in.< /text>

Rosie really helped me out with my move following my deployment. My deployment return date changed several times and they were very accommodating with all my requests. I returned on a federal holiday and they even allowed me to have my fiancé pick up my keys and drop off some important paperwork. It really took some of the stress off of me knowing i had a place to come home to when i pulled in. Thank you for everything.< /review>

Overall it's an ok place to live. My husband and I have been living here for almost a year, we are moving out because of the price hike. Pros: it's a quiet place overall, but you can hear the highschool from time to time. It has washer and dryer within the unit. I have not had any issues with staff or management, they were always courteous and friendly. There are military families here my husband being one and it's not too far from 32 at base. Shopping centers are close by. Also Amazon hub within the community it's a plus
Cons: too many spiders outside and inside. At one point we killed about 6-7 in a week in the apartment. Water bill is shared within the unit so even if we conserve Water bill is still high. Make sure you read your lease, most apartment is a 30 day notice this is 60 days so even though our lease ends this month we still have to pay next months rent since we thought it was a 30 day notice ( not really a con or pro more like be aware).</Text>

The apartments are "renovated" this means they painted the insides of the cabinet and drawers with cheap dark brown paint and put new pulls on them. There are many "parked" cars that never move. The rent is to high for this dump. You are paying the water bill for the whole complex, this includes the sprinkler system.< /review>

When viewing the apartment we were blown away by the beautiful landscaping and upgrades. But soon after you move in you start to notice all of the things wrong with this complex. You’re so distracted by the new appliances that you don’t notice the things wrong when you move in. The windows are so old and not efficient so in the summer if you run the AC be prepared for a $300 electric bill. They say you have AC but both summers of living there we had problems. The office staff is wonderful to you until you actually move in and start paying rent, all you are to them is a check. They are awful, and they do not care if you’re having problems with the unit or neighbors. You pay your deposit when you move in, but you’re still more than likely going to pay a couple hundred dollars at move out for carpet that is 5 years old, and paint defects that were already there when you moved in. If you have any problems and try to call the office, that is IF you actually get to talk to someone instead of an answering machine, the person you usually talk to (Rosie) acts like you’re inconveniencing her and talks to you like you’re inadequate. We thought our apartment was decent, but due to all the other inconveniences we would not recommend this place.<//Text>

Cons:
1. DO NOT RENT HERE IF YOU HAVE A MOTORCYCLE. unless you have a unit with a garage it will get stolen. Bikes get stolen from here all the time, multiple bikes at once.

2. Don't get a unit with a stackable washer/dryer. They are old and take at least two cycles for your clothes to dry which equals more electricity used.

3. I'm not sure if the unit above me was empty when I first moved in or if my new neighbors were just loud but I could hear everything. Arguments are understandable because of yelling, but I shouldn't be able to hear you discussing the TV show you're watching.

Pros:
1. Ms Beverly in the office is very friendly and helpful.

2. My unit was very spacious with a nice large back patio.

3. Rented for a year and the only maintenance related issue I had was a dead light bulb at the front door. I put a request in online and it was fixed the next day.

4. Close to anything you need; groceries, food, movie theater, hookah ect.<//Review>

<Text>These people have no consideration for your privacy, we have told them many times that our apt is a no entry property but they enter as they please. Also, they are all about business, they dont care about your schedule, they will have people come at a half a days notice without thinking about the fact that everyone has their own schedule and will walk in and out your place like it's theirs. Were not renewing our lease these are not people you want to deal with. It is definitely not a place for families. You will regret it!!!</Text>< Pics>

When you have to look for a new home online instead of in person with no way of looking at the apartments ahead of time (military move), they make the pictures look real nice.
After two long days of driving, we arrive at our new home, receiving a not so warm welcome from the leasing agent talking on her personal cell phone at her desk, not making any eye contact with us or even greeting us when we arrived. After sitting and waiting for almost 10 minutes for her to be done with her phone call, we were greeted with, "can I help you?" It was not the 'welcome to your new home' anyone should be greeted with when tenants are paying over $2000 in rent and utilities for cheaply renovated apartments. They also charge you for everyone else's water bill after they divide it between tenants, so if you aren't here half the month, you will still get a bill.
If we knew that we wouldn't have any other option for internet besides AT&T, we may have looked elsewhere as well.
I give these apartments 2 stars because they were easily accessible and allowed us to pay a deposit to hold a unit for us, which was really convenient. They also allow pets.< /review>

<rate>2<//rate><text>We lived in this complex for just over a year and it was decent. Quite area, and for being on the border of Spring Valley, Ranch San Diego, and La Mesa shopping is convenient. I was initially very hesitant to rent here because of the terrible reviews on Google and Yelp ( I've seen they have improved since then) but my husband (military) knew a few other military families that lived in the complex so we went to check it out. Also it was the closest to our price range that we were going to find in San diego. We also liked that the deposit wasn't as much as the rent which is what you tend to find here. The staff was nice enough, but the office always smells like really strong perfume, it's almost obnoxious. Anyways, they got us in with a promotional lower rent deal, I guess and put us on an 8 month lease, of course after this time period they raised the rent by $200 for another year lease and it's even more if you want to do a 6 month of a month to month lease (side note they don't normally offer 8 month leases).

The complex has a lot of military families that commute to work it's about a 20 minute drive to Coronado island without traffic. However, morning traffic hits at around 6-630am so if you are commuting during this time expect a 45+ minute commute. My husband often had to leave around 430-5am to make it to work before traffic would hit or he would not make it on time. However, living next to the 94 E freeway was convenient going west will take you straight into downtown. Another small pro we liked is the extra background checks they do, while it is more expensive then the normal $50 checks, there is a high school across the street (yes you can hear all the games and bells) and an elementary school not too far either, it made me personally feel it would be a safer community with the extra background investigation.

Now to the CONS:

MILITARY FAMILIES PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU GIVE "PROPER NOTICE" they will let you out of your lease if you are PCSing on orders, but notice must be given on the 1st even if it is a weekend.... as a nurse i worked weekends 12 hour shifts, so I figured I could go in the following Monday since there is a 3 day grace period for rent and give notice and pay my rent at the same time. THIS IS NOT THE CASE, we tried giving notice on the 3rd and they proceeded to charge us the whole next month of rent, since we did not let them know on the 1st. I have never heard such a ridiculous thing, the staff/manager could barely explain it and are not willing to make any exceptions or work with the you. We were also not planning to leave the next month until the 4th or 5th so it was still technically considered a 30 day notice, but they still would do nothing. So make sure you actually take the time to ready over every page and paragraph of your lease other wise they WILL take advantage, simply put if they can gouge money out of you, they will.

Another con which is common in other reviews is the issue with utilities, plain and simple they are expensive we never paid less the $150 per month not including electric. The water is split between all the residents in the complex so it doesn't matter if you try to conserve water or not. It honestly wouldnt be that bad if they didn't love to water the sidewalks so much. I've seen the sprinklers come on even after it had been raining.

The only internet provider is AT&T, they weren't terrible but it would be nice to have better options, cell phone service is pretty terrible calls will constantly be dropped.

Their gym is a waste of space, apparently they are planning on building a new one where the tennis courts are but they haven't started that and this was told to us over a year ago. They tell you to use at your own risk lol and this truly is the case, their machines are rusted and worn. Don't  use the treadmills if your shoes dont have the greatest grip because the belts are worn completely flat and are slick. They even have one of the eliptical held together with tape.

While living there we encounter problems with Rats, Roaches, and flies.

<Text>I liked the apartment but not the management or location. When we moved in about a year ago, the apartment was full of flees. You could see them jumping from the carpet onto my husband and I cause they hadn't eaten in probably days. So obviously the place was not cleaned beforehand. We had to clean the place ourselves. You also split the water bill with the other tenants based on apparently the number of people in your house hold, which I didn't really believe because we were out of town for 3 weeks but still got charged the same amount we got when we were home for the whole month.. and they explained this by saying maybe the other tenants had family over, and used more water etc.. Hmph. My husband's car also got broken into.. twice. They apparently have security at night but I dont think that's the case. Neighbors said our car was alarming but yet security said they didn't notice a thing. They didn't notice a car missing all wheels, window broken and jacked up. Ok. We only lived here for a year.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>If I can give this a zero rating I would. We've been staying here for 8 months, and I'm glad that were moving out soon. Neighbors are loud even when its 3am in the morning, playing loud music or video games! Plus Customer service here is awful. Just ealier I went to the office and asked nicely about my packages. I came to the office and see if they could help me because I received an email that says its been delivered but it wasnt there. I was talking to the lady in the front desk and while i was talking to her, I could feel that she was irritated. She keep telling me "I dont know". Like wth? Is that the best thing you can do? I think she should at least tell me "sorry for the inconvenience, I would speak to our manager and let them know about the situation" etc and maybe she could contact me or something. I even told her theres a camera inside where we pick up our packages and she straight up said "No theres no camera there!". Okay???? Then why is there a big black circle thing that looks like a camera infront of where you punch in the codes? Kinda like an atm camera. And I wasnt even done talking to her, and she gave me a big sigh, stand up and walk out somewhere.. Its not the first time i talked to her, and believe me she needs to re-learn how to properly give a better customer service, she can't even smile!  Im so glad were leaving!!!< /text>< pictures>

Allows pets but its like 50$ extra a month for one cat. Some of the apartments are updated to white cabinets, which you will pay extra for. Parking is always great, never have issues, you get one covered spot with your apt but there is plenty of parking for a second car. Gym is eh. The cable doesnt work half the time and when I asked if they could reset the router/modem they replied "I dont know how deal with that". Also in the gym there are missing pin things for the weights so only one person can use it at a time. Plus someone broke in to the gym which makes me think this area isnt as safe as I thought.   The walls are thick enough to not hear your neighbors but the windows are the worst. It sounds like they are wide open when closed. The water bill is split between four apartments. so say you will be gone for a month, you will still be paying a 90 $ bill. The lady in the office knows nothing and is useless.  I wouldnt recommend this place.<//Review>

The ONLY reason to live here is because it one of the few pet friendly places in SD. However, they charge pet rent on top of a hefty deposit so not so good. The appartments themselves are blah at best. Shotty old cabinets through out (in every appartment). Water damage that, and i quote, "we arent going to fix that because we dont want to replace only your cabinets and leave every body else out".. The paint is second rate at best. Cant touch it wihtout staining/marking it. The flooring is ok, except for the carpeting not having been pressed down or tucked under the baseboards. There is water damage on the celieng that they "wont be fixing anytime soon". The patio is ok except the posts are rotting away at the base. They charge a rediculous amount of money to live here and then slam all of the other fees on top of that. For what it costs its not worth it. I had to fix all the doors so they would latch, as well as the stove and fridge so they would close properly. I only had to give in because time wasnt on my side and i have pets which limits me to about 20-25% of the properties in SD. On top of all that, the costomer service in general is crap. Within 30 days of living here i was threatened with lawsuits over a mistake on their part. I would give less stars but the people who live here are pretty cool and there are lots of pets.</Text>

You’ll find a few Karen’s complaining but it’s a fast food chain for Pete’s sake. Lower those expectations my guys. There’s a few other food spots around but you can get in and out quick here. It’s hit or miss with specific entrees you want sometimes but there’s plenty of options. I like when people complain and make a scene for the entree instead of the other 20 things you can get. I will say the chow Mein has lost its touch. Kinda doesn’t have any flavor whatsoever.<//Review>

<Text>This is the best panda express in the area. It's new, clean, and usually not too busy. It's easy enough to order food right now during quarantine. Enough people go here that the food is usually nice and fresh. I've rarely gotten food that I felt was sitting for too long. Definitely recommend this location!<//Text><userid>113464212142972927286< /userid>< Resp>

<Pics>None<//Pics><rating>1</rating><text>WRITING IN REAL TIME: I came here for lunch today to claim my coupon with T-Mobile Tuesday’s. I followed the instructions and it was still valid for today. I ordered online, as per instructions, and I even paid already so I expected to have no problems.

I came and the first thing that the cashier and manager said to me is that the coupon was NOT valid although there was another customer waiting to claim the exact same coupon. I expected my order to be ready by the time I indicated and the coupon did NOT have any problems online.

I will update as soon as I get my order. This was a VERY disappointing first experience ordering here!

Update: I received my order, and it was sitting on the counter for about 10 minutes because the egg rolls were NOT done. I had to go back to work, so I asked if I could just have two veggie rolls instead. My personal feedback would be that this location really needs to step up on the online ordering and streamline it so people, who are on their lunch break, do NOT waste any time.

The cuisine of Panda finally comes to Rockridge! I won’t deny it, when the mood is there I like this place. It may not be authentic Chinese food for some, but darn it it’s authentic American Chinese food. Besides calling beef stir fry Chinese food is like calling pasta European food.<//text>

The first few times I went to this place they would give me ~1.5-2 scoops of orange chicken in my panda bowl. In perspective, this equates to about  a 1.5 thick layer of chicken in the bowl. In my recent visit, however, the lady gave me barely 1 scoop of orange chicken. The small amount of chicken was evident when looking at the bowl; there were no pieces of chicken stacked on top of each other and patches of chow mein could be seen through the orange chicken "layer".  When I enquired about getting more chicken she said "its only 1 scoop", and only added a single piece of chicken. The portion was truly pitiful. At this point I knew it was not worth my time or effort to argue, so I just paid and left. Also I didn't notice until after that I was only given one fortune cookie. This is a problem because, one,  I had paid for two panda bowls and, two, I was there with a friend who was also clearly in line with me.

tldr, they are stingy with the orange chicken and forget to give you fortune cookies.</text>

<Review>Worst service ever!!! The fact that when we walked in no fried rice, no chow ming and about 8 other food trays empty. So I had to wait 10 mins for orange chicken and beef and broccoli. But to really top it off they had some rated R movie with Nicholas Cage banging a girl in bed and getting a BJ on the TV. Failure in all levels.  Oh and we didn't get our fortune cookies. My advice don't go to this Panda Express go to the one on 40th street by the Subway and Little Cesar< /Review>< gmap_id>

No fortune cookie included.. Service was ok, but I have come to expect the little pick me up the fortune cookie provides with my Panda meal. This is disappointing, and in my experience it's only left out at this location.</review>

No need to say about quality hamburger with all fresh ingredients and french fries made from scratch. Although still operating under Covid19 guidelines (March 2021 now) service is done at high efficiency. 2 people wait in the driveway to take your orders before approaching the cashier to pay and to pick up your orders. The line moved rapidly despite the appearance of long line of cars along the driveway. Always appreciate what they do in customer service. Keep up with the good work. You guys are the best!< /text>

This was the first time I've ever had in-n-our burger and I definitely give it a 10/ 10. I love the hot peppers they have out. Their milk shakes are also super creamy and very delicious. I would definitely recommend getting their fries animal style. I love that their menu is small and that everything is likely to come out fresh, consistent and delicious.<//Text>

<Review>Best In & Out? Well all of them have high quality very respectful patience staff that deal with undeserving petty complaints and large amounts of customers from open till close. Well I went there and got a Large 3. Double Double W/cheese w/ a 2nd burger. When I got my cup I saw the large I wanted but was called XL, sorry for my lack of knowledge but I said, oh I thought that was large, ah I'm sorry I meant XL, right and they fullfilled my wish and I walked out with 2 drinks< /Review>< Pictures>

Burger was good but my cheese fries were cold. The piece of cheese was just sitting on top. Milkshake was the best part of my meal. I don't know if I would wait 30 minutes in line again though.</text>

Followed Covid restrictions. You are able to order inside or through drive thru. No eating inside, masked required. Lunch lines are very long. Food was great.</review>

< Review>
Food is always great.  Service, even under these conditions in a pandemic, was the best. When ordering, I explained to the girl that we were traveling to Florida the next day and we were bringing 2 double doubles to our son. I asked if they would give me the sauce on the Side, so as the burgers wouldn't be a soggy mess.  They did better than that, they put a kit together, bun with the meat and cheese, wrapped, all the extras nicely bagged so as when my son gets it in 36 hours he will be able to reheat and then add the sauce, tomatoes, onion and lettuce and have as close to fresh as possible. They went out of there way to help, even though they were slammed in the drive thru. In n out is absolutely the best burgers and SERVICE.< /Review>

An oasis in the desert! Outside dining available here. Better to walk in and order drive thru line is very busy. Be prepared to wait for that fresh, juicy double double!< /Review>

Cheeseburgers here are delicious, ask for chopped chilis inside the cheeseburger, you will not regret it. Always a long line, but it because it’s so good.</Text>

I stayed away in any fast food at all, but whenever I do crave (once every 3 months ) I come here. Their milkshake is a bomb! Fries and burgers are a lot tasty than any other fast foods out there. Fresh and yummy! 😋</text>

<review>Yum! As of 3pm on a Monday 2020 pre-new years, the drive thru line is overflowing into Palmdale avenue. This line is not worth the wait.

What is worth it, is parking your car in the adjacent parking lot and taking a nice stroll into the actual restaurant (wearing your mask) and being one of 5 customers. That walk is necessary for the divine burger I’m about to indulge in.

They make your double double, extra lettuce exactly the way you order it and you get out of there unscathed.

Stroll back to your car and smirk at the same people still sitting in that drive thru line. :)< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c25830e3fe343b:0xfe2240aa05517259<//Gmap_id></record>

I never had the "animal style" before and it was sooo.good! Now i understand the insane lines around the block! The cashier was so very sweet and nice. Very friendly cause the order took a little longer than usual but he was so nice and very cute! Lol, but nice in spite of that. Rare combo! Lol enjoyed my lunch very much.<//Text>

<text>The employees are good, but I ordered 2 cheese burgers, and french fries. when I received my food in a box, my french fries were over cooked, and they placed napkins on top of the fry's. By the time I noticed, I was down the street, and I was too tired from work to go back. (10:00)p.m. I paid for fry's that I did not eat, check your food box people. I still love in and out.<//text>< pics>

They make the burgers you see on the television they are so well made you can practically taste the difference between this and other fast food chains. The fries are really good as well but they aren't for everyone. The only problem I have with this is how heavily populated they can be at times.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>In-N-Out is always my first stop when I'm in California. It's fast food done right. The friendly staff is serving up fresh cut fries that taste like real potatoes. The burgers are made with fresh ingredients and stacked to perfection. Their limited menu keeps them on top of their burger game. It was a great place to grab a bite to eat .if you are not from California.its a must stop place to stop in .and grab a double double.</text><resp>None</resp>< rate>

People compare it to McDonald's, but it's so much better!!! You can see the whole kitchen. The fries are fresh cut right in front of your eyes, and they keep cutting, because they go through them really fast, so you always get a fresh batch. The burgers are thick and juicy, with fresh crispy lettuce, onions and tomatoes. Usually a pretty long line, but fast and friendly service makes up for it. I wish we had In-N-Out on the east coast<//Text>

<Name>Hovhannes Keshishian<//Name><text>We always love us some In-N-Out Burger. The fresh ingredients and all the different ways you can customize your order keeps it entertaining and fun all the time. Occasional and unintentional hiccup here and their order missing a burger, the wrong Burger having no onions with stuff like that you can't really write a bad review for and they are human, they're allowed to make a mistake. All you have to do is let them know and they'll fix it for you. We pulled over to the side and they brought out the additional items to our vehicle.< /text><Time>1594881129927<//Time><rating>5< /rating><GmapID>0x80c25830e3fe343b:0xfe2240aa05517259</GmapID>< user>

I am slightly disappointed. First of all I have never witnessed a frown on an In and Out employee until today. Your restaurants are normally chaotic but control and pleasant. I waited 15 plus minutes for hard cold 🍟. My reason for coming. My Double Double was excellent and shake hit the mark. More attention to your lobby takeout please.<//review>

We came to this spot for lunch. This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend.  Well, we were not disappointed. The crew welcomed us with a smile and we felt excellent. The food was just great. We had a great time and we will visit this place again. Highly recommended.< /text>

It is the best burger you will ever eat! I didn't have In-N-Out back home in Tennessee and boy was I missing out. It is a great place for a great burger and French fries that won't break the bank. Unlike that clown place that is so over priced. Everything is fresh and delicious. The service is very good, they are very fast, so don't worry if the line for the drive through is long it will only take a few minutes for your order. Don't forget to try it monster style.<//Text><Date>1580093930942<//Date><username>John Walker< /username>< Pics>

Always just the way you'd expect In N Out burger. That toasted bun, tasty shakes, delicious lemonade.. the fries get a bad rep but I think I'm actually a fan of my potatoes tasting like potato, get them well done and you're golden... as well as the fries. Even though I see staff come and go, they're always friendly and know what they're doing. Definitely one of the best ran fast food est. in town. Even though I'm a huge fan of Tommy's.. The charm (and taste) of In N Out, always will bring me back to wait in line behind 10 people.</text>

< Review>
Very small parking lot, recommend the drive thru for easy access to ordering food. We arrived at 11:00am, and parking was filling up fast. Noticed customers parking in the plaza next to the restaurant and walking over. Ordered the double-double animal style, cheeseburger, fries and coke. Food was hot and tasty!<//Review>

The fries are hit and miss here... 8 out of 10 times they will be served soggy.  Ordering "well done fries" results in over fried fries 10 out of 10 times besides that, the burgers are usually on point.< /Review>

< Review>
I have never in my life experienced food poisoning. Until today. I got a double double and fries. Both tasted good, not weird or tainted. And the meat was cooked. But within 30 minutes after eating I was deathly ill. I seriously felt like I was dying.

My daughter also got really bad shooting pains in her stomach much like mine. I’m glad I got the worst of it because she seems better now. Me, not so much.</Review>

<Text>I've been throughout many In-N-Out's in California. This specific In-N-Out in Palmdale are the best. The burgers are packed!!! Unlike other In-N-Out's in Los Angeles that give you one sheet of lettuce and the thinnest tomato slice they could cut.< /Text>< Pictures>

The food came out well cooked, the service was friendly, and the patrons quiet. 9/10 would eat again. Burgers a bit expensive for me tho<//Text>

Ok I have to say my very first time ever going to In-n-Out burger and like damn highly recommended to all patrons/customers or visitors johan was the cashier I ordered from and in itself I give him 10 stars there is no comparison to any other burger joint in the United States that I’ve ever been too</text>

<review>Really great burgers, fries and milkshakes. What else can you say about this place, good price for fast food and they were pretty quick with my order. It was my first In N Out experience and I loved it, would definitely hit this place up next time I get out here. Cashier was nice, and they got my order right too which was great.</review><time>1569206486521< /time>< response>

<Text>Well everyone already knows in n out is amazing. Went through the drive through and got a #2 around 9pm and it took about 10 minutes which isn't too bad for in n out haha my only complaint is that I asked for ketchup twice and only got 3 packets, as if the ketchup packet cost comes directly out of their paychecks or something. Not enough to take a star off but still. Besides that I thought it was cool to have all the windows along the drive through to watch them do their magic :P was nicely packed and made for a delicious meal< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzNgYYvwEFSpzk5W5V3jM2NC-eOddo2xIT4tuf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

Out of all the fast food places, this is simply the best. Sure you gotta wait in a line half way down the block. In return. The reward is a fresh burger that satisfies everyone's taste buds. Prepare your pallet for the best burger from the best coast. And here's a tip for all you first timers... There's toppings you can add... :)< /text>

The service here is fast and friendly.  The food is always fresh and the order is accurate. It's a little crowded, but all In N Outs are, so there is no surprise there.<//Review>

Good service PLUS a lady walking around asking if everything was ok
Opening the door for customers. Picking up trash that the people next to me dropped and just looked at and did not pick up. I wish I had got her name she was so friendly and smiling. Owners..this was on Tues Feb 25th at noon so you can find out who she was.

This was at the one on Palmdale Blvd in Palmdale.< /text>

<text>That was the second worst burger I ever had. The fries were disgusting and tasted like old grease. The burger was bland mealy tomatoes added to terrible tasting sandwich that fell apart upon my second bite. I would never eat there again and will tell everyone I know not to. When everyone tells you that the fries are gross it should have been a fair warning.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c25830e3fe343b:0xfe2240aa05517259</GmapID></record>

Allergy-Friendly restaurant. Soy-Free (except for the bun), this is, like most in-n-outs I've been in Southern California, consistently good and freshly made food. Although not in a very "nice side of town." inside the restaurant and in the parking lot, the atmosphere feels like a good old fashion family restaurant.  Even a long line really does go fast. Food is great and priced right. Great service and friendly help.</text>

Parking is super tight in the actual lot with the drive through. The next door lot over by pizza hut seems to be a good spot to get in and out of more quickly. Other than uneasy,  standard in n out. Delicious, fast and friendly!< /text>

i like it because they are exact spot on in how they prepare the food and this is with every on n out burger,how they prepped ypur food ,cookrd,and served it to you  is the same quality regardless which one you order from i would have given all stars except the only downfall of this iconic chain is the wait ,,,, but thats not there fault that its always packed anytime any location is open,,Dang ! i want my burger NOW ( said the sniveling guy that happily waits his order every time) the volume of business should tell you right there this is a good place to eat!! awwwww c'mon where is my order! please ,petty please?< /review>

I've never gone to an In-N-Out and been disappointed. It's just not possible. Their menu is very simple but what they do serve is absolutely excellent. I've never had anything I disliked. I recommend trying secret menu items like the flying Dutchmen (meat, cheese, meat), or protein style (lettuce wrapped), or even the grilled cheese. The classic burgers are obviously fantastic but the secret menu items are fun and also with trying. Also the milkshakes are great with the fries in case anybody was wondering.< /review>

<text>Normally perfect, however, today the fries dried and crunchy; pickles we're on the burgers that were served on dry buns; the soda fountain was foaming and spitting, and not enough chocolate syrup in the shake.

Pleasant gal walking around did replace the fries with perfect fries.

Normally this location gets Five Stars.  Must have a lot of newbies.  Brought fountain issue to their attention, but not fixed during our dine-in experience.  Flat soda with not enough syrup is just not tasty.

We'll try this location in a month or two and give them another chance.<//text>< pictures>

<review>Very quick, a menu with two main items (burger and fries) lends itself to efficiency. The burger had great flavor and held together excellently. The fries were fresh, crisp and very lightly or unseasoned. Great value!<//review>< gmap_id>

<text>The only burger joint that I wait in line, like it is the end of the world and there's no where else to get food. The staff is always friendly and fast, the place is always packed and the food is always freshly made. Love it.</text><rate>5<//rate>< Resp>

<review>Double double had old lettuce and tomatoes that were yellow and unripe.  Bun was burnt and the condiments were messy on the sandwich. In n out has really changed over the years. When I first came to California 20 years ago it was the best burger in town. Thank goodness features has not changed!< /review>< GmapID>

Best burger, fries and shake. Always a line inside and at drive thru, but moves quickly.  Food is cooked to order, and hot! Clean restaurant, professional and friendly staff. Good prices!</Review>

Although the meat was well cooked the burger was served cold, especially because the salad leaves and tomato slice were cold, probably just taken out of the fridge. Plus the fries where rather dry, probably because they got cooked for too long.< /text>

The food is good but they have a female manager there with a bad attitude. They messed up my order and I had to walk back in the heat and she treated me as if I was lying. Didnt even get a sorry or anything!</Text>

What more can be said of any in-n-out that most don't already know? The food is great, made relatively quickly, prices are good and depending on the time of day it can be full of people. always worth the visit.</Review>

Great food, it's in n out, when I went though they forgot about me and served the next few people with the same order, waited about 10 minutes. One time occurence though, usually snappy.< /review>

In-N-Out is one of the most polarizing burger joints. Seems like folks love 'em or hate 'em. I'm in the love 'em category.

Do they make the best burger in the world? Nope, but it is a great FRESH burger with a dependably consistent quality that is the quintessential California original. That's the magic of In-N-Out. You always get a fresh burger that always tastes great. I've been eating at In-N-Out my entire life and have never had bad food or bad service.

Be sure to look up the secret menu, if you are unfamiliar with it. My order is always a double double animal style, animal style fries and a neapolitan shake. Always hits the spot.</text>

Good food made fresh get everything made " ANIMAL STYLE" and it's worth the couple of extra minutes to get it prepared that way. Delicious. Sometimes you've got to wait to get a seat but at least you know that you're getting fresh cooked food and hand cut fries.< /text>

In n out is great and although I had never been to this one the workers here were very accommodating. My husband accidentally ordered something different compared to what I wanted and they were able to fix the order for me at no cost. Delicious!< /Review>

The best hamburger in town, and still doesn't break the bank. This location gets really busy most of the time, but it's worth the wait for the amazing fresh-tasting delicious burger and the fresh-cut fries. Oh, and don't forget to try their shakes! Try the Neapolitan shake from their secret menu, and ask for whole grilled onion on your burger. Ok, I want an In-N-Out burger now..<//Text>

I'm always surprised by how well oiled the In-N-Out machine really is. When I pulled up the drive thru was crazy long as always but I was going to eat in anyway.  In the lobby there was a line but it moves fast as always. Food was great  person usual. I'm rating 4/5 stars not because I want to but I need to keep my ratings consistent. The lobby needed a little bit of up keep however; this was prime time for them so I didn't expect them to pull someone off the line just to pick up a few fries on the floor.

No surprise here, great place for burgers, fries, and milkshakes.

Would recommend everytime!< /text>

What can i say...it was very yummy! In-N-Out has a standard that makes them pretty much all the same with regard to cleanliness, professional staff and noise level. Plenty of parking.</review>

Burgers were classically delicious. Premises were clean and service was polite and quick. Parking was readily convenient to our surprise. Business was as at a usual constant.<//Review>

My sister and I met here on a Thursday afternoon and between 5 squirrelly kids, the kind manager came to check on with us twice, asking if he could help us bus tables, get condiments, or if we needed anything else. Great staff and delicious food.< /text>

Classic So Cal Drive through. Although whatever social or political changes each decade may bring this icon remains true through and through. The satisfying Double Double with french french fries and drink are no doubt a satisfaction guaranteed. If any negatives like all food joints lunch rush hour. Everyone from local fire department enjoy the taste of a Double Double which can make waiting a bother but worth it. The restraunt is well maintained spotless  clean and very well maintained. For me it is  always a pleasure whenever the chance a high recommendation for any out of Towner.< /Text>

Can never go wrong with In-N-Out; quality is consistent, hamburgers are the best and always first choice when on the road. Only slow when they are closed. Drive thru line usually has an employee working outside on drive to get you'r order going to keep you moving. All employees seem to have a "Happy Face Sindrome", are quite effecient, speedy and nothing rattles them.<//Text>

I really don't see what all the fuss is about. This seems like any other fast-food hamburger to me. Small, salty patties can be doubled up to make a meal. It's just not much different than Wendy's or McDonald's in my opinion. It will be nice when "Five Guys Burgers and fries" comes to the area. At least the people are very polite and efficient.</Review>

<review>Apparently there's a secret menu you can Google. I'm not from the area and I'd been driving for 4 hours. Do you think I care about extra fried fries? Yes, I do.

<Text>You don't go to in n out because they are quick. You go because they after delicious. But they typically mess up cheese fries by letting the cheese hang over the sides. I don't pay the extra $2 for it to be all over the cardboard. And they have by far the worst soda machines. I have never been so consistently disappointed with my drink.<//Text></record>

<review>Waited 20 -25 min in drive thru, got out food  fries were cold hamburger buns were also cold. It's been a while since li had  gone to in n out and it used to be worth the  10 minute wait. In my opinion no fast food should be ok with a 20 minute  wait.<//review>< Pictures>

Everything good that you would expect from an In N Out. I love their fries, strawberry shakes, and burgers. And the staff is top notch. Fast and efficient.< /Text>

In N Out has killer food no argument there, but it gets so packed, the staff there was so backed up they got our orders wrong, but I'm still giving them 5 stars because they were swamped, I think with a horde of people coming in like they were there's bound to be some issues<//review>

Location is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars. Parking, drive thru and wait times are always bad. The food and service is classic In-N-Out.< /Review>

<Review>Always on point with the food and super friendly service, only had 1 complaint in my whole life of eating here and they took care of me and my daughter above and beyond. They can be super busy though but know how to handle it.</Review>< pictures>

The burger was good and the staff friendly, but the fries were chewy and cold. When the fries were returned for fresh, they were dumped back into the frier for 30seconds to reheat and given back.<//Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>So many things to compliment at In and Out usually at any location. I had to use the restroom this visit. One thing you can usually always count on is that they will not only have a restrooms for the public. You can also count on being clean, working, and not with a huge hassle of asking for a key attached to a hubcap, a 16 digit passcode, a special token, or a guilt trip and irritated expression that someone is thinking they can just pee and go. (Like they are a special creature who doesnt expel waste)

I get it, no one likes it when homeless people turn what once was a happy clean and almost new looking potty place, into a room of filth because rhey used that sink to shower. Somehow In anf Our seens to know how that doesnt happen so much.<//text><time>1515582451360< /time>< Gmap_id>

I like this place. It's crowded most of the time, except in the mornings when they open (that's a given) and one of the employees is always high haha but he's cool and is very attentive.</Review>

Food is tasty! Way too many drug addicts and transient around begging for money. What it recommend this place for a family to eat way too much nonsense going on in that area. If you want it I would only recommend going through the drive-thru.</text>

<Review>Great atmosphere
Freshest food
Best prices

Except the value of the food is higher than the one on the menu

Is it possible to raise the price after not changing anything about the menu

I would also like to see the off the menu options<//Review>< Pics>
