They grow quite a bit of produce on site (and have two of the tallest pomegranate trees I've ever seen). They use a lot of local produce in their dishes so the menu changes frequently. I've included a picture of the menu from mid April 2021. They have tables outside on site. Good food for a reasonable price.</text>< Rate>

Fro & the whole staff are great!. Fun to interact with them. Love that they incorporate the fruits and veggies that grow there into the menu. Had so many tasty dishes there. Some of the best local beer insider selections. I don't even like cider and the ones he carries I crave. He smokes his own meats too! It's a little paradise getaway in West Sac.

It's such a charming place with the trees being 90 years old!

I've never been a regular anywhere I have lived but it's time I am and I choose here.

I would suggest the two tables in the center near the vegetable garden should have umbrellas at tilt to block the midday sun. You can see them in the first 2 photos. The back left corner table is MINE! 😁<//review>

Such a cute little oasis in West Sac! Fresh, delicious food and a good beer selection. Plus, a big outdoor garden area that you can eat and hang out in. I got the Meeseeks box and it was DELICIOUS!< /text>

<user_name>Jennifer Perez< /user_name><Response>None</Response><rate>4</rate><Review>The food was great as was the service. They've really done a great job expanding the backyard seating area. This was my first visit for dinner, prior visits were for coffee and also pre-pandemic. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my bf had the Shaolin style sandwich which was a 5 spice chicken sandwich. It was also very good. We also ordered the fingerling potatoes, potato salad and a.mixed green salad along with 2 canned beers. My only con about the place was it's a little pricey for an outdoor seating place. Our whole meal was $80, more than we would have spent at a regular restaurant. IMO a $12 sandwich should come with at least a small side or chips. BUT all the food was very tasty and I would probably go again, but I'll be better prepared for the final tab.< /Review><Time>1619988823802< /Time>< Gmap_id>

Live music on a Sunday afternoon to go with a nice, comfortable outdoor ambiance during February in northern California.  First time visit was very pleasant.  Friends enjoyed the setting and our discourse. Beer was unremarkable and we heard there was an hour to wait for food. Go with those expectations and you should be okay.</review>

This spot is a FANTASTIC little must experience place in West Sacramento.  The business owner has a long history in the restuarant scene in this city.  It's great to see him doing his thing with this place.  The vibe here is unique and fun.  The food menu is incredible and they literally grow some of the ingredients that they serve on their menu.  The beer selection they offer is good as well.<//text>

<review>Four stars because sometimes thier beer selection is limited. The food is good and thier patio is the best part. Lots of seating outside. They don't make it clear where to put your dishes when your done eating so I just kinda find a spot near the back door and leave my stuff.< /review>< Pics>

Only been here a couple time and I love the place!
The vibe is super calming, and it's beautiful out here.
I came here on a Monday, not knowing the place was closed and the owner of the place saw me and invited me to sit outside anyways, and even gave me a cup of Americano on the house!!

I truly appreciated that as I needed to get out of the house and get some school work done.

Highly recommended spot, run by very kind and sweet people.
The coffee and the food is also amazing!<//Text>

Customer service was 5stars for sure. They grow their veggies there. 😋 I got a free tomato appetizer.  Cute place with a very cute outdoor area. A must go to place.

I found this little gem with a friend when we were walking around downtown. Oh and their coffee is great. 👌< /review>

I love love love love the Treehouse Cafe.   I remember the day I was riding down the street and I passed this spot.  Something about it looked so peaceful and inviting.   I immediately busted a U turn and pulled over and I am so glad that I did.  I can’t say enough things you really have to see it for yourself.</Text>

Great local place to relax on a nice evening with a drink and some food. The outdoor seating is really neat amongst all the growing veggies and flowers.<//Text>

This is a fantastic location for this business enterprise.  The coffee is excellent, the service was exemplar, and the panini was very delicious. I highly reccomend going here, and look forward to whatever the owner will do with the rest of this corner, 3rd and G.  I will be back!!!< /Review>

What a hidden gem! It's a little house turned café. The ambience and atmosphere are so chill. The kitchen smelled amazing. Our waiter helped us choose the special for the day, it was shrimp tacos. 🔥 they didn't disappoint. Everything about this place is great from the moment you order to the moment you leave. They have a garden out back with plenty of seats under the shade. They use their produce from their garden to make meals. Can't say enough about this place!</text>

100% satisfied with the service and quality of the work. Super clean work.The car looks amazing, I couldn't be happier. Will be taking my other cars in to have them done. You want good quality work, that's what they do. You pay for what you get and what you pay is compareable to other great quality places I have used in the past. Definitely recommend if you want great work done.< /text>

<Review>I truly think that this company and the staff there are awesome!! Coming here & being able to meet with someone that can tell me & show the differences between the shades in tinting was phenomenal! From the moment that the service was completed it's been like driving a new car with less glare & better temperature control.. Thank you guys!!</Review><date>1603738265310< /date><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKg1vIOvg4b1YOeaYTjB-0HxL5Fadcb_82Trk7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGTR4i8LfOIjfObrg3ygba4jOYazzUlng1VoxM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< username>

<review>I had a 9 AM Saturday appointment with these guys and after spending almost $500 dollars on my tint (granted I bought the best one with full insurance) they STILL got things wrong.

1. My appointment was for 9 am and they had me drop off the car ALL day, and I never got a notice that it was finished, I had to call at 2 pm to find out it was done.

2. I picked up my truck and noticed they missed some slivers on the back windshield that wasn't covered. It was VERY noticeable as I was able to see it in my rearview mirror

3. I had asked them to fix it, which "they did" but the rest of the plate glass STILL had slivers missing. I had what seemed like a manager come out give me excuses that my truck is too old, and sometimes not even the computer cant cover it all and blah blah blah

To be honest it seemed like they just wanted to get out of there as it was saturday and 3 pm I get that. But I also spent $500 dollars there, so YES I do expect it to be PERFECT. Best believe that I WILL be returning this week to get my window fixed. This is ridiculous and I ABSOLUTELY expect them to make it right. Until then I'd stay away. I'll update my review with pictures of the tint, and will update my review in general IF they make it right</review><user_name>Jose Sida</user_name><user_id>109477494079431411013</user_id>< resp>
{'time': 1619968740618, 'text': 'Hello Jose thank you for coming in and we hope you can give us a chance to make things right. We understand the issue and will try our best to meet your expectations. The $500 was for the ceramic to keep out the heat but it doesn’t change the patterns or the seals on your vehicle. The 2003 trucks have a back windshield that has seals that are too tight on the glass so window film doesn’t tuck behind it to cover those gaps. There are 3 options 1. We install the pattern that XPEL gives us that covers 95% of the light (this option requires no removal of glass or trimming of the seal).\n2. Trim out the entire seal but that can give you issues in the future and looks very bad.\n3. Our neighbor the glass shop can pull the glass out completely and we tint the individual pieces allow them to dry and then stick them back in and let them dry. (This take the entire day and he usually charges a fee of around 170-200.\nWe hope you understand we are a small business and we do right by our customers. We made the best decision with the available options the vehicle gives to us. If the gap in the pattern concerns you then we should do option 3. Please give us a call on Monday we can discuss this further. As far as the 9:00 appointment this vehicle takes much longer because of the seals and we don’t finish in an hour because it is not a simple installation.'}<//resp>

<text>Easy to book an appointment. Friendly customer service. Very fair pricing. My 4 door sedan window tint was completed start to finish in about an hour. Very happy with RP Tinting in Lodi CA. Will be using them for ceramic coat paint protection next. I can trust they will do quality work.< /text>< Pics>

He said that these Tesla come defective from factory. You have to be kidding me!!!!Im assuming this happened when they were inside installing the rear window and installer kicked my door panels trying to maneuver inside.The guy I was texting about this issue, was denying ever bit of it. This guy had the audacity to ask me if the car is used. These guys come off as good people and if you look at the negative reviews, they reply trying to sound nice and guarantee 100% satisfaction, but when it comes down to making things rite, they deny everything and don’t hold themselves accountable, all I want is for them to make things rite.  DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!<//Review>< pics>

<resp>{'time': 1611432852454, 'text': 'Hello we just spoke to you and we told you before the install about the damage on the glass and you acknowledged the vehicles imperfections. Upon our inspection we saw ALL your panels were damaged before the install. We work on hundreds of Tesla’s every year and we don’t do any panel removal, sweep removal or glass removal on Tesla’s. The Tesla’s are frameless and the tint slides in place. What you are doing is defamation and can be addressed in a court. We have 8 camera 4 inside and 4 outside that clearly show us installing the vehicle with safety aprons and soft clothing. No installers are allowed to wear jeans or belts. Also all of your paint did have minor scuffing which our detailer told you is because of car wash machines (which is normal) and we don’t recommend that cars go through car washes because it causes imperfections in the paint. We are surprised to see you leaving us this review because when we spoke we showed you how we could FIX all of your swirl marks from car washes and now you want to say we are the ones who damaged it? Cmon least be real you want to get your $500.00 back. You then threatened to complain to the BBB but we have proof of the work we did. Window tint goes on the glass it has nothing to do with your panels. We understand that you may have not noticed them until you started looking at your panels which I would hope you consider that as a viable option. We are a good shop and take pride in our work I hope you consider removing this review because it is considered defamation.'}</resp>< gmapID>

Emailed RPTinting about getting my windows tinted ASAP. The staff got back to me within 30 minutes and was able to schedule me first thing in the morning the following day. The whole process was done and done within 2 hours and it turned out fantastic! I Couldn’t have asked for a better tint Job and the price was unbeatable! The staff was extremely friendly and explained the whole process, benefits, and possible downsides to each individual tint level making it a very enjoyable process for a first time tinter. Highly recommend RPTinting to anyone looking to tint their windows! Thank you!<//Review>

We came to get to Denali trucks tinted and the owner gave us a time and knowing we took the day off to get these done. When we showed up to pick up the truck dude just gave us excuses as to why after 3 hours of no call or thing job wasn’t even started. Unprofessional and told us to take our cars. I would not recommend this guy for nothing lost customer service. Wasted our time.<//Text>

I highly recommend RPFILMS in Lodi for their quality work and the quality of their material. Great customer service, they explain everything you need to know to make a decision of the tin you would want (if you’re like me, with no idea of what to get it's pretty helpful). They take care of your vehicle and have it ready fast. They also offer services like ceramics pro and clear bra paint protection. One stop for a full protection on your car.</Review>

<Review>I went here because I was looking for someone who has a lifetime warranty on the tint. They have two different types of product. One is his own brand the other is I believe 3M. When I went he was busy most of the day with appointments which usually means they are pretty good. The tint itself I have had no issues as of yet. It took about 90 mins to have it put on but that is average for the whole vehicle tint.< /Review>< Pics>

I remember using Julio when he was a 1 man mobile tech, he tinted 3 of my cars back in 2017.. since then between my wife & we have referred many friends to Julio.. in the last 4 months he’s done 5 vehicles for me as our kids have bought a few cars and my wife’s new car..

The Attention to Detail and the fit to your specific vehicle is what separates the good from the great. If you need any of his services Clear Bra, Tint & soon vehicle detail we Highly Recommend RP Tint in Lodi!< /text>

<text>Over the years I've gotten multiple vehicles tinted as well as my GTI vinyl wrapped. Julio is very professional and the shop is very well taken care of. I also had them window tint a new house I bought in 2019 & ceramic pro my master shower. I highly recommend you at least get a quote and check out the products and services they offer.< /text>< Pics>

<Rating>4<//Rating><review>Quality of the tint removal was excellent. Tech even helped remove decal glue from a sticker that was long gone. My only issue was that i was told very plainly that the price for removal would be 15$ per window. Then when I arrived they changed their tune and said two of the six windows would now be more than that.

I did not want to fuss and just chalked it up as a lack of communication from the person handling sales calls. Please be up front with your customers or you won't get much repeat business.< /review>< Pictures>

This place is the best tint shop around. I took my car there to have the whole car tinted and they did a excellent job for a reasonable price. They had my car done within 2 hours and got me in within a few hours of calling and not having a appointment. Highly recommend if you want your car tinted for a good price.< /Text>

<text>Had two vehicles done, pretty expensive but wanted to get the good quality tint, after letting them cure I came to find that one vehicle had dirt under a bunch of bubbles on the tiny, also bubbles on the tiny that has no dirt under it, and on my other vehicle everything looks good except for the corners and bottom of the tint. Way to much for such low quality.</text><Rate>2<//Rate><resp>{'time': 1552264821050, 'text': 'Hello we never heard any problems for you before can you send me photos to 209-280-6521 and see if we can help you out'}<//resp>< gmapID>

<text>STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!! They badly messed up my windows then gave me a nasty attitude about having to try to correct it.  They were unable to do a professional  job on my car so I had to have Ron's Window Tinting correct it.</text></record></dataset><record>

Honestly it was a decent experience I mean I wasn't jazzed about having to go take the corona vaccine for the second time but I did the follow-up and they were very professional how can I ask for the more? There were prepared fast quick and easy in and out I think they're doing a fabulous job and keep up the good work.< /Review>

< Review>
I feel I get great care from my Doctor (Dr. Khan) and all the staff are so helpful. Everyone seems to be looking out for mybest interests. The health information telephone sessions from Emily and Brenda are very worthwhile for anybody to be aware of diabetes/pre-diabetes health issues and goals. I am very pleased with the Optometrist and the Pharmacy which continuously evolve and improve since they were put in place.< /Review>

Honestly, I started going here about 3 years ago because my mom went there. Mr. Sumner is the absolute best!  I love all the staff, they are always
fast, courteous, and always answer any questions I have.  I never have a problem getting medications refilled.  I have my other family members going there now.  I would recommend them to anyone.<//review>

I love my doctor, he always listens to me and helps me. He knows me well. The pharmacy is great and always has my prescriptions ready in a timely matter and I have yet to run into any problems with them, this is a major plus for me. On top of that I can get all my blood work done there too<//text>

The waits are TERRIBLE!!! And my doctor can't even get the right labs or x-rays faxed over to the right places. Doesn't give me much faith in the actual care I'm getting if they can't even get a piece of paper filled out.< /Text>

I've been a patient with camarena for about 10 years.  Dr. Bernstein has been my doctor,  I love and respect him so much. He always listens to me and that means a lot to me.  I did change the pharmacy because it got to the point it was hard getting my medication.  But other wise I use all the service's camarena provid. Thank You Alllove always Eloisa Madrid.....< /Text>

Got a call for an apptmt to get covid vaccination.  Was able to make an appt for next day.  Smooth operation when I got the vaccination-filled out paperwork- got shot ' waited 15 minutes after in case of side effects.  In & out in 30 to 40 minutes.  Just a sore arm as an after effect.  Have a follow up appt for 2and shot.  Everyone was very helpful.<//text>

My experience was with a phone call. I am so glad we didn’t have to go in. They called me a day before to verify. The Dr called us directly and filled my prescription. You can’t ask for anything easier.< /Review>

Can’t believe how poor it’s rated, I always have a good experience, the waiting times always vary but nothing outrageous. I also love that they always have an open spot for same day appointments. The pediatricians that I have seen are very nice, same with the dentist department. I find it very convenient that they have dental, health, pharmacy, laboratory all together.</Text>

Front Desk could be more welcoming and polite. Otherwise Drs. and some medical assistants are great. Veronica always has great customer service when I call to schedule appointments, very kind in scheduling at times and days that are most convenient. Not like other girls I've had who tell me no, not able to make that appointments, just make another appointment when you come in the office💁.
Thank you Veronica for your great service.<//Text>

Receptionists lie to you about receiving lab results. It's was two weeks calling about my ultra sound results and they simply said that they had contacted the MCH and the radiologists had fallen behind I called that day to the MCH and the medical records department told me that my results wee ready for pickup.<//Review>

<user>106113243393000095234</user><Name>Jackie Rodriguez</Name><Date>1497588667478</Date><Rating>1< /Rating><text>This is in regards to scheduling. This place has probably given me the most issues with scheduling. Some times I'd cancel an appt and I would get an angry letter in the mail saying I missed my appt and that they would stop servicing you. My last time was scheduling an appt with the OBGYN. The doctor amd staff were good, It just didnt work out with my work schedule and there's always a LONG wait time. After my last visit, I received a call that I had an appt for an ultrasound in a couple of days. I had not scheduled nore was it recommended by my doctor to have it done yet, so I just canceled my appts. Camarena Urgent care I absolutely loved the doctor there, wish he was at the regular office.<//text>< pictures>

Lauren was wonderful and quite gentle. Often you might feel like a cleaning can be quite the production but she made it as least worrisome as can be. Highly recommend Lawrence Fung and his team for all your dental needs!</text>

<Review>I wish I could give this place 10 stars. After one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a dental office, I lost faith in the dentists of Los Angeles.

Dr. Fung completely changed my opinion. He's honest, empathetic, and meticulous with his work. He is someone I am recommending to all of my friends.

His staff is amazing, which was a wonderful sign. The entire environment is wonderful and I look forward to future visits.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Fung is confident, compassionate and consistent.  His work is quick, thorough and painless.  His hypos are whispers and all of his equipment is cutting edge.  His assistants are also as he is and his office staff is accommodating and excellent.  Beautiful office location and easy parking.  👌🏻❤️👍🏻🎉< /text>

Dr. Fung and his team are incredible in every sense of the word! From the beautiful office space, to excellent dental care, to the kindness shown by everyone there — I’m so happy I’ve finally found a dentist office that I love! Dr. Fung is conservative in his treatment — meaning that he will not have you undergo unnecessary dental work.  I recommend this office to all my family and friends — and they all love it here, too!<//Review>

Dr. Ray takes the time to explain dental care and procedures to both you and your child, to put them at ease. His staff is great about answering questions and resolving scheduling or billing issues. Plus there's a TV with Netflix in every patient room, to help keep fussy little ones calm. I highly recommend taking your kids to see them as soon as their first birthday.</text>< username>

Silicon Beach Dental makes everything painless - I mean that in every sense of the word!  They’re so accommodating with appointments, they are good at all that they do and they’re both professional and easy to talk to while you’re in the chair.  I recommend them highly.</Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>I recently went to Dr. Lawrence at Silicon Beach Dental after transferring from my previous dentist for years (I only switched because of the commute). He and everyone in the office were fantastic. My XR tech, and hygienist were very pleasant and knowledgeable, and I appreciated how sleek the office is and the technology of having my X-rays viewable on the screen right in front of me. I had an early cavity that Dr. Lawrence offered to trial fluoride varnish before jumping to a filling. I felt like he was considering the patient perspective, and trying to avoid pain and unnecessary charges. It was such a positive experience. I’m definitely coming back and will happily refer a friend!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Dr. Fung is easily the best dentist I've ever seen!
From high tech facilities and equipment,
To his excellent dental assistants,
To anesthetic injections so deftly performed that I'm not sure when they even happened,
To his genuinely conservative approach to dental care,
And quick, skillful restorations,
I could not be more pleased each time I see him.
If you need a new dentist, do yourself a favor and make an appointment with Dr. Fung.<//Review>

The office is very clean, staff is very nice, Dr. Fung is very nice and professional with a good sense of humor.  He worked longer on me than he expected to (thanks to me waiting over a year for a cleaning due to the pandemic), but did a thorough job.  I love that there is Netflix to watch at every seat, too.  I got one episode of Chef’s Table in.  Given that I have kids, I never get to watch a whole show at once so this was a treat...and with my feet up and my back partially laid back! 😂  I definitely recommend coming here.  I don’t know why I waited so long to switch dentists.  Dr. Fung is fantastic!<//text>< Resp>

I've tried many dentists and I have to say this was a great first visit.  My hygienist, Denise, ask me a lot of questions and was gentle on my teeth. Oh and she's very personable too!  Dr. Lawrence was super nice and didn't push for procedures I didn't need.  Definitely recommend!< /review>

Going to the dentist has never been one of my favorite activities, specially during vacations lol.
I was so relief when I walked into Silicon Dental, the staff is incredibly friendly and efficient, the office has a very welcoming and positive vibe and the best part was Dr. Lawrence’s predisposition to make my dental experience very pleasant and successful one.
I will now have to come back every time I visit LA.<//Text>

< Review>
The office is beautifully designed and decorated. The moment I walked in someone greeted me and every one else I encountered were also nice. I love that the dental hygienists walk you through your appointment before any work is done so you are fully aware of what to expect. Denise was so kind and thoroughly ensured I was okay throughout the duration of my cleaning. Betty, who took my digital photos, was also very kind. The doctor was thorough and answered all of the questions I had. I cannot stress enough how enjoyable my trip to this dental office was. I look forward to returning.</Review>

<Text>The whole staff is great. Before we walked in my son and I were greeted by Julie to take our temperatures and go over some COVID screening questions. It made me feel safe and confident from the moment we arrived. Then we met with Delia who was so sweet, great with kids and so knowledgeable. It was my son’s first visit to the dentist so again it just made it so much easier because she was so friendly and sweet with my son. I also felt like she took the time to listen to my concerns and she knew everything I asked, she was great. Then next came in Dr Ray, I work in the medical field so I’m a pretty good read on practitioners, in short another amazing person at this clinic. Not only is he a great dentist, but he is also a father so I felt like he understood my concerns as a parent as well. Just like the hygienist he is so knowledgeable and we went over A LOT, but I wanted that especially since this is my first child and I came in with questions, he knew all of the answers and had a great way to explain everything. I felt like every person here was sweet but also professional and did their job well, I did not feel rushed or uneasy at any point. I’m a very picky person because like I said I work in medicine so I’ve seen it all. This is a great place to bring your kids. Would highly recommend them and I already have to a few friends who did not have the great experience we did. My son did get a little scared mid way and they were great about it, brought him a toy he could keep, it was packaged, etc and germ free. Like I said no brainer this place is amazing!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

No other dental office visit will ever compare. Seriously top notch! I found this office while searching for a trustworthy dentist on yelp over a year ago. When they say pictures say a thousand words...it sure applies to Dr. Lawrence and his team. You can see the “love” in the photos. From the moment you enter their dental office—it’s a completely different vibe than your traditional dental office visit. We are talking about modern decor, art gallery feel, friendly and chill atmosphere. Dr. Lawrence and staff are very kind and professional. It’s a wonderful experience all around. Thank you Dr. Lawrence and team for being so amazing!<//Text>

<Text>It's hard to find a dentist that isn't just good at his craft, but has a great location, friendly staff, and state of the art equipment. When I say spared no expense, Dr. Fung really went out of his way to make sure his patients felt comfortable when visiting and was blown away by the service and atmosphere.< /Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< username>

Everyone I interacted with was so sweet, from the front desk to the assistants to Dr. Saad herself. And the cleaning and scans were insanely thorough! My teeth feel hella smooth, and I feel much more accurately educated about how to take charge of my own dental health. Five stars</Review>

Absolutely outstanding in every single way. I have a major MAJOR fear of the dentist. The whole staff at SBD goes out of their way to make me comfortable and calm. The office is gorgeous, doesn’t even feel like a dental office, the reception staff is competent and very on top of scheduling, answering questions and taking care of billing and insurance for you. I love love love this place I am so happy to have a trustworthy dentist on my side</Text>

First impression, this office is clean, and welcoming. Dr. Ray was informative and easy to talk to, he took the time to go over and advise dental care/routine that is age appropriate. Staff (forgot their names) were also helpful, and friendly.

I look forward to future visits!<//text>

From the front office to back office, the experience was excellent. Beautiful new office and exam area. They are doing an amazing job keeping everything sanitized and safe during the pandemic. Dr. Ray is always excellent with my kids and never afraid to go to his office. If you’re new to the area and looking for a pediatric dentist, you will not be disappointed here.</Text>

<text>Dr. Ray and his team are fantastic.  My daughter enjoyed her first visit to the dentist and came home excited about brushing and flossing her teeth!  I'm so glad that she's establishing good habits now and developing a positive association with going to the dentist.  There were a lot of extra precautions due to COVID that made us feel safe.  I will definitely recommend Dr. Ray to other parents.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Date>

If you want your kids to have a great experience at the dentist, then go see Dr. Klein. Everyone is so friendly and just wonderful. And he is a great dentist. The procedures during covid make me feel extremely comfortable bringing my boys in. We left the office today and my child told me how much he loved coming in.< /Review>

This was by far the best dental experience I’ve had!  Each person that I interacted with at the office was caring and friendly. The doctor, the hygienist, and the woman who took my xrays were very considerate of my comfort and clearly explained each part of the process and the results of my examination.  For some reason I’ve always felt suspicious going to the dentist, sort of like taking my car to dealer for routine inspection, but this time was totally different. My experience with Silicon Beach Dental felt like a true healthcare appointment by professionals that I can trust.<//Text>

<review>Dr Fung is by far the best doctor I have ever been to. I am someone who tends to have anxiety when going to the dentist but he has this wonderful disposition and makes you feel calm and collected.
His staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and professional.
Appointments are prompt. You don’t have long waits. The office is not only pristine but very bright and welcoming. Not like the typical cold dental offices.
I’ve had a few procedures done and he definitely has a great hand.
Most important is that he’s super accommodating and both times I’ve had an emergency I was able to get in right away.
Finally, I do not have dental insurance and find that his fees are fair and reasonable for exceptional service.
Highly recommended.</review>< pictures>

<text>We started out at a different local pediatric dentist with my oldest. All of the things they did wrong, Dr. Ray does right. He has a gentle, kind and fun way with kids, his hygienist and office staff are sweet, patient and skilled, and he has great anecdotes to get us all through what can be a high-stress situation (he really is great at making us all feel more at ease!). My kids (ages 2 and 4), previously terrified of the dentist, have done amazing with him. Can't recommend him enough. And the new offices are gorgeous.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b0acfa2acfd7:0xd8950b332a99b537<//Gmap_id></record>

I came to SiliconBeach.Dental, at the recommendation of my Orthodontist, for veneers. The whole process took a little over a month, but each appointment felt like I was going to just hang out with friends. The end results look like natural teeth. It's Amazing how perfectly matched the veneers turned out, even my Orthodontist was impressed. Drs. Fung and Shahira are the BEST! Not only do they do phenomenal work, they create a phenomenal experience. The office is clean and up to date with the latest technologies. They are welcoming, fun, diligent, have killer attention to detail and truly care about the work they do. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! Highly recommend!!</Review>

< review>
When you're 8 years old and only think of the dentist as being a bad place and then you visit Dr. Ray and realize that visiting the dentist is not bad at all.    Thanks for the new outlook on getting my teeth cleaned. Fantastic place to visit kid friendly and walked away with clean teeth and a YOYO!!!!!!!!< /review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Dr. Fung is the BEST.  I have been going to his office for 2 or 3 years.  I drive all the way from Irvine, to Culver City, because after 5 different dentists told me they couldn't match a single tooth after a root canal (they all said I would have to get crowns on ALL my visible front teeth, so they'd all be white), Dr. Fung helped me through the process, with minimal work done, and minimal expense.

He referred me to a WONDERFUL endodontist, to have the root canal done.  I didn't even need a crown.   Not a single one, let alone the 8-10 I was being told I needed by other dentists.

My root-canaled tooth is intact.  The endodontist just drilled a tiny hole in the back.

Then, Dr. Fung did bleach treatments INSIDE my dead tooth, to keep it from being discolored.  No, my teeth are not all pearly white.  My tooth looks just like it did before the root canal.  That's what I needed.  That's what I can afford.

I found Dr. Fung on instagram.  When I was searching for help with my root canal...his page popped up in my feed.  The picture was of a patient he had where he matched ONE tooth the the rest of their teeth.  All of the patient's teeth were kind of discolored, and I LOVED that he took a conservative approach.  You don't NEED pearly white crowns on all your teeth.  You don't NEED veneers.  He can give you the most stunningly perfect white smile of all time if that's what you want, but he ask about what you want, and LISTENS.

He listens to what patients want and need, and does not upsell or push ANY unnecessary services.

As long as I live within 100 miles, I will not go anywhere else.

Bonuses:

-he is GREAT at responding to emails.  He doesn't have to be.  I would understand if the front desk staff emailed me back instead of him.  I would understand if he emailed me back days later...but he is always ON it.  Quick response time.

-great at answering all questions

-absolutely gorgeous facility.  everything is SO modern.  I could live there.

-the music is ALWAYS amazing

10/10: highly reccomend</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

This place is terrific in every way...the ambiance, the high standards, the wonderful hygienists and dentist.  They are state of the art--for instance, xrays are taken easily and quickly with a hand held device--not that horrid affair where the operator had to leave the room or hide behind a wall to push the camera button.   They just do things better here.<//review>

The entire experience from beginning to end was lovely and I usually hate the dentist. Thank you SiliconBeach team for the high quality care!< /text>

Such a great place, couldn’t recommend them enough. I’ve been coming here for maybe over 2 years now and although I no longer live in the area, I will gladly make the hour commute to get seen by Dr. Lawrence and his team. Whether I’m seen by my usual hygienist or Dr. Lawrence, they always explain what they are doing, answer my slew of questions that I most undoubtedly have and will even respond to questions I have over email. The atmosphere is very welcoming and I love that I can watch something on Netflix while I get something done. I am ashamed to admit that hardly went to the dentist prior to going to Silicon Beach Dental because I hated the overall dentist experience but I can honestly say that I look forward to my cleanings now. Again, couldn’t recommend this place enough.<//text>

<Text>I can earnestly say I have never had such a positive experience with any form of medical care, dental or otherwise, than my experience with Dr. Ray.

The process of safety in the age of covid was something that was of a major concern for me and I couldn't have imagined a better experience. Super clean in their brand new spacious office, only one client in the entire office at the time, and thorough protocols practiced throughout.

As a parent Dr. Ray explained everything to me so thoroughly that I not only felt confident in his chosen provided care, but also educated and empowered with how to help my own son.

My son has been to a few dentists and he just loves how Dr. Ray treated him with fun and respect, from sharing with him in how he was tackling the "sugar bugs" to a la carte Netflix on an extended TV arm, all the way to the fantastic selection of toys at the end of it. We feel very lucky to finally find our dental home. I don't review very often, but I really felt this place deserved it. Great work to Dr. Ray and the entire staff at Silicon Beach Pediatric Dentists.</Text>< resp>

Here are five focused factors in my 5-Star rating:
1) CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONALISM  and personal courtesy of Dr. Lawrence FUNG, owner and chief practitioner at Silicon Beach Dental.
2) OUTSTANDING EFFECTIVENESS and kindness of entire Staff, from receptionists-to-technicians-to-dental hygienists-to-part time dentists. Their GRACE simply amazing!
3) EXTRAORDINARY IMPLEMENTATION of latest TECHNOLOGY, from dental equipment to displays, prescribed protocols and range of information services involved in appointment scheduling and follow-up. Minimum wait times. Even music is calming w/o being MUZAK taxing.
4) TEACHING MOMENTS for children and elderly alike by all Staff regarding newest policies and procedures employed in treating clients. (This is a prime reason why my family, including young grandchildren have adopted Silicon Beach Dental to be our GO TO PRACTICE among hundreds of Dentists & Dental Clinics in L.A. County. This method translates to both greater understanding of work performed and a Best Practices approach to the patient’s personal dental hygiene between visits.)
5) STRICT ADHERENCE to and Observation of CDC/State of CA/Local COVID Pandemic Guidelines. Reflective of a “We’re All In It Together” Spirit and Care.

At the age of 73, having served in jobs and organizations all over the globe (Asia, Europe, South & Central America, the Caribbean and other regions), I’ve been exposed to many different Dentists and Dental Operations. Dr. FUNG and company are among the Top-Three anywhere. As such, Silicon Beach Dental receives my highest personal recommendation for anyone needing theses ESSENTIAL Services.</text>

<Text>Dr Ray is absolutely THE BEST pediatric dentist around! My 5 year old daughter LOVES going to see him. He's done mini crowns and fillings on her and she has literally giggled through the treatment and skipped laughing out of his office. I don't know how he does it. I and my daughter had pretty traumatizing experiences before Dr Ray- to the point I was dreading and afraid to take her to the dentist again. Dr Ray had her come in for two visits before any treatment- to just get her comfortable with the office and having her mouth looked at. Now she has no fear of the dentist and it is so wonderful to know that she is in great hands. Plus the office helped out with payment plans when we lost our insurance for a year and got us all set up when we got it back. I can't recommend Dr Ray enough. Every mom I meet who has taken her child for treatment to him has one thing to say "Dr Ray is the best!" Plus he has a really great selection of toys in his treasure chest of after-treatment prizes.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Great spot to take care of your pediatric dental work! They are pros at making the dentists’ office a fun and exciting experience.

The office has a great vibe and has to be the swankiest dental clinic I’ve ever been to. We were greeted with a warm welcome from Julie and Dr. Ray is definitely a master of his craft. He kept our boy’s attention throughout the exam and gave me a very thorough explanation of my duties as a parent for our son’s dental routine.

Highly recommend!<//review>

We had a great 1st visit for my son (2YO). It was super easy to make an appointment (online). Julie was very helpful in checking our insurance and providing information on the visit and costs up-front. Dr. Ray was very knowledge and friendly and let my son play with the chair controls. The office is amazing...not your typical dental office. Very inviting and calming, or fun, if you're a kid. We had fun with the tooth chairs/stools and the wall mural :)
Parking (for the first hour) is validated.
Personally love the ability to contact them via email and make appointments online. Perfect for the odd hours when I remember to do these things.</Text>

My dentist in NYC recommended him when I was moving to LA and I can't thank her enough. He is gentle and explains the process in detail. The office is very clean and I don't remember waiting there at all. Unfortunately, I don't have dental insurance unfortunately but Dr. Fung helped me with payment plans and has been very understanding and helpful. The last time I saw him was right after Covid19 reopening and I was so relieved to see that he took all the necessary measures to keep everyone safe (everyone wearing masks at all times, hand sanitizers all over the place, only one person at the waiting room). One last thing, I know this shouldn't be a criteria when you are looking for a new dentists but I like that they have small screens where you can watch Netflix when you are going through procedures. Overall, I love Silicon Beach Dental and would def recommend it.<//text><Time>1592279043515<//Time>< gmap_id>

Their treatment plans are clearly evidence-based, not just trying to tack on as many services as possible like I've seen with other dentists.

<Review>What a wonderful experience.  The office  is sleek, modern, airy and with a welcoming and open design.  From the moment one enters there is a serenity that defies the traditional idea of being in a dental office. The staff - competent and compassionate; I likened the experience to that of a spa - comforting and serene - idea setting to receive oral health care. I actually can't wait for my next visit!</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2b0acfa2acfd7:0xd8950b332a99b537<//gmap_id><rate>5<//rate>< user_name>

Just moved to Los Angeles and found Dr. Klein. The practice is impeccable, clean and so well designed. The staffs couldn't be more friendly and helpful and most importantly, my daughter loved sitting and having her teeth worked on by Dr. Klein. He was kind, friendly, informative and had excellent mannerism with a child. Highly recommend.</review>

<text>Our daughter was very excited about her first dental checkup - until we got there...Dr. Ray put her at ease and had her laughing in no time.  He made it such a great experience for both of us that now she is happy to go back.  He is extremely knowledgable, up to date and progressive in his approach.  He was also really great about teaching both me and my daughter the best way to care for toddler teeth.  And added bonus, the office is rad.  i want one of those chairs
at my house.  Does NOT feel like your typical dental office.< /text>< pictures>

I had an excellent experience with Dr. Lawrence with his internal bleaching procedure that he offered me. It worked wonders and the difference is clearly visible. I am very happy with the work that was done on my teeth. I highly recommend coming here due to the extremely friendly and open atmosphere that you will not find typical in other dental offices.<//Review>

I haven't been to a dentist for over 15 years and that's my entire adult life. I was nervous about how severe the need for better dental maintenance was going to be. Yet from the gorgeous receptionists to the hygienist and surgeon I couldn't of been more at ease, and of course the Dentist as well. Everyone was extremely informative and kind, and they all have great personalities. Their service and customer experience is top notch from the less than 2 minute wait to the cleanliness of the office. If you don't have a permanent dentist here's one worth trying.

You wouldn't guess it but the dentist was a Marine which to me it's important to offer our veterans that added support after their terms of service.< /text>

"Dr. Ray" as he goes by for the kids is a father of two. He's the real deal and amazing at what he does. His own father was a dentist, so he has answered a family calling which suits him naturally. Along with his training at one of the country's top dental schools, he has the perfect touch and tone with children. He never talks down to your child, but speaks directly to them as an equal with a natural manner that puts them at ease. He lets a child warm up to him at their own speed.

We were referred to Dr. Klein after a negative experience at another office. The previous doctor and staff missed a major cavity molar that we spotted the weekend right after her annual check up. On top of that, when my wife took her back, the doctor told us he would have to do a root canal, lectured her and was even short with my daughter for taking one too many stickers. So we were all in a vulnerable place.

What a breath of fresh air Dr. Klein was in contrast. First, he told us he would not automatically do a root canal but would examine things closer up. Upon further examination of her X-rays and when we came in, he determined a root canal was overkill. He took the time to answer all of my wife's questions without being condescending, but with actual interest and curiosity. She was also able to sit with my daughter during the fillings, as he explained each step of the process to her. He's a wizard at administering the initial Novocain shot, which she was certain would scare my daughter. She didn't even notice it. She did not flinch or cry. She says he truly has a masterful hand and would not have believed it if she had not seen it.

She was expecting the the fillings procedure to be at the very least slightly traumatic for our four-year-old, but instead it was a pleasant and positive experience, where we were given great advice and support before, during and after. Our daughter's view of her new dentist, Dr. Klein is fun loving and trusting. She calls him fondly "Dr. Ray."

The office staff is also great, helpful, patient, and genuinely cheerful. The office space is modern with a waiting room that is quirky cool and stocked with (clean!) and clever toys your kids will actually want to play with. The entire appointment was scheduled to take one hour and it did on the nose, even with all the questions and allowing time for my daughter to settle in. Time by went by without anxiety. We were never rushed.

Leaving this office, you realize everyone is there because they truly enjoy and take pride in their work. And they should because there is tremendous value in what they do. Thank you, Dr. Ray and team!< /Text>

Hope you have a great week!'}</Response><review>Dr Fung and his crew is the best dental practice I’ve gone to. Their offices are great (love the Netflix!) their equipment is new and modern (say hello to lower radiation doses during X-Rays since it’s all digital!!!) and above all, they are genuinely nice, caring people. I’ve never been a big fan of dentists but every visit at Dr Fung’s office changes that opinion and makes me wonder why can’t all dentists be Dr Fung.

9/4/20-- I just wanted to update this since we now live in a COVID-19 world. Their offices were, as always, super clean. They took my temperature before they started work on me, hand sanitizer was omnipresent, staff wore masks,  the dental hygienist and Associate Dentist both wore N95 Mask+a disposable mask over that, plus a Face shield. Each room, including the waiting room, had it's own HEPA Air Purifier and literally everything had single use plastic over it that could be changed out between patients (including the Netflix TV Remote control!).  They briefed me on how they've altered their cleaning practices to reduce aerosols to avoid any possible spread as well as their cleaning practices. Overall, I was impressed with their attention to detail, preparedness, sanitation, and of course, how pleasant they were! Even though we're in the middle of a pandemic, they're still serving up smiles, and for that I'm grateful for.

I was hesitant to go to the Dentists, but having seen their preparations and precautions, I'm confident of my safety, and just as important, theirs! Thanks Dr. Fung and Team, you are all truly the best!< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2b0acfa2acfd7:0xd8950b332a99b537<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>
<review>Dr. Fung is now my favorite dentist.  I love his office.  It is so modern, and not like the other outdated dentists offices I've visited in the past.  More dentists need to follow Dr. Fung's example!  It was an all around great experience going here.  I'm definitely coming back!< /review><response>None</response>< rate>

The cleanest and friendless practices I have even been too. You can tell they really care about the quality of their work when they take the time to coach you on methods of keeping the entirety of you teeth clean.  Thanks Alyssa, Dr. Lawrence and the entire SBD Staff. This is the cleanest my teeth have ever looked/felt!< /Review>

Update!!

I just had the BEST emergency dental experience you can have at the dentist. I'm a total wuss when it comes to dental work. Hate the sound, taste, vibrations and smell. All of it. This is the first dentist I've been totally at ease with in my 50 years.

Weird to say and I'm sure weird to hear but listen to this.
Had a lunch where I managed to jam a chip into my gum. Tried to work it out with flossing, tooth pick, brushing and water. It was up there and it was giving me a throbbing headache and the gum pain sucked. I called Silicon Beach and Dr. Fung. They got me into the office on January 3rd, a Friday of New Years week when I'm sure they were crazy busy. Once I said I was in pretty intense discomfort they went above and beyond to get me in so Dr. Fung could work his magic. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Fung and his staff. and that's why that was the BEST emergency dental experience I've ever had.<//text>

< review>
I came in for my cleaning this morning at 9am and was greeted by the friendly and hospitable front desk staff. They offered me Coffee, Tea, and water which I thought was very nice. I didn’t wait much, then was called in to begin my cleaning which was completely painless and very thorough.

Dr. Lawrence Fung then came in to do his examination, he’s super friendly and I can tell he really cares about his patients!!!  I asked about getting Invisalign and teeth whitening so he then scanned my teeth and sent in my files so I can get an estimate. I really appreciate him taking the time to go above and beyond with my requests even though it was not part of my original appointment.

I’ve been Dr. Lawrence Fung’s patient since he first opened in 2017, I’ve recommend many of my friends and colleagues to Silicon Beach Dental because of their excellent work. I’ll continue to recommend them because of their high level of professionalism and high standards in customer service!

SiliconBeach.Dental makes going to the dentist Fun, Friendly, and Painless!!!  If you don’t like going to the dentist, you should start going here and your perspective will change instantly!

Thank you to all the staff at Silicon Beach Dental and most importantly, thank you Dr. Lawrence Fung!!!<//review>

Dr. Fung and his team are BY A LANDSLIDE the best dental practice and team that I have ever had the pleasure of being part of (that includes the U.S. and abroad). Dr. Fung is knowledgeable, patient, excellent at what he does, caring, and also of the utmost integrity. He will never recommend an option to get more money out of anyone. His primary concern is his patients and how well and diligently he treats them.

His entire team is as friendly and as welcoming as it gets and they genuinely care about their patients. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Dr. Fung and his office. In any other office, having TVs and Netflix while getting treated would probably be the highlight of an appointment but here it is just a little extra that makes this place cool on top of being fantastic.

Last but not least, he only works with top notch practitioners when it comes to his referrals, whether it is periodontists or the labs that he works with. If you live in the LA area, don't make the mistake of going anywhere else.

THANK YOU SO MUCH DR. FUNG FOR ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME :)<//Text>

Brought two bicycles for tune-up; one bike had a flat tire. Was able to pick up both bikes before estimated date. Great service, very fair prices. Chris and John are very honest. Wouldn't go anywhere else for bike repairs.< /Text>

This is a very accommodating business. I arrived late and he excepted my business. I appreciate the flexibility and the service. Price to fix two tires was extremely reasonable. Thank you Anderson’s Mower & Bike!<//Review>

Been going to Jon and Chris’s shop for years. Always helpful and go the extra mile to get what I need. And they’re pros at bike repair. Support your local bike shop and buy a real bike rather than cheap box store garbage!</text>< user>

The gentleman behind the counter was very nice.. I had driven there from Stockton since a bike shop there was no help at all the gentleman behind the counter says that I wasn't the only one that said this about this particular shop, that he has picked up a lot of business since that bike shop in Stockton really doesn't care about their customers as this gentleman did.. thank-u Anderson mower and bike...A+<//text>

These two brothers are the bomb! So helpful, great prices, and knowledgeable. I’ve been taking my bikes, lawn mowers, and just took my cadet there. Been a customer for over 15 years. I’m never disappointed! Stacey</Text>

I ordered koobedeh dinners. The meat was moist.. I'm really not sure what they used for ingredients but it just didn't seem quite right.   The meat was tough. Other than that the rice was good and the bake tomatoes were great.</text>

I took it down to Anderson’s and I asked them to tune it up and set me up with new pedals, Tires, seat and different handlebars. The bike was done very quickly and it looks great and feels great. The prices were very reasonable and they made some great recommendations for me and they know what they are doing.</Text>< pics>

I'm not in any way shape or form a bicycle expert. But I agreed to help my 9 year old part together a bike. Came here on a Saturday afternoon and the (I assume owner) was incredibly helpful and nice. We even talked a little bit about "old Manteca" and that the business has been there since the mid 70s. Shop local, shop small business and shop here.<//Review>

First off, there was no professionalism in this guy, Chris, who I asked for some assistance in getting my daughter’s brakes adjusted on her BMX bike. I let him know that my wife and I tried to adjust them to work better but we just couldn’t get it to where my daughter would have an easier time squeezing both brakes and stopping.

He then went on to say to the extent of, that the bike is crappy yet he would still be able to adjust them. HELLO??!! Who says that?! Might I add that my daughter who is 12 is standing next to me and the guy Chris deems it necessary to speak his mind to include the negative connotation on what he thinks of the bike. I was going to give this guy and Co. my business but I thought about it and said no and walked out.

I know that the $12 you quoted me isn’t going to impact your business any but I hope this review does and lends credit to that one person who is thinking about going to you folks to support local businesses since you’re like the only bike shop in town and sways their decision to go elsewhere.

I didn’t think it was necessary for you to say what you said. Be professional in dealing with customers and keep your nasty comments to yourself next time and provide a service to the community in a decent manner.</text>

<text>First let me say, this place did not pay me nor give a discount for writing this and im not gaining anything for my review and normally I dont take time out to do this for any other place but this place has been so helpful, awsome and affordable that I had to share. I highly recommend Anderson's and if your looking around, you dont have to look any further. Come to this place. Trust me.

(Translated by Google) They managed to fix my bike although I am still not completely convinced since I had to take it a second time for the same imperfect, covering the guarantee of the first service, however now it works. The attention of the personnel who attends there should improve or take a course on customer service. Since they are not very cordial and friendly, if a client does not understand they should repeat him a thousand times until he understands in such a way that he leaves happy: D I still recommend going there.

(Original)
Lograron arreglar mi bicicleta aunque aún no estoy del todo convencido ya que me toco llevarla por segunda vez por el mismo imperfecto, cubriendo la garantía del primer servicio, sin embargo ahora funciona. La atención del personal que atiende ahí debería mejorar o tomar algún curso sobre atención al cliente. Ya que no son muy cordiales y amigables, si un cliente no entiende deben repetirle mil veces hasta que entienda de tal forma que el se vaya feliz :D Igual les recomiendo ir allá.</Review>

An exceptional cuisine experience! Service was off the chart. I was greeted with a smile and sincerity. My sandwich was amazing, and their food is locally sourced. A must stop if you're looking for good food with stellar service. Family centered establishment. Veteran friendly. Highly recommended.<//Review>

First time here today after Stadium Park hike to the Monolith. UNBELIEVABLY excellent Reuben sandwich and Jalepeno coleslaw. I am not a serial reviewer, however the absolute quality of lunch due to fresh local ingredients? and quick caring service made our time today OUTSTANDING! If you haven't been there.. go!< /Text>

We tried their fish and chips and were both absolutely amazed! It was delicious and hot (we picked up to go). We will definitely be back to try other things!<//Review>

<text>My favorite deli and go-to sandwich place, thought they have way more on offer! The food is always fantastic and tasty, and staff are friendly and helpful. Owners Joanna and Shane are outstanding people, always welcoming and have a kind word for everyone. Hands down the place I bring friends and family who come to town for visits and they always eat well and enjoy the experience. Can’t say enough good things about it!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<username>Terra Agueda< /username><Text>Lovely place, nice outdoor eating area.
They have great menu options for anyone. They offer salads and sandwiches. They also have a nice wine and beer on tap selection.
I shared a BLT and the chicken ceaser salad with a friend and it was really good. Fresh greens, crispy bacon.
Kids menu is basic- grilled cheese, PBJ, etc. I recommend ordering a real sandwich!< /Text>< Rate>

<Text>Always friendly service and a great menu to choose from.  The lunch meat is fresh; it doesn't have the pre frozen texture you might find at other chain sandwich places.  Would suggest going here if you're interested in getting a tasty sandwich and supporting the local community.  Also great outdoor seating!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80ecc3bb119e54fb:0x2ebd6d114d47dabf< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

The menu items looked pretty good but the service was unimpressive. I was not acknowledged when I was standing at the counter and it took a while to get her attention because she was busy talking to the male customers. I was discouraged about coming back because of the first impression.</review>

Great atmosphere. Had the cubano and the BLT with the added turkey. Liked both but there could be improvements to both. The duck fat fries definitely were not as good as they should have been. Frozé was extremely sweet (even for a frozé)

Will definitely be back to try other items

Had the cluck chicken sandwich and a salad this time. Very big let down...the chicken was very dry and only covered half the bun.</Text>

We really enjoyed this place. They make high end sandwiches, either straight off the menu or design your own from scratch. Excellent wine selection and beers on tap. The stars of the show were the duck fat fries. These were like McDonald's fries (admit it, you know they're great) with the flavor cranked up to 11. Friendly charming service. We coming back.< /review>

Counter staff were helpful and friendly, which gave them 4 stars.  Menu is not vegan or plant based friendly - only one sandwich available that could be altered to be plant based.  It was okay.  There's a build your own option, but again, nothing exciting for plant based eaters.  Good reviews on the meat based sandwiches from the rest of the party, so worth a try for those who eat meat.< /review>

Great food, cute setup but there a little on the expensive side.</Text>

Good food and friendly staff in a cool location. I remember hanging around this place when it was an auto shop as a kid. Nice to see it being used as a deli!</Text>

Delicious food! I'm always impressed each time I try a new sandwich. This place has a SLO vibe. Seems like they are still ironing out the kinks during the lunch time rush, as it still takes around 45 minutes during peek times to get a sandwich. I like the style of the place, the beers on tap, and everyone is super friendly. Happy to support business in Atascadero!< /Text>

<text>Was really hoping atown could get a half decent sando place. I waited too long and place was not busy. For 11 bux. I was very very disappointed! For 11 bix a veggie sando should have at least an inch thick sando. And thats with no meat. Fix it or unfortunately another place will fail in atown.< /text>< user_id>

They didn't have my original order available and as a result gave us a dessert.  Possibly one of the best pieces of cake ive ever eaten thus i say dont skip the dessert.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Thier spicy rating is on point. Its spicy but still has flavor. All the food is good here but the loaded fries are the best!
The only thing I would change is making there coleslaw using a variant of the house sauce because that house sauce can be put on card board and you would eat it.<//review><user_name>Cody Smith< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

<review>Continuing my fried chicken sandwich tour, I came to Kluckin Chicken after choosing it from the plethora of options available in LA.  Looking through their pictures what stood out to be me right away was the French roll.  This is the only place that I know of right now that offers the option of getting the sandwich in a French roll.  Honesty, I was skeptical at first with trying the French roll. However, after trying it I now wish more places would offer this option!  The shape of a chicken tender fits so well into the roll that it genuinely makes me wonder why more places don't consider this as an option.< /review>< Response>

<username>Mike Ziolek<//username><time>1593630007473<//time><response>None<//response><Review>Unique "street food/outdoor restaurant" that is a car wash by day and converts over in the evening to serve up tasty hot chicken. Easy to get to right off of exit 16 going south on 101 (you'll see them cooking up their culinary goodness from the exit ramp). Having had fried chicken from Boston to Los Angeles and everywhere in-between, I can definitely say Hot Motha Clucker is high up on my list for a particular flavor.

For a first time, I'd suggest trying the two tender meal. It'll let you get a taste of their chicken (this is boneless tender chicken) on buttered toast. Make sure you make it a doozy (adds cheese and honey for an extra two bucks). Another option to try is the saucy, never dry Chef Special. You'll get a unique combination of their tasty fried chicken chopped and mixed into a grilled cheese, all nestled between two slices of buttery toast. Both of these come by default with their crispy and salty fries.

Oh, and when the person handing out your order asks if you want sauces, make sure you say yes. Nothing like being able to dip a salty french fry or fried pickle into soothing cool ranch sauce or their peppery ranch variety (they'll give you both by default).< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c297b9f032979b:0x5b9199a4315122d8<//gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating></record></dataset><record>

This place always satisfies my cravings. I usually go to the Sherman oaks location. I was in West Hollywood when I randomly noticed they have a location here too. I'm so glad because it's so close to my fiancé's house. I tried out their wings for the first time and I think it's my new favorite. My fiancé got the wrap with cheese and that was really good as well. Next time I'm going to try their fried pickles.</Text>

I have ordered from here so many times before and I was never disappointed, great chicken lots of flavor. yesterday we ordered food from here and everything came so greasy, why?  I bit into the spicy chicken and the grease just went pouring down both my elbows.  my wings were so greasy that the bottom of the carry out container was not visible, it had orange grease all around it.  I really hope this is a good learning opportunity to maybe let the food sit out on the paper towel first or something to decrease the grease. :) this is the only suggestion, everything else is delicious!<//text>

<review>It's right off the highway at a car wash and we could see the line and people cooking which was nice cause we didn't have to guess where it was. I do think they should update the sight letting people know what car wash they're at.  My husband is obsessed with hot fried chicken so we've been to alot of different places. We're waited for our food to be cooked longer than we waited in line but we got there a few mintues after they opened. Having said that the chicken was cooked perfectly, it was delicious and juicy. Not alot of chicken for all the bread I felt like it was a tease,  the pickles were a little salty but I'm not sure if it was the batter or if it was because it was pickles. It was good but I don't think we'll make another hour and a half drive to eat here again. Howlin' Ray's is still at the top of my list even with the wait. My husband just wishes he would've ordered more food.< /review>< Rating>

Okay listen! I just took my son and nephew to LA for Rolling Loud festival. They talked about this place for MONTHS. When the GPS said we had arrived I as a little skeptical because it was at a car wash. Living in Montana we just don’t have street food here, so it as different for me. HOWEVER, LET ME TELL YOU! I’m still craving this place. We rearranged our WHOLE vacation to make sure we got to eat here. The food is the BEST chicken I have ever had in my LIFE! Oh how I wish we had one in Montana.
Listen, rearrange your whole day, week, I don’t care... Eat at this place!!! I had the loaded fries, mild with honey and fried pickles. But I’m sure EVERYTHING is AMAZING!</text>

<date>1562035651458< /date><rate>5< /rate><Text>Very good chicken. I had their two piece and fries combo, which was nicely presented and had a great taste all around. It was crispy, juicy, and pretty authentic Nashville style hot chicken. The fries were also pretty good, although I still prefer the fries at Dave's Hot Chicken in K-Town. They also include a complimentary drink as part of the order. I would definitely go back.

If my son could eat here everyday he would, I would enjoy the food much more if I wasn't so concern about my weight overall the food gets ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ the service is fantastic everyone is very nice so friendly but most of all they get your food out so fast, it's amazing for the big lines they always have.  😉
I just think the food is a bit overpriced. They should give smaller portions so they could lower the price and everyone would be happy. I really think your business, would multiply.   You guys are some good  hot motha ******'* oops! I meant Cluckers. 🐥🐔<//review>

Delicious Fried Chicken.  They serve sandwhiches, sliders, strips, and nuggets, as well as fries.

Choose your spiciness level.  Enjoy fresh there at the tables or take it home.  This has become my go to froe chicken spot in the valley.< /text>

For of all, they are located inside the car wash spot right off the freeway. I passed it twice trying to look for it, lol, google didn't know where I was going.  I got the 2 chicken sliders meal, with clucked up spice. It was good and hot. Not as hot as other spots, considering clucked up was their hottest spice. The Cole slaw was ok. In my opinion, it could've used more base and pepper. The fries were overly fried and salty. Not a bad spot to kick back with the squad though. A must try if in the area, if just to say you've been there.<//Review>

<Review>These guys have an amazing set up.  Just watching them produce their tasty chicken, assembly line style, is fun.  The chicken is all that and more, so darn good.  Choose your heat, it comes like fire if you want it that way or get mild for Mom.  I wish they had either more seats or a shop because there's only 2 small picnic tables.  Or bring an suv and eat out of the trunk, old school style.  Either way, 5 enthusiastic stars.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>So I drove all the way to Sherman Oaks to get this chicken and we drove by it as I'm sure many have. It's in the parking lot of a car wash and they are only open certain days. Sadly the wait was horrible - over an hour but the food was SO good and the prices are great. For ten bucks you get a sandwich and lots of french fries. They even snuck in an extra spicy tender, but my friends didn't get one so think that was an accident

I would totally drive the 20+ miles to get this again!< /review>< Pictures>

If you are looking for a super delicious fried chicken sandwich that's seasoned to perfection, then Hot Motha Clucker is your kind of place. Located outside of a carwash, this place not only delivers mouthwatering chicken in various spiciness levels and seasonings but also provides very friendly customer service. I've tried almost everything on their menu, but the original chef special is my favorite. I highly recommend them especially for late-night munchies as they're open late.</Text>

I don’t know why this chicken sandwich doesn’t get the same hype as the Popeyes chicken sandwich cuz this was the best chicken sandwich I’ve had in LA next to Howlin Rays. Actually this may be a tie with Howlin Rays and you don’t have to wait for two hours to get it. I will def be back for another sandwich. Please please don’t ever change that recipe k. It’s a keeper. And please add alcohol to the menu soon. I think y’all were waiting for your liquor license when we went but hopefully you have it now. Regardless, I’ll be back soon. 😍</review>

Awesome chicken. Been here 3 times already and still can't get enough of it. I tried the slider combo and the tender combo. I would recommend the tender combo more because it seems like a better deal. The tenders have a great taste and crisp to it, along with some nice fries and pickles. The only thing is be prepared to wait, as it can be up to 30 minutes sometimes, since they cook everything from scratch. I shot a YouTube video on my channel Rockstar Eater if you want to see an overview of the facility and food!</Review>

Ashely was always a amazing coach but it’s not till I joined another F45 due to moving that I really appreciate what a WONDERFUL coach she is she so encouraging even so early in the morning she’s pushes you a way where you feel so positive! All of her feed back and comment just put me in a good mood for a work out! She really is a spectacular coach and I encourage anyone to join everyone of her classes!</review>

Staff is very friendly, and Coach Nathan is always pushing you and providing great energy throughout your whole workout! Working out used to be a chore for me, and now I'm always excited to go to an F45 class. Definitely a great place to meet new people and have fun working out.</Text>

I came to try out a class and it was so amazing!! The community is really welcoming and the front desk girls and coaches make sure to listen to you & any goals or needs you may have. They also have events that really helped me become a part of the community here. I 1000% recommend!< /Text>

Thanks for helping me lose 8 lbs, increase muscle mass by 5lbs and decrease body fat by 10% during my time here [2 months] ! Brock, Luke  Nathan, Meg, Meghan and all the coaches here are the best!!! Luke also hooked me up with meal service Maple Blue which I love! Exercise and nutrition go hand in hand.< /review>

Tried to start my professional fitness journey here as I loved the initial atmosphere and layout. They seemed very excited to have me there! After about a week the head coach went MIA, and a coach bullied me out of trying to reach out to them by repeatedly having me removed. Some of the coaches and people here make it worth it but I can't get past how sneaky it felt to be made into a sales pitch.< /Review>

<Review>The energy at this F45 studio is contagious - and that's ALWAYS a good thing!! I've been coming to the Hillcrest location for over a year & I'm also one of the DJs for Saturday classes - the vibe that this place has is second to none (from the owners to the members). I've been to several other F45 studios in SD, and the trainers here are just on a different level; whereas other places may tell you to go "faster faster!" to get as many reps in & get your heart rate up, here the focus is on quality, not quantity - they help the clients, no matter their level of fitness, maintain good form throughout the set and suggest any modifications as needed. This is really important, especially in a group setting. The workouts are always intense - I've been doing F45 since June 2017, and they never get easier. It's good to see the trainers always challenge even the more advanced members. They are also very passionate about the program, and that's evident from the enthusiasm they bring to the classes. The studio also hosts various social events throughout the year such as beach workouts and comedy nights which help to keep the feel of a strong community.

Nowadays with COVID, the studio has done a phenomenal job with making the necessary modifications to maintain social distancing and cleanliness (it has always been clean!). We are all spaced at least 6 feet apart and have all the equipment we need in our tile, so no rotating/sharing equipment which was the case pre-COVID. Cleaning solution is also at each tile, and we all clean our equipment thoroughly at the end of the class. The trainers will then do another cleaning immediately after and before the next class. I have zero hesitation coming here during these current times.

Yes, I'd highly recommend this studio to anyone looking for a group training setting. I could have asked to DJ at several other F45 studios in SD, but from their social media content I knew the Hillcrest location was a step above the rest. I believe the studio is the largest F45 in the city - another perk to consider!

**Note - the DJ pics are pre-COVID - as mentioned above, everyone works out in their own square tile now.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZnt06y1FZKVR4yKMM6Rn9pOnzSqOREm-AuoIQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPG7YQw2T8gm4vCJeIayNuzkSB07BRW0uKOY6vx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOcCok_Pp36hfvPSkgDXt98ofQ2Ksu0YdbEMyns=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

Brock runs the East Hillcrest location and truly makes the clientele feel at home. He warmly welcomes me every time I come in to class. He pushes me harder than I’ve been able to push myself. Meagan Barnaba is also such a great coach! Thank you both for helping keep my mind and body in shape.</review>

I joined in August of 2018.  Two years and over 400+ classes and counting, F45 has been instrumental in my overall health and well being.  Since joining, I have hit my goal weight and now have a new goal weight.  I have gone from 25% body fat to 10.5% during that time which helped me get my cholesterol levels and blood pressure in check.  I am forever grateful to the studio and the entire coaching staff that pushed me to my limits and putting up with this almost old guy telling them to leave me alone.  #HillcrestDaddy loves me some F45.<//Text>

I LOVE F45 Hillcrest! I’ve tried several different workout classes and this is my favorite. The trainers are sooo full of energy and positivity. They know your strengths and weakness and work with you to get to your fitness goal. They also focus on your form and recovery to prevent any injuries. It’s the fitness community I was looking for. PLUS they are very clean. All the equipment is cleaned after every class. :)<//text>

This is the best F45 I've been to! Moving over from Australia and looking for a F45 in SD, the space that F45 East Hillcrest has with the super high ceilings and floor space, makes it very comfortable to work out in.
The energy of the trainers, staff  and other clients are always high and positive!

There is now even an Outdoor space in their back parking lot to do workouts in the open air during this pandemic!

All their trainers (Meagan B, Brocky D, Megan R and Mat) and staff also show a vested interest in your fitness and progress.</review>

<review>GREAT PLACE TO BE. My cousin and i came all the way from Spokane Washington. The vibes were unreal. We were welcomed by amazing staff and owner. There was no judgement and they encouraged us to push ourselves to our best potential! If you are in the area, hit this amazing gym, you won’t be sorry! Hoping to be back soon!< /review>< gmapID>

<Review>This studio has THE BEST conditioning classes in San Diego! I've tried other locations but ultimately I decided to join East Hillcrest because the classes are phenomenal - I was sold after one class haha. The studio is large and spacious, the bathroom is beautiful, and you also get a ton of perks being a member here. Brock makes sure to hook us up with all kinds of swag and discounts and the fellow members here are awesome. A big sense of community at this gym along with lots of events provided outside of the studio. So happy I found my new fitness home!< /Review></record>

<Review>I’ve been training at F45 for a little over a year now, and while I have been to other studios/gyms this one is has by far become my favorite! Some of the best parts about this studio is the team training technique (for those athletes out there), they’re classes rather than open gym, ultimately eliminating the brain work to plan my workouts and change them periodically, and it’s only 45 minutes! You really can’t go wrong. The trainers are knowledgeable and energetic and i always look forward to going back every morning (sometimes multiple times a day). The workouts themselves are challenging, yet anyone can do them with or without modifications. This is certainly a “functional” gym and since getting into my routine with F45 I have become noticeably stronger, leaner and have found my happy place! Highly recommend trying it out for yourself if you want to change your life!!</Review>< GmapID>

<Text>I have tried other locations, but I LOVE this location. It is always pretty easy to find parking, the facility is clean, and the coaches are phenomenal! Highly motivating and it is one of the few workout classes that I have found that keeps be going 6 days a week! Its great to get such a high intense workout done in 45 minutes so I can get in and get out fast and head to work. Taylor and Brock are amazing and can't wait to start my 8 week challenge next week.</Text><response>None<//response>< Rate>

F45 Training East Hillcrest is more than just a gym to exercise functionally for 45 mins. It is a space that encourages the 'I'm possible', surrounded by like-minded people that force one to level up without one realizing; specifically F45 Training East Hillcrest is like no other fitness studio. It's a kind of magic!

What really caught my attention was their 8-week wellness challenge. There is no other word to describe it except wholesome.  So far I am five weeks into it and I've started to see a change in my physic in less than three, however more so I noticed a change in my mindset, which is priceless.

Thank you, everyone, at F45 Training East Hillcrest for making my experience life-altering. My gratitude for you runs deep.

*F45 Training East Hillcrest: 10/10 friendly, clean, motivating, and functional (meaning; anyone willing CAN do the exercises). Just go for it!</review>

After visiting several F45 studios in the area, this one is by far the best one! It’s large, clean, tons of window lighting, and their bathroom and showers are super nice!

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun, HIIT style training! Everyone is super nice and inviting.<//text>

Started with Hillcrest F45 gym on day 1 when it opened a year ago.  It's a great facility, the program is challenging but not impossible (HIIT for 45 minutes each class)...some days can really kick your butt but you feel great afterwards, the results come when you follow the program and the coach staff (lead by Brock) are very welcoming, not intimidating at all.  It's been a great place to workout!<//Review>

I visited San Diego for vacation last week and a friend recommended F45 since I have a history of Crossfit and Orangetheory so this was a great combination of the two. The facility was really clean, it included showers, bathrooms, and a really nice area to get ready with blowdryers, straighteners, etc! I was really impressed. The two coaches were really engaging and did a great job making sure everyone's form was in check. Thanks again for your hospitality!<//text>

F45 is the best gym, fitness exercise class in San Diego. The boys (Brock, Evan, and Luke) are the best. Their team is outstanding. I attend the 5am or 6am classes and they rock! The classes are a functional tabata style. Love the cardio-metabolic aspect of the classes. DEFINITELY recommend this gym. #justdoit< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>F45 is the best workout I've ever done. My body has completely transformed since starting this workout without much change in my diet. Evan, Jason, Brock, Steph, Stevie, Jonny & Mariella are some of the trainers at the Hillcrest and La Jolla studio who really push me to get me in the best shape- strong and lean. They know your name when you walk through the door, they pay attention to your form and they genuinely want to help you succeed and reach your fitness goals. This workout is so addicting and the time in class flies by because there is never one day where the workout is the same. I highly recommend the trainers at these two studios!<//Text></record>

These guys know what they are doing and they are all so personable and friendly.😀 Quality coffee and baristas. My favorites are- Gibraltar, Flat White, Havana Latte, London Fog, and their Chai (perfect balance of sweet and spicy).

Love the Breky sandwich as far as food goes! Hands down the best gourmet breakfast sandwich in the bay!!!</text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1614731537477, 'text': 'Thank you for the review, glad you are enjoying some of our offerings.'}<//response>< gmapID>

Ordered the Havana Latte, Lemon Curd Tart, and Apple Cheesecake after some bike riding along the Bay Trail. Really friendly staff and overall nice atmosphere. I really enjoy seeing the art displayed throughout the cafe. The Havana Latte itself was really enjoyable and just the right amount of sweetness I enjoy. The desserts were also very good. Shoutout to Cakes by Karl in Vallejo, who I believe supplies East Bay Coffee with these pastries/desserts!< /review>

An excellent local coffee joint. The music was not overbearing and temperature was comfortable.  My only complaint has always been the stools. Something about them is wrong enough (height or seat maybe) size for me personally to be uncomfortable. Many younger 20 somethings seemed just fine however. So when I need to sit and get some work done I look for an actual chair rather than the stools<//Text>

Absolutely love this place. EBC has quickly become one of my top favorite coffee stops in the Bay. The house-made simple syrups aren’t simple at all- they’re unique and wonderfully crafted. Balanced taste every time with very non-basic and delicious flavors. I never have to ask for “half sweet” like with most of the streamlined cafes. Another interesting detail is that their lattes are always served at perfect drinking temperature - I don’t know how they do it! Great amount of froth and cream art, but never scaldingly hot. It’s such a thoughtful detail. Live music on weekends, and great beer selection on tap for a good evening. Quick tip: if you’re a first timer, tell them! They’ll graciously give you your next drink free!<//Review>

<rating>4< /rating><text>The coffee was okay. The prices were good. The space is pretty (loved the artwork!!) but it was also kind of dirty, which was disappointing. Tables covered in crumbs. The floor covered in crumbs. Tables were wobbly and required napkins to make even. Outlets weren’t the easiest to get to. But they have a committed customer base who come regardless. Very diverse crowd. The manager or owner (not sure which) was very friendly and she seems to be on a first name basis with many people which was impressive. She was also very kind to her employees, which was nice to see her interact with them so positively. I will go again to give it another shot, but I hope it’s cleaner because I hate sitting in other people’s crumbs. They should invest in a broom/mop. Maybe it was an off day?<//text>< Pics>

The coffee was good,  and the overall layout was really nice.  With that said, the store seems to be catering to the "coffee house" crowd, but  the whole place was very dirty with crumbs and dust everywhere in the dining area, tables etc. The restroom was not clean and I would have expected it to be cleaner since it just opened. One other thing I witnessed was the skinny guy making the coffee seemed frustrated and he was speaking down to the customers that were waiting for their coffee. I understand he was busy, but he should not speak or snap at the people shopping at his store.  Maybe a third person should be working on a busy Sunday morning to help out.

After my visit I picked up my friend from around the corner and just took her to Starbucks down the street. Next time I visit, I will try this place again, hopefully it will be a little better.< /Review><user_name>dno702< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

I came here a while back, and I remember it being good; but I came today and holy mother of god I forgot how amazing it is. Like, they manage to perfectly preserve the bold flavor of the coffee AND have it sweetened at the same time. I don't even really know how to describe it in a helpful way. You're just gonna have to try it for yourself.

P.S. I recommend the Iced Caramel Latte (to die for)< /text>

Love this place!

I come here pretty regularly. Almost every Monday and whenever I have extra time to do some work or maybe just pick up a coffee.

They're Guatemalan and the other one I unfortunately cannot remember was really good.

Lattes are good. Not much caffeine if that's what your looking for. The Gibraltar had a strong taste but seemed to do there caffeine job for a a bit longer.

When it comes to follow, there cookies, quiche, and scones were really good. Their mini bus could use some work. They were a little too squishy for my taste.
Customer service is great! Any questions you have they will answer them for you with no problem at all. I didn't know a lot of their drinks but they were good at assisting me.<//Text>

In my humble opinion, It can be a get away or an Oasis for some and for others its just a coffee shop. Just come relax and enjoy. Your experience will be what it will be. I enjoy Open Mic-Nite on Thursdays at 7pm. Great entertainment. I enjoy East Bay Coffee House.

East Bay Coffee is the best place to get a good cup of coffee in Pinole. They also offer a nice range of foods and other drinks. The space is great of working or meeting with friends.<//Text>

<review>Really cute place. Great place to sit and get work done. But four stars because I was super excited about finding a third wave coffee place near where I live but didn't find the coffee to be very good. I had a latte and it tasted watery. That was definitely a first for me. Usually it's either too milky or too bitter but this one was definitely watery.< /review>< Pics>

There's so much space but it's not too overwhelming.  The people are nice and the coffee is yum.  It's really comfortable hanging there with a friend and cup of coffee/tea.  I haven't eaten food here, but I like their dirty chai.<//Text>

<Time>1441003727690<//Time><rate>5</rate><Review>Sometimes you only have to go a place once to know how great it is and Easy Bay Coffee Co meets those exceptions. Located on a quiet corner in Pinole, East Bay Coffee is more than a coffee shop but also a place which holds weekly events: Open Mic on Thursday, Board Game Wednesdays, and Worship on Sundays.

There is not a lot of parking provided from the shop, however there is plenty of parking nearby and across the street. As I walked into the place you immediately get a relax and friendly vibe. There is plenty of seating and limited outlets. It's a great place to study or have a quiet chat with a friend.

As for the coffee (I.E. vanilla latte) it was refreshing and packed with caffeine because I was wired the rest of the night and the cheesecake was mind-blowing delicious; the price for all of this was $10. The pricing is a little high, I think it's worth it. The service is also great, very friendly. I understand why this place gets so many visitors and is beloved by the locals. East Bay Coffee Co is your go-to alternative coffee shop when you want to experience coffee in a home-like atmosphere.<//Review>< Pics>

Easily the best coffee, and cafe spot in the area. Worth a visit! My only issue is that it is too popular on the weekends. Gets crowded, and the wait time goes up, with only one barista. Maybe expand! :)< /Review>

We got lucky because we got a seat for 2 where we had a good enough view of the performers.  Some performers were good, others were not good at all.  It was a good experience.  I would go back here for another open mike day, or just drinks and pastries.<//text><user_name>Ocampo Family Wellness< /user_name><user_id>115230188247839398406<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

The guy that takes orders there is beyond rude. I asked him how his day was before I placed my order and he responded “with what do you want!” and was impatient. There’s too many options in the area to come here again.

Their drinks are average and  overpriced.<//Text>

Coffee was gross! You aren't even aloud to order how you like it! Asked for 1 shot of espresso, nope only comes as double, wanted whipped cream on the 2 drink (even offered to pay extra) NOPE wouldn't add whipped cream because the owner doesn't want whipped cream on espresso based drinks! Guess it doesn't go with their hipster brand! This place sucked, save your money!<//review>

A total gem amongst ordinary stones is how I would describe this place.  It's  quite clear to see they have constructed much more than a great cafe.  It is a focal point for the community as well.  You can count on solid coffee and food, friendly and prompt service along with super cool vibes.</Review>

<Review>I'm an outside observer to the current sexual harassment case at EBCC. I've just moved here from the East Coast and can't speak to what's going on, or why. However, I can promise that anyone who visits here will be greeted by a very friendly staff, and have a truly delicious cup of coffee. Their bacon egg muffin is both intriguing and delightful, if you are a meat eater. If not, there are plenty of other tasty pastries to indulge your tastebuds.<//Review><rate>5</rate><date>1529262640349< /date><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Love their macchiato, love the atmosphere more. EBC is a great place to study or work. Even when theres a lot of people, it's usually a mindful crowd.  Their commitment to sustainability / local offer up a break from big-box brands and plastic cups. The macroons they serve are delicious too!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x808576e0a447ccf7:0x373b3e418ba6c032</Gmap_id>< Name>

Is "YES" enough of a review?

Imagine our surprise when we showed up from San Francisco for a soccer game to find East Bay Coffee open and ready to go! So excited.

The staff were really friendly and seems like folks who were local and knew their coffee.

I tried the Iced Nitro brew and it was AWESOME.

The space was nice and open with tables to sit. It is in the community center so there is constant movement of kids and families.

While we don't find ourselves out there all that often, I know if that field shows up on our schedule, we will be excited!</Text>

Nice neighborhood coffee place to chill. Yummy pastries, though a bit limited. They are going to put an outdoor patio, and hopefully the lot next door will be obtained for overflow parking.< /text>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>It's a great local spot, the staff can get a little loud at times. During the evening it gets loud often and the music that they play on the background can get a little loud and make you feel sleepy.

The coffee and pastries are delicious and that's why it gets three stars but the other factors of being able to stay there and do work need to be improved. This isn't supposed to be a go in get your coffee and go out shop, it's actually a place you're supposed to stay and enjoy.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

Spacious little cafe tucked away on the side of San Pablo Ave in Old Pinole. Very comfortable feel with good coffee and nitro cold brew. Good place to study or hang out and doesn't get super loud. Internet gets spotty sometimes but Still decent.</text>

I love this place because this place is so welcoming. From the service they give to the people you meet in this place. I met my fiancé there! Coffee is GREAT! They give extra love with their coffee. My favorite coffee is the Nitro Cold Brew. Every now and then they have live music so that is very unique for a coffee place< /text>

Bad: don't have light roast and stopped serving the quiche.  Good:  Everything else.  great staff; nice set up; good espresso drinks and teas.  available food is good.  has wifi.  [p.s. tiny bit pricey.  after tip, it's like $5 for a cup of very roasted coffee...!]<//Text>

<review>Came in for a nice sit-down coffee/breakfast with my friend. Loved the atmosphere right off the bat. Comfy seating and really fun art on the walls from a local artist. Service was great. Woman behind the counter was friendly and helped us with our food and beverage related questions. The Havana was delicious! My friend got a latte with an extra shot, super good as well. For food she got the Acai Bowl which looked fresh and was described as subtlety sweet and feeling like you were eating real food. I got the bacon and egg muffins and wow! It was delicious! Exactly what I wanted/was hoping for in a quick but hearty breakfast. And they give you some insaely good peach salsa? It almost feels like it should be spicey...but but it's not absolutely delicious with the muffin. Overall the East Bay Coffee Co. Is a total win for Pinole, CA. As an outsider, it's one of the places I will go home and tell my friends about. 10/10 experience. I really wish I had taken pics for you guys sorry. Next time I'm in town!<//review><Gmap_id>0x808576e0a447ccf7:0x373b3e418ba6c032<//Gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

The coffee is very good, they do the latte art with foam here, my only wish was that they had a bigger variety with their flavored coffee, it's very basic here. Chocolate, vanilla, caramel are it really.<//Text>

Free WiFi, two bathrooms, tasty pastries, some good coffees, and fun seasonal coffees.

They use single origin coffees, but there's not much variety. Choice of two cold pressed iced coffees, a dark (Sumatra) roast or a blend (East Bay). The hot coffee comes in either a dark (Sumatra) or medium (Guatamala) roast. No fresh made iced coffee with light roast available. No cold brew.

For my tastes they don't seem to offer coffee I love: single origin light roast in either iced or cold brew. BUT, they offer pour over Ethiopian coffee on weekends, which is up my alley.<//Text>

<Review>For being a coffee shop, their coffee is terrible. And the staff not very friendly on any my visits. On one visit, the young guy behind the counter didn't say one word to me, from start to finish, when ordering my coffee. Not "Hi, how are you?", not "What can I get for you?" not "thank you, have a good day"!!!! Just there punching a timecard I guess. But not to bash on the place too much, I will say they do have a great open mic night. Very crowded (VERY young crowd) but some very talented people, good atmosphere and was very enjoyable.< /Review><username>Michael Jordan<//username><Rating>2</Rating></record>

Is corporate coffee more tasty? Sometimes. However, I've carefully watched the staff (mostly locals / kids ALL so nice) prepare beverages and food. It's ALL fresh and real! No weird premade plastic bags of formula dispensed with corporate precision into a branded cup. So yeah I come back time after time for the unique items, homemade family recipes and AWESOME kind and sincere staff time after time. A REAL GEM in Pinole. Beautiful art, welcoming space and wonderful community vibe amongst the patrons make East Bay Coffee my favorite stop to get caffeinated!< /text>

Bill And Lisa were extremely rude I asked questions about the menu and gave me a bad attitude. I ordered what I needed but afterwards they kept giving me a dirty look... maybe because I was the only Hispanic in the place? They treated everyone else better. I showed up on a Sunday while they were having "worship night" but I kept hearing mason-like terminology being used and someone joked about "white supremacy." Definitely never coming back here in my life with my kids or nephews and nieces and I don't recommend anyone else to come here..< /Review>

Nice quaint space that you can enjoy nice beverage and work on homework. Staff is friendly and professional. I  wish the capcity is bigger, more options to plug in your devices, did not like that my Wi-Fi signal was consistent. I lost my connection several times. Other than that issue. I would definitely come again when given the opportunity.< /Review>

East Bay Coffee is Bang Tidy!

Great coffee! Truly great coffee, crafted and created each and every time! The folks behind the counter always make sure you feel very welcome as you walk in the door too. There is a very nice selection of pastries and other baked goodies to add a little something extra with your coffee. Great venue for a change of scenery for your study time...  Great place to meet friends and definitely the place to be on a Friday night to experience Bistro Rex performing live on stage.  Yes indeedy, we are very lucky to have East Bay Coffee situated right here in Pinole. I look forward to going each and every time !

One more thing.  If you're an expat this next bit is important. You can get a nice cup of PG at EBC  !

This is the chill coffee shop everyone's been waiting for. Plenty of options on drinks, pastries, and snacks to satisfy anyone's palate. Weekends are obviously the busiest times, sometimes making it a free-for-all to find good seats and tables. Like any decent coffee shop should provide, there is also good WiFi and plenty of wall outlets. Need a place to hang and kill sometime, chat with some friends, do some work, or grab a snack? This place will do you right. Lastly, staff are attentive and friendly.<//Text>

It's very noisy and often times the jazz music is cloying. But, it seems like it has a loyal fanbase. And their dirty chai is a must have. I've heard rumors about an acai fruit bowl, but it's certainly not on the menu.< /Text>< Pics>

We have been coming here since EBCC opened. My daughter recognizes all the awesome staff, since she's basically seen them her whole life. The ambience of EBCC is perfect for fostering a child's ability to order and pay for an order: quiet attention, small town feel, wonderfully caring baristas, with excellent attention to details (like the teddy bear foam picture on the kids hot chocolate).

But it's also amazing for adults! Fresh, delicious, caffeinated beverages. Scrumptious pasteries line the case, including a wonderful chocolate mousse that absolutely hits the spot when I've had a long day with a strong willed child.

They have open mic night, a worship service, and a ukulele play along based lesson. There is so much good stuff going on at EBCC. I hope they are here for many years.<//Text>

< review>
East Bay Coffee House or East Bay Coffee Company is a new edition to Pinole, California.  Pinole, a charming; valley community is the East Bay's best kept secret.

East Bay Coffee House offers its customers a very spacious area (for California) to enjoy their coffees and focus on studying, work, reading,etc.

East Bay Coffee offers Open Mic on Thursdays and for performers who bring their A game to the table, the Coffee House offers an excellent PA / Sound System.  Starbucks and Peets in Pinole are both very small and they do not offer live music.  East Bay Coffee House is Pinole's #1 Coffee Shop!<//review>

I’ve studied here for two months! It was brainstorming lessons that I’ve ever had! My teacher’s name was Hamid. He has done a great job of preparing students for graduate school. Recommend everyone who wants to be involved in the educational environment!<//Review>

<Review>ELS Santa Monica has one of the most professional staff I've ever worked with. They're always prompt in responding to my inquiries and they are very friendly. Their center is welcoming and always clean as well. Overall, I'm very satisfied in my working relationship with them and I'd recommend their center to any ESL instructor looking to advance their career in the field!</Review>< date>

<Review>I recommended from my mother this place. The first class was so nervous, but I made friends with people from various countries. It is really nice to tell teacher as soon as if I don't understand. If you take the test properly, you will understand. I took 4 hour(until 12:35), I can go to sightseeing.It is fun to talk with classmate using English and I learned  a lot of new things.<//Review>< Pictures>

Having worked with ELS from Central Admissions in New Jersey for over 13 years, working with our Santa Monica team has always been a pleasure. They are incredibly responsive, flexible, and helpful.  It makes my job so much easier!  Plus, having visited Santa Monica, the center is in a fantastic location! So students benefit not only from the devoted staff, but also from an exciting location with lots of events and activities in the surrounding area! Thank you ELS Santa Monica for constant support!</text>

<Review>The ELS Santa Monica center is in a fantastic location right on the promenade and just steps away from the famous Santa Monica Pier and Pacific Ocean.  On top of studying in such a vibrant area, students can expect to be extremely supported by each ELS staff member.  The staff at ELS Santa Monica ensures each student has the best experience possible – both inside and outside the classroom!</Review>< Pictures>

A great school to learn and meet wonderful people. Every month is based on a specific subject (Economy, biology, humanity...) so learning is double :) It's also located in the best place of Santa Monica, close to shops, restaurants and most important: close to the beach!
Wonderful teachers and workers, you won't regret being there!<//review>

ELS Santa Monica is good enough to learn English and it is very social place to make friends.For example, I have met many foreign students and I have strong relationship with them.  Also teachers are friendly and polite. I won't forget them. We are like family in this school. I want to study at ELS again.<//review>< Pics>

As the former A.D of the Hollywood center, all I can say is that I had the best experience working with the Santa Monica center. Rosanna Islas, the Center Director, is one of the best professionals I have ever worked with. Rosanna and her staff (Pablo, Michelle, Sianny, Stephanie, Mary...) are amazing professionals always willing to assist students and coworkers. The staff at this center works really hard to make sure students have the best learning experience in the U.S. They are very professional, kind, and motivated! I do miss working with such amazing folks! Anyone who sends their kids to study at the Santa Monica Center will allow them to have a memorable experience  for life... for sure!!!< /Text>

ELS Santa Monica is located in downtown Santa Monica, next to the artists, theaters, shops, and open-air restaurants of the Santa Monica Promenade. The city is famous for its palm tree-lined walkways, breathtaking sunsets, mild climate, and friendly atmosphere. Visit the famous Santa Monica Pier, or enjoy outdoor sports like surfing, skateboarding, biking, and swimming.<//review>

(Translated by Google) In my opinion, ELS SM one of the best English institute in the US, they have different English programs which meet your future target. Also, ELS Santa Monica has a nice aquiflied staff and teachers. Highly recommended!

In my opinion, ILS is one of the most misguided institutes in America, they have different programs suited to your future goals, and also the staff and teachers are very qualified and respected. I advise students to speak English!

في رأيي، إي ال اس واحد من الضل المعاهد في امريكا، لديهم برامج مختلفة تناسب اهدافك المستقبلية ، وايضا الموظفين والمدرسين مؤهلين ومحترمين جدا. انصح فيه للدارسين لغة انجليزية!< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I have had the least experience (wonderful), the institute is more than wonderful, the staff are united, cooperative and qualified.

The diversity of students from different countries of the world a positive point to register the Institute in addition to the abundance of programs at different levels and hours that meet the objectives of different students.

It is also worth mentioning the place of the pivotal institute for Santa Monica.

I have had a wonderful experience, the teachers are qualified and cooperative as well as all the staff.

There are students from different countries around the world which can help you to practice without using your first language, in addition, you can learn more about new cultures.

The school located in 3rd Street, the most popular street in Santa Monica and near to The Pier.

If I had the chance to study English again in the US, I would study in the same school.

حضيت بتجربة أقل ما يقال عنها ( رائعة ) ، معهد أكثر من رائع ، طاقم عمل متكاتف ومتعاون ومؤهل.

تنوع الطلاب من مختلف دول العالم نقطة إيجابية تسجل للمعهد علاوة على ذلك وفرة البرامج بمختلف المستويات والساعات والتي تلبي أهداف الطلاب المختلفة.

من الجدير بالذكر أيضًا مكان المعهد المحوري بالنسبة لسانتا مونيكا.

<Review>My experience was very pleasant.  Not sure who helped me today evening with my battery replacement but thinking he was the owner of Fast Fix at Century City. Very happy with my service with him.

Actually, < a year ago I went to the Fast Fix in Santa Anita mall to replace my battery but within a couple weeks the battery died.  So at that point I was a bit discouraged and just ended up forgetting about it.  Then today thought of trying my luck at the Century City Fast Fix.  I didn’t realize I had a 1-year warranty from before and was ready to pay at the time when I was picking up the watch but he reminded/surprised me that the battery replacement was free because I had the 1-year warranty.  So the replacement was free. He could have easily charged me and I would have paid not realizing the past warranty but he was honest. I will definitely be a customer for life.

Hope his business flourishes! 😁< /Review>< pictures>

I came here to clean some rings. Really significant rings. My mother’s wedding bands and beautiful diamond ring my father purchased her over 30 years ago. Fast-Fix did an incredible job, were nothing but honest (they replaced some prongs too), and my rings are now extra beautiful and sparkly. When I look at them, I think of my mother, which puts a smile on my face. Thank you, Fast-Fix!</Review>

These people are so nice and for reasonable prices. I've been her a few times and the jobs are great. I am so happy to find jewelers who are nice, honest and care about making their customers happy. I highly recommend Fast-Fix !!</text>

<Review>I was overcharged. I looked up the prices elsewhere and I paid more than double the price that others list. Gave two stars because they were friendly, convenient, and the work was acceptable.</Review>< pics>

<text>Great service and fast repair. I brought two watches here, one needing a new wrist band and the other needing a battery. They took my phone  number and texted me when my watches were ready so I could continue shopping at Westfield Century City- what a beautiful shopping destination!< /text>< pics>

<review>I’m happy with the turquoise necklace
repair (although I’d remembered it as
being longer).  As for the.chain the
Clasp is perfect; but I wish you might
have suggested a different chain &
shown my friend some samples &
prices, which I will do next time I’m there.

Francisco repaired my broken sunglasses seamlessly! A small panel was missing / had fallen off from the front frame, and he was somehow able to find an exact replica to replace it with. The right arm (temple) of the glasses had completely unhinged, and he reattached it perfectly. Definitely thought they were beyond repair, so was very pleasantly surprised!! Thanks guys! :)<//Text>

These guys are the best. After taking my broken watchband to a couple other stores repeatedly, only  to have it break again. Granted, it is  a tricky, intricate watch band. But when I took it to Fast Fix they repaired it permanently! They also recommended I get the extended warranty on new battery for my watch, which they just honored and replace for free a few years later. These are a good folks with old school customer service values. I give them my highest recommendation.< /text>

Found my new fave Jewelry service! This location is as upscale in service as any regular high-end jewelry store; you'd never know from its small appearance.  They did such a nice quick job on my bracelet. Now I'm looking for more pieces to fix there. Thanks Fast-Fix Century City!</Text>

Such a great service they provide. 5 years of free battery replacements for a fraction more than the cost of a single battery replacement. Also, I was told it would take 20 minutes and it took 10!< /text>

This place honestly exceeded my expectations. The staff was friendly and super informative about my watch I brought. The watch battery replacement was cheaper than the quote I was given via email (also very impressed by the prompt response as well). It’s a little tucked in at the back of the mall, but that’s my only complaint.< /text>

<Review>Wonderful experience from beginning to end! Paul and Fiona were friendly and great working within my budget and not pressuring me to go over what I was comfortable spending. I bought a beautiful engagement ring that my fiancé loves that appraises for a lot more than I bought it for!

Basically, I'll never buy jewelry from anywhere else again. Enjoyable experience! Thanks Paul and Fiona!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

Amazing experience I have ever had! I know these guys for five years now and they are  truly awesome! Anytime anything happens to my jewelry/watches I go straight to them and always have the best experience because they are not only professionals but also friendly. They do what they say/promise and right on time. I have never gone anywhere else since I met them and never will. I hope they stay in this business forever :)<//Text>

On 12-28-20 I dropped off a 500USD watch for a watch repair service to fix battery issue. Picked it up on 1-4-21 with a warranty period on their repair service.  Watch was not fixed adequately with the alarm sound broken and date function broken as well.  Returned 2-27-21 within the warranty period to fix the watch after they broke it in their original battery replacement service and they broke it even further while it was in their care again.  Watch is now completely inoperable due to their second 'repair' service and they have refused any compensation for their negligence.<//text>< time>

< Review>
The gentleman that works there is very kind and works quickly. I brought in two watches; one for a battery replacement and one for the band to be resized. I had asked him to remove 5 links from my watch and he did. However that was my mistake, the watch was too tight. So I brought it back and he was kind enough to make the adjustment and place one of the links back on. He made sure my watch fit to my liking, rather then scooting me out the door. I am very happy with his work.<//Review>

Francisco was excellent!! He quoted me an hour to fix my broken necklace and he had it ready for me in 20 minutes. This is the second time I’ve come to this location for a repair and I am leaving happily once again. Thank you for such great service!!< /Review>

This shop is a gem, pun intended, and a real lifesaver! Francisco is a true gentleman of his word. He fixed my precious Murano pendants that same day, and was cheerful and serene both times when I was in the shop. One gets the feeling that he doesn’t just know his job, he enjoys it, as well. You don’t get the feeling as you do in other places that a repair is beneath him, that it’s Harry Winston or nothing. Give yourself peace of mind and take your jewelry to Fast Fix!<//Text>

I went with the 5 year warranty on 2 watches and the cheap watch I just did a year.  When I went back in less than an hour to check on them, they were ready with the correct time on them and I also found out 1 of the batteries was replaced for free b/c it was still under warranty from the last time the battery was placed.  I was so happy to know I didn’t have to pay anything for that one just the 2 watches one with a year and the other with 5 year warranty.  Not only are the fast and good customer service, they are trustworthy.  If made me feel relieved because I know some years had gone by before I replaced the battery that was dead for a while.<//Review></record>

I was at the mall for dinner reservations and noticed my watch had stopped working, luckily as I was coming in I noticed Fast-Fix and walked in to see if they could replace the battery. I was in and out in under 5 minutes with my watch working again! I definitely recommend!!<//Review>

Victor has repaired 2 different vintage watches for me. After about 3 months, one of the watches stopped working again and he repaired it for free. His pricing is very fair, workmanship and customer service are excellent.<//text>

Fast Fix is great! Cesar has been my go to Point person for all jewelry repairs, stone replacement, watch batteries, sizing adjustments and troubleshooting. He is always so patient and answers my long list of questions.  He is sincere, knowledgeable and professional.  I really trust him and Fast Fix.
I wouldn’t go anywhere else or trust my cherished pieces with anybody else.</review>

Fast fix always goes above and beyond. I have had two instances where other places have told me there’s nothing they can do to help.

Fast fix has always come through for me, done a great job, and turns it around very quickly even when I haven’t asked for the job to be expedited!</Text>

Edit:
So a month after getting my chain fixed it broke again while I was getting in for work. This time I bring it in and am helped by a man who tells me that it has been too long since the initial repair and that I would have to pay a discounted fee of $19 to get it fixed. I understand that the window may have gone by but to have me pay once again to just have a jump ring attached just feels kinda silly in my book.</text><resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user>

Fast fix is great. They opened my watch to reassure me that the movement was in good condition and gave it a new band in a matter of minutes. It only costed $23. They were busy it made each customer a priority. For any one with a band to adjust or a movement that needs repair, I highly suggest fast fix.👍< /Review>

Loved that my watch repair is guaranteed until 2022 and paid nothing to get a new battery for my watch today.<//text>

<Text>I dropped my watch off yesterday around 630pm for a battery change. Paid with a man named Caesar. Came back around 8pm and the whole place was closed even tho you’re listed hours says open until 930pm.

I had to make a special trip back to the mall today JUST to pick up my watch. No one seemed to care that I had been inconvenienced AND I had to pay AGAIN because I did not have the receipt.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Fast-Fix in century city mall are very helpful and nice and have reasonable prices.
Watch repairs and battery replacement are done quick and same day. I take all types of watches, from cheap to very expensive watches and they always fix/replace the batteries at reasonable price. Resize the links on wristband as well. Highly recommend this establishment.<//review>< pics>

<text>Wanted $30 to replace watch battery.  Wanted $50 to repair stuck button on watch.  Never bothered to call me to let me know about status of either of these items.  Told me my watch was "old" when I came in to get it back, so I asked the woman if they were in the business of fixing new watches.  Repair guy was never there later in the day so had to talk to non-professional staff.

Go to a mom and pop store where they actually care about service and don't have to pay high-end mall rents they pass on to you.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Fast-Fix is exactly what the name says: they are a reliable, first-rate watch repair shop. Their location on the periphery of the Century City Mall is easy to access from the parking lot adjacent to Gelson’s. Their work is very quick (sometimes less than 30 minutes; rarely more than a few days. Prices are extrordinarily reasonable.<//Text>

Question: “How do you increase the ring size?”  Answer: “We add gold.”  Wedding ring weight before resizing from 4.5 to 5.5: 3.3g; weight after: 3.1g.  Inside of band was visibly thinner.  Every jeweler I’ve ever gone to for resizing has done this.  It’s evident they’re banking the drop or 2 of gold to make extra money on top of what they charge you.  They’re ripe for a journalistic sting operation and exposé.< /text>

< Review>
I brought my glasses to Fast-Fix after the arm had snapped right at the hinge. Not only were they able to fix it, but they were able to make it so that it could still fold in and out. I was afraid that I would have to get an new pair of glasses, but they repaired them in less than half an hour.</Review>

<text>I paid 3 times for the same watch to have links removed and added. The first time was by my husband who had gifted me the watch. The second time I was told that I would be able to come back if it was too tight because I was newly pregnant a few months later but wasn’t sure it would be comfortable. They told me to come back anytime to switch it back. When I came back, though it had been some time, they refused to add another link for me and charged me AGAIN. When I explained what the initial sales person had told me they said he didn’t work there anymore, what kind of business and customer service is that? $30 for a link, not once but 3 times. I will never go back and never recommend them to anyone. I could have had the same service done for $5-10 elsewhere and regret it immensely.< /text><date>1538869813342</date><Name>Amber Jamal< /Name><Pics>None< /Pics>< UserId.>

I was very happy with my experience with Fast Fix jewelry. The service was fast and and reasonable in price. In addition I asked if my battery needed replacing, and they said no. Obviously they could have said yes, and I would never know if the battery really needed replacing or not.</text>

<Text>I find it hard to accept this business charges such widely different prices ($19 to $89) to replace a simple watch battery based solely on the brand of your watch. It is like bringing your car in for a new battery and the cost depends whether it is a Kia, Cadillac or Range Rover!< /Text><gmapID>0x80c2bb8b8914cd5f:0x13b48cf99d6756d8</gmapID></record>

<Text>I was referred to them by Michael Kors and from the minute I walked in, everyone was cordial. From the nice gentleman with the cute hat to the sweet and kind lady who assisted him. I must say thank you to the “angel” who was able to fix my watch and I’m happy to report that as of 5:57 pm tonight, it is still keeping perfect time. #kisses #onelove ♥️😘< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< UserId.>

I found this place to be exorbitantly priced and lacking in know how. I brought in several pieces to be fixed and found they did not know the basic remedies for making a simple repair or fixing repairs that were done incorrectly. The wire wraps were left undone, causing potential problems catching on clothing, a stone in a ring was full of glue or some other substance and a simple jump ring was soldered so badly that it would have separated after a few wearings. I asked that my jewelry be returned as I had no confidence that they could fix it and the repairs were taken apart, the stone removed and my jewelry returned -- at no charge, a grace note. I would suggest avoiding Fast Fix in Century City.<//text>

The store did a good job replacing my watch batteries. That being said, the $30 price for a 1-year battery is absolutely ridiculous. I've never paid more than $15 for a standard battery in my life. Yes, I could have opted not to go through with the services but that would have been very awkward, and frankly, I didn't have the time or patience to find another place to take my watches. Also, the store did not inform me they would be sending a text message with a survey request. Unauthorized use of my personal information is not okay. Will not be returning to this business.</text>

This is my second time at FastFix Century City. I had a silver bracelet repaired and they matched the links to add some length.  Several years ago,  they fixed a tiny pearl that popped off the gold post of an earring and they are still going strong!  Fast and quality. Price is fair given the service< /Review>

<Review>I was here last weekend and had a great experience - fast, easy, simple.

My watch needed a battery and they told me I could get one for $20 and it came with a 5 year guarantee which meant for 5 years I could get as many batteries as I needed and they'd be covered by this guarantee. Nice.

They took my watch, we walked around the mall and 20 minutes later it was ready to pick up. Easy peasy - no fuss, no muss. Plus they were really nice.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

This place is a scam. Took my watch here to change the battery. They told me it would cost $44. I thought that was crazy expensive for just changing the battery, so I said no thanks and took my watch to Montana Clock Shop, where they charged me $14!!! And they did it right then and there, took about 5 minutes. The guy was super nice. He offered to do the work right then, even though I showed up 5 minutes before closing time.</text>

The worst workmanship ever, and no inclination to stand behind their work. I had my pearl necklace restrung at an exorbitant price, and was very disappointed when the necklace broke within 10 months of the restringing. When I returned to the shop, they first denied that they had repaired it. Then, confirming it was in fact their work, they said I had worn it a lot (too much), and that was the reason it broke so soon. I, of course, thought that a necklace would last longer than 10 months if strung properly, but they then informed me that they only had a 30 day warranty. The defensive, and in fact OFFENSIVE attitude of the store clerk (owner?) towards me was unimaginable. I would NEVER return to this store, and I would urge everyone to avoid it.< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Katchek, who fixes jewelry is an absolute gem!  I had a wedding present of a gold chain and pearl candlestick holder that was hopelessly tangled and broken with one of the arms that supported it needing to be resoldered.  He made it look like new, which is the best 30th anniversary present ever.  He is kind and generous in spirit (he said he really liked making it beautiful again for me) and he does excellent work.< /Text>< Pics>

The jewelers at Design are perfectionists and also work obtain exactly what you might have in mind to design while offering a beautiful selection of jewelry.  We have been buying pieces for over 20 years and would never go any where else.</Text>

< response>
{'time': 1558806355314, 'text': 'Timothy , sorry to hear about you battery  going dead after 3 months of replacement.\nThe life line of the battery depends on the type of engine consuming that battery. Different watches consume battery much faster then others, that’s why we offer the 5 year free replacement plan, it is to better serve our customers. Please bring the watch to get a new fresh battery anytime!'}< /response>
