< Review>
Steak and prawn burrito is the best,  and I added 2 fish tacos 🌮  to go along with the meal. Took home to let my family try them. They went back to get their own. They were that good!  My favorite spot.< /Review>

<text>Ordered Steak super burrito. It is ok burrito, but I don’t think I would want to come for it again. The place is clean and friendly. I liked it very much. Salsa bar is pretty limited without chips. You are given a little bag of chips with the order though.</text>< time>

<Text>I got the grilled chicken burrito and it was not at all disappointing. The pico de gallo was very savory, the chicken may have been lightly seasoned but mostly grilled flavoring although it could of used a little more charred flavoring in my opinion. They had several gourmet burritos, a steak and prawns one in particular that I cant wait to go back and try. The atmosphere was pretty standard taqueria, could use a little more unique flare but overall was nice. There was a bathroom and was nice.</Text>< Pictures>

I went to the Burrito Shop on Saturday 12/05/20 and ordered a large Burrito with hamburger meat.  Went into my car and started eating the Burrito.  Sorry to say it was the worst Burrito I've ever ate.  It tasted horrible.  The meat was extremely dry, with very little beans and rice and no other ingredients.
The tortilla was really burnt. Sorry to say, I will never go back again.   Please don't go there< /Review>

Went to the Burrito Shop for the first time in years. The food was as good as I remembered though you could only take out an not dine in. It has been in Castro Valley at least the 30 years I have been. It was called The College Burrito Shop.</Review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>Very disappointed. I ordered a SUPER steak burrito and basically got a regular burrito with hardly any steak in it. I got cilantro rice and it was plain white rice with a few pieces of cilantro. If I pay $10 for a super burrito I expect a super burrito with meat in it. I was given a regular size burrito that was basically vegetarian and had a little steak in it and absolutely no flavor to any of the ingredients in the burrito. Had to reheat the burrito because it was luke warm and the cheese wasn't even melted. Waste of money for sure. Atleast we tried but I will definitely not recommend to anyone looking for quantity or quality burrito was far from fresh. Back to Guadalajara we go. Atleast at Guadalajara they are cheaper and you get what you pay for, quantity and quality mexican food. What confuses me is that I have seen pictures of there burritos and mine looked nothing like what I saw in pictures. I don't know how this burrito shop is still running if this is the type of food they serve.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Parking is difficult for this location. The restaurant is small with a couple of comfy booths. There are usually 2 people working at all times, one cook and one taking orders at the register. Menu isn't extensive, but the food is good.</review>

How on earth does this place have 4 stars? Like this is the worst most unauthentic burritos and tacos on the planet. If you like this place, you're most likely looking for something really bland with no spice or flavor.< /Review>

<Text>I got the chicken and vegetables burrito. Everything tasted fresh and it was definitely not as greasy and heavy as your typical burrito. There is a garlic and lime sauce that I wasn't entirely sold on. There was just something about the flavor that didn't quite come together but it was tasty and filling none the less. Ambiance wise it's a taqueria. I'd definitely come back.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><name>Dana Turner< /name>< time>

<userid>102015338555492021782</userid><Review>Very disappointed...I used to live in the Bay area and was in the area a couple of days ago, we wanted a good burrito and some nachos so we went to the place that used to have the best... Not anymore... Shrimp burrito had 2 shrimps in it, lettuce when I told them no lettuce and cheese when I said no cheese... Nachos didn't have much in the way of toppings and the chips were burnt... Needless to say, when I'm back in Castro Valley, the Burrito Shop will not be one of my stops ever again</Review><GmapID>0x808f92316fa2cd99:0xdf2f8a0896c24ee</GmapID>< username>

Good guacamole.
Good counter service.
Nice salsa bar.

<Review>I called ahead for my order and it was ready ready as soon as I arrived. I purchased several burritos. 2 chicken, 1 steak which everyone liked. I had the garlic and lime shrimp burrito. It was alright. I didn't taste very much garlic or lime, but otherwise it was all good food.<//Review>< pictures>

Friendly and fast service, food is delicious and you get a lot for the price. Their meats are always so moist and flavorful never dry like other places I have gone to. Great place to get Mexican food for a great price!!<//review>

Used to frequent this shop when I lived in CV for many years.  Today I removed the most grissle ever from a steak burrito.  Has this place been sold or are they just going cheap on ingredients?< /review>

The variety of food and unique recipes for, what would otherwise be standard, burritos is not only refreshing, but also delicious.

For anyone in the East Bay, this is where you should be getting your burritos. The staff is fast, responsive, and courteous. While the prices may be higher than others, the food is commensurately better quality than anywhere else I've eaten.</text>

<Text>If you want to take a break from joints like Chipotle then this is the place to pick!

I'd recommend their cancun shrimp burritos (with option of spinach tortillas) that are on special deals on Saturdays only. It comes with a decent amount of chips and would implore selecting a bottle of mexican tamarind soda.

The price may be a bit much, but you do save by choosing the burrito deal of the day there. Also be aware that in the past they have messed up my orders so make sure to double check on your end. Other than that I do come back regardless because the food is good!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This is 100% THE BEST Burrito shop in the Bay Area.  I've gone here many times and also try places in the city and these guys are it!
The prices are always reasonable an the burritos are consistently great, they pack'em with a variety of ingredients to balance out the perfect flavor and the veggies in the food are the freshest I've ever had. You can get a killer good sized burrito for $7-$8 and unlike mexican places in the city that charge $10 a burrito and just talk a big game, these guys actually deliver. The salsa bar is fresh as well. And they don't even charge more if you need an extra side of sour cream.

FYI get the honey chipotle or cajun chicken burrito, and add cheddar, its a bit more but totally worth it!
(Mmmmmmm, I just made myself hungry)<//Text>< response>

Prices are high for a burrito and it is nothing special.  Addition prices beyond the basic burrito seem unnecessary.<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) The price is appropriate to the size of the burritos the problem is the parking is not enough and as soon as the time to wait is not more than 10 minutes for an order of 3 and the taste of the food is a 7 😕 I expected something richer They recommended it because they told me they were mega wow but not really.

<text>Super friendly staff and always willing to help to the best of their knowledge. Seem to have a great selection of pretty much anything you might be needing. To be honest though their wood prices seem to be a little high.< /text><Time>1618787240074<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<review>Today, I was disappointed. Their website said my desired item was in stock. I got there, found that they we're all out; NONE in stock. It gets WORSE: turns out that if it had sold yesterday, their stock order doesn't go in until Monday, then wouldn't actually arrive at store for at least another week after THAT. I'm crushed. That's not good at all. It's $6 cheaper from Amazon, anyway - but still, I like to TRY to keep the money local - but with an inventory replentishment system like THAT, it's more likely that they'll NEVER have what I'm looking for..! 1 - 2 - 3 weeks to get it locally, at a higher price - or, get it tomorrow, cheaper, from Amazon!
This just breaks my heart...< /review></record>

The depth of knowledge those at Woodcraft have at Carpentry was evident from when we spoke on the phone and when i was striving to find the best hand saw for the project I was on. The person who help me didn't tell me exactly what i needed, instead he guided me by giving me the pros and cons of each saw and which one he has used for certain jobs.
It was a great experience and i see way Woodcraft is always held in high regard by Carpenters and Woodworkers.</Text>

I love this store. The lady who attends is awesome. She is very sweet and polite. The same with the older male attendant. Unfortunately the young male kid who works there is the rudest and insolent kid I have ever seen. He almost screams to you
and ignore you<//Text>

I've always wanted to used exotic hardwoods in my woodworking projects. Woodcraft has three largest selection I've ever seen. I'm pretty sure they have absolutely everything you could possibly need for woodworking. And the people that work there have excellent knowledge to share.< /text>

I notice you don't publish negative reviews, how strange. Service is non-existent. 5 trips there, couldn't get anyone to help me. Wasn't like this when Wendy managed the store. I'll buy on-line!<//review>

<review>For your hobbyist needs, Woodcraft has almost everything you'd need. If not, a visit to the Woodcraft website can get you on your way. The staff can answer your questions, no matter how obscure, about their products, and, if you need help figuring out how to create your masterpiece, they can advise you on how to go about it. The tough part may be the location, on Main St., as it can easily be missed. Make sure you plan your drive there carefully, or you may have to make a long trip around Main St, or the roads nearby, to circle back through and get into their parking lot.<//review>< pics>

The moment we stepped in the door, I was sure we were in my husband's own land of enchantment. This store seems to have everything a woodworker could need, whether a pro or a hobbyist. The staff were friendly and helpful, there was coffee available, and a big sweet dog, Maggie,  roamed the store giving out hugs. I am 100% sure we will be regular customers.<//Review>

I am new to woodworking and having a place like this with friendly staff and very helpful and explains how certain tools and products work.

<review>My wife and I first moved to Modesto in 2020 and bought our first home ever with Sung as our agent.  Sung was recommended to us by our workplace.  He was extremely helpful from the beginning to the end of the home-buying process.
When we were looking for houses, Sung was knowledgeable of the different areas of Modesto and different aspects of the house to pay attention to on our tours.  He was always available for questions, even on weekends and nights, which is something much appreciated given our odd work hours.  In fact, there was never a time in which he did not respond within 30 minutes.  He would also get us in to see house right away, which is precious given how fast houses are flying off the market currently.
After we had an offer accepted on a house, he remained very involved in facilitating the closing process, communicating with various parties, and providing valuable advice on renovating our home.   He even helped change our locks for us.
As a first-time home-buyer, we went into this process very anxious and overwhelmed.  We couldn’t have asked for a better agent.   Sung made our home-buying process very smooth and painless from start to finish.   We recommend him to without any reservations.< /review>< pics>

I've personally known Aaron for over 12 years.  He is the consummate professional.  Knows his craft, and can share it in laymen's terms so the "first time home buyer or first time home seller" will understand it.  He is on a mission to help others build wealth.  He is patient, he is kind, and he is caring.  I would trust Aaron to help my adult kids or my 93 year old mom.  He has built a team of like minded individuals who truly care about the people they serve.  Honored to know him - and know you will be too!<//Review>

Kris is absolutely amazing. We worked for an extended period of time to find the “right” home and Kris was there every step of the way. He kept us focused, knew what we would like and what we thought we liked but wouldn’t ultimately fit our needs. I really can’t say even things about how well we appreciated working with him to find our current home. The entire West team did a great job and put in a lot of effort to get us coordinated for buying and selling in the middle of the holidays. Getting full asking on our home was definitely rewarding as well. Aaron has helped us sell two homes and we have been very impressed with his professionalism, honesty and knowledge of the markets. We would say that our multiple transactions have been a successful team effort and the results are greatly appreciated.</Text>

After 18 months of communicating with Kris, I finally made the decision to move to Modesto. While I was contemplating my move, Kris was a huge help in selling my dad's house during a difficult time. When it came time to find a home, Kris listened well and steered me towards properties which would suit my needs. He was always quick to respond to phone calls, texts and emails. He also called to check in on a regular basis. Kris was a great negotiator during a crazy market and helped the transaction proceed as smoothly as possible. It was a happy day when we met at the house for Kris to hand me my keys!! Kris is an awesome agent!! I highly recommended him for your real estate needs!<//review>

Aaron West is a professional, knowledgeable and informative Real Estate Agent who is highly skilled  in local knowledge and process. He adds value in every conversation. I received value as he was educating others on strategies that buyers can use to win in multiple offer situations. Working with Aaron is strategic as he gives his buyers a competitive advantage. Work with Aaron and you will be glad you did!</Text>

Aaron and his team are my "go to" for service in Modesto and the central valley.
His attention to detail and care and professionalism make referring clients to him easy.  Aaron's excellent at following up and he's intuitive when it comes to understanding his clients wants and needs.
You can't do better in Modesto than Aaron's West Experience Real Estate Group.<//review>

Aaron and Chris made us feel like family and that our search for a home was the only one they were looking for. They found us our perfect forever home in just a few weeks.  Chris was there with us every step of the way. The advice and wisdom he offered was invaluable. The open house party after closing was a nice touch. We highly recommend.< /text>

<review>I have been extremely impressed with The West Experience! As a lender, I work with many different agents across the Valley and beyond. What I look for in Real Estate Partners is people who care about people. Who see their job as more than just a paycheck, but a way to help families achieve their goals and set themselves up for a bright future. Every agent I have worked with at The West Experience has shown me this as their core. From large transactions to small, I have witnessed them treat every client with the same respect, care, and dignity. They work hard for their clients and are incredibly motivated. I am always happy when I have transactions with their team!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I found Sung Park on Zillow after viewing a potential home and after reviewing several great reviews and chatting with him, I knew I found my realtor. As a first time home buyer, Sung was with me every step of the way answering any Q's I had with pretty much immediate responses. He's friendly, professional, and made me feel like an important client.  His customer service went above n beyond!  I highly recommend him!<//review>

<Text>RUN find better realtor/group
Recently purchased house (in March 2021) where Damien Wilson was the listing agent. Based upon my experience very unprofessional, untrusted and no ethics. Highlighting some points from my experience if it is useful for any reader and can save you hassles, time and money.
1.	Below is the description posted for this house
The home also features a newly installed AC/Heat unit, garbage disposal, and water heater.
Please check the definition of new maybe I don’t know what is new
New AC/Heat unit – inside unit installed in 2004 when house was built. Condenser outside was changed in 2014. New Water Heater- Installed in 2014
2.	After receiving keys we found 50% of the backyard filled with Dog poop. There was a treasured blue bin with over 100 pounds of Dog poop and surrounded by bugs/smell. Even after following for 4-5 days it was not picked up just excuses (was never picked up). We were told Seller didn’t have access but Security system installer had key to enter into the house WITHOUT our knowledge took away thermostat as seller kept extra key after handing over the house. We didn’t check as every time  dogs was occupying the backyard and didn’t expect someone to leave in that condition< /Text>< pictures>

Aaron West recently provided me with advice regarding my Turlock home. After a thorough assessment of my personal goals and future plans, he maintained a keen awareness of my best interests and recommended to me that I do not sell my home at this time, due to the current financial and political climate.

I feel like it takes altruism to remove oneself from the equation and prioritize the interests of your clients over the potential short-term profit or gain of an immediate sale. This is what I have always loved about working with Aaron West and the West Experience group, where my best interests are the priority and my long-term objectives and financial well-being are taken into account. I look forward to a lifetime of doing business with this group.</text>

What can we say? Sung is a true professional in the Real Estate industry. He really listened to all of our wants and needs as he helped us purchase the PERFECT home! Sung is very knowledgeable and always quick to return our calls & texts. He kept us in “the know” all the way through our transaction which helped us tremendously. We will surely recommend him to family, friends, and anyone that needs to buy or sell their home. Thanks so much Sung for all of your help!      -J & E</Review>

<text>My fiancée and I are currently in escrow for our new home!! Kris was encouraging and helpful while we searched for a home which was greatly appreciated. Throughout this whole process Kris has been very responsive and provided detailed answers to every question we had! Stacy has also stepped in and has been guiding us through the escrow process and providing amazing quick responses to us. They are very professional and they are also very personable which is very comforting when making a home buying decision. Although buying a home can be a stressful task this team has made this process fun, easy, and exciting! I would highly recommend working with them.<//text>< pictures>

As the saying goes “ three’s a charm.” Chris was our third realtor and by far the best. First, he was very honest and upfront about everything, no shenanigans. He helped us determine the right selling price for our old home and was very instrumental and patient in helping us find our new, beautiful, awesome home! He would be my one and only recommendation when it comes to selling or buying a home. Thank you Chris!

Anyone looking to make move in the Modesto area must reach out to the West Experience Team. Aaron is one of the most experienced, professional and caring agents I have even known. His advice and guidance is always 100 % spot on and delivered with care. He is knowledgeable in all aspects of real estate including  buying, selling and investing.
I would work with The West Experience Team in a heartbeat and recommend them to any clients moving to the Modesto area.< /Text>

Kris LoSole was the Realtor that we dealt with. We were testing the waters on a possible out of state move. Although we hadn’t committed to placing our home on the market, Kris gave us a very thorough consult, toured our home, and answered a number of questions that we had. He walked us through what would be needed to move forward, and even connected us with another Realtor from out of state to tour homes in his state with. We ended up staying here, however Kris was courteous, attentive, and incredibly professional through the entirety of our exploration. We never felt pressured or obligated in any way. It was an experience I was very grateful for as we were tasked with a pretty heavy decision.</review>

Where do I begin? The West Team is the real deal! They listed & SOLD our home in Modesto and found  the perfect place for us to call HOME!

They are totally professional and knowledgeable of all aspects of the real estate industry. What we loved most was they listened to all the details that were important to us and treated us like we were their only clients, when clearly we were not! Oh, and did I mention we sold our home for way over asking price. THE WEST EXPERIENCE made our experience seamless from LIST TO SOLD!

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Sung is absolutely the best. I will reference family and friends to him. He is on top of everything going the extra mile! He negotiates, quickly responds to all of our questions and concerns, works well under pressure and he is very knowledgeable. We learned a lot along the way because of him. We had a short time limit because our rental was being sold due to landlords passing and needed to find a home and he was aware of the situation and took initiative and got our family in our first home and for that we will be forever grateful. If you really want somebody to really work for you, to educate you and go above and beyond for you, do not hesitate and contact Sung Park. Thank you Sung for everything you did for our family even after getting us into our home, this review doesn’t do you justice.< /Text>< Pics>

<username>SANDEEP GUPTA< /username><user_id>116109912693453861812</user_id><text>I recently bought a home in Manteca, CA, using "Stacy Granberg" of "The West Experience Real Estate Group - PMZ",
Words cannot describe how impressed I am by Stacy and her Office Team. Their dedication, professionalism, responsiveness, and above all "performance" really shined and showed.
Stacy has been amazingly helpful in almost every Request I had. She took every small Query very seriously and went beyond all means in doing a proper research and came up with multiple solutions - of course recommending the best solution - but leaving the final decision on us.
Not once did i see her hesitate in taking a task (even though it was sometimes outside her scope and realm).
Her entire office team has been amazingly super fast and responsive.
Their Real-Estate knowledge, experience, i think is par excellence and they always promote good values.
I am very happy with the Good Quality Services that they provided.
No doubts, I highly recommend them for others to try and choose them as  well.< /text>< gmapID>

Aaron West and his team turned what could have been a really stressful short sale purchase into a very easy and stress-free process. Aaron successfully and swiftly handled every issue that arose with his knowledge and expertise. In addition, he has always been generous with advice and information on the market, even several years after our purchase had closed. We will always turn to Aaron and The West Experience for any future real estate needs.< /text>

The West Experience Real Estate Group has raised the bar regardless of where you are in your journey. If you're looking to buy a home, have a home to sell or invest they provide next level service and actually took the time to properly educate me so I don't blindly make decisions. I appreciated the upfront approach they took on all matters and felt like they were always negotiating to get the best deal for me. Aaron created an environment where you feel welcome and cared about on a personal level. Using this local Real Estate Group is a no brainer, if you like things done right.</Review>

She is a pleasure to work with, always on time, ethical and a great negotiator. Always has that big smile on her face when she greets you!  I highly recommend Amanda wether you are buying a home or selling an existing one. She will be your Realtor for life!< /text>

I needed the help of an experienced realtor. I reached out to The West Experience and Kris LoSole contacted me right away. He took the time to inform me of how the whole process would go and what to expect. He also made sure to find out what type of house I was looking for. We ended up submitting multiple offers before one was finally accepted. He kept me informed and guided me through the whole process. It was a great experience working with Kris and the West Experience. They truly are the best realtors in the Modesto area!</Text>

Although, the house wasn’t the right one for my wife and I,  he took the time to help us find the right house. On the day of our move, he stopped by with soda and pizza for lunch. This act of kindness showed me, he wasn’t in the business to just sell homes, but to make our home buying experience the most pleasurable and least stressful as possible.

There’s a quote by Mya Angelou- “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.’

Thank Kris for rolling out the red carpet!

Kris LoSole has been a pleasure to work with. Always responsive to our needs, listens and catered to our specific requests in a home. He advised and supported us along the way and even when we doubted if we’d land in the area we wanted he didn’t waiver. In the end we found exactly what we wanted, it’s been a smooth process from house shopping to escrow. His team has the client in mind every step of the way. Kris was patient with our search and always had time for us even last minute. Highly recommend Kris and this team for any prospective seller/buyer. He was a true advocate during a stressful and sometimes complicated process. THANK YOU KRIS!<//Text>

<review>We met Kris at an open house in Riverbank, exchanged info and that got the ball rolling. We were barely starting our trek into buying our first home together and Kris and the West Experience really helped us narrow down our search. I had always heard of the horrible experience my friends had with realtors so we were very weary to talk with anyone. Kris and Aaron sat us down and helped us find our home. Kris was very patient and helpful when looking for homes. We would often exchange messages regarding houses available and if it was a good fit for us. They did not shy away from showing us any house we wanted knowing that would help us narrow down our search of what we wanted. In the end, we found a cozy house for our family that suits us well. Kris was with us until the very end! He almost helped us move in to our house lol. Even though its been 5 years now, we still exchange messages with Kris, sometimes a simple hi to a how are things going. Kris and the West experience really do go above and beyond. Any chance I get, I always recommend Kris. 10/10 would recommend to anyone.< /review>< username>

Being a first time homebuyer. I didn’t know where to start. I was directed to Kris through someone I knew. Kris was very patient and friendly. He listened to what type of home I was after. It made the whole experience so much more enjoyable. Kris was very good at suggesting homes that were my style and in my price range.  He was not pushy at all. I was very pleased and impressed with The West Experience.

I work in customer service, and good help is really hard to find. Now I understand why he was recommended to me. I suggest them for you too!<//review>

I’ve reached out to Sung almost 8 months ago and he has not disappointed me when taking down notes for what I was asking for. He was very detailed in what I was expecting when looking at houses/duplex and was constantly following up with me to update his list. I’ve bought two homes in the past with different real-estate agents thinking that it can’t get any better than that until I met Sung. During the process of buying my new home, I was extremely busy with my new job and Sung helped me throughout the whole process make the transition as best as possible. Unlike my past agent where I bought my home and it was just simply done, Sung still till this day (3 weeks later) calls me to check on how things are going to give me support by guiding me to the right personnel when needed. For example, my garage came apart 1 week after purchasing my home at around 7pm at night, Sung came straight to my home to help assist me with the garage and called the contractor out to get it fix right away. Now that right there my friends, is a great Agent and now a friend of mine. If you are out there looking around for the right agent, look no further and call Sung!< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Well I was fortunate to spend some time with Aaron and I wish I had met him 10 years ago. After speaking honestly and openly about setting up finances for success, I can't wait to learn more. The amount of knowledge he has is game changing. Thank you Aaron for taking the time to share with me.</Review>

Kris LoSole and his team were an absolute pleasure to work with. His responsiveness and attention to detail were very impressive to say the least, and it was very clear that Kris knows this industry and area inside and out. I would highly recommend reaching out to him and the Aaron West Team if you are looking for top notch service for all of your real estate needs.< /Review>

Sung was an excellent realtor, I would recommend him,  answers every phone call/text, sends home reviews everyday, professional, on it, you get calls and emails immediately if you want to see anything, open conversation about what you really want in a home really makes Sung a 5 star realtor. I got a great contract when I bought my house.< /text>

<text>I have worked with Sung both as a buyer and a seller (first time for both) and I have absolutely zero complaints and nothing but nice things to say.  Sung is really there to work for and with YOU, from day 1 he asks what you are looking for and uses that to guide your journey to home buying and selling.  He is personable and professional. I can and have recommended him to anyone looking for a relator in the area. Truly I could not ask for a better person guide me through the stress of buying and selling a home.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Kris LoSole is fantastic! He was extremely patient while we looked at house after house and gave me great advice as I was a first-time homebuyer. He answered any question I had, and I would have been lost throughout the entire buying process if it weren't were him. Even after owning my home for nearly two years now, Kris is still quick to answer any time I need referrals or advice. I'm extremely glad I went to The West Experience and I will continue to go with them for any future housing needs.< /Review>< pics>

Kris was AMAZING!! My husband and I decided to buy a house in this crazy market and couldn’t have picked a better agent to help us! Kris asked me what I expected out of him and I said Kris I expect you to find us the perfect home!! And so our journey begun. I would call or text him when we wanted to view a home and he would get us in usually same day. There was one specific occasion where we wanted to view a home and there were no more appointments left. Kris talked to the agent and got us in the very next day. We ended up putting an offer on that home and unfortunately were out bided. The next 2 offers after that were the same story. We were starting to get discouraged and Kris reassured us that we were close not to lose hope those homes were not for us. I didn’t know it at the time but he was right! He called me one Monday morning to tell me about a house he had set up an appt for us. I looked at the house online and really liked it but didn’t get my hopes up it was super close to the top end of our budget and felt like we would get out bided. We went and saw it fell in love with it and put an offer on it. Three days later Kris called me with the amazing news!! They accepted our offer!! Kris and the west experience team worked super hard to get our offer accepted and I cannot Thank them enough!!! Kris found us a dream home in an amazing neighborhood. If you are looking for someone to genuinely have your best interest at heart Kris is your guy! He was very responsive kept me informed every step of the way. Talked to my lender every few days to update me. Answered every single phone call, text and question I had. Treated us like family. Kris still will call and text to see how we’re doing and how the house is going almost a month after. He truly is a nice and honest person. 10/10 for sure!!!<//review>

Worked with Damien Wilson as my buyer's agent.  He was very responsive and sought out background information on identified properties so I had more to go on than just the published listing..  He listened and understood my priorities and was with me every step of the way through the process.  His knowledge of Modesto neighborhoods was valuable as I was coming from out of town.  Ultimately purchased a property near Modesto Junior College and was always pleased with the support Damien and his office provided through the process to include contractor referrals after move in.< /text>

As a first time home buyer, the thought of pursuing the largest purchase of my life was daunting. I was unsure of where to start and what lied ahead. Fortunately for me, I had the pleasure of working with Kris LoSole at PMZ. In the middle of a seller's market, I learned quickly that securing a home was going to be more challenging than I had originally expected. Kris was diligent in his efforts to find out information on the homes in which I showed interest and fast to establish a time for me to take a look at those homes. Between my long hours at work and a lengthy commute, he always found a way to accommodate my schedule.

Upon submitting an offer on a listed home, Kris provided me with the contacts of all the necessary professionals I would need to complete the purchase. Throughout the escrow process, Kris continued to keep me updated on the status and the tasks I needed to complete. I never once was left wondering what was to happen next or what I should be doing.

To sum up my experience with Kris LoSole, he was very patient and always happy to explain to me the things I did not understand, even if I did not comprehend it the first time. My phone calls and texts were always answered or returned very shortly thereafter. I was able to continue with my work and my life while feeling confident that my endeavor was moving forward. The lines of communication were open and strong. Kris was always on time, available, polite, accommodating and professional.

First I want to thank Kris for his hard work, patience and professionalism !   I was moving from Wisconsin to Calif. after my husband of 39 years passed.   I have never made this type of decision by myself EVER.   Kris walked me through this step by step explaining everything to me so I can understand everything small and legal.  You just get a good feeling from him the moment you meet.   He did not show me homes that were over my price he listened to me on what I wanted regarding size, area, and the condition of the property.  I am 100% confident to recommend him to family and friends.  He is the real thing.  Give Kris Losole a call!< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I wish there were more stars I could give. My experience with Aaron and his team was nothing short of incredible. They sold my house for 10% more than the highest listing price recommended by any other agent, and did it in under two months, from the very first phone call to the close of escrow and delivery of the purchase check.

I interviewed six agents, all of whom visited the house and provided comps. I was unsatisfied that recent sales in the neighborhood offered fair comparisons to my home, which had some unique attributes. Among all the agents I spoke to, Aaron was the only one who had the same instincts. He researched further into the past to find more accurate comps, ultimately justifying a listing price over 10% higher than any other agent. The West Experience made recommendations on critical repairs and enhancements, then hired the teams to do the work, all at way less than what we thought it would cost to get the house ready to sell. The listing and marketing process were seamless, with everything aimed at getting word out about the house (which had never been on the market) as broadly as possible. We accepted an offer on the first day, closed escrow early, and are beside ourselves with delight that the home we grew up in now belongs to an amazing new family who will enjoy it as much as we did.

One final detail:  I live 350 miles away, and never met Aaron in person—he and his team handled everything via phone, video conference, email, and digital signature, making the experience smooth and efficient for me. If you are looking for an agent who will put you first, respect the emotional investment you have in your property, offer advice driven by a wealth of experience, and never, ever treat you or your home like the next commodity in a sales pipeline, look no further.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Working with Kris LoSole was a great first home buying experience.  Kris was patient, attentive, and very helpful.  Kris took the time to learn exactly what my family and I were looking for and truly cared about me and not just my purchase.

<user_name>Stephanie Chinsami<//user_name><time>1560910627044</time><Review>I was recommended to use Aaron West and his team at the west experience to sell my home by fastexpert.com.  I was impressed by the level of promptness he showed us with all our questions and contact throughout the process. He priced our home at evaluation we felt was fare, helped us navigate necessary repairs to the home prior to listing, and exceeded our expectations with his negotiation skills. We received an offer above our asking price and he was able to negotiate issues with an appraisal being lower than what we had hoped for. He was fantastic about explaining each step of the process, and even provided reassurance for the times when we became overwhelmed with all the possible outcomes. I will continue to recommend his team to anyone looking to buy or sell, and I will definitely go to him for my next buy.<//Review></record>

Aaron West did an excellent job selling my
home quickly above market price for my area.

- I wanted to sell a little above area listings.
-  To move and relocated out of state by mid April.
-  To not spend any more $ on minor fixes.
-  Sell to good people who love & care for my home.

Aaron and his team quickly delivered on all four.

Aaron helped me on many other levels showing he was trustworthy and there to help.  He made the sale seem easy and was always there with a smile providing timely progress reports.  Thank you Aaron.
You were more than a real estate salesman & broker. You were also a friend. Many thanks from me, my family, and  my friends.  May Gods blessing be with you, your family & team always. 🙏🏻😊</text>

The West Experience was recommended to me by a friend, I was having issues with my then current realtor not being responsive and more importantly, not getting my house sold. From the first phone call with Aaron I knew the experience of working with him and his team would be different, And it was. I always felt like i was their top priority, more was done in the first week, than had been done in moths with my old realtor. The offers started coming in. We fell out of escrow a few times, But The west experience was quick to jump back into action, and get the house closed! I would highly recommend. I will never use anyone else.< /Review>

This was by far the easiest and best real estate transaction I have experienced and I have sold lots of houses.. Aron always had the right answer when a issue came up and always responded.  When we were getting the house ready for the market he had the connections to get the best colors for painting and granite countertops at unbelievable prices. We actually did less to the house than we planned to do with his advise. The house sold in 6 hours for above asking! I couldn't be happier,<//review>

<Text>We are so grateful for The West Experience Group. Aaron walked us through with prepping our old house to attract buyers. Sure enough, we got an offer after a day it went on the market. He also helped us in finding our forever home.  All done in less than 2 weeks. That’s just AWESOME!!! The Team were on top of their game. We didn’t have to worry about things not getting done. They took care of everything!
Now..for the best part of being one their clients we get to be included in all of their FUN events. “Client Appreciation Dinner” and “Family Movie Night”.  Can’t wait to see what else he has in store for all of us.
If you’re looking for a great real estate agent, look no further. The West Experience will take care of you.

From the very beginning , Aaron West upfront and honest. Whenever we had a question or concern , he was just a text or call away.  His team worked hard to get our house sold. We cannot thank you enough Aaron!  I am writing this not for praises  to him but as the truth, Aaron will be with you the whole way , he works really really hard and communicates with you the whole way through. Not once we felt lost in the process , at first we were scared to go through the selling process  but he sat with us  , explained it fully and he made good on all of what he said he would do for us. He even went beyond that.
Aaron, thank you! We are forever grateful.
The Aaron West experience is one of a kind!</review>

Aaron and his talented group keep you informed, keep your best interest in focus and follow through until the very end. The groups customer service is excellent! The West Experience continues long after the keys to your new home are delivered. Clients are not forgotten, they continue communications and gatherings long after escrow closes. Thanks to all who helped us sell & purchase our new home.</review>< Pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>First Time Home Buyer. From start to finish Sung and Aaron walked me through the entire process. I had a ton of questions. They explained everything to me thoroughly, and made sure I understood the answer fully. Sung was very quick when responding to my needs and was extremely flexible working with my wife and I's crazy work schedule.

I always felt like my business was important to them, and most importantly, that I was happy with their level of customer Service.

I would, and I will be recommending them to anyone looking to purchase a home in the Valley.<//Text>< Pictures>

It was such a pleasure to work with Aaron and his team! Buying a house is a huge commitment but Aaron answered all our questions and gave us his honest opinion about homes we were looking at and the prices for those home. He helped us buy our first starter home and sell that home to purchase our second home big enough for our growing family. I recommend him and his team to anyone I know who is thinking of buying or selling a home.< /Review>

<Text>We love working with the West Experience. We have sold and bought many houses and rentals with Aaron. They manage the details with timely  precision.

Additionally they are a company that gives back to the community and clients in many unique ways.

We could do business with a variety of real-estate companies but we choose to use and recommend the West Experience.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Since he had to work with 3 different opinions (wife, mother-in-law, and myself) it was a little more difficult to find something that fit what we each wanted. Needless to say, he was very patient. We were able to each compromise a little on what was most important to us, helping to refine Kris’ search and if we found something we wanted to look at, he made all the necessary arrangements to view those other home quickly. After fighting other potential buyers for other houses, we finally found the perfect house that would satisfy all of our needs. If your looking to buy or sell your home, you would not be disappointed with Kris or The West Experience.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>We had the most amazing buying experience with Aaron! He is attentive and worked diligently to find the perfect house for us to make our home. We looked at hundreds of houses. I know this seems like an exaggeration but I'm serious!!! We had a particular situation and The West Experience team made our dream a reality when no one else would give us the time of day. Thank you again Aaron for being so amazing!!!</Review>< rating>

From the get go I have been patient with them.  Sold a tripled with Aaronb cash deal fast close.  That was the only thing goid about the whole transaction.  His asst Michael dropped the ball and failed to food too many times to count.  2 years after the sale I am still getting utility bills because Michael who I was told was the buyers property manager didn't put the utilities in the new owner/businesses name.  So when tenants moved out I got the bill and the delinquency on my credit.  I was told by Aaron he was handling it.  Never happened.  Now I have another property that Aaron wants to sell so he was going to help me evict the tenants.  Again, Michael set it up but has failed to flow through.  Can't trust them to get the job done.  I've known Aaron for 20 years and have always had small issues with everything.  He has too much and can't handle the workload.  Loves the commission but does not reciprocate with equal professionalism.< /Review>

The West Experience team made a difficult period much smoother due to the level of professionalism, knowledge and dedication to customer service. Through every phase of the transaction it was easy to be informed and figure out the next step. Whether you are selling or purchasing a home this group of Realtors receive my highest recommendation.</Review>

<Text>We listed our Modesto home with the West Experience Real Estate Group in July 2018 and received multiple above list price offers the first weekend it was on the market! We accepted a solid offer above list price, had a quick escrow and closed less than 30 days later. Since we were heading out of state, the ease of the whole process and transaction made the move a lot less stressful. Aaron West and his team were honest, professional, organized and easy to work with. Kris LoSole handled our open house, he was amazing to work with. The buyers who purchased our home actually attended the open house and Kris connected them with a local lender who he'd arranged to be present at the open house. This made the whole process a breeze for both buyer and seller. Having a background in graphic design and social media marketing, I was especially impressed by the high quality photos and drone footage taken of our home for the real estate marketing campaign, which the West team used on post cards, their company website, Zillow, Facebook and the MLS listing. If you're looking to buy or sell a home in the Central Valley, choose the team at The West Experience! - Doug & Jenn V.< /Text>< rate>

< review>
What I can say about the West Experience. I hope this will show you when you got West your family will never go in any other directions... My family's next  home buying purchase will be the West Experience only... so here is my story..... Aaron West what can I say about this man. The way he takes care of any person that crosses his path.. Let me tell you a story about Mr. West. My wife and I meet him in 2000 when he was selling jewelry. My wife bought my ring from Mr. West, and the store he was working for. I However, bought my wife's wedding set from a different store, what a mistake that was. After we had her wedding set soldered together the company we were dealing with messed the ring all up. As we left the store my wife was very upset, then we ran into Mr. West and we told him what had happen. He could of told us sorry for our luck. Instead he gave my new bride a hug told her it will be ok, he said come with him. We went to the store he worked for and he took care of our problem as if he had sold us the ring. In no time flat he had it fixed, and had my bride smiling like, the day I asked her to marry me. After that day we only would go to Mr. West to get all of our new jewelry. Then the day came where he told us he was leaving the jewelry business, and going into real estate. We said great we are looking to buy a house.  So Mr. West went to work, and boy did I make him work hard.  Yet he never blinked an eye. At every house he would just smile, and ask my wife, "do you love this one?"untill we finally found it... The perfect house to start our family. Aaron and his team made sure everything was perfect with our new home purchase. Mr. West and his team do not treat you like some customer, they treat you as if they were buying the house for their family. The best deal and the best treatment for family. Thank you Mr. West for everything you and you team have done for our family and community. You have a forever customer with us.

I’ve bought and sold 7 homes; Arron West and his team were, by far, best in class.  Arron understands the market and was able to set the price right.  He understood our goals and helped to develop a winning strategy.  Sung Park came out with an impressive display of technology.  His 3D modeling and   drone flyovers made a meaningful impact on our marketing plan.  As soon as we hit the market, Kris LoSole was dedicating late afternoons to cover open houses.  His style and professionalism assured us of the quality we were to receive.  Finally, Mike Mendonca kept it all organized.  From last minute flyers and direct marketing mailers to contractual DocuSign transmittals, Mike kept it all organized.  Take it from someone who’s completed a lot of transactions, this is quality team.  Thanks guys.

I fully recommend The West Experience Real Estate Group - PMZ. When we found the new home we wanted 4 years ago and realized we needed to sell quickly to make it happen, Aaron and his team went to work for us and - badda bing, badda boom - the deals got done. Furthermore, The West Experience continues to genuinely keep in touch and take care of their clients throughout the year, a welcome bonus to the services they provide.</review>

Very friendly, they really know what they are doing. And the bonus back massage at the foot spa seats. This is where I want to be. I love their services. I hope they have more instagramy bling bling the next time I come. You will be happy with here I assure you.< /Review>

<Text>With the virus I'd been putting off getting my eyebrows done, I decided to stop when I saw they were open. I like how they are taking the right precautions. They lady did my eyebrows real quick and nice. Thank you!</Text></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
The  staff greeted me the person that did my nails was polite she did a good job she could have taken a little more time just to clean up the edges at the top so that it wouldn't feel so rough but overall she did a great job thank you so muchl.< /Review>

I have been coming here with my daughter (who is now 8) for several years. Today, I decided to bring my 9 month old along... I couldn’t find anyone to watch her and had to get my nails and eyebrows done for a big work event, so I just crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. Not only did they do a beautiful job on our nails and my eyebrows, as usual, but when my baby started fussing, they rocked her in her stroller and THEN pushed her up and down the aisle in her stroller until she fell asleep so I could finish getting my nails done 😍 Faith in humanity restored, today. Thank you so much for helping me out instead of shunning me for bringing a baby to a nail salon. They had a smile on their faces and were asking me about the girls the whole time, and actually seemed to enjoy that I brought the kids along. I couldn’t believe it. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Now I have all that checked off my list and I can go to my work event looking like a human instead of a worn out Mommy. 😊</text>

The salon is very clean from what I could see and the techs working here are very friendly. When I was in the waiting area, I notice how the techs would clean their stations after every customer. Which is nice to know. When it was my turn the nail tech working on me made sure I was comfortable and fulfill all my requests without fail. She was very gentle and would massage my hand in between cutting my nails, removing the cuticles and etc. I got to be honest, I just love how mesmerizing my nails looked afterward!💅😍 Fine services! 😁😊😁<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rate>

I was a walk in. I had about a 10 minute wait. I got refill with a gell polish. After she finished the fill i started to notice that my fingers were start too tingling feeling never happened before. Then nail color wasn't even close what was in the book it was suppose to be a lite pink with a lite glitter but when painted my nails looked orange with glitter. 😖 But it was still kinda cute. Sorry I Won't be back..</Review>

<text>At first i liked having this long acrylic nails but it was really interfering with my work and the place that I got them done just had to be packed. But it is okay I found The Nail Spa. An it is much different then other salons actually, they have great interior. Very friendly staff, that are very well trained and know what they are doing. I knew i was in good hands when I saw fresh clean tools. I recommend to go to this salon.<//text>< Pics>

<review>I really love this nail salon because they always give me the best customer services which i never had at other nail salon i've been before. I'm always greeted very well by the owner and staffs here. They try to make a conversation with me while working on my nails and that makes me feel good about this place. My nails always last long since they use high quality products on customers. The place is nice and has a very clean environment. I would give this place 5 stars for great staffs, high quality works, reasonable price and the cleanliness. Definitely be back again!!!<//review><date>1445637307555</date><response>None<//response>< user_id>

My first time here today based on the 5 star review, but not impressed at all. The girl who did my nails was very fast, used hardly any acrylic on my fills and paid very little attention to detail.. I've been to Beauty Secrets Nail Salon and would definitely recommend them instead.
Kinda bummed out, hopefully they will last two weeks they seem very thin..< /Text>

I have been going to this salon for 12 years. Yesterday worst pedicure ever. Never saw this lady before must be new. Very rude, very rough. My toe still hurts today. My heels feel rough. Polish looks like only one coat on some! Did not do my cuticles. I might as well done then myself for 31.00. Worst of all she did not open the package using sterile clippers etc. hope I don’t get someone’s foot fungus. The she waxed me and took 30 seconds and I went home with wax on my face. I did tip her but if I ever go there again I will not allow her to to do my pedicure. Very disappointed.<//Text>

As you walk into the store, on the right you see a variety of nail colors. The store over all is big an spacious. Also, ( the picture) There stations are very clean and neat. Not even nail dust can be spotted.

I went into the store to get a Pink and White Fill set. Which is absolutely Fabulous! They have given me a silk fil to strength my nails! Thanks so much!

I also had gotten my eyebrows done. And the lady was so gentle try to make me feel as little pain as possible. An she did a very good job! Eyebrows literally on Fleek.

I would recommend anyone to book an appointment because it is no fun waiting. It is worth the wait .</text>

My mani/pedi stays for 3 weeks or more.  Every other manicure and pedicure I get an eyebrow wax. Much easier than trying to pluck at home.  Every other wax I also have her wax my mustache.  Other places have been much more painful when being waxed.  The place is very clean and the staff are friendly and engaging. Have had a broken nail a couple times between appointments and was able to go in and get it fixed at no charge.

I hadn't went to a salon for over a year and didn't have any polish on that whole year so I know for a fact it came from this place.

The lady who greets you in the front is stuck up and gives you the impression like you're a filthy white heathen.  Not friendly.  The girls speak in their native language while they look at you and then each other.  Their professionalism was lacking but my toes did look nice and they did nice designs.  I've wised up and ventured to another salon who does a better job and offers more services that help me manage my feet better.  Their foot/leg massages are a hundred times better than Nail Spa too.  I won't be going back .  I was a fool to return after the first visit and I am so happy I found a much better place with the same pricing and better services.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Call to make appt. (im a first timer) they asked me who there does my nails? Again, i am a first timer.."ok, what time you want to come in?" 5pm. "ok, see you then". Ok,...so they don't tell me who I had an appt with or take my name. I got there at 5pm and they did see me right away although the lady before just left and she sat me down in her dirty table and continued to use previous clients old dirty nail tools....lady spoke maybe two words to the whole time and was rushing and spilling stuff left and right!! i had a gel manicure. she files the old polish off a bit before putting cotton/acetone and foil on nails (weird) and the best part is while my nails are soaking in the foil she puts lotion on my arms and gives me a arm and somewhat of hand message (WHICH IS SUPPOSE TO BE DONE AT THE END OF THE MANICURE!!) and when she tries to message my hands as the acetone is running out from the foil!! (what a dumb ass!!) the manicure part was half ass and she kept forgetting to turn the light on when my nails where under the UV light, but the french polish finish looked nice, but i wanted the french with the darker pink in the nail bed (that didn't happen either!!!). I just wanted to get up and leave with out paying!!! I WILL NEVER GO BACK!!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Had to repeat my order 3 times in 45 seconds.  No AC. No flavor. Tiny tiny portion. Workers Kids putting their dirty toys on my table and every other table.  I'd pass this place up if i were you.< /review>< Pics>

Family operated and owned. Food is great... Price is about average for a mexican restaurant. Restaurant is older but clean no sticky tables... Customer service could be better... But again the food is great 👍.....<//Text>

Really good. The tortillas are fresh, the meat and seafood are both really well cooked. The spices and flavors are more like home cooking than an average restaurant. It really is like going over to a friends house and having a hand made home cooked meal.<//text>

Came here early to yum cha with my dad, it was packed already. Luckily my dad was very close friends with the owner of this restaurant and we got seated quickly. I would definitely come back and recommend this to snyone who loves good dim sum.< /text>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>Came here once awhile when I crave for dim sum as this place is nearby my in-law house. Waiting time is between 30 - 45 minutes for party of 2 to 4 on Sunday if arrive after 12:00 PM. The restaurant has more family tables than small tables. No space to wait inside. If you have big family & would like to dine here during rainy season, call to reserve a table. My review is only for dim sum as I never dined here for dinner & lunch. Shiu mai, shrimp dumping, steamed beef ball, steamed egg yolk bun, chicken feet are my favorite. The flavor of those dishes were still the same when I ate here today except steamed egg yolk bun. I didn't see the running egg yolk when I broke it in half & not moist. Bit of disappointed. I always ordered egg yolk bun when I ate here. First time ordered taro puff & beef organ in daikon. Love both dishes. Taro puffs weren't oily & decent amount of minced pork inside with taste of taro. Beef organs were soft & flavorful. Overall, great customer services & foods with affordable price. Parking is easy as the restaurant locates in the residential area. Downside is waiting time.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqgAzsfpdITuJbfLhkz-vVyATxdTw8SmnJdwlp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkKrHI0Pq273mYEiyd4RyxJeMd26eVHn0llFBK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNeTGISHrWY7yGkD2O_WjZQucPLy2u_zRKJ4hBz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv_uBdu7ritMHGsxg_eYTCBi-30O159BGb0oR8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>One of the best 'pang lang jang (cheap quality yum)' Chinese restaurants in the Sunset district. Quick, cheap, convenient and delicious.  Come here for their value dim sum, even though I don't really want to call it value because that sounds like its not quality.  Come here for large party dinners, its all yum here.  Also, its one of the few spots you can order Geoduck Clam and not have it over charged.  We paid $33/lb, while it can easily twice that at luxury spots like Koi Palace.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Good place for dim sum.  Have a chance for free street parking.  About 8 family tables and four booths.  Four categories of items and pricing.  Good size portions.  Shrimp filling in stuffed eggplant lacking; a slice of a loaf.  Pork buns up to snuff, as were chive w/shrimp.  Chow fun basic with no flaws</Text></record>

<Text>DIM SUM REVIEW ONLY - Absolutely live coming to this place. Have to come out fro the Richmond district but it is ALWAYS worth the time and travel.  Sui Mai is one of the best I've ever had but we haven't really found anything we don't like off the dim sum menu.
I know this place is open for dinner as well but we haven't tried it yet but I can't imagine that it's way different.<//Text>< Pictures>

We ordered a set dinner for 8ppl for $150 or $158 I forgot the exact. After tax and 18% service charge (they automatically charged us 18%), the bill totaled around $210. Their foods were ok, not anywhere impressed. Services were ok, some waiters were too busy to follow up what we asked for, but some of them definitely responsive. I just thought for that price I sure expect bigger portion or more impressed qualities.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Parking was not easy, but reasonable drive around for 10 minutes or so. Food was good, but wait staff pretty much ignored me until a woman finally brought the bill and literally scolded me that $15 was the minimum for card. I was 89cents short. I told her I always leave a very good tip and that should cover it, but she continued to lecture me rudely. When I spoke to a waiter, he told me she was the boss and I must be making it up! Seriously?<//Review>

<Text>Great place to have dim sum on the weekends. But you need to be there before 10 a.m. to beat the morning and lunch crowds.  The restaurant is in a residential area so you need to be there 20 to 30mins to look for a parking space and the prices are reasonable.<//Text>< GmapID>

I really wanted a good dim sum place near me, but sadly this place is just okay at best... a few regrettable dishes... I guess I have to go further north in SF for good dim sum... I wouldn't mind going again though. So close!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<review>The shiumai, fried shrimp dumplings, and salt and pepper wings are all good here.
The haigow was unfortunately not that good. (skin was thick and uneven breaking apart when you pick it up. I'll come back to try other things.< /review>< Pictures>

Sunset district restaurant, street parking only which can be a pain. The place is always crowded so expect a wait. The food is very good and on the pricey side. Service has been both great and ok, a lot depends on who you get
You order dim sum from a menu, you can add on more but it might take a little while. Worth a visit for a good chinese meal.</Text>

<Review>Honestly one of the most disgusting restaurants I've had the displeasure of knowing. Food is prepared on unhygienic surfaces, hair in your food is commonplace, and raw meat is left on the ground in the open air.

Avoid at all costs.< /Review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) Dining with family on weekends is usually delicious and the portions are large. Today, it seems that I have changed the chef on Monday, the taste is completely different, and the portion is too small! Fried clams have sand and are not cooked! I don't think it will come next time! The waiter had a bad attitude, and refused to listen to the guests' opinions on the food. ! Not recommended! ! !

Not Recommend this Restaurant at weekday! The chief at weekday may not the same one as the weekend. The taste was not good today, but they didn't hear the voice of the customer! Disappointed !! May not come next time.

平时周末和家人来用餐味道很好，份量也多。今天周一来好像换了大厨一样，味道完全不同，份量又少！ 炒蚬有沙又不熟！下次估计不会来了！服务员态度又不好，又不肯听客人对饭菜的意见说就是这样的，实在令我太失望！！ 不推荐！！！

Decent size park but trash everywhere, the evidence of beer wrappers is present. Nice, large, green lawn. Lots of shade, small picnic area. No restrooms, nice basketball court. Dated playground.< /Review>

< Review>
Great location, clean and comfortable.  The shower could be an issue for some.  Water was not super hot ever. The pictures online are slightly deceptive.  This place is not nearly as cute as it is in the pictures.  It is adequate, clean and walkable if you are in good shape. But, for the price you may find better lodging. Also, the lobby is closed, no cleaning service, no coffee, limited staff if you want anything....all supposedly COVID related, but still we stayed at our hotels on this trip without these restrictions.  The hot tub is closed.  Patio area is small and slightly dated.< /Review>

Wow. Just wow! After a long day driving up Big Sur, we were greeted by the most amazing helper, Orlando. He helped us checked in and gave us a very detailed overview of all the spots to see in Carmel by the sea. The rooms were so charming and we enjoyed our breakfast boxes by the gorgeous fire pit. Orlando was the key to our great stay at Hotel Carmel and, to be blunt, he deserves a promotion. We will be back hotel Carmel!<//Review>

<text>The hotel location is great and the shared outdoor spaces are really nice. However, we were really disappointed with our room. We reserved a Delux King and it was not as pictured. It was really small and dark with one tiny window and one chair - it was pretty tight for 2 people! Also, we were right off the shared courtyard so our room was really loud (and we had to keep the shutters closed otherwise everyone in the courtyard would be able to see into our room making the room even that much darker). We were looking forward to a relaxing weekend where we could sleep in, but the noise in the courtyard would wake us up before 7AM. We asked if we could change rooms, but the hotel was fully booked. Based on the price (and the photos!), I was expecting a much nicer room and we were really bummed.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Adorable and cozy hotel just a few blocks off of Ocean Drive. Enjoyed my stay here, but only rating 3 stars for the late check-in (our room wasn’t ready until after 5pm when check-in is slotted for 3pm) and the lack of hot water (no one wants to take a cold shower when you’re paying $300+ a night).<//text><name>Lindsay DeRosa< /name><time>1618890960002</time><Gmap_id>0x808de66afdb65255:0x2d2e25e00ac8706< /Gmap_id><Rating>3<//Rating>< response>

Walking distance to everything (about 15 min light stroll to the main beach and a short 5 min walk to all the shops/stores). Hospitality was great during our stay. Check in and checkout was easy (covid times).< /Text>< pictures>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>A bit of a let down staying at the hotel Carmel. The staff was great but for the price of the room I would not recommend staying here. The room was extremely small and you could hear every movement and conversation from upstairs, the walls are very thin. For the $22 resort fee you get a parking spot, an empty hot tub and a grocery store muffin and yogurt for breakfast. Overall it was a bit disappointing.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Small rooms, thin walls, horrible service. Stayed in Carmel for 8 days at three different hotels. This was hands down one of the worst hotel experiences we had that week if not throughout the past decade while visiting Carmel. We stayed at the sister hotel Playa de Carmel (which was great) and decided to visit Hotel Carmel to enjoy the hot tub and outdoor fireplace. On arrival we went to inspect the amenities only to find an empty spa and firepit/fireplace that the staff refused to turn on for us even though we saw another couple enjoying it a few minutes earlier. When booking the hotel the front desk was glad to mention the hot tub but failed to include details of it's inoperability due to Covid-19. Once checked in to the room, we were disappointed at the lack of space and super cramped bathroom not to mention paper thin walls. After 1 night, we decided to cut our 3 night stay short and booked a room @ Svengaards across the street. While not as 'nice' it had ample room and friendlier service. As we were packing up ready to leave, the staff were loudly conversing about how happy they were to have our room check out. Super unprofessional especially when we apologized for the early check out and personally tipped the lady @ the front desk $100. AVOID. Difficult to mess up a hotel stay in Carmel but this one managed to pull it off!< /Text>

Spacious suite with fireplace inside and another steps from front door. Comfortable, clean and relaxing a great spot to unwind and recharge. Recommend upgrade and add breakfast at sister hotel, well worth it for fresh omelet made to order and dining overlooking gorgeous grounds. Very friendly staff all around.< /Text>

3 star hotel with 5 star pricing gets 2 stars here.  No AC or fan, windows cracked open but that did nothing to relieve the stuffy ness of our very small hotel room.  Bathroom was small and no tub space.  $620 per night was a huge waste of money.  1 star for friendly staff and one for a clean room and decent bed.   Also terrible parking lot that you have to back out of with any space you pick.<//text>

Comfortable and clean accommodations with friendly staff.  Love the overnight oats with fresh berries for breakfast and Lavazza coffee in the room.  The bagel bar is great with the variety of cream cheese flavors (hello pesto!) and delicious jams.  Wine hour features great labels, both white and red. The fire pit is a great place to sip some wine and have a conversation.  I'll definitely come back. Thanks Hotel Carmel!</Review></record>

<Review>Stay somewhere truly dog friendly. Terrible customer service and clarity around their policies. Hotel Carmel came up as a pet friendly hotel. While booking online there was no indication that some rooms would not be suitable so I booked my room. I called to inform the hotel that I would have a dog, since there are usually additional charges. I was informed that the room I was in was not pet friendly and they had no pet friendly rooms available. So now less than a week before my trip they graciously canceled my room and I was left looking for a hotel that is truly pet friendly. It is shameful that they look to list themselves as pet friendly but then only reserve a small fraction(queen rooms only) of their rooms to accommodate pets with no clarity on their website. I was treated poorly and dismissed on the phone when I suggested they update their reservation system to indicate  what rooms are available for pets. They were able to clearly indicate other specifications on their rooms, why not this. Both reservations and the supervisor I asked to speak with just told me it’s not their area, it’s someone else’s job. Not helpful and completely avoidable.</Review><Response>{'time': 1579194806682, 'text': 'Elizabeth, thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.

Beautiful hotel, great location and easy access to the beach and town. The wine hour is a great touch as well as the breakfast. The rooms are clean and luxurious. We didn’t get a chance to stay very long during this trip but I would definitely go back.

Hotel Carmel- I was wondering if you would provide the recipe for the homemade granola? It was so delicious, can’t stop thinking about it!< /Text>

Very charming, in a very charming town. Good location, helpful and friendly staff. Very cost reception area for breakfast and wine hour. Recommendable but expensive.<//review>

Visiting from UK, we had a relaxing stay. Room clean, a bit basic but it had all we wanted. We had a fireplace room and really enjoyed the sitting area outside. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was also good. A limited choice but actually it was enough. Would suggest that the peanut butter should not be near the nut free spread. Parking is a bit limited. The town itself is very relaxed and laid back. We had a great time. Off to Frisco for the second part of our holiday, I suspect Carmel has given us a great introduction to the Californian way of life.< /Text>

The amenity of waking up everyday to their beautiful courtyard filled with succulents, Talavera tile, luscious vines, a fire pit circled with soft Adirondack chairs, fireplace, and a jacuzzi is worth every penny to me!

We had a very nice overnight stay at the Hotel Carmel, conveniently located in walking distance of the shops and restaurants of Carmel. Very charming and comfortable. I give four rather than 5 stars because breakfast is quite limited, they give you very small pours at the wine hour, parking is first come first serve in a small lot, and the hot tub area is super dark! They need a light or two for safety in that area. In terms of the limited breakfast and wine hour, we recently experienced both ideas executed just a little better at Pacific Gardens Inn in Pacific Grove.<//text>

I think somehow we might have gotten the worst room in the hotel. It did not look like the images online and you could barely move around the bed, with a small sliver of a window that looked out to where people would walk so we couldn't even leave it open. Very depressing and we paid 400+.

*You should fully disclose what the room is like before you sell if for 400+ there should be a cap on a room like that ie 200 if not less.</text>

A great small hotel located near the center of town. They have a nice courtyard for sunbathing in the day, for the evenings they have a fireplace and a firepit near the hot tub. Brophys tavern is located on premises and it is walking distance from the restaurants and shops in town.<//review>

Great overall stay! Super friendly and responsive staff with a centrally located lobby which also serves as a lounge with a cassette tape player and fun collection of cassettes. Breakfast and wine hours were pleasant. Beds were super comfy. Fantastic location near everything Carmel-by-the-Sea has to offer.< /text>

This newly remodeled spot is conveniently located in the heart of Carmel. Nothing but praise. We had an upstairs fireplace room that was large, comfortable and well appointed. Staff was friendly and helpful. Bed was ridiculously cozy and comfortable. The adjacent pub under the lobby on the street level was fun and tasty for a snack. Parking can be a little difficult, but nothing too inconvenient. Lovely stay.</Text>

<Review>Hotel Carmel is super cute. We stayed here for two nights and it was great for the most part. The hotel is only two blocks away from the downtown area. You can walk to the most wine tasting rooms within 5-10 minutes.The only thing that I wish it was better was the bathroom size. Also, it wouldnt hurt if the staffs were friendlier.

The hotel was renovated last year and this was our first time staying.  We frequently visit Carmel and have stayed at a lot of properties in town.  Hotel Carmel did a great job with the renovations.  The hotel still has Carmel charm, but the beds were amazingly comfortable, nice TVs, and great courtyard with fire pit.  The staff was friendly and we enjoyed our stay.<//Review>

Staff was great, but no a/c, and weather was warm. They brought a fan, but we were under impression that the hotel was air conditioned. Had to sleep with windows open.  Only about 17 parking spaces for 27 rooms. Housekeeping staff was wonderful, but we had ants in bathroom. Breakfast was bagels or yogurt and granola. Bed was comfy. Nothing very special about this establishment.<//text>

Thanks for asking for input,  there were positives and needs improvements which ended up netting an average rating in my experience. Spacious, clean and modern room and staff were great, parking was tight, value was lower than average based on rate, fees (which were mentioned, to cover breakfast) were high based on value- perhaps better as optional,  and noise levels were high from outside normal conversations which seemed to permeate through the wall and closed windows,  car doors opening and closing, as well as neighbor units when bathroom facilities were used. I wear ear plugs to block noise for sleeping, they were not effective enough.<//Review>

It is very comfortable and it is in the middle of town close to everything. They need to work on controlling noise here though. On a Friday between noon and 4pm, very loud guests were speaking, almost yelling, in the patio area. When they finally shut up, some one spent an hour with a blower or something. Very noisy.

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>We had planned on a family reunion just before Thanksgiving at the Hotel Carmel, and we ended up inviting a few other friends to turn it into a celebration of family, marriage, and fun! Hotel Carmel was wonderful to work with and made all of the guests feel special. Using all 30 of the Hotel Carmel’s rooms, we were excited to have the patio with fireplaces and other communal spaces for friends and family to chat late into the night.

A few of my cousins were happy to re-tell how they kept Brophy’s open an hour past closing while watching a football game. Friends regaled how happy they were to wake up with a cup of Nespresso and the ocean view. A great uncle thanked the staff for cleaning his room after he later decided to switch with another guest for less walking. I appreciated the staff’s quick return with ice and a long table when my brother decided to add a 3 year old’s birthday to the list of celebrations.

Renting out an entire hotel for 3 nights might seem crazy, but I can confidently say it was worth it at Hotel Carmel. To make matters even more complicated, the Paradise Fire hit northern California at the same time of our reservation. As a result of families fleeing south, Hotel Carmel was completely booked before and after our event. I commend the hotel staff for flipping 30 rooms in a day - twice in one week.<//Review>< pictures>

Great location to Ocean Ave. Enjoyed the fire pit and outdoor fireplace. Breakfast selection is poor compared to other hotels nearby. Nespresso machine in each room but the one in our room and also in our travel mates room did not work correctly.< /review>

This is essentially a motel, charging luxury hotel prices. For over $400 per night, they provided a basic room overlooking the parking lot. Shockingly, the hotel does not even have air conditioning, unheard of for even the lowest budget lodging, and something they don’t tell you on that snazzy website of theirs or when you make a reservation. To make matters worse, the windows are very old, with non functioning cranks that prevent you from opening and closing them. When we complained about how uncomfortable the room was, we were simply told that the windows were very old and needed replacing (no kidding). Breakfast consisted of a tray of bagels and some yogurt cartons. As others have noted, they tack on a resort fee to the already high published price, despite the fact that this is not disclosed in advance, and there are no resort amenities to speak of. In many years of traveling, I’ve never received so little value for my money.<//Text>

What a wonderful hotel! Brilliant location for exploring delightful Carmel, friendly staff, beautifully fitted-out rooms, plus beds and pillows that are probably the best we have ever encountered in a hotel.

We found the hotel somewhat difficult to communicate with when booking, but persevere - it's worth it.

Tip: make sure you book a room with a fire if you're visiting in winter.</review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I have stayed here once before and the property is in a prime location, Brophy's Tavern is an awesome pub with a great bar tender, the beds are very comfortable, the room is spacious with a fireplace, and the bathrooms are newly remodeled.

The CUSTOMER SERVICE from YASSER M. was above and beyond, though. I have a wedding party staying here at the end of the month and he spent an hour with me on the phone making sure everything was perfect. I am in the services industry, and his level of commitment to my happiness should be commended. Not many people would have been as patient and kind as he would have been; we had to arrange nearly 15 rooms for different guests traveling at different times.

If you are staying in Carmel (by the Sea) and you need a place to call home for a couple days, look for Hotel Carmel and Yasser - they will not disappoint.< /review><username>Alex Motevosian</username></record></dataset><record>

It's not bad, and the rooms are decent, but it's not worth for the $$$. If I'm spending $400/night on a room, I expect luxuries such as more-than-single-ply toilet paper and housekeeping that doesn't take 4 hrs to respond.</review>

Unser Aufenthalt in diesem Hotel hat uns gut gefallen. Das Zimmer war gross und gräumig, leider war in unserem Raum die Toilette ein bisschen ungünstig konstuiert. Grosser Plus Punkt war das Kamin. Anzahl Parkplätze eher knapp berechnet.<//text>

<review>Nice BnB but noisy indeed. Ceiling and side walls are extremely thin and you hear everything. Our room was not spacious but actually as decribed so I cannot complain. Rooms are nicely equipped with Nespressos and minibar. The matraces at least for us where a real nightmare way too soft. We liked the location close to the shopping areas. Ocean is far away though. All in all I probably would select this hotel again although they did not do anything wrong.< /review><time>1495584000000</time><resp>None<//resp><user>None</user><Gmap_id>0x808de66afdb65255:0x2d2e25e00ac8706<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is legit. It’s a food truck, but has nice, spacious, covered outdoor seating. I recommend the Chili Chicken.</text>

As close to Punjab as you can get in Cali. This is actually a good truck with a large outdoor seating area. Run by a Punjabi family, the ambiance, smell and tastes are AUTHENTIC. We got the saag and chole with rotis and all was excellent. Very friendly staff. Cash only.</Text>

Do yourself a favor and stop at this food truck if you’re in Bakersfield. The gentleman that helped us was so nice and taught us a bit about the origin of the dishes. Food was INCREDIBLE. We were passing through Bakersfield on vacation and stopped to order from here both nights. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area.</review>

Tasty Indian food on way to Vegas or Los Angeles in Bakersfield, CA off I-5. Ample seating dhaba style surrounded by farms, plants and trees. Fastest service with all made to order food. Great for family dining or individual too. Person at the counter is great and pleasant. Prices are nominal. Will return back on next drive to Disneyland or Vegas.</Review>

Food is good, just wish I had the same experience with the staff as I've seen in reviews. The woman who helped me clearly seemed bothered by my questions. Made me feel horrible and stupid.  Wont be going back after two failed attempts to enjoy it.</review>

<Review>We were passing through Bakersfield when we read somewhere about this Punjabi Dhaba. We showed up and had THE AUTHENTIC DHABA FOOD in USA!! The aunty at the register was such a sweet lady and served us the food with all her big and loving Punjabi heart! Food was simply delicious and we almost had tears of nostalgia from India.

They have a lovely outdoor seating under twinkling lights. We had Shahi Matar Paneer, Chole Masala and Tawa Rotis. Best Indian food we’ve had in a very very long time in USA!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Authentic Punjabi food! We never had food of this high level of authenticity and deliciousness. Best Punjabi food all across Canada and US. If you are in the area , a visit is a must and won’t be regretted. Thanks to cooks here , we felt like eating in Amritsar!</review>

One of the best food i have ever had, on top of that staff is super sweet and they take care of guests as their family. Had the homely affection thousands of miles away from home.

PS : They run out of paranthas by noon. Make sure to reach in time to have delicious home like paranthas.< /text>

Delicious food and generous people. My friend and I had lunch - tawa roti, khadi and chole masala. The food was delicious and reminded us of home cooked food. We forgot to pay the bill and realized after we reached a different city. We called them and insisted a way to pay. They were reluctant and were only concerned whether we liked the food or not. Didn't expect such a reaction.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I'd say best north Indian food that I have ever had in US. They are a small business and food is like a home made. We ordered the food on the phone and picked it up for take away. It was ready to go when we went there. Lady who picked up the call doesn't know much english but she still took the order correctly and gave us the fantastic food. Some of the comments here referring to the lady as rude and all.. she is just not comfortable with the language. Don't mind it.

Go here for the food and you won't regret it!<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Authentic Dhaba style set up with true feel and awesome food that's worth the detour if you are driving through the highway back or forth from SF/LA/LV/DV.

The place is run by a very friendly and wonderful couple, putting food and service first before money.

PS: it's cash only place and prices are very reasonable.< /review><user>116558769772963743642</user></record></dataset><record>

Ive been to a lot of theindian  restaurants around here in Bakersfield and although a lot of them are great, they don't really have a "street food" type menu.

I was wondering if there was a food truck of some sort one day and this popped up lol

Their menu seems more street food oriented and the dish I had was great, but one food item that I have been really wanting to eat is Vada pav, and I have yet to find a restaurant that serves it here.

I know I could make it myself, but the way I work is I have to taste a dish before I make it as a reference point lol.<//Text>

<Text>I have been living in LA for 2yrs and this is easily the best indian food i had in such a long time. The folks at the dhaba were so nice, and it felt like being back home. I am coming back again for sure.

Very good food. Authentic punjabi taste. Gives real feel like indian dhaba. Menu is limited but the food is very good. Must try the Kadhi Pakoda and chaat samosa.  Just remember to carry cash though.<//text>

<Text>If you are in Bakersfield and craving some authentic Indian food then Punjabi Dhaba is a must try. It's a small place which can seat around 35 to 40 people, with limited menu but really cheap and amazing and authentic punjabi food.
We tried Dal Makhani, Chole masala and Chicken Tikka Masala with Laccha Paratha and Buttered Roti. Dal Makhani and Chole Masala tasted exactly like what you will have back in northern parts of India. Chicken Tikka masala was also creamy and mildly spicy and tasted great. Service was very quick and the uncle at Cash Counter was super nice too. Overall great experience and food.
NOTE: THIS PLACE ACCEPTS CASH ONLY.< /Text><rating>5< /rating><gmap_id>0x80ea6adf271e4d87:0x270e1f4d6d0e9f50</gmap_id><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Best Punjabi food ever !! One aloo paratha is enough to full me up. Chole Bhature is awesome as well. Samosa Chaat is superb. In short everything is lip smacking and yummy. We drove from San Francisco to Bakersfield just to eat at this dhaba.. so it definitely worth the travel and food. Also, they take only cash.<//review>

Hands down some of the best food I've had in a while. The rotis were a steal.

Considered a -1 star for not segregating waste (and use of styrofoam), but that's true of a lot of places and I don't want to turn anyone away from the food.  Ask them for the smaller paper plates.< /review>

<Text>Stopped on our way to Sequoia National Park and we are so glad we did that as it was absolutely WORTH IT.

The chef aunty is very friendly and will surely give you the real Indian dhaba experience. The quality of food is very good and very close to authentic Punjabi food.

Definitely recommend getting the rotis as they are made fresh and go very well with the sabzis

Highly recommend this place.<//Text>< pictures>

They have a fixed menu that slightly varies day by day. They make fresh roti's when you order it. Excellent mutter paneer, and butter chicken. Very fresh and tasty. Very nice people running the place.  Very pleasant picnic tables to sit and eat.</text>

<review>Amazing food. They cook wholeheartedly and serve with love. Staff is extremely friendly.
It was the highlight of the day to have dinner at this place. It felt as if we were back in India having food at a dhaba.
If you like dhaba kind of ambience and food, this is a must visit place.</review>< time>

This is a treasure in Bakersfield. If you are driving past this area, it's one of the best places to get authentic Punjabi Indian food. Very yummy taste. It's a food truck, like dhabha style, giving you a feel of Indian dhabha style ambience. Don't forget to say hi to the house cat. Prices are very reasonable. Rotis are fresh and dabbed with ghee. Like the ambience, lights and picnic feel of the tables. Our favorite is Shahi mutter paneer. Staff is very genuine and friendly.<//Text>

This is the best Punjabi food I have had since I was a little girl. I grew up across the street from a punjabi family and they would always make the most delicious rotis. When I ate this roti, it brought me back to those days! They were so soft and smelled wonderful. We also got the veg sabji, samosa chaat and kheer. All was incredible and tastes like it's straight from the home kitchen. If I find myself passing through here again, I now know where to stop.  Plus the seating area is cool and floral. A nice change for the dry scenery and there was a little cat taking a nap on some of the chairs.<//text>

The food is great. Rich, spicy, and well-made with thoroughness. Not your quickly slapped together slop.
The set up is two food cart trucks, and you order thru the window of one.
There is covered seating, which is open, but there is a heater for those cold days.
The rotis are big, the parantha is good. The curries are good.
The people are the best. The person who seemed like he owned the place talked to us about how the place got reviewed in the NY times and how they sometimes run out of curries late at night on a few days. Genuine people, genuine Punjabi food.< /text>

Highly recommend this place. Food tastes very authentic and the ambiance allows nostalgia to creep in (to all Indians here in the states).

The owner and staff are very friendly. It was a great experience and I look FCC forward to go there again.

Almost forgot, do get their Lassi!<//Review>

Amazing and comforting Punjabi good right in the middle of Bakersfield, complete dhaba style. Very warm people running the show here and if there is anything that trumps their food, then it's their courteousness. Service is quick and they only accept cash. There is a dine in area, although it's exposed to the elements. We saw many people ordering and taking for to go.

Try their lachcha paratha without fail. You can thank me later.</Text>

You get a typical Indian dhaba feel with the ambience, food and hospitality of the staff/owner. Everything on the menu is a must try, their rotis are freshly hand made right in front of you and the paratas are even more better. I strongly recommend this place to enjoy the food and the ambience. Please note that they take cash only.</review>< rate>

I don't write reviews much but this place needs one. Because it is so delicious and fresh that we couldn't resist to visit second time in just 3 days. Garlic naan are one of the best and aloo tikki too! 😋</review>

We live an hour away but take every excuse we can get to drive to Bakersfield and eat at Punjabi Dhaba.  The food is so delicious, and we've been able to try lots of new things here that we wouldn't have ever had at a "normal" Indian restaurant.  Haven't had a bad meal here yet.  We can't recommend them highly enough!< /review>

<text>I don't often give detailed reviews but this place deserves a bow and a nod. Incredible & amazing food would be an understatement for the pure, simple, authentic food they serve. Staff was super friendly, prompt service and FOOD that hits home and touches that cord. An ABSOLUTE delight, loved the rusticness and reminded of the highway dhabas from home. Definitely recommend and would drive out here specially to eat this. I don't get such food in the Midwest.

They don't accept credit cards so bring cash. Its self service, so when I tipped for the great quality of food, the lady was gracious to return the favor by giving 2 free kheers, which was flavorful, fragrant and ladden with dry fruits and just right amount of sweetness. I wish I had more pics.</text>< pictures>

Very good food. I will definitely come back. I got the mix paratha. It was $5. It was good and a decent amount of food.the onion mix has ginger in it so if you don't like ginger you won't like it. I enjoyed it.<//text>

went here after reading many reviews on another site. I recently moved here, the reason I read so many reviews. they claimed that the food was " the bomb ",  "taste home cooked" or "great food"  So when I arrived the outdoor seating was covered in  dirt. in a  farming  community a place with outside seating should  have someone at the very least be rinsing the table tops off where people eat,
The menu was very very limited & was printed on a tattered piece of plastic with something written by hand on it that was too smudged to read & taped to the ledge where you place your order.
I have been eating indian food for about 47 years now from all over L.A. and the San Fernando valley. so I think im a pretty good judge of indian food. Over the years I've had Punjabi home cooking  made by co workers for countless pot lucks or parties  So all i can say to those 5 star reviews  is  WHAT!! and to those looking for good  indian food  look elsewhere  I would rate the food at minus 1  if I could< /Text>

<Text>Let me tell you all something, this place is far the best Indian food place in the whole Southern California if not in the US. Delicious taste is not all you get. Every ingredient they use is aimed at quality, healthy minded people combined with extraordinary culinary skills makes it my favorite Indian restaurant.
I am a Brazilian native and love these Indian people, love Punjabi Dahba's food.
Once you tried you'll share the same opinion.

Ps. The owners will treat you like a king.</Text>< user_name>

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's craving some Indian food. It's probably the best in Bakersfield!
We were returning from Las Vegas to go back home towards California, and hadn't had our lunch yet; it was 630 pm. We were so hungry and the food of this place just reminded us of home! This place has less parking at the front but don't worry about the location cause the moment we entered the smell was just amazing. We ordered Sahi Paneer, chole, roti and dal makhani with jeera rice. Everything was just absolutely delicious! The best was Sahi Paneer and the roti was like home chapati. The roti was fresh and hot. Even the onions given on the side were good and reminded us of India.< /review>

There was stagnant water near the seating area. Food was ok. Some small kitchens in sf bay area have much better food but given the location, food was not bad by any account. Overall an average punjabi food truck.< /text>< Pics>

Cash only food truck that serves excellent Punjabi food at very reasonable prices. Definitely recommend their dal makhani and mix parantha. Delicious chai and salted lassi as well. The owners are also extremely nice people who were very accommodating to us as we struggled to find enough cash. Our experience was so great that we ended up going again within a couple of days.<//Text>

< Review>
For a quick stop and super fast service on I5, this is a great spot. The food was delicious. The paneer was just as soft as we would eat at Punjab. The food was home cooked with a lovely lady manning the stove. The menu was quite limited but that is expected of a food truck. However the masala chaas, shahi paneer and Dal Makhani that we had were absolutely yummy and tasted just like the food at a good Punjabi Dhaba at Punjab or Haryana. The paratha was well stuffed, as you'll find at a proper punjabi restaurant back home. Meant to be consumed with salted butter, the taste was one to remember for a street side eatery. Order to table took about 7 minutes. So pretty quick<//Review>

<Text>SimplePunjabi Dhaba Truck.Wat a hidden gem.After long drive we arrived at Punjabi Dhaba.i was not shure if I realy  want to eat here from a truck.Despite my reservations my son ordered  rotis.Dalmakani.and butter chicken.roti was freshly  made just like you do at home.Rotis.They made deserve  5 stars just for the rotis alone.99% of resturants can not make simple rotis.Dall was my fav.Totaly flavorful.Kala channa done  ryt too.Butter chicken was tasty.The owner  cares wat he gives you to eat.Wish his family. Lots of luk.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< GmapID>

We were on our way back home to California and we were delighted to eat some parontas on the way. They were huge and delicious, and the lady was super friendly!</Review>

Just Amazing Punjabi food.  Please don't miss a chance to have food here if you are around.  Try Samosa Chat. Punjabi Kadhi pakodi.  Chaas is also amazing. Simple Chapati makes it just soul food.<//Text>

Once I got to this little place I was greeted and welcomed by the owner with full on positive vibes, told me which dishes they had available ;because they dont always serve the same thing here which I dont mind.
I decided to go with the original, Chicken Tikka Masala, sweet but fiery hot because well that's how I wanted it and thats how I got it, keep in mind that your level of spice is all on how you order it, in other words they ask how spicy you want it. The food was given to me in a container so I can gradually serve myself as I went on digging in with their warm Rotti (indian style tortillas). The Chicken Tikka was as good as it smelled, the meat was tender and full of flavor till the last flaming hot bite.
As for my lady, she decided to go with the Chole Masala which she wanted spicy as well. Chole Masala was new to me so I decided to give it a go, it wasnt as spicy as my dish was but was as equally delicious.
I might be wrong but I believe it was a type of curry with chickpeas, cilantro, onion and maybe some ginger to give it that kick. She enjoyed this dish with a big ol Paratha (potatoe stuffed tortilla) which I had to try with me being a potato enthusiast, and I gotta say, I didnt just have one , two or three bites of this, I had to get my own before I finished hers.

Punjabi Dhaba is one of those hidden gems that I came across, now with them being on the map you can also find this place too.
Great food, great people, Cash only.
Enjoy</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Must visit to get a authentic taste of Indian food if you are near to the area. Exactly in Indian Dhabba style place near the Freeway. Not many items in menu but whatever they have in it is awesome. Really good samosa chat and tawa roti (not tandoori but its thin) and panner and dal. Sitting arrangements is outisde but okay but if you are going out for dinner then bring some layers with you during winters.< /Text>< Pictures>

Had authentic punjabi food for the first time in the USA. I tried paneer sabji and Daal Jeera Rice. Ask for medium level spices. They have seating area too. Sign board is not noticeable but trust the google navigation. I highly recommend this place to all who love punjabi food. Very reasonable price of food.</Text>

Small but well managed place that serves delicious north Indian food. Ironically didn't have chhole bhature for being called a dhaba. Restrooms are in an adjacent facility; not the greatest; carry your own TP and soap!<//text>

<text>We were on West Coast for holidays and reached our hotel at 8;00PM, wife said Indian food will be a good option. We found this Punjabi Dhaba (~10 miles) online and drove out of curiosity, what a nugget this place is. Food is amazing quality, roti's (reminds one of Maa's roti's), reasonable price, quick service..Balvinder Singh and team are amazing..My daughter  (born in USA) said the food taste was so good, hindi came back to her head.. she was singing "kal ho na kal songs" on way back... wish we had one in Atlanta...

<Review>My friend Mr Khullar took me for a bite. Had prantha (indian bread stuffed with grated vegetables - in my case Cauliflower). Was awesome, brought back memories. A hidden gem, will be there again to try the main entres. Highly recommended for Indian food lovers with an open air picnic style eatery.</Review><userid>115060262107417372108< /userid>< Name>

<Text>We stopped by on our way up from LA, after unsuccessfully searching for South Indian food along the way. Boy was that a good happenstance!

The place is tiny. It's literally a food truck + some seating. And it's very difficult to see it if you are driving by. We had to look around a little after parking on the street nearby. The signs aren't particular good.

The menu is pretty short, which is surprising for an Indian restaurant. The girlfriend had a ton of questions about what the various dishes were, which the owner dude explained pretty well. We got a chai (oh definitely try it), a 16oz order of butter chicken (which is actually a lot, we later realized), an 8oz serving of the sabzi (mixed vegetables dish), and a lot of roti.

The butter chicken was some of the best I've ever had. You have the option to get it mild/medium/hot BTW. Be careful with the hot. It definitely is spicy.
The mixed vegetables dish was really good too, but the chicken totally took over my taste buds. I had to buy an extra order to go 😬.
Roti were really good too. They use butter to dab the insides, which makes it extra yummy.

Overall, couldn't find a negative with the food. It's extremely bare bones, so go just did the food.</Text>< pictures>

Food is average. whatever is listed in the menu more than half of things weren't available. not even the tea 😓. they made food off menu the day we were there. they didn't have free cup of water, I was forced to pay for bottle of water 😔 . they miscommunicated my order as well for which we had to wait longer than expected. I wouldn't go back to eat there. keeping my fingers crossed.. as they say never say never lol..</review>

FANTASTIC veg and non veg options. Kala chana was great. Chicken tikka masala was A+ . Aloo Gobhi paratha rocked. Great home cooking with excellent blend of spices. Highly recommended.  Remember it's a dhaba ;-) don't go looking for a ritzy experience this is for food that's cooked to taste great. I was there with my family they are very hospitable family run.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I am glad I found this place. We were all hungry from our way back from Yosemite to LA and were searching for Indian restaurant. 5 stars are all for food and friendliness. Dal makhani is absolute best. Everything else is as fine tasting as makhani. Tava roti you can literally eat as is, no gravy of any sorts needed. If you are coming on 99 freeway its a must stop place, if you don't care about the ambience and locality. Well its dhaba american style.
Info:: It's cash only place. I didn't have much cash.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

In the middle of nowhere, we found this gem of a place.
Authentic Punjabi food . Humble,simple but so good!
Reminded me of an authentic roadside Dhaba from back home in India.
The rotis and the chicken tikka stole the show.

P.s- they accept only cash, so be prepared!<//text>

I went in there without the intent to buy anything and the guy working gladly played tracks on equipment I could never hope to buy for a solid hour. Their record selection is small but good quality records.

I’m into high end audio and really enjoy discovering new equipment and the impact it has on elevating the listening experience.  I met with the owner, Alex, not long after he opened his store.  I was very impressed by his passion, depth of knowledge and focus on helping me with my specific needs.  Finding the right equipment, is one thing, but finding someone who knows so much about the sound and the manufacturing quality is critical to a satisfying purchase.  Alex will spend the time with you no matter how large or small your needs may be.  I had an exceptionally good buying experience with Alex (purchased a pair of Raidho C4.1s), and continue to be delighted by them as they daily bring me immersive joy listening to a variety of music.  I don’t see Alex as a salesman but as a friend who deeply shares a passionate interest in music who loves to help others find the best equipment to satisfy their needs.  When deciding on your next audio purchase, I highly recommend Alma Audio and their friendly, competent staff and encourage you to check them out.< /review><userid>103662002320365616087</userid><Time>1599157187071<//Time><Resp>None<//Resp><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

Had a great time at each visit. Never felt unwelcome and was able to demo some fine equipment. Never felt rushed or pressured. The equipment I did purchase dovetailed perfectly into my existing system. Overall a great experience.< /Review>

A few months ago I ordered Degritter record cleaner.  It came promptly, and I am very pleased with it.  Your website has lots of great and interesting stuff, and I'll keep it in mind whenever I need anything new and excellent.

<text>I shop  around at a lot of different high end stores and Alma is the best of them all. The owner sold me a Luxman integrated but wanted me to hear its potential first. He set up the amp with some Wilson speakers and let the amp warm up and break in to the sound stage he wanted me to hear. i own Mcintosh and currently have both Mcintosh and Luxman systems set up. LUXMAN is the best phono sound stage out of the two systems</text><Resp>None</Resp>< time>

<Text>I wanted to purchase a specific brand of streamer but I needed a place that took Synchrony Credit.  I wanted to take advantage of an occiasional 18 mo. no interest offer around 4th of July.  Alex from Alma looked into it, told me the dates that the offer was available and facilitated my purchase from NY.  The item was great, Alex's knowledge is great and helped me make the purchase possible, I will purchase from them again.  Highly recommended.</Text>< pictures>

I have been into high end audio for 50 years and I can honestly say that Alex and Fabio from Alma Music are the best to deal with. They carry state of the art everything and at every audio show in which they participate, their rooms always rank in my top 3. They have exceptional skills in speaker setup and they will never over sell you. Tell them what you want and what your budget is and they will design you a great system. They are worth the travel to their store. Their customer service is second to none.</Review>

Alma Music and Audio offered gear from several fantastic manufacturers not ordinarily available like AirTight, Nagra, YG Acoustics and Graham Audio. The staff was very friendly and readily accommodated listening to various gear. They achieved great sound, especially in their biggest listening room. I recommend a visit to Alma Music and Audio if you are into audiophile stereo gear or just interested in learning.< /review>

These guys are absolutely phenomenal in their business and customer service! Without a doubt, I will be returning to them for new equipment. Alex offered me sincere help with an issue I had after ordering my Technics SL-1500C, and it was fixed immediately, professionally, and with genuine kindness. He and Fabio are the best combination I've encountered in audio and personality, and I am immensely grateful for having stumbled across them :)</Review>

Fantastic experience with an out of state purchase.  Fabio was extremely responsive from the beginning of the sale all the way through to delivery.  When my package arrived I was pleased to see how well it was packaged to ensure nothing damaged my equipment in transit.  Very impressed.< /review>

<Review>The proprieters were informative and patient with me. I made it clear from the outset that I wasn't prepared to make a purchase, and they were still perfectly happy to let me listen. I heard some of the best stereo systems I've ever heard that day - Wilson, YG, Dartzeel - brand names that now live in my pantheon of aspirational gear. Go, and be prepared to have your horizons broadened!< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Alex is the Man!  He heads an elite team of Audio Sages whose knowledge and professionalism are beyond reproach.   The welcome and hospitality I felt during my short visit to their La Jolla store were heartfelt and genuine.  I was never pressured nor rushed to buy anything.  Although I only bought some rack and records, I was treated like a royalty the entire time.  I also got to listen - in the sweet spot - to one of the most realistic sound systems I've ever heard!  Let Alex and his honchos take care of all your audio needs.  They know their $%iT!</Text>

This is a great store for nice audio equipment. Amazing turntables and speaker/amp set-ups. Alma has a great record selection and the listening options are terrific. They are always happy to help find music you might be looking for and will order it for you. This place is worth your time.< /text>

It is now 18 months since Alex and Fabio came to my East Coast home to install a Bergmann Galer/Odi TT and an MSB DAC the reason for the end of this review.

Today Fabio came by my house to listen to my broken in system and to install a new cartridge since I trashed my ZYX Optimum.   They were in my neck of the woods installing a pair of new Wilson Alexx V's at a close friend of mine.  When I hear that they were coming by my place I spoke with Fabio about my cartridge situation.

Fabio said that the best analog rig he has ever heard is my turntable with an Air Tight Opus 1, which was more than I wanted to pay, having just retirted and trashing an $18K czrtrtidge.  He did some research for me and recommended a cartridge that he is not a dealer for and offered to get me one from their distributor and install when he was back East, (today).  The cartridge is a My Sonic Labs Signature Platinum, made and designed by the same man  who owns Air Tight and did all of their designs.

He spent 3 hours adjusting my turntable to optimize the Bergmann for the  new cartidge.  Bottom line it is amazing and I paid for it with some of the monies they made from selling my previous system, saving me a huge pain in the butt.

This rexperience is no different than what I wrote 18 month ago and follows in the next paragraph.  These guys are the ture real deal and very informed.  For the amount of time they spent procuring the cartridge driving to my home (3 hours round trip) and 3 hours adjusting my turntable for a relatively small profit, which to me speaks loads about their core fabric.  YOU CANNOT DO BETTER THAN ALMA, ALEX AND FABIO.  7 STARS ON A SCALE OF 5

First review 18 mo0nths ago.
Alex and Fabio and Alma have not just been amazing they have gone so far beyond the call of duty that I can’t speak highly enough about them I live on the East Coast and they are in San Diego and each of them are flying to my house at their expense to install some of the equipment I bought from them. I don’t know anybody else who would do that in the high-end audio business.</text>

I live in Sacramento area and there are no dealers here who offer in-home demos of gear. I was looking for information on a particular dac and found Alma's contact info listed on the dac manufacturer's website. I called just to ask questions. Alex was incredibly patient and helpful. He sent me a demo unit (no re-stocking fee !) that I auditioned in my system and I've subsequently placed an order. High End Audio can be very intimidating and there can also be a lot of "attitude" that goes with it. Alex is very knowledgeable but also refreshingly relaxed and down-to-earth. There is no pressure to buy. This is how the audio shopping experience should be. If you live in the San Diego area and love music, you owe it yourself to check these guys out!< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Very fine collection of top quality mid priced and high end audio equipment that any discerning audiophile or audio enthusiasts would love to browse and/or purchase. They have an excellent treated main demonstration room for proper equipment auditioning and evaluation for critiquing for placement in your system. A must for any purchase large or small in my opinion. They also have a wide ranging vinyl selection from which to choose from. I've been eyeballing some Ifi pieces for the past year and have not seen them in person until now. They look good in person, iPhone like in presentation. They also have some sweet deals on used equipment like a monster Audio Research amp that just keeps calling my name. I troll eBay vintage High Fi and HighFiSharks, but with what Fabio has on hand and his willingness to listen to my needs, a rarety, I'm thinking "Home Sweet Home" for my audio fix. And Soul is very knowledgeable as well. I'll definitely be spending some free time on Convoy Ct. in the near future.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<text>Purchased a Phono Pre Amp here back in December. I was appreciative that Alma music gave us the time for a demo instead of quietly doing paperwork while we walked through the store. Will come back next year.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I contacted Alma because they were listed on the Aqua site (I was interested in Aqua's La Voce DAC).  I spoke to Alex, who informed me, much to my surprise, that  he'd be willing to ship a demo unit to me to try out at home.Once I'd received the unit,  I spoke to Alex numerous times and he was unfailingly friendly, patient and knowledgeable.  High end audio can sometimes be associated with a snooty attitude and Alma sells some very expensive gear but Alex is refreshingly accessible and down to earth. La Voce sounded great in my system and I ended up purchasing one. Honestly, my experience with Alma couldn't have been better. When it comes time to upgrade again, you can bet Alex is the first person I will contact.  San Diego audiophiles who haven't visited Alma don't know what they're missing.<//text>

<Review>The employees here are GREAT, they always make me feel like I'm visiting the Cheers (1980's sitcom) version of a coffee shop. My beverage is always made PERFECTLY. Plus, this location has a convenient drive-thru. What more can you ask for?< /Review></record>

< Text>
The two things I like most about the coffee Bean is one it's menu they got a great selection something for everybody and it's location it's centrally located for me, so it makes it easy to swing in there get a coffee, snack and catch up on my paperwork take a quick break, and if you're an early riser it's a great way to start your day staff is always cheerful and I never feel rushed it's a nice place I'd recommend it to my family and friends.<//Text>

Bought a carmel cappuccino and it was amazing! 👏🏽 ❤️
Decent price and fairly quick service.
They also have a huge selection of pastries, desserts and additional food items.
💯 percent would recommend over starbucks 😂! :)< /Text>

Coffee is good but it took us more than 30 minutes to get a cup of coffee from drive through, which defeats the entire purpose of drive though< /text>

Usually very good, but their posted hours aren't correct. On the window sticker, it says they're supposed to be open until 10pm, but it seems like they close before 9pm most of the time.

Update: noticed they've been open as posted lately. I just don't advise going late, as you might get a sarcastically large amount of powder in your latte.</Review>

The standard hot Caramel Latte tastes better than the Starbucks version. The DriveThru isnt as crowded as most Starbucks DriveThru's. The employees are nice. The lid is designed poorly compared to Starbucks though. If you're rocking back and forth while driving coffee splashes out the hole on your shirt. The Starbucks lid doesn't do this. Unlike the Starbucks app the Coffee Bean app doesn't have an option to tip from the transaction screen. If you have notifications disabled for the CoffeeBean app you can NOT tip.< /Review>

TOM WAS SO GREAT!!! He was super helpful and sweet when I asked about a menu item. The item he recommended was the flavor combo I was looking for! (Matcha Green Tea Latte with soy milk) Thank you to Tom.<//Review>

This store always seems to be out of something and they are always severely understaffed. It is not uncommon to wait in the drive-through for 30 minutes with only 2 or 3 cars in front of you. The staff are friendly but there is a logistical nightmare going on internally< /Text>

<text>It is a nice coffee shop, located in Sierra Lakes Village. I have been at this establishment several times, when getting coffee in the morning, before going to work. Of course, I frequented this place, before the COVID-19 pandemic. I would usually drink several coffees, so I would be awake and functional in the office. The prices were quite fair. Furthermore, the wait times and lines, in the morning, were not long. So, I would recommend to stop by this coffee shop in the morning, before the lines form up.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c34c01f18d8c75:0xfeb366d33f84ade9<//Gmap_id>< response>

Power workers :: 3 plugs in a cafeteria style setting featuring a couple of areas with comfy, vinyl chairs.

My new favorite is the Iced Hazelnut Latte over Almond Milk... less calories with boosted protein... beats health shakes I think... lol

Who doesn't love going to ths coffee shop? I believe it is so much better than the other competition. I don't know but for me it seems as though they always have a better selection, and the staff seemed to be more personal and have a better attitude.< /Review>

Nice quiet coffee/tea house.  Sit indoor or outdoor.  Drive thru is fairly quick, but watch out when you're exiting; Ralph's cross traffic can be dangerous...If you park to go inside, be prepared to share the Coffee Bean parking with Ralph's customers. Staff is friendly and welcoming.</text>

This is a very good place to go for coffee especially if in a hurry. The staff is always much faster than any Starbucks in the area including in the drive-through. Best of all, the coffee drinks are less expensive and taste better than Starbucks by a country mile...no burnt taste here!<//review>

<Review>Fast and friendly service and superior coffee. Jackie (GM) is seen here often and she runs a great operation. Always look forward to coming in on weekends to unwind with a fresh coffee. This place is so great my 4 year old son demands a weekly visit for the pastries and Pellegrino! Great work Coffee Bean staff!!< /Review>< Pictures>

I normally go to Starbucks but my friend really wanted to go here so I agreed. And I might not completely change over to the coffee bean there is definitely some things I would just go to the coffee bean. I definitely recommend the iced matcha latte.<//Review>

My first time going to an Coffee Bean & Tea leaf, it was a good experience. The store was not packed, and line was not long. A great alternative to Starbucks, they also give a Military Discount. The service is great, and I ordered a "Dark Chocolate" (the sweetest drink I could get that they offered) and it hit the spot.< /Text>

<Text>Being new to the area I was glad to find that there are plenty around a 20 mile radius however, this particular building was one of the smallest I've have seen. Not very many furniture to sit in but what matters most is the coffee and service which is top-notch always. I once got my order wrong because of miscommunication between the cashier and I, so I politely asked if there was any way I could get what I wanted and within seconds I had a delicious iced green tea latte in my hands!<//Text>< Gmap_id>
