Since the first day of visiting this dental group, it has been a blessing for me to have a dentist like Dr. Kim.
The staffs here are caring patients as they walk into the office. During this Covid-19 time especially, they put their all effort to maintain a safe environment in order to protect patients and their staffs. I was guided to sit 6 ft apart and led to a separate chair when I was treated.
Most staffs here are bilingual, so don't worry about the language barrier. I'm sure you don't want to have any misunderstanding between you and a doctor. Here, they answer all your questions kindly. Jenny, the manager is very friendly. Before they intervene any treatment, they always explain what they are going to do. I appreciate their thoughtfulness.</Text>

<review>M Dental is hands-down the best dental practice I've ever been to. I have EXTREME anxiety about the dentist, even just cleanings, and when I moved to the Fullerton area about 3 years ago and was looking for a new dentist, Dr. Paul very patiently answered all of my questions. I'm sure I drove him absolutely nuts, but he was incredibly empathetic as was the entire office staff. I've seen them for several cleanings as well as a crown replacement and a deep cleaning, and all of my experiences there have been wonderful. I also find them to be very honest about the dental work you actually need done. Highly recommended.</review>< pictures>

I came here after I had a dislocation of one of my front teeth with no idea about how I could fix my situation. Other dentists that I had consulted left me feeling helpless with no good solution to fixing my smile. It was obvious from the information I was receiving from this office that they had my best interests at heart. Dr. Kim has made my smile perfect, better than it has ever been, while entirely retaining my own natural tooth that had suffered severe trauma. Thank you Dr. Kim!!< /text>

<Review>Dr. Kim is the BEST dentist ever. I have an extreme anxiety about dental treatment but after experiencing M dental Group, I feel a lot more comfortable now.
He explains step by step what I'm doing and why I need the treatment and gives all the options possible. I can truly feel how much he cares about his patient. Also, the facility is so beautiful, clean and modern and all staffs are nice and friendly.
I have experienced so many dentist but Dr. Kim is the BEST!
I'm so glad I met Dr. Kim and he saved my life. I highly recommend M dental group to anyone who needs dental care!< /Review><pics>None<//pics></record>

I have now been a patient of M Dental for about two years, and have nothing but great things to say about the entire operation.  From the front office staff to the treatment of Dr. Paul, I am proud to recommend them to anyone looking for caring dental professionals.  They always do their best to explain exactly what the process will be.  When any work needs to be done, you know exactly the steps involved, and the costs associated with the procedure.

I especially am thrilled with the gentle demeanor of Dr. Paul and the soothing way he asks if I'm doing OK during the work he does.  I recently had to have a root canal, and I a not the bravest patient in the world, but Dr. Paul would stop, look me in the eye and ask me if I was ok.  It was very reassuring.

I would also like to mention Rina who runs the front office.  She is knowledgeable, kind, polite, and thorough.

Thank you M Dental from a self-professed "chicken".Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

There are absolutely no words to describe how awesome Dr. Kim is! I am so thankful to have been introduced to this Mental Group! He saved my root cannel that had been infected because of another dentist in Germany and he really made my teeth like new and clean! I would definitely recommend all my friends and family to go to his dentist because he is a very intelligent, friendly, honest and precise person! You won't find this combination anywhere else!
THANK YOU SO MUCH DR. Kim for everything!< /text>

Just had a cleaning done this past weekend. And this is going to sound weird, but I actually enjoyed it. It was very thorough and gentle, which hasn't ways been the case for me at prior dental visits.

Ladies in the front were very sweet.  Explained everything in great detail. The office was spotless!  Great ambiance. When I checked in, felt like I was at a fancy boutique hotel!

Met the doctor- Dr. Kim- who was very nice and provided a status on every one of my teeth!  (Since this was my first time visit).  He also used a pretty cool mini camera that took pictures of my teeth, from behind/below my teeth!  It was a trip, actually, to see those photos. Very cool indeed!

All in all, I had a great experience.  Check in was quick. Office was clean. People were nice. Procedure was smooth. Can't ask for more!  Esp from a dental office.</text>

<text>After moving to M Dental, I actually look forward to going to the dentist! I got braces here over the summer, but I'm in Boston for school most of the time so Dr. Kim and his staff have been very good with working around my schedule. Every visit has been an extremely pleasant one! I've had little to no pain after every visit, and that's including braces tightening and a wisdom tooth extraction. The facility is clean and well-maintained. Everybody in the office is super friendly and knows what they're talking about. Plus, they give you a neat travel kit with a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, mouthwash, etc. I always tell my parents and all my friends how much I love my dentist and I really mean it!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Rate>

<Review>I had an excellent experience with M Dental! M Dental feels like home! I haven't been to the dentist in 3 years and have generally always had a bad experience, but M Dental evidently puts patient care as their number one priority. The front office, staff, and doctors are all very professional and tender to the patient's needs and comfort. I love that M Dental does away from the stereotypical dental office appearance - dull, boring, and nerve-wrecking. It feels like you're walking into an inviting, warm coffee shop to meet a friend. M Dental definitely puts the M in Modern. I love coming here and I always look forward to my next visits. You should definitely consider coming here for your next check up, I guarantee you, you will not be disappointed. Have a great day! :)< /Review>< gmapID>

It's been almost 3 years and M Dental has always been the best!

I never like going to the dentist. So I definitely dreaded looking for a second opinion after my old family dentist suggested I take out both my front teeth and get implants. He told me getting braces would make them fall out anyways. It was horrible.  Needless to say, it was a definite "NOPE!" My friend recommended M Dental, and everyone at M Dental was so helpful, understanding and accommodating and very patient. It was definitely a wonderful experience.

The facility's are all bright and clean. And they have updated equipment and tools. The staff are all lovely, and they explain every procedure in detail step by step. I'm never afraid to ask questions when I don't understand something. They helped me with my ortho and wisdom teeth extractions. (This is my second ortho procedures because my old dentist didn't do it right). I trust them so much that I brought my mom to have her root canal here.

If you want experienced professionals in a familial atmosphere, I recommend anyone looking for a dentist to give M Dental a try!!< /review>

<Text>I had many bad experiences at the dentist when I was a child because I had so many cavities and weak enamel.  But when I switched to this office in 2015 I was so happy I did.

I have had both Dr Paul and Dr Janet do orthodontic work on my teeth and I enjoyed working with both of them and appreciate how the appearance of my smile has evolved!

Also, everytime I go in for a cleaning or routine visit the front office always welcomes me. All the hygienists that I've had work on my teeth are all so sweet. I've never had a bad experience, they always try to make me feel comfortable everytime and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants a healthy, shining smile!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<username>Alicia Cronin</username><Pics>None<//Pics><text>Though they had a comprehensive consultation, I do not recommend their services. Consultations should only have to take no more than 20 minutes and we were there for 2 hours. Not a speedy process. Then they assumed we would take their services. As we discussed with the financial manager, the braces for some reason were about $2500 by themselves, I needed extraction done which would have been an additional $2,000 (and not done at their facility I might add) and lastly, the financial manager threw in an additional $350 out of no where! They had a "deal" on groupon but it essentially covered nothing AND they would not offer any payment plan unless on approved credit. I have gone to several other consultations afterwards that took way less time and the estimated bill was much cheaper (and the practice is still credible). I understand that braces are expensive in themselves but I will not be charged up the yin-yang when I can take an extra 20 minute drive for quality care and a significantly LOWER cost.

<Name>stev ZEL<//Name><Date>1353547726779< /Date><rating>5</rating><Review>Hi I felt good and comfortable in M Dental Group, because everyone was nice, and assured that I get a close look at the dental work to be done on my teeth, with an x-ray that revealed some of the careful measures the doctor had to take to avoid coming in contact with some nerves in the gums, something exclusive of M Dental Care. I found this kind of care for their patients teeth to be more modern than other dental offices. I felt good after the treatment, for having my 2 of 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed from my mouth. Nonetheless there was some pain, but the reason why I write such a positive experience is to reflect on some of the relief I felt to know what was inside of my gums and how severe my dental case was when speaking of removing my wisdom teeth, specifically the ones near my jaw. At the time I realized I had more of a chance for things to come out better here than on the other dentist office, because I was never told that the treatment could hurt so much until I came here. M Dental Group had a solution to the bottom impacted teeth seemed reasonably possible at the time, even though the other place was not all that bad either, it is just that the latter (previous place) never told me how sensitive the nerve is on the wisdom teeth, and how only one of my bottom teeth should have been taken out, instead of the 2 they were telling me to have taken off the same day. I am due to go back later in December to have the other 2 impacted wisdom teeth removed, and thus far my gums don't hurt, and I don't have any pain. Well, both places were sound, but I feel M Dental Group is the smarter choice for being more informative, and because I would imagine people need a dentist who has a gentle approach to avoid any excessive opening of the mouth with the hands, since this is detrimental in the comfort of patients like kids, seniors, handicaps, etc. Alright, well that is all I have to say, and Thanks Alot M Dental Care!!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

My husband has some of the most challenging dental issues to be treated, mainly due to the poor treatment done by our previous dentist, which has been going on for the last 2 years.  My 37 yr old husband almost lost two molar teeth because of the malpractice and Dr. Paul Kim literally cleaned up the "whole mess" and saved my husband's molars.  A big lesson learned - when choosing a dentist, I think everyone should be very careful and have the same degree of seriousness and effort to find the best as you would do when looking for any other medical doctors for any illness.  For me and my family, I want a dentist who really knows what he's doing. Availability is also important.  If he is friendly with a great people skill, that is a plus. Dr. Kim and his staff at M dental, are not only on top of things when it comes to dental treatment, but they are also very professional, accommodating, and friendly.

Apart from my husband's extensive experience with Dr. Kim in getting treated on his cavity on molars, I myself received orthodontic treatment from Dr. Kim, which took about 20 months and I was very happy with the result.  Particularly, I was impressed by Dr. Lee's passion and professionalism - he really goes above and beyond to get the job done and he really cares about his patients.

Our 3 yr old son also receives dental care from Dr. Kim.  Although M dental is not a specialty dental clinic for kids, their clinic environment is very warm and welcoming.  Each treatment room has a flat screen monitor with a variety of programs including kids programs.  Our son recently had an accident at his school while playing with his classmates and his two front teeth were almost knocked out by a hula hoop.  When we contacted Dr. Kim's clinic after picking up our son at school, he asked us to bring him in though he knew that we were going to arrive after his office hour.  His staff waited for us after the closing hour and again, our son's babyteeth were saved.  It was another pleasant experience and I felt that Dr. Lee was treating my son as if he were treating his child.

Some of the key points regarding Dr. Kim's practice, which were demonstrated consistently on all of our cares are as follows:

- His treatment approach is just right - his skills are top notch and he does an exceptional job, but never too aggressive.
- He has a great bedside manner. Caring, passionate about his profession, and friendly.
- If you aren't so good with tolerating pain, he makes sure that you don't feel pain during the treatment.
- If you need to see a dentist on weekends, his clinic is open every other Saturday.

Within the past 3+ years of coming to M Dental, we had to wait long(more than 25 min.) few times.  I guess that shows this place is a popular choice by a lot of people.  Try to schedule your appointment on days that they're less busy. The front desk staff are very accommodating.</Text><Name>Young Lee<//Name>< Response>

"Hello, my dear!  It's the tooth fairy.  Time to give your teeth some TLC before I take them from you."

Came in for my regular dental prophylaxis - "cleaning" to the layperson.

Passing time by watching "The Voice" on Hulu, I was quickly seen by staff.  Quick, easy & ouch-free was my prophylaxis.  The face towel draping during procedures really helps w/anxiety & inducing a more relaxed state.

I bit the bullet & went all in for my first ever teeth whitening.  I've always thought "Why would I want to get my teeth whitened?  I never smile :(".  I guess the prospect of looking handsome at Yelp events is what gave me impetus to try it.  I had my dental impression done & will come back in 2 weeks for my dental tray & whitening gel.  So, next time you see me, I may be sporting shiny, new, ultra-brite LED/HID teeth :)

Along w/ a Keurig brewing system, the waiting room now has a Nespresso machine, too.  I thought the Nespresso box w/ the multicolored capsules was a makeup kit LOL.  Very fancy!

The dentists & the staff are always warm & friendly.  I feel happy after having my appointment, because they take great care of my teeth.  Oh, and the free caffeine jolt is a plus, too!

Come for your teeth, stay for the caffeine.

Highly recommend!< /review>

<Review>I strongly recommend M Dental Group not only because of their fancy equipment or decoration, but because I could always feel the doctors' genuine care for the patients. As a patient, it is very important to undertand what kind of treatment I need and how those treatments will procede. Before I went to M Dental I had no clue what treatment I got. Dr. Kim always wantedt to make sure I was ok with each treatment I was getting, and through the multiple visits for my 4 root canal treatment and denture procedures, I completely felt comfortable receiving treaments from the doctor. Also, I appreciated when Dr. Kim showed me the x-rays that were taken before and after the procedure to explain how my condition changed after the treament. If you are looking for a dentist, you should go to M Dental because you're going to love them.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

(Translated by Google) As I think back over this past year, one of the things I’m very grateful for is that I have new strong and pretty teeth. Over the years, I lost all of my upper teeth due to periodontitis, gingivitis and cavities. I relied on dentures for a long time. And then my lower teeth became loose and lower gum started bleeding frequently. I long wished that God would grant me new teeth, and a friend introduced me to Dr. Kim. Meeting Dr. Kim was a miracle. Dr. Kim kindly and thoroughly explained how procedures would be done, so that I won’t fear the process. I was under general anesthesia for the bone graft surgeries and implant surgeries of 6 upper teeth. Everything went well. After one month, 7 lower teeth were implanted. Everything went well. It was a joy to commute to Harbor Blvd from Torrance, where I live, every week for one entire year. I thank Dr. Kim. I also thank Father God.
Now I’m living a golden period of my life, because now I can chew anything and everything!!
Happy Thanksgiving!!

Looking back over the past year, one of the things I've been really grateful for is the appearance of pretty and healthy teeth. I had a mold for a long time because my upper teeth were all missing due to cavities and taste. However, even the lower teeth were shaken and the gums began to bleed a lot. I wished that God would give me new teeth, but with an acquaintance's introduction, Dr. I met Kim. For me, this meeting is a miracle. The teacher kindly explained how to do the surgery so that I was not afraid. I underwent sleep anesthesia and performed bone graft surgery, and the implant surgery on the upper teeth was completed well. After a month, I did a good job of implanting 7 lower teeth. Now I have a perfect and pretty new tooth. I have enjoyed going to the hospital from Torrance to Harbor once a week for a year. Dr. Thank you, Mr. Kim. And I thank Heavenly Father. I am living in the golden age of life now. Because you can chew anything!! Happy Thanksgiving!!

지난 한 해를 돌아보니 정말 감사했던 일 중에 하나는 이쁘고 건강한 이빨이 생긴 것입니다. 저는 충치와 풍치로 윗니가 다 빠져서 오랫동안 틀이를 했습니다. 그런데 아랫니 마저 흔들리고 잇몸에서 피가 많이 나기 시작했습니다. 하나님께 새 이빨을 주시면 좋겠다고 소원했었는데 지인의 소개로 Dr. 김을 만나게 되었습니다. 저에게는 이 만남이 기적입니다. 선생님은 제가 두려워 하지 않도록 친절하게 어떻게 수술할 것인지 잘 설명해 주셨습니다. 수면마취를 해서 뼈 이식수술을 했고 윗니 6개의 임플란트 수술을 잘 마쳤습니다. 한달 뒤에 아랫니 7개의 임플란트 수술도 잘했습니다. 지금은 완벽하고 이쁜 새 이를 가졌습니다. 그동안 토렌스에서 하버까지 일주일에 한번씩 일년동안 병원을 다니는 시간이 참 즐거웠습니다. Dr. 김 선생님께 감사합니다. 그리고 하나님 아버지께 감사드립니다. 저는 지금 인생의 황금기를 살고 있답니다. 무엇이든 씹을 수 있으니까요!! Happy Thanksgiving!!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The inside of the dentist was clean and the doctors were very friendly. In Korea, one of the calibration retainers went off and attached, and they inspected and attached them. I recommend this if you need to go to the dentist for orthodontics

<rating>1</rating><review>Interesting outfit.  They showed up only to proclaime my lock was "unpickable," further stating they had never seen a "Quikset" lock before.  They had to return to their shop for a tool most locksmiths one would think would carry around with them all the time.   Upon their return, the fellow fumbled unartfully with the lock, mumbling something about it wasn't in their "mock-up," which would suggest they were in a learning curve, practicing on, well, "mock-ups."  When I asked them why they left the tool at the shop, the man cited the tool was new.  What I observed in his hand while working on my front doorknob was a bent, heavy guage wire.  You decide.  AAA might be a better bet if you have premium service.<//review><UserId.>116314084839469309992< /UserId.><Gmap_id>0x80ece177d127a54f:0xe3aeebd51908b3df< /Gmap_id><Name>Paula Lawson< /Name>< Response>

They were very rude and inconsiderate to my situation. They hung up on me and didnt refer me when I asked if they knew any other company that might be able to help me. I live in morro bay and would rather buy brand new locks and install them then ever go to this company again...i heard some bad stories about the owner to that I wont repeat but suggest you look elsewhere for service.<//review>

STAY AWAY!! Besides the fact that this place has THE WORST customer service on the planet, they stole my brand new safe and never gave it back. It was supposed to be fixed over the weekend, almost a YEAR AGO, and they keep giving me the run around. The rude guy at the counter offered to swap it out with a rusty one from what looked like a 1950’s type!!!! Take your chances in Santa Maria or Paso for that matter stay away from these thieves!</Text>

I have done business for years with Pacific Locksmiths and they do everything lock related. Recently I came in after talking with the owner who is a great person. When I got there, there were 2 angry elderly couple who were trying to lock the door so I couldn't get in. I called the owner to inform and the owner came right over and they had to have the angry couple removed by the police.

I was very impressed with how they were incredibly patient in the face of the angry people and firm with not letting them bully the girl behind the counter. They then handled my business and I was out of there in minutes. I highly recommend Pacific Locksmiths for all your locksmithing problems</text>

Helped me out of a jam when I forgot the keys to remove the trailer hitch from my truck. The locksmith met me on a Sunday and it took him only a few seconds to get master lock off.  Response time was pretty good.  A big thank you for all of your help.< /text>

Do not go to Pacific Locksmiths unless you have NO OTHER OPTIONS!  The worst experience I've ever had, BY FAR! All the bad reviews about this place are spot on.  I'm really glad that a few people have had positive experiences but unless you have some very simple problem they will not be able to help you.  They are not competent and not professional. The moment they hit a snag in trying to program my new car keys, the "lady" owner was quick to turn around and try to blame my car for the problem.  They were not proactive at all, had my car for over a MONTH and never called me to update me on progress. I always had to call them and when I did the "lady" owner was very rude, with an attitude like I was bothering her. By the end of it all, I had to pay almost $400 for two keys, that were not correctly programmed and tow my car to the dealership. Fortunately the dealership was able to program new keys very quickly (for another $200).  Please learn from my mistake.  Do NOT go to Pacific Locksmiths.< /review>

I've been doing business with Pacific locksmith for a very long time, the rekeyed my personal home, made me keys to my old pickup and my new vehicle as well as made me keys for my trailer they're genuinely courteous for the most part and try to be reasonable on their prices to the people below in bed that are upset about them calling at 11 p.m. at night and asking for an appointment the following day need to really think about courteousness and the fact that you would not call another business that late at night to schedule a next-day appointment unless it's an emergency just because a business states that they're 24 hours does not mean there 24 hours for random stuff it means they're 24 hours for emergency services which is what stated on the side of their vehicles I love this company and how hard they work I will continue to use them and no one else thank you Pacific locksmiths for all the help you've given and will continue to give for many more years<//text>

Went in to ask for a copy of my car key, and the guy who I assumed was working there was just sitting at his computer and said "how can I help you today" without even looking up at me. After I waited for him to look up, I simply asked him for a quote for him to make a copy and he rudely and impatiently asked whether I needed a key with or without something I could barely understand through his mumbling. Wont be coming back</Text>

Even though I was waiting right outside the door when the owner came in and shut the door behind him, he never turned on his open sign or told me I could come in. I waited for 20 minutes as he counted money and did bookkeeping tasks. I was looking in the window and making eye contact. Yet when I finally knocked and he let me in he said "I didnt know you were waiting for me, I have been open this whole time." Jeesh! So when we finally get to business it turns out he can not help me with my locksmith need, even though I called days earlier and was assured that my problem is a simple and easy task that their business does all the time. Apairantly the worker told me the complete opposite than the reality. Epic fail!<//review>

My 86 year old dad calls me at 8:30 PM saying he's locked out of his house, has lost his flashlight, the spare key is missing and all the windows are locked. Unbelievably, I realize that I loaned my spare key to my sister and it's now out of state! Knowing it'd do no good for me to drive from Los Osos to Atascadero to help my dad get in (short of breaking a window), I picked up the phone.

EVERY LOCKSMITH IN THE NORTH COUNTY DIDN'T ANSWER THEIR PHONE. EXCEPT ONE: Pacific Locksmiths. (Two hours later as I write this, NOT A SINGLE OTHER LOCKSMITH HAS RETURNED MY CALL).

The woman at Pacific Locksmiths who answered the phone was one of the owners--NOT some after hours answering service--she was extremely courteous, kind & gracious--she took down all the pertinent details, provided an ETA window, and closed the phone call with: "Don't worry, your father is in safe hands--we'll take good care of him."

They rolled out from Morro Bay to Atascadero at the drop of a hat! Forty minutes later my Ol' Man called from his Lazy Boy to let me know he was back inside, warm & safe.

I think that pretty much sums it up. Thanks a million, Pacific Locksmiths. You have our business for life. :)</Review>

Would rate zero stars if it were an option. My son lost the keys to his car a few days ago. His car is older and he had been having trouble with the ignition cylinder lock. I thought that this would be a good time to purchase a replacement since the part comes with new keys.
I called Pacific Locksmiths to see about getting the keys programmed. Wow ! What an awful experience.

I spoke with a woman who was rude and immediatly accusatory. Instead of informing me that I would need to demonstrate proof of ownership or that isn't a service they provide, she decided to play some sort of weird detective game with me.

She asked  "why don't you have the keys?" I told her they were lost.  She then said, "the door locks won't match the ignition". I let her know that wouldn't be a problem because we had a spare door key. Lastly, she said "we don't work with backyard mechanics". (Whatever that means).

Seem's to me that a professionsl  locksmith would be able to have a pleasant discussion regarding their services.

Called Toyota dealership. No wierd detective games, no problems. So much for trying to support a local small business.<//text>

While I agree with many reviews here about the demeanor and overall customer service skills of the employees I have to say I left very happy. I bought a Ford fusion 2 days ago and it only had 1 key. Well Ford has a system on some cars that lets you assign parental controls to a key, and guess which key I got? To remove or override this system you need 2 keys, one without the controls. For the dealership to override they still need 2 keys. The best the dealership (or any Ford dealer within 45 mins) is $360+ tax and 2-3 days. I needed it same day as I don't live in the area. So I needed someone with my specific electronic key in stock, who can laser cut, and has the programming equipment to program the key to work with my car. Pacific Locksmith was the ONLY locksmith in the central coast available to help me. And I called them all. They were able to have someone meet me at the storefront in Morro Bay within 45 mins. (It's not always open so be sure to call) it did take nearly 2.5 hours because he had to go retrieve a different programing device and update that. But he was able to complete the job, I was able to remove the parental controls the previous owner had put on the car, and my total bill? $235. Over $100 less than the best price from a Ford dealer. The key isn't a generic key like I expected, it's an actual OEM key from Ford.

So while they could definitely benefit from a lesson in manners, hygiene and customer service, I am still a very satisfied customer and would still recommend as they were the only ones within 50 miles able to do the job, and at a reasonable price.</text>

I was driving when pink pacific locksmiths truck with a man and woman in it decided to cut me and multiple other cars off at the last second to get off the freeway, forcing people to slam on their brakes. They then proceeded to cuss at me and flip me off.
This baffled me as they were driving illegally on the shoulder and had the audacity to think I did something wrong.
If they have this bad of a attitude while driving a company vehicle on public streets imagine how little they would care about working for you.
I would not touch these idiots with a ten foot pole.< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>I too would rate this place with zero stars if it was an option. The secretary that answers calls is completely rude and disrespectful. She acts like shes a police detective, who is not trying to help you but is trying to prove you are in the wrong. A technician came out and programmed a key for one of my cars. At first, it worked fine, but about a month later it stopped working, and put my car into anti theft mode.

I called them back after i figured out that it was the key causing the problem. The rude woman once again answered the phone and she told me that she would charge me a couple hundred to send a tech out, who MAY be able to fix the problem. If they failed, i would still have to pay and still not be able to drive my car.

Luckily, my boyfriend and I were able to use a saved profile of my car that we had downloaded on my laptop a long time ago, and erase the new key. l'll still need a new one but i will never ever use this locksmith again, I cannot believe they are AAA approved.</review>< date>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Called Pacific Locksmith this morning, 5/8, and politely asked the woman who answered about their policy on a door lock and handle their workman installed for us, for $90, 1/30, because it hadn't been working properly for some time.   Answer by woman (with belligerent, rough voice) "You realize this is May, right?."  Me:  "Yes, what is your policy for further help if we find it wasn't installed correctly please?".  Woman:  "We aren't responsible for equipment, and you will have to pay a $90 trip charge."
Me:  "What if we find it was installation, what will be the charge please?"
Woman (raising voice) "I said $90".  Me:  "Okay, you sound belligerent and are having a bad day, and your company does not seem to have a customer service policy".  Woman...begins to argue, angry words streaming out of phone....I wish her a nice day, and hang up.  Wow.
Why are you still in business?

< review>
I called at 11:50pm to attempt and schedule an appointment for tomorrow morning since my front door just completely locked on me. The lady answered me and asked me, "you're calling me at midnight to schedule in appointment for TOMORROW?" I answered, "well, yes I'd like to know if that's a possibility.." next thing I hear is a click. SHE HUNG UP ON ME. Does she know her website states she's open 24/7? Why would she be upset that I called within her business hours? I've never been so disrespected in my entire life. I was just trying to schedule an apt ahead of time to not inconvenience THEIR employees. I will not be using this business EVER and make sure no one I know in the Morro Bay Area does either.<//review>

<Review>All the reviews are 100% accurate. The lady who owns the company and the man who works for her are completely rude and unprofessional. After being yelled at her for following up on locks I assumed were ordered by her company she told me there are plenty of other locksmiths I could call. She then hung up on me. I had the phone on speaker phone so my husband could hear the way she was talking to me. I have no idea how this company can remain in business and treat their customers with such disrespect. Very unfortunate.< /Review>< Pictures>

It's a fine place, I personally feel that a lot if people here are very nice but the owners here don't really care about it too much because there is litterally a house that has water in front of it and if it isn't fixed soon it could start sinking so I think maybe a different place< /review>

Have you been abiding by the new California and nationwide mobile home laws? if not, then be prepared for a request of 800 million from all tenants who have been evicted, or have lived in the park for ten years prior to the illegal ten year lease agreement we are bound by since 2014 whether we signed or not. MY Qualifications will be soon recognized as appropriate for this conclusion. Your corporation wil soon know every detail of your abuse on not only mine, but others nation wide in your attempt to illegally aquire the older homes disabled people have inherited by jacking the price up 65% in this agreement basing the price on a neighborhood tha tis in my case 120 miles from m y own home <that was stolena and not compensated for 798.56 a to be thrown in the trash to make way for a new mobioeo home 798.58 and the mobile home park makes profit by selling it 798.17, no thats something else you violated such as waiving our chapter 2.5 rights. Anyone who falls under these two categories are the beneficiaries of this action.  since the 10 year lease agreement has become a forged document leading to the acquisition of property . i am in no way nor is this this any way a threat, but a request before proceedings begin.  SInce i have graduated with an average 3.8 to 4.0 gpa in SCIENCE while your managment prevented me from completing my last four classs < injury using police by telling lies about my behavior>  and intimidation preventing me from leaving my own home or hiding somewhere near but away from my home because i felt in danger of the manager he was chasing and attcking me not the other way around...his witnesses are convoluded and thieves guilty of prostitution burglary and violence and own guns >
Due to the nature of the status of my own harassment, my life is in danger if i reveal my actual identity.  must be hidden.  i must be brief. any lack of understanding of this communication is only due to your own incompetence or unwillingness to understand. I have earned top grades in my classes and the only thing that impaeres my life is having my home stolen after being physically mentally verbally and emotionally abused by your own management. I have my own witnesses and was never given due process. they just listened to lies. the judge admitted that creekside estates was telling lies
i can prove that april 3 2015 incident was all creeksides fault the office called that day to the police saying i was a threat. chpd now have noted i was never a threat
i have been harmed by their attack on me and harmed by creeksides relentless harassment that i am out of a home homeless and my lively hood ruined.  creekside used the police against me in a game.
If you misquote this statement in anyway then you are  guilty of perjury. I will repeat the same mesasage to several so that we all know it is clear. i am real. i am injured i am above manipulation, i am a college graduate more intelligent than you can imagine, i save spiders because they keep away the ants so i dont have to kill  an ant; i am no danger to anyone who has not threatened me, because womans defense classes are tough  I will publish this far and wide, so misquoting me is not an intelligent idea.</Text>

<text>Not the best place to live. Roads need fixing. Ever time it rain you could go swimming in the pot holds that are all over the park. The rent is way to high for the small lots and NO security at all.</text>< pics>

<Review>We eat at Sinbad's for special occasions and when entertaining out of area friends and/or family.  The location is perfect: just about a block from the Embarcadero BART station, right where the ferries arrive, and if you drive a car they have valet parking right outside the door.  The view of the Bay Bridge light show is amazing and the boat traffic outside the large windows just screams "San Francisco."

The food is quite good.  I think there are some places around where you can get a somewhat better meal, but they are hard to get to and don't have the view. Sinbad's staff is welcoming and friendly and they handle (well-behaved) children well.</Review><user>117984664990482388590</user><Name>George Martin<//Name>< Response>

Spectacular view. The bay view and lighted bridge is spectacular. My steak was tender, juicy and cooked perfect. My date said her clam chowder soup was delicious. Overall it was a nice and romantic dinner.< /Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>We went there at 3pm, so the whole restaurant was calm. The service was very friendly and welcoming. We were served promptly, with a plate of Cajun swordfish (not too spicy at all !) and the chef combination of seafood (shrimp, crab and salmon).
Both were very good, and we ended that with a slice of homemade apple pie and two cup of fresh coffee.
The outside is not that beautiful, but the view on the SF-Oakland Bay bridge from the inside really makes it!< /text>< rating>

My husband and I decided to eat here after a few nights in San Francisco to have some seafood. We read the reviews and were convinced that it would be good. My husband had a salmon and shrimp scampi dish with a dinner salad and I had the scallops with a dinner salad. The dinner salads were about $10 for a plate full of iceberg lettuce and our main dishes left much to be desired for what we paid. We think that we could have gotten better quality and quantity seafood at Red Lobster for less. I suggest you go down the Marina to Joe's Crab Shack and get better food and pay less. The restaurant itself was old and dated. The restrooms were disgusting. Had I used it before dinner, we probably wouldn't have stayed.</Text>

I'm only giving 1 star because I can't give less. I could tell from the outside that this place was very bad. (I was made to go in). It looks very rundown and need some work on the outside. The inside is even worse. Brown cork on the ceilings that is hanging off. Very old and unclean looking. I ordered the red snapper with fries. Everything on the plate was bad. The fries had not been cooked. WARNING STAY AWAY.</Review>

It's almost impossible to beat the view if you like being on the waterfront.  The Bay Lights shine on the water at night and it's a show.  Regarding the bar... the drinks are served by the bottle (no specialty brews or craft beers) and that makes for reasonable prices compared to most bars in SF.  Regarding the restaurant... the clam chowder is a crowd favorite and not to be skipped.<//text>

What a nice dining experience we had at Sinbads last night with my family. The host put us at a nice window view table right on the bay with an amazing view of the Bay Bridge. I ordered the sea bass and it was the best fish dinner I've ever had. The kids and my wife's food was very satisfying as well. It's a landmark restaurant all the way and deservedly so.</Review>

Then a group of storks perched in a planter box in front of our table.  Kids were excited as well as us.  Eggs Benedict was the best I've ever had.  Kids menu perfect for my kids.

<name>SUSAN T<//name><Date>1374117949874< /Date><text>Not only is the food bad but the restaurant is dirty. Dust on the wood trim of the chairs, I noticed crumbs/food under the two tables next to ours. Our tablecloth was stained.   Woman's restroom sink and soap dispenser were filthy. I went for lunch. Blackened swordfish was so spicy I could not eat it. Clam chowder was sweet. Water for tea was not hot. I am a San Francisco native. I remember going to Sinbads for my senior prom and many times over the years when the food was good and people waited up to an hour to be seated. It did not take long to figure out why there was only one other person in the restaurant. Positive reviews on the restaurant, the view and the service. Both are excellent. This restaurant should be closed for repairs, cleaning  and a new cook.< /text><response>None</response>< user>

The food is certainly good - the menu is old-fashioned, but "classic" instead of "outdated".  I'm especially pleased that I tried the French onion soup.

What really impressed us, though, was the impeccable, kind service, especially as we were traveling with a rambunctious, hungry toddler. The staff is to be commended.< /review>

<Time>1389732650435</Time><rate>1< /rate><Text>I had reservations, they lost them. Even though I showed them  the email confirmation they sent me After that they made me wait 45 minutes to be seated, keep in mind the restaurant was empty. It has to be the worst service I've ever had in my life, I can't even make this up. We were a party of 6, after waiting 40 minutes for appetizers they told us they were out of three different types of soups ..
After a 20 minutes of a game of where's our waiter they found him later to take the food order .. The steaks  we ordered medium well  came out rare we sent them Back they came back chopped looking like dog food and tasted like shoe leather We asked for the mgr and came over and informed us the waiter was new and did not know what he was doing Really ..... When my wife complained he  told her she was classy in front of my four children we ask for the bill to get out of the worst meal of our life was another 20 minutes adventure it came out on a piece of  paper that look liked hieroglyphics and after the rewrite amazingly it was $70 less......

<text>It was simply terrible.  The place looks like it hasn't been cleaned or cared for since 1982.  Carpets were gross.  The view of the bridge was spoiled by the filthy windows and dead flowers just outside.  Food was marginal at best.  Virtually every other option in San Francisco would have been a better choice.  I was embarrassed that I took a woman there.</text>< Gmap_id>

Appeal = WEIRD. If you are 1) looking for a place that is best visited with the lights off, 2) in the mood to be yelled at with the most polite intentions by a crazy Chinese waiter, 3) want to be horrified by the "stuffed" Sinbad figurine that "welcomes" you when you enter, 4) totally planning on not using the restroom during your visit, and 5) looking for advice on what complications may arise during a natural child birth THEN this place is totally for you. Oh, and the food isn't great but decent (the Cajun salmon was actually delicious). You do get a killer view of the Bay Bridge.< /review>

Kaboom!  Girls had a great time celebrating our girls birthday at Sinbad's.  Drank on their outdoor patio on the water.  No better place to get away with that  amazing ocean view.  Sinbad's is the best.< /review>

Good ole Sinbad's is a San Francisco icon. No one has a view of the bay bridge light show like Sinbad's. Place is old San Francisco Food is good and the view is the best bar none.<//review>

<Review>Concierge at Hyatt recommended me to take my wife to Sinbad's before we go back home to Denver. It was our best experience during our weeks stay no restaurant can match the view and food. We return next year.< /Review>< GmapID>

So I was in San Francisco for the first time ever visiting family and wanted to try some of the world famous food that everyone kept telling me about. Made reservations for this place and had what might of been the worst restaurant experience of my life. The place looks very rundown and old. It has a certain musty smell. The one positive is that the view from the restaurant is amazing. Due to this, we asked to be seated outside, even though there weren't any other people seated outside. This proved to be a mistake, as we sat there for over an hour without even having a waiter come by. Not for drinks or anything. We asked a waiter if we could get someone to come by and he responded very rudely. Eventually, I went in and asked the host to send a waiter out, and was again treated very rudely. We finally had a waiter come by and were able to get a drink order in. It took another hour for us to get our food. I was extremely disappointed. From the chalky, pasty, flavorless crab cake appetizer, to the over seasoned, greasy, mushy swordfish with over cooked vegetables. This place is ridiculously over priced for the quality of food you are getting. I have had better food at dive bars. Looked up some more reviews, it this is one of the worst rated restaurants in the whole city. I look forward to trying some real food next time I am in SF. Avoid at all costs. Go anywhere in SF but here.</review>

<Text>The menus were dirty. The tablecloths were old. The waitstaff couldn't remember my drink order and insisted I take something I didn't ask for. The waiter spilled my water on the table and didn't bring a replacement. The waitress taking orders didn't know what was in the mixed vegetables. The ribeye steak I ordered was not the best meat and tasted like it was cooked on a grill that hadn't been cleaned in quite a while. I couldn't eat it. On top of it all, the prices were very high.< /Text>< Pics>

I shouldn't even give this restaurant one star. The food was terrible, bread was stale, extremely over priced menu! This experience was Very disappointing. I have had better food at Applebee's for half the price. My husband used the restroom before we left and one window was held up with a butter knife, and the other with a straw. I have no idea how this restaurant stays in business. Such a waste of money.<//Review>

Took my gal to Sinbads for Valentines dinner. Host was very friendly on greeting us and gave us a great table on the bay with an amazing view of the lighted bay bridge. Our waiter Jace was very funny and gave us great service.  Place is old but in a good way. I had the captain's seafood combination and it was delicious. My gal ordered the wild swordfish and it was very fresh. The finisher, chocolate cake was the best yet. Had a nice experience.<//Review>

<Text>Nice view of the bay and friendly service, but the food was no better than what you could get from Captain D's. My wife and I were very disappointed in our food. We expected much better. The salad was wilted and over drenched in dressing, the vegetables were over cooked and the Halibut was no better than what one can get in the mid-West.< /Text><user_id>104224789419984509339< /user_id>< response>

2018 update:  Sinbad’s is no more. Closed and demolished. Long live Sinbads

this place is just weird.  The staff is weird, the food is so-so, the clientele is weird, and the atmosphere is... weird.  And not in an interesting way.  Its a throwback to old-school wharfy seafood grotto with a touch of what was in 1970s san francisco considered class.   I want so badly to like it, and think of it as an old classic, but i think it needs to go.  Been there three times and each time the staff put me off so much that its killed it for me.  Food is pricey, not worth it.

too bad.< /text>

Expensive food, nothing fancy. Most sides are a few new potatoes and veggies. You get an adequate portion of seafood but it's nothing outstanding. Dinner for two with a drink costs 90$.< /Review>

Where I come from there's no view like Sinbads, all there is is flat land and barren trees. Really enjoyed the change Sinbads had, seafood was so fresh. Want to return to San Francisco and Sinbads.< /Text>

If you go to Sinbad's, prepare to step into a time machine that takes you back to the 70s and 80s.    The ceiling is dark cork, the checks are all hand-written, the lightbulbs are all incandescent and even the music was retro.  Seriously, they were playing the Carpenters and the BeeGees the whole evening we were there.  The debate after dinner was about whether the dated-ness is accidental or an intentional theme.   But if you're o.k. with that, you're in for a good dining experience.  The view was great, and the food was well-executed and very high quality, though hardly innovative.  For example, the dessert menu features chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream and for the most exotic offering, Cherries Jubilee.  But the ice cream, cake, and Jubilee were all delicious. The service was good, too.  The whole staff were an experienced bunch who were a well-oiled machine.  The prices were high, but understandably so, considering the location.<//review>

< Review>
I came here with a groupon. I would like to say almost everyone around my girlfriend and I had a groupon. I didn't see anyone actually coming to this restaurant because they wanted to go. However, the food was ok for being an luxurious tasting restaurant. My girlfriend got the lobster and I got steak. I was really full from the meal and took the blueberry cheesecake home. The dessert was actually the highlight of my meal. I will probably not come back unless someone had a groupon.</Review>

Fair warning. They should be ashamed of their spaghetti, and my chicken sandwich tasted like a fish sandwich. Overpriced for what was basically unedible. Nice view at least...< /review>

Very disappointed. Scallops were overcooked and covered with seasoning salt. It was awful. The bread was under baked and bland. Dinner for family of five was over $200. Not sure how they stay in business.<//text>

Taxi driver was right, best dinner house in San Francisco.  Bay bridge light show is amazing and the view from Sinbads captures all the visual effects like a movie theatre.  I ordered the seabass and it must of come straight from the fishing boat it was so fresh.  Wife ordered the salmon florentine and it was equally as good.  Shared chocolate cake and it was the best ever.  Great Job Sinbads.</Text>

On top of cold served london broil the wait staff was absolutely the ruddest I've encountered. The waiters run by asking if everything's okay, which I can see why they run, because they know their food and service is horrible they just dont want to hear about it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME. There are much better restaurants with a 1 minute walk.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

the staff is nice but all the rest is a no-go: the restaurant itself looks pretty old and bad maintained. it is pretty pricey but the food quality is below average. calamari were gummy, the shrimp salad tasteless. just go somewhere else, there are nicer restaurants around.<//review>

(Translated by Google) We follow a recommendation from a traveler site as the best place to see New Year's Eve fireworks.

We booked online through Open Table and arrived by taxi, they immediately placed us at our table.

The restaurant had a magnificent view of the bay and was ideal for a New Year's dinner (New Year's dinner had a fixed price and the menu a previous selection of dishes).

Really the place was unbeatable, the food very tasty and very good attention.

Note: The return to the hotel was exhausting, half San Francisco was on the street. It was necessary to move twelve blocks away from the crowd to get a taxi.

Seguimos una recomendación de un sitio de viajeros como el mejor lugar para ver los fuegos artificiales de fin año nuevo.

Hicimos la reserva on line a través de Open Table y llegamos en taxi, inmediatamente nos ubicaron en nuestra mesa.

El restorán tenía una magnifica vista de la bahía y era ideal para la cena de año nuevo (la cena de año nuevo tenía un precio fijo y el menú una selección previa de platos).

Realmente el lugar era inmejorable, la comida muy sabrosa y muy buena la atención.

Nota: El regreso al hotel fue agotador, medio San Francisco estaba en la calle. Hubo que alejarse doce cuadras entre la multitud para conseguir un taxi.<//Text>

<text>Absolutely love this little ballpark in the heart of Stockton! Used to be the home of the Stockton Ports and now it is used for other baseball games. Amazing atmosphere and excellent location to make great family memories. If you have a chance to watch a game here, I highly recommend it! Can't beat the feeling of nostalgia on a warm summer night!<//text></record></dataset><record>

The girls are great to play on, if I had to be critical it on anything it would be on the bathrooms and the minimal food options at the snack bar. The snack bar is still fine, it has basics to get you through but the the staff are really friendly.< /review>

I've gone here to watch Stockton Ports baseball. Very nice little Stadium and each seat has a great View. Pretty good view from center field grass. Vendor Food is decent and varied. Restaurant food is better. Good family atmosphere. Hours vary depending upon game times throughout the week, mostly on weekends. Good promotions.< /review>

Ok
I found the field in good shape.  It was my first visit.  I was surprised how good a shape the bath room was in.

It is refreshing when you find a business in your area that you are willing to recommend. I highly recommend this shop. They have fair pricing and quick service. I'm very impressed with Best Muffler.< /review>

I bought an aftermarket exhaust from AWE. Upon assembly, i discovered one of the exhaust pipe ends was not expanded and slotted for a proper connection. I brought it down to Best Muffler and they set me straight. I offered to pay a fee and the owner told me not to even worry about it. I didn't expect that. In addition to that, the fitment was superb. I never caught the gentleman's name, but thanks again for your service.<//text>

<Text>Took my car in to swap stock exhaust with a high quality cat back exhaust. Job was done quickly which  was good however at the cost of quality. After the job on my way home there was a loud viabration/drone which i figured was from the exhaust even though it advertised a drone free experience. It got progressively worse so I looked under my car and 3 bolts for the crossmember were hanging on by a few threads while 1 was missing altogether. I tightened them and 90% of the drone was gone. Fast forward a few weeks during an at home oil change I notice water coming from one of the connection clamps when warming up the car indicating a leak in the exhaust (not severe enough to cause a check engine light though). Turns out all 4 clamps were not torqued to spec but pretty loose. After tightening all clamps to spec there is now no drone as advertised from the cat back manufacturer.

Message to business: please double check work before giving the car back to the customer.

Giving two stars because they were able to remove a stripped nut preventing the swap to be a relatively simple diy project.

Tl;dr: quick service but poor quality. most nuts and bolts were loose causing product to not function completely as advertised.

Edit: would like to add that prices were reasonable< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

<review>These guys are some of the best at what they do. Got a muffler delete for my  2010 Volkswagen GTI and they did spectacular. Clean welds, clean exhaust, clean exhaust tips, and even helped me out by repairing one of the hangers for the resonator.

The people there are very friendly and welcoming. Felt right at home while waiting for my car. Highly recommend if your looking for repairs and custom exhuast systems.</review><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

I was referred to "Best Muffler", by Auto Aide.   They have always given me A-1 care, but referring me to Best Muffler was by far the best thing that has happened to me in a long time!   They put a catalyst converter in my car, for less than half the price of the other repair shops!   They also gave me deals on other services, I needed.  They ARE the best!<//review>

One star for customer service, and five stars for the work.

I’ve known Eddie for years, he’s done lots of work on my truck and Jeep. I had something come up recently with my truck, I needed his help. I live 100 miles away, so I couldn’t just stop by. I called multiple times and left messages. I was promised he’d call back, and he never did. Very disappointing. He obviously doesn’t need my business anymore. The guy does great work, when you can get ahold of him.<//review>

The phone was answered by the business owner Eddie, he gave me an acceptable estimate, so I drove the 20 miles to take my motorhome to them.
I knew I needed new mufflers, and as I'm trying to get it smog checked, I had been told I would need a catalytic converter as well. Well Eddie was really honest and affordable, he told me I didn't need the cat., as he had asked the smog check station next door, and my motorhome was ready 4 hours later, with two new mufflers and a much quieter ride, at under $200.00!! I'm so glad I found out about them! I've even recommended them to a friend of mine!<//Review>< Pics>

Talk to Eddie on anything you need on your car regarding exhaust system in your car.. He will get it done.. If its just factory or custom work he will work with you!! It's not too expensive either compared to other shops!!<//Text>

I highly recommend this place. One of the best experiences, as a woman, I have had taking my car into the shop. They were helpful they found the problem right away they ordered the part I cannot recommend this place more highly. Thank you so much I cannot tell you how much the Finn family appreciates you fixing the van thank you.< /Review>

Flexible and very courteous.  As a walk-in, I had my muffler changed in less than 45 minutes.  It is absolutely apparent that these folks don't try to rip off their customers.  Very satisfied.  If the need arises, I'm definitely going back to Best Mufflers.</text>

Best muffler shop in ALL of the inland empire. I have taken my all my cars to them and not once have they let me down. Top quality work at very affordable prices. Eddie even stayed 2 hours after closing to squeeze me in for custom exhaust work on my 350z. A++++. They also offer tig welding and stainless steal for the ultimate custom exhaust system you are looking for.< /Review>

If I could give this place a 0 star I would!! I took my Mustang in here and had flow masters put on it. I had Maga a flows on there but had a hole so I paid this shop 400 bucks to put these on for me all I asked is that they save my old mufflers for me. It took them twice as long as they originally told me but I didn’t mind I just wanted it done right.  So I got a ride home came back the next day as they requested got there my car still wasn’t ready. I waited their for a couple hours and finally said to them hey I’m going to be late to work so they started working on my vehicle. After they finally finished I asked where my old mufflers are and I was told the scrap guy picked them up. They said they get them  all the time they will give me another set. I have stopped by the shop 2 times had my bf stop once and they said they will call. It has been at least 6 months now and still nothing. Those mufflers came off my car I paid for them as well as 400 for the new mufflers I said I wanted them before my car even went up on the rack. As  I see it that is very poor customer service. I would not take my car to this place.</review>

This is by far the best muffler shop in Riverside county. Honest, affordable and very quality work. He fixed my exhaust and fabbed the parts necessary to complete it. Absolutely hands down some of the highest quality work!</Text>

We use Eddie for our custom builds here at the shop. He does amazing custom work, and builds us some of the best custom setups. Most of the time our customers want something different, and want mandrel bent/stainless/TIG setups. Best pricing and quality. Thank you!< /text>

He asked for my approval on all the steps of hanging my new muffler. The mufflers sound great and look even better. I am so happy with the job that I had to tell the world.

Best Muffler took my '04 Mustang GT and installed two Pypes M80 mufflers I'd purchased from American Muscle in a little more than an hour, creating that modern Mustang growl I've been searching for.  Another shop, well known in Hemet, tried to bait and switch me, saying it couldn't be done and I'd need to buy far more expensive mufflers and tips from them!  Wrong! Eddie and his staff not only did the job, they did it for far less and probably did a much better job including better tips for far less cash our of pocket!  I was told by the other shop, (quite rudely I might add), to "Next time, let the professionals handle it" after they pop poo'ed my Pypes mufflers. So, I followed their advice.  I took my Mustang to Best Muffler!!!  My car sounds awesome!</review>

Great experience! Eddie was awesome!

They ordered the muffler I needed and despite having a lift down they still were able tosqueezed me in to their schedule so that I could get in get out and go get smogged.

Great mechanics are rare, ones that communicate well even moreso, so be sure to give them a call when your in need of things done right!

Thanks!!!!!<//Text>

I had a super great experience at Ten Tigers. I just got my first nose piercing, and Gary was amazing and super helpful. He’s super confident in his judgement and very thorough with explaining aftercare and the healing process. He was also very welcoming of questions and concerns. It was quite clear to me that they have a lot of experience in what they do, and there’s no doubt I’ll be going back for more.</Text>

Didn't catch the name of the piercer, but I took my sister here for her first PROFESSIONAL piercing [finally!] and we were so happy. She loved her experience and the cost was great. Thank you again!<//Review>

Great experience! Never had a piercing before and they definitely were patient and helped calm the nerves. Tori was great! Super nice and professional. She did a great job making me feel comfortable and getting my piercing done exactly how I wanted it. Props on the covid protocols! They are not messing around with this pandemic. Great job guys!</text>

I took my 17 year old to get her nose pierced and you do need your child birth certificate to sign off on a minor. No exceptions!! No I forgot it at home, it's ok, you can come back with it. So don't even try it, just bring the paperwork.<//Text>

Got my bridge pierced here by Tori. She did a perfect job and explained her entire process really thoroughly. I wear glasses and was nervous about it, but she walked through it with me and made sure I would be okay to wear them during healing.

The shop is beautiful and clean, and in a great spot. There is no pretentiousness here and I am likely to come back and only get jewelry here to support her!<//Review>

This place is wonderful. It is obviously that genuinely to do best by their customers and care about my well being and satisfaction with their work and my choices while staying responsible with using best practices and making sure they have ny well-informed consent.
I feel very comfortable going here for return visits specifically as a gay trans woman as well.<//Review>

As professional and friendly and conscientious as it gets. There is a real warmth and authenticity to this place that’s hard to describe. I’ve been to several different Bay Area piercing places over the years and this is the one that really feels like the home I’ll keep coming back to.< /Review>

Tori is wonderful and helpful, I really enjoyed going to her each time I have stretched my love piercings. Only gripe I have is that she is a little inconsistent with her open hours. Many times I have come and the sign says open and yet the door is locked. Very frustrating.<//Review>

One of my Favorite Shops in San Francisco to capture a Unique Addition to my jewelry Obsession. Just aquired an amazing piece by MAYA JEWELRY as seen on Beyonce` during her performance on The Grammy stage. Not to mention, a San Francisco-based artist. Hashtag PERFECTION. Definitely returning to Ten Tigers in the Castro. Thank you Tori & Ben for offering a Great Statement Piece. ¡Namaste!<//review>

<Review>I have purchased tires for two of my Honda's at Quinlan's and could not be happier. Aron's recommendations have been wonderful and have completely change the driving character of my cars. They are much quitter now and I am very happy. Even though this is a place where buses, farm equipment and big rigs come for their tires the selection for cars is huge. The prices are the best I have seen. I highly recommend them.</Review><rating>5</rating>< pictures>

<text>Sent an email with some questions regarding some old piercings I had done at another place that needed to be rearranged. I also was going to buy some labrets. Never heard back from them and it's been almost a week. Won't ever go there if that's how they treat prospective clients. Contacted another place in another state, for crying out loud. Got a response within a day and the labrets I ordered arrived within three days. Now that's sevice.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c2bb78a20b9ee3:0xc48972fd4377f8db<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I got all my facial piercings here — PHENOMENAL service but make sure you SPEAK UP about what you want. You will get EXACTLY what you want if you properly speak up about it. Don’t shy away from properly explaining where you want your placement to be. You NEED to let them know when they ask you to elaborate.<//Review>< user>

<Text>I was helped by a trainee and ended up with lots of wrong information.

First the trainee said that I could swap out my jewelry free of charge if I didn’t like what I’d picked out (I was indecisive about a few pieces)

Then the trainee gave me incorrect information about the backings and their size.

And finally one of the earrings fell out within a couple weeks of the piercing (nothing got snagged, just improperly put in when I was pierced)

After speaking to the owner, he essentially blamed me for taking the trainees word as fact and said that I’m responsible for a trainees incorrect information.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I had my nose pierced here and had a great experience. The piercer was knowledgable and professional. The jewelry was expensive, but I've been really happy with the quality. They had a lot of options and I LOVE the piece I selected. I got mine done over a month ago and have had no issues.</Text>

<Text>Shawna pierced my nose. Awesome job! She was very gentle and quick. Would highly recommend this spot! A lot of jewelry choices as well. I was nervous at first but the staff was so professional and informative, i was immediately put as ease. This may be shallow but it helped my mind to see piercers that actually have piercings....I don't know why but it's validating. Almost like having a lifeguard that never gets in the water...you know that they must've passed the test to become a lifeguard but have they demonstrated their knowledge in front of other lifeguards???....if not trust me...they are not respected.  I know...long explanation but it rings true for me when getting pierced!!😉ijs< /Text><pics>None</pics></record>

If you're okay to pay a little more then I definitely recommend this place for the service. I've been here twice, both the brasilian piercer and the son of the owner were very friendly and helpful. Answered all questions and were calming and professional when it came to piercing/changing the piercing.</review>

The girl started talking to us didn’t have enough knowledge for toddler earpieces. When I asked more questions about material and sizes she wasn’t happy about me questioning. In addition, she quoted us double the price of other locations.
When we asked if they can get both ears done at the same time, she said NO! The location near where I live said YES absolutely possible to get both ears done at the same time.
Got unpleasant experience at this location!
Go to Redondo Beach. They are extremely friendly and know what they are doing and have more variety.</review>

Excellent customer service. They are also very professional here. I have several piercing and have never been assessed and measured before being pierced like this. They really look at your body anatomy before  piercing you. Excellent care and service. They even ask you to come back for a 1 month follow up appointment if possible at no extra charge. I will definately be coming back as a repeat customer.<//text>

<review>I called ahead of showing up to make sure the facilities were wheelchair friendly and whether I needed to make an appointment before I came in. I brought my husband along so he could see how ear piercings go when they don't use a piercing gun. Penny was amazing and got me set up with a set of captured bead rings in my tertiary piercings that had healed back over three years ago, and tapered my secondaries to make sure they were clear to go. I was able to stay in my wheelchair and not transfer over, which was great. I loved the atmosphere that the workers were curating, and I absolutely feel comfortable leaving my husband who has ASD in their capable hands should he choose to return on his own time.<//review>< Date>

I went here to get my earlobes pierced and it was very quick and painless. The piercer was also very nice and professional. However, only downside is that it is a bit pricey. Overall I'd recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

<text>Friendly staff but stupidly overpriced. $12 to take a piercing OUT? Not even a swap, literally just taking them out because I couldn’t do it myself. Was in the chair for all of 90 seconds. All the staff were lovely but I wouldn’t come here again because the prices are sky high.<//text>< pics>

Expensive jewelry. The pierciers are friendly and do a good job although they don't all seem to have the same amount of experience. The peircier I had did a great job and the one who did my follown up seemed to be less knowledgeable.  I'd probably come back for a piercing with the same person but not to just buy jewelry.<//text>

< Review>
Didn't have great luck here. The son of the owner was great it was my first piercing ever so I don't know much about the process. My ear was pierced and I was told I was getting a long stick/rod (not sure what it's called) through my ear with the stone I chose at the end (total about $90). I was told i had to get the extra long rod because my ear may swell during the healing process and that I could come back in two month and get the shorter rod once theres no swelling. I came back 2 months later and the father/owner was there. I felt like I was being treated with a short abrasive tone as he told me we don't switch to shorter rods for free that'll cost you an additional $20 or $25 dollars. He also began to make me feel as if I was lying stating that his son would have never said that. It's not even about the extra money... I mean I make a good living and I live in the immediate neighborhood, it's about the way I was spoken to. I've gone to my barber for help since he referred me to this place, because the rod is so tight and neither of us can even get the earring to untwist. Just be honest up front with people about prices otherwise it comes off as desperate and makes one wonder what else you may be doing that is questionable. I mean I could have even bought another color stone just to get the shorter rod, but the energy was foul.< /Review>

Got my septum done here. Penny was the one who did it, she was very kind and seemed to know just what level she wanted the septum for my nose. This place was honestly a lot cheaper than other places Ive looked. All my friends said this would be $100 if not more and Mine was just $75.
They were all so funny and joking around, it really helped relax me as they stabbed a needle through my sternum.<//Text>

<Review>Owner is rude. They used a hoop way too small for the piercing without letting me know and against my request. Avoid both locations.< /Review>< Pics>

The size/diameter is based on your individual anatomy and varies from person to person.  The studios standards is we oversize hoops for all initial piercings due to swelling no matter how much we oversize the jewelry, some people swell more or less and that’s why we have a one month check up and advise to contact us if any issues arise via email, phone or stopping in anytime during business hours 12-8:30pm daily.  I welcome you to contact me directly and see how I can help you and your experience with us.\nEmail: r.rabbit@me.com'}< /Response>

Just went in to change more than a year old piercings and now they all feel as sore as I did when I pierced them. How I don't even understand. Ive changed piercings on my own before and never experienced this. Either their so called gold is fake and irritating my piercings or he did a horrible job putting them in.</review>

Took my girlfriend here to get snake bites. They figured out why the last place didn't get them looking even and did them perfectly, plus they're super friendly and professional.</review>

This was the particular boat and crew my Grandpa would fish with and after his passing the crew took us out to sea from Morro Bay to spread his ashes and do a burial at sea. The boat was clean and the crew was extremely friendly and helpful. I can see why my grandpa enjoyed spending time on that boat. I’d highly recommend using this company to do any fishing experiences.< /review>< pics>

The captain put us on the fish. The black pearl is a nice boat,

One of the deck hands  was RUDE, HE IS A TALL younger KID..... NOT.....COOL AT ALL.

I've been going our on boats for over 30 year's, I dont need a kid to trying to tell me what to do.

Other deck had was a good dude. Overall good trip....fishing was slow.<//text>

Great staffing, very helpful on the boat. Captain does his best to make sure everyone has a great time and is able to pull something up. Everyone was very encouraging to the youth that were fishing and again, were very helpful.</Text>

Our fishing trip was from 7am to 3pm and we ended up limiting out. The ship was clean and head(bathroom) was also clean.  Worth the money and highly recommend the sport fishing.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80ece19e582f4fef:0x93c104b6bff4800< /gmap_id></record>

Had a fantastic trip! Birthday present for my 11 yr daughter, her first time out. Captain James, deckhands, Aaron & Ventura on the Fiesta were all awesome! Didn’t catch our limit but the experience alone was well worth the $! Captain James & the deckhands were very knowledgeable & always there to assist. Captain even gave little one a tour of the wheel house & continues to check on her throughout our day. Will totally come back! Thank you to the Captain & crew you guys were amazing!< /Text>

Best boat and crew on the central coast, period. The only boat with a real galley and the food incredible...Thank you Lisa and Kaitlin. The crew is absolutely top notch. Kaitlin will amaze you with her gaff skills. Brian will put you on quality fish. The only boat on the central coast I will fish on anymore.< /Review>

<text>This was a great experience! I took a half day trip with my daughters (7 & 9) and my dad on the Black pearl. We went out in the morning and we all caught our limit in fish. The staff was very warm, friendly and knowledgeable about everything. They helped to bait the hooks, reel in as needed and cast. It didn’t matter your age or experience level, the staff were very efficient with attending to everyone’s needs. Before we docked, they weighed and filleted the fish for us. Check out their Facebook page for photos. I would definitely do this again and recommend it to friends and family.</text>< userid>

<Text>+ Clean and organized shop
+ Great variety on products that ranges from different price points
+ Helpful and professional staff who can provide tips for newbies and pros
+ From poles to reels, hooks to sinkers, tackle to bait...They carry it all. They also sell fishing gear, clothing and accessories.
+ Snacks sold here!
+ Boat chartering, fishing licenses, and rod rentals can be booked here.

My husband and his father had a blast fishing (even though the season was coming to an end). They were able to catch up to their maximum for the day so it's safe to say we have A LOT OF FISH! Great experience and totally worth the price of the fishing trip.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Today my wife and I went on Virgs 12 hour long fishing trip. My wife was really looking forward to the trip. Unfortunately she got sea sick right away and was not able to fish. She caught a couple. And I did not even notice until I left that she had more fish than I did. Not just more fish. But bigger fish. Virgs made sure she went home with her limit. And all big nice fish. It put a smile on her face and that means more than anything. Thank you Virgs.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80ece19e582f4fef:0x93c104b6bff4800< /gmap_id></record>

<Review>The Tackle shop itself deserves a 5 star rating! The charter maybe on a different day would be too but I wont know because I will not go back even if it was free. Booked a 3/4 day of shallow water fishing on the Black Pearl and before I booked it I asked whats the deepest we would be fishing and I was told no deeper than 150 ft. Not true the shallowest we fished was 190 ft. There was one deckhand for a full boat (40 people) and the lady behind the galley came out to help but they both had terrible attitudes Drew kept pulling people by the sweaters to make them move or shove them when they wouldn’t move over fast enough. Overall worst experience ever I brought my sister out for the first time and felt terrible that she had to experience this trip I told her not to let this ruin deep sea fishing for her because it’s never like this.
Boat left late
Didn’t catch our limit
Lady in the galley tried to sell me a soda with bird poop on it and gave me an ugly look when I asked if I could have a different one
Deckhand was extremely rude

Get your fishing license or hunting license here. Go on successful charter fishing trips from a long lasting fleet of party boats.

If you care, flip off the members of City council in Morro Bay because they continue to make fishing in this town more costly and have even tried to outlaw boat ownership (well stored on the street, in your driveway, on your side yard) so yes, flip them off lol< /review>

Got us on great fish, but the deckhands were extremely unfriendly and mean. I've been on a fair amount of charters and this was by far the worst experience. We limited and got a bunch of fish, but the crew did not make it fun in any way. Go with a different company, you'll be glad you did.</text>

<review>I took my son and grandson on our first ocean "sportfishing" trip on August 1, 2014. While I am not an *avid* fisherman, I have fished for years

I learned quite a few things from this trip both from the business operations and from fellow fishermen.

We went on a half-day trip. If you want to catch big fish, you simply do not have time to get into deep enough water to get them. The biggest fish on our boat that day was a whitefish which a passenger said "wouldn't even be in the running on a long range trip". (You throw $5 into the pot to gamble on who gets the biggest fish.)

The entire mission of the boat is to get the passengers out to the fish, get the bags filled, and get back to port as quickly as possible while taking every opportunity to separate you from your money. This is readily apparent on the half day trips.  Your trip is over when everyone has caught their limit, so everything that is legal to keep is "a good fish", a "nice one", or a "keeper", no matter how small.

This version of "Sportfishing" is basically a real life "Goldfish" game from a children's carnival. There's nothing involved other than dropping your line overboard and seeing what bites. You fish with a one pound weight and a two jig setup...for $7. You're BUYING them, not renting. It's a P U R C H A S E. (I should have suspected something when those setups came out of paintcans on the counter instead of their tackle selection...more on that later.)

if you don't have your own rod, you can rent them when you check in at their tackleshop. To rent three horribly backlashed and poorly maintained rods that looked like they were from the 1980s and purchase three setups, it was $63 (apparently, it used to be $10 per rod which would have been fair).

When you get to the boat, you show the ticket stamped "ROD" and you pick out a rental rod. Then you're offered the opportunity to "trade your setup for a pre-rigged rod" by tossing the weight and jigs into....guess what....no, seriously...GUESS...I bet you'll never...you did...A PAIR OF PAINT CANS that are obviously taken to the shop and set out for the next group of suckers.

Would you like to guess what is NOT available at the end of the trip? THOSE PAINT CANS!

When I went back yesterday to pick up my frozen fish from the shop, I asked about getting the weights and jigs THAT WE PURCHASED OUTRIGHT back. I was told "Oh, you should have cut them off of the rods when you left." I explained that they were never installed on the rods and that there were, in fact, ZERO RODS THAT WERE NOT RIGGED available, so there wasn't an option available to rig it yourself, that didn't matter to Mr. Old and Suddenly Cranky with glasses.

The deckhand with the gravelly voice was helpful, friendly, funny, and firm, but still polite, with the passengers who needed it. The Pre-Boarding lecture about keeping track of the number of fish in your gunny sack and them getting fined by undercover DFG agents a couple of weeks ago for being over the limit drove home the point, but I cannot see how "even the children on board will ticketed" if it happened again. (I confirmed later directly with the Cal Fish and Game that this statement was a load of bullcrap. The F&G agent was floored that they'd say that.)

The only orientation about the wildlife you get is a brief list of what we cannot keep due to fishing regulations. Apparently, there's a lot of "on the job" training involved in this. I'm sure the lady next to me would have loved to have known that the red rockfish have poisonous spines BEFORE she tried to land it herself. There were also a couple of instances of "LET ME GET THAT!" with some particularly nasty fish that can break free and go nuts once on deck, flailing around and envenomating everyone in its path. Forewarned is fore-armed and a little info ahead of time would be great.

As they were pouring the coffee onto her bleeding wounds, I asked "Did they try to charge you for the coffee?"

It's a tourist trap, fishing GRIND, and By God, they will squeeze every nickel and dime from you that they can.

I use this place to go fishing. I used to go with my grandfather when I was a teenager and have taken various gfs  and other family also.  The deck hands are very helpful with anything you.might need. They offer potato sacks to store your fish in as you catch them. There's a small aquarium like tank on the boat for excess fish u catch over your limit, which is great for those people who dont catch their limit, so they still can get the limit. The deck hands can filet your fish for you, for a small fee. The boat has a small kitchen where you can get hamburgers sandwiches chips sodas beer. They keep a tab and give u the bill on the way back to the marina. Fyi, keep track of what you buy. If you need extra line or new weights or hooks, they don't tell you there's an extra fee, or they charge you to rent the potato sacks. You find that out when they give you the bill. Overall great experience</text>

The last three times we have gone they have come in early and refused to give us our money back.  The captain of the boat says that it’s not good to fish on certain days and that we chose the wrong day.  Just not sure how it is that they know that yet they still go out or allow people to book on those days.  Seems as though it’s a way to short people while continuing to make money.  Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else these people suck and I really hope they go outback of business for this poor pathetic way of running business.</text>

(Translated by Google) This was my first time on a ship in the open sea and I loved it, at first I did not know how bad it would be but it was magnificent.
The efficient and fast staff, especially the super friendly captain and perfectly save what you want and where to take us. I recommend this experience was fun and wonderful.
Ha, and when the boys break up the Taco they mean hooks and lead (weights), not the fishing box. Hahaha always learns something new.

Was my first time on a boat and in the sea.
Awesome experience and the crew knows what are they doing.
I tangled a few times my line but they always ready to help specially the Capitan.
Definitely will go back and have that experience.
I recommend everyone this experience really fun and worth it. I didn't know that (taco?). Was the hooks and weight, not the fishing box. Hahahaha I know now

Esta fue mi primera vez en un barco en mar avierto y me encanto, al principio no savia que acer ni como seria pero fue magnifica.
El personal eficiente y rapidos, especialmente el capitan super amable y save perfectamente lo que ace y adonde llevarnos. Les recomiendo esta experiencia fue divertida y maravillosa.
Ha, y cuando los muchachos ablan the Taco se refieren a ansuelos y el plomo (pesas), no a la caja de pescar. Hahaha siempre aprende uno algo nuevo.

<text>This is a very good fast casual Mexican place for breakfast lunch dinner in Mountain View.  The Mountain View special burrito is my favorite its tasty fresh juicy rich and decent price. They have good tacos and a breakfast menu. Plus good Mexican refreshment drinks like Horchata and Rose drink. You will pay few bucks more on average than Taco Bell but you will get consistently better Mexican food. In the COVID time they are operating solid take out service with quick order completion. It's been a Best of Mountain View award winner for many years! Its kind of a hidden gem in a small strip mall.<//text></record>

We went here to celebrate an occasion, and were in the mood for Mexican. The food was quite average, especially for the prices charged. Everything was ok. Service was good, drinks were good. For reference we had the tacos, the jalapeno potatoes (very bland, no kick) and the seafood crepe(?) dish (it was ok).<//Text>

This is a very nice place - I like their burritos. It's hidden gem, probably you won't even notice it when you drive by. If you like burrito, then definitely give it a try - they won't disappoint.< /text>

My favorite place for burritos. The atmosphere in the store isn't much, but the burritos are the best around, and at a good price. They are certainly better than any of the big chains. Part of what makes them so good, is the choice of size (chico, regular, and super), beans (refried, pinto, and black), rice (spanish, brown, and white),  and salsa (mild, medium, and hot).<//Review>

My favorite burrito here is the Carnitas Chiconcoac.  There is a special flavor to this carnitas meat that hits the spot for me.  I went 2 days in a row ordering this.  I just missed the cutoff for ordering tonight so I'll grab another one tomorrow.<//Review>< pictures>

The best burritos in the South Bay. Huge variety of traditional meats, salsas, and sauces. You can go mild or spicy and the burrito flavors still shine through. It may look small on the outside but this is a local hot spot and very popular with many folks in the area. Definitely worth a stop if you love a great burrito!<//Text>

<date>1582168390705< /date><Rating>5</Rating><text>I'm lucky to have moved in right around the corner from the area's best burrito place! I recommend the Pollo en mole. They stew it fresh every day. One day I arrived right when they opened, and they had to ask back to the guy stirring this huge pot if it was ready yet. You may have to wait until it's properly lunch time for this treat!

La Costeña has been a great resource when we invite a number of friends over for a game day. We can all walk down there and everyone can have a nice custom made meal.

A lot of people get takeout here, and they keep the line moving quickly. If you want to sit (indoors, outdoors, or at their large community table), there is always plenty of room.

They are generous with their portions. They are precise with making everything as ordered.

They have vegetarian and vegan options. Ask them to customize any way you need. Since they make everything fresh they are knowledgeable about all the ingredients. It may not be a good pick, though, for those with highly sensitive allergies, as they can't guarantee there won't be cross-contamination from the assembly-line style of preparation.<//text>< pictures>

To me the sign of a great Mexican Taqueria is a kind of like a condiment and salsa bar that you can put the proper amount of heat on. This one doesn't have that. The food is very simple and Mild. It is still good. But you really have to ask for the hot stuff because they do not put it on and they do not even ask you how hot you want it</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Over the years, my daughter and I have taken out many a burrito from La Costena.  They are so delicious!  No wonder this plain-looking place win "Best of Mountain View" year after year.  Wait is usually short, although we do not really go there at peak hour.  Dining area is limited, and furniture is very minimal.  But I give five stars for the price/cost ratio: they are also very inexpensive.</text>

I have been going to La Costeña for years. When it was in the back of a Mexican market.  The burritos are excellent.  I highly recommend the mole.  It is not a typical, heavy chocolate mole.  It is more o a lighter brown color.  The taste is phenomenal. Their carne azada is on point too!  Their nachos, tacos and quesadillas are also great!  Staff is very friendly too.  I highly recommend this place!<//Text>

The food here was not bad but a bit on the mild side. I did not try the meat options (pescatarian) but the vegetable options left me quite disappointed.</review>

The service was good, and the food was, okay, a bit more salty than  usual.. But still good.. I think next time I'll just get a burrito instead of a plate. Overall, I give this a four star because of the food being a bit salty. Service was satisfactory.< /Review>< Pics>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>Very accessible place for burritos, also close to Sunnyvale if you are working there. Unfortunately I did not take any pictures. Useful if you want a tasty burrito to go. You can certainly sit down and there is space yet it is not formal at all so be aware of that. Score is mostly for the surroundings, food is good.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>This place is just a pale facsimile of it's former self when it was located on Middlefield Rd. I ordered the vegetarian burrito and the wife had chicken enchiladas. Both were pricey compared to other places we've been to and the guy behind the counter seemed completely indifferent to helping us. It took @ 10 minutes for the food to arrive and it was look warm. Had the food warmed, but it was fairly mediocre at best. Don't know why these guy's keep winning these best of Mountain View awards. There's nothing anymore about them that they deserve to win, and there's much better places locally.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808fb73df5dbdad3:0x977decc5fec0afad<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>I don't eat Mexican often but I've been here twice and had an excellent burrito each time:  first was chicken and the second was carne asada.  Quick service.  Can see how some people can think it is less than friendly but I thought the service was quick and efficient. Just don't expect conversation they are trying to get good food out quickly... good enough for me.  👍<//text>< pics>

Super quick! Very carb-tastic! Wonderful chicken. I got my food in about 2 minutes and had more than I could eat at once from the "super burrito." Calories per dollar? Optimized. If you want beans, rice, and tortillas :)< /review>

This was the first e-commerce site, when Sun engineers set up a fax+ xwindows tool(xburrito) to order from your desktop in the early 1980s. It was a grocery store then where you could order your custom burrito by pointing to what you wanted. Then Run by an old husband and wife team. Now the store has moved to a new location, and the ordering process has changed. The burrito is still good, but you can no longer ask for exactly what you want. The large one can still feed a family of four. Still one of the better burrito in town<//review>

Great handmade burritos made to order. It felt more customizable when they were at the old location but the place is still good. Same cashier guy as the old place so this appears to be a family business.  They have daily specials which is 4.99 for a regular burrito (any meat) which includes a can soda.  People mostly go for the mt.view special ( your choice of meat) burrito and it is always made well and fast. This is my go to place for burritos in the area.< /Review>

The burrito place hidden in the back of this Mexican convenience store isn't readily discoverable, but all the locals know about it and treasure it! The burritos are large and delicious, and there are a generous selection of ingredients. However, they don't offer seating, so be prepared to bring your food somewhere else.<//text>

<Review>Excellent burritos. The place holds the World Record for largest burrito ever made. What they don't tell you is their food is pretty damned good too. There are some places I like a little better... But La Costena is on my regular rotation of taco a burrito places... And it should be for you as well!< /Review><response>None< /response><Name>Jason Knudson< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<text>The best burritos in Mountain View. They have a big menu — eight or nine different kinds of meat, plus lots of other fillings. It's no longer a burrito bar, where you walk down the line and pick out the ingredients you want — you have to pick them all from the menu. But it still tastes just as good.</text><date>1512496290456<//date></record></dataset><record>

i find it quite telling that every bad review I've seen for them is full of poor grammar and atrocious spelling. this place is still as great as it was when it was back on old middlefield. i'm only sad that people can't have the same pick what you want as you walk along the ingredients experience. you can get their burritos however you want them, so if you don't like them, it's definitely on you! just wish it was in a more convenient location so i don't keep forgetting it's there!</Text>

Loved this place. I got the chicken mole 🌮 and the carne asada 🌮 and it was delicious. Their guac and salsa were SO great too. The rest of my party each got different things like the veggie 🌮 and the super burrito and everything was really good. I can't wait to go back there!</Text>

Best burrito place around.  Became a fan in their old location. New location is better with seating and ordering counter. Love the chicken mole or chicken adobado.  Generous sizes. Go with the special that includes all the extras.<//Review>

<Review>Great price, delicious burritos!
Many options of meat, salsa, beans to choose from.

You can choose between three different sizes, which is great because some other stores *coughChipotlecough* have such big burritos you feel kind of sick after eating it.< /Review><UserId.>115625972395544294581</UserId.><name>Carl Walsh<//name></record></dataset><record>

just be aware of what you're ordering. I think their "super" burrito relates to the size of the burrito rather than the ingredients.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

My husband wanted a breakfast burrito and based on reviews we decided to give this place a try. I was happy to see they had customizable options even with whole wheat tortillas and brown rice. Glad we came and will come back again.< /Review>

Still one of the best burrito places in the South Bay. They have a great selection of meat fillings and all the toppings that you might want. For breakfast, I heartily recommend the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito.</Review>

Mountain View local for last 25 years. This place is a scam artist to the T. $36 to feed 3. 2 bean and cheese burritos and 4 tacos. Wake up. Over priced. Over rated.</Review>

After all these years and a location change, La Costena still boasts the best burrito in the South Bay and one of the best in the Bay Area. When it comes to burritos, the attention to detail, the quality of each ingredient, and importantly, the balance between ingredients, are second to none. La Costena offers an exquisite variety of tasty meat options and plenty of fresh ingredients. Don't be afraid to customize your burrito and order exactly what you want! My go-to is a regular carne asada burrito with refried beans, Spanish rice, "both kinds of cheeses," sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, and hot salsa roja. Yum! Diced jalapeños or their "hot pico" option are fine additions if you want something spicy! Note that "regular" and "super" refer to the size of the burrito, not the ingredients.< /Text>

Consistently good over 25 years and 2 locations. Have always appreciated some of the ingredient types like the adobado and encebollado are fresh grilled for your order and at a great price point.<//Review>

These guys have some of the best burritos in the South bay. Fully customizable, fresh and delicious. You'll want to carry out though - not much ambience.< /Text>

<review>Don't let appearances fool you. Walk into the very sparse Mexican grocery on the corner of Middlefield and Rengstorff. In the back, you will find the source of the best burittos in the area.

La Costena is a small place dedicated to burritos. They have a large selection of proteins and other ingredients like veggies and cheeses. You choose all your ingredients as you go and watch them make it right in front of you.

They offer different sizes of burritos. Be careful when ordering the super burrito. It is actually a gigantic burrito made from two tortillas. They also offer a special every that includes a free canned drink.

They do have seating outside, which isn't bad on most evenings in Mountain View.< /review>< pictures>

I loved this place, in their old location. It seems as through they refuse to listen to order preferences at their new location...I only ask that they cut up the steak well and pit lots of rice. I'll pay for extra rice or I'll cut the steak more but alas I go elsewhere now, sadly.<//review>

I found it to be too complicated to get a burrito with all the toppings that I wanted. Sometimes hard to understand why basic things like jalapeños and sauces cost extra.</text>

Best burritos in Mountain View! This place has a huge variety of toppings, all delicious. My favorite part, though, is the "chico" burrito. For anyone who's struggled to finish an amazing burrito that's half again too big, the chico is for you!<//Text>

<review>SUPER BURRITO????? I have been to many different places where they have a "super burrito" and from what I've notice is that it's called "super" because they add more "prime" ingredients not just for the size. I order a so called " super burrito" and for the $13 I paid I was expecting much more then what I got. And what I got is not even worth $5. My "super burrito" had beans, rice, salsa Verde, and just SOME carne asada, and I said some because it was only like a soup spoon of meat in the middle. Very disappointed. Not worth the money I spent.</review>< Pics>

The burritos are definitely tastier than other options in the area. The people working here aren't necessarily friendly, but they are efficient.<//Review>

Okay Burritos. I just find it very strange that they take your order and make it in a back room. The vegetables are not fresh.</review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>[From August 2008]

I ordered an enchilada platter today and was pretty darn pleased.

PORTION: Large, but not humongous.  That's fine :)
BEANS (whole): Cooked nicely, decent scoop, a bit watery, though (lady was too impatient to let it drain).
SALSA (mild): Don't really taste it in the mix.  To their credit, they have a selection of salsas.
GUAC: Really tasty!  Seems decently fresh.
MEAT (chicken mole):  Cooked perfectly (tender, not dry).  Nicely seasoned, but nothing amazing.
ENCHILADA:  Grilled with cheese on it, not microwaved!  This may seem like a no-duh idea, but I've been bummed at how many Mexican places just nuke their enchiladas!
CHIPS:  None offered.  Hey, that sucks :-(
COST:  Not too bad, but charging for everything extra is annoying.
DRINK:  Maybe I missed it, but no horchata and such?  WTH?
SERVICE:  Okay.  Woman wasn't particularly friendly.
PARKING:  Yeah, it generally sucks, but there were two open spaces on this Sunday afternoon.

People rave about La Bamba compared to this?!  You can see my review of that place, but in a nutshell, why?!?  La Bamba offered practically no customization (not even choices of salsa?!?), and their burrito tasted more like a quesadilla to me... way too much cheese.  Yuck.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

The price of the tacos/burrito is unbeatable. Starting from $2~, it's hard to find food at this price point.<//Review>
