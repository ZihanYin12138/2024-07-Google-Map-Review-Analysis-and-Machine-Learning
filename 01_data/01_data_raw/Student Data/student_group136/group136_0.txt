We ordered these items every year and they always taste delicious and up to par. If I had to choose a favorite pizza, I would say the mushroom one was the best!  They put a decent amount of toppings on each pizza. Even if you aren't allergic to gluten, I highly recommend getting the gluten free crust because it is so nice and crunchy and soft!</Text>

<Text>Thin crust pizza is thin...  Chicago pizza is thicker, but crust is not soft and toasty on the outside.  Italian combo deep dish was like a tomato sauce pizza. Ingredients not noticable and appears to be mixed together with sauce. We also had a salad and chicken wings. Although some people in my group thought the food was fine, I would have enjoyed a Costco combo pizza more. I would find another place, since I was not satisfied, and likely would not return.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Pizza dough/crust was good enough to eat! Many pizza restaurants seem to think the toppings are the only things that matter. I would definitely recommend trying Blue Line!< /Review>< user>

I've lost count how many times I've ordered directly (I don't use food delivery services) from Blue Line Pizza in Daly City. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but I do highly recommend the Classic Sliders, Pulled Pork Sliders, Chicken Caesar Salad, and Deep Dish Cheese pizza. Customer service is always friendly & accommodating. However, I have to give a special shout out to my fav Benjamin. When taking my phone order he's always personable, thorough, and fast without making you feel rushed. I highly recommend Blue Line Pizza!< /Review>

The Meatball has meatballs (they said it's spicy meatball, but it was not spicy at all, spinach, mushroom and ricotta cheese on top. The ricotta cheese was a good addition to it. The Chicago chop has pepperoni, sausage, bacon and salami. It's any meat lovers fave. My friend pretty much destroyed it.<//Text>

We ordered a deep dish italian pizza. It took around 30 minutes to be prepared, but we had a couple beers to pass the time. Upon first bite, man oh man, it was worth the wait. I love the buttery crust and all the flavors, so good! The crust was perfectly crispy, despite all the gooey deliciousness piled on top of it.</Text>

Despite the pandemic going on, I see great practices of proper hygiene and cleanliness observed at the place.
If you've eaten here before, it's not changed.
They still serve the great food, albeit being quite oily.</review>

I ordered a pizza for delivery recently. Chicken pizza had 3 chicken cubes on whole pizza. I would love to have at least a chicken piece every slice. So everyone eating the pizza can taste chicken. Probably you guys ran out of chicken right at the time you prepare my pizza! But you guys compeled me to write this to one of my fav place!<//review>< Pictures>

Good, laid back atmosphere and great food. At times, I've gotten pizzas with the slices not cut all the way through which is a bit annoying. Also would be nice if they had a vegan cheese and vegan crust option for the vegans out there. Other than thag, the service is generally good. Variety of beers and wines available and, of course, great pizza! Lots of great toppings and specialities. Good appetizers as well.</Review>

Great food, good service.

A large pizza can easily feed 2 people. Throw in cheese bread and wings and you can feed 4.< /text>

Enjoyed the Italian Combo deep dish pizza well enough, but couldn't help feeling it lacked the taste of "fennel seed" or maybe Italian sausage.  Started with the shishito peppers. Aiyiyi - they only made me even hungrier.  Would love to be back for Happy Hour again.</review>

<Review>A minor gripe but one that really seems to bother me. When you order to go and ask for extra dressing/chicken with the salad they add it to the box the salad comes in. So you get less salad. If I asking for extra Dressing why the hell would I want less salad. Oh he wanted extra chicken on the side lets fill 2 tiny cups with the normal portion of chicken and call that 2 sides of chicken then lets shove that in a box with a dressing container and there ya go 1/4 the salad same amount of chicken and I just paid you extra. Something like this has happened to me alot no matter how I order and the place is way over priced for that kinda BS.<//Review>< resp>

The deep dish and the thins are the same price. So if you're hungry, go deep dish. Anything w/ meat is good. Also, the mushroom pizzas is tasty.

Don't forget to ask for honey for the deep dish.</review>< Pictures>

<username>Garrot Gronert</username><resp>None< /resp><Review>We were on our way to Burgermeister, out standby for late lunches close by, but we saw Blue Line pizza and went for the first time yesterday for a late lunch around 2PM. The place was packed, but we got a table almost immediately. Apparently they just changed their menu, so the menu you see online is not up to date. The menu is mostly pizza, but they do have salads and sandwiches. You can get a deep dish pizza, a thin crust pizza or a gluten free pizza. You can make your own or choose one of their very tempting options< /Review>< Pics>

Ok, I read the reviews and decided to give this place a try. I love pizza and have to eat gluten and dairy free so it’s a challenge to impress me, but Blue Line was able. Sean, my server was quick, thorough and attentive. I ordered the gluten and dairy free Italian and it was amazing. Loved the gluten free crust and didn’t miss the cheese. I will definitely come back!<//review>

<Text>We got individual sizes (only served before 4) of the Blue line and the white pie and both were very good. We got the thin crust. It was light and crispy. I think I'll go with light cheese next time but that might just be personal preference.

They also have vegan options.< /Text>< Date>

We had a caprese salad and the spicy meatballs to start.The salad was really good, I love tomatoes and mozzarella cheese, so we couldn't really go wrong with that.The meatballs weren't spicy AT ALL. I'm the most sensitive person for spice EVER, so believe me, not spicy.The pizza was good, we got a half and half large pizza and had a lot of leftovers to take home. Crust was really thin and crispy, we really liked it.</review>

Great pizza options and service. Nice bar area and beautiful wood tables which made my stay very relaxed. Went with my family, who love baseball, so it made it easy that they were playing the giants game. Only downside was that this place is a bit pricey. . overall good stay and great meal.</Review>

The pizza and salad were good. Our only complaint was about ordering a drink.
Ordered a Manhattan and received a Whiskey and 7-up with bitters because they don't have Vermouth.
If you don't have Vermouth then say we don't have Vermouth. I'll order something else.< /review>

< review>
Came here after work on Friday to unwind and was greeted warmly by our friendly bartender, Phillip. Service is great - we sat at the bar to eat because it was busy, and he was attentive despite having to run around and serve many people. Even accommodated our requests for extra toppings and gave us solid recommendations for pizza.

My friend, Natalie M., and I split a half bbq chicken/wild mushroom and truffle thin crust pizza that hit the spot just right. Only reason I knocked off a star was the wild mushroom pizza needed some pizzazz and we had to ask for extra jalapeños and honey to experiment (highly recommend the changes we made) and the bartender needs some work on his cocktail repertoire, but he was open to learning.
All in all...I'm coming back next Friday :) got a new regular, Blue Line.<//review>

Get the DEEP DISH pizzas here. I got the Indio usual Classic deep dish and it was so yummy -- stuffed with Italian sausage and tomato chunks. But next time I would opt for the actually regular size deep dish pizzas instead. I feel like you get the full deep dish pie experience of a deep dish with all the layers and heaviness of the toppings with the regular sizes. I loved the cornmeal crust -- so delicious.

We also got the personal individual pesto chicken pizza and it tasted healthy and light. It was a bit bland and I would have liked a bit more garlic pesto taste.

Their crust is super on point though! Their salads are good too. I tired the Bacon and Blue salad -- bacon was a bit dry, but I did like the creaminess of the blue cheese and the deep flavors of the grilled onions.

Love their simple menu of pizzas. And especially love that they offer everything in the personal individual size as well. Service was friendly and amazing. Lots of table instead. Super clean and tall floor to ceiling windows. Great place to satisfy your pizza cravings.< /review>

Best pizza in Daly City by far it’s even an easy walk from the Bart (all down hill!) and you can work off the great deep dish pizza in the way back :) I never rate 5 stars but the quality was by far worth the five stars! Customer service is definitely lacking but don’t let that discourage the staff all seem friendly just a little under staffed at times.<//Review>

the place was noisy, and not the nicest atmosphere I can think of. The pizza however was one of the best I can recall having, therefore the 5 stars. The staff and the local breweribeers didn’t drag down either.< /review>

1 star because of the service. When I order pizza, I love loading it with a bunch of toppings. When I told the server what toppings I wanted, she gave me a snarky remark and walked off. Look. If you don't want to let your customers CREATE THEIR OWN PIZZA, don't put it on the menu.</Review>

<Text>Pizza is my favorite food so I eat a lot of pizza and I like their pizza. My favorite is the BBQ chicken as a deep dish. I prefer the deep dish so I have more to eat but both thin and deep dish are good. Just remember you have to wait if you're hungry cause it takes a while to cook those.</Text>< time>

<review>It took us a while to go through the whole menu, as there were so many dishes and specials. The beef and scallop combination was delicious. Probably the best beef I have ever had in a Chinese restaurnat. Large flavorful chunks, tender, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. The scallops were also done right, not too chewy.< /review>< pics>

Wings were really good! Deep dish pizza was okay, the mushroom pizza we got wasn't that deep or saucy.</Review>

<Text>One of the few places that I enjoy za! Nice crust and has taste probably proofed over a day, sauce is fresh and flavorful, toppings always enjoyable. Very good deep dish style with the sauce on top and the mozzarellas on the bottom, Chicago style. Definitely a heavy pizza and not a neopolitan thin and crispy place. That being said, the flavors are great, not too much garlic, well balanced.<//Text>< time>

<Text>Phone order for pickup. The server neglected to tell me the total for my order but asked for payment. Paid cash at the bar but asked for a receipt so I could see the total. The manager acted as if I was inconveniencing him for a receipt and the total amount and couldn’t get me a receipt. It took him 5 minutes as my pizza got cold. Who likes lukewarm pizza?</Text>< Pictures>

All around solid deep dish pizza. Be prepared for a 30 min as your cheesy goodness comes out! Ask for honey on the side for your crust.</Review>

The food does not vary from other locations I've been to... Good quality pies, creative use of toppings with pretty generous servings. Located in a mall area so good parking can be harder to find.< /text>

Blue Line Pizza is a spin off from Little Star Pizza and the pizzas are always delicious.  I'm a fan of the thin crust pizzas!< /Text>

<review>One of the few places that serves deep dish pizza (takes at least 30 min to make, so the wait is long) - so, they accidentally gave our order that we waited for 30 minutes, to the table next to us! :( Needless to say we left and have not gone back since...< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<text>Walked out after 7 minutes of sitting there with no one ever stopping by the table to greet us. Four staff members were walking around and passing us, but we didn’t even get a “hello.”  We assumed the rest of the experience would be just as bad and went next door where we were greeted as we walked in and our waiter stopped by in about three minutes< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

The Little Star/Blue Line store are hands-down my favorite pizza in the Bay Area. Arizmendi/Cheeseboard come in a close second, and in fact are often better -- but they are a little less reliable, in the sense that I sometimes just don't like the ingredients on their pizza of the day. I've tried a lot of others, and Blue Line bests them all, including other highly rated pizza places like Patxi's and Zachary's. Gialina's in Glen Park comes close, but their pizzas don't travel well and you really need to eat them in the shop, as compared to Blue Line (we get takeout most of the time).</Text>

So I really like their deep dish pizzas. However, I will never eat at this restaurant again. The last two times I went there it took slightly over an hour to get my food. Maybe it's just me, but I find that ridiculous. My advice is to do take out.</Review>

<Review>Terrible customer service. We called ahead and were told only 5-10 minutes for a table, got there 5 minutes later and were told 45 minutes for a table. The hostesses were rude, the manager was rude, and no one seemed like they knew what they were doing. Do takeout but don’t bother with dining in.<//Review>< gmap_id>

This place is so welcoming and I really like taking my dog here. She comes out really nice and clean and smells soo good!! She has alot of hair and they know just how to treat her and cut her hair. I truly recommend this place.</review>

I wanted to really write a thorough review on this business regarding my recent visit.

First, I’d like to say that this isn’t the first time my dog has been groomed at salcido’s. My mother took care of my dog for a period of time while I was away in school, so she chose where to get my dog groomed. Up until a little under a year ago, I’ve had my dog with me all of the time and she has a particular groomer and grooming service that I love in the Bay Area of California. However, I’m staying in the area for a few weeks and my dog needed to be groomed.

Onto my experience, I took my dog in at 10 AM on the dot day of appt. One issue is the fact that I did not receive word of my dog until 2:15 PM. It took almost four and a half hours to finish grooming my dog. The business should allocate time properly and be done with grooming in a timely manner. I am used to 2 hours more or less and 4+ hours is excessive given that my dog did not have any issues with her fur and is a calm and easy-going dog. She also had irritated eyes as they were and still are after several hours, extremely red and her demeanor was down and different than how she usually is.

Second, due to Covid there is a sign saying no one will be serviced or allowed into the building without proper ppe such as a mask. Yet, I physically saw a woman get out of her car without a mask, go into the building without a mask and she was able to retrieve her dog and was not turned away. This is not only not following regulations that are being enforced in California right now, but it also puts at risk other customers, employees and the animals being groomed.

Third, I’ve been to a lot of grooming businesses due to owning multiple poodles, Maltese mixes, and other furry fur babies and at salcido’s all you hear are dogs crying non-stop. It’s normal for dogs to whine as they are uncomfortable at times being groomed, but this was excessive and made me worry for my dog’s well being and safety. To add on to that, I walked in while a dog was crying and the groomer or whoever was attending the dog was speaking roughly to the dog and it did not sound like a good interaction.

Fourth, the employees do not act like or seem to be dog lovers. Usually employees who work with animals are loving and gentle with pets, but these employees are not and that should open the window to how they may treat your pets when you take them. One last thing is that it smells bad inside the business. At drop off, it did not smell like urine and feces, but at pick up it did and it was very strong which does not ease my feelings of how the dogs are waiting to be groomed and where they relieve themselves and if they are relieving out of fear. They also only accept cash, which is a bit inconvenient especially being 2020, but less of a serious issue. I expect the best for my pets and I know a lot of other people do as well so I wanted to share my personal experience and opinion. I will be taking my dog elsewhere.< /Text>

I'm very happy with their grooming and boarding service.  They are very professional and they returned everything I took for my doggie, even the left over dog food.  I sincerely recommend Salcido's for all of your pet's needs.  I'll definitely take my Pug there again:))</review>

I always feel comfortable going because I know everyone will usually be smiling and cheery.
Whenever they are getting ready for, let’s say cleaning, they would explain every step so I’m not the only clueless one in the room.
They are usually very gentle and doesn’t hurt much. However, if there was something bothering me, if I address it, they would look into it thoroughly, examine the X-rays and my actually teeth, then when they find the possible solution, it will be explained slowly so it would make sense to me.
I just love them and recommend them to everyone that asks for a good dentist.</review>

My 9 yo daughter needed a tooth extraction and was in pain. Her regular dentist couldn’t see her for 2 weeks! So I called Sachi, as they were recommended by a good friend. They were able to get her in the next day! The Staff was extremely friendly and professional. The doctor was very caring, kind and nurturing. He made my daughter feel at ease during a procedure that had caused her quite a bit of anticipated anxiety.
It was over and done in a less than 1/2 hour.
What a great experience! We will definitely be returning ! I’ve booked appointments for my other children and for myself.
Thank you to the entire staff at Sachi!!<//Review>

<Text>Love this place so much! Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. The hygienists are very knowledgable and take their time to educate you about oral care. Dr. Sachi and Izumi are amazing, they even call you days after your procedure to ask if everything feels okay. Scheduling is very organized and they are always on time. The doctors only recommend procedures  that you really need (they’ll even tell you when something is not necessary) and when they do, they easily give you a quote to help you decide if you can do it or not.  I just love how everything flows so smoothly whenever I come for appointments! I’ll give 10 stars if I can 💛<//Text>< user_name>

I as many others dread going to the dentist. I recently had a crown become loose (that ended up breaking completely off right before my appt) and needed to find a new dental office as my previous dentist retired. Sachi & co. Was referred to me by a good friend, and man am i glad.  Becky, Dr. Peter Cacos and the rest of the office staff were awesome! Becky made it super easy to schedule, handled the billing stuff effortlessly, and after the procedure followed up every day to Make sure i was doing alright and wasn’t having any issues. Dr Cacos was also great in calming me down and making the experience much more pleasant than i was used to and expected, oh and btw did excellent work!  This was by far my best dental experience and am actually looking forward to my next appointment to continue fixing my old dental work. So glad i found them to Be our family’s new dental office!!! Thank you so much!</Text>

<Review>I’ve been a patient of Dr. Fujita since she started practicing.  She has been our family dentist for my husband and children.  Now she’s also dentist to my grandchildren.  When she moved her practice to Torrance, my family moved with her.  Dr. Chen is also a wonderful dentist in the practice whose expertise and professionalism is as sharp as Dr. Fujita.  The office staff is always friendly and professional.  They make me feel comfortable and important at each visit. I would highly recommend  Drs. Fujita and Chen to anyone looking for a competent and caring dentist.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Sachi is very greedy.
When you go to a dental consultation, she first takes an X-ray of that part.
After that, she pushes, "There are some parts that cannot be seen, so it is better to do a CT scan." The CT scan costs $ 350 and is not insured.
Of course she charges for X-ray too.
Se is a very unfriendly dentist who will charge you money immediately.
I was forced to sign a consent form after a CT scan. !!
She is the worst dentist.<//Review>

I hadn't been  to a dentist for  over twentys something  years due to a  horrible  experience.. On a Friday afternoon at 4 pm  they took my in.. Stopped  a pain I can't begin to  describe.  Got me back in immediately  and fixed me up.  Dr. Sho Izumi is a gentle handed, music  humming  wonderfully amazing  dentist.  With a kind humor that made this grumpy man  relax in the face of his own fears.. Thank you.. You all have my gratitude..<//Text><GmapID>0x80c2ca7fe3c8e255:0xf4eb69d4c56ea9c3</GmapID>< Resp>

I had a crack in an old filling and they fixed me up really quickly and painlessly. They recommended a night guard and it's really helped with my headaches.  Their entire staff is very friendly and professional. I highly recommend Sachi & Co.</text>

It was my first time there. They have some amazing stylist. All the right precautions are taken, mask, social distancing, bring your own water, and no blow drying cause of Covid-19. I absolutely loved it. My stylist Gracie, did a balayage.< /Review>

Found Shear Vanity on Yelp. Made an appointment on Sunday despite the salon being closed on sunday and monday I got a response when I emailed them. I got a call from Esther on the day I wanted to go in and told I'd be good to come in.
I went in for a cut. I went from mid back length hair to just above my shoulders and I love it!!!
Jessica shampooed and conditioned before doing most of the cut and Esther gave it some texture before Jessica finished with the style I had asked for. She knew what to do to get my curly hair to cooperate and it came out great!
The salon is a pretty big size and it's open, clean, and welcoming as was the receptionist at the front.
I felt pampered and I liked the vibe!!
I'm definitely going to go back as I would like to maintain this short length for a while and I'll definitely need to get it trimmed from time to time.
The price is also pretty good, I was expecting a lot more considering I have a lot of hair and I had asked to get it styled as I sat down on the chair instead of mentioning it when I first emailed them.</text>

<review>Went here for the first time yesterday for a hair cut and it was hands down the best salon experience I’ve had. Jessica cut my hair EXACTLY how I wanted it, she was so sweet and easy to talk to. Everyone else was also so warm welcoming. Price was great too. So glad I found my new hair spot and hair lady!</review></record></dataset><record>

This is just based off the run around they gave me over the phone. I was asking about orices and who specializes in what services, ssked me to keave my ohone number and they would give me a call vack, never did, waited for 2 days, called back and was told the stylist i would need was not working that day, was given their number, then stylist, who was super nice, informs me she doesnt do that service, and was tokd to call the salin so they can give me the info on the stylist who does. Ummmmm, i thought they had already. Gave up, was really hoping to get my hair done by them, their client pictures look amazing :(<//Review>

First time here after years of searching for a salon that can manage my stubborn curly hair and I believe I've found the right spot! The salon is located right behind main street Firestone which is great for parking. As for the salon itself, it has a modern look with lovely big windows. Not too girly for the gentlemen. I got my haircut from Amber who is a charming girl and she did an AWESOME job. Might just give me the courage to explore new hairstyles. But nonetheless everyone should come here! Great people, and decent prices. Can't complain :)<//review>

<Review>My wedding was in March and I didn't know where to get my hair and makeup done so I was really stressed. A coworker recommended this establishment, I was a bit skeptical at first since I only saw one picture of my friend when she got her makeup done. I also saw some of their instagram pictures. I didn't have an idea of how I wanted my hair and as for my makeup I didn't want to look like someone totally different. The day of, I got to my appointment and they were very nice and welcoming offered refreshments i.e coffee or water. The staff was very attentive and it was a busy Saturday morning. I absolutely LOVED the updo and the makeup. Very elegant and vintage, just exactly what I imagined. I got many compliments from my guests and family. I would definitely refer my friends and family here. To top it all off I wasn't overcharged like other places. I was an extremely satisfied customer. Thank you Sheer Vanity staff for the time and dedication you take to enhance the beauty of women.</Review>< Pics>

Nency is an artisan with hair. A couple weeks ago, she asked if I wanted to try something different, and away she went. I thought the hair looked dope, but later that night I was an extra in a music video. People kept on coming up to me the whole night, and were just talking about how cool my cut was. The cinematographer, a lot of extras, and the main lighting girl all went on and on... i'm not even exaggerating. At the end of the night, there was this girl that brought to my attention how much detail went into the cut, and pointed out that Nency had made these slight lines right before the comb part where the hair is styled and told me how impressed she was because it just made everything pop!

Seriously, if you want a sick cut. Check her out.</Text>

<Review>I went in for a short women's haircut. Although my hairdresser Joe was friendly, he did not consider the haircut I wanted. He didn't take the time to really look at the photos. I usually have it a bit shorter, and I curl the ends with moose. He cut nearly all of my hair away and I have something like a pixie cut now. He cut away the hair around my ears and now I have misshapen sideburns, and I expressed that I never cut the hair there. I feel so exposed and embarrassed. I am genuinely mortified at my appearance. I don't know what I can do but wait with nearly all of my hair gone. I am just so saddened by this whole experience I can't stop crying.< /Review>< Rating>

I hadn't had a haircut since a few months before covid, and my bangs had grown passed my chin. I finally came in and Joe did an awesome job making my hair and bangs look great. Super friendly. Thanks so much.

I also like that they did a temp check and hand sanitizer. Doing a great job with covid precautions</Text>

I was never a supercuts fan, but here I am writing this review.

Before me coming here, I would go to my local barbershop. Here are a couple of reasons why I switched over.

1. Long waiting line even up to 2hrs to get a haircut, although you called to book an appointment.
2. They only take cash, which is a hassle to waste time at the bank.
3. Some barbers like yapping instead of getting down to business and just cut hair.

Those are a couple of reasons why I come to Supercuts. They get down to business and charge around 20 bucks. At least at this location, when I book an appointment, I don't have to wait to get a haircut, but the most beautiful part of this is they accept debit cards which is a massive advantage for people like myself that hate wasting time at the ATMs.

I hope this helps persuade you, have a fantastic day!<//text>

Took my son for his 1st haircut here and the staff were so friendly and entertaining for him that he stood really calm throughout his haircut. They also gave him a balloon and offered if I wanted to have some of his hair for keepsakes and gave me a little baggie and certificate with it.< /Text>

<Name>Fabian Raygosa</Name><Review>It’s fine. Good haircuts. Always in timely manner. It’s the price that bothers me. I actually can get my sons haircut cheaper with same quality elsewhere at a local barber. However their hours availability is very spotty forcing me to come here.

Good place for a quick haircut. Price for male hair cut is 18$. They havent upgraded to a computerized listing system so a lot of the scheduling is done by paper and pencil. But they make up is speed and haircuts.

The layout looks like it needs a makeover but I dont mind it as long as the haircuts are wonderful. The feeling I get when I walk in is... Needs new carpets and brighten up the location with some colors besides neutral blue and grey.</text>

Here, everything is charged separately and the guy gave me a weird look when he finished with my cut and asked if it looked ok. I said yes but aren't you going to blow dry my hair? He said oh that's extra.  So annoyed. No my hair looks greasy and gross. Thanks.  Not coming back.  And also it wouldn't hurt to clean your station before your next client and not have them step on the previous clients hair.  Just saying.</review>< Pictures>

I was satisfied, the service and cost were reasonable, and not like other barber shops who gouge their customers with outrageous prices for a trim.. My neighbor paid $45 for a trim and his hair was already short.. Let our memories remember these company's in the future and take our business elsewhere.. Covid 19 is no excuse for rip off.. Supercuts maintains good customer relations despite this pandemic..😃</Text>

Excellent service by Johnson!  This is   my favorite Korean restaurant around here because of price/food.  Lucky it’s right across from my condo; yum!  Before pandemic, went here every week; will go back again soon!  One of my favorites.

Haven’t tried  popular fried chicken there although heard it’s comparable to Bonchons! No reason  to switch from my usual order of delicious Korean tofu soup in clay pot and bibimbop. perfect Korean lunch which I’ve had here for years! They adjust spiciness to your level which is great because sometimes  don’t want it too spicy 🌶 but if I’m feeling daring I do and love it too!!  Excellent, simple, small Korean restaurant with great food/prices.  Being next to Tiger Tea is a bonus. Anyanghaseo!!</review>< Pictures>

I love this place, the spicy fried rice cake combo is good. We got spicy and it was the perfect amount of spice. I love all the cheese! Yum. The spam rice and everything else was pretty good too. For the wings, I prefer original honey as it taste more crispy. My friend did the hot challenge and she was able to eat 3 wings...lol. I’m not sure what her spicy tolerance is. Haha. The soft tofu soup needs work tho. It’s a bonus that you can go to Tiger Tea next door after!</text>

The rice cakes are super chewy. $20 gets you a big bowl of rice cakes, fish cakes, sausage, veggie, egg with cheesy spicy sauce. If you can't take spice they'll let you get an extra mild. 🌶 🔥 🧀< /Text>

After a day of wedding planning we found ourselves quite hungry. As one who craves Korean food all the time. It was only fitting we stumbled across Spicy factory. Even better there was a free large parking lot. No need to parallel park or pay a parking meter. Double Score!

I was not present in line to order, but My Love mentioned they were really friendly! They even gave him a complementary plastic bag to pick up our dog's poop. Also they honored the happy hour snack price for him as well instead of waiting until 3 pm to order again. Not only did they have customer oriented service, but were quick to cook our food. We didn't have to wait very long and was able to devour our meal in no time.

They do have weekday lunch specials that include a few choices of main dishes and two sides. We shared the lunch special "spicy" chicken combo of three wings, two drums, and choice of two sides. Of course we chose both rice and kimchi to accompany our chicken!

Even though the moist chicken isn't as crispy as others expect, it is actually pretty flavorful and has a good amount of heat. The kimchi was fresh and delicious. It was very much appreciated when they securely wrapped the kimchi in foil. The juice didn't find its way everywhere in the to go container. There is also original and honey for those who are interested in more mild flavors.

In addition to the lunch special we had the happy hour snack spicy rice cake. This has been my new favorite Korean food to eat so you can bet I was excited they had it on the menu! In this order it also came with fish cakes, vegetables, melted mozzarella cheese, and red spicy sauce that was just tasty.

I loved how the spicy rice cake snack came out piping hot! It still retained its temperature even after taking pictures and eating it for a bit. Now that I know I like their sauce I will definitely order the larger spicy fried rice cake combo the next go round with the other savory toppings!

Between the two of us we both were satisfied and would say the happy hour and lunch special prices are great deals. Considering the nearby choices I would choose Spicy factory over the other neighboring eats!< /Text>

Very excited for this new place. I'm glad it didn't disappoint. They have a lunch menu, not bad pricing. I had the spicy mild wings. It's 6 wings with 2 sides. The crispiness is perfect and they have an addicting sauce. Very nice waiter and service is great. Loved the fact that the moment you step in you can actually sign in electronically, you type your name, phone number and party size and just wait untill you are texted to let you know your table is ready. Totally coming back and excited about their snack options.< /text>

<Review>Found this hidden gem today! It’s in Burlingame plaza next to Tiger Tea & Juice. (It’s in the corner)
The menu was pretty extensive. They have fried chicken, Korean tofu soup and other Korean dishes. The spicy rice cake with toppings add-on looked very special and yummy. I’m gonna try that next time when I’m with friends.
Today I got their lunch special. You get to choose 1 main dish(wings/drums/fish/) and 2 sides(rice/salad/kimchee/pickles) and the price was only $10.95
Pretty nice place and reasonable price.
The chicken was crispy and tender. And they let you choose the spicy level which is great cuz I don’t really eat spicy so I chose mild and it was delicious!
I’m glad that I found this place cuz there isn’t many Korean restaurants in this area. I’ll be back very soon!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Love this great neighborhood restaurant! They're set up for COVID pickups with a table far away from the staff. Tasty chicken wings, I've enjoyed the original, honey and spicy versions. Also love their garlic fries - thin cut with the right sprinkling of garlic. Beef soondobu / tofu stew is hearty and delicious too!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

We just ordered kimchi fries. The portion was huge, but the fries themselves were mediocre. They take frozen shoe string fries (nothing wrong with frozen per se), sprinkle a tiny bit of chopped kimchi on top, and then DROWN it in thousand island sauce (see picture). We thought it was cheese when we first opened the box. We hadn't expected to pay 7 dollars for fries covered in thousand island. We ended up frying up some of our own kimchi and adding it to the fries so that it wouldn't just taste like we were spooning thousand island into our mouths. Fudging up such a simple snack isn't promising, so we probably won't be back.< /review>

We ordered the rice cake bowl to share among three people. It has rice cake, fish cake, mini sausage, vege and mozzarella cheese on top. We ordered it mild. We also ordered mild tofu soup that comes with white rice and an egg which you can crack and add to the boiling soup. As for spiciness,  it was tolerable. The dish was good. I personally liked the tofu soup more, especially on a cold winter day. The rice cake was tasty but kind of heavy.

I've had much better tteokbokki and Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) in the bay (particularly in Santa Clara). The menu lacks variety and desperately needs a few additional Korean staples. For peninsula standards Spicy Factory is acceptable.<//review>

Better than Bonchon for the saucyness imho

No small portions of ddeokbokki or budae jiggae(army soup) though.

Kind of a sparse hole in the wall, much less popular than next door Tiger Tea. However their signature dishes are quite good.

One thing to keep in mind is that their mild is spicy, and it goes up from there.

The rice cake bowl can comfortably feed 2. We did not add any extra toppings as they seem quite pricey. However the dish is quite varied and flavorful as is. One thing I did not like was the hard-boiled eggs which were quite grainy from being overcooked. Otherwise it's simply delectable with a tasty balance of sweet, salty and hot, with all kinds of interesting textures from the rice cakes, gooey mozarella, and crunchy veggies.

The fried chicken were quite large though not the mutant sized you get at Bonchon. Inside was not as moist as the best KFC but still quite acceptable. The crispiness and the flavors are done well, the spicy and the honey are both interesting in their own rights.

Great for a afternoon or late night snack!</text>

Located at the trousdale end of the Burlingame plaza, this eatery is scheduled to open this fall. Highlights of their menu include fried chicken, crispy fried rice cakes, beer, soju and wine. We recently tried out some of their menu and it was quite good. The wings were fun and the bibimbap portions were big. Will be definitely going back for more of those wings.</Review><Response>None</Response></record>

(Translated by Google) It is a house where you can eat chibab and chimaek is also available The menu is delightful. It's not a typical Korean chicken restaurant. It seems that the owner is not Korean, but the taste is not bad. Spicy taste recommended!

Let me first say that the only reason this location is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because I have been getting my taxes done here for a few years without issue. I wanted to write this review to warn people against using Francis Donahoe as their "tax perfessional". This was my first time dealing with Francis (aka Frank) since my usual person was unavailable. I was slightly frustrated throughout the process because Frank seemed to struggle with the program that they use to file taxes. I thought he was only struggling to read due to font size but near the end I realized he didn't seem to have sufficient knowledge of the program itself. After sitting through a longer than usual tax prep it was time for payment options. I stated that I would pay using my debit card. Frank suggested just having the service fees taken out of my tax refund. I agreed to this and Frank stated he would be sending digital copies of my return to my H&R block account.  Cut to two weeks later and I still haven't received an email confirming that my tax returns had been accepted by the government. I logged into my H&R account to see if there was any info and it stated that there was no paperwork on file. I contacted the location for further assistance and they found that even though Frank had suggested and told me that my fees would be coming out of my refund, he listed that I would be paying in person and did not actually file my taxes. I will be making a second trip to pay in person and to ensure that my taxes are actually filed this time but thought I'd take a moment to save others from going through the same hassle I went through.</text>

Veronica was helpful with appointments, it made for overall a friendly trustworthy place.

I felt comfortable and in good hands doing my taxes, I plan to return to file my taxes next year with H&R Block. Thank you for the great service.< /review><gmapID>0x80dc9bb9140155d1:0x6a0072edb9f3eff4< /gmapID><Name>RG</Name>< Pictures>

<Text>As it happens most of the time for me the river is of a secondary interest. It's the road that follows along beside it for a way, that makes my day. Hwy 199, one of my happy Hwys. We'd probably better leave this right here before I get maudlin.< /Text>< Rate>

<UserId.>109948618296903725078<//UserId.><review>This is the most beautiful River I've ever seen in my lifetime, it's so clean it looks fake. I love the beautiful surroundings and how clean it is, the family element when everyone is at the river playing and having fun on the shore side is so much fun. It's a great place during the summer to go and barbecue camp and just hang out on those warm sunny days. There's many spots that you could go to that are all beautiful in their own way. I love that this river is the cleanest one and from what I've Been Told the cleanest one in the Pacific Northwest? I'm still very new to Oregon so my details might not be exact however I do truly love going to the river during the summer and can't wait to go back again.</review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Ranked as one of America, if not world's, clearest and cleanest rivers, the Smith River majestically careens through Northern California's Coastal Mountain Ranges carving gorges and flowing over bedrock until it meets the Pacific Ocean in one of the coasts most active estuaries.  Home to over 13 species of anadromous fish (fish that live in the river and ocean for stages of their life),of which include Chinook and Coho Salmon, Coastal Cutthroat Trout, Steelhead, and Lamprey Eel, to name a few.< /review>

I had not had a haircut for 6 months due to the pandemic.  I had already started growing out my gray hair before then.  It was long.  Nina cut off all the old blond and gave me a short haircut.  It dried out beautifully.  I love it.< /text>

<text>I was excited to get my son's haircut to start school day fresh. I was thinking it's worth the price I'm sure there professionals. I paid $18 dollars for a fade that they said they couldn't line up his hair in front and couldn't do line ups on the sides either. I did not say anything I just paid oh well what was done was done they messed up my kids exciting day for school I could of done a better job probably or even an $8 dollar hair cut place. Because that's what it was worth $8 dollar hair cut< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

$24 for a haircut is expensive. Plus add a tip. I usually get a haircut(Hairisma on Miramar Rd) for $8 . So basically 3x the usual price for haircut. Nothing special that my usual hair cutter does at hairisma.< /text>

I specifically asked the stylist NOT to cut the top and back, as it was already short and I only wanted the area around my neck and ears trimmed. I mentioned this more than once. She talked and cut and cut and cut. The result is an extremely short cut over my entire head. It’s as if she did the opposite of what I explicitly requested. I am VERY dissatisfied and feel awful about this horrible haircut. I couldn’t have been more clear with my request. I will never go back. I want to hide until my hair grows!</text>< Resp>

<review>Sometimes they’ll have good ladies but trust me if you get someone that doesn’t seem like they know what they’re doing, they don’t.

Well to start of was not very welcoming at all and was told that it would be a 30 minute wait which was not the case at all my wife and sat their for a good hour and that is being generous with the time and saw others come and go and apparently is more of a popularity contest rather than good business educate. On top of that the 5 women working their were very rude from the start and was not notified of if we were next and basically of a lot of patient customers existence and when I have been to other locations it has been a very nice experience but for some reason this location has a very bad problem with rude employees very bad business etiquette and no appreciation for its customers two very big thumbs down<//review>

<Text>I went in with long hair and came out with the most perfect pixie cut! I thought it would turn out horrible, but it turned out amazing! I look skinnier and I am so perky and happy! I highly suggest you get Torri for your haircut! She's brilliant! She has been at it for a long time, and she does a fast cut with AMAZING talent! She was so nice and helpful! I will be returning to her!</Text><username>Naia Williams< /username><Rate>5</Rate><user_id>112017877845247132656< /user_id>< Pics>

As ive gotten older my sir has changed and ive had trouble trying to find out what to do with it. I had the pleasure of meeting shea today and she did the best job ive ever had on my hair.

It was 50 min until closing 2 people working. One person was waiting and I walk in saying I need a haircut and they say they are done for the day. Never plan on going there again.< /Review>

Rainforest did an excellent job for us! We had a giant pine tree removed and multiple other trees trimmed and removed. Their crew was friendly, worked very diligently, and left our property super clean afterward! Alfonso quoted us a fair price and was very helpful and communicative throughout the process. We couldn’t have been happier with their service!< /review>

<Text>Alfonso’s team arrived as promised and did a really good job with trimming our tree. It was a large one in the backyard that requires quite a bit of work. They took their time and did a good job and cleaned up after the trimming was done as well.< /Text>< pictures>

Big thanks to Rainforest Tree Service for the excellent work they performed! We are very happy with the great job you guys did! They arrived early and worked very quickly and methodically to get everything down in the safest way possible. These trees were very close to neighboring houses and fences and the team managed to cut everything and topple it over without so much as breaking a sprinkler! We were very impressed with the work they performed and are really happy with the end results. They cleaned up every bit of the palm tree debris and swept up our patio and driveway too!
If you need tree removal, hire these guys! Fair prices, quality work, really fast turnaround from the time we agreed on the contract to the time it was done. I would definitely hire them again if/when we need more tree maintenance! I've included before and after photos to show their incredible work :)<//review>

<text>Great communication from Alfonso. He provided a very reasonable quote and was able to perform the work the next day. The quality of the work was excellent as well--it's like the tree was never there. I would definitely hire these guys again.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Date>1623620420944< /Date><review>I have used this company twice.  The first time they chipped a lot of tree debris from trees we had already cut down.  They did it the same day I called and very quickly.  The pricing is fair and service is quality.  They clean up and make sure everything looks great when they are done.

I also had them come out a second time and trim to palm trees for me.  Again, they responded quickly, their pricing was fair and they even through some extra debris we had a laying around into their chipper.  They will always be my first call for any of the services that they do.  I highly recommend.<//review>< Rating>

We had 4 Mexican Fan Palms & 2 mature Queen Palms pruned. The trees had not been attend to in well over 3 years and were in need of attention. Alfonso was extremely responsive throughout the entire process. I received the quote within a day. The price was excellent and we were able to schedule the work within a couple days.

The crew showed up first thing in the morning and immediately got to work. They were polite and professional, taking time to ensure all objects in the fall zone were out of harm’s way. The entire job was completed by ~4pm. Other than the freshly pruned trees, you would never have known they had been here.

Great value and truly professional job. Highly recommend- we will definitely use Alfonso & his team again.

After interviewing 3 other companies, I chose Alfonso to trim 4 very large overgrown trees because of his extensive knowledge, great reviews, quick response & fair pricing. He carefully listened to all my concerns for each tree & had good suggestions on what to do. The job was particularly difficult due to 2 trees were growing into power lines coming from my house & the neighbors on either side of me. Alfonso & his team masterfully worked around the power lines. They also trimmed a large oak tree growing on the fence line & hovering over the roofs of our 2 houses. I am so impressed with their skill level, efficiency & professionalism. They were all very pleasant & carefully picked up any debris in my yard as well as the neighbors. Thank you Rainforest Tree Service for doing such a great job!!<//Text>

< review>
I called a different service first and was told over the phone that because of the explained location of the stumps that they couldn't do the job. I called up Alfonso and I'm definitely glad that I did. We talked briefly and he came by only a couple of hours later to look at the project and provide a quote. I had 6 California Pepper Tree stumps on the side of hill and above a retaining wall that I was trying to get removed. He said his guys could be out the next day and get the job done. They cleared out all 6 stumps and trimmed a tree next to the front of my house. Great guys on the team who asked me how everything was looking whenever I came outside. A great service at a great price from an awesome local company. I'd recommend them anytime and will be calling back for another project in the future.<//review>

<Time>1596023353333<//Time><rate>5</rate><review>Alfonso and his team were excellent. He came a day earlier than originally scheduled knowing that I was anxious to get a dead tree cut down. This was a very large tree and it sat extremely close to a large living room window. He was so skilled in removing it without any impact to the house. They cleaned up the surrounding area so well that you would not have even known they were there. And, he did this in a few short hours! Also, he corrected a wrong assumption I held about why the tree died. He took pictures of the beetles that had killed my tree vs. a fungus that I thought may have been the culprit. He is very knowledgeable, efficient, and dependable. And the best part is that he gave me a very fair price! I highly recommend their services!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Very good and reliable service.
I spoke with Alfonso for the removal of my 2 palm trees. His staff showed up on time, cut down the trees, and cleaned up the area in record time.
Furthermore, we were able to text pictures and get the exact quote form Alfonso, the whole project was easy and safe. We would highly recommended Rainforest Tree Service.</Review>

<Review>Responsive, fast, professional, clean, honest and thorough. Excellent experience and I won’t go anywhere else for my tree needs. Alfonso arrived early for the estimate, came back 20 minutes later and the cut the trees down himself. Then he removed the stumps. Quick and easy and the value was unbeatable. Highly recommend.<//Review>< Pics>

< review>
We had three different companies come out to give us an estimate for the removal of a 60 yr old Brazilian pepper tree and a 50% reduction of another. They were able to beat all the other supposedly "discounted" quotes. I was impressed with Rainforest Tree Service because they listened and understood what I wanted and didn't try to talk me into doing anything less, especially on the reduction. They also were able to come & perform the work the same week. They were fast, efficient, professional, and had newer equipment in good working order. Their workers were very careful of our rain gutters, fences, gates and driveway. Their cleanup was amazing, like they had never been here. (Minus the missing tree in the front yard. Lol)  I would definitely recommend this company. As a matter of fact, the neighbor was so impressed he had them give him a quote and hired them on the spot to do his place right after ours! Thank you again for a job well done!</review>

Alfonso came out and gave us a great bid. He showed up on time with beautiful equipment. He worked fast, efficiently, neatly, safely taking down a 50 to 60 foot palm tree and hauling it away. He had 2 very hard working and professional workers with him that hauled all away and cleaned everything up perfectly. We had several stumps from previous trees ground also. The stump grinder was state of the art, remote control and made quick off all the stumps. After my neighbor watched the stump removal he hired them to remove 3 stumps also,and was happy with the price  quoted as well.
Would highly recomend this company to anyone. Took the worries out of having someone that high up in a tree right next to your house.< /Text>

I don't think I can say enough about the service, Alfonso was the light at the end of the tunnel after spending a lot of time on getting quotes and not liking the other companies for different reasons.
To summarize Alfonso is all in one, good customer service, knowledgeable on what he does (tree services) , fair priced , on time, professional and gets the job done better than what you thought.</text>

< review>
Called Alfonso out for a bid after reading all the 5 star reviews and I wanted someone with lots of experience and Liability insurance.  We had 3 oak trees and a 40 foot Pine. All of them were just about 5 foot from the neighbors fence and the overhang of all the trees were above his yard too.  Our concern was damaging the neighbors fence or debris falling into his well manicured shrubs and flowers.  Alfonso was Professional through the whole process and his price was fair.  He really knows what he is doing because he managed to down all those trees without damaging the nearby fence and when I looked over the fence to my neighbors yard there was no debris at all.  Showed up on time and all the workers worked efficiently and did a nice job of cleanup.  Even cut up some the wood so we could use in our fireplace and stacked it neatly.
Will recommend to anyone looking for a reasonable price with a job well done and fully insured.< /review>

Very happy with our palm tree trimming! Alfonso and his team were very responsive (quote and job completed same day), professional, efficient, and friendly. I would recommend this company.<//Review>

I contacted Rainforest Tree Service after searching online for palm tree removal. These guys had the best reviews on Google and in Nextdoor App. After having 2 other estimates to have two very tall Mexican Fan palm trees removed feet away from my house, Alfonso with Rainforest beat the other quotes and gave me a great rate to have 5 other palms removed as well,  including stump grinding.

On the day of removal, Alfonso and he crew showed up on time just before 8am and got right down to business. They had all 7 palm trees removed, 9 stumps grounded down, and everything cleaned up by 2pm!!

I went with Rainforest Tree Services not just because of their highly rated reviews but also because they are licensed and insured! Alfonso and his crew were extremely hard working and professional! Will definitely be giving them more business in the future!!</Text>

My wife and I bought a pre-foreclosure that had A LOT of over growth on it. I had tried to remove some of it myself but was feeling very overwhelmed by the cutting, the shredding and trying to burn or have people remove wood from the property. Than it came down to the big trees that I had no experience doing. I called their office and alfonso came out that day after we met with a few other people. He gave us an extremely great quote for the amount of work that needed to be done to mention he said he would remove the "bamboo" in the back. His team came out and had it all done in 3 days. Grinding and removing 11 trees about 20 yards of bambo and trimming up 5 trees.<//Text>

Alfonso and his team did such a great job! From the consult we could tell he was professional and handled his company very well. He arrived early and ready to work. Him and two others worked diligently and responsibly for 3.5 hours and were very understanding and flexible of our budget, schedule, and other requests. We have a few other jobs to do around the house and we will be using Rainforest Tree Service Inc. for all of them!

A huge thank you to you and your team, Alfonso.<//Review>

<review>I would hire this company again in a minute.  They were prompt, gave me an accurate estimate within my price range, worked fast and efficiently and cleaned up.  My neighbors commented on how friendly the crew was and how expertly they kept debris out of their yards.  Their equipment was top-notch and the chipper adds to their professionalism. The owner, Alfonso, was patient and listened well to my needs.  Great job!</review>< gmapID>

<text>I got their contact information from a neighbor and also got quotes from other tree removal companies.  Not only were they less money than anyone else that we contacted, but every step along the way they were professional and easy to deal with.  Thank you very much for the excellent job, and rest assured I will recommend your services to others.<//text></record>

Excellent tree-trimming service! Alfonso, and team, showed up on time and got right to work. I give them an A++ for doing great work and being very professional and friendly. Alfonso is also very knowledgeable and thorough and his estimate was very competitive. When they completed the job, the work area was even cleaner that when they started! I highly recommend this service! Thank you, Alsonso, for a fantastic job!</Review>

We had an EXCELLENT experience AGAIN with Rainforest Tree Service. This was the second time that we used their service because they did such a great time the first time. This time was no different!  Alfonso contacted us right away, gave us a great price for the work we were needing done and did a fabulous job of removing multiple trees on our property and cleaning up both our hillside, another tree and several bushes. The cluster of trees was very large and were situated on a hillside. They were professional and very nice.  He checked in with us during the job to ensure that we were pleased with the work his crew was doing. They were conscientious of safety at all times for both the workers and our home/property. They cleaned up at the end of the day and confirmed everything was to our approval prior to leaving. We HIGHLY recommend this company and would definitely hire them again for a 3rd time in the future for any work we may need done.<//review>

Alfonso and his crew were courteous,efficient,professional and on time.I watched while they worked and they were very conscientious of safety at all times.There was more added to the job than we had agreed upon and Alfonso stepped up and got it done. I was impressed at how fast the project was completed.His prices were better than other estimates I got. The clean up was good. I`m very glad I went with Rainforest Tree Service, I will hire them again.4/24/2017<//Review>

Alfonso and his guys were incredible! Boy do they hustle and get the job done professionally and are super clean and careful. Alfonso was so methodical about cutting down the tree and his crew scrambled beneath him to move and carry the branches out. He cut down a tree with ease that was dead and dangerously close to our neighbors house and my daughter's room. Then they tackled the giant tree in the front yard and it was down quick. I hate hiring people because I have bad luck and get screwed over and this time I was pleasantly surprised. I'd hire him again and will definitely be handing out his cards to friends and neighbors. Thanks for kicking ass Alfonso!<//Review>

<review>Met with Alfonso today to get a quote on doing some yard work.

I needed to lace a few trees (ash/camphor). I also needed to remove a few trees (large pine/large brazillian pepper/medium juniper/small star pine). And just do a general yard clean up (removing dead leaves and shrubs).

Alfonso was courteous and knowledgeable and gave us a great price. They came in at a very competitive rate and we chose them over quite a few other companies including:

Higuera Tree Care (next in line - really nice guys!)
First Class Tree Service (slightly higher $$)
Arbor Task Tree Service (slightly higher $$, just wanted to cut everything and now)
Select Tree Service & Landscape (most $$$)
All Access Tree Care (no response)
Moy’s Landscaping (no response)

Not based upon price alone -- but you can start to figure out who wants to just "remove" or take down certain items just to make more money (versus timing it right so you aren't trimming/lacing trees at the wrong time of the year).

I will update this post once the work is complete. These guys were really fast and will be starting tomorrow!! Looking forward to a decent yard.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Love this place!!  They always have the beat deals around hands down! I come down once a week and all the bud tenders are always so helpful. Today I had the pleasure of being helped by Alma! She was great! Told me all about the traditional promotion they had going on today! If you haven’t been, I highly recommend going here or to any of their other locations!<//review>< pictures>

Nice inside and i understand it was 420 busy but the person helping me was the only person helping other people and left me out for a while. Thanks for the deals. Just meed more flower options and more than an 1/8th im not an old lady who smokes a puff of doob before going to bed. Only point was more flower options at different quantities not just different qualities .< /review>

I've never given a review to a dispensary before but I just had to for this location. All employees, like Anthony and Desiree, are always nice and greet me with a smile! I can't forget to say they have a rewards system and I currently have 5 dollars to use for my next purchase. This is my new spot.< /review>

Honestly, I wanted to give Catalyst a 5. But I had a negative last experience because they potentially modified their policy, went back on their word, and treated me unprofessionally as a customer (I have an unfair medical issue from Jan 2020 preventing me from DL renewal, which I completely overlooked had just expired March 2021). The front desk employee brought the expired ID up when I came into the store mid March. They were very kind, helpful, and understanding. I was grateful Santa Ana Catalyst allowed me to shop that day and they extended my account until April 20, 2021. If you're a certain age over 30, Santa Ana Catalyst (according to their manager) can give you a 30 day extension if your ID expires. I went to Santa Ana Catalyst again 4-5-21 at roughly 12:30pm and was not allowed in. They went back on their word after I was happily driven down by my friend. Maybe they had modified the policy age minimum. The front desk employee, manager, and security guard attempted to justify their actions and became very defensive. The security guard told me to leave if I didn't like the way they did business. I understand the point they attempted to make, but they treated me poorly. Suddenly changing the rules and completely disregarding the customer is disrespectful, low class behavior. If you want to know how good or ill faith a person or business is at heart, observe how they handle and resolve problems - in this case, a mix of lying and customer service incompetence. I was upset and lucky my friend had come. I waited in the adjacent room while he shopped for us both. I'm also concerned over the front desk employee who was so kind to me and any retribution the manager at Santa Ana Catalyst might lay on her, as she was nothing but helpful and understanding. The manager and front desk employee working around 12:30pm on 4-5-21 displayed the opposite. They kept deviating from my point and didn't apologize for their screw up or attempt to mend it - instead they said sorry about my DL issue and tried to pin the whole problem back on me. They refused to do anything else. This approach/attitude can negatively impact the well-being of customers, team members, and ultimately a business. I appreciate everyone's efforts to provide kindness, quality products and services at Catalyst. I know it's not an easy battle protecting the company. 🙏</Text>

<Review>The Cannabis Specialist was friendly, knowledgeable, patient, and accommodating. I got the best possible deal on quality products, and when I had to return to the ATM to get money for my purchase, the security officer was attentive to the fact that I was returning to complete my transaction and put me back to the front of the line to get the same Specialist.

The environment was very clean and classy in appearance.

I’ll be back!</Review>< gmapID>

This dispensary has been my go-to for a while now, however, recently I bought 3 grams of stiizy curated live resin concentrate and I realized that the stiiizy products sold to me on 2/16/21 were FAKE. From taste to appearance and packaging, I noticed that there was something off and after comparing the products bought at Catalyst- Santa Ana to a stiizy live resin concentrate product from Stiiizy DTLA, my assumption was right! Check your products before buying from here because they think that buyers can’t tell the difference between the real thing and fakes, however that is not the case with me. I’m aware of what I buy and I will never buy from this dispensary again. It is not right for this dispensary to sell knock off products in which it can affect the health of their patient/buyers.< /text>

{'time': 1614126275636, 'text': "Hi Erick, thank you for your review and we understand your concerns. We can assure you that we do NOT carry any counterfeit products in our store. We are a fully licensed and fully legal dispensary that follows California laws and regulations. All of our Stiiizy products come straight from their distribution center through California's Metrc system, and that's with every product we carry. When it comes to taste and appearance, each batch can be different, because you are dealing with a plant that brings different results almost every time. You are always more than welcome to contact Stiiizy for assistance with verification or any other questions you may have. But again, we want all of our customers/patients to know that we are a serious business, and we would never risk putting your lives in danger by carrying counterfeit products. There may be many places out there that do, but we are not one of them."}< /response>

Honestly the best priced dispensary in the OC. TAX IS INCLUDED SO NO GUESSING what you owe! What you are told is what you owe, not this add tax at the end and expect these stoners to not react :) LOVE ALL the staff here! The product quality is amazing, you can find stuff @ 20$ all the way up to 80$ depending on what you want. Concentrates are ALWAYS priced right and your not spending 80$ on a gram unless you WANT to. I recommend ANYONE and everyone looking for a dispensary to go here. THE staff is always great (only had 1 guy from LBC store be indifferent but not rude)

This is my go to spot, all day every day. sometimes twice a day :)

Grams of wax - out the door from 20$-80$ if they have all stock. Only 1-2 brands i would steer clear from (420 friendly and honey badger). Raw gardens for 35-55, kings garden from 30-55, etc< /Review>

AHINOJOSA was very helpful in finding the meds that were right for me. Dude seemed like a genuinely cool dude. Picked up some fuzzies (my favorite) an half an OZ of Franken cake...both fire 🔥 I definitely would recommend coming here. The strains here are a bit more potent than the competition across the freeway. 🥸
Second visit was even better 🔥 🔥 🔥
TMILLER was very patient with me and helped me narrow down on some excellent choices.
Definitely will be my OC spot from now on!<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Put in an order of one item at 8:15 and got a text saying they were working on it and would text me when it was ready.

Waited till 9:35, no update. Drove there and arrived at 9:50, knowing they close at 10 and hoping they forgot to update. Well as I pull up, my order is canceled and the security guard says they are closed at 9:45 despite everything saying otherwise.

If you need medicine to help you sleep in spite of fibromyalgia, consider shopping somewhere that treats each order with the same importance and knows how to communicate.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dcd94d390b0e6b:0x4c1894a7f7c1b99d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've been a fan of this place for quite sometime now! But my encounter today with the facility has changed everything. I came in to return a burnt Stiiizy cartridge within 24 hrs of purchasing. Upon attempting to exchange the product, one of the managers took my product to the back and tested it to validate my concern. To my surprise their way of testing is by actually trying (vaping) the product, after the employee confirmed that to me, and said nothing he can do and it must be my battery that is faulty! How do you try a product during a pandemic and give it back to the customer. Unethical business operations!!! And throughout all my dispensary shopping experience yet to encounter this kind of service with the rejection to return a burnt cartridge. My battery is fine as I own multiple Stiiizy carts! Never had a problem returning a  burnt product before. Not coming back here. And definitely throwing the cartridge after they so (tried it in the back). Wasted 50$, thank you Connected for taking care of your customers during a hard pandemic!</text>

Lovely shop, great selection and the people are super nice and friendly. I like that they are very open to share knowledge and recommendations based on what you're looking for and the budget. Weed shops prices are crazy high but you do get quality for the money.</review>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>The front lobby is nice with all the beverage optiins and nice seating if you just want to chill. But the music was entirely too loud and the acoustics in the place isn't the best. Going back onto the sales floor, I was immediately pounced on by an outside sales rep. hocking her wares. This is great and everything, but I was not interested in smelling terpenes. I wanted to get in and out of there. I had looked online and chose a few items I was interested in. The sales floor isn't inviting like the front lobby. There are products scattered everywhere and it feels really sterile. A sales person, who was clearly high, comes over and just hovers. When I finally have to engage him, I inquire about the items I saw online. He didn't have any idea of what i was asking for, even though it was a connected product!! He gets on a walkie talkie and garbles something into it. Then promptly tells me they are sold out. Another sales associate comes and I inquire about 2 additional products I had found. (I went back to the lobby and looked at their menu online for about 30 mins.) This second sales person looked like she didn't know what I was asking for. I explained that their menu online had 3 items now that were sold out. She let me know that they have a hard time taking sold out products off the menu. I thought to myself,"Then why have a menu at all if it's inaccurate? Makes zero sense!" I was extremely disappointed and ticked because the whole trip was a waste of time. No one was friendly or knowledgeable. Their approach to sales is not the greatest. So, defeated, I go home and order from Kushagram, my go-to delivery service. I had what I wanted from them in under an hour. No sales people yakking at me about anything. No need to hunt-and-peck out items that may not actually be available with Kushagram. It's simple and stress free. The music level in the place was enough to make me leave. The whole experience with Connected didn't leave me with a positive first impression at all.< /Text>< pics>

Best shop in Santa Ana. Don't mind paying the taxes, still cheaper than most other places in my area. The old pal never dissapoints for the price. Friendly staff, great selection.</Review>

I think the guy showing me stuff was upset because I wanted to see a lot of stuff and smell it and that kind of took up his time so he gave me a bad deal while everybody around me was getting 30% off or a free gram for X amount spent, I got nothing but a hefty price tag, I will say the flower is good tho, that's where my one star comes from.
I guess my advice would be to choose swiftly and ask for any deal and just take what they give you.< /text>

<Text>Incredibly knowledgeable and patient staff. There was no rush and our bud tender (sorry can't remember his name) was able to answer all our questions, and help my wife and I pick the right strain for our needs. He also gave us advice on possible treatments to discuss with my 94 year old mother's Doctor.< /Text><gmapID>0x80dcd94d390b0e6b:0x4c1894a7f7c1b99d< /gmapID>< userid>
