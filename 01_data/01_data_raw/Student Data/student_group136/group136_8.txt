The staff have always been more than knowledgeable and helpful. Great place for newcomers and for long time kratom lovers.

This shop is the best!
The employees are super nice and helpful every time I go in there. The Kratom is consistently good quality and its always very clean inside. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a GO-TO place to get Kratom.
The shop next door is NOT the same company or owner, it’s a spite store!! They will literally poach customers from the parking lot. So tacky and unprofessional! Don’t shop there! Go to Bumble Bee</Review>

Been shopping here for over a year. Employees are friendly and helpful. The Kratom they sell is high quality - far superior to the junk you can buy at any local smoke shop or gas station.  So while you will pay more than at a gas station, you know where the money went when you take the product.

Recently, a competitor opened a new Kratom shop in the same building. They were actively trying to steal customers. I find that to be a shady business practice. I will continue to shop at Bumble Bee.< /Text>

< Review>
This place is the number one spot in San Diego for premium Kratom. The prices are fare and employees are extremely helpful. I am very picky about where I buy my Kratom and I've been a happy customer since they opened on day one.

On another note. A copy cat store has opened up next to bumble bee. They seem to be putting all of their efforts towards putting bumblebee out of business. They post fake negative reviews and in my experience make bumblebee customers feel extremely uncomfortable when heading into the store.

I live very close to bumblebee and I constantly see "the other" stores employees harassing people waking by the store front pushing thier product on them. If this is how they run their business and I can only imagine if they know how to properly sell kratom.

Don't go to "the other store". Bumblebee is the better choice.< /Review>

< Review>
I am an avid buyer from this store....my guess is roughly 800g to 1000g monthly? The staff are impeccable and nice. The product they sell is of high quality. However, there are some concerns I have with this store. Mostly revolving around sales tactics, misguided/untrue health claims, and a few other things. The store was updated and it is nice. ATM inside. They also sport a large selection of what you are looking for and all the tools.  Best place in the area to go if you’re not feeling those online stores.< /Review>

Ive bought kratom from this company before and I have to say I am always satisfied with my experience at bumble bee botanicals! They have definitely made a name for themselves as the best kratom shop around! This product is like none ive experimented with before- its very rich and organic material comes in various strains and forms(extracts,capsules,powder by the gram, etc.), something that I am not able to find anywhere! Would DEFINITELY recommend!! =)<//review>

I'm new to Kratom and needed to get off the pharma junk and this place was a life saver... very warm and inviting and they answered all my questions. They showed me around and taught me which color is best for my ailment. Feels good to finally break free from the chains... and I know I'm trading one for the other but it still feels good and this is all natural..
I highly recommend anybody dealing pain who might want to get off the strong pharma stuff to look into Kratom and then choose Bumble Bee Botanicals!< /review>

The fact that I drive down from the beach to la mesa to pick up my kratom -and don't mind it- says something about this place. Quality product and the young women who work there are great! Knowledgeable, professional & pleasant. I'm a loyal customer as long as they'll have me👍
FYI metered parking in the area, bring a quarter😉<//Text>

<review>You know what I find HILARIOUS is that Jasper Sampson has 2 reviews. One shining 5 star and one super negative one. The good review is for the copycat that just opened up next door to bumblebee. Looking into the copycat store is like looking into a mirror of bumblebee.  Pretty pathetic to try and ruin a very reputable place. I have gone to bumblebee for 3 years now. Not once have I heard yelling or cussing. Actually, I love going in and talking to the employees. They are very helpful and extremely nice. Bumblee Bee botanicals will continue to have my business as well as all my friends. I'll make sure I get the word out that the new kratom store is trying to ruin a reputation that precedes itself.<//review>< pics>

This place is great. I usually buy kratom online because buying it from a smoke shop can be sketchy product, but this place is way different. There's an extremely friendly staff that is also really knowledageble as well. This place is a rare find.<//review>

I dislocated my shoulder and am from florida and i do not pain pills at all .i have taken kratom before due to a car accident shattering my spine ao off and on i take remarkable herbs brand meng da.i was a little weary about taking anything else due to it being fake and dangerous.i had my mom go for me cause im in too much pain.my mom calls and puts me on the phone with a staff member and i cannot remember her name to save my life i wana say linda but I could be making that up lol.but she was so helpful and did not rush me to get off the phone she took her time talking with me about medications im on and me being a former opiate  addict (been clean 20 yrs 🙌) i did not want anything that made me feel that way .she LISTENED to ME and I cannot believe how compassionate she was and knowledgable about their products and about my situation.most ppl are "oh ok yeah I'm sorry u hurt indont know much about the kratom but here ya go that will be 100 bucks good luck we are busy gotta go" nope not with her at all. So my mom gets back and i have a few samples to try as well.i am now able to text and breathe deep as i was in so much pain i was holding my breathe .they farm their own kratom and shelf life is 60 to 90 days and that right there lets me know its not just some green saw dust with some chemicals  sprayed on it. I love this place my mom took pics to show me and the place is clean and very well organized and really welcoming positive energy.i will be stopping in before i head back to fl next week and take some tinctures and a few grams of other kratoms to try.the prices are perfect as well .the more u buy the less u pay and they have a rewards program which is awesome and a really good deal too I'm only one purchase away from a free half ounce and I only spent 60 bucks today and that enough to last me personally for maybe a month..maybe longer idk yet lol.anyways I feel great im not crying and getting depressed going from laying down to sitting to standing and just going nutts about the pain and trying to get comfortable.i am so grateful to her and them.i dont even know if they know how much they help ppl but with not one bad review that I have seen i hope they know.thanks so much again I appreciate yall from the top of my heart seriously.lots of healing and positive energy sent out to everyone .☺</text>

Yaya a kind helpful sales representative has helped my husband and me so very much she found the perfect kratom for us .The girls treat you like family, and very patient in making sure you pick the right strain of kratom. If you're looking for a better way than taking opioids for pain, look no further. Bumble Bee Botanicals in LaMesa is the way to go.

The best donut shop! I had the crumb which is light and fluffy donut surrounded by perfect brown sugar, crunchy coating, not too sweet, 85c. The fresh made creme filling in the bar makes a great combo.< /Text>

Thought I was going to get mugged. Very shady people hanging out front.  Selection of donuts was bleak. Place is filthy dirty. I think 7-11 is a better choice for fresh food.</text>

How can I get a refund for the $99.99 purchase to use the app? I downloaded it thinking I needed a 1099 then didn’t log on for months and then was told by my tax guy that that’s not what I need so therefore I don’t need or didn’t need their service. Looking for a full refund as I’m doing it the old fashion way with a tax person! I keep emailing them with no response on how to get a refund. Need HELP!< /Text>

I had them do my taxes for 2019 and unfortunately they missed some information when submitting my taxes and I didn’t get my complete refund but when I brought this to their attention, they were quick to respond and correct their mistake to the point where they paid for my tax amendment which many companies probably wouldn’t have done. We are all human and mistakes are made but taking responsibility for it is what they did which is very honest and the correct thing to do. Thank you very much!< /Text>

Keeper Tax has really helped me manage my expenses on the go. Having someone to text me asking about each transaction has saved me significant time at the end of the year when I usually wait to do it all at once. When filing taxes came around, I wasn't dreading it as much. Before, there were definitely things I would miss, but since Tax Keepers tells you how much you're getting back in the bank, it incentivizes you to stay organized. I highly recommend this product (which is also a write-off) if you value your time.< /Text>

<Text>Keeper Tax has been such a huge time saver for keeping track of my finances. I am an independent contractor and this helps me from keeping track of my expenses weekly. They constantly text you to keep up to date with delegating your expenses. I would highly recommend Keeper Tax! They even did my taxes efficiently and for an cost effective rate. I even face timed with the CEO. Their customer service is top notch.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1578616410740, 'text': 'Thanks Nikita!

<Review>I have always dabbled in freelancing but it wasn't until a few years ago I really only did just that...contract to contract. Each year during tax time I found myself sifting through receipts and countless transaction lists and STILL owing almost as much as the deductions I thought I would get.

So, after paying and paying I finally Googled "best freelancer bookkeeping tools" and Keeper Tax popped up. It was then that I tried it out for 30 days and quickly saw the benefits- from the texts confirming potential write offs, automatically sorting my expenses while eliminating the dreaded never-ending lists, boxes of receipts and keeping a separate spreadsheet...then learning they could do my taxes for free or a nominal fee was even better...then the rolled out the feature of calculating quarterly taxes and all of this for only <$10/month. Hell yeah! I'd be a fool not to.

The best thing about Keeper Tax is that when you receive the texts about potential write-offs and you respond...it's a REAL person...not a bot. I've sent happy faces and received them back. LOL. Super simple but knowing that a REAL person is communicating with you is the best.<//Review>< resp>

< Review>
This has made things so much more streamlined and hands off for me. My only minor issue is that sometimes things get automatically miscategorized due to their name (Sunday Motor Cafe and Ride+Reflect as car expenses when they're a cafe and my workout studio, respectively). It's nice that some things *are* automatically categorized as write-offs, but I'm having trouble with things being autocategorized as *not* write-offs. Other than that, streamlined, easy, responsive and accurate!<//Review>

<Review>Tax Keeper is great and very helpful. Anyone who does the "side-hustle" gig or if the "side-hustle" is your "hustle" then you need to get this. Unless you know what and what cannot be a full or partial write off, but if you're new to this game like I am, then I would suggest Keeper Tax. I get updates on all transactions that I do that qualify to be a write off and I get a weekly summary of them sent to my email. Link your bank(s) and that's it.  No need to worry, they got your back. :)<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I love it. I have it linked to my bank account so Caitlin, my bookkeeper does the write offs from monthly expenses such as my mobile bill or travel. Whenever there are unclear expenses she asks if it was a business related expense or not. You also have the option to file taxes right on the app! I recommend the app.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>No live person to contact. Paid for my expense exports, they never arrived, was told to check my spam folder by the system robot, then no other responses. Brilliant. Have been told for months my taxes would take 5 days to file, it’s literally been months. If you’re deductions outweigh your income, which is possible, your taxes will never file and you will constantly Be redirected to reviewing your taxes and submitting again, with no one to talk to. Seems like a convenient service, but ends up being a wildly unprofessional experience.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Rate>1< /Rate><Name>Caleb Wayne</Name>< time>

I love how it consolidates all my debit and credit cards, figures out what is a write-off and what's not, and then tells me how much im getting back or how much i've saved. Awesome program and would recommend it to anyone!!</Text>< pictures>

Professional and Friendly. Few for Keeper Tax app with the app it need alternative way or Option for account recover if your mobile is ever lost, change, or forgotten phone number you can login. At least an email that you signed up with. Also option to change your bank card or to add multiple, without needing a live associated.</Review>

I have a great experience every time I come in and dine. The cook is fast and makes the best shawarma sandwich in town. The garlic sauce on the side is a must have. Gosh darn delicious. The combination plates are also  good choices with several different options of sides, and all meats are juicey and tender. Staff is polite and very accommodating. The restaurant is always kept clean and there's plenty of parking on the side or the back of the restaurant.</Text>

Stupendous chicken, incredible french fries. The chicken is always tender and greatly seasoned, if Cicek was a shoe brand, he would be a nice pair of Doc Martens.</Review>

I couldn't stop eating it. The falafel was crispy and flavorful. The Greek salad was huge with  chunks of feta cheese, olives, pickled radish. All the sauces were awesome. Will definitely be making this place a regular stop.</review><UserId.>105310670471250924390<//UserId.><rating>5</rating><Gmap_id>0x80c29ca7882d964d:0x9e6e67de7b3baebf< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>We order from Cicek’s at least once a week.
The service is friendly and always accurate...
The chicken dinner is the best we’ve ever had, and the steak kabob has a nice marinade
and is very tender.
Wouldn’t consider going anywhere else for roasted chicken!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Predictable and dependable chicken with a middle eastern twist.  Always fresh and tasty.  Prices are a tad aggressive and the seating in the restaurant could use some updating.

Fast and friendly service, good option if you have a ha hankering for this kind of food.</review>< resp>

Hands down the best chicken I have ever had, it melts in your mouth it is so moist! Rotisserie roasted all day!  The hummus is so creamy and good. I love this place and come here often and turned my friends to coming here as well. They have great deal meals. The owner is such a nice guy and all the people that work there are great as well. As a little extra when you walk in the door they have a chalkboard with a positive motto for the day...< /review>

Fresh food. Great people. Call ahead for your order if you're in a hurry as it can take a while. They make everything from scratch.  The chicken is great. The rice and fries are amazing. That garlic sauce is a star. Good prices on combos and family packs. The kebabs are really good too. I've tried everything on the menu except the branzino. Only complaint I have is that over the years the shawarma sandwich has gotten smaller and lost some flavor. The price however has stayed the same so it's not that great of a deal.</review>

Awesome food and place to eat. Feels like eating at home and the staff makes it a warm welcoming place. Windows all around allows one to enjoy the scenery. Came to hear about Cicek's while watching the morning news and seeing the newsman enjoy his meal. Highly recommend it to friends and family.</Text>

Always fresh and delicious. Would give it 5 stars but the girl that takes phone orders usually gets something wrong, is impatient and rushes me off the phone and doesn't like to be asked questions, as if she expects you to know the menu. Kind of pricey but since it's good quality food I don't mind paying although they do have a good deal buy 2 chicken dinners and get the 3rd free<//Review>

<text>I had the wonderful experience of falling in love with this place recently. It had been recommended by a few friends but I never tried it because I do not eat chicken; however, I decided to give it a try since it did have some other non-meat choices.  SO happy I did. I ordered the falafel and it was one of the best I've ever had--if not THE best!  The sauces are spectacular--the pickled turnips a healthy and tasty delight. The place was very clean and comfortable and if all of this is not enough…the baklava is heaven sent!  Will be one of my new favorite places to eat for sure!<//text>< pictures>

The lady who took my order during the lunch hours I have been there is really nice. The garlic butter is super good. I got the 1/4 chicken and 1/2 chicken the times I've been there. It comes with rice and hummus and is less than 7 bucks after tax.< /text>

As I am a bit of a culinary coward, I always order the chicken but I think next time I'm going to get out of my comfort zone and order something different.  Something tells me I won't be disappointed.  If you in the SFV, stop by.  Worth the trip and you won't be sorry.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I stopped in for the very first time on a Saturday afternoon to pick up some chicken for a party. The girl who helped me was very nice. I ordered the Family pack which includes 2 chickens, rice, salad, pita bread and 4 sauces. The food is really good, it is comparable to Zankou and would say they can give them a run for their money!< /Review>< pictures>

I  stumbled upon this wonderful restaurant in Chatsworth. The chicken is probably the best, I really enjoy The tzatziki sauce as well as the hummus.  Feel that this is probably the best restaurant for chicken in the city, additionally the owners are so kind and nice it feels like home every time i come in.  Also the value that you get for the money is fantastic !</text>

If they let me in the back, I fear that I would devour all of their tender, juicy chicken...but not without dipping in to their stash of garlic-butter-sauce-stuff and slathering it on each bite. The staff is very friendly and non-judgmental, as one individual should not place orders for themselves as large as I do.< /review>

<Review>We love this place!! My kids used to call it the pink ice cream when building was pink. They painted it white now. The acai and pitaya bowls are more than amazing. The smoothies are great. And the icecreams are delicious.  This is our main to go place. It's very clean. The owners are here all the time and they are super nice.</Review>< UserId.>

<Review>I used to always come here & they had delicious ice cream & coffees also! I went today & was very disappointed! The ice cream cup was very small for an expensive price! It also tasted like old ice cream that had been there for days already! Will not be going back sadly!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

So fresh and still open during COVID. Green juice, mango & pinapple smoothie and pitaya bowl. I love that you watch them take the whole fruit and create their drinks and bowls.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>This place is superb. They have several different types of fruit bowls, including acai and pitaya and a variety of toppings. They also have fresh juice and other sweet treats, like Ice cream and shaved ice, not to mention Dole whip, which I assumed you could only get at Disney. The location is close to my job and is a wonderful place to stop for a detox drink or dessert. My only wish is that they open before 11 am.< /Review><userid>117533163142433888048<//userid>< user_name>

<text>Close to home, refreshing, and healthy! This place is simple, yet satisfying. I was very pleased with their Pichuberry bowl. The Pichuberry is from the Andes Mountains in Peru, it has a citrus/orange flavor to it. I normally get the acai or the pitaya bowl, but this was new, as I had never heard of it. It was different of course, but I'm glad I tried it, and I definitely recommend it! This is the only place I've seen it at, therefore I'm giving this place a 5 star!

Service was great, I didn't wait, and was pleased with the cleanliness. The decor and overall atmosphere is very nice. The pink colored building outside is also a nice touch. Gotta hand it to them for the creativity!

My go to for bowls from now on. And I can't wait to try their ice creams!</text>< Pictures>

Not too impressed with this place, I asked what add on's are available for their smoothies & I'm not sure what they said, my juice came out at room temperature and tasted awful.</Text>

<Text>This is our new favorite sweet spot!!!  Something for all members of our family - my husband likes boba tea, the kids and I really enjoyed the Italian ice with frozen Italian custard, and we will all be coming back for the açaí bowls and smoothies!  Friendly service, tasty samples of an incredible array of iced (I got the medium bowl with watermelon, lemon, and mango ices, and even multiple flavors of mochi and macaroons!  My husband and I will come back for a date night to try the dark chocolate covered gelato hearts ❤️.  Don’t miss this fantastic spot right by the Tyler Mall in Riverside!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I love Toi Moi! Been going here for a good while now, and they never disappoint! Great genuine people, they are always so friendly and they pay attention to detail. I usually come in for their fresh juices or acai/pitaya bowls, but they also have a great variety of options to choose from! Everyone I've told this place about loves it too! Everything is delicious it's definitely worth stopping by! Much love for Toi Moi, keep it up! 👍🏽<//text>

Love their Lavender Milk Tea! I've tried it cold with boba, and as a hot tea, and both are delicious~ NOTE: Toi Moi is NOT located at the Tyler Mall, and the map is incorrect. Its actually on Hole Ave, between Tyler and Magnolia, across the street from Arbys.< /text>

The price for the serving size of Italian Ice combined with the quality & variety of flavors  makes me come back again and again. It's never busy in the evening. Hopefully they get enough business in the daytime to offset the slow evenings and stay open for many years to come.</text>

This place is new and has a lot of choices! They have fresh fruit smoothies, slushes and juices. They also have a good selection of ice cream, Italian ice and custards. They even have pineapple dole whip which I love and never get at Disneyland anymore since the lines are so long. The worker was very nice and offered us multiple samples. I wish they had more flavors for the Acai and pitaya bowls though.<//Text>

<GmapID>0x80d94515b0e1792d:0x41929e22e83f9998</GmapID><text>Absolutely fantastic company when it comes to workmanship and customer service! We recently bought a house and found out our sewer drains were in much worse condition that we thought and all needed to be replaced. It was a big project and sounded like a headache as new homeowners but we are so glad that we went with Blue Planet.

Mike and his coworker Ricardo (?) were great the entire time. They showed up early each day, worked hard, made sure we had water connected by the end of each day, and always cleaned up before they left. They always gave us updates about what was happening and what they finished each day. One of the reasons we opted to use this company was because of the trenchless repair, which they did really well (and hauled away the extra dirt at the end too!). We had other work being done on the house at the same time which they were able to work their schedule around, which we appreciated so much. They were also very mindful and worked really well around our dogs, which was awesome!

All in all, both my husband and I highly recommend this company and wish we could give them more than 5 stars! They made a problem that felt like it was going to be awful dealing with pretty painless in the end!<//text></record>

<Review>Cast iron sewer line and laterals in my 1959 San Diego house were shot. After getting bids from multiple companies to hydrojet then line the existing sewer lines, I called Blue Planet for a bid to pipe burst the existing lines and replace. I'm happy I decided to go with Blue Planet. Project lead Mike was great to work with and he and his assistant Yosio are incredibly hard workers. They had a great attitude, listened carefully, and also worked smoothly with the city inspector when he came to sign off on their work. At a fair price, Blue Planet replaced my original 3 inch main line with a brand new 4 inch line, and also replaced all the laterals with new pipe. They also added cleanouts on both ends of the sewer line and poured new concrete where they had to trench. After seeing the condition of the old pipes, I'm really glad I went with Blue Planet's pipe bursting approach rather than epoxy lining—which would have just put a veneer inside very bad pipes. Keep in mind that the pipe-bursting process is messy because you will have to dig holes on both ends of your sewer line run and anywhere you need to replace laterals. But when the work is done it's worth the temporary mess  because it's a permanent solution that gives you brand new sewer lines no matter how old your house—so reassuring to know that my wastewater problems are solved for good. Would definitely recommend Blue Planet for your sewer line repairs!<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9sVAIVinR518KHU21VehDU0Pm6Be1f9ee9TBM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh5LI4U-x8gCd2YsreYTTSPwK72r6x0QGHqbn-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZDiknul9loRroyU6xVBX9wfCGYqRG-zUEsZ9P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1603301124589, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback and comments we are very happy to hear from you.'}< /Resp><gmapID>0x80d94515b0e1792d:0x41929e22e83f9998<//gmapID></record>

<text>We had a water pressure regulator unexpectedly fail last night in our garage, luckily we were able to shut the water off before any flooding occurred! We called and scheduled a service with Blue Planet and they were able to fit us in immediately! Miguel was friendly, professional and had the right tools/parts to get our water flowing again! After the repair was completed he pressure checked our system to ensure proper operation and took the time to answer questions. Thank you for the prompt response, great service and fair price!< /text><Response>{'time': 1608249752953, 'text': 'Thank you for your comments and feedback we are very happy to hear from you!!'}<//Response>< name>

Nobody ever looks forward to a sewer line issue, but that's what my old cast-iron pipes gave me. Blue Planet answered the call and showed up with the A-squad. Field supervisor Mike has the experience and knowledge to handle the most daunting of projects. They immediately began the overhaul, stuck to the timeline, kept the construction tidy, and inconvenience as minimal as possible.<//Text>

Mikey and the whole team saved the property I managed during a very stressful time dealing with a gas leak. They understood the severity and urgency of the situation and worked OT over the weekend to patch everything up, including drilling thru a concrete walkway and repaving. The professionalism, pricing and overall passion is why I won't go anywhere else for my property's plumbing needs. Thank you again Mikey, lifesaver!!< /Review>

<Text>We have a 1920's Bungalow in North Park and with that comes issues with the original sewer line that connects to the City's line.. mainly roots that grow in thru the connectors in their pipes. We've replaced our original plumbing years ago in the house but every so often, we still have some drainage issues and we always call Blue Planet. They are quick to respond and always prompt about getting a technician out to see what the problem is.
Tito is awesome and extremely knowledgeable and efficient at his job. He's a no nonsense no BS kinda guy and Blue Planet is lucky to have him as an employee and because of him, we'll definitely keep calling Blue Planet as issues arise.
Thank you for such great customer service and for employing such terrific people!!
Keep up the great work!!!< /Text>< pictures>

Had water main service line to house replaced. BRIAN, who did the estimate and the work was  just super. He was very professional and took a lot of pride in his work which is, unfortunately, so hard to find with many now a days. After talking with Brian for a few minutes I knew I was going to get a good job at a fair price so I didn't even try to get any more estimates. His work was excellent and thorough. If he is representative of all workers at this company I would not hesitate to recommend Blue Planet to anyone.< /text>

<Text>Manny and his assistant came to do an inspection of my plumbing and gas line. They were very professional. Manny was honest, and explain the problems to me, we set a start date for the work. They were on time, and worked beautifully. When the job was complete, they cleaned everything up.  I am so pleased with the job well done. I would hire Blue Planet again.<//Text></record>

Well we had an appointment today (12/22/19) between 11am to 1pm. Although, they called and said the guy was running late, he finally showed up after 3pm, and the price was way more than any of our neighbors paid to have their water heater replaced., which was within the past year. And, we all moved into our homes during the same year (12-2003) The guy kept saying this is a really old water heater (like we were not aware of that) what does that have to do with the price being way overpriced in my opinion, like he was justifying why it was going to be $2,800 or more. Well we will keep shopping around and have to go old school and boil water or going to a families house for showers. LOL< /review>

1/2018: We discovered our water heater was leaking water and contacted Blue Planet Drains & Plumbing.  Miguel responded quickly and let us know our water heater was failing and would need to be replaced (it lasted well beyond its lifetime).  Our previous install had been a do-it-yourself and wasn't up to code.  He replaced our water heater and it's comforting to know it was installed correctly and meets all the safety requirements.  We'll definitely call them the next time we have plumbing issues.

Update:  (3/2019)The thermostat in our water heater went out on a Saturday.  We called Blue Planet and they advised we contact the manufacturer of our water heater.  We did and they sent us the part.  Tuesday  we received the part in the morning. I called Blue Planet and we got an appointment for that same afternoon.  The tech showed up on time and my husband commented on what a nice guy he was.  I was happy to come home to hot water!< /text>

Very Pleased. The plumbers showed up on time. Whenever they went out to the truck they removed their shoe covers so as not to dirty them up and track it into the home. I have had so many workers in the past, from other companies, put on shoe covers then walk out into the parking lot, with the shoe covers on! And bring back the dirt and oil back into my home. But, my Blue Planet plumbers, removed their shoe covers each time they left and put them back on each time they entered.

Anyway, back to the reason they were here, my drain was cleared the first time and at a reasonable price. I'm keeping Blue Planet in my contacts for any futures plumbing needs. Mike was friendly and professional as was his assistant. Sorry, never got his name but he was every bit as courteous and professional. Thanks Blue Planet.<//review>

I called them yesterday (3/15/2016), scheduled to came in today between 8-10 am. A big guy, named Sean, came and started working right away. Very fast and efficient. I loved his little "bag of tricks". He was able to fit the tank into a very tight space. Plus, the price was way cheaper than the other guys...including Home Depot! We are a very happy customer.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Blue Planet was very fast and professional when I called distraught about water coming from my kitchen ceiling and light fixtures in our brand new home!! A gentleman named Matthew came out to check things out gave an honest assessment and estimate of the cost for repair. We held off on the services as I am hoping this might be covered by a builders warranty considering we bought this brand new how 4 months ago?! If things are not covered I will be calling Blue Planet for the repairs 100%. It's good to know there are still good honest companies and employees out there these days!

The technician was great. They had him out here the very next day for a consult and he was ready to do the job right then and there. I like these guys. There are a little pricey and that's why I didn't give them 5 stars. However, they do a great job and I would definitely recommend them.<//review>

Joshua and his crew worked here for 2 days and did a wonderful job. We had our old cast iron pipes relined and everything flushed out.  Their work was done in a professional manner. But they still were very pleasant to talk to.  They felt like family.  We would recommend them highly.</text>

<review>I found my phone contacts at Blue Planet to be courteous and informative​, especially Liz.  Tito, who came to do the estimate and subsequently the work, was very professional and competent as he solved our water heater issues.   Not only did he make me very comfortable with what items needed replacement, he used the opportunity to educate me about the process.  I have already handed out Tito and Blue Planet's card to my neighbors with no reservations and full confidence in their expertise.
My own family  is already planning on calling Blue Planet again, hopefully getting Liz and Tito once more for our next projects (replacing the water shut-off valve going into house next, as well as another water heater replacement at our small business).   Great customer service, professional and knowledgeable​ technician...thank you Blue Planet and Tito!   V. Deck and family</review>< pictures>

I worked with Tito on some heavily clogged outdoor drains. He worked for hours into the night trying to unclog them, and when it go too dark to look at all possible options, he returned first thing in the morning with extra help until everything was cleared out, and kept me informed during the process via text/photos. He was extremely courteous and professional, and despite the problem being much bigger than initially expected, he didn't charge me anything over the initial estimate. I would absolutely trust them with similar work in the future.< /text>

You guys really surprised me.Here I am, a 5-6 yr. loyal customer. I've sent 6 people to you, including my office. So, when I swallowed my pride, and asked for a discount on having a Water Pressure Valve installed ($675) you did not even call me back to decline.NO CLASS!
Well, I found a NEW Man, who installed it for $265 and did an excellent job. So good, 9, that's NINE of my neighbors used him INSTEAD OF YOU. Sense you guys are so good at business, I'll let you do that math. And, you also lost MY Three Offices. Greed is an UGLY BEAST!
Folks, this is how this company treats a 70 year old single woman. Too Bad, SOOOOOOOOOOO SAD! Bye Blue Planet<//text>< pics>

<Review>We had a water heater emergency and had called several plumbers to give us a quote to replace our leaking water heater. We had a mess and no water.
The next morning we had a parade of plumbers come to give us quotes...then Mr. Tito Dueñas from Blue Planet, came and he looked at our problem and knew right away what had to be done and he noticed that there were some things that also needed attention. He gave his quote and gave us the time we needed to decide what we were going to do. Once we decided to move forward, he got busy right away. Soon, we once again had running hot water and now we have a plumber that we can recommend,  also one that we can depend on if we have another emergency...</Review>< Rate>

I have called them because my sewer line was backing up. The house started to smell rally bad. The girl that answered the phone Alma was really nice all plumbers were out doing jobs she dispatched every single one and got Joe to come and clear the line for me. What I really appreciated was the fact that she called me afterwards to ask me how everything went. Wow that was impressive I will use them again for sure.<//review>

I hate to report a bad experience, but I must.  Moy arrived on time, but quickly tried to convince me that rather than a mere drain clearing with an auger, I needed to have him use a hydroflush to clean out the pipes as the house was old.  I told him the pipes were actually only 5 years old, as I had them completely replaced.  But he persisted.  I refused, insisting that I merely wanted the kitchn drain unclogged.
He seemed rather unsure of himself, and hesitant.  Strangely it was I who had to suggest I get a rug to protect my vinyl floor from damage by his very large auger.  He didn't think of this.  Then he needed me to supply him plastic bags for disposing of sludge residue.
I told him that my drain had 32 oz of liquid drain opener in it, from my attempt to clear the clog the night before.  So when he vacuumed the water into a canister, I hoped he would be careful.  But when he was returning the vacuum to his truck he trickled the very caustic chemical mix onto my vinyl flooring, and then spilled at least two cups of the liquid onto my fine wood flooring in my entryway!  He saw what happened and didn't appear alarmed.  I ran and got my own towels to clean up the chemical spill before it damaged the surface of the floor.  He was unapologetic, but obviously embarrassed at the error.
My kitchen floor was left with grime and grease from his equipment, and I was left to quickly clean it up before further damage was done.  He should have come prepared to protect the floor, as this work cannot be done without a mess occuring.  I definitely cannot recommend Blue Planet, after this experience.</text>

Miguel, sorry I had to create another post however, I need to point out some other concerns. If that is how you conduct your business when it comes to arrival time, then it's fine, Nick would've technically made it a little bit under the scheduled time. Had you explained it before I booked the appointment, I would've changed my time slot.

Then there's your Manager. Do you seriously think she handled this situation professionally? She waited about 5 minutes after I posted my concerns on the internet and cancelled my appointment without providing any reason. That's just rude, because I have been waiting the entire time. Had i known this was going to happen, I would've contacted another plumber.

And it is also rude to talk over when someone is already talking on the phone, maybe she needs a refresher on how to communicate with customers?  That's just simple phone etiquette, she made it clear that she didnt care anymore on what I had to say.</review>

Michael from Blue Planet was extremely timely, courteous, and knowledgeable. He arrived within one hour of my call and could not have been nicer. Other companies are a little skittish about working on tankless water heaters, but not Michael. I would highly recommend Blue Planet and Michael.</review>

They don't know what customer service is, and they don't respect appointment times. I had their technician Nick scheduled to come from 12-2 and he called off work that day, so I got a call at 0930 saying they can't send anyone else. So of course i had to reschedule again and this time I asked for the 10-12 timeframe. Their manager, Luz, was so disrespectful that she kept talking while I was talking and she was being rude to me. I was trying to explain that Nick is already late for his appointment with me and that I had made plans after his time slot. And it was rude to make me wait more when he already missed his schedule!!!

This company is obviously unprofessional and not customer-friendly. Too bad Google advertised this company first on my search, I should've called another company. Not to mention that they were offering me a crappier faucet for $160 or $260, like seriously? I opted to go to Home Depot instead and grabbed myself a cheaper faucet for less than $100. Don't take their offer for replacement parts until you've looked around. I know they're out to make money but they're abusing their customers.</review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I called Blue Planet to identify the source of a puddle at the lowest point of our property.  The technician who came out initially suspected a leak and spent two days trying to find it, to no avail.  Blue Planet apologized for the inconvenience and asked their supervisor Joshua to take a second look.  Joshua was extremely professional and capable in every way and diagnosed the problem within thirty minutes.  He then purchased the required PVC piping supplies and personally designed a solution that would ensure we would not have this puddling problem going forward.  Although I was initially frustrated with the two-day search for diagnosis, and the expense associated with that, I’m very satisfied now because the company found the problem, solved the problem, and did not charge me for the initial diagnostics work that did not identify the issue or further remediation.   If I have a problem in the future, I will not hesitate to contact Blue Planet Plumbing again and will always ask for Joshua because he’s a highly-skilled plumber, honest, and professional.<//review>

<Text>I called Blue Planet when I realized my water heater was leaking, Jasmine answered the phone and she was extremely nice and very helpful.  My experience was nothing but the best from the moment they answered the phone to the moment the technician replaced my water heater.  Great customer service, great pricing, great service. I recommend Blue Planet to everyone looking for an honest plumber.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< time>

<review>I called Blue planet to get my sink unclogged. They came and the guy (Mike) totally misdiagnosed the simple clog into a major problem. His attitude towards my reaction was very unprofessional and he even tried to charge me for the quote. He told me "You have to pay me"!!! I was shocked to see the lack of work ethic and the poor customer service he was delivering. I hope the owner of this company re-evaluates his employees and see the lack of professionalism they have. Total shame.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Really expensive and they don't pick up the phone. However place seems to have a quality product and do a quality work. Wish they'd pickup the phone though to save me time driving there to find out the high price tag.< /review>< Pics>

I needed a company to replace a film that was placed by a different company and malfunctioned. Imperial Works did an incredible job, very professional, very quick turn around, and definitely made me feel like they had my best interest at heart. Made great recommendations and did not try to overcharge me. Great experience to be able to find honest and high-quality companies like this one. I highly recommended them.</review>

<text>After placing an order for a new Corvette Z06 in January of 2017,  I had about three months to wait for it to be built and delivered.  I spent that three months researching all of the paint protection film shops in Sacramento and the Bay Area in order to find one I felt would do a good job installing paint protection film on my new car.  After contacting most of the top rated shops I could find I was surprised at how many well reviewed shops had such poor customer service.  Imperial Works was the only shop that was completely professional and thoruogh in both responding to my emails and when I spoke with them on the phone.

I received numerous quotes on the paint protection film and doing some vinyl work on my roof, and found Imperial Works pricing to be the lowest out of all the well reviewed shops I had contacted.  After speaking with one of my co-workers who had used Imperial Works several times, I finally decided that Imperial Works was the best choice.

I dropped my car off and spoke with David about what work I wanted done.  David took notes on exactly what I wanted and made numerous helpful suggestions to make sure they covered the areas of the car that were the most prone to to chips and scratches.

David and his crew corrected the factory paint then wrapped the car in XPEL.  They continually updated me with their progress and they sent me plenty pictures so I could see the application process moving along.

Upon picking up the car David went over the whole car to make sure everything was done to my satisfaction.  The car looked great and had no issues, however David made sure to let me know that I could bring the car in at any time if there was anything that was bothering me.

Well, it's been over a year since Imperial Works put the paint protection film on my car and everything still looks great.  I returned to get a stinger stripe put on my hood and a new front splitter wrapped in paint protection film.  David and his crew again did a great job and had my car done in a timely manner.

To my surprise, David had actually noticed a couple scratches in the black vinyl they put on my roof over a year ago.  The scratches were probably from the carwash, and were not David's responsibility to fix, however David completely replaced all the vinyl on my roof free of charge because he didn't want to return my car in less than perfect condition.  I noticed they also cleaned the whole exterior and shined it up for me, even though I didn't ask them to.  I have to say I am completely impressed with their work, and more importantly, that they would stand behind their work over a year later and fix things free of charge that wasn't even their fault.  I think you'd have a tough time finding a another shop anywhere that will match Imperial Works workmanship, pricing and customer service.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4fJRBWHOJlsEQ8ZAAic2Mr0k2L1g6Lj1pVDzs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

I’ve been taking my car to imperial works ever since they opened. David and Wesley are very knowledgeable when it came to my questions about tinting, paint protection, polishing and vinyl wrapping. The work that I had gotten done by them include clear bra, window tinting, light tinting, chrome delete, full vehicle wrap and the sport level ceramic pro. I have received nothing short of extraordinary service each and every time as I will continue to return to them for future services.< /Review>

Imperial Works did an immaculate job wrapping my 2016 Chevrolet Impala LTZ; Denzel was assiduous in ensuring that the finished aesthetic of the wrap was consistent with my specifications through continued telephone correspondence; they even ordered new emblems and lettering in lieu of reapplying the old ones free of charge.  I would highly recommend Imperial Works as the premier establishment for vinyl wrapping and window tinting for your vehicle in all of Sacramento County.  Thanks again, guys!< /review>

<text>Wes and team went above and beyond with my full vehicle wrap, tint, and some other mods!!! 1- the fact that I brought him an aftermarket bumper and a spoiler that needed a little extra work for it to function properly, Wes tells me they will do the work for me without any extra charge!!! What? Who does that? Imperial Works does! After the work was done, he walked with me to inspect the vehicle. Answered all of my questions, and taught me how to take care of the vinyl wrap. Would recommend them to anyone! Ps. After my car hit the road, many many many necks were broken. I specifically looked at peoples faces as they stared in awe.</text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x809ad1da2f8e1b4d:0xf1c3ed79ae54ebfb< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I took my 2017 Toyota Camry into imperial works to get the windows tinted. They did an amazing job. Two days after getting them done someone smashed in my driver side window. I had to buy a new window and then ask them to re-tint the new window. They took me in the same day. I was upset the whole day because after paying to tint the windows, I now had to pay for a new window and new tint. Wesley quoted me 80 bucks for the new tint but said since I was a return customer he would do it for fifty bucks. I took my car there and decided to wait. They were really busy and my one window took a while due to the new window being one off of the oem window. After waiting longer than I was qouted. Wesley said the work was on him as I waited longer than I should have. What business does that. Wesley was very friendly and the work was outstanding. It is so hard to find an honest business especially anything in the automotive field. Imperial auto has a customer for life here. I highly recommend any one at least check them out. I didn’t get my car wrapped but the ones I saw them do while I was there were flawless works of art.</review>

I stopped by imperialworks and talk to David and Wes about getting my car detailed with ceramic pro coating paried with xpel clear bra. After they finished I must say I have never seen my paint so shinny before. It looks way better than it rolled off the assembly line in 92.< /Review>

< Review>
I tried this salon on a whim because I need to remove/cover some vibrant colors in my hair (green) for a more professional look. It was a tough job but I left happy. This business is back open after the pandemic. I called to make my appointment. Olga, the owner, had me txt her photos of my hair in its current state and what I wanted. She was able to provide me a price for the service I was asking for. My hair was great. I even picked up high quality products. I plan to go back for all my coloring needs. Give this salon a chance.<//Review>

This salon is my go to place for a trim. The owner of the salon (Olga, not sure) cuts my hair beautifully. I tell her to cut a specific amount of inches and she does it perfectly fine!  I’ve had horrible experiences in the past where hair stylists cut a huge chunk of hair..opposite of what I request. Every since, I’ve been coming to her to maintain my hair long and healthy.< /Text>

The salon is inviting and clean.  The staff is friendly and welcoming. I got the exact style of haircut I wanted AND at a very reasonable price.  I enjoyed my experience and will recommend this establishment to all my friends.

< Review>
Dr. Kim and his staff are by far... the best professional group of people within the dental Industry. No other dentist that I've ever been to in the past comes remotely close to his AWESOME work and care for his patients. Additionally, his staff collectively, are simply the very BEST!!<//Review>

Ok! As a having self proclaimed dental phobia, the staff from the desk to to back office was great. More importantly I want to thank Thomas for his kindness, care, and consideration. Overall  he had erased all concerns with the work he performed. Just when I thought it could get no better, Dr. Kim came in and I topped it off with explaining the best path forward. I would recommend Golden Rule I wish I had only came in sooner!< /review>

Everyone there is kind and professional. Their new location on Carson st. in Lakewood is state of the art. Not that you go to a dentist for their decor, but who was their interior designer? The office is super bright with a modern feel.   I’m so thankful as soon as they were able too they opened up during the COVID pandemic because I was in desperate need of some fillings.  It’s nice to find an empathetic dentist that remembers your name and not just because they looked at your chart. My husband and I will continue to go here because a good dentist is hard to find, and Dr Kim and his entire staff are great at what they do!< /Text>< gmapID>

I'm a 60+ senior. I had problems with bleeding gums; I also knew I needed to have all my fillings replaced.  I've been to other dentists in Long Beach and received quotes as much as one month's pay! Fortunately, I found Dr. Kim and Golden Rule Dentistry. I had all my fillings replaced plus one cap - all for a very affordable price. Honestly, I never had one second of pain with these procedures.  Which leads me to say  Dr. Kim is the best dentist I've ever seen. I wish everyone in the South Bay would come to Golden Rule Dentistry: easy parking, good prices, very talented dentist and hygienists. .< /Text>

< Review>
Dr. Kim and his team are absolutely amazing. I always feel very well-taken care of after every appointment.  I haven’t had the best luck when it comes to finding a good dentist in the past, but that has since changed. I trust Dr. Kim and my teeth are happy. (:<//Review>

<text>There have been a couple dental offices I’ve used before but I’ve officially found the one! I have visited Golden Rule Dental Center a few times now and I can honestly say this business is here to stay.

Upon entry you are greeted by friendly receptionists who are also very friendly while scheduling over the phone. Both of the people I’ve had for cleanings are friendly and very efficient. They will spend as long as it takes to make your pearly whites sparkle again. The dentist and his assistants make sure that you are comfortable throughout the entire time you’re in their chair and I’ve been very pleased with the work they do.

With regards to COVID-19 protocol this office does a few things to ensure the safety of their staff and their patients. A day before your appointment you receive a call where the receptionist goes over a few questions regarding exposure and travel. Upon arrival you fill out a questionnaire and have your temperature read. Once everything checks out, you remain masked until you are in your room.

All in all, I highly recommend Golden Rule Dental to anyone who wants the job done well by efficient and friendly staff.< /text>< Pics>

It's about time I give Dr. Kim and the staff at Golden Rule Dental Center their due review. They've  been my go dentist office for about the last 8 years and have always been awesome. Because of how great they are I decided to keep them as my provider even after they'd relocated. No rude staff and they do a great job and they actually took away the fear i once had of going to a dentist. Personally, Dr. Kim has been more courteous than I could've ever expected a dentist to be when thinking of my experiences with other dentists. He plays very relaxing music, the procedure goes smoothly, and it seems I'm in and out before I know it. Not only do they deserve this review but I also recommend them and I usually dont recommend anything but food. Thank You to Dr.Kim and the Golden Rule Dental staff, you all have been the very best beyond imagination!!<//text>

The front desk helped me with printing out all the information I needed, and also took time to answer all my questions very patiently. I hope I don't have any more insurance issues and have a dentist for life, because they are all incredible at Golden Rule Dental Center.

The front desk ladies here are really wonderful, the dentist hygienist are great at what they do and Dr. Kim takes his time and clearly cares. Lastly, they don’t do procedures that are not necessary.  I highly recommend them for any adult or child.</text><pics>None< /pics>< userid>

A: Instead of spreading himself between two or three locations, Dr. Kim dedicates himself to this one practice community, and does it properly,
B:  Service is prompt after check in, and the place is squeaky clean.
C. There's no "up-selling" of products or services you don't need.
...Hey, when you find these qualities in a dentist, you don't want to change.   Plus he's got the latest technology, and, since he's young, the latest training!< /text>< pictures>

<Review>I don’t like going to the Dentist or Doctors in general for that matter but when I come to see Dr Kim and the team here I feel like I am visiting friends. Dr Kim takes the time to sit and talk with me and I am able to openly share what Jesus has been doing in my life. He also shares with me about his life and concerns. And we often close with a time of prayer. I pray that they are able to stay safe during this Covid-19 pandemic.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

My dentist for 30+ years stopped accepting my PPO insurance and I was in a panic. How would I find another dentist I  liked as well...and a hygienist? I started by asking friends and was amazed how many dentist would not accept my Blue Shield PPO. BS must have imposed a major cut on contract renewals! So I was forced to look at the list from my insurance and one by one after a visit or drive by checked them off my list until I went to check out Golden Rule Dental Center. l loved the front desk on the phone and loved everyone I met on my pop in visit. But I was still nervous about my first visit. NO NEED! My hygienist, Thomas was amazing, very thorough, understanding of my back and TMJ, issues and gets a 10+/10. He took pictures of the inside of my mouth, measured my gums and took x-rays, in addition to cleaning. He explained everything and took time to answer all my questions. Dr Kim was equally wonderful, kind and thorough. He too answered all my questions and explained everything. He even suggested a filling replacement verses a crown, which my earlier dentist had wanted to do, saving me a lot of cash. my daughter and husband will also be seeing them and I know they will agree.<//review>

I followed Doctor Kim and his staff, he no longer takes HMO plans so I had my husband put me on his PPO just so I Could continue seeing him.  Love the office staff Maria and Victoria just like Doctor Kim and the Hygienist go the extra mile to help you .   I recommend this dental office.<//review>

Great first experience here! A baby pigeon fell out of its nest near my house and we needed to pick up baby bird food and a feeding syringe immediately. My neighbor asked me to come by Seville Feed & Animal Supply to pick these two things up. I had never been here before but had always driven by and also had taken noticed of the stellar ratings online. I'm glad I got to experience coming here for myself!

I drove in and saw a lot of new outdoor dog houses and some other products for sale in the front of the building. I also immediately noticed a large white sign with red lettering in all caps that read, "STAY IN CAR. KEEP MASK ON". I appreciate that the staff are wearing masks and enforcing social distancing by having all customers stay in their vehicles, wear masks, and go through a drive-thru only. The staff are friendly and prompt with getting you what you need so you're in and out in no time.

A gentleman wearing a white cowboy hat and cowboy boots was friendly and professional when he approached my vehicle asking me what I needed. I got the vibe that perhaps he may have been the owner. I was there for less than five minutes and was able to the bird food and feeding syringe. I paid cash for the $13.95 total and asked them to keep the $0.05 in change. The baby bird food was $8.95 and the feeding syringe was $4.00, both very fair market price. I'm not sure if they accept credit cards but I feel like they probably prefer cash (I didn't ask).

All in all, I'm impressed! I hope to be able to visit as a walk-in customer sometime in the future once this pandemic subsides, as from what I understand, they sell baby chicks and I hope to raise my own chickens for eggs in the future. Until then, thanks, Seville Animal Feed & Supply!</review>

<Text>I found out about this little jem thanks to a suggestion from my dad, (the man is a genius, but don't tell him I said so) and I'm so happy to have come here. Its' an independent business that has apparently been in operation for over 40 years. So you know the are knowledgeable and experienced. How did I not know about this place before?!

They have a friendly, but not clingy, staff that is willing to answer any questions and offer advice. They also carry great products at a great price. I usually have trouble finding "Taste of the Wild" dog food, and they carry an awesome variety for a price that won't break my wallet. Which I appreciate. And there's the added bonus of supporting a small business, and therefore your community. Win!< /Text><userid>117626771248966564731<//userid>< date>

<text>One of the better spots around here. Honestly, it would be a 5 star if the tables weren't so crowded. Can barely walk through and if you have a party of more than 10, it can be a little frustrating. The pizza is amazing tho! Wings are great and fun for kids.

<Text>Pre-Covid, My wife and I used to go to Pizza Co. to catch a game over a few drinks and pizza.  The other night, we ordered carry out and saw that people were dining outdoors and TVs were brought outside for guests, so we wanted to have our dinner there while watching the game.  Staff were following safe practices but one of the girls named Ryan stood out to me, because I saw her carry a table out from inside when she learned we wanted to dine in. She has a Can Do attitude and her energy is perfect for this little pizza joint. My wife works in the restaurant industry and says she needs more people like Ryan in food service. Keep up the good work Ryan!<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOu47rpm1jWwlDD4PeMNX0TJCmNRFVCPk1ZHVMQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWcHEslS1czixni1TGHneMljXROeYDsXuzMKk8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVtUF1PIFWrJhEyZwnC1NA6Zz9iIlCma2wLzS0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBgCv_58KitsDQU0XaQsmvG9RXpG3Twfy48Hih=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPn3fLnjR0ebvAL1bMo4bY_agV8vGnBGE-_krv-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH4ag-hu4KYSrg9KsrI2KUeAna_une-bC2w6J1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeoYKlQTVqtbCAF_3m_CXFxj6HZ9nWDZ1HJVx0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp53P8aSjFalur0hCQLwnrmYtxS6lsc-kG6lDR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOY6r4PQF5KK_2fbveN61K7jC_XaGWFLCloo8Jp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN89lVfNUQ2DbWRmZYXQAPN98PQ7ky_S7Ul45h4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNN7lkv_TJHLYZbuAUoFzJCKaIygRClnYb5nXBL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpB75FDEEmnCykKJxtIlPsrZBeV7jxWQ09JjhD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPysvxulJt5msKymOzUg-iVzDBHiAVg-MMuS8Nt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPseS9za4PxWLPi_kysSzZEh5-A38fcyhdWmzXk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2w9bYoTA-sQ9AT9YZvuGXH5J5qOXpj0ar_DZA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg0g1DE8B0swO4lt5-wm35GvtqkL119f38vT4F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

We order pizza here almost twice a week- love their cheese and I’m from WI , so I may be biased since they use WI cheese. Lived in NY and enjoy thin crust, lived near Chicago and love deep dish- this place just has an all around quality pie. Good real cheese, sweeter sauce, and delicious cookies too.

Definitely order here when family is in from out of town. Fast delivery services too.</text>< pictures>

They aren't doing much social distancing or decreased capacity so if you want their mediocre food, you should order ahead and take it to go.< /text>

We had a second visit, at it was great.

<review>Feels a little impersonal like a fast food restaurant. The location near Phillips Ranch actually brings your food to you after you order it. I appreciate that level of service. Even Panera walks you out your food. But this location is like order, pay, move on, have a seat, but don't get to comfy, because your doing everything but making the food.<//review>< gmapID>

<text>This place reminds me of October fest for some reason. Probably because of the German beer hall table seating arrangements. Great for groups. Good  lunch specials. Personal pizza and drink 5.59$. I haven't tried the pizzas yet. Only the beer and sandwich. I ordered the hot meatball sandwich (tomato sauce was sweet and savory, meatballs were big and moist , topped with a generous amount of cheese. Crunchy outside soft inside hot bun). The sandwich lunch deal comes with a soft drink and chips, $6.15. Fast service. Young front of house staff. The waitresses wear  really short shorts, daisy dukes. Clean. Fun vibe. Good beer selection. 12 beers on tap. Over a dozen tvs.< /text></record>

Best pizza in chino hills. If your don't mind the numerous little league/ birthday parties and sports screens everywhere, I'd eat at the place. The crust is nice and crunchy whereas if you take it to go... You lose the magic crunch followed by the sacred long string cheese pull moment.< /text>

Loves this place!!! Delicious food! Not only do they have pizza but wings and the Italian grinder is the best! I drive a distance just to come here.. it's a little pricey and gets busy but definitely worth the wait. I recommend ordering online for faster service so you wont be sitting there drooling watching everyone eat there delicious food. Lol<//Review>

Winner! Started with the French bread cheese bread. Great flavor but know the portion is just enough for a party of four to have one piece each so you might want to order two. The medium pizza was perfect size for our family of four. Great flavor with yummy crust.  They also have a nice selection of domestic and a few micros on tap. Also a game room for the kids.< /review>

< review>
It's unfortunate that this company doesn't have any concern about it's  handicap guests. The management allows their delivery boys to park in the handicap spot ! The company doesn't apologize for it either . It's a shame . Until someone becomes handicapped themself, only then will they understand . We will spread the word.  They let us know, our business was not important to them !< /review>

Great Pizza Bad Service
Despite the bad service I've experienced the food was great.  I lived down the street and we would order our dinner at least once a week if not stop in every other week to let the kids play.  In addition we would also go for kids team pizza parties.  My experience has been that they've given my order away 2x due to placing orders on the counter and leaving it up to the customers to be honest in picking up their pizza.  Both times that this has happened to me they look at me like its my fault and after showing them my receipts and explaining to them it wasn't my fault someone got to the counter quicker than me they replaced my food but I had to wait.  In addition, on my last visit to what was my favorite pizza spot, my son and nephew were saving a table for us.  Now they were supposed to be sitting down but of course it doesn't always work that way.  My son tripped over a little girl that he didn't see laying on the floor and broke his nose on one of the benches.  All this took place inside the restaurant.  We stood there for about 10 minutes before we could get his nose to stop bleeding than I took my son to the ER.  Do you think that any of the staff came out to see if everything was ok or if there was anything that they could do to help?  Nope.  Of course all the customers around us asked if he was ok...I mean how could they not my son was crying and blood was gushing out.  But the staff...hmm...I got a bunch of stares by the young staff and I don't think the owners had a clue what was going on.  I  understand the food is great and this is a busy little spot but come on...In addition the wife, or at least I think it was the wife of the owner snapped at my husband.  She was upset because he changed his order of beer, which we had asked at the time of the order but the staff didnt make the change before she poured it.  Not our fault.  Maybe they just can't handle the stress of making money.<//Review>
