<review>Came here with my husband and 3 year old ASD son.  The wait wasn't bad on a Saturday morning.  We were seated, greeted with a smile, offered drinks, and made our order quickly.  Food came out and it was delicious!  My son is a picky eat and he ate happily ate his smiley face pancake with banana and sausage and egg.  My waffle was delicious.  The bacon is super yummy and a thicker cut.  My son even stole bacon off my plate.  The jam that comes with toast is perfect - not too sweet.  My husband loved his blueberry french toast.  The service was fabulous, food delicious, and you can't ask for much more from a restaurant.<//review>< pics>

Great place for breakfast, fast & friendly service. Their home made sausages are excellent as well as their Danish aebleskiver.< /text>

<review>Valhalla is a great place for breakfast or lunch, with a wide assortment of dishes, including several Danish ones. Open only for breakfast and lunch, with typical Danish food and wonderful standard breakfasts. It's where Visalians congregate because of the friendly atmosphere. Also, a small gift shop where you can find unique things. Located on Center St.,which is downtown, but off Main.<//review>< Name>

<Text>I got the plate with eggs, sausage and pancakes, I got regular butter milk pancakes because I wasn't sure our toddler would like the other pancakes because she's such a picky eater. The pancakes were very nice and fluffy. The eggs and sausage were good, but you can't go wrong with sausage and eggs.<//Text><rating>5</rating><pictures>None< /pictures>< time>

< Review>
It was my 1st time visiting and I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is connected through a quaint little gift shop. The wait wasn't long for a Saturday morning (10ish) We browswd through the store filled with cute gift ideas of all kinds from tea sets to baby gifts. The restaurant atmosphere was very welcoming. It felt like being at home, well except you don't have to do the cooking or cleaning. Our server was amazing, she was very friendly and helpful. The fresh squeezed orange juice was to die for. I ordered the Viking combo: French toast with eggs, bacon and sausage with a side of Country Home Fries. I would definitely recommend  the potatoes, the flavors were amazing. Lastly we shared an Aebleskiver, which was very yummy. Overall it was definitely a great experience and will be returning again every chance I get.<//Review>

Stopped by on a whim for something different.   This place is great.  We had the lamb kebabs, and they were tender and well cooked on the grill.  The owner (I think he was the owner) was a great guy.   Super friendly and patient with us as we were not familiar with the cuisine.  Overall, a great experience.  We will be back<//review>

Good food, good value.not sure if the new technology was the way to go. I think it took away from the original family practice of friendly in town service.staff and waitressing a little bit lost and less interested in customer service.<//text>

Valhalla's is our family favorite for breakfast. You can't miss with the fresh squeezed orange juice, aebelskivers, waffles with fresh strawberries or Danish pancakes.
The staff is friendly and does a great job to ensure your meal is perfect.  Oh, and don't forget a fresh pecan roll for later in case you have already eaten too much delicious food.< /text>

Eat at Valhallas on a regular basis. Took a friend's kindergarten son with us the other day. He marched around the gift shop, inspecting all the goodies. Then he declared, "I like this place!" Food is fantastic; service is exemplary; prices are fair.</text>

I hadn't been to Valhalla for years. Now I remember why. I ordered bacon and eggs. My medium eggs were fried to a golden brown, so crispy you could not cut them. I sent them back, but the replacement eggs weren't much better. I asked for crispy bacon that came burned. I had coffee, and had to ask for a refill. Our server Carolyn (I think that was her name) had passed our table twice with the coffee pot and never offered a refill. I happened to look in my cup after I had drank most of it, and realized the cup must have been dirty to start with as white gunk was floating around in it. Yuck! The server was very pleasant, but not on top of her game. Our abelskivers were way over done. However, my husband's ham slice was very tasty. Just a sad experience. Won't be going back.<//text>

<review>My sister ordered eggs, sausage and hash browns. I'm pretty darn sure the sausages they served were Aidells chicken apple sausages. They did not look at all authentic. I ordered a bowl of eggs over a biscuit with gravy. It was your standard fare. Nothing spectacular. The Aebleskivers we shared were plain and a bit dry.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Very nice, great service, very good food. I like Danish atmosphere here! A bit expensive though. They have a dining room for families with kids with some toys and I think 3 dining tables. We were the only family in the kids room so it felt very private and quite, like you're at home.< /text>

Have always enjoyed breakfast here, thought we'd try lunch. Was abit disappointed,  fish was well over cooked and presentation just looked tired. Gaps on the plate due to small portions,  french fries were sparse. The food tasted ok, just no comparison to their breakfast portions, presentation etc.
I love this place don't get me wrong, staff is always super friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is wonderful. Just feel lunch could use some improvements.<//review>

I adore this place.  The gift shop has the classiest, girliest items, and I keep buying jewelry for myself and for gifts for other women there.  Though, I do intend on getting myself a pink tea set from there one of these days.  The restaurant part of it...is amazing!  I like the Valhalla Breakfast Special, which consists of two eggs (well-cooked for me), 2 aebelskivers, and medisterpolse (homemade Danish sausage).  Really huge portions and really delicious, authentic, home-made food.  An absolute treat.  Also, the owner, Kim, is always so kind when I happen to run into her, when she's not cooking up a storm in the back...great service, interesting decor, and wonderful food.  I'm a tried-and-true kind of a girl, so I plan on sticking with the Valhalla Breakfast special for a long time, but I do want to try the Belgian waffles there!!!</Text>

Truly the best Danish inspired cooking in the area. Breakfast and lunch, can't beat the prices. And the homemade pies are "to die for".< /Text>

<Review>Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. I highly recommend Valhalla. Every other week, I meet up with my Deacon friend and enjoy a delicious breakfast. Most times, we feast and visit with the time flying by. Try the Rande Omelet. It is absolutely tasty. The coffee is good too. Not to mention the Scandanavian pancakes. Yummy. And like the fives stars say---I Loved It!< /Review>< pictures>

A gem of a place in downtown Visalia. Great food, even if you are a vegetarian or vegan. If you are a T Rex you will definitely love it. Tons of choices for meat eaters.

The gift shop is cool too. Reminds me a little of Cracker Barrel restaurant in that sense. For those of you who are down with our Southern family and know what Cracker Barrel even is.

My point is, this place is definitely worth a visit if you are an out-of-towner and definitely worth a visit if you are an in-towner.

Tell them this google review sent you. You won't get a discount, nor will I get anything, but it's something different to say rather than the typical standard ole "Hi, I'd like a table for 5 please"

If you're not saying HI or PLEASE to begin with... you know what... never-mind... not going to get preachy. This review is not the place.

Long story short, go check this place out. Worth a visit. Even if you are a brontosaurus like me.</text>

I came here for breakfast with my husband at the time, a Mexican man with a thick beard whose ethnicity was vague. It was the day after the Paris shooting. We were waiting in line and the host, an older white man, said to the veteran in front of us that he might have to go back to war. Then he stared down my husband, looked him in the eye, and said "that's what happens when you let just anyone in." We were dumbfounded and left immediately. I was looking forward to local Swedish food, but I would rather drive to Kingsburg for Swedish food than give Valhalla my business.<//review>

We stopped here per a local recommendation and were not disappointed. By a stroke of chance, five of our 6 family members ordered the Nordic Burger. We unanimously agreed that it was delicious, especially paired with sweet potato fries. Strawberry lemonade was also a hit. We didn’t have the chance to try dessert, but there were some pies available when we arrived about an hour before closing. Service was very friendly and quick, which is an extra plus if you’re on the way to the National Parks or another destination.</text>

(Translated by Google) An oasis for those who can not see sandwiches, chicken etc. for breakfast anymore! Delicious pancakes (dutch pancakes), waffles, etc. with fresh strawberries and cream, served with freshly squeezed orange juice. Super Service. From the outside nondescript, family-run breakfast restaurant, which belongs to no chain. Absolutely recommended!

(Original)
Eine Oase für alle, die keine Sandwiches, Chicken usw. mehr zum Frühstück sehen können! Leckere Pfannkuchen (dutch pancakes), Waffeln usw. mit frischen Erdbeeren und Sahne, dazu frischgepresster Orangensaft. Super Service. Von außen unscheinbares, familiengeführtes Frühstückslokal, das mal keiner Kette angehört. Unbedingt zu empfehlen!<//text>

< review>
THE ULTIMATE, ABSOLUTELY SUBLIME CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA. I’m sitting in my car eating this just outside Indus and my head is exploding. Tastebuds are in ecstasy! I’ve loved indian food since the 90s, and I’ve searched great indian food in the food mecca’s I’ve lived in, NYC, LA, and SF. I’ve also been to India. I had a craving for tikka masala and this lil’ unassuming spot turned up near me on google maps. I appreciated its authenticity seeing their kitchen. But wow wow wow. Nothing prepared me for literally THE PERFECT TIKKA MASALA!!!

* I’ve tried the korma which is my 2nd favorite indian dish and it was nothing special at all. So all I can gush over is the tikka masala ;)</review>

What I luv'd most was I able to get a meat curry, vegy side, rice and naan all on one plate for $10. Amazing this day n age, especially for a single eater.
The food was gr8 and fresh.
I'm book marking this place and coming back for sure!</Text>< rating>

<text>Ive been a loyal customer here for almost 20 years. I support Indus because of the necessity for quality halal meat and a great restuarant. Last Thursday I placed an order over the phone. When I arrived to pick it up I was shocked to find a lady employee  belittling a new employee even after he apologized for a mistake.  She was loud and unprofessional and I was embarrassed for the new hire. She went on a rant for  alleast 10 minutes while all the customers were looking at her in amazement.  To make matters worst she stated that her rant was about $1.50 mistake where a customer was overcharged.
I was in shock regarding the claims she made and her verbal assault was due to such a small discrepancy.
Character counts.
Indus you have never failed me but you need to address the leadership opportunities on the restaurant side of the business.< /text><username>Omar Saddiq< /username><userid>101918517983313667439<//userid></record>

It's been michelin-star rated and it is definitely something that you have to try if you're going to be in the Berkeley area. It's so cozy spot that allows you to get home style food without the hustle and bustle of other restaurants. They have excellent prices as well!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Very good, and reasonably priced. Meals range around ~$10, which seems good compared to most Berkeley places. Naan is incredible, and the Paneer Masala was fairly good. Recommend it to anyone in the area. Parking can be difficult so it may be a bit of a walk. As long as you do not expect the service or ambiance of the french laundry, you will be happy with your meal.</Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>I visited this restaurant in the past and tried biryani - it was good. Yesterday, I went back and thought I'd try something different so I ordered Lamb Chops, nan, and dal makni. Lamp Chops were served within 6 minutes from the moment I ordered it. They didn't look good, looked like burnt, tasted bitter / awful and were not cooked properly. Other Pakistani/Indian restaurants normally take at least 20+ minutes to cook them properly. Nan and dal were OK thou. After having lamp chops (about an hour or so later), I felt like vomiting at work. 24 hours later today, I have fever, soar throat, upset stomach! I called and notified the person who served me, she was nice and apologized and wanted to return my money. I declined.
I'm NOT looking forward to going back to this restaurant!
I want others to have better experience.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I will never ever never go to that place again

Bad food and service. I went to the place with my family but experianced a trouble experiance: first the chana masala plate had hair. 2nd the food was so spicey  that I had upset stomach, finally they charged 20% surcharge without notifying me due for being a party of 5 (including 1.5 year old baby)<//Text>

<text>This restaurant is fantastic. Dad has been bringing me here ever since I was young, and I use it as a benchmark for quality of other restaurants. The price is extremely disproportionate to the quality of food, and they even have a Michelin star. It may seem somewhat older and run down, however don't be offput by that and give it a shot.<//text>< pics>

I love this place! The did is not only consistently amazing, it's unpretentious, high quality, well priced and popular with locals. I anyways have the children boti.
Plus, if you want to buy the ingredients to cook Pakistani food at home, including halal meats, just go next door.< /Text>

Very good food. The combos are also a great deal, though they used to be a bit more flexible in changing the combos.< /text>

<Review>Giving it a 1 star, because I can't give it 0.

New management is worse than horrendous: rude and not interested in your business.  On top of that, the quality of the food has plummeted.

My father had the fish curry for lunch, and was sick a few hours later.  We had to throw away the left-overs.

On another day, we arrived for a simple desert (kulfi--Pakistani/Indian ice-cream) at 9:12 PM, about 20 minutes before closing.  They said that since it was past 9:10, they wouldn't serve us to sit down.  Because of 2 minutes!

Sadly, this place has dropped like a rock: It used to be my go-to recommendation, but now I can only recommend that you stay away from it!</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
This is my go-to place for Pakistani food. It's connected to Indus Village Meat & Grocery store next door. They use the halal meat and serve it at the restaurant. I believe the owner owns both places. I love their Chicken Tikka Masala dish and their Biryani. The Kebab appetizer was pretty delicious. Take advantage of their free chai. Small joint - not the cleanest if you're looking to dine in. I usually do take out.<//Review>

Easy access. Manager and staff are friendly and helpful. Both cold and warm sandwiches are available. Juicy and yummy sandwich with fried egg added. Great lunch option. Recommended</review>

When we came in, there were no customers in line. We ordered a caramel frappe and went off to the side. Two more customers came in after us and ordered sandwiches. Both customers received their sandwiches before we ever got our frappe. At least 20 mins have gone by at that point and our frappe was no where to be seen. I had to actually go up and ask about them and it was revealed they had not even started. When we finally did get the frappe, it was filled to the top. No whipped cream, no caramel drizzle and was mixed with so much ice, you could barely taste anything.<//Text>

Sandwich Lee , a cheap copy from the Cerritos Location , the sandwich are totally delicious, fresh in every bite, but the problem is the thay tea , one day is awesome, other day not, some days offer bobba others do not have it,  like depending from the person that is preparing , plenty parking , nice employees they try at maximum to address you with the menu</Text>

<text>The coffee is usually good and on point when the right person makes your coffee here, customer service needs some boosting.... Not to say other Lee's are not great because in fact they are and the issue seems to be here with staff

I had the worst cup of coffee today from this place thanks to the a.m staff 👍<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2cd3dc7da4869:0xc9c00a5503e2a402</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I called an hour before to place an order for 2 platters. I had to repeat my credit card several times over the phone which was irritating. I got there and my order wasn't ready. In fact, they didn't even start my order! There was a lady who had been waiting for their order for an hour! I have a lunch meeting with a some doctors and now I'm going to come in late looking like a jacka$$ because they dont know how to complete orders on time. Terrible customer service and terrible business operations!< /Text>

Lee's Sandwiches are the best I've ever tasted. The bread is made perfectly and the bbq pork is my favorite. They also have European style sandwiches for the less adventurous. The hype is real!</Review>

The iced coffee is like no other I've had before. It's rich and creamy and ends on a familiar and not unpleasant bitter note.

If you want to try the Asian sandwich side of the menu, but don't know where to start the #4 grilled chicken is a great option. Chicken has a slight teriyaki flavor going on that's balanced by the crunchy pickled veggies, jalapeño, onions, and cilantro. Yum all around.

And I finally tried the macaroons! There was no label so a blind choice turned out to be vanilla. So light and the filling very creamy.

All in all worth a trip for a light and energizing lunch.<//review>

This location is a pretty good Lee's. Getting into the shopping center can be challenging sometimes, but the sandwiches are good and the place is clean. Sometimes they make sesame balls which I think are the best baked food the have. It's a good spot to sit and chill a little bit.<//text>

Went in yesterday evening and the lady not helpful at all. I had to tell her my order three times, which at that time she was talking to another employee. Not sure if she was arguing with him or what but in any case, I don't think I will be going back anytime soon. They need to improve customer service for sure. On the bright side the coffee was good.</review>

It's got some good breakfast sandwiches. I suggest you call in your order so you're not waiting forever. Especially if you ordering more than 4 items.<//Review>

<review>I really like Lee's Sandwiches, and have been to many of their locations in the past 10 years. This one has the worst bbq pork I've ever had. The meat was nothing but warm fat. Yuck. Very disappointing since I was really happy to work near one of my favorite sandwich shops.< /review></record>

We're fans of Lee's in general, but this location had already started to clean up before closing when we arrived and took care of us like it was midday, fixing the soda machine so we could get what we wanted and offered to make egg rolls fresh if we wanted.</Text>

I always go here when I visit my friend since there aren't any Lee's near my home. I usually order the vegetarian Banh mi and coffee. Both are delicious. The staff is very friendly too. My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a little long despite the low traffic.< /Text>

I love the pork bbq sandwich and the iced latte americano. I was really enjoying my sandwich until i had a bite of something really spicy that it burned my tongue and lips! Good thing i also had a latte with me. Not sure if its some random chilli or they were mad at me and put something really spicy in the thing.  Overall, its still a good experience.<//Review>

This place is terrible!!! The staff is very nice but their food is poorly put together I ordered Spring rolls which I had to wait 15 mins for because they were supposed to be fresh after waiting the 15 mins I went home to enjoy them but yet I got brown wilted lettuce and my spring rolls were drenched in water so gross let's just say I will never go back to that location.</Review>

Really really bad restaurant here. The bread had a weird taste and the meat did not taste fresh. But I was surprised enough to find a banh mi place in Lakewood, guess the people here are stuck with it until they head out to Rosemead/Monterey Park area.<//review>

Friendly staff, but lot isn't large compared to most RV lots. It appears they have one of each major model on display, that are all open for viewing. Most here appear to be the 4WD off road style Mercedes-Benz and Roadtrek models and a few of the large motorhomes too.</Text>

Great place to shop for either used or new RVs. I went new. Super happy with rig. Ask for Dave K something when dealing with sales guys. That guy knows his stuff. He was a big reason I purchased from Conejo Rv. He’s got red spiked hair. I will go back next round of upgrade. Thanks.< /Text>

Buying an RV can be a nerve wrecking experience, but the guys at Conejo made us feel on safe grounds. No rush, no pressure, but all honesty and transparency. We where mostly dealing with Jim, and he really took his time to help us through the whole process, both before the sale, but certainly also after. That's what really counts. We got ourselves a really nice RV that we will be enjoying for years to come.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>This is a professional and courteous operation.  ALL the staff were refreshingly helpful.  Sometimes I wondered who my salesperson was because they were all so terrific.  Rick performed on every promise and guarantee.   They were all knowledgeable and made every effort to answer my questions (no matter how trivial).  The crew worked hard to get the Rv ready for inspection before our warranty issued.  Even our independent inspector was impressed by the quality of our coach and its cleanliness.  Between Sergio's thorough inspection and maintenance and Kirk's representation on our behalf, our coach passed the first time with flying colors. We have bought many RVs over the last 15 years.  By far, our best experience.  Highly recommend.  We live in Oregon but this dealership was worth the trip.</review>< Pics>

We just purchased a class A motorhome from ConejoRV and had an exceptional experience. This was our first motorhome buy so we did as much research on various dealers as we did on the motorhome itself.  We discovered that there are dealers to avoid while most are honest and reliable, however, we found through reputation and personal experience that ConejoRV is not only among the very best in California, but in all the West. We are from Oregon and it was well worth our while to buy from ConejoRV and hope to be a repeat buyer again one day. A few things we learned to look for in a dealer that sells pre-owned motorhomes; buy from a dealer that also sells new coaches from strong brands (this indicates they are reliable and financially well-established), buy from a dealer that has been in business a long time (ConejoRV has been around for over two decades), look for a dealer that has positive reviews from past customers (wherever we find dealer reviews, ConejoRV is always rated very highly), and ask other dealers their opinion (reputable dealers in our state had only positive things to say about ConejoRV).  We also found that practically all the inventory at ConejoRV is in terrific shape and they do a lot of work to make sure the coaches they sell are in great condition and ready to be enjoyed by the buyer.  The warranty they provide on pre-owned coaches also speaks volumes about how they operate and the confidence they have in their process.  We found that ConejoRV also has a strong team culture among its sales and service staff. Everyone we met was helpful and always attentive. And finally, when we bought our coach, we encountered an unexpected mishap and ConejoRV came through for us in spades and made sure we were well taken care of.  We feel very fortunate to have bought our coach  from ConejoRV, which proved itself to be an excellent dealer and overall exceptional business to buy from. Five stars easy.< /Text>

We had a rocky start with one salesman here but they worked quickly to regain our business. Our coach was beautiful and delivered as promised. They took time to walk through every inch with us and explain features. Kirk and Rick were excellent to work with and when we did have a small mechanical problem in our first trip out, it was immediately addresses upon our return. Very happy with our experience and would highly recommend them to anyone searching new or used!< /Review>

We appreciated the way we were treated from the beginning. We had done our research and had some deeper questions. Kirk was professional, patient in answering our questions, very helpful in assisting us to make wise choices, and giving us information we didn't even know we needed. We have already recommended Conejo to others as they gave us the very best deal (we looked at every place between San Francisco and San Diego, plus Iowa and Texas!). We have also made follow-up calls afterwards and gotten timely and satisfactory answers. THANK YOU! for a great experience.<//Text>

He took the time to research what grate was correct for my oven, ordered it, and had it shipped to my home. I had the grate on Aug. 8th. Your company has been very good about the sale, transaction and any problems. Good customer service seems to be a thing of the past, but not with Conejo Wholesale. I also made Kirk aware of a few minor problems with the unit. Kirk said these items are not a problem and would be covered. I just wanted to say my experience with Conejo has so far been a very good one.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Thank you so much for a great experience in buying our home on wheels! The minute we walked on your lot and were NOT followed around, we knew this would be a good place to buy our motor home. When we needed to ask questions, Jim was there. Noel walked us through everything when we picked it up.

We had a few learning curve problems and the staff was there for us.

Thank you so much for being an outstanding facility. Of course, we will recommend you to anyone and everyone!<//Text>

<Text>We purchased our Navion from Conejo in May, after searching many east coast dealers we found by far the best price best deal at Conejo !  - starting with our salesperson ,Ray , we had a great experience with this company- we flew in from N.H. to find everything prepared and in order.  -everyone has had the "dealership" bad experience but this is not the case at Conejo, feel like we met the entire staff who were all friendly ,optimistic, and above all -helpful !  all our calls with questions after the purchase were promptly answered, help was always available when a couple of minor problems popped up. - do not hesitate to fly in from anywhere in the U.S. to buy your RV from these folks !  - totally satisfied customer , thanks guys !< /Text>< Pictures>

Dear Awesome ConejoRV Family,
My wife and I would love to share our experience with this amazing company (ConejoRV). We like to thank all your customers that gave you 100% positive comments. Your past customer reviews are the only reason what made us drive the 200-mile round trip.

Everything you read about (ConejoRV) is absolutely true and more. We were interested in this low mileage 2017 Fleetwood. When we did the initial walk through, we saw minor things would have been nice to get it fixed. When we said we like to buy this unit, this amazing company did their own extreme inspection. One week later sent us an email with a list of things they will fix that we didn’t see during our first visit. Not only did they fix what we didn’t notice, they actually replaced big ticket items such as awnings, TV Etc. We were anxious, while 90% of the RV was getting completed, we wanted to get the RV orientation done. We ended-up getting the most amazing orientation that lasted several hours. We are new to RV life, orientation was conducted in a manner people like us were able to comprehend.

We trusted them so much before getting the rest of the items fixed, we wrote a check immediately for $125,000 and ask them to keep the unit knowing 150% certain they will fix the rest. We wanted to buy our own insurance and the extended warranty from outside. In the end, everything (ConejoRV) recommended (insurance and the extended warranty) ended-up costing us less and better than what we would have paid. When we were about to leave, (ConejoRV) gave us 1-year membership to Thousand Trails. We are going to use that membership to stay for free at Thousand Trails RV sites this year.

We are so glad we didn’t buy a RV from an individual owner or a BIG RV dealership. We would have never received this level of peace of mind or the service. ConejoRV is all about customer retention, on top of what they fixed, they give you a 45-day onsite warranty. We believe the reason why they are the way they are, owner believes in staff working for a salary, not commission. This small team is friendly, honest and care about ConejoRV reputation. We got to know most of the staff, every one of them were absolutely great. They should be in business forever.

We want to express our delight for the amazing customer service provided to us by Ray Clausing of Conejo Wholesale Auto & RV. This last week my wife and I stopped in at their Thousand Oaks location, hoping to determine how best to sell or replace our Ford F250 Super Cab and accompanying 2000 Layton M-2555 Fifth Wheeel. Conejo Wholesale was not in the market to simply purchase, but that did not stop Ray from taking an extraordinary amount of time helping us to determine the value of our equipment. Ray checked our the condition of our truck, providing us with estimates on what we might expect from either a trade-in or perhaps a third party resale. And then he researched the value of our Fifth Wheel, itemizing each and every accessory and enhancement, again providing us wit ha written estimate of what we might expect from a trade-in, or resale.
It goes without saying that the time taken and the detail provided were greatly appreciated and certainly above and beyond what we would have ever expected.</Review>

< Review>
My wife and I purchased a 2008 Forest River Georgetown 374 in May 2016.  We both fully recommend Conejo RV to anyone looking for an RV.  Rick is an honest owner and stands by his word!!  Rick, Jim, Ray, Kirt, Sergio and Nathan bent over backwards to do everything to get us the RV we were looking for, and to make sure our RV was in top condition when driving it off the lot.  Since taking it home we have had no problems.  Rick and the fellas have all lived up to their word in responding quickly to any questions any time we've asked.   In 3 weeks we have put 1,600 miles on our RV without any problems.  Canejo RV is all about customer service, and that something very rare these days.</Review>

<Review>When my wife and I started shopping for a motorhome we ran across quite a few salesman that didn't know a thing of what they were trying to sell us and when they weren't sure of the correct answer, they made one up. We received nothing but lies. Thankfully we ran across you, Rick. You all displayed honesty, courtesy and your willingness to assist in helping find a coach of our liking. Perhaps other dealers should take notice. The coach you sold us is working out wonderfully needless to say. Most importantly the service Conejo Wholesale RV provided, was as promised, one would even say above ones expectations. You stepped up without hesitation to satisfy a customer. You can bet I'll be back to purchase my next RV from you.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Date>

<review>I’ve been around the block, having purchased dozens of vehicles in my life including 4 RVs.  Even though the guys at Conejo were very nice, I was still cautious having never purchased anything from them before.  The RV we selected was a 2002 National Tradewinds Class A Diesel pusher, and since National went out of business a few years ago I felt that I had to be extra cautious; but the price seemed fair, and Rick, Jim and Glen bent over backwards to set me at ease, and help me work out the financing.  I took delivery, and right away went on a week-long road trip to Zion National Park in Utah with my wife and 3 kids.  When the generator began to give us a bit of trouble my first thought was “Aha!  I knew it was too good to be true.”  But sure enough, after the trip Conejo invited me back and quickly repaired the small issue.  Since then we have gone to Portland, Seattle, San Diego, Joshua Tree, Las Vegas, New Mexico, and countless weekend trips to local spots, and I can confidently say that Conejo RV sold me a truly wonderful vehicle.  Not only was it spotless and well maintained, but over and over again the guys at Conejo proved their honesty and integrity with every follow up communication that I had after the deal was done.  In the months after my purchase I checked prices for the same RV online, and the price Conejo gave me was more than just fair –in fact, I am confident that today I could probably sell my RV for more than what I paid for it despite having put over 5,000 new miles on it.  Conejo RV sold me the perfect vehicle for our needs, in great condition, for a great price and stood behind it with great friendship and support, and for this reason I will never purchase an RV anywhere else again.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

We flew from Montana down to LA in the Fall to purchase a class A we saw on your site. It is a 2006 King of The Road Genesis 43 footer. Just wanted you to know that we really couldn't be much happier. The deal was great, the motor home is great, and if we ever wear it out, we'll certainly look you up again!!  I have to tell you though, as first time buyers, we learned a lot! I have gone thru the entire thing, rebuilding the aqua hot, (it froze - my fault), and simply tinkering with EVERY gadget it has and tightening up all the screws, nuts, and bolts, even removing some windows and having the RV Fog Dr. clean them up. It ALL has been a great experience and I'm glad we bought it from you!!<//Text>

<review>I was in the market for a well maintained quality pre-owned diesel pusher. After dealing with the "run of the mill" high pressure cat and mouse games they like to play over at the larger RV chain stores, I fortunately stumbled upon Canejo RV in Thousand Oaks. What a difference! From the moment I stepped onto the dealership property, I felt completely relaxed, unpressured and welcomed. Rick, Ray and Sergio made my RV purchase enjoyable & completely hassle free. I'm quite sure I will be coming back again in the future.< /review>< Pictures>

Last month my husband and I purchased a pre owned 2001 Class A motor home from your dealership and were very impressed by the professionalism of your staff and the overall service we received. When we initially looked at the motor home, we found it to be in excellent condition and very clean. Jim Derengowski showed us around, but we never felt pressured or hurried. Upon making our decision to purchase the RB, Mr Derengowski handled the initial paperwork in a thorough and courteous manner. Another staff member spent more than an hour taking us through the motor home and explaining how things work when we went to pick it up. Instead of a stressful experience, this was a pleasant one and we would not hesitate to recommend your company to our friends. If we ever need a replacement vehicle, we would go no further than Conejo Wholesale Auto and RV<//text>

We were in the market for purchasing a motor home. I was in charge of all the research and type of RV we were going to purchase. We looked around the Los Angeles and Ventura county areas for used, well maintained and fair priced RV's. We saw many RV's, talked to ALL types of salesman and came up with a few to decide on. My husband recently met Rick and Kirk at a camping function and they mentioned that they were affiliated with Conejo RV. My husband suggested we go by and see and glad we did!

We were impressed with the low key, no nonsense, no haggle (because their price's are very competitive right from the start) and overboard on customer service. We are very happy with our purchase and very satisfied with their "We Care" customer service.

Be sure to look around compare prices and customer service when making a purchase and make your last stop at Conejo RV before making your decision. "Happy Camper, Happy Life" :)))))< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>We purchased a well taken care of preowned class A motorhome from Conejo RV Sales. Upon taking delivery I had a few questions. Nate in the service dept was awesome about informing me of anything he could immediately, while researching and responding very quickly to anything he didn't know for sure. He was very thorough and made sure I was given the correct information. We took a couple short weekend trips right away without issue. Unfortunately, one month after delivery it happened...
We had family members fly 1600 miles to road trip from Las Vegas to LA. We had several concerts planned and a space reserved at Dockweiler RV park in Playa Del Rey, CA. Just before departing Vegas I noticed a small puddle of fuel at the back of the coach. I called and spoke with Jim, who had contacted Rick, the owner, and from my description of the issue, decdied it was something to do with the fuel line to the generator. I was advised NOT to run the generator and to bring it in for service the first opportunity possible. We drove to LA without running the generator only to discover we still were leaking fuel. I called Jim again and he didn't hesitate to give me Rick's number directly. The OWNER of the company gladly took my call, on a Sunday evening, his only day off, discussed with me the issue and determined I needed a new fuel pump. He told me to have it towed to the shop when our vacation was over and he'd take care of the problem. Monday morning the fuel pump was ordered and expedited to the shop. Wednesday, when I was able to get towed, they had the bay and mechanics ready and waiting for me as I had to try to make it back to Vegas to get to work that night. They pulled me right in and immediately started fixing my coach. Joseph busted his butt without stopping until the fuel pump and the fuel line to the generator were replaced (Rick was correct in his over the phone assessment). I had mentioned a couple other small issues when I arrived and to my surprise, Rick was out there fixing stuff himself. They had me back on the road in 5 HOURS and didn't charge me a dime!!! From the very first call to the completion of the repair, these guys maintained constant contact (via phone calls and texts) and helped to diffuse an already very stressful situation. I cannot say enough good things about this company and it's entire staff. When we upgrade to a diesel, we will DEFINITELY be returning to Conejo. They have earned themselves a customer for life.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1503412285211, 'text': "Nathan, we were happy to help you as quickly as possible with your fuel leak issue, and I'm so glad you felt we worked efficiently to resolve it.

I felt like they went the extra mile with everyone in my class. I walked away with tons of knowledge and will definitely be going back to renew my certifications. 100000000% recommend.

Called to schedule a class.  The lady that answers the phone was so rude and sarcastic, I would never give them my business.  Each time I asked a question for clarification, she replied, like "uh..yea" in an extremely rude manner. I will be getting training in LA or Fresno.  I believe this business takes advantage of the fact there are few providers of this service, but I for one am willing to travel in lieu of giving my business to people who are rude.< /text>
<Resp>{'time': 1598664770858, 'text': 'Hi Louise, I remember speaking with you on the phone. As I remember we had a very poor connection. You had called to inquire about “child care courses”. Through the poor connection I was trying to ascertain which course you needed to take. We offer courses child development students must take as a requirement for their college degrees; as well as courses for opening a day care facility. These courses are often confused with one another, so my line of questioning wasn’t being rude, rather was trying to ensure that you were directed to the appropriate class; thus not wasting your time, money or energy in the sought after objective. We strive to make sure that each student takes the correct class for their prescribed purpose. The pricing on our courses are designed to be competitive of our neighboring cities/counties. I wish you well in your venture of opening a local child day care facility.'}</Resp></record></dataset><record>

First time using this service and I must tell you, this place rocks!  Every two years, since 2000 I have been renewing my BLS for my career, and this institution is very good.  The instructor is very clear and answers ALL questions.  I will be back in 2 years!< /review>

Second time using this service, and as always it’s A++

The instructors are very informative and the class was engaging, never bored (only when it comes to watching the videos)

Just make sure with your employer that they accept certification before completion of the class</review>

I enrolled literally 30-40 min before the class started and was worth it! The site was very clean! Darren is the best instructor ever he’s very knowledgeable, makes sure you understand and if you don’t he answers your questions as well. The mannequins are up to date working properly! He had snacks and refreshments for us and the site has a restroom as well. He had a good sense of humor to make sure your expirence goes by fast but also get informed in what your suppose to know. I’ll be coming back forsure when it’s time to renew my CPR👌<//Text>

<Review>Only 1 other student when I took the class recently, but between the 3 of us, it was the most-entertaining AND informative 1st Aid/CPR/AED course I'd ever taken.  T.J. is a witty, engaged, pragmatic Instructor, certainly heads and shoulders about the last one I had with a major nationally-recognized enterprise.

This course was by far the best CPR course I’ve ever taken. The instructor was beyond knowledgeable and interactive, thus entertaining. His method of teaching was great.  I learned more in this CPR course in one day than being a Nurse and taugh this several times.  His  teaching method made me able to remember everything in detail and I can actually walk away with confidence knowing what to do in case of an emergency.  I will definitely continue to do my renewals and any other training courses with this company. Thank you Kern CPR——————-L.Garibay<//review>

<Text>TJ was extremely knowledgeable. It is always nice to have someone teaching a class that has been "in the trenches" so to speak. We could tell this guy has saved lives before. The course content was up to date and thorough.  TJ kept the class flowing and made sure the class attendees where comprehending all the subject matter. Thanks for a great class TJ.<//Text>< Pics>

You expressly requested to take ONLY the first aid portion after we had advised you that you would be required to show proof of CPR training. You were very adament that you did not require CPR. So based upon your informed decision we broke the class down just for you. You chose against our advice to take only the first aid. You were even offered a discount to ensure you were in the correct course of training. We complied with your request."}</response>

Just purchased a new mattress and couldn't have been happier with the service from Store Manager Jeremy. He greeted us as we came in, welcomed us with all of our questions, and even remembered all of our top choices from weeks ago when we had originally come in. The store is very clean and the employees are professional and knowledgeable. Will definitely return for future purchases.<//Review>

Michael made ordering a new mattress easy and painless. Helped to make sure I was ordering the right product, and that it would be delivered on time. SEAMLESS! Order confirmations were sent promptly to my inbox, where I was also linked to securely pay online. Easy!!</Review>

Tom was extremely knowledgeable, kind, and helpful. We didn’t feel pressured to buy anything and once we decided on the mattress to get he had great recommendations on box springs, frames, etc.He made the entire process easy for first time bed buyers.</Text>

We went to Matteress Firm in Menlo Park, Ca today looking for an affordable bed. We were pleasantly greated by Michael. When we where looking for beds, Michael did an amazing job helping us find the perfect bed at the perfect price. By the end of the experience, we walked away happy and with a great product. If your looking for friendly service and a fair price, then look no further than Mattress Firm in Menlo Park, Ca. Ask for Michael if he is there. He can hook you up.< /text>

I went into Mattress Firm today just to look at their sales prices and to test out some beds not really expecting to buy a bed. Saif our sales guy was super informative on these products and gave us a good discount, enought for us to pull the trigger on a new bed.  They also picked up our old mattress and hauled it away for free and included free delivery thanks guys. Also the owner gives special donations to foster kids and that's cool too!</Text>

I loved this parish, because they usually have mass for students every Friday to keep their spiritual intact. They have daily masses 730 am for English and 800am for Spanish. The priests here were helpful friendly and super nice , even the Church goers at this church they would go out their ways to help. So just come by for a visit or be a part of this community.</text>

Celibrated a quincinera at this long standing church. It was a beautiful mass held by the pastor "Artur Gruszka". His message and the 2 man choir was insperational. Been here several times over the years and it's been a pleasant experience 👍</text>

<text>Jason, Grayson and some of the employees are absolutely amazing 👏.
Both of these guys are always very cordial and go beyond their regular acceptable practice to offer great customer service. Grayson definitely exhibited ultimate professionalism when on my first visit, I was upset due to the check in procedures. He maintained his cool demeanor and offered to help in any way possible. Keep up the great job.
Needless to say, Jason runs a great staff.</text>< user_name>

I was a little hesitant at first in coming into this location and signing up because of the other reviews. However, that wasn’t the case with me. L.G. took care of me. He was professional and knowledgeable and gave a very welcoming experience. If you want to sign up, I recommend signing up with him!< /Review>

Not a good gym at all. The people aren’t friendly. Run by former hall monitors that aren’t helpful at all. Overpriced and won’t work with members paying for amenities that aren’t open yet (steam room, sauna, basketball courts etc.) not a good environment for personal development<//Review>

<Text>At first I had a terrible experience and there were some problems with the account being connected and not activated properly. The front desk people were very rude about it when I tried going in for my workout when I explained to them that it wasn’t my fault that they didn’t connect the account correctly and never activated my membership they gave me rude responses back. I had a card on file the whole time so it was there fault the card wasn’t being charged. When I came in to fix the situation an amazing assistant manager named Samantha was very understand and polite about the situation and helped us fix the problem. She was extremely respectful which I cannot say is the case for other employees there. She really gives you a whole different experience and is very professional. If anyone wants to sign up I recommend doing it with Samantha she will hook you up the right way!< /Text><user>106050116827934111262< /user>< Pictures>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>Awful experience. Actual fraud.

This gym appeared like the ideal gym to the point my wife and I decided to pay for personal training which is not cheap (obviously). We were offered a month trial to try it out and at the end we decided it wasn't for us. Well, seeking to cancel we were told we weren't allowed too. Come to find out, the person who got us to sign up was the training manager and he was engaging in fraud with another one of the trainers. Only he was fired (not the other one, whose name I wish I'd remember to rat him out too). Months went by due to the pandemic and payments started getting taken out of my bank. When I tried to get my refund I was told by the new manager that since I signed the document I was suppose to commit to the YEAR OF TRAINING. Apparently my wife and I weren't just fraudulently lured to a "month TRIAL", we were lured AND STILL ARE tied down to a YEAR CONTRACT. Over 1,000$ down the drain.

While I do want to make one thing clear, the three trainers who took turns training us were awesome, we have nothing but good things to say about them, our overall experience with the actual company was awful. The fact you can fire a manager for engaging in fraud, luring people like my wife and I to $1,000 dollar services, and then telling me because my signature is on the document that I can't cancel it is literally the definition of fraud. It's a breach of contract if I know any. Once more, the trainers were amazing and i'd recommend them to the world, but my issue is to corporate, or whoever runs the show in this place.

One last thing, I feel awful for the new manager who replaced the slime ball of the previous one because clearly she had to clean up the disgusting and expensive mess the previous manager left. She was amazing as well and I having nothing but great things to say about her as well, clearly her hands were tied because of the snakes up stairs. We were communicating with her for months because her superiors were taking forever to get back and kept telling her that if my signature was on the document I had to pull through with the entire contract. To my knowledge this manager who I'm referring to has now been replaced which probably means if I bring this up to her the same experience will resurface.I have 2 pending training services worth 170$. This place is so awful that I'm considering accounting that money as a sunk cost and never turning back.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

It's the worst, all the equipments they are too old , you can hear it's noise while you working out , and it's an outdoor, no one or nothing on the website that it's outside. And when you decide to cancel it , they charge you the whole fees and they don't refund it to you , even after the first day subscription, it's a scam for members , it's the worst ever .<//Review>

I signed up right before Covid hit and went a couple times until they were forced to close.
I have now lost my job due to Covid and am unable to keep paying. I tried to cancel my membership and you must wait 30 days to cancel. I will still be charged the annual fee along with this months membership fee as well. I attempted to ask for an exception due to the circumstances and they would not help me. The gym is great, but not impressed on their customer service. They care more about getting their money than helping their members who need the money for food instead. I will no longer be returning to this gym when I am working again.< /text>

<text>I love the gym but the child care is just a total warehouse for the kids. The TV is constantly going and I've asked many times for the TV to be turned off so the kids won't sit there for 60 or 90 minutes and do nothing. I've talked with many people, including management. The issue never changes. My child is bored and sits and watches TV the whole time I work out. When my (hard sell) contract with a personal trainer runs out in three months, I'm done with this gym. It's a shame because personally like the gym and the staff at the gym. As a single mom, I can't see having my daughter sit in front of a TV while I'm getting healthy. It feels wrong, and the childcare could do better, but TV is obviously the best baby-sitter, right?</text>< userid>

<Review>I was pressured into signing up for personal training and lied to about the price. I went to join the gym for $20, I've been there 2 months and have paid $100's on top of a $99 enrollment fee I paid 2 months ago a annual fee just came out that I was unaware of. They won't give me a higher ups contact info and now are avoiding my calls. I will never joing another gym due to this! I see by reading the comments I'm not the only person this has happened to!
Now if who ever responds to these reviews, can get me some contact info I'd appreciate it.

3 years ago my son had a membership there and now we get a collection co. calling us stating that we owe $400 BECAUSE WE DIDN'T CANCEL OUR MEMBERSHIP properly. REALLY!? No letters in the mail, no phone calls and 3 years later a collection co.?! If this is real, DO not join this gym, they obviously won't let you out of a contract even if you cancel! They are calling my son who was a minor at the time of membership.... EOS is this real??? If this is a SCAM from the collection agency, then EOS should call me immediately. BEWARE. I'll update once I hear from EOS.< /Review>

I have to admit, a friend of mine recommended this place to me a week ago and although I was skeptical at first, I have been pleasantly surprised with my experiences so far.

The staff is always friendly, and even when I signed up for a membership here I was not pressured to add anything to it.  I came in for the simple 9.99 membership, I told them that, and I left with the simple 9.99 membership. Pure and simple.

I’ve seen a lot of complaints about the “roidos” intimidating people off machines or hogging them, but I personally have not had this issue.  I don’t think I’m a very intimidating guy (idk maybe I am), but anytime I ask the status of a machine currently in use, I always get a pleasant response from the patron using it.

24 hour gyms are incredibly hard to find, especially at this price.  This was a huge sell point for me as my work schedule and school schedule changes consistently and I will NEVER have a set time for the gym.  Being currently on graveyard and being able to go the gym at 10 at night or 2 in the morning is huge for me, and I’m glad they have this option.

There are so many amenities here that I am blown away by the pricing.  Tanning, classes, sauna, cross-fit and powerlifting sections, etc. is a lot for only 9.99 a month.

All ‘n all, I have yet to have a bad experience here.  Yes, the crowds are annoying at times, but the 24 hour aspect greatly alleviates that burden for people like myself.  I am excited to go here for years to come and watch this gym grow even more!<//review>

I signed up here and was a member for about 4 months, it was a pretty straightforward gym. Nice staff members, pretty easy going atmosphere but sometimes it can get crowded. The weight section is kind of in a weird shape but there is everything you need to build muscle. Plus, you can do some kickboxing with the bags in the gymnasium or play some basketball. Decent place, I started with the free trial and ended up with a membership, I had a good experience at this gym. Too bad I moved.< /Text>

Do not trust these people with your credit card information.  1st, you get a personal trainer you meet with then learn you cannot use that person and they give you someone else who is often unavailable. When it comes to cancelling your membership.  The run around is too complex to go deep into here.  THEY MAKE IT VERY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CANCEL AND WILL KEEP CHARGING YOUR CREDIT CARD!  Even when put in writing, and with calls.    It is not the gym but an underhanded, snake like financial services company the gym happily uses that has your Credit Card information.   Then, they want NEW credit Card information from you - TO CANCEL!   DO NOT TRUST EOS GYM.<//text><rate>1<//rate><pics>None<//pics>< name>

The staff at EOS have been really friendly and I have made a couple of really good friends during my time there. Even though this gym is a larger one, the trainers and staff make you feel like you're right at home. The facilities overall are well taken care of. I see staff every time I'am there keeping the place clean and well stocked. I rarely see any equipment out of service and since I have be going to the Murrieta location I have actually see plenty of upgrades and renovation. I have yet to take a class there but everyone leaving seems to have a smile on they're faces. Overall, this has become my favorite gym to work out at. Great Job EOS :) I highly recommend giving EOS Fitness a try. You wont be disappointed!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Text>Perfect location, friendly staff, neat facility with a cardio cinema and steam room! Parking is plenty around the building.

I signed up in October of 2019 since I moved to Murrieta and have since tried multiple group classes including Barr, Bodypump, pilates, yoga and more along with PT with Doulla. Variety of group classes keeps me engaged and having fun while exercising! As for PT, it was my first experience training with a trainer and I can't say enough good things about my trainer Doulla - she went through a thorough introductory session to identify the areas I needed to focus on and the core of my challenge, which is the hip tendonitis and customized a workout routine that works perfect for a weighlift beginner like myself, while reducing further injury. With her, I consider myself in great hands to get fitter and overcome injuries!

Also, I am grategul to Yusef for a great complementary welcome workout - the session was so much more than what I expected and it was what prompted me to sign up for the PT right away.

Overall, I love the gym. The only thing I hope for is maybe a bigger and cleaner restroom. The locker room is rather small and the showers are limited-only 3 for such a huge gym. Oh well, considering the services they provide and its price, it's a small problem that wouldn't deter me from continuing to enjoy this gym. I'd avoid the hours between 5 to 8 pm on weekdays if wants to avoid the crowds.< /Text><user_id>106579711042684843315<//user_id>< time>

Great facility and equipment. The gym is always clean and the people who use it take care of the gym.  Every maintenance​ issue I have reported is fixed by my next visit, and I have never run into an issue where it is too crowded.

They also recently hired a new trainer, Matt, who is awesome to work with and really listens to what you have to say.  I used to work at 24 hour fitness for 5 years so I'm not looking for a trainer, but if I wanted one, he would be the guy I would go to.< /Review>

Decent place to work out at. As with most corporate gym chains, it is pretty busy. It's not bad if you come early in the morning or late at night. They have many facilities there besides the standard stuff; basketball court, monkey bars, cross fit area with tires and battle ropes, a yoga studio, and they have a steam room to relax your muscles! They staff is super friendly and helpful. If you have an issue they always do their best to help.<//text>

<Review>This Gym is great! They have everything you could need from machines to free weights and deadlier pads! The great thing is thst there is so much equipment even if it is busy I can always find something to do. It is a great price too! If you want classes they can set you up or if you just want to do your own thing you can do that as well! And it was only $5 to upgrade so I can bring someone with me whenever I want!</Review>< resp>

I have never witnessed such TERRIBLE customer service in all of my years on this planet.  The employees walk around as if they are the kings and queens of the universe and don't even acknowledge you when passing by.  Instead, they look through you as if you aren't even there.  Also, a friend of mine was attempting to add a service to their account so he asked an employee how to go about doing so.  Long story short, my friend got directed to an 800 number for customer service, who then told him that the gym had to add the service, then had to go through 3 more people to finally get an answer.  Talk about lack of training or lack of caring, or both.  I have been a member for 6 months simply because it is in a convenient location for me but I am cancelling ASAP!  They do have some decent equipment but that can be found at ANY gym.  All in all I am disappointed that I gave this place my hard earned money as they did absolutely nothing to earn it.  If you like to be treated like a human being by employees of an establishment, I strongly suggest staying away from here.</review>

My daughter went back today and talked to the general manager (Cutter) who was extremely helpful and bent over backward to get us settled. In addition he said the company wants to the canceling process to be very easy for the customer. If you ever have issues figuring out how to cancel, just see the manager :).

Worst gym ever! Do not join this gym. The men's bathroom is always absolutely digusting, all the cardiovascular equipment is broken, there is not enough free weights or flat benches, there is only one decline sit up bench, there is no dress code so everyone is working out in their underwear.

< Review>
Love this Gym, been coming for a couple years. My son Especially loves the child care. Tried out LA Fitness and didn’t last 2 weeks, they weren’t attentive to my son. Left him crying ( he was new) but the ladies here are so much better with him, very attentive and you can tell they love spending time with little ones!
The gym gets busy you just need to time it correctly.
The one thing I HATE is that the Spin Room is off limits when there aren’t any classes going! Yes they have some Cycle bikes out of the room but those fill up quickly and they aren’t as good as the Keiser bikes in the room!!! they need to UPGRADE TO PELOTONS!
And personal training is Great!<//Review>

This place is always packed. They have sold too many memberships for building that cannot hold that many people. I've never seen 3 people to machine on a non peak hour in the whole gym unless you've ventuted on a navy ship where the gym is 1/6 the size up their gym and there's 3200 people to accommodate<//text>

f I could give this gym negative starts , I would. Originally I thought this would be a great club to join since the price was right the amenities were decent and the staff seemed okay. That perception changed quickly.

When I first went to sign up , I figured it was going to be an easy process. However ,out took over an hour and a half and lots of upselling before I could finally just sign up. The thing that they would continue upsell was the personal fitness. I must've said "No" at least 4 or 5 times to it before I finally agreed based on the condition that it would be $19 and I could cancel if I didn't like it.  Also, because after being seated and talking to them for over 30 minutes  and me constantly declining personal fitness , I felt that they would not let me leave until I agreed.

The best day was supposed to be the start of my personal fitness and I couldn't go because I got extremely sick. I called to cancel my session and they didn't say anything in regards to it.

Today. I called and decide to cancel my personal fitness because I was not able to attebd due to me being sick and Jared Burton told me that I was only allowed to cancel within the initial 5 days. Keep in mind this was never told to me in person while I was signing up. Not once. When I asked him where this was mentioned he said it was in the signed documents that were emailed to me. Keep in mind they never once showed me the documents on the computer they were signing me up on.

It was then I let Jared know that I will just cancel all payments from my bank and he retorted by threatening me with collections. It was then I asked to cancel my trial membership because I would never want to step into a gym were their members are treated like this and he stated that since I had a personal fitness agreement for 6 months, I would not be able to cancel my gym membership either.

To sum it up. This is by far the most unprofessional gym I have ever signed up for and Jared being a manager is one of the most unprofessional people I have ever come into contact with. DO NOT JOIN.< /Review>

This EOS is by far the worst in the Temecula valley area. The place is dirty and always smells bad. The locker rooms are even worse than the floor. I hate coming to this location and to be honest I would drive far out of my way to go to one of the other locations which are far nicer. In fact the only reason I come to this particular location anymore is because this is the only one to my knowledge which has tanning beds in the Temecula valley. I refuse to workout here, and hate that I come here to tan. Can we clean this place up, please? Gives the whole franchise a bad name<//review>

This gym is a rip off. The membership is sold to you as a low cost, no contract membership. You are only advised that you must give 30 day notice to cancel, understandable. They sell you on a personal trainer contract. No problem until you decide to cancel. Even after the personal training contract is more than ended, it will require an act of Congress to cancel and a lot of expended energy and frustration. Now just to cancel your gym membership you will have to pay a cancellation fee even if you are not in a contract and paid timely always for years. It is a shame what lengths this company will go to in order to make money illegitimately from it's members! Don't sign up with EOS Fitness. After speaking with Cutter, the general manager, I've increased my rating. He is very professional and makes every effort to accommodate members. Unfortunately, EOS needs to contract with a more knowledgeable billing company.</text>

I never saw the prior reviews but I'm in agreement this is the "worst gym" I've ever entered. My first day was today and I found equipment that wasn't working. I mentioned it to the trainer with the last name Alonso and he shrugged his shoulders and told me he was "a trainer" he couldn't do anything. Instead as a professional employee calling someone or informing me who I could let know.  Unbelievable he could represent EOS in this manner. He didn't figure out how it looks to have inadequate equipment to potential customers and those that pay to use the facility. I immediately cancelled my membership and went to CRUNCH a few miles away in Winchester. There has to be a reason the reviews are bad. Do yourself a favor and avoid this gym. They give you a hour free session with your membership and the trainers are like used car sales people looking at you as a dollar sign for future training session income. This behavior exemplifies the bad reviews posted. The bad customer service I experienced I'm sure is costing them with members walking away as reflected from the reviews I've read.  Its the start of the new year and we all should be able to work out at a gym that has our best interest. Not one that gives a disconnect impression to its members. READ THE PAST REVIEWS and find a trustworthy family gym. I highly suggest you avoid membership at this gym based on what I saw and experienced and the reviews posted.<//review>

Well, don't let them scam you like they scammed me. I told them I was only going to be here in Murrieta for two weeks. Both the lady Vivianna and the Manager Michelle were both there and privy to this information. I asked them for a 7 day free pass, as I was with my friend, who is a member. They playfully refused and said something about certain qualifications. Vivianna assured me they would only charge me one dollar for the two weeks.. I asked to give her one dollar cash and she refused...Should have been more suspicious. When I called to cancel,which goes through a call center, they told me they were still going to charge me 24.99 for one month. I told them I would be contacting the BBB, as well as my financial institution to let them know about the disingenuine way in which they handled the situation, and whether or not it constituted fraud. EOS never printed any documents for me, or allowed me to read, "the fine print." Also, the call center said, I needed to give a 30 day written notice of cancellation, so I asked them, since i ewwas only in the states for two weeks, should I have sent my cancellation in before I even signed up? Makes no sense. When someone wants to cancel, they should be allowed to cancel. I was in a hurry and just wanted to go and lift weights with my buddy and I should have been more suspicious. Don't get scammed the same way I did</review>

<Review>WARNING: BEWARE OF THIS GYM.
I have been trying for one month to get a refund for being over-charged for my annual membership.
Incompetence at every level. Lie after lie. They simply don't care about their members.
All of this after having been a member for 9 years. Hopefully the BBB will help me out, because I am not finished with these morons.

Anyone reading this now looking for a gym should seriously look elsewhere.</Review>< rate>

EOS is a scam, stay away from there. They are zero rating for me and my family. I am very disappointed with this gym. The staff are dishonest and once they have you in a contract they no longer have the integrity and customer service they are faking during initial assestment. The worst is paying for a personal trainer and it takes 2-3 weeks to get a response. My trainer Chris, I thought pretty good in the beginning, but after few months he is no different with the rest of the staff. Pretty much I payed the whole contract but getting a session and follow up, good luck! Injured my knees with a personal trainer. Seriously disappointed and upset.< /Review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>It's a good place for barebones muscle growth, I've seen the big improvements in my shoulders and legs. The real problem for me is the atmosphere. The music is loud vapid hot air (especially this one racist song about a guy who wants to bone Japanese women but can't because he keeps calling them Jackie Chan, who is Chinese???) The movies playing in the aerobics room are usually lame, with really only one or two movies I was able to sit through without walking out of boredom. There is a quieter more private space at the back of the building where my wife likes to do her ab exercises, but the Wi-Fi doesn't reach back there so you can't listen to music or watch Youtube to drown out the music. Finally, the televisions only plays static, Fox News, or football. Needs a little more variety.
Again, if you bring your own headphones and just want to get bigger it's worth the money, but without headphones this place is torture.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Always crowded. One time i went straight from work and literally every machine in the place was taken except for a few cardio machines upstairs. I had to leave and come back 2 hrs later and it was still decently crowded.</Review>

Love this place. They have a movie room, child care with plenty activities, spin room, b-ball court and dance/cardio classes like Zumba! And the locker/bathroom is equip with steam room and showers. Whats also great about this place is they have small accessories available at cheap prices such as beverages shakes and sweat towels just in case you forget your own. I just wish they had a facility by me up here in Hemet!<//Text>

The guy that signed me up, literally didnt tell me there was a charge to lock in my rate for a year. I thought signing up was 20 bucks for sign up plus 25 for the 1st month... well they added an extra 40 dollar charge that was explained to me. So to my surprise 12 days after signing up and paying 20 for signing up I was charged another 65 dollars. When I was expecting to be charged just another 25 dollars. The next month they pulled the normal 25 dollars. But the month after they pulled 50 dollars. Next month was normal 25 and then this month again another 50 dollar charge. When I call to tell them I'm being overcharged, I'm told that there is a 25 dollar late fee if your payment doesnt pull out on the scheduled date. Which I was never explained when I signed up. I dont have an issue with fees if you explain them and they are legitimate fees. Charging a 25 dollar late fee on a 25 dollar membership is ridiculous. And the fact that when i called they offered 0 help and couldnt cancel my account at her level. I find it convenient that you can double charge me my monthly but to cancel my account I have to call a completely seperate department. I'll be going back to 24 hour fitness and signing back up with them. At least they dont lie to you and steal your money. Yeah it's more expensive but I dont have to deal with snakes who lie about what comes with your membership and doesnt explain the fees associated with an account and signing up. I wish I could give 0 stars on this review.</review>< response>

<text>I’m into my 2nd week of personal training and I’m absolutely blown away with what I’ve learned so far! After overcoming some terrible health complications, I returned to EOS to get back in shape. After a few months of trying on my own, I met Joey Amieva and immediately signed up for personal training with him. He designed an amazing plan catered to my goals, nor ever hesitates to answer any questions that I have. Joey’s genuinely passionate about fitness and his dedication to his clients more thab shows... like showing up on crutches to a training session and giving the hardest quad workout!
While the gym world can be overwhelming to get into, its a relief to have met such a knowledgeable and dedicated trainer like Joey!<//text><name>alyssa mcroberts</name></record></dataset><record>

Worst gym I have ever been to.... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.... all they did was scam me out of months worth of payments and extra charges.. and when I tried to cancel my membership with them, they took months to take care of it after I repeatedly try canceling numerous times, costing me several more months of gym cost that I was never attending in the first place... and I was promised to have it fix and waiver all the extra fees for hassle and etc, which were all lies...and the Membership Services Center is even worse... I have phone records and other proof showing I've been doing it for months and they are falsifying everything to try and cover their asses... ridiculous... SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE PEOPLE...<//Text>

If you're looking to cancel good luck. They will send you over to ABC financial who is their "billing" department and want you to pay 1 last month. If you don't pay 1 last month they will threaten to not guarantee your cancellation and EOS will send you to collections. ABC says they can only handle some things and EOS has to handle others things. Seems like a financial company in Arkansas shouldn't be handling customer service for a gym in Murrieta California. When EOS signs you up and says you can cancel at any time at no cost, believe that to be a lie. EOS/ABC will show up on your bank statement which tells me both parties are held responsibly for any customer service issues. You could very well be paying for a membership you don't use or don't want to use so beware......< /review>

Just moved to Temecula California from  Arizona. Excited about the change , wanting different results. I decided to venture out and join EOS. My daughter & I joined in December 2017. I had explained when I joined I have ADD and might need some extra instruction because I learn and take instruction in a different way. I jumped on board and got a personal trainer. All went well for a couple of months. Then comes the snide remarks and side jabs making me feel less then . Another month of this goes by and finally had it. Walked out of my session in tears. Was embarrassed and humiliated .I contact EOS in Temecula spoke to management who wasn’t helpful to my needs. Then went to another location further away from my house in Murrieta. Kenji was so helpful and tried to help me as much as possible Kudos to you kenji!!! But it was hard for to make this drive 3xs weekly. I asked if there was anyway I could cancel my personal training but keep my reg monthly fee of 7.97. I was told no. I’ve called member services who said I need a letter from my primary care provider saying I have a learning disability which caused me to want to leave EOS. I was in preparations of doing so. BAM. I woke up this morning to EOS pulling $410.00 out of my account. I heard EOS was bad place to join but I did anyways. So my bad in trusting in this company. You can bet I won’t be coming back . Between the corporate level and local gym I’m very Unsatisfied and how they treat people with disabilities of any kind. Thanks for welcoming this person to California EOS👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽< /text>

I hate eos fitness .I canceled on the 15th and then they charge me on the 25th of the next month for $10 stating that all you need 30 days to let us know like you guys are renting a house it’s just a membership you guys suck ABC financial sucks they don’t give you any money back . They said all you have to do is pay the $10 and then when you get a month free like I don’t want to month free I’m moving you idiot and then they still charge you the $10 I’m so over EOS<//review>

<Text>total scam. call the billing dept(call center) and talk to them and you'll see what i'm talking about. They don't even try to make things right after over charging. It's obvious this is how they operate.
When I went to cancel they wanted to charge my accounts the yearly maintenance fee for now->next year. Why would I pay a service fee for gym upkeep when I don't go to that gym?

almost everyone I know has had a billing issue with this place and has cancelled thier account.

The only one who I actually received good customer service from and helped me with my billing issue was eryn.</Review>

<Review>Beware of them tricking you with their "promotions." The gym is currently offering a basic membership for 1 dollar down and 9.99 a month. But they will charge you a 39.99 dollar fee to lock in your rate. They don't tell you this in the advertisement and they do not tell you until you are about to sign the paper. This is a blatant lie and false advertising to potential clients. It is NOT $1down/$9.99permonth. It is either $41down/$9.99permonth or $1down/$14per month. This is a straight up lie to trap you in a contract and if you want to cancel its 100 bucks in fees. FIND ANOTHER GYM!

The guy also had this dumb look on his face like he didn't know how to do math. The pricing is falsly advertised.<//Review>< Response>
{'time': 1529974019342, 'text': "Joseph, thank you for your review a while back regarding our membership options.  I appreciate you highlighting our price points for each membership. Most facilities that are a low price, high value model do offer as part of their membership an annual rate guarantee.  It not only locks in your membership rate but also goes back into the club for any needed repairs and updates.  I apologize that that may have taken you by surprise.  Thank you for your time with us! If you're still in the area, I would be honored to invite you into our new Temecula Parkway facility a few miles from our Murrieta facility.   If there is anything that you need then please let me know.\n\nKeith Elliott\nMember Experience Director\nkelliott@eosfitness.com"}<//Response>

<user_name>333GCM</user_name><text>I'm shocked at most of the negative reviews on this gym. I've been a member since the Gold's/EOS change over and I love it. I used to be a member of 24hr in Temecula and I must say that equipment breaks! I've been members of both (my wife is still at 24hr) and there are times when items are broken, its part of life. Usually at both gyms, the equipment is fixed in a day or so (no biggie). As for the rude staff, I will say that when I first signed up, there was one girl at the front desk that seemed to be bothered by anyone that came in the door, thankfully she's gone. but every morning I go in (usually around 5am), I'm always greeted by Lance (who knows my name) and I always get a "have a great workout" on my way in. When leaving, I always get the "have a great day!" This is a fairly small gym in comparison to the 24hr in Temecula and yes, its gets busy (I used to go at night), but if you can change your routine slightly, problem solved. Every morning there is free equipment to use, the staff is helpful and happy to answer questions. There is one guy that seems to think he's God's gift, but you know what... not everyone you come across in life is pleasant, so I know if I want to pay for a trainer, it AIN'T gonna be him! LOL. On the fee side, I had them double bill me once due to a change over in their system. Called customer service and problem solved. Instead of billing me for the following month, they applied the double payment to the next month, OH, they also offered me a refund of the extra billing too?< /text>< resp>

< review>
I'm very shock reading some of these reviews,  our family loves going to EOS Murrieta. All of us have been going since January 2016, we have never seen any rude staff act unprofessional.  They have always been very nice from the day we started,  love Jordan always very pleasant and Cutter is the guy to go to when things aren't working or need attention they always ask how things are going never had an issue with none of them. One thing that I would love to put out there is, thanking my Trainer Sean Shannon who was assigned to me when I started in January. He is an amazing trainer and a great motivator, never seen a trainer who goes above and beyond for his clients. Sean actually cares about his clients, and checks on you when your sick or injured to see how your feeling. Now this is a trainer who really loves what he is doing and very knowledgeable on what he is doing, when it comes to your diet and training. When I started training in January 2016 with Sean, because of his motivation, diet and training never giving up on me I have lost over 45lbs and I feel amazing. Being a mom and turning 50 years old, after having 3 kids I feel good and more confident in myself.  I wanted to say thank you Sean for everything, you are an awesome trainer. Thank you EOS you have made me believe in a gym again, also thank you to Sean's wife Edele she is amazing. Thank youI absolutely love EOS Murrieta, I started working out in January 2016. My trainer Sean goes above and beyond, when taking care of his clients. He is very considered and motivating when it comes to your diet and training, he checks on u when your unable to make it to the gym due to an injury or illness. Thanks to his motivation, diet and training I have lost over 45lbs since January 2016. And I wanted to thank him for never giving up on me, Sean you are an amazing trainer ..
Now from reading several reviews on Facebook and Google, and don't get me wrong everybody is entitled to their own opinion. But come on people seriously, let me just throw it out there since some of these things the staff can't. So I will speak for them...
*1 this is a gym where u go to workout at, relax or let of some steam or stress before or after work. It's not a dating neither a pick up place or for people to hog equipment while they are talking on the phone. It's called common courtesy and respect for others.
*2 once again this is a gym with members going in and out 24/7 best rates than everywhere else and people still complain about the smallest things. It's impossible to maintain a gym  clean 24/7, I have yet to see any gym that way so it's understandable.. Times that we have been going, there is always a cleaning crew in the bathrooms or vacuuming the gym and most times it's so crowded so they do the best they can. If the cleaning crew would interrupt your training cause there is some trash, you people would complain about that too. There is no win, win in all this..
*3 If you see trash laying around by equipment or empty water bottles guess what people, that is your trash you left there cause you guys where to lazy to put it in the trash.This is a gym not your personal maid service to pick up after you, your the ones who brought it in and you should be responsible for throwing your own trash away in the trash cans provide for you..
*4 There are always going to be issues no matter where you go, you can't please everyone. And being prior members of 24hr fitness, don't even get me started.
Our family loves coming to EOS Murrieta and we are so happy that we made the change, hands down to all of you. Specially my trainer Sean Shannon thank you.< /review>

This gym has the convenience of being open 24/7, and have the necessary equipment to train properly, but the gym trainers are not very reliable, and had me waiting for them for 15 minutes, and it's overcrowded most of the time, so I suggest going early morning, or midday.<//review>

<Review>My wife is a member here and she signed up with a personal trainer.now she is pregnant and is trying to cancel the personal trainer and the gym membership.And they told her to bring proof of her pregnancy from a doctor,and she will be able to cancel.Like they cant tell she is pregnant.So she brings in the ultrasound and doctors note to show them proof.Then they tell her she has to call this numbers and talk to this person,and they cant cancel her membership there at the gym.She called the number they gave her and they just gave her the run around and told her she needs to go back to the gym.So she goes back and now they tell her,that they have plenty of pregnant women going to the gym and have personal trainers,so she needs to bring a doctors note stating that she can not do physical activity, or else she can not cancel her membership and she has to keep paying.Is anyone else having similar issues with this gym bullying their members and not cancelling the contracts when you do not want to be apart of the gym anymore.< /Review><rate>1</rate><time>1489682967587</time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

<text>Many times members do multiple exercises, for example, using the rowing machine and dumbbells at the same time,  with two to three people. In other words they hog equipment while cycling through machines while waiting and after asking how many sets are left. This is rude and their seems to be no management of this. We all pay for service and customer service should be driven and ethics enforced.<//text>< pics>

This place is top notch. It’s rare to find a place you can trust with you car but the guys at Advanced Automotive are as honest as they come. And as a woman that doesn’t know a great deal about cars, it’s so nice to have people you can rely on for good service with integrity. The owner Jeff is a really great person who truly cares about his customers. His tech Justin helped me out with a tire change and I was in and out in 5 minutes. Super friendly and professional. Highly recommend!!!</text>

Highly recommend this auto shop. My power steering went out in my Honda Civic so I decided to take it to the Honda dealership in San Juan Capistrano to have it looked at. They told me that the steering gearbox/torque sensor would need to be replaced, quoting me at close to $3,000. I took my car to Advanced Auto service for a second look, and within a day they told me that just a wire would need to be replaced and that I would only be charged for the $135 inspection. Justin was honest and professional. I will be returning to this business for future services.</Review>

<Review>We have a 1999 Lexus lx470 with close to 300,000 miles on it.  She overheated the other night heading up the hill and we thought maybe this was her last breath. I had it towed to Advanced & Justin checked it out.  A few hours later and for less than $130 she's back on the road and we couldn't be happier. Thank you for always doing great work at a fair price in a timely manner, Justin.<//Review><response>{'time': 1594302512024, 'text': "You're very welcome, Ken!

Great experience. I've stopped into several of the shops in town and this may be the most efficient and honest place. The technician on duty was extremely knowledgeable and helpful! He was very honest and thorough. Also, the gentleman working the office was friendly, quick and helpful as well. They even send you a free quick health report on your vehicle.

<GmapID>0x80dcf4590db05c45:0x6fb9a9a7610c26a< /GmapID><Text>Been a customer of Advanced Auto since the ScottyD/Sergio days. Scotty D has been our mechanic for over 10 years and has done an excellent job keeping our family fleet running. I have follow Scott to different shops because he's that good. (Scotty D). Scotts the kind of mechanic who fits in the Mom driving a van with kids with flat tire, helps your kid fill the tires on their bikes, makes sure to offer exclusive discounts to our military. He's an excellent mechanic and even a better person.
About a month ago I was in Advanced Auto having some work done. Quite day, work getting completed as promised by Scotty D. Than an Owner Jeff shows starts yelling at Scott and the front office people. Owner Jeff was totally unhinged.
I got to watch this owner Jeff of Advance Auto fire my favorite mechanic for over a decade, while I was in the shop. One of the most unprofessional things I have ever seen an owner do. Cons of Shop, Owner Jeff is Nasty, owners don't appreciate local customers, new mechanics lack experience, quality dropped, newest charge diagnostic fees, and cheap replacement parts (O'Reillys & Autozone), not allowed to bring in your own parts. The shop is basically trying to charge DEALER prices, without the service, expertise, and products to justify they prices.
They are sticking it to people of South OC. My Advice stay far away from shop and find Scotty D if you need work done.< /Text>< Rate>

Friendly, fast, honest, and informative. Car problems are never a good experience, but Advanced made me feel taken care of, and made the experience as good as it could possibly be. Plus, everything got financed, so the already low cost was painless! It's comforting to know I have a neighborhood auto shop I can trust.< /Text>

These guys were great - super friendly and professional. Encountered a nail in my tire while driving on the 5, and unexpectedly had to exit in an area I was unfamiliar with; by random coincidence, saw their sign while looking for a service station. They expedited my repair and I was off in 30 minutes. Thank you for the assistance - highly recommend!</text>

I'm glad I towed my car here; not only did they do a great job finding and fixing the problem fast, but they also sent me a link showing my car getting fixed and listing all the inspections it received including what needs urgent repairs and what can wait. And all at a fair price, way better than the dealership. I'm definitely bringing my Mini here for more services. = )))< /text>

We just moved to the area and needed a good local shop to take care of our vehicles. I found this shop on Yelp with high reviews so I decided to give them a try. I brought in our 2014 Kia Optima for a 60K service, not knowing what it needed. They sent me a text with a link to a completed multi-point inspection showing me what the car needed as well as what it didn't need. That was important for me to know they were trustworthy and not going to sell me things the car didn't need. The car was ready on time and at a very reasonable price. I plan on bringing our other cars here for service when they need it.< /Text>

Disclaimer: I've known Jeff Harris (Owner of Advanced Automotive) for quite some time now.  He is one of the most trustworthy, honest, high integrity person I've ever met so naturally when he bought Advanced Automative several years ago I figured I'd give it a try.  My experience was great.  No complaints.

Then latter on when I needed to get a car repair I went there one day late in the afternoon and they were a little busy so I decided to go somewhere else bc it was somewhat urgent.  Long story short It's been probably about 2 years since I've been.

Disclaimer #2: I'm not good with cars at all!  I know nothing about them and could very easily get taken advantage of.  For that reason (and the fact that I'm lazy and probably not as responsible as I should be :)) I had a LOT of deferred maintenance with my truck.  But it wasn't until I was going down a hill with my son and had to stop at a red light and wasn't sure if I would be able to that I decided the situation was URGENT and I needed to take my vehicle in or I would be putting myself and family in danger each time we went anywhere.

However in the back of my mind I thought oh man I'm going to be taken advantage of bc I have no idea what I'm doing.  Then I remembered Jeff's shop and thought well since I know Jeff to be such a stand up guy I imagine his shop is ran by stand up people and he's taught them how he wants things done.

Having that been said I still figured they would tell me EVERYTHING needed to be done and it was ALL urgent!  And even though they probably could have done that justifiable and been pretty accurate I just didn't like that I wouldn't know.

But I had no choice to take it in to at least get the breaks fixed so I went for it.  They got be in quickly.  I called ahead of time and Chrissy was very nice as well as when I showed up.

Justin (great name) took at look at my vehicle, and I received a report stating everything that was fine with my car, somethings that they recommended and then a couple of things that were urgent.

The ONLY things that they said were urgent was the breaks, which I knew was true.  To my huge surprise the other things they told me weren't an emergency but they recommended them but at no time did I feel like I was being manipulated or taken advantage of.  But felt like they were looking after me and just giving the pure facts.  There were a couple of items I had done recently and none of them came up on the recommended list.  A couple of the items that came up I asked about and I never felt like I was being high pressure sold but just educated.  It felt like I had someone who was just there to give me the information and help me understand instead of take advantage of my ignorance.

I looked up a coupe of the recommended items on the list and sure enough each time the cost I found online was always higher than what they quoted me.

Since I knew I could trust them I decided to just move forward with all of the recommended items and I feel like I have a new truck and my family is safe.  And my wife is proud of me for being a man and getting the truck fixed! :) even though I did a lot of work.  They got me my vehicle back that same day and even stayed a little late until I came to pick it up.

I would HIGHLY recommend Advanced Automative to anyone who is looking for a shop they can rely on with trustworthy good people who are working behind the desk, under the hood and behind the scene to make sure your vehicle and family are taken care of.<//Review>

Advanced auto goes above and beyond what any other shop I've been to has done. I had an issue with a blown shock and they actually took me under the car to show me the problem and let me know how long I have to save up for the recommended service.</review>

<Review>Bad Service, does not honor warranty.  Incorrectly installed front brakes. Could have killed me. Would not pay for emergency repair at another shop. Run away from these guys.  Told me to take them to court. I am filing with small claims now!<//Review>< username>

I did explain to you on the phone that I run the front office by myself and do not have the available time to give you an exact quote over the phone. I did tell you that an average oil change is between $50 and $70. You informed me that your 2015 Subaru takes full synthetic oil and I advised you that the price would be around $70. I also offered you an appointment today. Thank you for calling. Crissy'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Best doughnuts in town! I recently moved to Bakersfield, CA and was told about this place. They were not kidding. Fresh baked throughout the day, great service, and best of all... they're open 24 hours a day! A must have if you're in town and enjoy a good doughnut 😀<//Text>

The Ming Ave location is locally owned and operated by a dedicated family that values service and quality. They serve up a few unique offerings, like the jalapeño ham & cheese croissant, that make it worth seeking out the storefront. Its situated right off the highway, so it's a pretty convenient stop too!< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

Some of the best donuts in town. Great prices for a dozen and very friendly. These are the donuts that I was looking for. I'm definitely going to be coming back again. I think I found a new go to.<//Text>

I arrived around 9 AM on a Saturday morning and there was only one other customer in the donut shop, so it wasn’t very busy and I was in and out with ease.  It is very small, with not many options. The donut shop was clean and the selections were neatly displayed. Their staff is friendly, and their helpful nature set a welcoming precedence. Their prices are reasonable; I chose six donuts, totaling six dollars and change.<//Review>

They have fresh donuts they make in the morning.  The maple bars are my favorite.  The staff is friendly and they accept cash or credit cards.  They also have a croissant with various fillings such as cheese and ham want to say.  They get you in and out of there very quickly. Will go back again</Review>

<Text>While visiting Bakersfield this weekend, we HAD to visit an old favorite sweet store...Fosters Donuts, Ming Ave @ Frwy 99!!! YES.
Chocolate old fashions, glazed donuts & long maple bars?? O yeah! Better than Smith's Bakery, Yuu Yum, Krespy Kreme.
Put it on your bucket list. 👍😁👍<//Text>< pics>

Came in with very expensive auto repair cost. Vehicle had a lot of miles on it, easy wear. They offered a solution.  They offered me fair market value for my vehicle. Then they offered a great deal on a new auto.  After that I sent my oldest son over. He got the truck more than he thought he could be able to get.  P S other son being helped with a hand up.<//review>

Such a welcoming environment! After being treated poorly at a different dealership my wife and I were put off on buying a vehicle off a lot. However deciding to try a different lot we went to Chuck’s and it was a huge difference!!! Included my wife in conversations and made us very comfortable. At the end of the visit we left with a brand new vehicle and a peace of mind!<//Text>

<Review>We purchased 2 vehicles a 2017 Carolla and a 2017 ram Laramie. Their customer service is the worst. There is one guy working the dodge desk and if he doesn't feel you are worthy of having your truck looked at then it does and if not then they waste your time and then argue and argue until you leave. I wouldn't let the dodge guy look at my bicycle.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRwRu3pdQQM8dU_31FAFtzpI8dw-PL6Q-xMQqu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

In a matter of a few seconds, my entire life was destroyed in a collision. A Chuck Patterson Toyota dealership employee who was on a test drive smacked the rear end of my car as I turned into the bank. I am an excellent driver of 42 years. I am still in shock, physical pain and bewildered by how big corporations, insurance companies get away with ruining others’ lives. With A lack of caution for himself, or his pregnant customer I was hit. Where were his eyes looking? On the sale we presume?  By the Toyota driver not paying attention enough to see something in front of him, may have been a mistake, however it managed to total my vehicle and caused all kinds of issues, pain and destroyed my life.It was horrific! The brand new Toyota slammed into my 2002 Forester, bending the axil and tossing my car like a slingshot. It happened so fast. I always LOOK to see if a lane is clear when I enter it! It was clear! My car was my livelihood and without it my whole world is falling apart. I have several new health issues from the accident. It has been a very difficult time getting to doctor appointments, simple everyday errands, and grocery shopping. I had to stop my volunteer work, so now I sit home alone all day everyday just lonely and miserable. As a disabled senior whose world in one second was crushed by a big corporation. I’ve always worked hard helping others and was taught others should do the same. This transition was not easy. Now because Toyota and their lack of justice I’m not going to be able to go see my only son graduate from his University, as I no longer have my reliable Forester, and have new injuries. Nowhere to turn for help and I have no way of picking up the pieces and fixing all the damage it caused me. Toyota, as a big company, probably wasn't even affected at all! Really it was nothing at all to them. Big insurance companies don’t care. This financially ruined me. Thanks Chuck Patterson Toyota, Chico, CA.</text>

Had a very good experience. Jim Moore was very helpful with the whole process and any questions I had about my Jeep. Alicia Magnotta was very friendly and answered whatever questions I had about the paperwork. Great company. I even had to stay a little after hours to finish up getting my car insurance but everyone was very patient and nice about it. Definitely recommend.< /review>

I was working with Jeff on purchasing a new Toyota Venza and thought I had a deal in place before going to the dealership. I live 90 minutes away so I planned on getting a ride to pick up the car. I arrived to find that the car set for me was not the trim I wanted. Even worse, they sold the one I was going to purchase the night before, when I was working with Jeff via text and email. So it was one of two things: 1. He did not listen to my needs, which I made clear several times or 2. He thought he could pull a switch on me.

When I was getting ready to leave, the manager Erik came over and offered to try and find one from another dealer. He actually seemed to care about customer service and honoring the commitment. He asked for an hour to call and see what he can do. Over an hour passes and I give him a call. He does not answer and I did not receive a call back later.

I wish I would’ve known he would not bother calling me as I would’ve gone to the customers there to tell them in person about this terrible experience. I hope this helps and you consider shopping around elsewhere.< /review>

I was able to check in quickly and easily for my oil change, and I was even early. Justin was courteous and nice from when I arrived to the point which I left. While I was waiting in the lobby he came out about half way through and showed me pictures of my air filters to make sure I knew that they really needed to be replaced. Overall a quick, simple, pleasant experience!< /review>

< Review>
I was nervous making my first car purchase, but working with Kyle made it easy I swear! I'm sure working with any of the staff would me great too! Kyle made my experience very simple, understandable, and  tailored to me. I could tell he was a veteran at finding people just what they needed because after introducing himself he dove right into asking questions about me and what I wanted in a vehicle so he could guarantee my satisfaction. And whenever I had a question he always answered so thoroughly! His demeanor was also very easy to get along with. He was polite and patient. Now only will I be returning for my next vehicle but I would only recommend Chuck Patterson to friends and family.</Review>

<Review>A Great Experience at Chuck Patterson Toyota. Three days before I wanted to set up my service. I contacted the person at the appointment department and was given the day and time to have my service. Shaun Powell was the service adviser he was polite and entered all the things that my truck needed service oil change. and air bag recall he said it would take about two hours to complete. I was impressed at how informed he was as to how long it would take. He was rite on the money as to the time it would take.They checked the brakes, all the fluids and topped them off. The truck was clean and the free car wash was a bonus . It is nice to get great service that you can trust. They have my  business in the future.Thanks JUAN/VICTOR/MATT/CON The service tech.s< /Review>< Pictures>

Got a new Toyota RAV4 Prime at msrp, which was thousands less than many Northern California dealers are charging right now. The salesperson, Antonio, was great about keeping me informed about the process and getting all my information ahead of time so I could get in and out quickly (which was important to me due to COVID as well as general convenience). Everyone was wearing masks and the financing manager also volunteered to open both doors to her office to increase air flow. I went in knowing what I wanted and what I didn't want as far as add-ons but that said, there was no hard upsell. All in all a great experience!<//text>

Brian was a very professional and polite sales representative.  He found a vehicle with everything I asked for.  I have called him twice so far after the sale with questions.  He was very helpful.</review>

I was just looking...Well look no further, you will be met with very friendly, knowledgeable, and extremely honest staff.   You will not regret buying from Chuck Patterson.  I left with a new Rav 4 Hybrid after Brian, the salesman, enlightened me on the differences between gas only and hybrid.  Furthermore he spent the time showing me how everything works, and followed up a few days later inquiring if I had any questions. The General Sales Manager, Brad was thorough and provided multiple financing options to help fit my needs.  When it was time for me to sign on the dotted line I was met by Wendy, who helped me through the
paperwork, which made it quick and easy.  I was happily on my way after only a few minutes.  I highly recommend purchasing a vehicle here!< /Text>

The salesman Jeff was awesome! He knew just what we wanted and called us as soon as it came in. I drove away with my new Tacoma at 2:00 that afternoon! Haggling was almost non-existent and the finance person was low stress and not pushy at all! Overall a wonderful experience. Love Chuck Patterson Toyota!<//Text>

<review>I had a very pleasant buying experience at Chuck Patterson Toyota. I was able to test drive the truck I wanted, when I stated my budget no one tried to move me off of it, instead I felt that Antonio and Eric kept that number at the forefront of their minds. When I told them I needed to sleep on my decision they respected it and didn't push (too much 😁) that I take the truck. I really enjoyed working with the staff there and had a quick, pleasurable buying experience.< /review><Rating>5<//Rating>< GmapID>

BE WARNED! Do not do business with Heather, she was completely dishonest! Told us our recent payment to Toyota financial didn't show up in their system yet and we would be refunded the amount we paid, since the quote for what we owed was not accurate, based on that recent payment. We were lied to so that we would make the deal  and now she womt return phone calls. The most shady car salesperson ever!< /Review>

Most incredible car buying experience I have ever had. I wasn’t pushed to purchase, and was allowed to just take my time to comfortably decide what my options were. Our salesman, Ian, focused more on educating us about the different vehicles than trying to sell one to us, which I sincerely appreciated. This approach ultimately ended up with our purchase of a new RAV4 and we couldn’t be happier! Can’t say enough good things about this dealership. It meant a lot to have someone helping us that was less interested in pushing us and more interested in ensuring we got the best vehicle for our family at the best price. Extremely impressed with this dealership and their sales team!!<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>The buying experience was what you’d expect at a used car lot. They played all the games with making you wait on the manager, not being upfront about the total cost of the car, etc. This part was expected.

What I’m the most disappointed with is the follow up. Part of the deal was I’d get a second key made the following week. Instead I got complete radio silence.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x8082d886566db707:0xd2f53e72fb6d092< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Needed 2 more of these due to repairing my exhaust issue with my 06 D.C. 4X4, called Chuck Patterson to order these and they quoted me $20 a piece even though last time they charged me $12-15 each last time. Looked online (THANKFULLY), 2 different OTHER TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS had em listed at $10.41 EACH MARKED DOWN FROM $14.41, I asked if they'd be competitive an honor the price from the OTHER dealerships dude said no I can only mark em down to $15 each, I said koo, I'll order somewhere else at that price listed went online and got them for a total of $21.50 WITH SHIPPING from THE OTHER nearby Toyota Dealership.<//Text>< Time>

I didn't exactly expect to leave with a car...or maybe I did. I went there and I wanted a new car. I have been to car dealerships before. Anyway I think I got a pretty good deal and so far I'm very happy.<//Review>

Took my car here to replace a recalled airbag. I dropped it off in the morning, and they had it ready for me before lunchtime. Everyone I interacted with was super friendly and professional. I will definitely come here again.< /Text>

<review>Great service, no pressure sale, Ryan, and the financial manager, and Erik were all great to work with. We test drove on Sunday, no pressure, and decided to have the color we wanted, brought To Chico. Ryan did it all, had it there Wednesday.  Nice 2019 Toyota Tundra limited 4X4. Thanks again Gavin</review>< Rate>

Each of the employees who waited on me made me feel like they were there to making me happy. While maintaining a professional focus,
they lent themselves to some lively chatter, adding a warm, personal touch to the experience. To top it off, they offered me an incredible deal on a fantastic car. I would highly recommend Chuck Patterson Toyota.</review>

I was very hesitant about purchasing a used car. Search their inventory and found a car that looked nice at a reduced price. The car is very clean and in great shape. Also, (the sales team) Conrad, Billy, and Wendy made the process very easy! I am very satisfied with the level of service i received. The team found the lowest interest rate possible and even got a warranty for me!! Thank you Chuck Patterson!!!!< /Text>

<text>I took my Highlander in to have it checked. They wanted to charge me $7100 for a new hybrid battery and said it would take 2 to 4 days. My husband found a company that came to us replace the battery for free it took three hours and only cost me $2500.The service man that I talk to would not even look me in the eyes he spoke to my son I found him rude and condescending and I do not appreciate it just because I am a woman<//text><Rate>1< /Rate>< name>

<Text>5 stars for the service department. My car wouldn't pass smog and after spending $165 for a bunk diagnosis and a tampered gas cap (purchased from Patterson), Dr. of Motors tried to defraud me out of over $900 to replace the whole EVAP canister. Thank goodness I took it to the dealer, a diagnosis showed the brand new gas cap leak, there was nothing wrong with the canister. With a new gas cap, my car passed smog the first time. Thanks Bill and the Patterson service team!< /Text></record>

They incorrectly told my roommate he needed a transmission in a car with 80k miles, Turns out a brake light bulb that was out was causing the transmission module to go funky. It was a 5 dollar fix not a 5k fix. Dont ever bring your cars here.</Review>

John F and his team were terrific.  I never knew that buying a car could be so time efficient and relaxing.  They didn't try to change things or play games like I have had at other dealerships.  I love more car and Chuck Patterson staff completely changed my mind regarding buying a new car.  I highly recommend them.</text>

Our sales rep did a terrific job.  We placed our order and the next day the car came in with the wrong interior color. That evening the sales manager located the correct one out of the area and within 24 hours we drove away with our new car.  Great job.</Text>

Disappointed. Took my new Tacoma in for a service check around 4:15pm. The gentleman who helped me said I’d get a call about 45 minutes after for an update. 45 minutes goes by and I call them with follow up questions I forgot to ask while dropping off my truck. My questions were answered but there was so communication as to if my truck was ready for pick up or not.. nothing! After two hours of my truck being at the shop and NO communication from the service department, I decided to call and see what the heck was going on. Of course I only get their voice mail... I go down there around 6-6:15 to pick up my truck. Everything is closed down. My truck is parked out front by the door, UNLOCKED WITH THE KEYS INSIDE. No one called me to say my truck was ready to be picked up. You would think common sense would kick in around closing time when one of your customer’s vehicle is still there but no my truck was left there unlocked with the keys inside. AND too add to my disappointment someone had enough time to do a freakin Carfax vehicle history report, write down an incredibly awful offer, and leave it on my floor board to find. SO disappointed, the whole ordeal is unacceptable and unprofessional. I called to share my concerns and was just issued an apology... I will be planning my services else where back home, not here.</Text>

Had to go for a warranty issue on our car. I had never been there before. Peter and the entire service department were very swift, kind and efficient. Peter made sure to shake my hand and thanked me for coming in. On the way out, my husband spotted a nice truck that he is looking at purchasing: we will be back soon!< /Text>

Sales, Fantastic service!
Body shop, Excellent service!
Service, never again....
I had an oil change, tire rotation and windshield wipers replaced while my car was in for body work. $189.00, which they also changed an air filter I did not authorize. I received NO service check up report like other Toyota service centers offer, their rates are NOT within range of other centers and their phone service is rude and unacceptable. The window sticker for my next oil change doesn't even have the appropriate mileage for my car. I guess they figured since I'm a woman, I wouldn't notice. Next time, I will go to a Toyota Service Center that knows how to treat its customers with Respect.</review>

Avoid Chuck Patterson like the plague.  You would hope when you buy a $50,000 plus vehicle BRAND NEW that you would have a company stand by their product.  Especially when your vehicle is less than 8 months old and still under warranty.  They have given me nothing but grief and no one will return my phone calls.  So frustrating to be working with a business that cares so little about their customers.  Next time I'm taking my business somewhere else.  Anywhere else.<//Text>

This is my third vehicle I have purchased here and every time has been a great experience. This time was fabulous, we had a great sales man named Lawrence, very young guy. But very fun and professional and compassionate.  Then as the paperwork started Wendy made for a fun and great experience with the final paperwork.  Lots of laughs were shared with my mom and I and many staff members during this purchase.  I highly recommend Chuck Patterson for any vehicle perchase.</Review>

<Review>I got my rotors and brakes replaced at the service department which had exceptional service. I felt that they worked hard to get my service covered under warranty which made my week to not having to spend extra money, and they even put on more durable brakes and rotors than what I had before. Thanks!< /Review>< Pictures>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Two or three times a year (for several years) I will receive a mailer from them. It has a scratch off. If you get the winning number you win. I get the winning number every time. I've never won a prize worth claiming.

The catch is you have to go to the dealership to claim your prize. My opinion? It's a scam to get you in to the dealership. I once asked if anyone ever won the car or 25k dollars. They could not provide me with that info.

I wouldn't trust this business.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I must say that I am not just impressed with the service but more so with Darren who works in service for Dodge, Ram, ect.
I work with fleet trucks that are doing work in the Paradise area for recovery and restoration.  There was a recall on 3 trucks that needed fixed ASAP so people could get back to work.  Darren went out of his way to get each truck in and fixed right away without an appointment.  He even did the work himself and did not pass the job to someone else.  He was extremely fast and very professional.  They for sure gained me as a new costumer.
If I am in the area and need service I will not hesitate to call them for an appointment.

Thanks again Darren<//review>< pics>

I had an amazing experience working with the guys at Chuck Patterson. My previous car was absolutely awful, so I was being very picky about my next purchase. These guys were super helpful all along the way. I never felt pressured into making a purchase, they even suggested other models to help me make my decision. I would definitely recommend them to anyone in the future.<//text>

I purchased a vehicle, cash and 12 months later I still haven't gotten the title because the dealership made an error and said the truck was purchased with a loan.  On top of that I bough a brand new 2019 Tacoma and the motor blew at 8 months.  They did nothing to help me other than to say better luck next time.  I get the run around every-time I call in.  They just want your money and they don't care about the service you receive.  Disappointing.  Especially when these issues weren't my fault.  Buyer beware.<//review><Date>1574720154146< /Date>< Name>

<Review>This was my first time at Chuck Patterson Toyota.  I dealt with the service dept, my 2016 Tacoma needed a few recalls repaired.  I'm a First Responder  and depend on my truck.  The service dept was very polite and attentive.  Peter was who I talked to and he was more than helpful, he listened and knew exactly what I needed and explained the process completely (I was never second guessing my decision).  The truck was repaired and I picked it up the next day.  Up to this point the items that were repaired or replaced are working great.

Thank you

<Review>Would definitely recommend the service center! I had a appointment to get a recall service done on my car at 11am.Cy(the service advisor) said he would have me out of there by noon. I didn't believe that for one minute seeing as how busy the place was. It was just past 11:30 when Cy came to tell me my car was done! This will now be the ONLY place I bring my car to get serviced! Thanks guys!!!</Review>< UserId.>

<review>I was treated with disrespect the same day I  bought a car, a used 2016 Prius.  The gas tank read Empty, so that's  the way I  was expected to drive it off the lot.  When I  asked Nate Hart, who readily sold me the car, he said Chuck Patterson never puts gas in any used car they sell!!!  How shabby can you get?  I wish I  could rescind the whole deal.</review>< Pics>

Just had my second service from Chuck Patterson Toyota on my 2018 Rav4 Hybrid. They got me in right away and told me it would be 45 min and it was more like 30, so I was pleased with the extra time. Plus, I got a free Scrubbs car wash card. Highly recommend the dealership for both sales and service. :)< /review>

< Review>
Had talked with the Car sells man several times.
Told them I wanted a BLACK toyato Highlander. New.
A day before or 2 days before let them know I was for sure coming.
Did Not have a black new highlander
Ended up with 1, 2 years old.
Went for a new one. Probably Last car of my life..
Tried to show me how to work control s and radio, while I was test driving the car.
I am OLD. It's in my ga8,haven't driven it since.
Gotta wait for the Kid to come at end of FIRE SEASON.
BUT he was polite, and spoke ENGLISH.<//Review>

<text>My husband and I have been dealing with C Patterson for many years.  When we started it was a family run business and we were treated like family. I can truly say that I still get the same feeling even though C Patterson has grown. I am treated with friendly
respect,  starting with the person who meets me at the service driveway, Peter and then when the valet brings me my car.
Peter keeps me informed of the progress when I'm waiting.  If I am not waiting, I'm contacted when done.
I hope it never changes.<//text>< user>

<Text>I bought a used 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee from Chuck Patterson last year. It's a nice car and I have been happy with it. At the time of purchase I asked the salesman "Frank" a lot about the car; where it came from, previous history, accidents...asked for Carfax. Frank assured me that the car came from Sacramento and had never been in an accident. (My bad for not demanding proof) After I bought the car Frank decided he should clean out the glove box. I noted that he removed what appeared to be a repair order. When I asked to see it he told me that he couldn't do that because it had the name of the previous owner on it and cited "privacy issues."

Recently I was shopping for new insurance and the agent said to me "did you know your Jeep has been involved in two accidents?" I was shocked. It had apparently been in a accident just months before I purchased it. As I said,  I love the car and may very well have bought it anyway but THEY INTENTIONALLY LIED TO ME!

I will never do business with this dealership again and will tell everyone I know that they are dishonest and unethical people.<//Text>< Pictures>

Very good experience. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and they were fair and professional in the way we negotiated my trade-in. The one thing is make sure you ask how much the warranty costs and any other add ons. I felt rushed to make those decisions more quickly than I would have liked.<//Review>

<Review>I just got a new RAV4, and after going to multiple dealerships I can honestly say that Chuck Patterson was the best.  They were informative, not pushy, and I never once felt like I was being taken advantage of.  The GM Brad was especially awesome, as was Antonio, one of the sales people.  If you need a new car, go here, because you will be dealing with honest people that care about you getting exactly what you want.< /Review><Name>Kallie Berg</Name><rate>5< /rate>< pictures>

WORST possible service EVER. For literally everything. The sales experience was awful. No communication with us or between the other workers. It was seriously IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of anyone over the phone and still is. The position we were in this was the only dealership that was able to get my gf approved so didn't have much of a choice. Which is extremely unfortunate because they are such a nightmare to work with. Took the car in to be serviced. No one called when it was ready for pick up. So had to go in to find out the shop closed. Never had a pleasant experience with this dealership and cannot believe it's so hard to get through to someone on the phone or even get a call back. Would NEVER reccomend purchasing a car from them. I'm not even sure how they have such a high rating and positive comments. Haven't seen anything good come from them. If you're looking for a good dealership to work with go to Chico Nissan!!<//review>

The guys in the body shop are magicians! They were able to match one of the most difficult colors around. From Don S. being a complete professional and Nicholas P. being a totally caring manager, the experience was 5 Star. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle to Chuck Patterson's.</review>

<review>Seriously - the dudes at Chuck Patterson Toyota are the best! The ladies too. This company truly goes above and beyond to take care of their people - we are so glad to be part of their people. Whenever our vehicle needs an oil change - they always make sure to take acre of LRT Graphics vehicle, as well as my personal ones. We've had the pleasure of working with Chuck Patterson for a number of different vehicles and are always thrilled with the ease of doing so.

.This place is a fraud and they absolutely do not care about providing quality service or any service but they are very comfortable charging outrageous fees for doing nothing. Do not go here for service after they assured me my 200k mile car was perfectly fine and no maintenance was needed and charging me some crazy amount for doing nothing.less than two weeks later my car completely cropped out on me due to spark plugs being put in wrong. Something they should have noticed had they done an actual inspection.  I loved my extremely rare Cotolla XRS and thanks to their laziness and horrible business practices my beloved car is no longer bringing me the joy of driving.</text>

<Text>I took my car in because I thought I had a major problem with the rear brakes in my 2008 Toyota Corolla. Turns out, no major problems, just a piece of rock that found its way into the rear drum. Darren, the Toyota service person that I talked to, was honest and gave me information on the braking system of my car. I use my Toyota Corolla to make my living, so it is imperative that it's in good running condition. Thanks Darren, and rest of the great crew, at Chuck Patterson's!<//Text>< pics>

Check your credit after you visit.
I was interested in trading my car in and wanted to look around, so I asked around and got shown good cars. Wondered how much it would be monthly if I trade in and they asked for some basic background information. I made sure no credit check was gonna be made about 3 times and sure enough 4 CREDIT CHECKS. I would have said no if they didn't lie so bad. But would not recommend going in person or asking for estimates.< /Review>

Seriously - the dudes at Chuck Patterson Toyota are the best! The ladies too. This company truly goes above and beyond to take care of their people - we are so glad to be part of their people. Whenever our vehicle needs an oil change - they always make sure to take acre of LRT Graphics vehicle, as well as my personal ones. We've had the pleasure of working with Chuck Patterson for a number of different vehicles and are always thrilled with the ease of doing so. The team here really knows their stuff - thank you guys for always making things easy.< /Text>

Exceptional Employees, Chuck Patterson Toyota

I recently purchased a new Toyota Camry and was fortunate to work with two excellent Chuck Patterson representatives. My initial contacts were online with Michelle Carroll. Michelle is a delightful, knowledgeable, and helpful employee who answered all of my questions in a polite and professional manner. The actual demonstration and sale of the vehicle was performed by Eric Anderson, who is well versed and has the ability to explain all of the vehicle functions and programs in a way that can be easily understood.

Whether considered as individuals or as a team, these employees deserve recognition for their exceptional service to me, the customer, and to the Chuck Patterson organization.<//Review>

We went to just "look" at a new car for my wife and the deals were just to good to pass up. Everyone we dealt with so nice and we left with a beautiful new rav4 that we absolutely love. Miguel, Robbie, Leon and Jamie all took great care of us. Thanks Chuck Patterson!!!< /Review>

Three purchases here. Two vehicles defective immediately after leaving the lot. One needed a valve job and the other had emissions issues shortly after leaving the transaction. I decided to give Patterson another shot, by buying a new truck, instead of a used vehicle. If you plan to do that, take someone to inspect and Provide feedback. As to the last transaction, everything was fine, except when it came to the mismatch between orally agreed upon terms and the written instrument. Make sure you and whoever you work with in finance know and understand  and the numbers. A lot can change between the pitch and the actual deal. Feel free to contact me for more detail. I have documents to substantiate these claims.< /Text>

Service staff are always attentive, thorough in explaining any service, prices are competitive and it is easy to deal with keeping my car maintained through Chuck Patterson.  I'm on my second Prius since 2005, and it has been a pleasure to work with this company in all respects.<//Text>

<user>109817899121160170844< /user>< review>
Chuck Patterson reached a new low in customer service today. We purchased our Toyota Prius seven years ago and have had terrible service with each visit, but today they even surpassed their typically abysmal record. They refused to honor the extended warranty refund program because of some fine print on the document sold to us seven years ago. They may no attempt to contact us about our refund or notify us of the 60 day refund window (after 7 years!) and the shark of a salesman that sold it to us said nothing about the impossibly short refund window. Worst of all the finance officer and general manager were completely unapologetic. All that we required was that they show some empathy and provide is with a credit toward service or some small token of compassion and we would have left disappointed, rather than disgusted. Instead they passed all blame onto us and said "too bad... it's your fault". I told them I would never buy a car their again and their answer was, "well that's fine with us." Pathetic! No wonder Chuck Patterson has a one star ratting on Yelp.< /review>

< Review>
The worst experience I have ever had trying to buy a car. They said they had the car I wanted 3 times, when actuality they did not. They called me at 5:30 the night before I was suppose to sign the papers to say they could not get the car. They lied, and deceived us. My family has bought every car we have owned from them and I would have expected some honesty, but we will never buy a car from them again. Be careful if you are thinking of buying a car from them.</Review>

<Review>Two men from Chuck Patterson came to the house and jump started my car and took it back to the shop.  I had just had some body work done on the driver's door.  They tested the battery and replaced the battery.  Then they returned my car to me.  NO CHARGE.  They said when they worked on the door they might have left the door open, hence the battery could have run down. I was amazed at the service and the no charge.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>The worst experience I have ever had trying to buy a car. They said they had the car I wanted 3 times, when actuality they did not. They called me at 5:30 the night before I was suppose to sign the papers to say they could not get the car. They lied, and deceived us. My family has bought every car we have owned from them and I would have expected some honesty, but we will never buy a car from them again. Be careful if you are thinking of buying a car from them.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x8082d886566db707:0xd2f53e72fb6d092</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
When I made the appointment the fella was real nice but when I went in and explained that my car leaked onto the floorboard when driving in the rain it was very different.
I found myself dealing with a very smug cranky employee.  He snapped questions at me like, "where is the leak" with an attitude that I was disturbing him while he sat guzzling beer during the Superbowl.
When I reiterated I didn't know that information (if I had I would have said that in the beginning and probably have fixed it myself!) he grunted it would cost me $180 just to look at it! After I picked myself up off the floor I thanked him for all of his "help" with as much insincerity as I could muster and left.
After that experience I would never do business with them again!
I should have listened to the two different warnings I had received before going there!<//Review>

Horrible service especially in the Jeep department, they would never call my insurance back and acted like they were too busy even though they were being paid to do so. It literally took months to fix my car. I also asked about an oil change and tire rotation since it was already in the shop for the day FINALLY being fixed, they wanted to charge me $120 wow a scam.< /review>

Careful there in the funny business not the service. Have had my car in for warranty electric problem three times it's now numerous eletrical problems cost me 500.00 and the issue i brought it in for has gotten worse. However i do now have a new battery, and am not sure if it wouldn't be better to have it towed to Sacramento.<//text>

Best customer servicer and the employees were very helpful and everything. They helped me with my very first hand car which it's a 2018 Toyota Corolla LE and it's very different for me because I use drive a 2000 Honda Accord LX V6 VTEC  and this one has so many specs and such as touch screen radio which I never had. Overall this car is completely a huge upgrade coming from a person who drives the 90's car. Thank you!!< /review>

<review>I have purchased two new Tundra trucks from Chuck Patterson.   Every time I go there,  I find it almost impossible to locate a parking spot.  If I do find one,  it is inches away from the next vehicle.   I have learned from employees that there are many minor accidents that occur while they  are moving vehicles from one spot to another.   They assured me that they also have a body shop on the premises and can fix any damage that they do.   WHAT!!!!!!,  I do not want any damage done to my vehicle when I just brought it in for an oil change!!!   I paid a fortune for this truck. Also,  they are so cheap now that they do not even give you a car wash ticket .  I may be going elsewhere for my next new vehicle.   Suggestion:   Maybe move your body shop or other departments  to a different location which will allow room for more customers to park.</review><date>1479914018540< /date><gmap_id>0x8082d886566db707:0xd2f53e72fb6d092</gmap_id>< userid>

After a week I called and they told me another week. Then yesterday I was told it would be done, never heard from them even though they said they would call,so I called them and they said it still needed muffler repairs and that it would be done later in the afternoon or possibly today. Just called them and they said it won't be done till tomorrow. I appreciate the work they are doing but don't appreciate being told several different completion dates and having it pushed back servers times. The staff is friendly but they don't get the job done when they say they will I am beyond annoyed because of this, I just want my car back and they can't even give me a correct day of completion.< /text>< Pics>

Charged me extra $70.. very sad..Five years later new truck spent 32K with trade in. Smog diesel....oh OK.... engine light comes on......water in fuel, bad thing in diesel.. Checked, had tools for that....oh bad sensor....Uh oh... again.. no tool to replace sensor,, told "no one has one", it won't be in for a month.. Checked. phone call to Patterson twice ..Service manager.. no return call.. Fine just tell me you don't like service work, I get it, it doesn't pay as much. Now driving extra 40 miles to get it done. + had to pay $50 extra to DMV for two month extension, hopefully this gets fixed..  So disappointed in Chuck Patterson, They'll never get a dime from me again. The way business competition is in this day in age, you would think they would step it up a notch or two or ten........<//Review>< rating>

<Text>I test drove a green 2012 Prius with a back up camera.  Salesman Frank said I could have it for around 20k in 2015.  He took me over to the sales office and the guy wrote up the sale, which with interest, came to about 24k, I signed.  He gave me the keys to the car and I got in and drove it.  Noticed it did not seem to have a back up camera.  Came to find out "Frank" had pulled a "bait and switch."  He sold me a Prius III or IV, but gave me a Prius II.  The actual value of which was about 2 or 3k less than the one I drove.  Long story short, as of July 2018, a little over 3 years later, after paying it off, the Kelly Blue Book value is only 10,800.00.
DONT BUY FROM FRANK at Chuck Patterson.  Actually I was told later that John Sullivan in Orland or Corning is much more honest.<//Text><Name>Mary Nordskog-Lopez</Name>< resp>

Safety is not their concern. I called to inform the management of shoddy work their "professional service techs" did and the customer relations lady hung up on me. The general manager is not professional at all and wouldn't listen to my concern.
I barely use the word hate because it's very strong. I more than hate that unprofessional dealership.</Review>

After a mix up with my scheduled appt I was given another appt which I returned for.  I live 45 minutes away so having a mix up on appt basically sent me over the edge.  The shop manager took care of me that day.  I returned for the other appt and shop manager took very good care of me.  The lobby waiting area is very nice with free wi-fi, tv, music, coffee n cookies (that day).  I probably waited for my vehicle close to an hour.  Very nice building, bathrooms, clean.  All in all this shop manager employees here went out of their way to make you feel comfortable.< /Review>

<Text>Worst customer service ever. When a maintenance reminder light was not reset following an oil change,  I called to find out what to do, I was told to ask Google. And that was the end of that. So I bought my new Toyota Prius at Oroville Toyota NOT Chuck Patterson. Poor customer service leads to lack of sales. I was very happy that there was another choice for my Toyota purchase and that I did not have to put up with Chuck Patterson's poor customer service and attitudes. They have become too big for their britches. I live in Paradise and so I have a choice. Chico or Oroville. Oroville Toyota wins.<//Text>< rate>

< review>
I am appalled at the customer service, work ethic, and knowledge in the service and parts department. I had to call redding to order parts after calling Chuck Patterson's parts department and they told me to call Riebes for a dealer specific item. I dread having to do any business with this place because their employees  (not all of them) are so unprofessional. I've had a cigarette flicked on my car by a service truck driver, had to listen to other businesses slandered by a tow truck driver. The parts department has ordered many wrong parts for me and screamed at me on the phone for their incompetence.. I'll be dealing with Redding for now.<//review>

While a good dealership with nice services, overpriced used and new cars.
Often 5-10% of MSRP on new. Almost 100% over on some used cars.< /review>

<username>Brook Rollins< /username><Time>1477018153874<//Time><rating>1</rating><Text>I have had multiple bad experiences with the service department at Chuck Patterson. After dealing with them today I will never go back. It looks like it's going to be better for me to drive to Yuba City or Red Bluff (from Magalia) than deal with them again. I've also noticed that they have a really high turnover of staff in the service department. Every time I go there (and I've been getting regular maintenance done on my car for the last 3 years there) it's a new person and many of them are not very knowledgeable. From my observation there is definitely a problem with the way things are being run there. The fiasco I dealt with today was the final straw. Save yourself time, money, and energy- don't go to Chuck Patterson.</Text>< pictures>

I purchased a used 2013 Prius in February 2016 with under 50000 miles. About 6 months into it the Bluetooth began cutting out and disconnecting the phones thus not being legal to comply with the California hands free law. Also it does not allow music to be streamed from a laptop or other device. It was somewhat intermittent and when I took it in and had it checked out it was working and there was nothing they could do until it was out when I brought it in. A few weeks later when driving nearby to the selling dealer it went out, had the Toyota service technician set in the car and he said the Bluetooth portion was indeed defective. when they called I was told that the "Cellular Telephone" was the only part of the radio that was not covered by our $2700+ warranty. So unless another function failed there was nothing they could do. FYI upon purchase I remember asking the finance person if the radio and Bluetooth was covered, and was told "everything except wear and tear items are covered bumper to bumper". I believe I was misled by the selling dealer and they were not willing to "JUST MAKE IT RIGHT" I would not be so upset except I asked this specific question beforehand, "does the warranty cover the radio and the Bluetooth" Had they told us this in the first place it very well may had swayed my extended warranty purchase. Not happy with Chuck Patterson Toyota of Chico, Ca</text>

Chuck Patterson Toyota Has A BBB Rating of "A-" because it has made some good faith efforts to resolve customer issues. Lithia Toyota of Redding has an "F" rating because it steadfastly refuses to address customer complaints and issues. Lithia Management asked me to leave the premises, when I confronted them with the BBB written report.  Buyer beware UPFRONT!<//Text>

<Review>After receiving the worst service from Lithia Toyota in Redding, my husband started talking to Eric (internet sales) at Chuck Patterson.  They had the truck we wanted and were able to talk to the bank we were financed through.  They texted us and told us we were good to go and we could come get the truck.  Got to Chico and Eric was off, but Brendan was there to help make it a easy.  It took about an hour and we were outta there with our new 2016 Tacoma!  Thanks guys...I will be back soon.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x8082d886566db707:0xd2f53e72fb6d092</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We contacted CP to purchase our 1st straight from the lot, new car. We decided to buy on Labor Day weekend because of the great sales. When we showed up around 5:00pm, Brad Marr greeted us and we sat down for a few min. He introduced us to Dallas, we told him we wanted to drive the Corolla LE, the Camry and the Prius, and we were off for some test drives. We had a great time testing out the different vehicles, and settled on the Corolla. There really was no haggling on the price as we did our homework prior to the day and new the prices were fair already with all of the incentives and bonuses and such. After realizing that the 2015 Corolla's did not have the 0% apr, we settled on the 2014. The paperwork was drawn up in approx. 15 min and we signed in about 5 minutes, it took Dallas longer to program my wifes' cell phone to the blue-tooth in the car than it did to do the paperwork (and he did it pretty quick), that was awesome. All around great bunch of guys/gals at Chuck Patterson and can't wait to buy my 1st New truck from them. Brad was instrumental in the sale of this vehicle by making my wife comfortable (not having ever bought a New car) and Dallas did a great job as well. From the sales Manager to the salesman to the young lady in financing, absolutely great experience. A+ in my book.....

Thank you Chuck Patterson Toyota/Scion/Dodge of Chico.< /text>

Was greeted quickly but it was obvious that the sales people quickly decided I wasn't worth their time and after about 1 minute there it was near impossible to get anyone to even acknowledge my existence.

I had already done a lot of research but I was going into the dealer to see the cars in person and ask a few very specific questions before deciding if I wanted to buy or not.  I could not get anyone to show me the car I actually wanted to see.  Even after I hunted someone down and asked again I was told that maybe I should go look in one of their other lots on the other side of the street then the salesman just walked away.  I never got most of the questions I had answered.

Realistically there is only one Toyota Dealer in each community so if I do buy a new car I probably have to go to them but their service was bad and their staff was very unfriendly.  If there was another choice I would probably not go back to them.

(To be fair after about an hour I finally got in touch with one guy who was part of the Patterson family and did attempt to answer my questions.  While he couldn't provide all the information I needed he did try to help and was very friendly)</Review>

<text>I would LOVE to tell you why you should avoid this dealership!! Mainly the service department. After our last service, the air pressure light came on. The tires seemed to be fine, and the light would be off and on, so we thought maybe it was just temperature changes that were to blame. Eventually, it stayed on, and a few weeks ago we noticed the front passenger side tire was visibly going flat. We had since moved to Rocklin, so I took it to the Toyota dealership here, who discovered when filling the tire that this little pin that holds in the air was broken. They said that whomever filled the tire last broke it. Well, guess who filled the tire last....Chuck Patterson Toyota!! The dealership here said they could fix it, but if they broke the sensor in the process, it would be $300 to replace. I told them I was going to call Chuck Patterson, because no way should I have to pay for something that they broke. So they filled the tire, explained to me that the tire would just start slowly seeping air again, and the light would come back on soon.

My husband called Chuck Patterson yesterday. They agreed to fix it.....for $250. Their reasoning? "Because it's been so long." Really? Because we are just barely to our next service date and haven't even reached the mileage yet. Not to mention that the light came on right after YOU serviced it and only YOU have touched that pin. The air was seeping slowly, so we assumed the light was a glitch, and we didn't even realize there was a problem until a few weeks ago. We took it in as soon as we realized it. Oh, and they also said "those can break at any time". Interesting, because the dealership here specifically told me that the last person who filled the tire broke it.

We paid a lot of money for that warranty that requires us to come back to Toyota for all our service appointments. We should be able to have a reasonable expectation that one of your employees isn't going to break something that is going to cost us hundreds of dollars to fix. I understand that mistakes happen, but what matters to me is how you handle it. THAT is customer service. And your customer service sucks, quite frankly.

My husband and I both drive Toyotas...in fact, my husband bought his Camry at your dealership. Since you refuse to fix this without charging us for YOUR mistake, believe me when I say that we will never buy another Toyota again, and definitely not from your dealership. Toyota isn't the only company out there that makes a safe and reliable vehicle. I would encourage anyone else out there in the market for a vehicle to steer clear of this dealership. They obviously do not adhere to the level of customer service that one would expect at Toyota.</text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) The service attitude is very good👍, the staff are very patient👍, I don’t know English where the staff is very patient with mobile phone translation, I went to Toyota to buy a car on the 9th, and I was very worried when I went there 😅😅 I am very happy to proceed very smoothly 😄😄👍🤝 Thank you very much to every salesperson, that guy is very patient to help me with the procedures. Thank you very much. 👍👍👍

服务态度非常好👍，员工非常有耐心👍，我不会英语哪里员工用手机翻译非常有耐心，我9号去丰田汽车买车，去的时候非常担心😅😅不会英语买不到，我很高兴非常顺利进行😄😄👍🤝非常感谢每一位销售员，那个小伙子非常有耐心帮我办理手续我非常感谢您。👍👍👍<//Text>
