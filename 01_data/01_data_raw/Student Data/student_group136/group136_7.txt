We hired Hacking Immigration Law for our mandamus case. If it weren't for Hacking Immigration Law, we would be still waiting indefinitely for our green card. I'm very thankful to their efforts and i can't recommend them enough. The whole team is both amiable and professional, always prompt in their responses. We could feel that the team is knowledgeable and they always kept us updated throughout the process. Most importantly, we could feel that Jim and his team truly care about the welfare of the applicants and are willing to do what it takes to uphold the law, even if against the immigration system that can be biased and unfair.<//text>

After asking Jim a question in regards to my case. I decided to file a mandamus with Hackings Law and I’m very thankful for not only them doing their job and succeeding but because throughout the process they were always very responsive. If I sent an email within the hour I would get a reply back. The process went smoothly and thank God all went well. So I would recommend Jim and Haley and the law firm in general. They are truly great!< /review>

<Text>Hacking Law is Excellent law firm. They are professional and friendly.  English is not my 1st language, and sometime it's hard to understand everything. They try to level with you and explain in a different way, Even when they're busy, they give you they full attention. It was great working with each and everyone in that office I recommend them to anyone   looking for Excellent lawyers.<//Text>< user>

Amazing! To say the least my case wasn't an easy one but with the competence of Hacking Law firm, it felt like a breeze. I am blessed to have found this team & was so fortunate to work with attorney Amany Hacking- A wonderful and kind person I've met so far.

After nearly a year and  a half  stuck in USCIS 221g Administrative Processing I decided to contract with Jim Hacking  to file a Writ of Mandamus lawsuit.  His team moved very quickly in initiating  the process. Within 2 weeks of all parties being served my case started moving forward. 30 days after filing the embassy reached out to us to schedule our file up appointment and submit any documents that had expired during the process. Due to the efforts of Hum and his team our daughters immigrant visa was FINALLY approved! I highly recommend Hacking Law Practice!<//text>

Jim and his team are top notch! Not only do they keep the immigrant community informed with live sessions on YouTube, but they also provide aggressive case management as Jim and his team are extremely creative thinking outside the box. I believe the prices are more than fair and he is a great addition from Missouri serving the SoCal community!< /Text>

The requests from my Congressman and Senator brought vague answers and no forward movement. The Hacking Law Practice filed a Writ of Mandamus suit on our behalf in August and by mid December we had the answers for our K1 and K2 petitions. We spent our first Christmas together in our home here in Texas. Without the efforts of Jim Hacking’s office we would still be waiting. I strongly recommend them if you want an answer to petition. No one can guarantee a “yes” but without an answer, it is impossible to make plans for life. Don’t delay.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

< review>
Years ago I stopped going here cause they didn't change the oil filter and when I asked why they said they did but my frahm was still on my vehicle even though they used only pennzoil at that time.
I was in a rush this past weekend after working 7 days a week, thought I'd give them another chance on my wife's mercedes. Big mistake. Now the hood sensor keeps flashing even though I've closed the hood a thousand times.</review>

I would appreciate an appropriate estimated time, I waited because it was only going to be a 40 minute wait, it took over 2 hours. Honestly I would have been happy to leave and return if I would have been told the actual estimated time.</Review>

<text>Took my Corolla in for an oil change as a first time customer. There was another customer saying he had been there for two hours for a tire rotation and an oil change. I ignored it thinking his was a special situation but gave him the benefit of the doubt because there were only two cars in the shop: mine and his. Then it took them 40 minutes to tell me they can do no better than $90 for just an oil change. I asked if they can do anything besides synthetic oil and they told me no. They didn't get my business. Called pep boys right after and they gave me a wide range of options for oils and got me set up with an appointment. Even the toyota dealer said they would charge me $55. Not coming here again.</text>< Pictures>

Went in to change my brakes and get new rotors. Craig and John were very respectful the entire time. Other issues were found with my car as they worked on it but they were detailed and in depth about what they found, the causes, and what they were going to do to rectify the issues, which nowhere I've been before has anyone been so detailed and thorough to me. They've definitely made it my go to place when I need anything for my car. Thanks you two, I really appreciate it!< /review>

I went in for a standard oil change and was told an amount higher than what I’m used to and I asked to confirm that it was for conventional oil since it was high and the guy with the manager jacket confirmed that was. I looked at the receipt when I got home and realized he charged me for Signature synthetic oil. Who knows what actually got put in.< /Review>

Needed an oil change and I was helped as soon as I pulled up. Craig, Jesus, and Daniel took great care of my truck. The service was done in a timely manner. To my surprise they went above and beyond my expectations.  I previously had a bad experience at a different jiffy lube but these guys really know what they are doing and we're super friendly. I'm definitely going back for my next oil change even though I don't live in the area ☺< /text>

Used to like this place, but the last time I went the job was not done very well. I decided to save a few dollars and do my own oil change. Upon getting under my vehicle the seal was not completely on. The oil seal was not securely on. It came off right as I touched the oil seal. The was oil all over the undercarriage of my vehicle and when I drained the oil it wasn't even enough to fill a milk jug. My oil filter appeared to be used since it was printed as a reusable filter with hand writing all over it. (I'm fairly sure my receipt showed I payed for a new one. The job was done very sloppy. I'm going to be doing my own oil change for now on.</text>

<Text>No one would ever believe this story. So I took my vehicle to this location to get my brakes done.  When I arrived, I was greeted by a technician that told me to take a seat, and he would get back to me about 30 minutes later a female came and took my information and stated the cost of my breaks which included the charge to replace my wheel locks because I lost my key. The technician came to me and said that he needs to take my vehicle "down" the street because he did not have the correct tool to remove the lock. 20 minutes went by, 30 minutes went by, 40 minutes went by; I was starting to get worried. I asked another technician if he knew where the other guy went he said he didn't know and he would call him. So, he called him and he said that he was 30 minutes away. I said tell that guy to bring my vehicle back NOW! As the guy arrived, I asked where did you go! He claimed he went down the street, but they didn't have the tool. I was pissed, so I left! I went over to American Tires to see if they can remove my wheel lock a technician came to me and said sir, "didnt we already tell you that we cant remove your wheel lock." I said, "No I have never been here' then he said, but your truck was." He gave me a recommendation to a place that can remove my wheel lock. I immediately went to that location. Once my wheel lock was removed, I went to Brake Depot to get new breaks. The technician at break deport said, sir, "If you are here about removing your wheel locks again, we already said that we cant do it." I told the technician at break depot that I have never been here. The technician at break depot said well your vehicle was. I realized that the technician at this location Jiffy Lube drove my vehicle to varies places throughout Riverside trying to get my wheel lock removed vice just telling me that it couldn't be done. Very unprofessional!<//Text>< Pictures>

Good/fast service; staff is great.

Prices are outrageous though... just under $110 for full synthetic. I looked up prices on Amazon (while in the waiting room), and found the exact same oil (6 quarts) for under $50 (including shipping), and that's not even discounted bulk rates. Mark-ups are required to run a business, but this is ultimately price gouging. Look for coupons online.< /Review>

I stopped there it was like 6:50 am and Anthony came out to greet me.  The shop doesn't open until 7 am but Anthony was great he opened up early for me and was just really very nice and professional. I told him I was concerned because I was very low with my oil and I had to get to work but was afraid with it being that low.  He reassured me that it would be ok. He noticed that my blinker was out and he fixed that for me, put in the quart of oil and answered all my questions.  I explained to him that I had lost my husband and that he always took care of this for me.  Anthony told me if I get my next oil change done there that I can stop by any time and it is free to get my fluids check and topped off.  Very nice young man, very friendly, courteous  and professional.  I will be back there to get my oil changed there as soon as I can and I recommend this place to all woman who need little things like this done where you can trust someone.

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I went here because i needed an inspection done and was only in the area a day so I hadnt bothered booking an appointment elsewhere. They told me my tires and brakes were bad along with a light out. I was fairly perplexed given that all the tires were less than 2 years old and I'd looked at them prior to coming in. And there was certainly no apparent issue with the brakes. There was a light out but it wasnt any important light needed for inspection. Brought it to another place the next day highlighting to the mechanic the things that were apparently wrong.he looked it over and said everything was fine. He brought me over and explained when things should be looked at over the coming year. But there was no reason my car shoudnt pass inspection. Thank god I'd brought it elsewhere rather than pay for the BS repairs here.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Last visit to this location.  First,  tried to upsell me on items I had replaced just 3 months ago,  and had no answer when I questioned them on it.  Second,  they left a ton of grease all over my door handle,  steering wheel,  gear shift,  etc.  Very disappointed in a place I used to come to quite often. I hate to be negative,  but I would recommend going elsewhere until this location makes some improvements.< /text>

<time>1487544010048<//time><rating>1</rating><text>I won't go back here. I brought in my new Nissan Altima for an oil change a little before 5k miles. I had brought my other Nissans here for the past few years and was always able to get a conventional oil change for less than $50. The guy tells me it will be over $100 because my vehicle "must have" full synthetic oil, that they "could not use anything other than the full synthetic." What choice did I have? I didn't know any better, so I agreed to it. Fast-forward another 5k miles and it's time for another oil change. I went to the dealership for a 10k check up and asked them about the full synthetic oil thing. I was told that, while full synthetic had its advantages, it wasn't a necessity; the vehicle can use conventional oil.

The guys at this Jiffy Lube lied and took advantage of me because I didn't know any better. I'm angry about this and will be reporting them to their corporate offices and the better Business Bureau. It's completely unacceptable.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1487808377406, 'text': 'Robin, providing your Nissan Altima with quality oil changes is important to our Jiffy Lube.

<Text>I was charged $100 for an oil change. I have never paid more than $30-40 for an oil change in my entire life. They told me my car “required” a specific oil and that’s why it cost so much which is robbery. Waited over an hour for completion of service $41 for labor? Never coming back here.</Text>< username>

I looked up jiffy lube prices online to which I decided to drop off my truck.  They call me 10 min later and advise me that my truck needed repairs which I ssvisrd them I only needed the synthetic oil change. They wanted to charge me almost a hundred dollars! I advised the young lady on the phone what I had found online and she told me it must of been for s different store.  I just looked up the information again and it clearly states $59.99. Totakku felt ripped off!</Text>

Went in with a $5 off coupon. When my daughter went to pay they wouldn't honor it because my truck had a factory skidplate. REALLY?? Tried to reason with manager and said I had several cars right behind that one to be done. Didn't matter. Took rest of my cars  to GT Import service station on Hole right after leaving Jiffy and they had a rate LOWER than Jiffy's coupon rate! Guess what? They don't charge to take off a factory skidplate when they change the oil. No one else I called (Valvoline Service Station) does either for that matter. Jiffy - you lost my 5 cars at least 2 x's a year. I tried to warn you that would happen!
Funny, not too many others below this comment have had a positive experience either. Wonder why........< /review>

<text>I took my car here for service & was treated like a queen they went way above the call of service to make me happy I had different services done. If you want to feel special & know you are getting a great deal go talk to Jesse he will explain everything in detail & he is honest & professional. If he dont think you need it he's not going to tell you to get it.
I feel bad I don't remember the name of the guy that did the work on my car but when he was done he made sure he took me to my car & walked me thur everything he did showing me everything all fuild levels.
Thank you guys for taking care of my car as if ut was yours....

Love Golden Gate Park and Lindley Meadow is just one of the many places they have to throw a party. Rented this place for my dads 60th surprise bday barbecue and it went great. I picked tables 3&4 and it was perfect distance away from other people's party's. The only thing that sucks is to rent a jumper u can't bring ur own u have to pick one from a list of approved jumper vendors and the distance from parking to tables could b difficult when setting up for a party. So make sure to have plenty if strong helpers with ya. Other wise its great.<//review>

< review>
Hardly Strictly Bluegrass is San Francisco's premier outdoor music festival, and the one that best captures the spirit of the city's musical legacy. Lindley Meadow is a big part of that. On regular days, it's dotted with picnics and lawn revelers, but during festivals, it's plastered with tarps and coolers. It is capable of hosting a wonderful atmosphere.</review>

Nice large grassy field. Some picnic tables. Not too far from restroom. There’s no wind here. It’s sitting in a location that is blocked to wind.</Review>

Lindley Meadow is beautiful, especially when the cherry blossoms are in bloom! Perfect large open  green space for exploring! There are posted signs saying dogs must be leashed, but unfortunately there were several people ignoring them.</review>

I came here for Tour de Fat. Really its as good as any other part of Golden Gate park, but if you are a big soccer fan this would be a great place to go!</review>

Beautiful sprawl of grass. Be careful though. There are multiple mud pustules scattered through the grass.< /review>

Wide open space, clean, with plenty of open space between picnic areas. Parking has not been an issue when you come early enough. No signs regarding location of picnic areas, so easy to get lost when looking for your party.< /review>

Beautiful lawn. I went on a cold windy day 5/29/21 but the Meadow was still full of people gathering masks and enjoying outdoor activities and music. I like that the park has super tall trees in the back which make a lot of noise in the wind.< /Text>

< Review>
I had a very good experience with Express Electrical Services. George is one of the most responsive, helpful, conscientious professionals I have worked with. He thoroughly diagnosed the issues (due to it being an older home,) outlined every part of the process, showed me the functions after the major steps, and ensured I was satisfied with the results. He took extra care to ensure the aesthetics of the house were not flawed by the required work (due to updated building codes.) He and his team were also very diligent about the PPE inside and out.

I'm very happy with Express Electrical and George and I will recommend them to everyone!< /Review>

I couldn’t be more pleased with him & the repairs he performed.  He was knowledgeable & professional.  He was prepared for just about anything.  So respectful & personable, too.
It was a big job but he was diligent until completed.  Then he even cleaned up & sanitized after himself.
This company has a keeper!< /Text>< pictures>

JR is knowledgeable and has a lot of experience because he explained to me the reasons to refurbish my panel that  caused me to do it, in order to prevent any future hazards and fires. JR got he job done before the time he estimated and he was very kind and sociable which made me feel confident in him being honest and giving me a good price. J.R. offered me several options and did not pressure me into choosing which option I should do by making me think I was gonna be skimping on the work that was necessary to make my home safe. He reassured me that his price and work came with a 30 month warranty if anything goes wrong later. Overall I had a very good experience with Express Electrical and I recommend them to anybody who wants quality work done by a professional. Thanks to Express Electrical and JR I can sleep good knowing that my circuit panel wont be hazardous anymore and more importantly, won't cause a fire.</Text>

Recommendation for work done by George and his team from Express
Electrical Services

Our home electricity system seriously malfunctioned one weekend this
November.  We called several companies from the Yellow Pages and chose Express Electric Services to deal with.  George appeared the next
morning, explained the situation and work began. George knew what to
do and what equipment was needed.  He led his crew of Jesse, Felix,
Hector, and Rene with skill and concern to get top work done.  He was
impressive.  His crew was enthusiastic, showed pride in their work,
and respect for us.  The three required inspections passed with no
problem.  The inspectors commented to us on the especially good work
that had been done.  George was perfection in managing the job and
getting the work done on time.  I was very happy and highly recommend
George for quality of work and his pride in getting a top quality job
done.

< Review>
JR was our electrician and if I could give more stars I would.  The company texted me a picture ahead of time and gave me updates on when the electrician would arrive/if they were running behind from another call.  Very communicative which is super helpful.  JR arrived on time and was so patient going through our financing options and helping us choose the right plan.  After a few different tries for financing we were unfortunately denied.  We thanked him for his time, and he left.  About 2 minutes later he called and said he might have one more option and actually turned around and came back.  It was then night time, but he helped us find a plan that worked.  After approval we were able to get started the next day and it was completed in 2 days! We did a panel upgrade, outlets getting moved around, new lights installed.   Herman came in too and did an incredible job on the drywall. You would never know there was a hole in the wall.  I 100% plan on calling JR for any electrical things in the future and highly recommend this company.</Review>

<Review>I need some emergency work. They say great. I ask the price. They say cant do that on the phone, they NEED to see the job. I cancel all other electrician appointments. They call back on appointment day, quote me a price at $400,  they say that might cover everything. I ask them to help me out, that's alot for an hour of work. They say they can't budge but they'll do me a favor and see if someone can come at the original appointment... What?

I understand the liability of doing electrical work on something I installed myself. However, why not stick to the original plan? See how much time itll take. I also get it's your policy, but why not help me out if you're literally going to price gouge me. Wow, that was a terrible experience.<//Review>< gmapID>

Outlandish pricing bordering on criminal! The GFI in my bathroom blew out. I made an appointment with Express Electrical and found them to be almost suspiciously sweet on the phone; I landed an appointment just a couple of hours later which suited me! The electrician Frank arrived in a professional looking van; Frank’s demeanor was very nice and professional, he found out that nothing was wrong with the power source in the bathroom - it was only the outlet that needed to be replaced. After inspecting my electrical panel and stating that it did not look too bad he came up with some numbers: replacing the electrical panel which was not really necessary as he stated again, would cost $4225; just replacing the GFI outlet would cost $345. Being shocked by the price he explained to me that GFIs are more expensive than regular outlets and that Express Electrical actually gives me the product for free - they just charge for the installation...I googled the price of a GFI at Home Depot: $25! Estimated time to install it: 5 minutes. At that point I would have been comfortable doing it myself as I had observed how Frank pulled the old one out...easy peasy! When I called a real estate/contractor friend for back-up he could not believe how much Frank wanted to charge me and promised to swing by later and put the GFI in for free. Given the costs of operating a business in California I would have grudgingly paid $150 for the service even though in an ideal world $75 would have seemed a fairer price. Wanting to charge $345 is borderline fraudulent: I was rattled by this incident, imagining Frank driving around and taking advantage of other homeowners or renters...! What also gave me pause was the fact that this business has an extremely high rating and many positive customer reviews...?!?! Is there something fraudulent going on with the rating system...?! So people watch out!  Do your research and get as much information on prices and procedures as possible and don’t be afraid to refuse a service!</Text>

Frank, the technician was so professional and straight forward what I needed. I am suffering like everyone else with COVID-19 layoffs and I had to chose a budget. Let me tell you it was worth every cent. Frank cleaned,  explain every process and made sure I understood the issues of my home. I am using Frank the electrician from Express Electrical Services and I will be using the company for my other projects coming up.< /Review>

I can’t say enough about the quality of work this company provides! I had a scary experience with my outlet sparking and smoking. The technician who came was able to figure out the problem, and we came to find that we could have easily had a fire in our house if it hadn’t been fixed. He was extremely knowledgeable and was able to fix the problem and give me and my family peace of mind. Thank you Express Electric! Keep doing an awesome job and having great customer service! 5 stars all the way!!< /text>

They really do provide another level of service. The workers were professional and friendly, especially our technician Carlos, their gear and clothes were well cleaned, and the installation was done neatly and efficiently. They kept us up to date on every step of the process and I felt very well taken care of. Even when the inspector came he commented on a job well done and only had two small issues that needed correcting. I would definitely go directly to them for any of my needs in the future.< /Text>

{'time': 1605534596531, 'text': 'Thank you for your honest feedback about our pricing, Berndt. Unfortunately, some of our greatest assets as a company are also our greatest costs. Our company is committed to putting our customer’s, their family’s, and our employee’s safety before all else. To us, there is nothing more important than that, and it’s a peace of mind that we find our customers are willing to pay a little bit extra for. We understand that’s not for everyone, and there are certainly individuals out there who are willing to go into your home without investing in the proper equipment, training, licensing, insurance or offering warranties to get the job done in the safest way possible. And if we didn’t make that clear at the time of your concern, that’s on us. But here are some of the things that set us apart from them:\n\nWe hold twice weekly safety trainings in our on-site home simulation center. Simulating both electrical emergencies & routine updates in a practice environment furthers or professional’s hands-on experience and consistently primes their ability to handle any electrical challenge with both vigilance & care.\nBefore your electrician arrives, you’ll receive a photo of him and a description so that you know who is coming into your home. We do not use sub-contractors. Our team is our greatest asset.\nOur entire team is not only licensed & background checked and held to the highest standard of professionalism, from uniform checks to random drug tests.\nAs a company we hold both Liability and Workman’s Comp insurance, protecting you and your property. If you have a contractor in your home, you want to be sure their employer has these protections in place, otherwise a shock or a fall could run you bankrupt.\n\nWe back our work with a 3 year warranty, and have been around for 36 years, so you can be sure we’re good for it. We can offer these types of guarantees because we use only the highest quality materials in your home, and work diligently to ensure you’ll never have to call us back for something once we’ve fixed it.\n\nOur trucks are fully stocked and able to complete the vast majority of jobs in 1 trip, so that we’re not wasting your time. After all, time is money, and if you save a few bucks with a handyman who keeps making trips to the hardware store, are you really saving?\nOur team is local and active in our community, volunteering, holding events to feed the homeless, and always giving back. You can not only trust that you have professionals in your home, but good people with high values who are your neighbors, and just want to help.\n\nLastly, we are open 24/7/365. If that’s not convenient enough for your standard call, or emergency… imagine needing a warranty visit on Christmas day, and not being able to get a hold of anyone until the next year.\n\nYour safety is priceless to us and we invest in our ability to ensure that everyday. We are certain this philosophy allows us to offer the most value of any company. Thank you for reaching out and giving us a chance to show you the difference. Hopefully we’ve been able to highlight our best qualities to you, and we’d be honored to help you improve your home electrical anytime in the future. - The Express Electrical Team ⚡'}<//resp>

This is not against the technician who visited, but when we got our quote, we realized that we just wasted $100 since there was no way we were going to pay their outrageous prices. We were quoted $500 by another vendor for the exact same work, but decided not to go with it because the other vendor was rude. not thinking we would be quoted $3000 to install a ceiling fan, have a plug moved, and another one replaced.

I should have known better. I really bad service</review>

Jorge did a fantastic job on what I consider an emergency situation. My refrigerator stopped working and Jorge found that it was a short in the outlet due to two major appliances pulling the same electricity. The electrical outlet wasn't split so it was about to burn completely out and cause some serious damage.

He found that the circuit breaker box was outdated and nonexistent. The circuits were slowly burning out due to the age of the panel. He took his time and made sure that the new circuit panel was done correctly.

I feel safe now knowing that my family and I don't have to worry about the old and outdated circuit panel.

Thanks Jorge for an amazing job done!!!< /Review>

<text>The technician cut what he thought was an inconsequential cord. It turns out the cord was somehow connected to the power source for the garage door. We were forced to plug the garage door cord into an outlet on the far side of the garage, using two extension cords, to get the garage door system to work. We have yet to rearrange this set-up. I do not understand how a trained electrician could be so careless.< /text>< Name>

We met with Nshan Manougian  from the Glendale office to bid on upgrading our light fixtures in our closets and bathroom. Price was very reasonable compared to other electricians that we used in the past. Nshan came with his assistant today 8am promptly ready to start on the job.< /Text>

I’ll be honest with you, I typically do not post unless I truly believe it’s worth it. Unfortunately, my good friend who is an electrician was unavailable but I feel as if I was fortunate enough to meet a gentleman name Wallace. His positive disposition, demeanor, and attitude made me feel comfortable. Not only was he professional, he was courteous and knowledgeable.  I always am a little leery when it comes to a large company services because I believe it’s important to support the local person. However, in the situation, meeting Wallace, definitely made me feel like I got a chance to meet someone that I feel would be a friend.  Congratulations to express electrical services for hiring good quality people. Outstanding work! Thank you!< /Review>

Even though my appointment was reschedule to the next day somehow, nobody was available at the time of my appointment.  However, Carlos who was taking care of a different customer near my house came soon after his job and solved my problem even though it was almost 6pm.  He was very polite, honest, and well-trained nice guy.  I really recommend Carlos Gonzales.  I'm very satisfied with his job !</review>

We need to have more people like Wallace.   He is super duper friendly and professional electrician.  He did a very good job in installing an electrical  sub panel at my house.   Really happy to know him and highly recommend him.  Express Electrical Services should hire more technician like him.  Totally happy and satisfied with his work.   Great person.   Highly recommend Wallace .  I will ask for him every single time .  He is not just a technician .  He is a person .  He is a friend .  Definitely deserved 5 stars .</Review>

<text>I had a great experience with Express Electrical. The website and over-the-phone customer service was very good. Raul was the technician who came out to perform the work. Raul was very professional, knowledgeable and personable. In spite of it being a rainy day, he did not mind doing what was necessary outside to diagnose and fix my issues. Raul was great to work with.

Overall, I can definitely recommend Express Electrical.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>I do have to be up front and say that my issue with Express Electrical is my own fault for agreeing to do service. But I feel like the result of service for the price I paid was a little shady.
I live out of state, but own a rental house in Anaheim. My tennant called and said they had lost power to a whole wall of outlets in kitchen. Express Electric did have a relatively fast response time, but when the tech got there and made his diagnosis he said since the breaker was not tripped "there is a short and I have no power".....well no duh!... thanks for that Sherlock. I was hoping he could find where the short was.
There is 4 regular outlets on that wall and 2 GFCI. So he said that he would find the short and replace any wire in the wall and outlets that are damaged from the short circuit and it would cost me $1000.00.
Me, not being an electrician thought a short would be something in the wall, so I thought this was a great deal.
2 hours after I approved, i called my tennant to ask what progress the tech has made thinking he was still working on it... my tennant replied that the tech was already done and gone. I had received no pictures, diagnosis, or invoice at the time of service. I asked my tennant what the issue was and how response was, " he found a loose wire behind a GFCI. He tightened it up and we had power."
So for me..... I understand I agreed to $1000 for something that could have been some work.... but when it came to light that it was just a freaking loose wire and no wire or equipment needed to be replaced, I would have assumed that Express Electric would have adjusted the price at least a little. But no, I received no notifications until the emailed invoice later that night, charging $1080.... I would have be much happier paying someone $150 per hour and putting all new outlets in....
Then I missed a call 2 days later and got a voicemail about how I liked my service. When I tried to call back, I got someone else, explained my frustration, she said she would let the customer service rep know to call me back.... but I heard nothing.. ever again.
Really Express Electric... be a better company!!!  I have many properties in CA, but you are one company I will not be calling back.

Update: Express Electric contacted me about my frustrations with the services rendered and lack of communication within. They did very well to hear me out and explained their process as a company. I still believe their set pricing to diagnose and repair is steep compared to other companies, but they did find the problem and fixed it in a timely manner.  I paid the price for getting things done quickly and did not have to wait days for an appointment.
Thank you for your prompt response to rectify my power issue and taking the time to contact me.<//Review><Rate>4<//Rate>< name>

Raul Gomezs' service was outstanding. Once I explained my problem of non functioning outlets in my kitchen and outside patio, he responded with input that gave me a feeling of comfort for resolution. After his analysis, he gave me some alternatives to decide on. He was very cordial, professional and knowledgeable. I have a good feel to determine if someone knows what they're talking about and Raul is solid. I was very impressed. I would recommend him to anyone needing electrical services. Have a happy Thanksgiving.</Text>

This is in reference to, Daniel the electrician from Express Electrical Services.  Even though,  the news he gave me was extremely expensive, but inevitable. He delivered it with such professionalism, and kindness. I got a real informative class on circuit breakers, and my old house.  He made an expensive day a trusting day Thank You<//Review>

<Text>Wallace was very prompt and very courteous. Once the problem was diagnosed, I realized it was my own fault and there was nothing electrical to be done. The company was more than fair and I definitely will call Express Home Service next time we have an electrical issue. Such fairness and honesty is a rare treat and I cannot say enough about Wallace.<//Text>< pics>

Very Impressed!!! Wallace Mejia, the licensed electrician, was very knowledgeable, professional, courteous, and meticulous. He was patient with us and our millions of questions and concerns. Wallace assessed our entire home, including the garage, for proper installation of my existing electrical panel and electrical wiring. He unscrewed most, if not all, of our outlets and checked for proper and up to code wiring. He even fixed a couple of minor wiring issues in a couple of our outlets for free. He said, “I wouldn’t feel good leaving knowing I didn’t fix that minor yet hazardous issue.” At the end of the assessment, Wallace tailored 6 different quotes to meet our specific needs. We had many options to choose from. I highly recommend this company in general and Wallace in particular.< /Text>

The technician was very personable and helpful of our needs. Truly a professional technician and you can really see that he was knowledgeable of his craft. He was able to fix the fluctuation problems of our wiring's in the bedroom and bathroom. Overall, he did a great job in fixing it all and he even went above and beyond in checking the mainlines without extra charges. We highly recommend them to everyone.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>This place and the area around it are absolutely amazing. If you are ever headed up towards a Mammoth Lakes area then you must go up to this beautiful scenic area and be prepared to go up over 9500' elevation. The area up here I believe is called little lakes Valley and has some of the most breathtaking lakes you will ever find.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
I spent my childhood camping in rock creek canyon. Iris meadow and French Camp, campgrounds. When my mom was a kid in the 50's she, my uncle, grandma and grandpa camped in East Fork every summer.
My mom's ashes were scattered at the lake in 1999. Now as a dad, I bring my daughter every summer to visit her; and to tell her stories about her grandma, my uncle and my grandparents adventures at Rock Creek. This canyon is the one family tradition which has transcended generations.
My daughter when she was 6 caught her very first fish, from the exact same spot where I caught my very first fish when I was 9.
I suspect there are many families who can tell tales of this place going way back, its really that... powerful, I guess. The canyon, like a container holding our most sacred relics. The stories I share with my daughter at the campfire, every year. In that canyon, I am home. Please take good care of it when you visit. It wasnt so busy 30 years ago when I was a kid.
Please pick up your fishing line, nightcrawler containers and  beer cans. Let the wind through the trees be the loudest noise we hear.
Recognize that this place is very much alive. Know that for some of us who've seen and been through the worst of mankind, the peace found in this place is second to none. For me, it's the only place on earth where I can find what I need to face the things I've lived through. Tread lightly and enjoy.</Review>

Lots of places in Northern California have been discoved en masse, but I think there is a quaint hidden gem vibe to this whole area. If you get to come here, you will have a nice time surely.< /review>< pics>

So beautiful, the trail was easy for hiking. They have 5 lakes around there. Leaving early so you can enjoy all of them. Don't forget to bring a lot of foods and water also mosquito repellent in case you needed. The lakes was amazing<//Text>

Driving up a windy mountain to find a hidden secret it was breathtaking just seeing the pines on the mountain staring down at the crystal blue water from the melting snow at the top creating a small waterfall, fishing camping hiking and biking are all perfect activities for this area. Enjoy! :)< /Review>

Rock Creek is the best place in the whole world. It's my favorite place to go. I go here every year, and every year I love it! Every year we stay at the East Fork campground. It is probably the best campground in Rock Creek, because of the way it is laid out. There is also a bunch of the campsites that have a creekside campground, so it's great!<//Text>

<text>Food that is CONSISTENTLY delicious. It's a family-owned business, it's authentic, it's everything I look for in a business and more. If you're looking for probably the best Jamaican food in San Diego (maybe even SoCal), look no further.</text>< time>

I had the oxtail entree the first time I came here and loved it.  When I found out they served breakfast I had to try the ackee and saltfish.  Let me just tell you it was sooo good and authentic! You can get rice and peas or fried dumpling with it and I opted for the fried dumpling which was amazing!  Comes with cabbage and plantain.  Can't wait to get this again!</Review>

I celebrated my PhD yesterday in this fine place. happy to tell that we enjoyed a fine evening and the restaurant was clearly one of the reasons for that outstanding celebration. The waiters  collaborated in a splendid style, the cooking was great and my guests were very  overjoyed. We shall surely return for more celebrations. thanks very much.<//review>

Out here on vacation and was a fan when we came out here last month so we decided to come back. The young lady taking orders wasn’t paying attention so we had to ask if she was ready for our order. I ordered brown stew chicken and festivals. I was advised once my order was ready that they no longer had festivals but would substitute for dumplings which I was okay with that even though there was a price difference. Got home with my food and my plantains were missing. It’s just not the service I am use to.<//text>

Would be 5 stars if the goat curry didn't have tons of tiny bones in it. Huge choking hazard, especially since it's not clear that there will be bones in the dish.<//review>

<Text>Not a fan. I'm Jamaican raised.... so I know what I'm eating. Never have I ever had red peas and rice.... that was white....and missing peas...I got there at 5:45 and they had lifted all the chairs so I didn't have the option to sit down because we literally waited for him to finishing removing that option before we place the order. On a positive note, he made sure I got my plantain which was what drove out there for, so thanks for that. Also the jerk chicken has fantastic flavor...< /Text>< pics>

More often than not, Some Of the main entree is  Generally never available. And even on designated days, for particular dishes,  at times they are unavailable!!! I find that Problematic, And  inconsistent with the integrity of what's supposedly available on the Menu. That's not only discouraging, But is not the best impression of the business side and daily operations in Addition the younger dark skinned lady, does not present the best face for a customer to see,  She's  not  congenial, Void of smiling, And  Does not  Occasionally value the customer as the priority,  meaning  she's preoccupied with texting on her phone!!< /review>

<Review>I was very disappointed not enough flavor or heat in the curry goat. The plantains were bland also. But I am giving it 2 stars because they had great customer service.< /Review>< UserId.>

The 1st time I got curry chicken it was very good the rice was good and so were the veggies. this time I got Brown stewed chicken and it's way too sweet for me. Maybe its because I don't like sweet food but I expected a more savory flavor the fried dumplings were also sweet. I feel like sugar was added to my whole meal. It's not gross I just dont like it. The rice didnt have much flavor neither did my mac n chees . Then they added sweet plantai . I just want a glass of water after all this sweet food< /Review>< Response>

Nice people working here, unfortunately I expected more in terms of flavor! Needs more heat. The lunch menu is reasonably priced.</Review>

<review>Being from Jamaica I had to check this place out to see if it was really authentic Jamaican food. To my stomachs pleasure the food at Ackee Tree was aboslutely delectable. Every bite brought me back to the island in the best way possible. Amazing customers service and great food makes this place a must go for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Will be back soon!<//review>< Pics>

We got the Brownstew Fish and collard greens. It was a whole fish that was cooked to perfection served with rice and sauteed veg! I enjoyed the homestyle cooking and having food on the bones with all the flavor that imparts to the food.
This is not a place to come when you are in a rush. Relax and enjoy the yummy food.
Also try the hot sauces!!</review>

<text>First time here and I must Say the service was terrible!! The man behind the counter with the small twists was extremely rude the phone order was never placed. He casually said there was a rush and I forgot to place order.

The food here is ridiculously delicious! We had fried fish fillet, jerk chicken, dumplings, plantains, rice and beans, meat pies and collard greens. The flavored were very authentic. The only thing is that the collard greens were much too salty for me. I'll certainly be back!<//review>

<Review>I've never been to Jamaica but I've had enough Jamaican food to know that this isn't entirely authentic. Place is clean, staff friendly, but you won't get "your eye wiped" here.<//Review>< user>

The portions are meant to feed an elementary child. I have a small stomach, and even I was hungry after. The food was dry. As soon as we opened our boxes we were disappointed! NEVER AGAIN!!!< /text>

I asked for a medium fade and got a Mohawk looking hair cut and strands of hair not cut by my ear. No joke. One side looked faded and at work they asked who cut my hair, I said the barber, no specifications. Guess it’s a one time mistake. Price was right but still I want a consistent haircut. Next time I come in, I want a better quality job.<//Text>

Overall Impression is OUTSTANDING!

QUALITY CUTS lives up to its name!

Occasionally, I get a haircut from Lisa and, as always, greatly satisfied with the Excellent Customer Service and affordable, Quality HairCuts.

Eye Candy: Lots of Decor and Design that I find pleasing to the Eyes...If I had a Man-Cave, I would hire her to decorate it...lol

There are some display items/pieces that are a great "Conversation Starter"

If given the choice to choose only one Hair Stylist/Barber Shop, I would definitely   pick QUALITY CUTS for its Affordable price, Excellent Customer Service, Cleanliness, and Great Overall Experience 👍 👌 👏 😀

I Haven't been back since the height of Pandemic but, thankfully, Hair Salons/Barber Shop are finally open again.

Love this place, all of Barbers in here are outstanding. Lisa made my wife change barbers for our 5 boys because she did so great on their hair the first time. We took them to the chop shop in Lancaster before. Ju and Young do a really good job as well with military cuts. Hot towels being used after every cut, Young does a 1 minute shoulder massage after the haircut that literally feels great. Great place to go to.</text>

<Review>They said I didnt have to sign in and I would be next.  Then the Asian woman took someone before me saying that she only used her clippers and didnt give shampoos.
She had a license, I don't get it. Just lazy I guess. Was it because I was disabled, a Woman, or White!< /Review>< Pictures>

My great nephew needed a haircut. We're babysitting him over the weekend so that my nephew and niece can take a break. My niece is particular on how she wants the cut. Did a SUPERB job! He received a lollipop and a toy. Thank you for really keeping to my niece's preference via her text message❣< /Review>

We just visited Quality Cuts for the first time. First impression walking in the door was great, we were greeted warmly by the owner Lisa and she let us know she would be with us shortly (she was with another customer). We were there for a haircut for my son, and she was gentle with him and put him at ease (he's usually good with getting his haircut, just really shy). She took her time, did exactly what we wanted, and we loved the way his cut came out. She offered us free water or soda and of course he got a lollipop at the end. She was a really down to earth person and her salon is clean and decorated nicely. We will definitely be going back!< /Review>

My daughter got her hair cut today by Christal Nuce and she was AMAZING with my daughter. She was so nice and chatted with me the entire time while chatting with my daughter. I will definitely be going back not just for my daughter but for myself.< /review>

Very nice staff and friendly. Had my daughters hair cut, we walked in, they greeted us and took her to cut her hair. Christal was very kind, worked fast, and did a very cute cut on my daughter.</review>

< Review>
DARRIEN took four hours to do nothing to my hair, first she was 25 minutes late, then told me that the Brown would stand out really good against my blonde hair then she forgot to put in the blonde throughout the weave halfway through, on top of that she kept asking the same questions over and over like she never listened to my response in the first place, charged me $95 to have no brown in my hair because it was basically the same color of my blonde hair and my roots are still showing in the front and I have orange splotches throughout the sides. I called and spoke to the owner for my money back, she said I would have to come in and talk to DARRIEN about that, DARRIEN said she could only give me 60 back because she gave me a haircut and styled it. The haircut was very mediocre and the style was rushed in like five minutes because she took so long and  I had to hurry and get home. The owner is fantastic and very knowledgeable and wonderful. I'm writing this review because I am so tired of hairstylists Who don't listen in the first place and or try to cover up their mistakes with some stupid story,  and then overcharge for their bull crap work they did. The three stars are only for the owner and her shop.   I do not recommend getting your hair done by DARRIEN! Obviously the review posted right after mine is someone trying to back up her crappy work. Once again this review is not about the owner, her shop or anybody else who works in the shop it's about my experience and what had happened with who did my hair and how it turned out.<//Review>

The lady was super nice and professional. It was my first time getting my eyebrows done and she was calm and patient with me. With the corona virus situation she only lets one person at a time come in her shop. The service was amazing and my eyebrows look great, I will definitely go again. The price  was fair and reasonable, I would pay more for the service I got.</Review>

<review>The customer service was good. However, the lady damaged my eyebrows. She did not listen to my requests, she simply brushed me off and said "yeah okay, you want thick, don't worry, I know". She cut off too much of my eyebrow, now I have one longer than the other. And she left the other side super choppy. I wouldn't recommend this place!</review><user>116294464682641618804</user><date>1608916156636< /date>< response>

My very first time here, but won't be the last! Everest the owner was so nice and professional, she did an amazing job on my neglected brows! I will definitely return, and spread the word about my new    brow place. Thanks a lot Everest, and I appreciate the brow tip you shared...<//text>

The worst ever gas station. By law you supposed to have public restrooms. You guys need to learn the need of the public arco should pull your business license.
You are not following health and public guidelines.

< Review>
Well established place with a great selection. Great staff. Great hours for the area. The server had good insight of the dishes. She was able to help us to decide what would be the best option for us and our wallet. Even my 9 year old was happy with the food. Can't say that often. Will be returning next late night with a hunger for something different but familiar.< /Review>

My family and I were pleasantly surprised! We have driven past this restaurant for over 5 years. We finally stopped in, the food was very good and our server was very kind. I would definitely recommend this restaurant</text>

We have been coming to this location for years now. We love it here. The food is great and so is the service. I can’t name one time that I ever had to wait for anything here, they are so quick and efficient.. Mario helps us out every time!! He is the best.. but I’m rambling now.. I highly recommend this location :)< /review>

I paid $30 and some change four tacos of cow's tongue at $9.45 for two and one number two plate. When I got home there was only two tacos and number  two plate when I went over there one of kitchen staff went off on me I asked how could you make a mistake on my order these people are trying to rob me charging me for things they didn't give me and then they get mad and start going psycho I will never go back.

<review>Food was okay.  Went around 7pm on a weekday and the place was completely empty.  The waiters were good.  You can tell they try. Lots  of menu options. But I probably wouldn't go back, the atmosphere was a little eerie and the food wasn't that great.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user>105526395679299164671< /user>< name>

<Text>Casa Jimenez is in a great place with always friendly staff.  The food, most importantly, is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. They offer yummy Mexican seafood dishes as well as beef, pork, or chicken entrées.  I have tried many items on the menu and have never been disappointed. You can sit in the large comfy booths or at a table, if you prefer. Casa Jimenez also has a nice selection of beer to choose from and soft drinks as well. Give this restaurant a try, if you love Mexican food. Oh, I almost forgot, they also have an All You Can Eat option for those with really big appetites!< /Text>< Pictures>

I had been going here for over 20 years. I used to love going here until they started treating me strange... I don't know what I did but starting about 2-3 years ago my food started to arrive at my table sloppily arranged on the plate and my micheladas were week and they tasted weird and the glass was never full and they quit giving me that wonderful tajin style rim salt. The worst part is I never used to get sick from this place until they started treating me weird, now whenever I go it's like I have to use the bathroom before I even leave the restaurant. I haven't been there for a couple of years and I don't think I will ever go back! very sad 😥</review>

<Review>I love the chips and Salsa! Had the fajitas it didn't come with the correct amount of tortillas but very tasty. Under staffed for sure but not a very busy location.

I have not been to a Casa Jimenez in a while. I was out with friends and family. We craved Mexican food so we stopped here in Hemet. My friends and family were from Adelanto so I didn't want to disappoint. We enjoyed every bite! Delicious just like I remember. We also had a few beers (Corona), and they were ice cold as was the soda. We almost didn't stop. Their sign was being fixed, which we didn't know, giving us the impression they were out of business. I'm glad we stopped finding out they were still open! Beef tacos, chicken chimichanga, cheese enchiladas, chili relleno, and more were all very good. This really fixed our craving for Mexican food! Prices have come up since I last visited but still well worth it. I will still be a loyal customer for years to come. I can't say enough about the staff. Attentive, courteous, prompt, and more than one person took care of our table. I hope they stay open for many years to come!< /text>

Waitresses are beyond rude. They were loud and laughing and never came to check on us. The food quality went way down. Tasteless, bland, and greasy. Needed to ask for lemon so I could add flavor to it but waitresses were too busy talking. Won't be coming back.< /text>

The people there are real. Translation: They're interpersonal.

I ordered a carnitas taco & pollo taco. Pork was bland, slightly overcooked. Kinda wonder if they just reheated it. Chicken taco was ok. Doused both tacos in salsa to give them some kick. Presentation of the tacos was beautiful though, & they were both still hot when I got them. They also came with chips...also warm & sooo good! Tasted like they were freshly made. Funny, I actually enjoyed the chips more than the tacos. I may try this place again...but won't be ordering tacos if I do.< /text>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Total let down. I've been to this Casa Jimenez many times, along with other locations; and this is the first time I've been this disappointed in the food and service. First off, we come here for the all you can eat. Turns out they only do the all you can eat between 1p and 6p. Completely different than other chains. Then trying to read their menu was not easy. Most of the stuff is in Spanish with English translations, which is fine, but it was like one big run on sentence. And between the background color, the font color, and the glare from the lighting it was simply hard to read. My husband ordered the chili Colorado and it was strange. It had a sweet thin sauce, almost like a sweet marinara sauce; instead of the normal thick chili or enchilada sauce that it normally comes with. We've been to this restuarant a few times over the course of the last few years, and were regulars many, many years ago... and this experience was the worst. I'll continue to go to the Perris and Rubidoux locations, but mostly likely won't be back to this location any time in the near or distantly near future.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The chips were excellent,  the red salsa, not at all.  Watery, lack of flavor.  Green salsa, really good.

Ordered the combo plate, chicken taco, chile rellano,  cheese enchilada rice and beans.

The chicken taco was so over cooked that the shredded chicken was dark brown and hard like beef jerky.  The shell was tough, and overall lacked any flavor.

The cheeses enchilada was a soggy mess.

Chile rellano was full of flavor, it's a shame the center was ice cold.

Rice was soggy, too much water during cooking process.  Beans were good, hot and full of flavor, hard to mess up beans.

Wife ordered the same meal and food was exactly the same as mine.

When 3/4s of the food is left on the plate and both people do not ask for to go containers, that should be a huge red flag.

Server didnt ask us about the food.

I've been going here off and on for over 10 years, tried to give them one more chance, I'm done.

Like a dying relationship you try and hope they get better, but in a town known for below average food, a slightly less than average restaurant can seem to be a culinary oasis, when in reality, it's just another slightly below average eatery in below average food town.<//Text>

<Review>Food wasn't horrible, nothing to brag about but what made it worse was the service. The waitress spilled hot coffee on my baby and instead of apologizing or helping clean the girl just ran away. We had to take a rag from the bus boy to clean my son and it was obvious no one was coming out to take responsibility. If you go with family be very careful cuz it's obvious the staff there are not.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80db6f56ff42c4cf:0xc9c7833d5d4d755<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I came here in hopes the food would be good but it wasn't as expected. I ordered their chimichanga plate and they tried handing me a taquito plate. I have no idea how they miss heard that order...but anyways, the food was bland. And their Queso fundido was very dissapointing!! It was just a big blob of cheese with hardly any chorizo and they expected 4 people to enjoy that appetizer with 2 measly flour tortillas and all at the cost of $8.25!!! Will not reccomend this place to anyone! Better off eating at Cardenas market.< /text>

The mexican food that I have had in this sit down restaurant is as good as any of it's type that I have had anywhere in Riverside county and I prefer it over any of it's type in the city of Hemet.  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys mexican food.< /Text>

Soooooo sub par. The food looked and tasted like there was no effort put into it. We were the only ones in there and they acted like we were interupting theyre conversation they were having loud and angry and in spanish 5 feet from us and couldnt even have our own convo. Then they charged us $40 for a chimichanga and an order of nachos and charged us more for the juice we drank than i would have payed for an imported beer. Can we say racist? Ive gone in w my mexican buddies and was treated right.</Review>

They also sang to him and they gave him a dessert. Thank you very much for helping me to make the important day in which my wife was born on a special day.

<text>(Translated by Google) The street tacos have no meat, they are pure onion and coriander I do not recommend the shrimp cocktail very good, nor do they say anything to the waitress or owner Mirella Jimenez because instead of asking for an apology because the tacos do not have meat, she puts Defend her.
