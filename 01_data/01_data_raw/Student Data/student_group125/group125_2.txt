< review>
Amazing LITTLE place. A perfect example of a wonderful "hole in the wall" restaurant!! The staff was very cheery and eager to help and suggest items. The food came in HUGE portions!!! And was definitely under priced. The seating was limited to about 6 tables as it was raining outside. But they accommodated everyone and it was a pleasure eating there. Will most definitely go back!!!</review>

The burgers were exceptionally good.  The fries were perfect and with very good  blend of spice and flavor.  I recommend anyone to get the food and go to the coast, nothing better in the area.<//review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3mVbcNfSYDznr4XTXh7ZyRjnc74PQCfmQMyZR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrosHs0B47eFIjUzeddMn4MIoYQU0yM4FiDdSU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808421e1c59f204b:0x3147af68e205ff0f<//gmapID></record>

My only “beef” with this place is I wish they were open longer. Good breakfast with large portions and some of the best BBQ around. Seating is limited but worth any wait.< /Text>

<Text>Perfect for breakfast! The place is a 5 star for sure! Don’t understand those who say it was great and compliment it then give it less than 5 stars... Ha. Organic, delicious coffee, breakfast cooked excellently (scrambled eggs, crispy hashbrowns, fluffy pancake with maple syrup, and applewood bacon) YUM! Homemade salsa in the scramble was a good move too :) Went in winter, but even the patio had heat lamps and was great. Small dining area for seating inside and cozy. Wonderful service from the welcoming and positive Judy!!</Text>< time>

A word to the wise: if you are going there for breakfast, get there early because the place gets slammed! The friendly wait staff will keep you supplied with coffee while you enjoy the sun streaming through the Redwoods.

<text>Very nice! The food was great today for the three of us. Oops I left out my friends Golden Retriever I guess that's four. Also Dog friendly on the beautiful partially covered  perminant outdoor dining area that also has umbrellas to cover the rest. Great idea, giving   patrons a choice of Sun or shade.  The restroom was perfectly clean. The decor inside and outside is excellent. The staff is superb. Can't go wrong with this choice.<//text>< pics>

I've been coming here for about 10 years. The food is quality fresh food. They are usually pretty busy, however it's worth the wait. The owners are delightful. This is my most favorite restaurant in Sonoma County. I can't wait until they open back up for dinner. The waitresses are nice too...< /text>

<text>Every drive towards Guerneville or camping trip nearby my husband and I make the Garden Grill a must stop destination to eat. we enjoy the great service and many fresh menu choices. The garden patio is clean and offers shade or sun or dog friendly seating among lots of blooming plants to add to their ambiance. This is “my spot” to quickly unwind after a drive over from Grass Valley. There are times we even drive a bit out of the way 😉 to enjoy the BEST - tasty - fall off the bone pork ribs I have Ever eaten. Out of my 50 years of world wide dining “this is MY favorite place” to casually eat fresh food, fill my tummy and have friendly service. The fresh deserts (carrot cake and giant layered chocolate cake) are hard to pass up.< /text>< pictures>

Right near the Russian River. Attractive patio area. The mushroom burgers and sweet potato fries are my favorite. Minimal parking out front, go down the drive and find more. Staff is friendly. Minimal seating inside. A treat to go there.< /Review>

Fabulous outdoor seating, pretty flowers, hummingbirds. Food was great, dessert was great, prices even better. I had 1/2 rack ribs with beans and fries.Go here you won't be disappointed. Waitress needs to slow down just a bit. We also went back for lunch and breakfast, I had mushroom and Swiss char burger with garlic parmesan fries, the man had omelette with meat and all veggies. You will like everything on the menu. Go here!< /Text>

We wanted a more casual evening as part of a recent trip to Guernville and this placed seemed to fit the bill.  Both my wife and I had BBQ, me the pulled pork sandwich and she just had the pork plate (same basic concept, but since she's gluten free, it skips the bun).  We sat in the outside dining area, which, with the heaters on, was just about perfect (other than a little road noise).  They had some decent beers (in bottles) and the BBQ was well done.  My wife really enjoyed the sweet potato fries.  Pleasant dinner at a very reasonable price, with solid service.< /text>

We ordered fries and than found out that thay can't be served - no substitutes were offered. We ordered garlic bread - never got it, although we asked for it twice. They promised to turn the hitter on, but left us in the cold. Yes the salads weren't very bad, but still - Never again!!</text>< Pics>

Lovely garden setting however service not friendly or attentive. The fish of the fish and chips was barely edible, rock hard and barely able to cut with a knife.  One in our party did enjoy the0 hamburger.</Text>

Usually would give them 5 as their food is always good but last Sunday we were waiting outside the front door and they failed to let us know when our table was ready then another 20 min to get drinks on the table. Time from arrival to food... 1hr 30 min. For a 20 min wait quote.</review>

<Text>I heard of this place by ear. It is quit cozy. They serve Taylor Maid coffee which made me sit. I love a nice cup of coffee with my breakfast. Rarely, do I ever encounter good food, AND good coffee. We order our food to which the waitress repeated correctly. I may add they were busy; one of our extra request was not fullfilled. We asked for a plate to go. When our food came, it was ok. My bacon and potatoes were cold. Eggs were perfect. I liked the spicey Bloody Mary.  I would have LOVED it with less horse raddish. (My bartending teacher said," You can make enemies if you add too much horse raddish.") I am particular with my food, and I look forward to each meal, but I will never be too harsh if I'm disappointed. However, I decided to point out an obvious harsh mistake, it could be just an eyesore. I noticed the waitress making up a few drinks for the table next to ours. I wanted to see how they fixed their drinks. I did not expect genuine ingredients to go in the drinks.  I couldn't dismiss the tray of drinks were placed on top of the garbage can. I don't care how clean the can could be, I just think this was a bad mistake. I am grateful for a nice meal I don't have to cook. This is a reminder to the staff to always follow the food and safety handlers' rules.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Asked for a table for 12 and waited in the back as they suggested, but they never came out to get us. We waited for at least 30 minutes when they said 15-20. When we went in to ask the lady said we never came in to check and weren't able to get us a table for 12!! What a waste of time. We decided to stay and managed to move tables together on our own. Overall the service was OK but didn't get our food at the same time though we ordered at the same time. The food is average, you could really go to any diner. I don't recommend the turkey sandwich, not very flavorful.< /Text>< Pictures>

< review>
This has always been one of my most favorite restaurants in the guerneville area.
I had lunch there today and was not only disappointed with the service,  but with my meal as well.
I always get a side salad and on occasion have been less than happy when some of the lettuce is slimy or wilted beyond what it should be.
Today was much worse when I noticed my turkey sandwich did not taste as great as I remembered.
I was almost finished with half of the sandwich when the waitress brought out the applewood bacon which should have been on the sandwich, but was now a side dish because the cook forgot to put it on the sandwich. Then I also realized that the cranberry dressing was also missing from the dish.

Garden Grill has always been an awesome place to eat…now it will be sometime before I go back or recommend it to friends when they come to town.<//review>

Absolutely impressed with their service and professionalism. I got a flat tire on my way to a work appointment and they arrived so fast. The driver  Mike Digiusepe was so attentive and kept reassuring me and was very mindful at all times of my safety. My spare tire was low on air, so he rushed to the nearest gas station and had it filled, then he checked it to make sure it had no leaks.  I made it to my appointment safely and only 10 minutes late.   Very grateful. Thank you.</review>

<Text>This place is not a body shop...  It's a towing company pretending to be a body shop. Do not bring your car to this place. They will ruin it.  Mismatched paint, lies, and unprofessional behavior.. They literally have a 23 year old kid running the place.  If you want to trust your car to a kid... by all means take your car there.< /Text></record>

< Review>
Came in with my sister. Sadly to say the car will not b coming home with us.. The lady who helped us showed us the car and told us about fees. She was nice and answered all our questions. There was the towing guy who ended up picking up the car and was amazed on how my sister survived the car  accident. He explained how he found the car. I do not know how much were fees or per night the car was there. The staff seem friendly.</Review>

Michael B. was friendly and helpful. He didn't try to sell us anything we didn't need. He was patient and explained the problem to us in detail.</Text>

Not only that but the manager "Willie" accidentally let me know that they out source their work... They dont actually do all of their work there. Paint didnt match original.

< review>
They are very friendly and their tow truck driver Mike was so friendly and helpful.  When he arrived he actually got my car started for me so there was no need to tow me but to make sure I didn't break down on my way home he followed me till I reached my destination safely. Above and beyond what was expected!!! I would most definitely use them again in a heartbeat.. Thank you Mike!! You are the best and you made me feel very safe😃👍<//review>

< review>
Driver Nathan Brown had help me a few years back, When AAA who uses Golden touch towing for the area I’m located in sent him out on a roadside call to assist me, Nathan remembered me the car and my previous issue. Nathan not only assisted me with my current problem that day but even went out of his way to make a phone call to a mechanic he knows to answer another question I had about another car I’ve had an issue with. Thank you Nathan for your unparalleled service.</review>

He was very professional and taught me a little about how batteries work and are installed. He went above and beyond by taking out the tray and washing it before he installed the new battery. Angel takes pride in his work and it really shows. Thank you Angel.<//text>< pics>

Great customer service, always greeted with a smile. Went to several body shops for an estimate, and they were the only ones who gave me a detailed receipt and they definitely were the most efficient. Replaced both doors and matched the paint perfectly— even detailed and washed my car. Worth every penny, highly recommend!<//text>

Fantastic job on my Jaguar about 5 years ago. I was worried paint wouldn't  match  and would be able to tell where it was hit. They did such a good job and they detailed my car and polished it after. I was very happy.  Which is rare :)< /text>

<Rate>2</Rate><username>Sharon Green< /username><Review>I dealt with Fred. He was quick about picking up my car to get the business but was slow about completing the job.  He lied on the insurance company saying he was waiting on approval that had already been approved. He told me his mother died, then she was in intensive care,  then died again.  I was sympathetic to his issues and gave him a couple months to get back to me. He also put my emblem on crooked and spilled the adhesive used on to my car and promised to correct it but never did. He stopped responding to texts and calls. Poor business practices.<//Review></record>

Not too impressed. For insurance repairs, i would recommend buena park mercedes. Their collision repair department will work on all cars. Took my Honda to golden touch and my truck to mercedes benz of buena park for similar body repairs and you can tell the difference in the craftsmanship. Primer started cracking on the honda in less than 3 months and slight waves in the body, they shouldve block sanded more and let the primer cure longer. Wouldnt go back</text>

<Text>I was stranded at my son's high school and it was a hot day.  Some hoses under the hood busted and my car blew up in steam.  The tow truck driver "Gabriel" was very respectful to me and put the hoses back together again.  He followed me to the nearest gas station to fill my reservoir w water so I can get home safely.  I called my mechanic at a later time.  I just want to thank you for your excellence in customer service and for going the extra mile for a helpless lady like me.  Thanks a million.  lc</Text>< Pics>

Definitely will NOT recommend this shop for anything. They overcharged for everything and will nickel and dime you. You can tell these people are totally dishonest because they show you one price and there are bunch of wrong items and when they went back to fixed them, they added a bunch more new fees in the hope you won't notice.  So from my experience, this is a typical shady shop and it's no wonder they don't have that much business.</Text>

< review>
I’ve lived in a few different states and Dr. Duenas is my favorite chiropractor I’ve seen throughout the years. He cares about his patients and is willing to go the extra mile to teach people how they can help themselves. If you get the chance, take one of his trigger point classes, where you can really learn to care for your body and resolve some issues on your own. I used to go for adjustments much more regularly, but I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t need to go as frequently.

His staff is incredible, and I highly recommend Cynthia if you are in need of a massage. She knows all the tricks to help relieve pain and release problem areas, not to mention she’s just the sweetest.<//review>

<text>I started coming here when I was about 20 weeks pregnant because I started having lower back pain. I’m so thankful I found Performance Chiroptactic because Dr. Duenas provided me with so much relief! He does great adjustment and also teaches you what’s going on in the body and things you can do at home. It’s obvious he loves his job and truly cares about his patients. The massage therapist, Cynthia, is amazing! She did several prenatal massages during my pregnancy. They helped so much.<//text>< Pictures>

I was in constant pain for over 2 weeks and would wake up in tears every night. The pain and ache I felt on my shoulder, neck and back was radiating down to my elbow. I was unable to use my left arm or move my neck. I came to Dr. Duenas and he recommended Fascial treatment. During my treatment he explained everything in great detail and made sure I was doing okay throughout the treatment. After the treatment I felt instant relief and was able to move my neck. As the days went by I felt great, it was like I was never in pain. Here I am a few weeks later and I haven't had any pain or aches come back nor linger. Fascial treatment is the best treatment I have received and I truly recommend it. Dr. Duenas is the Best Chiropractor I have been seen and his office staff Cynthia is always very pleasant and helpful. I highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to anyone looking for a Chiropractor.< /Text>

I have been going to see Erin Hamon for almost 2 years now to receive my monthly massages.  I can honestly say that going to see her monthly has significantly impacted my life for the better.  My headaches have decreased and I feel overall better.  She is friendly, courteous, professional, respectful, and gives the best massages ever!!  I highly recommend going to see Erin for a massage!!!<//Review>

<review>Erin, Cynthia and The Doc (Dr. Duenas) are hands down A+MAZING! As soon as you walk in they are inviting and greet you by name. The staff is very knowledgeable and provide self-care options for everyday care & most importantly very professional. I wouldn't go or recommend anywhere else in the AV for Chiropractic Care. #goteamPerformanceChiropractic<//review>< user_name>

We love Dr D. He has been very patient with me and all my questions. He goes above and beyond to help you find the issues and understand how to take care of them. He is more than just a chiropractor. My kids are on the very affordable kids plan and love him. Jessica does my massages and she's great. It's amazing the strength that comes out of such a sweet and petite person. I've been to several chiropractors that have been good but this one has been a great fit for our family. Check them out!!!! You'd be amazed at how much your spine controls your health.< /text>

I have been a patient of Dr. D's for seven years or maybe even longer. I followed him through multiple offices. He has very personal care for his patients. He uses different techniques and approaches depending on exactly what is wrong. The office staff is great. Jessica is very personable, she is just wonderful. Great customer service. Jessica remembers you and you can pick up the same conversation from where you left off from your previous discussions. Really great experience.</Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Dr Rick was recommended by my therapyst. I had issues with my spine and my elbows.

Dr. Rick discovered I had other issues besides the normal adjustments and recommended I see an orthopaedist. His diagnosis was correct. He could have just continued with the adjustments but my well being was his concern not his pockets. I am happy to say that I no longer have any issues with my elbows and he has rid me of back pain. I can now golf and exercise without discomfort.

His staff is courteous, facility is immaculate, and his concerns are for his patients health.
His professionalism reflects credit upon his self and his establishment. I have recommended him to all my friends and will continue this practice in the future.

My thanks to Dr. Rick, Jessica and Staff!!!

<text>I scheduled 3 full body massages on 07/25/2015 with Cynthia for myself and 2 other friends. We were very pleased with her promptness, her professionalism and her attention to detail. She asks you about the pressure throughout the massage to assure the pressure is sufficient. I will be back. Thank you Cynthia.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I've been going to Dr D on and off for close to 5 years now and I can honestly say that he takes the time to listen to my concerns and thoroughly educates me on why I have pain, how it gets aggravated, and what I can do to alleviate it. I never feel as if I am getting the same treatment as anyone else. Today, I did the foam rolling class to learn how to relieve my own trigger points. It hurts so good!! I walk out feeling refreshed. I always highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to all of my friends and family.<//text>

I wish I would have listened to my coach and came in a lot sooner. I have been here twice to get worked on and will continue to do so. I am in and out in a timely manner, the staff especially Jessica are friendly and welcoming, and answer questions efficiently. Dr Rick Dueñas explained everything in a way that was easy for me to understand. He spent time with me during my initial consultation, and they were able to see me the same day to get worked on. I feel 10xs better since going in for my adjustments.<//Review>

<text>I have been seeing Jessica the Licensed Massage Therapist at Performance Chiropractic for the past several months. I have a very physical job and had been experiencing quite a bit of soreness and pain in my legs and back, she has helped me immensely. I always walk out of the office feeling 100x better than when I walked in. I know that the sport massages have helped me to prevent any injuries and to succeed at my job. I would strongly recommend Jessica to anyone.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Jenny is my favorite Masseuse! She finds knots I didn't know I had so when I leave I feel so much relief. I carry my stress in my neck and shoulders and I leave feeling so relaxed and ready to take on the world. Jenny listens to what I want/need and does exactly that. When I tell her it hurts, she keeps at it, knowing that I need it and when I tell her it's too much she backs off a bit. Always get my money's worth with Jenny. Thank you soooooo much!</Review>< Pics>

< review>
Great chiropractor and staff. Jessica and Dr. Duenas have both helped me gain less painful movement in my upper body and lower back. I have had multiple surgeries in my lungs and the muscle damage had led to severe pain. Slowly, but surely I am regaining my strength and endurance. I would highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to anyone ready for quality care. I look for a calm, caring, and efficient environment in any of my medical care, they definitely deliver. Thank you Dr. Duenas and Jessica. I always look forward to my visits.<//review>

< Review>
I was referred to Dr. Duenas after an accident, I had really bad back pain and honestly thought I was going to have to live like this forever. I felt very welcome from day one in his office. He has the best staff!! They were very friendly and I received nothing but the BEST service and treatment!!! They have definitely helped me so much, my pain has been minimized and I will definitely be back for monthly adjustments, I wouldn't go anywhere else! They made me feel like family, and I will be referring my friends and family to this office! Thank you Dr. Duenas and Jessica for helping me out! You guys are awesome!!</Review>

Excellence at its best!
I have been seeing Dr. Duenas for over a year now and am extremely pleased with his expertise as well as the staff! They are always welcoming and provide excellent service, not too mention i always leave their office feeling 100% better than when i came in. I used to visit his office twice a week to relieve my pain and now i only go 1 time a week and/or as needed. I also have taken his foam rolling class to help work out my pain at home which has made a tremendous difference in my pain levels! They have massages, which are very reasonably priced and are better than at a day spa in my opinion. I would (and have) highly recommend Performance Chiropractic to anyone needing pain relief! Thanks Dr. Duenas and staff, you guys are the best!</text><rating>5<//rating><GmapID>0x80c25a59e7c45a7d:0x14d73f533cbf1d06</GmapID><resp>None<//resp>< user>

I've been going to Dr. Duenes for about 5 years.  I have been in a couple car accidents where I've injured my neck,  and chiropractic care is the only thing that helps!  Dr. D is very personable, and knowledgeable.< /review>

You are in *very* good hands with "Dr. D" and Jessica. I go in with a cane to walk, and leave without needing it. I love the heat and the roller table. He accommodates whatever disabilities I may have that day and adjusts without hurting me.

Dr Duenas:  Great skill, explains well, experience, prompt--doesn't make me wait forever to see me either when I am needing an appointment or in the office, helpful in any way he can, generous, professional, warm hands (freezing hands I've had, and that's not helpful when you need an adjustment), and humorous.

Jessica:  Cheery personality, fun, remembers my name/background, great conversationalist, EXCELLENT massage therapist!, funny, thorough, professional, perceptive, down-to-earth, generous, heart-centered, thoughtful, did I say EXCELLENT massage therapist? oh yes, she's the best...lol.

I've had back issues since 1991. I've seen a dozen chiropractors all over (CA, Alaska, Virginia). Some have helped, some have hurt, some have REALLY hurt! Dr. Duenas is the FIRST and only to stretch and massage my neck after an adjustment so I didn't have a throbbing headache when I leave. That's huge. I've never let anyone do my neck because of how it feels torqued and hurts afterward--except him.

I always look forward to going in to see them. I've known them since 2010. They make a great professional team and I am so happy to see their success and growth.<//review>

I strongly recommend Dr. Dueñas.   I started my chiropractic care with him 4 months ago since I could barely walk because of my lower back problems.  I was limited in what I was able to do.  Most importantly I was unable to play with my nieces and nephews without any pain.  Since I started going to Dr. Dueñas I immediately felt very comfortable and started getting educated in how I can help myself and my body.  He is very understanding and caring for his patients.  He has amazing staff that will always make you feel at home.  Driving from San Fernando every week was not an issue since I knew he was helping me be pain free.  Not only do I feel 100 times better from my back but I also became and exercise addict.  I'm able to do my normal activities with no pain and most importantly no medication.  I will always recommend Dr. Dueñas to all my friends.</Review>

This review is for the ballet clases for kids. Ballet classes are virtual and/or in person. At this moment, make ups are only virtual. Classes are also recorded and you get a link with the video that your kid can use to practice. Face masks are no longer required. Sanitizer and water dispensers are available for the students. This place has also free coffee for parents while waiting for their kids. Drop off is also available. Teresa, the ballet instructor was awesome, very nice with the kids, always smiling, kind and caring. My son loved to go to his ballet classes. Front desk girls were always super nice as well. I am giving 4 stars to this place only because of the $40 registration fee that you have to pay (on top of the class rate) if you withdraw the class and want to come back again to class.</review>

Mrs Theresa is kind patient and attentive to my daughter. We have been working with her for over a year now and are very pleased with our daughters progress. We thank you Mrs Theresa and the whole team for creating such an enriching environment for our young performers to thrive and be their best. Would definitely recommend to family and friends.</Text>

My little girl takes Violin, piano, and vocal classes. She absolutely adores all of her teachers and the classes she's in. I personally feel that they have an amazing variety of classes and teachers that work very well with children. The staff knows very well what classes each child will fit into and adapt to the best.</text>

My 4-year old daughter Lily and I have had a great experience thus far. On the days that we arrive to class early, we enjoy reading the children's books on your coffee table, especially the one that explains the meaning of an "orchestra," "symphony," and other musical terms (the book with the mice). I think the batteries need to be replaced, though, for the full-sound effect. Reading that book to her has become part of the musical experience for us at your facility and has inspired us to go see a show with an orchestra. Lily enjoys her piano class very much. My perception is that she generally leaves the class feeling inspired to continue playing. I've also witnessed a bounce in her step as we leave the school, exuding confidence and self-esteem. I feel so happy when I see that. But, my challenge is not getting enough practice time at home in between sessions. We are working on a plan to fix that. Lily has had just one complaint: she doesn't like the smell of the air freshener in the restroom. Lol. :-)<//text>

Excellent school that is very conducive to learning. There are so many amazing teachers and flexible schedule options. I've noticed improvement and discipline in only a few lessons. Highly recommended.<//text>

Our Grand Daughter loves Westminster Arts academy, and so do her parents and grandparents. All of her teachers are very competent, caring, friendly and encouraging. The school is extremely organized and uses a system of achievement and awards when their students reach new levels of expertise. The school has several student recitals and performances yearly for the local community and extended care facilities for the elderly.  I highly recommend the Westminster Arts Academy!<//Text>

My daughter has been attending Westminster Arts Academy for a while now and she loves it. All the instructors are very patient and know exactly what their doing. This might sound familiar, but I seriously do recommend anyone who is trying to find the perfect music school for their kiddos or even themselves.. just give it a try and you will see how family friendly and perfect this school is. Thanks Westminster Arts Academy for teaching Sammy and giving her the love for music...< /Review>

<Text>My girls love coming here weekly. One takes private piano lessons and the other takes dance class. The instructors are awesome, all of them!

It is family owned and they are all soo helpful and sweet. The prices are affordable and totally worth it.

YES YES YES I RECOMMEND !!! Go sign up your kids, you won’t regret it! :)<//Text><Name>Lynn Ho</Name>< gmapID>

<text>My three daughters have been taking lessons here for four years. They have advanced skillfully as musicians, have also personally grown as the arts are vital to a well rounded education.  I am grateful that there is such an academy — and the Rios family, the proprietors, are salt of the earth people with a genuine passion for the mission their father started.  Wish I could give them 10 stars!<//text>< Pics>

I love taking classes here and this academy because they have really great teachers that help you so much.  It only took me about 3 months to be a scholar here. And I only take classes on fridays. Even if you request a song that’s hard they help out plenty. They made my life so complete with music, and without it I wouldn’t know how to touch the keys. But now I am at the high score level. Thanks to Westminster Arts Academy. I also like how much they teach even more than just piano because they teach ballet, art classes, guitar, drums, ukulele, violin, and more. I remember the first day I started I was confused and he next week I came back I was knowing all my stuff. This five star goes to the greatest of all Westminster Arts Academy! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//text>

My theee children have been taking piano and clarinet lessons here for 6 months and we have been extremely satisified with our experience here.  The children are excelling in their music thanks to the great teachers and support staff.  The teachers are meticulous yet easygoing in their instruction so that the kids can easily relate.  The musical ladder system that the staff implemented helps motivate the students with continuing achievements.  The administrative staff are also continuing to innovate by introducing the ability to track lessons at home.  My family is so glad we have found this place and our children are always looking forward to their next lessons.  We highly recommend Westminster Arts Academy!<//text>< GmapID>

Both the instructor and the school are very flexible in term of make up and the kid really like the instructor. The schedule is part of my kid's Marching Band. She has to perform when the school has football games, practice for the performance both for the games and competitions with other school Marching Bands.</text>

WORST experience ever! This review is permanent and I will explain why. Upon initial call was told that the 2011 BMW 328i battery that i needed was $65 used and $130 new. Good price right? Not really! I asked if they were official BMW batteries was told yes, but when i bought the used one it did not have the handles on top like my original battery but no stickers(needed to know cold cranking power) , so i went ahead and got it, I just need one that works. When i put it in, not so easy to do, but anyway found out it was way smaller than my original . So immediately wrote a negitve review, s & n replied here and so to offer a fair chance i called them and they said they would gladly exchange for the correct size BUT when i started the car noticed my audio speakers were making a weird buzzing and thumping sound. Then before even making it to s & n the car turned off and would not start again and had to get a tow! Was so upset i was towed home and didnt even want to think about the issue until i calmed down. So couple of weeks ago decided to get one from local auto parts store and bought the correct battery (to my surprise was new $110! Attached a photo of receipt )  and all these problems are now gone and so is s & n, didnt even return to s & n for a battery replacement or exchange because i was totally disgusted with that place!< /Text>

I was referred to this company by a friend. After learning this company has been in business for 5 years, I'm wondering why I haven't heard of them sooner!! Very friendly and professional. Great attitude. I will definitely recommend this company to my family and friends.< /review>

The battery in wife's car died.  The place I'd used in the past didn't have the battery in stock and couldn't get it for four days.  I found S&N online and went there.  Saul was friendly, installed a quality battery in just a few minutes, and charged a price significantly less than I'd seen for comparable batteries on auto parts store websites.</Text>

Normally don't leave reviews, but my experience here was great. He did a free check of my battery and alternator and cleaned the contacts to the battery. Honest, friendly, and knowledgeable. Definitely recommend.</Text>

Fabulous! Great prices and they deliver locally free and charged only $10 for 40 miles away...They guys also installed it and checked my alternator as well! Super friendly and helpful staff...will use again for all my battery needs! Battery well exceeded my expectations for price! Also came with warranty!<//Text>

The worker was super-nice! He cleaned my battery cables because they had gunk on it. He notified me about the rating which gave me a discount off top. He talked to me about the reconditioned batteries. The reconditioned versus the new batteries. Very explanatory, sounded like there were no hidden fees...seemed like a really great place!</Text>

These guys did me right not only once but twice. Had a prob. with the first battery i purchased and they fixed without question giving me another one AND........extended the warrenty by double the original warranty due to my first issue. Highly recommended if you need a quick used battery.< /Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Went and bought a battery for my son and prior to I had called to get a price on a used battery and to make sure it was in stock. After confirmation of it being in stock and the affordable great pricing I went to pick it up. When I got there the owner who I spoke to was very Friendly, professional and had great customer relations communication. Not only did I get the battery I needed it, I ended up receiving a brand new battery instead of the used one but for the price of the used one. And the reason for this was because I had been given the incorrect information prior to me arriving about having a used battery in stock. Most companies won't honor that they'll just apologize for the inconvenience and send u on ur way. But not this store. So thank you S & N and the battery works great.</text></record></dataset><record>

Sad to see people give this great doctor 1 star because they are being political. Never even been to his office yet writes a review... Please leave politics out of it. All doctors have the right to their opinion. Reviews should be taken down if you haven’t actually been to his office.  Shame on you.<//Review>

< Review>
Covid is like measles epidemic in many ways (lower R0 but possibly higher mortality rate). Now we get the entire world possibly infected all at once since no one has had it before. The fog of pandemic is thick its hard to know which path is best. The oath says do no harm. It does not say do an acceptable amount of harm. If you want to tell people to go back to school on air be very specific of how this can be done with no harm. And be considerate of those not fortunate enough to be in the great health club because they are your patients and your livelihood. Basically have a plan not an opinion.< /Review>

<Text>I’d recommend googling “Jeffrey Barke” before seeing him.  In fact, google “Jeff Barke pulls gun out during COVID interview”.

Jeffrey Barke is boastful in claiming that he is affiliated with Hoag Hospital, Orange County’s number one hospital, but Hoag has publicly affirmed that they have no affiliation with him, and are deeply disturbed that anyone would associate him or his views with Hoag Hospital. Of course, Jeffrey Barke wants to be affiliated with Hoag, but they want nothing to do with him, and in fact Hoag is suing him as I type this review (reference Orange County, CA Superior Court Case 30-2020-01159781, Hoag vs. Barke)

Jeffrey Barke is more akin to a self-promoting grifter than a medical professional. I believe Jeffrey Barke’s failed medical practice has led him to capitalize on a certain populous that is often ignorant (intentionally or unintentionally) to consensus-based science. It’s like going to a dentist because the doctor says flossing and brushing is not necessary and may even harm your gums and teeth if done improperly. Because of this dentist's contrarian and unscientific view, he/she does not advise his patients to brush or floss, and in fact does not allow brushing and flossing in his/her office. You know it’s a dumb idea to go there.

Here is the public statement posted verbatim by Hoag Hospital about Dr. Jeffrey Barke:

“Yesterday, Orange County physician Dr. Jeffrey Barke participated in a social media interview and post espousing his personal and radical views on COVID, masking and hydroxychloroquine. Members of the community mistakenly associated him with @hoaghealth. To be clear, he is not an employee and does not hold admitting privileges at Hoag Hospital. His personal views in no way represent the views of Hoag or Hoag Medical Staff, and are inconsistent with those of all recognized medical and scientific organizations. We are deeply disturbed that his views could mistakenly be associated with ours, because they are so diametrically opposite. Hoag has actively promoted masking and other CDC recommendations, and will continue to do so as we care for our patients and the community.”<//Text>< rating>

A lot of good, solid recommendations and comments about this physician, here and elsewhere.. And some ridiculous and unwarranted criticism by those who only wanted to hear what they wanted to hear. (If they knew so much about it all to begin with, why did they ask the doctor's opinion?)< /text>

Dr. Barke does not believe in masks during a pandemic. Yet takes in Covid-19 patients at his office. What a great way to continue getting business. Convince people they won't get sick and make a quick buck off of them once they do. Genius!<//Review>

<review>Dr Barke is a danger to his patients and to the wider community.  By using public health issues to support his wife on the Board of Supervisors he has involved himself in a clear conflict of interest and gone against the hippocratic oath.  The medical board should be reviewing his license and I would suggest any patients considering Barke to take into account his approach to infectious diseases, which seem to be anti-science, anti-public safety.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>This Dr states that children are low risk to dying from Covid-19 which is correct, but children do not live in bubbles nor do their parents. As they get sick they will contribute to community spread. How does he not understand this? Doesn’t seem that smart. Covid needs to be under control before mass gatherings like school happens. Just like 20 and 30 year olds getting drunk at a bar spreads beyond just them so will it with children in school.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Only good things to say, Richard and Freddy kept the store open for my friend shopping for his fiancée. I was so impressed that although he only had a modest amount to spend they treated him like a VIP. Will definitely go back and recommend to local friends.< /review>

So many shops you walk into and get treated a certain way when you try to buy a Rolex. Not here. Very happy with my purchase and very much looking forward to another watch. I will be shopping here long term.

Also bought a ruby ring. It was of very high quality which is frankly unusual for a mall jewelry shop.

I am also told that they now carry pre owned rolex, tudor and Breitling. Lookong forward to checking out their used selection of watches soon.

Thank you!<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I could not be happier with my experience at Royal Maui Jewelers. Their craftsmanship is top notch and they worked so quickly. They kept me updated every step of the way and the pricing was very reasonable. I would recommend them for any custom jewelry needs. You can't go wrong here.< /text>

The staff is extremely knowledgeable and most importantly they are not pushy and will give you honest opinions and advice! They will take their time with you and make you feel as if you are their best customer. After recently purchasing a preowned Rolex Date-just, then having another watch polished and a piece of gold jewelry repaired, they've got a customer in me for life.< /review>

I made an appointment with Hunaida and was never disappointed. Made the appointment same day, she was so patient with us and gracious.  Very professional, answered all my questions.  I went back several times for fittings and engraving and could not be happier with Hunaida.
If you're looking for that gorgeous engagement ring at a good price, go see Hunaida at Royal Maui Jewelers!!< /Text>

I loved my experience at Royal Maui. I was referred here by a friend and was told Hunaida the owner is awesome to work with and very experienced . I needed an engagement ring to purpose to my partner and this was a whole new experience for me. Hunaida was very helpful  and took the time always to answer all my questions as well as work with my budget and ideas I had. I would highly recommend and thanks again.< /review>

<Review>Bought a white gold ring from these guys to match the 7k engagement ring I bought.  It snapped at the solder point hard 3 years later, I’m talking a quarter centimeter gap.  It happens and figured we would have to get it repaired.  I sent a picture to a friend who makes jewelry, he said when they refitted it they did not do it correctly.  They tried to get me to pay $95 just to resolder it, then when I said I it shouldn’t of broken they went down to $75.  Give me a break, if the ring snaps because the people you use aren’t resizing correctly, that is your fault.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Nice  jewellery store with some very cute and adorable designs. they have creative shapes and patterns. It is something for classy ladies, even  young girls would like, but with mature and sophisticated feel to them with delicate attention to details.
The store has a comforting environment that makes it a pleasant place to drop by if you are hanging out around the area. You might be able to pick up a unique piece of jewellery that you won't find anywhere.< /Text><UserId.>113304405110686682901</UserId.><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Very nice selection of jewelry. Svetlana is very honest and professional. No hidden fees...no bogus insurance plans etc...  I did not feel any pressure even when I said I needed to check out other stores. Svetlana knew I'd be back to make the purchase. I absolutely love, love, love my ring. I also love knowing nobody else has one just like it. I'd give 10 stars if I could!<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND RUN AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me and my wife went there to shop for a Rolex, Tal which in my opinion is not a very honest guy, gave us wrong information just to get us to come back.
1. They promised us a $300 discount
2. 0% interest for 12 month
3. $0 down payment
4. They offered to ship our watch to vegas to avoid paying taxes, THATS A FRAUD AGAINST THE TAX AUTHORITIES, WE WOULD NEVER AGREE TO IT.
We came back to the store after researching and finding out they proposed a good deal.
HERE IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING...
They said they first want to run our credit to see if we will get approved and then they will honor their proposal, we said ok.
After they ran the credit, and got us approved, they came back saying they can only do $150 off, when we said NO they offered $300 off with only 6 months 0% interest, when we said NO, then they came back with $150 off with 12 months 0% interest ALL WE WANTED IS FOR THEM TO HONOR WHAT THEY PROMISED FROM THE FIRST PLACE.
THEY KEPT ON PLAYING GAMES WITH US UNTIL WE SAID ENOUGH AND JUST LEFT THE STORE!!!
THE SAD PART IS THAT THEY RAN OUR CREDIT FOR NOTHING AND OPENED AN $11,000 line of credit to our name.
The manager of the store was super rude and starting cursing us and telling us we waisted her time when she understood there will be no sale here. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS THEIR COMMISSION. We already consulted with our lawyer and laying our options he is also going to reach out to Rolex and to the financing company
DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND STAY FAR FAR AWAY.< /Text>< pictures>

Dr Swanson is very personable and knowledgeable.  With the equipment his staff used, he was able to show me a lot of details regarding the health of my eyes.

Dr. Swanson and staff are thorough with exams. They are professional, knowledgeable. He explains everything and answers your questions. They are friendly, caring and compassionate. I have referred my husband because they are the best. He has diabetes and needs the knowledge and care Dr. Swanson provides.</Text>

<Date>1589210964787</Date><text>You'd think I'd visit Roseville to visit my parents who live here,  and arrange to see the optometrist during my visit. But actually, I come to Roseville for Dr. Swanson, and stop by my parents during my visit. I have been going to Dr. Swanson for the last 20 years. I moved a few hours a way for a couple years and couldn't find an optometrist even close to the quality and care that he provides. Now, I still live 1.5 hours away, and I decided to make the drive and continue care with Dr. Swanson because he's just that good. Didn't realize how good I had it till it was gone, so now I'm making making sure I stay. Love Dr. Swanson.</text>< gmapID>

I have been a patient of Dr Swanson not only when he was in private practice but continued when he joined the team at Clear View Eye Care.  Dr. Swanson always takes the time to assess clearly the condition of your vision and any changes that he recommends that will only improve your sight.  I value Dr. Swanson and highly recommend him.</text>

Dr. Swanson has been our trusted eye doctor for the last 25 years.  He is professional and personable.  He explains our eye health test results in detail.  Unfortunately we will be moving to another state soon and we unsuccessfully tried to get him to move too.  I would highly recommend Dr.
Swanson to anyone who is looking for an excellent eye doctor.</Text>

<userid>111635939226218496035</userid><review>Terrible, terrible terrible!!!! I've brought 3 vehicles to this Firestone location and all 3 times it was not good. 1 car had an transmission flush and oil change done and they forgot to press the dipper down so as we were travelling our car started smoking and transmission fluid sprayed every where causing our car to have transmission problems. We ended up having to get rid of the car because it just was going to cost too much to fix it. The other 2 times were 1 car had faulty spark plugs causing it to sputter when we are driving and the other car they did not properly put in the air filter causing the car to have weird noises. Either they need to hire new, knowledgeable employees or retrain the ones they have. Either way the mechanics need to do a better job. Never will I bring my cars to this Firestone location!!!!!!<//review><time>1616360078492< /time></record>

What good is a appointment system when you show up and you're told its a 2 hour wait and you here excuses about lunch breaks. Management should do a better job managing around there online appointment schedule.</Review>

I have been coming for years and years  to this place and I have to say that the costumer service is excellent!!! A bit pricy for me, but it is worth it. The people working there are friendly, professional and are taking care of your car the way you would do it yourself. The best place in Fresno for your car....I have tried other places, but none of them - not even close - is as great as this one. Thank you all who are working so hard to make me happy!!!<//text>

I would absolutely not recommend I have been there a few times now. I have payed them alot of money for poor work and extremely long waits. They replaced my front axel assembly on my 2009 nissan rogue. And I brought it to another shop because it started having other problems and they discovered that firestone mechanics had actually leaked away a significant amount of transmission fluid as result of the front axel replacement. Do not go here period.<//review>

Customer Service was great and knowledgeable !! The store is busy so set an appointment!!! Even though they're busy they'll give you several Different options to pick from for appointments. Also a good bonus was you can get online look the store up and there is a coupon you can use for an oil change for $24.95.</review>

I have been taking my vehicles to Firestone Auto care for years and this review is long overdue. I have always received excellent service from Firstone both in Clovis and Fresno locations as well as by phone. The front desk staff are always friendly and professional. Guillermo is the store manager at the location on West Shaw in Fresno and treats me like a personal guest and is very thorough. He takes the time to answer all my questions regarding the diagnostics and assessments of my vehicle. Remembers to apply every discount possible to my bill, and makes time to do quick checks on my car if i come in short notice because an indicator light came on in my dash.  Usually I would recommend scheduling an appointment but it is not always necessary.  One day I stopped by on my way to work with limited time. One staff member advised me they were busy so I would have 1 1/2 hour wait so I decided to leave and wait for the weekend, but because Guillermo recognized me as a regular customer he stopped me on the way out and did the oil change himself.  They always provide suggestions and recommendations on vehicle maintenance and repairs with no pressure to buy or upgrade.  It's almost like a Dr. Office for your car. "These are the ailments we observed, this is how long what you have will last, it's up to you if you want to fix it.  We wish you a nice day." I like that about them. Guillermo is also personable he refers to me by my family name, asks about our children, and inquires about how the family has been doing since our last visit.  He goes, above and beyond what is needed to repair and maintain our vehicles in optimal working order. Thank you Firestone.<//review>

Every time you get an appointment, you end up waiting 1-1 1/2 hour to get something simple like tire rotations done. They seem to be always behind & couple times I called ahead & they said yes bring the car over now we'll do it right away. Then you show up & the guy with glasses keeps telling you "it'll be few hours"!! Walk next door to Discount Tire and they get the work done in no time!<//text>

Derrick the manager has been very helpful, and kept things on track for me

I have consolidated my basic vehicle repairs and tires to Firestone so that I can get nationwide back up in the event of tire problems.  Reservations on line are convenient, especially being able to let them know that you will be waiting for the car.<//text>

<review>Needed a speciality tire for a BMW 228i. Every tire shop I called wanted $305-$370 out the door. Not only was this the only tire shop that came under $300. In actuality this tire shop was $33 cheaper coming in at $267. Also, Firestone, honored my miltary service with a discount. The reason I am stating the military discount is becuase 70% of shops said, "I already gave you the lowest price sorry I can't do anything else for you." And the other 30% only gave military discount on labor/service. Firestone gave me 5% miltary discount on the total cost. While some may not understand what miltary members go through in their time in service. Coming to Firestone made me feel like they understood. Even though I couldn't have the tire installed (missing tire lock key) their service and pricing was excellent. Thank you Firestone.</review><username>Bubba D</username>< userid>

Awesome experience and a great tasting sandwich to boot. I ordered a number 12 with swiss cheese on a dutch crunch roll, the portions were perfect and the sandwich was efficiently packed.< /Review>

<Review>FANTASTIC SANDWICHES!!
A friend of mine brought me to The Sandwich Spot @ Milpitas after running a few errands in the McCarthy Shopping Plaza. I was hesitant because there are a ton of options there, but they insisted that the sandwiches were awesome and completely worth it. I order the #16 and it was FREAKING GREAT! The sourdough is so good and the ingredients were fresh and delicious. The employees were so nice and helpful! I will be making the trip again to visit. Another plus, the menu is extensive and they have quite a few veggie options for our plant-based friends.<//Review><user_name>Charlene Payne</user_name><Date>1560352956990< /Date>< Resp>

They have great sandwiches, however, with that being said, they should put more attention and focus to the in store customers, just the same as they do the online orders. Will not be back. Mountain View is much better.< /text>

<text>I was working on a project close by and when I found out they had a sandwich spot 2min. Away.. I was excited.

The one on San Jose and Redwood City all have a different feel, but they keep the great taste and style the same.

I love the way they treat customers, they truly want you to be there.

This one is small, so seating can be decided as you order. Lunch time is tough.

I say, stay way from the fast food option, when you have this place next door.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808fc8df3d42ec1f:0x21cf7425d2d1d54< /gmapID></record>

So we went on a brunch date for Valentines day and absolutely loved this place. It looked like a family run business with a very friendly staff, and is a small place

We ordered a Natasha's Heart Attic sandwich with Dutch crunch, swiss cheese and secret sauce. The sandwich was yummy and saucy and the secret sauce really takes up the taste bud.< /review>

We love the sandwich spot! We choose to go here whenever we have a family event (like Father's Day today) because every one of us LOVE these sandwiches and there's something for everyone! The owners are super friendly and personable.  The service is fast (we order 10 sandwiches at a time) and the ingredients are always fresh and tasty!<//text>

I arrived at 4:45pm with the door wide open and a lady came out saying they were already closed. Don’t advertise your open till 5pm if your going to not stay open till then, it’s bad for business and completely unprofessional.< /Review>< pics>

I picked the place based on the rave reviews. It seemed like a nice place, but the sandwich didn't do for me. I didn't see it any different from other sandwich places. There was hardly any avocado on mine. Lot of bread. For $10 sandwich I was expecting more. Next time if I come, I will try with the sliced bread instead.< /Review>

Great place, wonderful customer service, very friendly and inviting and, of course, tasty sandwich. Went out of their way to find the ingredients for the "DIrty Bird Sandwich, which is served at one of the other locations.  We will definitely return and recommend this sandwich spot.</Text>

Ordered the Shark Tank on Dutch Crunch. Food was ready quickly, manager at the front was super nice, offerered every one of their sauces on the side and gave free fruit snacks. On top of the excellent service, the bread and food was delicious. Up there as a top sandwich place with any other.</Text>

<review>Good ingredients but they only provide one slice of cheese for an entire sandwich. Not a good value for money and not very good with not nearly enough cheese.

<rating>1< /rating><Review>The manager (owner?) served me severely undercooked bacon and then tried to argue with me about it. He proceeded to tell me that the stretchy, translucent bacon was fully cooked. I told him no it isn't and I'd like to have my BLT with fully cooked bacon. He then brought the bacon out to me multiple times to show me how cooked bacon looks (as if I don't know) and handled every slice with bare hands to show me. I insisted on a refund immediately because of this unsanitary behavior.

I've completely lost confidence in the ability of this place to provide a safe and sanitary eating experience. I would not recommend eating here unless you're looking to contract trichinosis and spend the couple weeks with a parasitic infection.</Review>< pictures>

For years I have been going to Togos across the street. But now that The Sandwich Spot is here, I gladly choose to lunch here from now on.
New sandwiches (not spooned out of pre-prepped canisters like Subway). Nice crew and I enjoy the display of local fun art on the walls.</Text>

I've pretty much given up on sandwiches since I had to cut out gluten for medical reasons.  The tri-tip sandwich on gluten free bread here, changed my mind!  I'll definitely be back for more!<//Text>

Tasty sandwiches, good bread, lots of options. Sandwiches are only one size and very filling. Arrive hungry.<//text>

< Review>
Grabbed a tuna sandwich for lunch. Was okay. Nothing special about the tuna.

Not sure if I would try the tuna again. Maybe go for something with more meat.</Review>

This was my first time at this breakfast (also has lunch) restaurant. I would rate this place at 4.5 stars compared to other kinds of Dinner's; Food was big portions, tasted good, server was very honest not trying to oversell, seemed like a home vibe because of the employees attitudes.  The cons are the ambiance, and the seats are needing a remodel. Not bad for a true dinner; I feel that pros outweigh the cons. For this reason I give it five stars .... but it really is more like 4.5 to 4 stars. I will back 😆😎< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>This place offers great tasty meals that won't leave you broke, been open since 1977. Many senior's love it an have been going there many years cause of the warmth there make them fill welcome an the employees knowing them by first name really make it feel welcomed too. Don't let this small place fool you as you enter. Plenty of seating. Worth eating there.< /Review>< pictures>

Ate lunch here today with a friend.

The staff was very friendly. She took our drink order right away...and then the order. We did not have to wait very long..I had a groupon... that's what brought me in.

I ordered the cowboy burger. The bacon was crispy...it came with bbq sauce on the side...and onion rings.  Lettuce..tomato..pickles.

The burger was so good... the fries crispy.  I would certainly come back here to eat again...< /Review>

<review>So this was my first time going to Eggies and I wanted to try it because I had heard a lot of good things about it. So I went and immediately noticed a few things, the establishment is pretty dirty, the carpets look sticky, the bathrooms look like they only get cleaned once a week and the food was quite bland despite how good it looked. I had ordered coffee with my breakfast and had to request a new cup because the first one I received had someone else’s leftover lipstick on it. The prices were decent but I don’t think I will be returning.</review>< UserId.>

<text>My daughter took me here and I loved it. Food was great, homemade taste and fabulous flavor. server was friendly and attentive. Then I took my parents and had a very bad experience with the waitress. My parents speak no English so they ordered in Spanish and she seemed offended even though she was bilingual,  she "Threw the menus on the table and left moody. After that my parents needed explanation on the senior menu and she rudely told them the menu was very "obvious" my parents got offended and we decided to leave but she made sure to make us pay the coffee bill even though she never gave us a refill😑</text>< pictures>

<review>2nd time in Sacramento. 1st time at Eggie's, and what a treat it was! As a foreigner travelling America in my quest for the greatest biscuit (scone in my language) I do believe ladies and gentlemen, it is in this fair establishment....I HAVE FOUND IT!

Best place to get breakfast in the entire north Sacramento area. I go in once a week maybe for a large breakfast. My food always comes out fast and hot and it tastes great. Wait staff is friendly and always on point. The main cook even came out and sat with me one time and made me feel appreciated just because he noticed I'd been in there a few times. Also need to mention you get a good amount of food for the price compared to any other restaurants in the area. The furniture is old and some things in the place need replacement or maintenance for sure but it's otherwise clean and comfortable. Eat here.<//review>

Good food, no line whatsoever, very slow day. I was surprised. On scale of 1 to 10, the booth we were sitting in would rate #2. It was hard as a rock, with lots of tape for the patches. The service was excellent, #10. The food, nice and hot, the way we like it, a #9.<//text>

<Text>The food is always good here.  Service is hot and cold,  and the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired.  I had shorts on today and had to slide across a completely duct taped booth seat, very uncomfortable.  They use good quality meats, and you pay a little more for it.  One more thing,  a lot of restaurants are deep frying their breakfast potatoes. Some people like it, I don't.  Eggies deep fries their home potatoes,  and they offer hash browns too.<//Text><Time>1563576201492</Time><Resp>None</Resp>< UserId.>

Great place for breakfast or lunch. Extensive menu of traditional breakfast fare, along with a decent menu of Mexican dishes.  Dining area is a little shabby (they've been there since 1977, they've earned it).  Prices are a little high, but reasonable. Staff is friendly and attentive. Food is plentiful and tasty.<//text>

<Text>My whole family has been coming here for years. The staff is friendly, the food in usually pretty good, definitely large portions. It can get very busy on weekends. The only suggestions I would make would be to make a better effort with the cleaning of their dishes, I've had dirty cups and silverware on multiple occasions. As well as cleaning of your booths. There is always something stuffed in the booth, and things stuck to the seats.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The food was okay. Not bad, not great. I'd say slightly overpriced for what it's worth... But man this place needs a makeover. I get it's a diner, but the seats and sofas should not be taped with duct tape to cover tears. At that point chairs and tables are much better... Cozy feel and okay food.<//text>

I've been to Eggie's countless times, and my only issue is with the eggs themselves. I don't find the scrambled eggs to be breakfast restaurant quality, but the service is always extraordinary and I have had better luck with lunch than breakfast. It's a great local place and, unlike Casey's, they accept credit cards.<//review>

Love the portions and most of the staff are good, interactive people. The gravy rocks... sausage. So good but the place is getting a little old and could use some love for the booths... duct tape works for only so long.

It could use a little bit of a make over, some reinvestment in the atmosphere and table settings.< /Review>

<text>Since 1977, Eggie's has been serving Sacramento. I feel honored to be served here! I walked in at felt at ease, as though I was walking in to a familiar place, shattering my perceptions of space and time.

Biscuits and gravy were spot on delicious! Garlic in the gravy adds a yum delight. Homemade biscuits. This is one of the best plates of B&G I've had in my travels. And my blood is white country sausage gravy. My soul yearns daily for B&G.

Bacon was crispy salty good. Coffee was standard yet decent.

Wait staff was super per friendly. This place has a home nostalgic feel. I enjoyed my brief time here and wanted to linger to hear secrets told by the walls.

T-shirts available for purchase.

This restaurant is amazing. Sit at the counter if you want. You'll be glad you did.<//text>< time>

<review>Excellent food we come here quite often and there breakfast
Is really good . and size portions as well   i do see there getting bad reviews about there there seating area and the condition of the restaurant but who cares
Your not sleeping on it  and there food makes up for it .dosen't bother me i will sit on the floor as long as there food is good. but the only thing i agree on is that they only take cash kind of weird because everyone only use credit cards  They need to  work on that other than that quite frankly I think this is the best breakfast around....< /review><date>1576444257920<//date><Response>None< /Response>< username>

<text>An old style cafe with quality food for tge price, I usually go for breakfast. The hashbrowns are always crisp to perfection with ample servings. If you want something fancy or impressive you are at the wrong place. If you want a good meal at a more then reasonable price and have cash (only form of payment excepted) this could be your place to eat.</text><user_id>108976037309367869495<//user_id>< Rating>

I REALLY like this place. Is there duct tape on the seats? Yes.  Does it seem as though it hasn't been updated since the 60s?  Yes. Is it a great place to get breakfast in peace with a smile?  You bet!  You won't regret being here.<//Text>

Family owned and operated (hands on) since 1977. Extra friendly, fast service with attentive staff that included on our visit two of the family members in full swing helping us enjoy a great meal. One was our waitress, who was excellent and we met her brother who was in the kitchen (he personally delivered a steak to me that I had sent back because it was a little under cooked for me, he was apologetic and they even discounted my order because of it, I was very impressed with the customer service) Large menu with everything a breakfast appetite could ask for including Eggs Benedict in various presentations, huge 4 egg omelettes, steak and eggs with hash browns or country fries, lots and lots more. Not the newest building or the latest decor but you will find a place that might be your go to place for very good food and service.</Text>

So sad. This has always been a great breakfast stop. Went for food. Atmosphere was casual and clean. Atmosphere has changed. Staff is indifferent. They once had wonderful biscuits. Had one today that was terrible. Avoid the biscuits. Get the feeling they are in transition. Unlikely we will go back. Omelet was just ok. They were once fantastic!<//review>

<Review>Looks like this is an established place that has been around for awhile -- older looking spot. The food is sometimes great, sometimes decent. The portions are big and price is comparable to other breakfast places. This location closes early, mid-day I believe. The employees are nice.<//Review>< pics>

April's an awesome server! Was lost in-between the notorious corned beef and hash w/eggs and the full house. Stumped on what I should order, April recommended the corned beef and hash w/eggs. BEST choice ever! I thank her for making my morning with this delicious breakfast 😊</Review>

I was a regular here until we moved out of the Arden area. In my opinion Eggies has the best breakfast in the neighborhood and very decent lunches too. The corned beef hash is excellent, made with fresh corned beef. The country gravy is delicious on whatever they put it on.  This trip I got the breakfast bowl.  Hash browns under a biscuit with five or six sausages and what looked to be 3 eggs covered in gravy.  It was wonderful.< /Text>

<review>Tastes like real breakfast food! I stumbled on their 2 egg omelet with 2 ingredients of your choice. This was perfect for starting my day. Staff is super nice. Guacamole is fresh and their fruit is really good. I'm all about fresh food and Eggie's is too.</review>< Rate>

I love the food here! And I love the ladies that work here. It's a small diner. It's old. It needs some new furniture and decor. But I don't come here for the furniture or the decor, I come for the food and the good service. Though we now live out of town, we still come up to Eggies for breakfast. I love their pork chops and eggs. I also recommend the chicken and waffles since you basically get half of a cornish hen. The food here is always so yummy! The service here is great. We get here pretty early, so the two waitresses that are here early are always so nice and happy to see us. This is by far my favorite place for breakfast in the Sacramento area.<//review>

<Review>I'll get into why I gave this place 3 stars in a minute, but first I wanna say the service here was excellent. Very attentive and friendly staff.
When it comes to the food, it was OK. My boyfriend ordered an omelet with hash browns. I ordered blueberry pancakes with eggs. I enjoyed my bf's meal much more than my own. The omelet was delicious, and if I ever go back that is what I will order. My pancakes were a little gummy and my eggs were flavorless. All they would have to do is add salt and pepper and I'm sure my eggs would have been much better.
Lastly, the worst part of my experience was the atmosphere on the inside. From the outside, Eggies looks like a cute little retro diner. But on the inside, man can it use some renovation! The side of the restaurant in which we were seated was dark, gloomy, and the carpet was dirty. The booths look like they were about to fall apart. The chairs are miss matched. Nothing exciting on the walls. Dull colors. It was just sad inside. If they were to make a few changes with the decor it would make all the difference.</Review><username>Nicole Luebker<//username><date>1527972330322< /date><userid>112570901091282062838</userid>< pictures>

Its gone downhill since the last time I've been there. (5 months ago) The carpet was dirty,  the booths were taped up. The bathroom's appeared to have been neglected for some time.  It's not like it use to be, family friendly atmosphere.<//review>

Arthur ate here...the place was busy with the morning rush, waited for a table for a short time...the wait staff are great....ordered the Original Breakfast...as we all know with cooking when brown it's done when black it's f#%ked... I asked for bacon and sausages, (the sausages no bigger than my little finger) with the order...the bacon and sausages would be considered as burnt offerings...it's the first time I've been here and won't be rushing back.</Text>

<text>Went to Eggies about 8:50am today 10/6/16. The staff are friendly and on top of service. I didn't have to wait long for food either. This was my first time here. The portions are very big and delicious. I had the breakfast chili verde burrito and a cup of coffee. It was super peaceful and relaxing. Felt at home vibe. I recommend this place. Try it out and see for yourself. You will not be disappointed.<//text><Rating>5<//Rating>< Resp>

< Review>
Amazing portion sizes!! I had the rojo breakfast burrito. The pork had great flavor all by itself. It could stand alone, but fluffy eggs, melty cheese, and green sauce adorn this tender meat like an emperor wears expensive robes. I would recommend all my friends put Eggie's on their to-do list.<//Review>

I go here probably once a month, the food is pretty good. I always get the Sonoma Joe which is a scramble of eggs, veggies and chicken sausage. The place needs a remodel, the building is dirty and run down.< /text>

Great breakfast spot , old school dinner grub . Nothing fancy just good , I wouldn't make big plans after eating you'll time for things to Settle portions are very large and to good not to finish. I've gone here for over 15 years and never had a bad experience , no frills just good .<//Text>

<Text>I ordered the Chile verde con huevos. My huevos were discovered to be "a la pelo" When I was almost finished eating them. Unfortunately, I'll never eat there again. The servers seemed attentive and nice, but the blond hair was too much to look past.
Best of luck to them and to you if you eat there.</Text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Food is pretty good. Prices are high. Chicken Fried steak and coffee costs over $20. They only take cash now no cards. I can only assume the owner didn't like paying the 2-4% and hassle of merchant services but I never carry cash anymore. I walked in once a month ago and left because I didn't have the cash. Provise an ATM at little cost on site rather than the gas station across the street that charges 3.50.  Unfortunately this decision is costing them business. I like seeing long term small business doing well but I really question this choice.

In short food is good, prices are high. Get the Groupon online<//Review>

The prices have gone up and with all the money they charge now they need to remodel with it. Chairs are talking apart and the booths have holes in them. Would be five but the inside could use some work</Review>

< Review>
Food and service was ok, the place needs a serious remodel upgrade. I noticed they have alot of loyal regulars. The waitresses were familliar with the regulars and their meal preferences. The food was good, country potatoes were slightly overcooked but portions were filling. Overall experience was good.</Review>

<resp>None</resp><time>1497556680887</time><review>I have been to Eggies many times and enjoyed the food and service.
Today I went with my kids and even though the place was empty, the service was horrible. The waitress never came back to see if we wanted more coffee or how the food was. Even when I asked nicely for more coffee, I had to go to the counter to ask someone for coffee.
The hash browns and home fries were served burnt and presentation of the plate was not good.  I gave a small tip out of habit, but wish I had not left anything as I write this.
Will try Eggies in a few weeks again and hopefully this was a one time problem.< /review><rate>2<//rate>< pictures>

I was Egg-cited (see what I did There lol ) to try this place ; but apparently they ONLY TAKE CASH . They have all major credit cards logo on the front door ; but paper handwritten signs posted that they only accept cash . They also don’t have an atm inside to get cash . Like most people I dont Carry cash except maybe $5 on me . There’s no bank within walking distance to get cash , so super inconvenient.< /text>

This place is an oldie but goodie. Improvements need to be made if they want to keep up. The furniture is dilapidated, and the bacon is never freshly cooked. This place was once a jewel in the area but it's seeing it's own decline. I'm still a fan because I know what it used to be.<//review>

This is a great place to eat. Great food & pretty good service.  There is no decor to the place, but the food is what gets people there. It was crowded the day we were there & I would think probably every day.<//text>

Service needs a slight improvement. Bathrooms gross.
Food prices are reasonable
The place could use some work.
If dinning area looks like it does and bathrooms are unclean does make me.wonder what Kitchen looks like. Hmmm< /Review>

<Review>I agree with Roberta somethings changed about this place.  That and I got food poisoning the last tome I went here.  Plus its kinda you see new stuff break and they dont fix it with any of the old stuff.  Plus the employees are just standing around talking about like personal stuff like somebodies moms an alcoholic and stuff.  Dude chill out with that stuff Im trying to eat breakfast.  Yeah anyway seems like this place is on its last legs wouldnt go here snymore at all.  Oh plus they like burned everything.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

It's ok I guess.  Too expensive for what you get. We showed up at 1230. And on the front door there is a sign that said cash only. Really cash only!  Who carries cash everything is plastic now days. Not going to return.< /Text>

<Text>I purchased a groupon for 40 dollars worth of food for 21 dollars. I can't get the voucher printed, can't pull it up on my phone. No one's helping me get my monwy back. Groupon just sends me email after email everytime i give them the information they ask me for more information. This has gone on for two weeks with still no reaolution. I'll never buy groypon again. I'll never eat here again. I call Eggies and I'm told oh well sorry but that has nothing to do with us. Ummm really its your business who marketed the groupon!</Text>< Pics>

<review>Good thing I had a coupon!

This was the blandest breakfast I've ever had. The white gravy tasted like flour and water with no flavour. The pancakes were dry and thin. The chicken fried steak was bland. The buscuits weren't really buscuits, they were cut from a sheet of baked dough. They were dry and bland. The srambled eggs were done well but that's not saying much. I've never smoked so it can't be blamed on dulled taste buds.

I am a fanatic about southern breakfast and have had many exceptional ones in my day-this goes down as exceptionally awful. Its a shame really because I live across the street and was thrilled that there was an american diner right on my doorstep. Sigh 65$ for a whole lot of leftovers that I had to fix when I got home by making my own country gravy!

Go anywhere else. Every Dennys can pull off a better brekkie!</review>< pictures>

I like coming here because the portions are big and the price is right, especially since I have 5 kids. Go to their web site to access Groupon coupons.< /review>

My family and I went here for brunch. Looks disgusting the food is way overpriced you would think for a $14.99 eggs benedict they could afford to fix the seats I sat down on my duct tape seat ordered coffee and started to look at the menu and around the restaurant after we had to go to the counter to get sweetener and creamer because there was no service we decided not to eat here paid for just the coffee no tip and left. This "restaurant" does not deserve the rating it has will never go there again. I don't imagine this place still being open in a year.< /Review>
