Never going back ! Got a full set and all of them have air bubbles in then. Looks like a already need a fill. They always start the nails away from the cuticles just so you have to go back sooner.  Do not recommend going!< /text>

READ LADIES ! It’s been three days since I got my eyebrows done and I have bumps around my eye. I was growing out my eyebrows for over 6 months.  I walked in to get my eyebrows cleaned up and even though there was a sign that stated they threaded, the lady told me only wax. She then asked me “oh just a clean up”. I replied yes. I had a nice shape and she literally took off so much hair that now I have so much space between my eyes and eyebrows. She didn’t do the top part because apparently “your eyebrows are already crooked and they look weird”. I payed and when I got to the car realized that she literally left them so thin and uneven. I will never return there for eyes brows, the only reason I went there in the first place was because my usual place is closed.</Text>

They were very nice, really good job besides drawing some blood on my ring finger from cutting a little too close to my cuticle. Besides that, good service.<//Review>

The service is great, everyone is very friendly. I am a regular customer here and rarely is there ever a long wait time the max i have waited was maybe 5mins twice? But I usually get taken in right away. The prices are the best in town! Lots of gel colors to choose from and i have never had any problems with my acrylics chipping or the polish peeling 👍🏼< /review>

<Text>Very surprised at the negative reviews. Went for my first time yesterday for a basic full set. For how busy they were, they greeted me, the wait wasn't longer than 20 minutes, and the gentleman who did my nails was very polite. I love my nails. The gel is beautiful, nails are done exactly as I asked him to do them, and the place was pretty clean.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80952b92a1e003e5:0x532f4453fc905e33<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>If I could I would give this place 0 stars I would. The service was poor, my girlfriend had to wait for over an hour when they told her 30 minutes. The man who did her nails was rude and unprofessional, and he did a poor job. Two of her fingers were clipped and bleeding, and she asked for coffin shape, and they came out as a poor quality square. When he was done he practically threw her hand and then he was rude about not getting a tip. Overall don't come here if you want good service, no pain, and good quality nails.<//text></record>

Got a fill and this lady made the base of my thumb so thick and it feels like a odd bump and one nail she did do since it fell of from the last set I had she made it too thick. I don't know her name but she's a very petite older lady. Just don't bother this lady is trash< /Review>

This place is awesome. It is in the perfect size for a nail salon with plenty of space and many chairs. Last time, I didn't make an appointment but they came with me right away. They also had a huge collection of polish and gel colors. The services were also very good at reasonable prices. Highly recommend.<//review>

Glamour Nail & Spa is awesome. They do a really good job and the gel actually stays on for a few weeks. Another thing i am really concerned about the hygiene in nail salons and this place is definitely clean. This place is really professional and i feel super comfortable and relaxed here!<//Text>

Unprofessional and low quality.  Showed a picture of the nails I wanted to the "nail tech" and asked him if this was possible. He said yes of course.  He tried to do the ombre with nail polish and his fingertip -_- when he finished it looked terrible. Also made my finger bleed. I'd avoid this place. Over priced as well.</review>

Moved here a few months ago and I was very nervous about finding a new nail place.  Glamour nails is awesome! Very clean!   Very friendly and very reasonable pricing!!!  I've seen other reviews about the wait time.  #1 if you don't like to wait make an appointment #2 if there is a wait that means they're a busy salon and that speaks for itself!!!  I'm a regular now!< /Review>

Average. Unsatisfied with the nail services, customer service was good, they were friendly, helped out immediately and had two girls working on me. The girl who did my pedicure didn't do a great job, I had to tell her to get in there otherwise she wouldn't have. The girl who did my gel didn't add my glitter nail like I wanted and I didn't notice bc I was too busy making sure the other girl did my toes how I liked. I probably won't be coming back.< /text>

DO NOT GO HERE!!!!  I went to get my nails done yesterday and the nails were not painted all the way to the bottom and when i asked why it was not complete the person who did my nails said that it depended on my body temperature for the nails to fill. That never happened my nails looks about two weeks old and they were done yesterday. People who have seen them said they look; amateur, misshaped and messy, they were not filed down and i actually had to ask them to redo a nail and I should of had them do them all over. You could see my real nail through the painted nail it was horrible. Please do not waste your money here. I actually had to paint over them for them to look nice. I wasted 35.00 dollars never again!</Review>

I went in to get my nails done. Glue all over nail beds, sloppy old polish used. So I went back they said oh you need gel. Ok. More $$ and then they peeled off on a few of them. Also did pedicure & probably the worst pedicure I have ever gotten. Once again, sloppy old polish and cut toenails where they did not match each foot. Today going in and requesting nails fixed correctly and refund. Not happy.< /text>

<review>I had a super nice mani last night at Nail Art. The girl who did for me was very knowledgeable on the products she used and has a great massage.  I think the value of my service was really high and I have already recommended Nail Art to my family and friends. I am looking forward to my next visit and will try a pedi.
Great location, easy to book a time, receptionist was friendly and helpful.< /review>< Response>

I got my nails done there today and it was horrible I wanted matte white and matte red  Marble I got one blob of red with a clear nail when I asked if they were going to put white the guy told me no I don't know how  and I ended up walking out with plain white nails that were painted so bad and one hand the nails were long the other the nails were short I am so embarrass that I have to walk around with these nails and I paid almost $50<//review>

Went in for a fill when it's says 17$ and still got charged for a 35$ full set. No good communication and just really annoyed now that I have to walk around with uneven nails that aren't even painted all the way. 4/20/2017<//Text>

LOVE this park. We come multiple times a week. Very clean & never too packed. Lots of shade and seats for parents.</text>

Large shade structure with benches, but the bathroom blocks your view so you can't watch the water pad and the playground at the same time. Not the worst thing, but annoying if you have multiple kids who go separate directions.<//text>

Nice friendly park with great play structures! Great big open fields perfect for soccer, baseball and football! There were some minor maintenance issues like soft fall needs to be added to the playground and some limbs had been cut and left behind,  but overall,  I'll go again!< /Text>

Been attending annually every memorial day since 2005 and it's been great to see the park has been kept up and decent all these years. No weirdos or unwelcomed trouble makers. 👍🏼</Review>

< Review>
Going up the mountain from the west end is considered a difficult hike. Erosion with the sand makes for tricky stepping on the way down. Bring good shoes.< /Review>

<Review>As a Midwesterner who is newly  moved here, mountains are a novelty and I love seeing them where I live. After hearing about the 5 Peak Challenge at Mission Trails Regional Park, I knew this was the challenge I needed since races in person are canceled for the time being.
The parking lot filled up quickly as noted but I easily parked on the road outside the lot. The path to the summit was busy for 8am, but everyone was moving at a easy pace and enjoying the gorgeous weather. There are parts of the path where you have to climb over rocks but overall it isn’t too bad. For the websites that said this is a great hike for kids, I say, what age, because this was a killer workout for me but to be fair, I come from straight flat land! Beautiful views at the peak. Bring water and a hat, the sun was beating down early in the morning.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqRHa_Z7CIhH9bjftrGU8PHKbigoIPITi0QZ5h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlBcN1o4TpnkYYFpTRYnxuCb3419MlnymPseAe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcffkFJZ-0wMBzTxk7ZwGRZyW_HUhC0YzZbS3p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMR9fjqP5fMYWhFAnsKT0hoZWMNLcp3cVCuouqS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPAQ2bFxvLWjIFuAZVUp7Gpaxt86DiqAGtP6WCn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzPh2XwS7-cIyM-Od_6_mKRW0qmOxSdnXuBkiM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

<date>1600043620014<//date><rate>5<//rate><Text>Really fun. Great views. Started going more often on my days off because the gyms were closed. Absolutely go early in the morning or at sunset otherwise theres many many people. Lots of crowds none in masks. Hike itself is rough if you rarely hike but many good places to stop and rest. I prefer going at sunset and night hiking. :^) Pre-covid going later there would be space in the parking lot. Potentially that will return in the future. :^)</Text>< user_name>

Weather is usually great, views are amazing, especially at sunrise and sunset. Many trails, at least five options I know about, could be more hidden trails. An option for every level, only the most popular are crowded.<//Text>

I finally went up this hill.  Not a bad short hike.  Easily up and back with in a hour. The crowds are probably one of the most condensed hike in SD. I was surprised by the view.  Its really nice.  Ill come back<//Text>

Great hike! It can be crowded on the weekends, but I definitely recommend you go onto Pyle's Peak. There's a lot less be people on that trail. There are beautiful views and very dog friendly!< /review>

<review>We really enjoyed the (steep) hiking we did around Cowles Mountain. The views were absolutely gorgeous!

The maps could be a bit easier to read with mile markers throughout the map so you don’t have to guesstimate how far you’re traveling from Cowles Peak to somewhere.

Beware: many folks here DON’T wear masks :( if this worries you, try coming on an off peak day/hour.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsD7_Ts6-In0Mdhg0tDBOvTloSfG6UQOj2UHyr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRwjexlgQr2yM3m46J-XTM23n4GFh_4xAU_2GP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Cowels mnt is my Go-To for relieving stress to just exercising. Please at least wear a mask going down!!! the people coming up hill that have to wear a mask are breathing much harder and it makes harder to catch your breath please take that into consideration thank you all and be safe.< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>My parents and I moved to the San Carlos area in the summer of 1963. I and the neighborhood kids used to climb Cowles Mountain, it was also called “Black Mountain”. I assume because of its color from a distance. I enjoyed climbing it until a friend found a rattlesnake-that was my last time on the mountain - 😁< /Review>< pictures>

I love hiking up Cowles' Mountain. Regardless of your fitness level making it to the top always feels like a major workout. The earlier in the morning you start, the easier your hike will seem. Bring water and enjoy!<//Review>

<Text>This is a great hike with great views at the summit. There are several approaches to the summit. From the Santee side which is a little more challenging and from a couple San Diego neighborhoods. At night you have great views of the city lights, in the day a great view of Lake Murray and the mountains to the south and east. It is also a great place to catch a sunrise or a sunset. Like always be in good enough physical condition, bring water, and wear proper clothing. Dogs are allowed on a leash. Be sure to have water for them as well.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkyjdlclqtqarpkdT4JMr4FAY8dHmE3f7C5-NM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNo5yN20BX1KT4c9YZF8CGMmsmpnf1Ns5tFOANm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlxl_1iBUuhTQ9PvOclNCID6aYUG0gqjzzCPd9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

A great hike for beginners; plenty of nice spots to take pictures and enjoy the views of San Diego. Would recommend a early or evening hike to get away from heat especially during the summers and as always bring plenty of H20!<//Text>

Do the back side of Cowles, it's more of an incline and less crowded. Lots of space since it's the fire roads.

<username>Martique Johnson</username><Text>One of the best hikes in San Diego. If you do it fast it can be a nice workout, or if you want to take your time or have children that's doable as well. Great views, cleanly, and overall a perfect hike. Also: It's Pet friendly as long as it not "too hot outside", and there are bike trails if that's your thing.</Text>< user_id>

A viee of multiple cities, landmarks and the ocean all in one place. The hike has been improved and doesn't have many inclines. Lots of places you can take a breather. A great hike all in all.< /Text>

This place is just amazing! I went here for a hike after waking up early because of jet lag.
The hike takes about 1.5-2 hours round trip with relaxing at the top.
You have a nice panorama view of San Diego. A perfect way to start your day</review>

I live 1/2 a mile from it since 1990  use to climb it all the time . Now sort of a cult follow ing in the summer " it's too busy nobody goes there anymore " now with 4 am and late night flash light hikes A type folks yelling On Your Left ! As they stumble past . Best to go a.m. in a group with lots of water for folks and dogs .</text>

You can't go wrong with Cowles Mountain. Great spot for a workout if you need to get some elevation - a great reminder of how small we are this big rock hustling through space. I mean to take San Diego in from Cowles is a must at some point if you spend any amount of time in SD. Be careful during the midday in hotter months ... It can turn into hell real quick if you aren't prepared with water and proper attire /sunscreen.<//text>

Cowles Mountain is the go-to hike in the City of San Diego. It's easy to get to from the 125 freeway off Navajo. Parking at busy times can be a real nightmare. Don't be surprised if you have to park 1/4 mile away and walk to the trailhead. But you're out for a good hike anyway, so what's an extra 1000 feet to you? Because the trail is popular, there does tend to be a lot of people on-site. If you are a fast hiker, you will likely get stuck behind some slower folks, but there are plenty of opportunities to pass them. The main trail is NOT open to bicycles, but you can ride a mountain bike up the eastern entrance / fire road that is available off of Barker Way. Cowles is popular for all ages and most abilities. There are a few spots where the rocks are steep, but don't let it be intimidating. Most of the trail is basic and smooth, with the occasion step(s) up. Often you will see the more athletic types RUNNING up and down the mountain. The round trip is about 50-120 minutes depending on your abilities. The view from the top is fantastic, which is part of why Cowles Mountain is so popular. Give it a shot today (or tonight... as many hikers take their flashlights to enjoy a night hike.)< /Text>

The difficulty added to the reward at the top of the mountain a beautiful Vista, sometimes climbing a mountain can give important insights to a critical situation in your life, block out all the noise and go for a hike in nature, embracing the beauty of this world, makes problems melt away or it brings clarity to circumstance whichever it is I suggest you go for a hike, you never know you may just "find yourself" on the way up< /review>

<Review>Would recommend for anyone coming to San Diego.
It's a short uber ride and there is free city wifi so you can order one for the way home too.
It's a 40 minute hike return trip for someone who is quite fit. Less active people may not make it to the top. Make sure you bring at least 1L of water, bring 2L if it's hot.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

How could I not give 5 star. The view is worth the hike. You keep walking and wonder when you will actually be getting there and just when you think you're at the top, you got 20 min more to go.
Anyways, I was bright enough to go hiking with a glass water bottle (who does that?) and on my way back down as I told myself.. after skidding just a bit on one corner that this was probably not a good idea (the glass), the next corner I took I ended up slipping on some dry dirt and smashed to the floor: it was like slow motion for me. Anyways, I am so thankful two young men following closely behind, or perhaps in front of me actually, helped clear the pathway of my glass, and most of all, sympathized with me, especially as I walked away looking like I was coming from a crime scene with blood all over my white (pretty sure) t-shirt, and hand.<//review>

Great views of downtown, La Jolla and East County. But, the trail is very, very crowded.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Good place for hiking, the route is quite light. It is very busy, there are many people every time I go! You can take your pet too! The parking lot is very small so you have to get there early or walk after finding a spot! There are bathrooms at the beginning of the route!

(Original)
Buen lugar para hacer hiking, es bastante ligera la ruta. Es muy concurrida, siempre que voy hay mucha gente! Puedes llevar a tu mascota también ! El parking es muy pequeño así que tienes que llegar temprano o caminar después de encontrar un lugar! Hay baños al comenzar la ruta !<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Beautiful place ! With panoramic views of the city. It's really worth it. Take a bottle of water, because with the dry climate it is good to stay hydrated. 😜

<text>I came to this place two times and both times were bad. They are very sweet but they did not give me what I asked for. I asked for square and they didn’t even give me that shape, it was more close to coffin. My cousin also got her nails done and they didn’t look right. They didn’t shape them right and they also cut her,  not once or twice but 4 times. We also waited an hour and a half to get our nails done. Don’t get me wrong ,they do good pedicures but not nails sorry.</text><Rate>1</Rate><gmap_id>0x80c2c9411e8d9043:0x3f2089b45b695d31< /gmap_id><response>None<//response>< time>

Great staff! Very nice with me and my siblings gave us great service to us four and they were about to close. Tracy the manager is very nice and outgoing. Daniel really knows how to do great acrylic nails. The rest of the staff was very nice and friendly</Review>

<text>Tracy and Daniel own it. They are the best Daniel for good fast service . Tracy is the nail artist. She is amazing. Let her create for you. My favorite pedicurist is Diane. Shes so good and designs well too. I must say they hVe a great staff no matter who you get.
I let tracy do everything waxing and my lashes Don't play. But my nail are always on point with tons of compliments. I Don't cheat because I get mad without the same quality. Please tell them DAENA sent you.<//text>< Pics>

I get powder fills with a gel finish here with Daniel and gel pedicures with whoever is available. My nails last at least 3 weeks, and look great. They are very welcoming, clean, do a great job with nails, and are reasonably priced.</text>

Good service and I liked my nails but when it came to paying it turned into a huge mess.

They had me try to withdrawl cash from their in-store ATM three times but it doesn’t go through. But I got charged transaction fees THREE TIMES! Then they tried charging my debit card directly and that supposedly didn’t go through.
I attempted to take out money again and it finally worked. I paid and I left but then I check my bank app and it shows that an ATM charge and a cash withdrawal. I got double charged and everything is still in processing. I just want my freaking money back! :/< /Review>

<text>Bad service. I used to come here all the time I haven’t been in months.
They took forever I waited over 2 hours. And when I chose the color it didn’t even look like the color i wanted.
Asked her why it looks different she gave me attitude and fixed the color in a rush.
Then when I was time for me to go she told me rudely I can leave. Never coming here again.</text></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Not recommended, they do not do the ones you ask me, they hurt my feet a lot because I already have 4 days and the pain does not go away and my fingernails were not done as I asked them so it is very expensive and badly done

(Original)
No recomendable no te hacen los q les pides ami me lastimaron mucho mis pies q ya tengo 4 días y no se me quita el dolor y mis uñas de las manos no me las hicieron como yo se las pedí así es q muy caro  y mal echo<//Text>

(Translated by Google) I did not like the price of the ad they say one and when they charge you it is another. I went for a pedicure and said k 19 and the xtra with massage and hot tuallas 25 and I did the regular thing without tuallas or massage and they charged me 27

This shop was truly amazing! The barber did a great job of doing my haircut, and I truly loved it. Honestly, it was the style that I looked handsome. I will greatly come back here and asked for another service because the place was clean, comfortable, and smell great. Even the entire shop was captivating and quite impressive. Thanks for the service. Highly Recommended!< /review>

<text>Figaro barbershop on Beverly delivers on customer service, value, and a great looking fade! My experience was better than expected. Alan was my barber! It was his first time cutting my hair. He recommend style 14 based on the fade I described. He also requested my input on length, guard size, and preference for with/against the grain. Trying a new barbershop can be a stressful; especially if you’re in a new city or your regular shop isn’t available. Check Figora on Beverly Blvd in Los Angeles, CA!<//text>< username>

I had an urge to get a haircut on a Sunday and they were open! Welcoming ambiance plus friendly barbers. My barber is an expert when it comes to hairstyling. He got exactly what I meant when I said the type of cut, perhaps an obsolete term. He nailed the cut and I walked away quite happy. Thank you so much!<//text>

Staff here is 100% compliant and work hard to keep everyone safe and healthy but the customers are only like 90% mask wearers. Not safe in an enclosed space!

<text>I had a haircut session from this barbershop. I extremely liked the service from them. The hairdresser suggested a haircut style which,   I appreciated the most. He made sure that I do look good with my new haircut,  and it turns out really great.  I will absolutely recommend this to my friends.</text>< pics>

I wrote this review to express how thankful and happy I am with your services. I thanked your barber for cutting my hair into a modern style. Actually, my friends love my new-look now. I will surely visit your barbershop again and again. Thanks to your barber again! Very strongly recommended to everyone!< /review>

This is a Great Barershop. I always go to Carlos whenever I need a cut he’s always consistent and does a great job. Been coming here for like 2 years, and I’ve never had a problem. Good environment overall. I never  struggle to find parking, parking is always found on location.< /text>

<Response>None<//Response><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I have been going to supercuts and other barbershops all my life but nobody could quite make me look the way I wanted. There was always something that I didn't like. But when I went to this barbershop, the guy cut my hair exactly how I wanted, without much instructions from me. At this time the price is $15, but it's kind of implied that you need to pay $20 but still worth every penny considering the amount of time they spend on you. It's not like supercuts where they spend like 10 minutes on you and kick you out.< /review>< Pics>

<review>I took my son in for a haircut and I have to say that Allan was very patient with him. He was very friendly. I was very pleased with the hairstyle. He's an excellent barber. I highly recommend Allan.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I went in there at 12.30 pm.
It is 1.45pm and i still hadnt gotten served.
What made this barber shop regretable to of had went to was that when it was mone turn i got skipped twice and they still didnt know who was next. I absolutely do not recomend this barber shop to any one.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I came in to the bank on 7/21/21. I was greeted at the front with a smile and was told to have a seat. Joshua greeted me and brought me to his desk and treated me very well. He was knowledgeable and extremely kind.

I explained to him that I have a business account outside of BofA and wanted to set up a personal account here so my clients could Zelle me money.

After everything was set up I explained that my clients sent 4 Zelle payments to my cell phone prior to opening the account. Joshua called the fraud team with me (instead of just telling me to call on my own).

I was upset with what the fraud team said. They said I couldn’t place the fraud reporting because the person who got the Zelle money needs to do the report. That is so ridiculous! So asinine!

But the fact that an employee treated me like a human being rather than a number, I just wanted to thank Joshua for trying so hard.

I recommend anyone that comes here to ask for Joshua! He deserves a raise!</Text>< pics>

<Review>I went to atm today to deposit 500 dollars but the receipt only showed that they paid 60 dollars and they completely ignored me. The just found a phone call and didn’t receive me at all. As a vip user my company business account is also opened here. It’s very hateful to still treat me like this Simon Fong refuses to see me afterwards and his attitude is very hateful. A hongkonger Kenny very bad attitude very rubbish l didn’t provide any help for the task l would never come back<//Review>< Pictures>

Emma gave me the worst customer experience of my life. She told me to take my mask off in front of everyone, just me, for the sole purpose of identifying me. She didn’t trust my California ID. Stay away from this Bank of America.< /Text>

Went in to cash a check (not even a large amount) with valid photo ID, my bank of america debit card, verified PIN, verified signature from issuer, sufficient balance to cover the check, and yet refused to cash the check.  The reason; the hand writing on the pay to did not match the handwriting on the check.  The check issuer had me fill in so he wouldn't misspell my name.  Refused to call to verify check.  Ended up driving to Diamond Bar branch to cash the check.   Horrible customer service.  Feel bad for anyone trying to cash a check.  Haven't went to that branch in over a year.< /review></record>

Bank of America is pushing customer away, they don’t want you and provides minimum services. Only 2 cashiers, waiting for 39 minuets in line. Don’t coming if you have other choices. Now, long line at 3 ATM machines and still no one at branch office care about this services.< /review>

<user_name>Ben Ha< /user_name><response>None< /response><Text>First off let me say that I do not bank here. I was just here to deposit money into a relatives bank account. When I arrived there were only 7 people in lone that were in front of me. It took me 30+ minutes just to do what I needed and get out. In that amount of time I can drive to orange county. Only three tellers and they took forever just to do anything. I bank at Wells Fargo and I deposit money to to her banks and none of them are as slow as this bank. I have also been to other bank of America in the area and they are also understaffed and slow. For this branch though I do not understand why they have so many people at the desk just sitting around done nothing and three people just standing near the front greeting others. Lazy employees. One of them ask how my day was going and what I was here for.  I told her it was great and asked her how her days was. She said ah were busy and I'm tired. Tired?!?!? She has been walking around doing nothing and your tired? I then told her maybe if you and your associates get behind the counter and help your tellers maybe you won't be so busy. She then said yeah we are helping. Glad I never banked with this boa. Other boas Ive been too are also as bad.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>There is something wrong about the reviews.
On 28th August 2018, morning, I have been over there with all the required documents to open a business bank account.
The place is nice, staff is professional.
A teller assisted me to fill up the forms and open my accounts.
I strongly recommend Bank of America and especially, Philip W.
Thank you, Bank of America.<//Review>< Rating>

Would give 0 stars if possible.  Waited 1.3 hours 3 consecutive times going to this bank for teller service.  Reflected to management, they brushed it off as in come when they aren’t so busy.  They have 3 tellers for 20 people waiting.< /Text>

Line takes 30-45 mins any time of the day any day in the week.  Not just this bank, all Bank of America branches are the same.  They just stopped caring about customer service.  Complain to any bank manager, they'll tell you the same thing; its from upper management, they're pushing customers to online or ATM. These idiots dont understand there are many banking transactions that cannot be done online nor at the ATM.  Maybe they should start handing out numbers like the DMV, or take appointments.  How bout handing out magazines to read while we wait?  I've been to 3rd world country hospitals, and lines move faster there.  My wife could probably deliver our baby while I'm still waiting in line at this bank.  Dont come to this bank if you need to be somewhere else within the hour; you will be late.  Dont come to this bank if you need to use the restroom, you will not make it.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Today it took me 25 minutes for waiting at line for cashier. There were two tellers with 15 customers waiting. I brought the concern to the bank associate, but it seems they do not really care about customers as much as other banks like Chase Bank. I have been with BOA for a long time just because it is nearby my house but its service is really terrible.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The clerk and supervisor of this bank can only deceive and shirk responsibility. One of my cheques from 19 years was stolen in 20 years. The cheque was my name and was deposited again by others. The person who wrote the check did not pass the transaction result and deducted the money from my account. I went to the bank to deal with it. At that time, I had a very good attitude. I checked the ins and outs. I also knew who stole my cheque. I said that the money would be returned to my account within three to five working days. As a result, two months later, I went to the bank to urge me more than a dozen times. First, the clerk lied to me that the cause of the epidemic arrived in two days, and then said that a confirmation letter to me was sent to the wrong email address, where it was sent to the person who stole the check, and then told me that it would be sent the next day, and then nothing , And then find an excuse to push the time. Later, he told me to wait 60 days, and he would pay me if I did not refund the money for 60 days. As a result, I called again today, and they told me that my case was over, and they told me that there was no way to refund my money, and they didn't provide me with service or a solution to the problem. What is the difference between such a bank and a robber? If this thing ends like this, is there any law and fairness in this country! ? Can banks really do whatever they want! ?

这个银行的业务员和主管只会欺骗和推卸责任。我19年的一张支票，在20年被偷走，支票是我的名字居然被别人又存了一次。开支票的人没通过交易结果从我的账户里把钱扣走了。我去银行处理，当时态度特别好，查清楚了来龙去脉，也知道是哪个人偷了我的支票，说三到五个工作日就会退回钱到我账户。结果事情过去了两个月我去了十几次银行催促。先是业务员骗我说疫情原因等两天就到了，后来又说要给我的一封确认信发错邮箱了，发到盗用支票的人哪里，然后告诉我第二天会发，然后又没有，然后就找借口推时间。后来告诉我要等60天，60天不退我钱他赔给我。结果我今天我又打电话，他们告诉我，我的案子已经结束了，告诉我没办法退我钱，而且还不给我服务，也不给我解决问题的方法。这样的银行和强盗有什么区别，如果这件事情就这样结束请问这个国家还有法律与公平吗！？银行真的可以这样为所欲为吗！？< /text>

Amazing! My dogs love it here. The staff is very helpful and attentive to what you want and are looking for. Very receptive to dogs needs. My two don’t do well separated and they always groom them together. 😎❤️<//Review>

Terrible customer service. I got a new puppy and I didn't know anything about dogs, I asked them what collar to get and this heavyset blond woman told me to get this one based on the weight. I asked what food to get for a Poppy, she carelessly said any of these. I got the collar and it didn't fit, I went back ten minutes later and they exchanged it but they would only give me a credit for the rest. The food she recommended made the dog fart all day, I just found out that you are not supposed to feed Poppy's  food with beans it will make them gassy.</Review>

<review>Really friendly staff and very well kept. They have an awesome cookie selection for your pup and offer a great variety of all natural treats for dogs and cats. I would say most of their food selection is of the higher end foods. They offer pet grooming as well. Best part of the store though is the animal they always have up for adoption in front of the store. Just a sweet spot for your pet to visit and look at toys! I highly recommend this place for your animals needs!!<//review>< gmapID>

I love this place. It is the only grooming shop I use for my cat and dog. Melissa is a great groomer and she is very knowledgeable and passionate about the care of every pet! I love the store manager, Andy as well! I’ve always been greeted and serviced with great respect! They work so hard and love what they do.< /Text>

They really try to get you with any addition small service.  I came in for a sanitary trim around the butt area and a trim on the feathers underneath her paw on my australian shepard.  Sanitary trim cost $10 and underneath her paw $5.  She came out with a landing strip and had feathers around the cheeks.  I tried to come back the next day to ask to trim the feathers shorter so she didn't look like she had a landing strip and they wanted to charge me another $5 cuz thats an extra charge they didn't charge yesterday.  You would think when you do a sanitary trim it would all the butt area  and not  get charged per spot.  They should at least been accommodating!!   the trim took all about 10min!!< /Review>< user_id>

Besides the name (which I love) this place is great. An incredible array of toys and treats and prices that won't leave you empty for Christmas shopping! Also, the staff is knowledgeable, personable, and accommodating.

And they have puppies!!!!<//Review>

The staff is absolutely amazing! Best Prices in town for grooming and they are incredibly fast. I use them about 1-2x a month but stop in daily just to say hi to the staff because they are that great! Melissa does such an awesome job grooming my overly excited lab who pees when he is excited. Anybody who knows labs knows that it’s pretty much constant excitement. I wouldn’t recommend going anywhere else. The staff here is hands down the most caring and easy going staff. Thanks for all you do guys!</Text>

<Text>Awesome premium dog food selections from USA, Canada & New Zealand, as well as pet gear, necessities and fun toys for our pups. Price point is good as is variety and quality. The manager Jeff is a wealth of knowledge and always available to answer any questions we have. Both he and the staff have gone the extra mile for us, even helping us to our car with heavy bags of dog food. They've taken good care of our "boys" when there for a grooming. LOVE the location! Located in the heart of downtown San Diego's "Little Italy" neighborhood, it's a fav trendy spot to eat, shop and walk around. There's even a great doggie park for the boys!<//Text>< pics>

Jeff was extremely helpful during the adoption process of Riley.
I will always refer friends and family to DSP for all their pet needs.
I have taken Riley to multiple shops for grooming and no one makes him feel as comfortable as the Doggie Style Family!
Thanks Everyone for the awesome customer service!</Text>

Doggy style has a great selection of items for dogs, the store normally has a dog on adoption in the store too although last time we went he has already been adopted.

They also do a bunch of both cat toys and foods.

The staff are helpful but not pushy.</Text>

<review>I've been going here since they opened but all of my favorite employees have been disappearing. All these men they have been hiring don't know anything about pet food, my dog has allergies and they told me the opposite of what I should be doing. They are also very rude. Their groomer left and went up two blocks to their competition, which says a lot. Now I have no reason to return again.< /review><user_id>101574517665576353608</user_id>< rate>

<review>All I can say is WOW! Juan was professional, knowledgeable and HONEST! I am very particular and expect quality work. He told me what my car needed done, what he could and could not to do. When I went in to check out the final job I was beyond satisfied!!! My 2002 Honda Accord looks brand new again. I couldn’t be any happier than I am right now with my experience with Maaco. Thank you Juan. The world needs more people like you!<//review>< pics>

<review>Just got a guote to paint our 20 year old truck with spray in bed liner. Hoping to love it! Do you know most auto body places will not paint a whole vehicle?

Ok, took our truck there, they did an incredible job, great customer service! They even took it to someone to put in a new headliner and visors, color was perfect, great job, thank you so much for the great service. Price was also good.<//review>< response>

<Review>I had been in an accident not long ago and it was considered a total loss even though the other driver was at fault so we didn't have much to fix all the damage only a small portion of and they were not only understanding but professional and helped us right away by fixing the body around the tire that had been scraping at a very reasonable price, we can drive the car now without issue and even have some money left over to show for it. Special thanks to the manager and workers who helped us</Review>< Time>

Amazing work on our 1971 VW bus. They did some major and minor body work and repainted it in and out, it looks amazing!  Quick turn around considering the amount of work done.  Go with them and you won’t be disappointed  Thank you!</Text>

<review>My Mitsubishi Outlander Sport needed my roof painted black and small dings painted white around the car. When I dropped it off, the Estimator and I walked around the suv and he circled all the dings that had to be fixed. When the suv was done, my wife came to pick up her car and her battery was dead. The Maaco rep didn't show my wife the painted areas that were done and my wife felt rushed off the property. I was out of town for a month for work. I get home from being away and there were two dings that were missed and there was a dent on rear side top next to the black painted roof. It looks like someone had there body weight on the side roof when painting the roof. I called to have someone look at on a Saturday and they couldn't accept my car because PG&E was working in front of the store and was keeping them closed. That was the only time I could bring it. Now I have wait another month. My wife feels uncomfortable there and won't go there and she doesn't have a back up car. I dont think I would have been treated that way if I showed up.</review>< response>

You can tell that management puts emphasis on putting the customer customer first, which seems to be as important as quality of service they provide for your vehicle. If I ever need body work, I will come back to this establishment.< /text>

Overall good paint job. Imperfections as expected. Paint match was different and moderate overspray/ paint runs on body section. Body repair not completely repaired as noted. Overall 3/5... 👍🏻</Review>

They did such a great job. Other places were quoting me over 1,000 for a dent on the hood, and they did the work for way less than that. I was worried the quality wouldn’t be as good but my car looks almost new. Amazing job and got it done fast!<//Review>

Great experience with them. They left my car looking amazing! They were a few days late on the deadline but it was worth it!

<Date>1599558992103< /Date><rating>1< /rating><text>They told us it will look "Red and close to my other cars paint but maybe a little brighter or a little darker"  well turns out they gave us a different whole color. I made sure to let every employee know before we left that we want a red, don't care what red as long as its as close as they can make it to my other car that was bright red. I know it would not be exactly the same but come on this one was really dark and brown not even red. I paid $1,100 for something I did not asked they couldn't call me letting me know it wont be what I expected so I can choose a different color, they had to see it before spraying it on the car makes no since. I feel like I got scammed from my hard earned money. I do not recommend going here.
(EDIT) I have sent them a message on email and called support, have not received a email back or a call back and they told me they will call me back.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I brought my car in Monday and got it back Wednesday. I got it back before scheduled time. This is my third time here, different cars & different types of paint jobs depending what happened to my car. Work turned out great. Excelent customer service.I would definitely recommend my friends & family members.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Took my car in for new body parts and full body painting, after a minor accident. They did an excellent job in welding the back door and wheel arch panel. What I loved most was their pricing for a factory finish  paint job, which includes a 5 yr warranty.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>During my early twenties I was a little reckless with my car and got into a couple fender benders that made my car look like I lost a fight with a can opener. I’ve been trying to save for the past couple years to finally get the damage fixed. I went to Neira’s and they were going to charge me $7000. I decided to go to Maaco where I spoke to Muhammad for a second opinion. He was extremely helpful, understanding, and nice. He took a look at my car and gave me the price saving me about $3,000. Considering the damage done to my car they got it done quickly. It took 2 weeks exactly. When I got the first look at my car I couldn’t believe it was the same one. I am beyond ecstatic about how it turned out. I would highly suggest you go here if you’re like me and want to return your car back to its former glory without paying and arm and both legs. I can’t thank these guys enough for the amazing job they did!!!<//Text>< Pics>

Mohammed and his staff did an awesome and amazing paint job on our 2001 Toyota Mr2 Spyder👌 . What an amazing difference we just love you the new look. If you haven’t given Maaco a call I would, why spend money buying a new car when you can give your current vehicle a new car look👍. Check them out they are very very friendly and great customer service👌. Thank you again.♥️ Arturo & Gloria Galvan</Text>

Amazing job for the price. Picked the cheapest package and everything came out amazing. They even fixed my dent perfectly, couldn’t even tell there use to be one. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a budget paint job or just a paint job in general.</text>

<text>My car was painted exactly the color I wanted & the staff couldn’t have done a better job! I am blow away! Unfortunately my car was keyed/scratched after the paint job was done but to no fault of Maaco, it just happened in a Walmart parking lot.
Anyways, the value and job well done is so worth it to have my car all pretty and painted!
Thanks Maaco! I’ll definitely be sharing my experience with others!!<//text><Response>{'time': 1593725372404, 'text': "Thank you for the review, Emily! We're glad to hear you had a great experience with our team."}< /Response><Pics>None< /Pics>< rating>

Overall I’m really happy with how my F-350 turned out. This was a complete strip, primer, and paint job. I had a little cracking in my paint right at a year and Muhammad took care of it with no issues. It’s one thing to paint something, it’s another thing to stand behind it.</Text><username>Garrett Zander</username><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<rate>5</rate><review>After hearing so many negatives about Maaco I decided to go in and talk to them.  Hector explained the whole process to me and gave me the confidence to go ahead with the paint job.  These guys went the extra mile for me in finding and mixing the color I was looking for and overall did an excellent job.  Yeah, there were a few dust bunnies but most of those came out in the polishing.  My race car looks great!  Thanks again to the team at Maaco on Ming.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuMH7RZkGTROHKbFyc3RR5tkPzYiZSjMTAOlMG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I took my mustang there which was almost wrecked after an accident. I thought the repairs would cost over my budget. I went to this establishment and was greeted quite hospitably. They were understanding of my situation and gave me a great estimate. I thought my car was at least gonna be there around a month but I picked it up almost last week!! My car was as good and new and I was able to drive it again.<//Text>

<text>GOOD PEOPLE. QUALITY VALUE. SKILLFUL WORK. I am one of those people who resisted getting my old truck repainted, because how could the new be as nice as the factory paint? I am impressed. The service was top notch--from explaining exactly what my vehicle needed and why (including what it didn't need), being flexible with my schedule, sticking to their stated time table, following up on questions when I called in, and above all, returning my truck in AMAZING condition. I love my truck, but it was definitely in need of work....the staff here went above and beyond my expectations. Their work impressed many skeptical people who know cars and knew what I had given Macco to work with. Mohammed's team masked the two-toned paint job very well (beautiful finish work), and did a better job than more expensive paint jobs I have seen other people get.
I highly recommend Bakersfield Maaco. Mohammed's prices are very competitive/fair, the shop is professional, and his workers are a skilled team. Thank you guys so much!!!</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>If you need a quick, cheap, paint job this is your place. I went into this knowing the low quality of Maaco paint shops. I also didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a paint job on an 18 year old vehicle with 200K miles on it. I got what I paid for and I’m satisfied with it. If you want a great, long lasting paint job, take it to Niera’s.... Be advised, it will cost you 4K plus there, where I paid a third of that at Maaco....</review><resp>None</resp><username>William Johnson< /username><date>1568478422098< /date>< user_id>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Brought my car in to replace damage done to the trunk of my vehicle. After the repair, my car was returned with part of the tint on my back passenger window scratched off and the back passenger lock is now broken. The door is unable to be opened from the inside. Also when screwing a part of my door back on, they used a different screw from what was previously in my car and they lost the screw cover. It is strange that this even occurred to the passenger side because my original damage wasn't on that part of the vehicle.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Such a great honest shop!! I had some light scratches on my vehicle that I figured could just be buffed out, so I took it to a local shop that said they would have to completely repaint that side of the vehicle and it would cost me 700 dollars! I was so worried, but when I took it to Maaco the owner assured me they could buff and polish the area for 65 bucks! And it came back perfect!! The whole experience was so easy and all the workers were kind and me and my boyfriend had a great conversation with the owner while the work was getting completed. I highly recommend this shop for any repairs or paint jobs you might need. We will definitely be bringing our cars to them!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<text>I was rear ended recently, mostly cosmetic damage, We were sent to Maaco by a friend who owns a business in town and who uses Maaco for all their paint work. Mohammad greeted me and took a look at the car. He explained exactly how much the work would cost and when it could be completed. We took the car in on the appointed day and the work was done as promised; the car looks fabulous! Such a great experience, we highly recommend Maaco on Ming Ave!< /text>< Date>

The staff was extremely helpful and caring throughout the process of painting and repairing our vehicle.  They went the extra mile to acquire the parts needed, and worked within our budget.  The car looks great.</text>

I was a bit skeptical on bringing my car here. It was a White Chevy Malibu. Due to some bad reviews I was hesitant on having them repair my car. After looking around town I finally decided to go through Maaco disregarding the bad reviews and focusing on the good reviews and gave them a chance. May I say that was the best decision I made! Not only was my car fixed in every detail but it was on time! They did an amazing job and will surely recommend family and friends.< /Review>

I was on my way to SFO from Nevada and my car's bumper was broken near Bakersfield. By google, I found Maaco Bakersfield and visited there. They really provided me very satisfactory service in a very adequate time and price. I appreciate their service and customers' satisfaction approach.</Text>

Mohammed at Maaco, was so awesome again.  I got my car painted for a very reasonable price.  Their work there is the best in town.  They also are very fast and efficient.  Thanks for making my car fantastic again, so that I don't feel bad about the outside, when I am driving in it.  :)

Maaco is awesome.  This is the best Maaco I have ever gone to.  Mohammed is so kind and caring of customers.  Also, Hector is great too.  They take care of you here, like you are family.  You would not know that I was in a crash where my bumper was busted and my head light was damaged as well.  I was feeling low and missing my car, but then when I got it back... WOW!! My daughter loves it too.  She says, "Mommy's car is not broken anymore."  So if you ever need even an estimate on painting or definitely fixing your car... They are the BEST in town for sure.  You all have a great day.< /text>

I took my Subaru when I got into an accident a couple of months ago and they did a great job the paint quality was on point and the customer service they provided was awesome. The best part was that they helped me with my deductible, I didn't have to pay anything out of pocket. Over all great experience I would definitely recommend this place.< /Review>

<date>1518205377451</date><review>I wanted to give my boyfriend a gift for Christmas. He has this 20 year old Toyota truck that he loves but it needed some TLC. After calling many other establishments, I found MAACO. I talked Hector and he set the whole thing up, keeping my secret until Christmas. When we took the truck in for the new paint, the staff was so nice. The customer service at the Bakersfield MAACO is the best. They even refinished the bumpers and all of the trim - without charge - the truck looks like new. Thank you MAACO
Happy customer.</review>< gmapID>

<Text>When they tell you that your vehicle will be done on a specific date, go ahead and add like a week to that, and that’s when you’ll have your car back. Very Unsatisfying when we all need our vehicles on a daily basis for work, running errands and emergencies, Etc.< /Text>< pictures>

I called this gas station after I went to another gas station down the road because it was too packed and the male employee that answered the phone didn't listen to what I was telling him. He became defensive when I expressed my concern and hung the phone up on me. I simply wanted to warn them of a skimming problem but he told me it was my problem because he only works inside of the store. I once worked with the owner of this store years back and she would not have approved of this behavior. Maybe his behavior means he is part a skimming ring. I would avoid this gas station at all cost.< /text>< Pics>

This is a remote destination for travelers on interstate 5 and they have a sign clearly posted on the door with the insidiously gleeful message "restroom for customers only, your purchase is your key". If this was an inner city location to curb camping or something like that I would understand but to intentionally deny a restroom when you are already making heaps of $ just to ensure every person entering the establishment is a customer. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. I turned around as soon as I read the sign.< /Review>

The lady working was extremely abrupt and rude. The poor guy working with her acted scared to even speak. I don't come through her very often, but if I did I'd make sure to go to a different gas station/ convenience store.<//Text>

STAY AWAY !  workers unfriendly just look at all the unprofessional handwritten signs on door. They are too lazy to clean bathrooms and often just put up a closed sign when they are not even cleaning. Most other stations and Bravoland are clean and friendly just not the Shell food mart.</Text>

Busy place as it is at a major freeway exchange.
I found this place to be clean and we'll stocked of goods and gas prices reasonable.
When I paid for my goods and gas at the counter I was greeted by the most friendly hostess that gave me some helpful advice on my purchases.
At the pumps the window washing stations were we'll stocked with towels and clean washing liquid.
This was a very pleasant visit and I will most certainly stop here again.<//review>

They sell gas, or try to ... the pump I pulled into had both the buttons that are required to select if your card is a debit card or not destroyed. The bathrooms are sub par enough that I wouldn't bring my kids in there. All in all, this is an old gas station that desperately needs an good cleaning and upgrade.</review>

<Text>Stopped for the bathroom, which only had two working stalls and was so dirty. Attendants behind the counter could care less there was no toilet paper. Out of order signs on almost every dispenser (soda, coffee, water, etc.) Handmade price signs on the merchandise charging $5-6 more than normal.  Choose another station at this exit, I am sure there would be better service.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Station pumps out of gas except premium. No signs people at pumps trying to get gas. Employees say we won't put up signs because we do not know when the gas truck will arrive in the meantime customers lining up to find out why the gas pumps won't work.

8/6/19

I decided to rewrite my review for this nail salon because although at times humor is definitely the best medicine to cheer yourself up after…it’s not the best way to show you that you should stay away from this place at all costs.

I went in with my mother and we both wanted pedicures. After a few minutes of waiting, we finally got a seat at the massage chairs. My mother and I both got male “nail techs” or whatever they want to pass themselves off as.

I was sitting and the man handed me a laminated paper with the different pedicure packages and their prices. I decided to go with the package that has the basics and only the callus remover which was supposed to be $30. So, I told the man that was what I wanted. The time before I came, I got a gel pedicure, so the man noticed and tried to convince me not once, not twice…not three times but FOUR times for me to get gel and blah blah blah. I totally get how upselling works, but if a customer says no—multiple times. It means no. To add, because he knew I had gel previously, he bumped up my price $5 more to remove my gel polish??? I’m sorry…what? So if that weren’t frustrating enough, the man who was working on my toes decided to bump down my package to the basics but instead of the callus remover, he did the paraffin wax. As someone who is working at a place…it is NOT your place to downgrade your paying customer to something they didn’t originally ask for. This new package was going to cost $28.

So he begins using cotton pads to remove the gel off of my toes, and he maybe let the solution on the pads sit for about 30 seconds. Then he took off the pads from my toes and began aggressively filing off the polish from my toes with so much force. For time sake, I am going to put the actual part that made me literally scream.

The nail tech goes to the back and brings back the hot towels and the paraffin wax. He then he proceeds to grab the paraffin wax bags and doesn't even feel it, but by the way he was handling the bags, I had a feeling the wax was VERY hot. And he stuck my foot in there and it was indeed WAY too hot. I told him multiple times that it was very hot and clearly from my sudden reaction and repetition, everyone around me saw my reaction and saw that this was no laughing matter. He proceeded to press in the paraffin wax to form my foot. What upset me beyond belief was the fact that this man literally told me, “No it’s not hot….no it no burn…” Are you kidding me?? Are you really trying to ignore my blatant cries and tell me that you did not just burn me??? By this point, I was very very close to tears. I don't even think he was able to handle the heat from the plastic bags because he turned on the cool water and pushed my foot down forcefully in there. After about a couple of minutes, he proceeded to put my right foot into a different bag with wax. This one was manageable unlike the first time. After some time passed, he came back and took the bags off of my feet and all of the toes on my left foot were very pink and were in so much pain. He began aggressively massaging that specific foot because he too, must have saw how horribly pinkish red they were. I felt my toes becoming almost numb and hot. ***** I also have attached a picture of both of my feet, where you can visibly see my left toes were burnt and inflamed. *******

It truly disgusts me that this man tried to tell me otherwise that he did not burn me. My point is, nail techs need to understand that they are not working on wax figures or whatever, these are real people that they are working on and they can cause real damage to their customers. I will never be stepping foot at this nail salon again.</review>

<review>I have enjoyed going there many years. Always friendly and helpful. Vivian knows exactly how I like my nails and I need to remember that and let her do her thing. Appointments can be made if your in a hurry but I don’t mind waiting, it give me a chance to decide what I want.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I came back after a year  in hopes the attitude and favoritism was different. Two people were waiting for pedicures i wanted a full set it went from a very right with you to oh it'll be an hour.  I left and went to Lucky Spa Nails and they did an amazing job as well as was so friendly when I walked in....I'll never as long as I'm stationed here come back to this overly priced rude place</review><resp>None<//resp>< name>

I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS NAIL SALON AGAIN!!!!!!!!!! I went here yesterday 6/9/19 to get a pedicure but was in a rush and ended up asking to just polish my toes. The person helping me suggested gel polish because it dries faster so I went ahead with the gel polish from a book she showed me some colors, the polish I got looks nothing like the polish color I had chosen still I didn’t want to be rude so I just keep quite.. after charging me $25 for the polish application I payed with my credit card and left a $3 tip. Today I checked my account activity and came to find out that I was charged $30 and not the $ 28 it was suppose to be.. I even wrote it on the cc slip, I know $2 it’s not a big deal but that’s only from me I wonder how many other ppl they over charge and they don’t notice it or let it go but every dollar adds up so please check your cc statements and don’t fall victim to them..<//text>

Great place and very friendly staff. The prices here are very reasonable and the interior is spotless. The manicure and pedicure are wonderful and people are very professional. Basically that's all I need.
I would definitely recommend this place to my friends!<//Text>

Very clean and detail-oriented! The owner is super sweet and both technicians worked really well. I got a gel manicure and pedicure along with an eyebrow waxing and was extremely pleased with the results after trying a few different places and moving to a new neighborhood. Good prices and I am definitely making this my next regular spot.<//Review>

I paid for a $43 pedicure and also decided to get gel on my toes as well making it a $58 pedicure. This was by far the fastest pedicure I have ever received. There was no foot massage what so ever, even though that specific pedicure states a 15 minute massage and my nails look sloppy and not fully polished. Not happy with their service what so ever.<//Review>

After reading the reviews on this place I was really skeptical about going here (everyone else was booked tho) so I gave it a try and I'm so glad I did!! Atmosphere was nice, the woman who did my pedicure was awesome and knew what she was doing. Prices are fair. I got one of the best callus scrubs so far here. If only I did a before and after lol but overall good place. Definitely coming back.< /Review>

I came in here with my friend to get my nails done . When we walked in we were greeted and Tina told us to sit while choosing our colors. This place provided a lot of colors . Tina and the other lady I had was very nice and they understood what I wanted . I eventually chose the acrylics with gel polish. That night, one of my nails were bothering me because of the tip being slightly lighter. This wasn't something noticeable but my ocd kicked in. I messaged Tina about it and she was very understanding and immediately asked when I was free during the day. The service was great. I would definitely come back for a fill. Thank you Tina and team.<//Review>

I love this place! They're always friendly and I never have to wait long. It's nice and clean and their quality of work is great.
This is the place you want to go if you want a no nonsense mani pedi. They did a nice job and get people in and out quickly. Prices are reasonable as well.</text>

<review>The first time I went, they guy i had did a good job. Only thing I was unhappy about was the callous removal. This last time I went was horrible. The guy cut my big toe, polish was so sloppy to the point where the nail tech beside him went back over a few toes after he left me to dry. On top of that, my polish didn't even last a week! I've never had toenail polish chip off after a week. It's usually very hard to get off actually. I will not be returning!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I used to come here all the time but took a break for a bit. When I returned recently, I noticed that some of the staff had changed and the prices went up. Not a huge deal so I went ahead and had several appointments. The quality of work was just not good but I gave it a couple more chances and well, today I popped my acrylics off because I had mold underneath. I've never had that issue before and am mortified. I will not go back and I would not recommend this place to others.<//review>

<text>Worst set of acrylics I have ever had done! Had an appointment and still took almost 3 hours. The person kept leaving while they were doing my nails to take care of other people... every nail has slant on the right side and straight on the left and the gel polish is spottie. The person missed a lot of spots with the acrylic and when I pointed it out they just made excuses. Got my eyebrows waxed and told the lady they were uneven she kept trying to correct and they look horrid... NEVER will I go back.< /text>< GmapID>

Went to go get my nails done, I was assigned to a seat right away. The man that did my nails was kind of rude when he talked. While the man was doing my nails, two other mens came and was just standing there watching. Kind of made me uncomfortable. Poor customer services. Overall my nails came out good.< /review>

I got a french manicure here, so the guy does the white line on the top and gives me one coat of clear nail polish and mishe's spots on my nail, I asked him to give me another coat of clear nail polish,  and he told me it was $5 more.. for a top coat? I told him you missed a spot ..overall he did a good job other than that, the place is small it's always crowed most likely will have to wait a while and put your name on a list. I've gotten my eyebrows done here as well and the lady truely did an amazing job didn't make them too thin just as I asked they came out perfect.</Review>

<review>I gave this place a try and I’m very disappointed with the results.  The man used a very abarsive file on my natural nails and left every one of them looking awful and at a huge slant.  The gel polish was done poorly.  It was messy and uneven and he left blobs cured to my finger and edges of my nails.  I had to call over another tech to come fix it up a bit.  I still wasn’t happy with the fix and had to spend quite a bit of time at home fixing the poor filing job.  I will not be going back.< /review><Gmap_id>0x8094c0990dd9a0c9:0x8808dc9a1a952277< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Bad experience- I’ve been to many many salons in California, Minnesota, Louisiana and Oregon - this one the worse by far - cut my thumb when trimming my cuticles - no apology - neglected to put a topcoat on my left hand! When I returned the following day to have the coat added - again no apology!</review>

A different person then came over and tried to put gel nail polish over an open cut, which fell off almost immediately after I left, and I still had to pay full price for the manicure!.  Not the first time this place has disappointed me.  I will not be going back.</review></record>

<Review>I walked in and there were two ladies in front of me. After the guy asked what they needed he yelled across the room to me, "what about you?" Idk about y'all, but I think that's rude. They sit me down in a chair for my pedicure(#3 to be specific) and the massage balls in the back of the chair were stuck on the lower back. I asked the lady how to move the massage up and she said "oh yeah that chair is broke" then why would you sit a customer there? She grabbed a small pillow to put between my back and the massage chair. I then asked if they had another chair that worked properly and she said yes and moved me to the one on the very end (all staff began talking in a language and laughing as soon as I asked to be moved. I'm not even 10 minutes into my pedicure and I am already so dissatisfied.</Review>< Rate>

First person to get my nail polish on my nails, staff was kind and curteous. She cut me once, but I always get cut to all places I go to. So getting cut once is a win!</review>

On 12/10/2016 I had my eyebrow waxed Tina Luu from Super Spa Nails. When I walked into the building I was asked what I needed. I informed them on my needs and Tina said to walk to the back of the building to the room on the left. When I walked in I saw a chair/reclining chair and a bed, I stood there for a few minutes waiting was Tina because I didn’t know if I was to lay down or sit. I couldn’t tell if she was washing her hands or what because she was helping another customer with a pedicure prior to coming into the room. When Tina came in she asked me to lay down and began working on my eyebrows right away without question.  When the process began, I closed my eyes and felt was the hot wax applied first to my right eyebrow. I thought at first that the wax was unusually hot, but dismissed it thinking that I was sensitive to the heat since the last time I had my eyebrows waxed.   As soon as she tore off the first strip from my eyebrow, I just felt a painful burn sensation, but thought it was normal due to the sensitivity previously mentioned.   I noticed that she stopped a few minutes to get cotton and start wiping my eye with some kind of liquid.  I noticed that she did wipe several times then continued on.   After she was done waxing my right eyebrow, she suggested that I get my eyebrows waxed several days prior to my event so that my make-up will blend better with my eyebrows.  I found the suggestion strange because my eyebrows are typically red and irritated after waxing, but not for very long.

Ms. Luu proceeded to work on the other side.  I bared through the pain thinking all is well.  When she was finished I looked my eyebrows and it appeared to be more red than normal and felt very painful.  I went to the lobby area to pay and she suggested to me again to wax my eyebrows days before so it is not red.  As soon as I walked out and felt the cold air on my face, the painful burn increased.  I rushed to my car thinking it all just normal and drove away. While driving I couldn’t bare the intense pain and looked to see what was wrong.  As I looked in the mirror I saw the redness of the burnt areas with missing pieces of my skin from the waxed areas.  My skin felt raw.  I saw piece of cotton stuck on the raw area and wiped off the piece of lint. When I looked at that piece of lint it was reddish pink and appeared to be blood stain.  I rushed home and had my husband take pictures immediately.
Since it was already later in the evening and I still couldn’t fully see the extent of the damage this person had done, I went to my event.  After getting home I washed my face avoiding the affected areas as much as I could and treated the affected areas with Neosporin.  On Monday 12/12, I missed work to go see my primary doctor. She confirmed that my face was burned and skin was ripped off from the burn.  She referred me to the Dermatologist who I saw later on that day. The dermatologist gave me 1 cream for the burn and an ointment to keep infection away and suggested a sunblock with high SPF so minimize the sun damage in that area.

I called and went the establishment on Monday 12/12 to make them aware of the situation and to get the license of the esthetician, which was Tina Luu, License Number Z92180. I was told that the manager Vicki is not back until Wednesday, 12/14. She called me on Tuesday 12/13 and apologized about the situation and was told that Tina will not be waxing and that this is not the first time she had done this. Vicki, the manager, stated to me that Tina had the same incident happen to another client before. The manager Vicki was rude, questioning the doctor and dermatologist of their diagnosis and said that I would have just give you a cream. My medical insurance claimed the injury and this nail spa refuse to pay back my insurance company. Vicki refused to give me their insurance information to claim my medical bills.</Text>

< Review>
I’ve been to this place since 2012 and earlier. The food is nice and all but restrooms are kind of messy sometimes. They also don’t have sockets, so don’t expect to plug those in. The management is very nice and in my years I have not had a problem. The area gets shady at night, so I don’t recommend going at night, its best to go around 4-7 PM.< /Review>

<Review>I'm from Bakersfield and I have to say it's a gorgeous, spacious well kept McDonald's. My order was quick and the servers were kind but I have to say it looked like they just threw my filet o fish sandwich in the box . I've never had to unstick the cheese from the bread to straighten it to that extent.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Today I went for the hunting  eggs at McDonald  I notice.  At the time of the raffles. The staff from McDonald's family was winning the prices, I saw all those poor kids jumping to win something but they only have one ticket and they never win. But the staff family had like ten tickets per person  so they win all the prices. I ask one  of the supervisor  why those people had 20 ticket and she laughed  at me and said oh because she had 20 kids. I wish somebody stop and do something for those kid, they deserve  to have the opportunity  to take a toy home.</text>

The employees are always so friendly and helpful to me.  Today there was a line at the counter so the manager herself showed me how to use the kiosk to order.  She was very patient with me, and helped me through the steps.</Text>

😒 it's not that great. The food hardly ever taste fresh && they usually mess up drive-thru orders. I had stopped going for a good while because I was annoyed with there service . The service is usually better in the morning. It's rare when they slide the window open and say " good morning or good afternoon " ...</Review>

<rating>2<//rating><text>It's McDonald's. The food is exactly what you'd expect... when these fools manage to get your order right. It's ridiculous how often they screw up simple orders. Like a double quarter pounder with no onions. I got a single quarter pounder with onions but no pickles. Stupid mistakes like this are the norm for this location. I stopped going to this one because of how often they get an order wrong.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>On 4/15/18 @ 8:00 as I got there iI See the night shift manager and another worker that were going to give out a Happy meal order with toy that had fell on the ground and manager picked it up and threw it in the happy meal box Wich had food in it already and we're going to serve it like that to a customer, it's sad how even that manager couldn't do the right thing and be a role model for the other employees, I called them out on itt just to get bad faces in return and a half full $3× fries  it was a terrible experience all the mistakes I seen that night and bad faces that were made at me while waiting for my order it was horrible the cashier was nice tho and showed her sympathy for what I was going threw with the manager and other staff......before this experience it was good tho......I only go there cuz my kids like the layground and when my kids want their happy meals Wich they love....< /Text>< pics>
