It was delicious and hit the spot perfectly after my morning walk to get there. I loved having an electrical outlet at my table with USB ports in it as well, that hooked me!

<Review>Ordered online on their website and my order was ready for pickup right on time

I heard how good this place was so I just had to give it a try and OMG Its even better than I expected

Will definitely be returning soon especially since ordering and picking up is a breeze

(I ended up going back the same day 😂😂😂) it was so good!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4wxfmObhiv4BFYOmAHSh9gzVzbMBmSeN1LoEp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM0XST-rP8sWHichzwsCmxf51fDWa8riue7_k7f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

I've been coming here since last summer and I still love it. My favorite is their acai bowls! I've also tried the dragon bowl. Super refreshing and healthy treat :)

It would be nice of they had more beverage options or displayed them better. The chips stand seems out of place to me and doesn't go with their healthy scene. Also sad to see the outdoor seating is gone. Music choice is interesting. Bachata and acai bowls? Heyyyyy<//text>

Every time I have come here to order the staff tells me it will be 15-20min for my order. It really is ridiculous. They said it is so busy, but there was one person in the place. I don’t see how this place will stay open when they keep turning away business.<//Review>

< Review>
Be prepared to wait..a long time. I've only been here twice and both times I've waited between 20-30 minutes for a bowl and a juice. The first time, it was only a sandwich and still waited 20 minutes. That is completely unacceptable.

I have no idea what is happening behind the double doors, but I see at least 2-3 people back there. Unless you're going into a secret orchard to pick these fruits, it shouldn't take more than 10-15(MAX) minutes for any of what's on the menu. You're better off going to Jamba Juice, it'll taste the same.< /Review>

The sign outside said panini 5.99 with any bowl, false advertising.  She could not find the discount on the register.  Don't advertise if tout can't train the employees how it works 😢</Review>

Also, the service leaves a lot to be desired. I know it's a chain, but whether the place is busy or dead, it always seems like it takes 15-20 minutes to get my food even when they're fully staffed. Last time I was there, a guy before me had been waiting to receive his food. An employee came from the kitchen and put a to-go bowl in the fridge where ready orders go. Then five minutes later another employee came out, saw the order in the fridge, and gave the waiting man his food. Seems super inefficient and like the staff doesn't communicate. I'll be back but am disappointed in the service overall.</text><username>Tim Turi<//username><Time>1503297072889< /Time>< response>

<review>Great menu options - you can get a wide variety of things, depending on how healthy you want to eat. If you're into sweet stuff, they have acai dessert bowls with chocolate and strawberries, or nut bowl with peanut butter, honey and bananas. But they have tons of healthy options too - bowls and smoothies with spinach, kale, bee pollen, etc. My favorite thing on the menu by far is Dragon Bowl with pitaya, kiwi, mango juice, bananas, and more.

Taking one star off, as the place is clearly unorganized. I have been asked to pay for an order I have already paid online, and more than I can count I got coconut shavings in my bowls, when I have clearly asked for no shavings.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808fa3ad2ef1a303:0x94ed9cf962702c18< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This Bakery is Amazing. Friendly Staff and  delicious Pan dulce ( Sweet Bread) & Canela (a cinnamon drink that you add cream and sugar to). They also have, Coffee, Fruit Parfaits and Tres Leche Cake & a few other things that I have not tired but, will eventually. I usually go here with My Pop and we always get our canela & pan dulce.<//Review>< user_id>

The pan dulce is kind of bland the cashier has a bad attitude and the owner is always raising prices with the price you would think the beard would be delicious and they still charge a 50c fee for using a debit card 🤢🤢<//Text>

<Text>A small, yet homey place with a wide variety of sweet breads to choose from. It always smells so good in there. They constantly have fresh breads. My favorite is their bread with cream cheese and jalapeno. The bread is so soft and you get a good kick from the jalapeno. Highly recommend this panaderia.< /Text><user_id>108325817497759181700</user_id><resp>None</resp>< date>

We finally went in. The staff was absolutely friendly and as welcoming as can be. The shop was cozy. We got a good deal of food and it didn't come out to too much. The prices are great and it ended up being absolutely delicious. This will become a monthly visit for us from now on!< /Text></record>

Great Bread! I just went in today and noticed that they now have espresso drinks! How great! Tried a medium white chocolate mocha for only ($3.25 on special right now) and let me tell you, it was delicious! I would recommend this place to everyone!</review>

Except here they bake fresh bread every morning and at food 4 less you'll get hard bread which is like half the size of the one at cypress< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Excellent pan . All the bread is always fresh, made daily and often.  Not like in other places that bread is a bit hard and old,  they are a good size too for the price no small like other bakeries . Everytime we go is full of people and a lot of pan is gone you need to get at the right time . If you want hot bolillos get there about 7:00 pm  is when is hot and ready. Every time that we want mexican pan we only go there . Is a bit of a drive I live by Cosco but is worth the drive.<//text>< user>

<review>Their Bakery is not bad they need to carry more baked goods that was the only thing that I saw there was some things that I could not to get there but everything else was good if you want something sweet that would be a place to go in the morning to get yourself something and a cup of coffee< /review>< Pics>

Disappointed, after going there a few times. I bought a gallon of milk in addition to the bread to save time, but when I got home I noticed that the milk was past due and was rotten. Granted this came from their milk supply, makes me concerned if they would use such product and we wouldn't even know.<//Text>

I am new to Vista and walked in as I was exploring the neighborhood. The Wait was minimal, the location was clean and covid safe. Was greeted and helped by Jennifer (owner/manager?). She was incredibly friendly, welcoming and authentically kind. She helped make me feel comfortable and welcome to the neighborhood. I highly recommend this location for the great customer service and feeling of Community. Thanks!!! ❤️<//review>

I highly advise anyone who cares for how their hair looks, don't go here. I bid you warning. I brought my daughter here to get her bangs trimmed and a wash. I waited for nearly 40 minutes while the lady brushed her hair for over half the time, then was charged $26... For a trim and a wash. A simple day turned complex thanks to No Great Clips. I will not be returning and my recommendation is that everyone do the same and stay far away from this true to life "Chop Shop". I will be following up with a manager and potentially the store owner.< /review>

I wish I could give zero stars. My hair was butchered. I had long thick hair and it was thinned to oblivion and the “layers” were just steps in my hair. Horrible job. I had been coming here for 7 years and never coming back.</review>

My first time was just as salons could open & needed to return when the second Covid salon closure happened. My hair and my luck aren't running positively. The salon artist that cut my hair that one time was Jennifer & I'm so impressed with what she did! I told how I liked it & she not only listened to me, but heard me as well! It was not only perfect but understood where I am trying to go with it enough to influence the cut! I'm waiting for them to open again because I've chosen my go-to salon artist......and I didn't pay a fortune for a haircut I hated!!! The salon is in a nice area, very clean & very professional! This chain & their artists are underrated, as far as I'm concerned.<//text>

<review>I have been wanting to write this review for the past couple months since the reopening after the lockdown. Before COVID I used to love going to this place. It was so great that I would always tip $20 for a single haircut. I always appreciated the friendly atmosphere. I even have a family of 6 that I would take here regularly. Along with all the other friends and family that I would recommend this place to.

Ever since the lockdown happened and some of the original barbers left (Edgardo), the place has been pretty disappointing. The friendly greeting you receive when you first walk in is gone. The manager in particular, although she has cut my hair well in the past, is not a friendly lady. Not a single smile. I just got a haircut this past weekend and the first thing she told me to to was sit on the side. If I wasn't desperate for a quick cut I would have walked right out. I will not be visiting this location anymore. Send this to your CEO so he/she can revamp your operations.< /review>< pictures>

I went in for an adjustment, nervously hoping that someone can fix another hairstylists mistake.
I was referred to Alexis, she was SO sweet and kind! She fixed my hair and gave me exactly what I wanted and more! I am extremely relieved and I love my hair cut so much!
I will be going here from now on & requesting her!</Text>

<Name>big G villarreal<//Name><review>I went to get my hair cut at santa fe and sanmarcos blvd location. Across the street north of sanmarcos high school.The man cutting my hair was friendly, professional and fast. So fast in fact that i didn't get his name. My haircut was ,$10.00 and i was so impressed by this asian gentleman that i gave him a $5.00 tip. The place looked medium small but very clean. The only thing i did not like is their app which u can download on googleplay. It does not work properly.as soon as you start putting your info down the app goes offline. And yes i did tell them about it.they said they would fix that.I feel this the best place to get a good haircut and not have to pay $50 to $100 bucks for it!< /review></record>

<Text>This place is really helpful because they remember what your haircut was last time, so if you're like me and get usually the same thing every time you don't need to memorize all of the numbers because they already have it on their computer system! Also every time I've been there all of the workers there are kind and fun to talk to while you are getting your hair cut! :) Whenever I need to get a haircut great clips is my first choice!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
This was one of the worst haircuts my boyfriend had EVER gotten! The 2 workers were extremely rude and trying to hustled my whole family into getting a hair cut. I wish I got the stylists name because her customer service sucks. As my boyfriend was trying to tell her that she was not doing what he asked she immediately got offended, said "you just didn't want a hair cut in the first place", then cute a huge chunk out of his hair. These ladies shouldn't even have a job as a hair stylist/cutter.<//Review>

They don't have any consistancy on stylists or Barbers at this place. I've been going for 4+ years and only seen 1 or 2 people stay there for more than 3 months. But they do keep record of your previous hair cut on file which is pretty cool. That's what keeps me coming over again. The place is clean and has a bathroom.< /review>

I believe the woman's name is Teresa. She took the time to cut my hair and I could tell. Some stylists go quick with my hair cause it's so short.

Usually a great place. DO NOT LET LAUREN TOUCH YOUR HAIR! Went in for a trim and she tried to scalp my husband. She thought i wanted him to look like skrillex AND every time she messed up she just kept cutting and cutting and cutting. Like i said, just went in for a trim. Also, she seemed like she had no idea what she was doing and kept asking the Other stylists what she was doing wrong. Other than that it's fast and great. Just the one employee.</Review>

I was afraid of someone messing up my hair since I was going short but she was soo professional and did a great job. I am going back today to get a trip just because she's working today. I highly recommend this place. They did a great job, you can actually check in online, they're fast, & clean. They're also honest and let you know if there's a special.</Review>< gmap_id>

Im very picky when my kids get a cut. I had 2 diff girls for my 2 sons. My oldest had WAY to much taken from his neck i think her name was tracy. My other son had lindsey. She was ok. Its a cheap cut so u get what u pay for.

So i came again and saw a happy hour online...7 PM to 8 pm 9.99$ well i was charged full price for my kids.</Review>

<Text>when i went there, the employees had loud music and their speech was very inaudible. i asked for just a grown out undercut, and they cut everything saying it was more “clean”. i would not recommend this part of the chain to anyone, as they cut via their preference rather than my own.</Text>< pics>

< review>
The ladies who worked there were nice, but they gave me the worst haircut of my life. They tried to give me an A-line cut, but lacked any technique and I ended up with a patch in the back that was way too short and just looks like a chunk of my hair is missing. It is super uneven and the front wasn't even cut at all, so I still have the dead ends I went there with. Instead of it turning out the way it should have, my hair just looks thinner, stringy, messy, and uneven. It looks like my three year old took a pair of scissors to my head. It is super embarrassing to be seen with and now I have to find someone to fix it. What a waste of 16!< /review>

<Review>Absolutely the worst sushi ever. We did all u can eat and ended up cancelling the rest of our order. None of the fish tasted like fish or even fresh. Tasted like it had been shipped from a far off place.or had been frozen and thawed. It also took forever. And it was dead there so not sure why it took so long. Gas station sushi would taste better than this place. I told them we were leaving and to cancel the rest bc it didn't taste good at all. And no apology or orfwer to cut the bill just looks. Definitely a waste of $67. Don't waste your time.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

< review>
I came here for dinner with 15 of our family members as soon as they opened back up (covid) because my Uncle always says how good they are.
I'm not a big sushi eater, maybe once or twice a year. But this is the best sushi restaurant I've been to. We had the avocado rolls, 911 rolls, spicy tuna with avocado, bsc rolls, spicy edamame,  yellowtail, and blue fin. Wow, it was all amazing. I have never eaten this much sushi, but I couldn't stop.
Very friendly staff, but it is not fast food. It takes time for things to come out, so make sure you have time to hang out if you are doing the all you can eat. But definitely worth it.<//review>

First time here for my wife and I and definitely will be back for sure. Service was GREAT!
Even with them needing staff our server Caitlyn, which by the way is new there and still did an outstanding job serving several tables by herself. There was a gentleman who came to help afterwards but overall EXCELLENT fist visit.

Will be back for sure and bring the rest of the family. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!< /text>

<review>I have been to a few sushi restaurant, since I moved here. I started going to Baby Tuna ( Bouquet) because close to my neighborhood . I have since moved to Valencia and not as close. I tried the sushi restaurants by me, I find they are more pricey and you get less? . I have finally went back to Baby Tuna on Copperfield and Bouquet ( closer to my new house) , Less expensive, good quality food and courteous service.  Bouquet used to have a fun Happy hour!</review><username>Lynda Chase</username>< GmapID>

<Text>This is a good, new spot for lighter Asian fare. I went for one of their special poke plates which had salmon, squid, octopus, tuna and yellowtail. The sauce was light and didn't overpower the fish.

The one issue was the timing of the meals coming out. They were busy but one of the six meals never came. Once we brought it up, they rectified it and gave coupons for our next visit. Overall it's a good spot for a change of pace up in the area.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNF9yYt-Q4MgYA5qwHEN-4DAQ3amrzsg5fwsm3O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6kTz5oQac_YOq6kVs7bPQj8sJvEhFEHxpIU-p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1yJi_SmUKFQCuHeOn5bwJTcaXlpsPgPhUEeGT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Rate>

Absolutely LOVE this restaurant so much!!!! Recently went out here with a few friends of mine for dinner, and oh my gosh, everything about it is amazing. The sushi rolls were made just right and were so delicious that I just wanted more (the most authentic sushi to this day), and their mochi ice cream was fantastic (so excited I got to have some!). The waitresses were so polite and friendly that it really made my friends' and my time here more exciting. The overall environment of Baby Tuna is just phenomenal. Would totally come back here again!! 😊< /Review>

<Review>Horrible place! My family came at 6PM and avail of the all you can eat. Order came piece by piece every 30 minutes. We sent our 2nd batch of order realizing that they are slow in preparing the food. Never came. We sent our 3rd order still didnt arrived. Finally we ask the server about our orders and came back to us verifying our order because she said they were confused. After constant follow up the order came out 9:30 PM and I was really trying not to make a comment. Since I already lost my appetite after 3 and half hours of waiting, I was just asking for a box so I can go home since my family is the only one left there and they are already cleaning their store and it seems that their ready to closed. They were arguing with me why i should ask for a box since all the food should be consumed there? They even told me that we ordered a lot? Orders that didnt came out....This place dont have a single cent of customer service! Food not so good either. The only reason people eat there is because of proximity. Nothing else.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

If you want good food and a show, this is the place to go.
My wife and I got to witness a very unhappy customer who had to watch his family eat for 45 minutes while he waited for his food which was given to the wrong table by their waitress.
That same waitress tried to move us from our table even though their was 6 empty tables.
A younger sushi chef yelled at the waitress across the restaurant about her mistakes.
Other than all of that, the food was good.< /review>

By far the best sushi I have had. I did have the all you can eat and I had the pleasure of being served by who I am going to call "80". He blew me away with how he prepared all of my orders. My favorite was the big eye tuna. The Hawaiian roll made me confused for a moment, it was like my brain was saying, is this best ever? Yea, it was. If I get the chance to go back, I will. Beautiful atmosphere. Great Service. Top grade sushi! Thank you Baby Tuna!!!!</text>

Took forever to get our food.  We didn't even get everything we ordered.  Very dissatisfied and disappointed. One of the two chefs needed to stop taking shots with the customers and talking.  The waitresses were such troopers!  They were very apologetic. First and only time I'll ever go there.  Too bad because the food was pretty good.< /Text>

1. We had to ask the waitress 3 times to get a fork
2. 45 minute wait with half empty tables (on 1 occasion) because one of the chefs was  gone
3. Took 10 minutes to get 1/2 of the miso soups we ordered
4. 30 minutes for a california roll and a rainbow roll (california with a variety of fish on top)
5. Seats are ripped
6. All this, while there was only my 3 person group and a couple at the bar.< /text>

<text>The sushi is really good quality. The sushi chef's are really know their craft and are friendly. However the wait staff is bad. They didn't seem to care too much about their jobs nor taking care of their customers. Come to Baby Tuna for the great sushi and sit at the bar. If you sit at a table don't expect much in the way of customer service.</text>< Pictures>

<review>We always have some decent sushi here. The guys working the bar are great and come up with some good off-menu options if you ask. Quick and easy during the week, this family - friendly place gets more crowded and lively on weekend nights.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The sushi, in my opinion, is pretty good. My kids and I love going here and getting the food.  The restaurant is pretty clean but a little chaotic. The chefs behind the bar are very friendly and knowledgeable about the food. But the waiting staff is some of the worst in santa Clarita. They do not answer the phone so good luck ordering take out.  There is one older woman who knows what she is doing but if you get one of the younger girls, good luck.  A visit could last hours while you never get any attention or even sometimes the right order. But the food is good enough that we endure it anyway. If you have the time to think ahead driving over and ordering to go and then going grocery shopping at the Albertsons near by and then picking it up on the way out is probably your best bet.</text>

<Review>Good Sushi, quiet environment. A liittle too many rolls with crab mix, but I understand that's what a lot of the locals like. The wait staff was nice and quick. The yellow tail with Jalepeno and Ponzu is amazing. Will be returning, frequently.< /Review>< Pics>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>We have been here many times... I would say close to 20 maybe more! Never again. It was good for awhile, but it had just taken a bad turn. Repeatedly just very poor customer service. Food quality diminishing. It is such a good location we kept trying again, tonight was final straw. The staff had many obvious friends and family. It's was a a late weeknight so being busy wasn't the problem. We waited forever for everything, our order, our food. We even said don't bring us what we are waiting for, bring us the check. We have been there and tipped 20% plus many times. I hope the staff's friends tip them like that. Never again. It was much better when the owners worked there. Too bad.< /Text>< Pics>

Horrible service, waited over 40 minutes for 2 rolls of sushi for my girlfriend and I. When she brought her roll, it was wrong then it took another 20 minutes to get our dry, saugy poorly put together sushi. We had them put it in a to go container due to the time we spent waiting for the food. Upon arrival we told the waitress that we had waited so long, she passed it off with excuses, laughed and walked away. VERY disappointed in this service. I DO NOT recommend at all. Go to shogun, it’s 10x better<//text>

<Review>I HAVE FOOD POISONING. DO NOT COME HERE: (explanation) Worst sushi ever. Customer service was slow, inattentive, and just barely mediocre. Ordered sashimi and wasn't worth the price (small pieces), and thought it tasted a little funny (not fresh). I was too hungry to care that much after a long day of work. Asked for sauce multiple times before it was finally brought. And now I'm at home in the bathroom throwing up my guts. Should've gone to the viet place next door. I don't come home with food poisoning from that place. So in all, thanks for nothing and I will be in the bathroom for the next couple of hours. (sorry this is choppy, I usually never write yelp reviews as the effort isn't worth it but I made an exception for this trashy place)< /Review></record>

< review>
The sushi was a little slow to come out, but it'd not a big deal. I loved the fact that they had Toro options, and the sushi was pretty darn good
They have this sweet sake there, and I wish I found out the name of it, but it was so tasty<//review>

Terrible service, servers either didn't care or didn't know how to do their job. Sushi chef's were also to busy doing multiple shots of Sake with customers.</text>

This place is a family favorite. It's always been great and delicious.  We've tried a variety of dishes and they're all wonderful. Two things set this sushi restaurant apart from others:
1. You don't just have to rely on just soy sauce, they have delicious sauces that bring out the flavor of the rolls, without overwhelming it such as ponzu yuzu, eel sauce, spicy or sweet mayo, etc.
2. Their non-spicy sushi rolls are actually not spicy.  I've come across spicy items (wasabi or a dash of sriracha) mixed into non spicy rolls far too often at other sushi restaurants. Their regular spicy rolls are also not overwhelming.< /review>

<Review>I sat down for the sushi bar experience. Ordered Salmon Toro, Hamachi Toro nigiri. The rice did not have good consistency. It was overladen with ponzu sauce and the presentation was sloppy. If you look at the menu, this restaurant is catered towards folks who enjoy sushi rolls.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I love this place! Jimmy, YaYa, Eddie number seven and Jay are awesome sushi chefs! You walk in and its a happy ambiance, they play music you want to dance to. If youre lucky, you can catch Jimmy dancing to Lady Gaga!  The fish is awesome and fresh. Ive eaten sushi at a lot of places, this is the best in SCV!  oh and don't forget, Wannee the undercover boss lady is the glue that holds it all together! She is fun and is very attentive! This is a great place overall to eat and get together.<//Text>< pics>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>Call me an idiot, but I've been to this restaurant too many times.  Well precisely it was 3 times, but I say anybody with the right mind and a brain bigger than a chestnut should have known better.

1st time:  Sushi
Eew.  Just, eew.  My poor stomach couldn't handle the nasty raw fishes and I had to excuse myself to the restroom.  I know, TMI.  But you as a customer should know this kind of important physical reaction that you may get by risking your life here.

2nd time:  Teriyaki
Did you used to be told to chew your food really well as a kid?  Like 10 times on each side of your month?  Ya, you'd be chewing meat 20 times on each side here, making your mama proud.

3rd time:  Shrimo & Tempura combo
Shrimp was touch as a rubber, and tempura was greasy as hell.

Apparently I am insane and have a brain smaller than a chestnut...<//review><pictures>None</pictures><userid>115195624632033451651<//userid><rating>1<//rating><gmapID>0x80c27dc0bff59aed:0x8ff441e475b1027< /gmapID>< Date>

I have been eating sushi for 30+ years. The fish here is very fresh! All chefs (jimmy, yaya,eddie,jae) welcome you like family. They r talented and interactive with there own unique personality. And dont forget Wani. She is spunky/cute and the mom that holds it all together :). Hands down, the best sushi and service in santa clarita!!!! If you eat sushi and live in santa clarita, u r missing out if u dont eat here. Oh, and dont ask a chef to make u something special wink ;)< /review>

Service was extremely slow. We were sitting over 2 hours and still never got everything we ordered. When we had to ask the waitresses for water, chop sticks, and napkins (due to the table not being set) they acted as if we were a burden. Needless to say we will not be back.<//Review>

I had to scan a bunch of documents and the copy printers finally have scan and email abilities!!  Hurrah!  It used to be that you had to login to a computer and manually scan each page in.  It took forever!  I'll be back again!  The technician that helped me was very thorough and walked me through the procedure.< /Text>

First of all, they have a terrible customer service. They close before 6pm on Saturdays and if you get there before time, they will completely ignore you and refuse to serve you. Careful, about Brandy at this location, she is rude and has no courtesy at all.</Review>

I read some of the reviews and I was not going to stop here but I had no other option and I was in need of a rush project. I called around 9 am and spoke with Melissa. I explained my project and she game me some options on paper and prices. She offered to print a sample and make my decision based on the results. I walked in the store a few minutes after and she help me in person. My job was competed before 12 noon and my brochures look great!!!! Thank you Melissa for your help.< /text>

Good place to make your own copies and print documents. You can email your documents to "printandgo@fedex.com" then print them at the store with a code sent to your email. You get a card at the store and add cash to it or use your credit card. PAY ATTENTION OR YOU LOSE MONEY: the copy machines are set to COLOR Copies! You must change your choice to BLACK & WHITE! If you don't, you pay for color, which is expensive. Not sure why the default choice is color. I would give 5 stars on the copying if this was corrected.</text>

Victor was exceptionally helpful explaining the different papers and what size was appropriate for the project I had. The file I sent wasn't formatted the way I thought, so he took his time editing my images in photoshop until it was perfect. Then gave me extra copies as an insurance for my project. Victor was patient and efficient, and I will be returning to this location for all my work projects!!</Text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>*** (Hawthorne) ***
Made a quick stop to send off some goods. This Fedex is located in a super busy part of town right off of the 405 freeway Hawthorne exit.

Here's what liked...
* The location is convenient being right off of the freeway. However accessing the lot can be difficult.
* Love the customer service. The ladies at the front register were super friendly and helpful! I was caught off guard by the genuine smile and quick service :-)
* The parking lot for 8:30 am was excellent.
* There are plenty of places to eat in the plaza if you need a one-stop-shop location.

Here's what I didn't like...
* Accessing plaza was difficult with the rush hour traffic.<//Review>< pics>

Such a sigh of relief. On 6th day of work & just had to print ten pages. At the self service computer rental, & my clock is ticking trying to open my PDF. Customer service representative advised me to open in Adobe, & assisted me with making up for minutes lost. His name was Aaron. (7:37pm•08/26/2018)
He even showed me (as well as others in that area) tips & tricks to be independently proactively for next visit. His time & attention to the customer was so amazing. Like we were five years old & it was story time. Just in “Ahhh.”
Thank you Mr. Aaron. You’re appreciated!!!!!!</text>

For the attendants are impudent, ignorant and unfriendly to the Customer. The girl attendant on a photo I've asked for help for the first time she's got no clue about the paper I've requested and brought me only 4 pieces while I was needed some more. Isn't this ridiculous for a FedEX to run out of some pathetic paper? When I asked help from a guy at a counter instead, and expressed him my dissatisfaction he showed me a disrespect while I called him 'Sir' he was addressing to me as: "what's wrong man'... How does this feels? When I asked that girl on a picture why my copy has emerged that dirty she just snorted and retorted: 'why am I am computer engineer'. No! I'll rather do all the way to the Culver City Office Depot for the printing services and for some place elsewhere for the postal services from now on...

We were ignored by two employees when we entered with 6 boxes that need to be packed and shipped. I don't mind having to wait my turn, but to not acknowledge a customers existence and let me know that you will be with me momentarily is just rude me bad business! When we asked if we would be helped, an employee who was helping a customer maneuver her way around a web page (part of his job?), spoke to us in a condescending, impatient tone.  As if that weren't enough the wait was 10 minutes. If we inconvenience of re-loading our car and finding another office weren't so much we would certainly have walked out.< /review>

<review>The people in this location are useless. I would say that they need to be replace by machine but I don't think FedEx is competent enough to do that correctly. Skip this location go anywhere else.<//review>< username>

cool spot but the wifi does suck balls. i go here almost daily and the employees are very cool and helpful. a little hint, when making copies their default setting is color on their copy machines and that will hit u for close to a buck a print vs .13 cents for black and white print. regarding the WiFi, it's not starbucks, so i do not recomend camping out there to go online, go across the street to mcdonalds u cheapskates.<//Text>

The wifi used to work great a moth ago, people that go there have been complaining that the conection has been disconecting and/or timing off. When I brought it to the attention of an attendant there, a fairly young latina who wears glasses named Elizabeth, she told me that nobody had complained andthere was nothing they could do. She then refered me to rediculously expensive connection stations, I told her that I used the wifi because it was free that I did not care to pay $6.00 per hour at their Lap Net Station. It seams like FedEx Kinkos is all about the money and have forgoten what costomer service is all about.< /Text>

Fun trails, very well maintained. Everything is marked well with difficulty level. Most trails are one way which is nice so you don't have to worry as much about traffic. A bit sandy but mostly packed sand/dirt< /Review>

Pretty cool little area. Bathrooms- yep, easy to spot, definitely not the hardest area in the world to hit, but a fun few hours especially if you're cool just picking a road and rolling. Room for Jeeps, sidebysides, OHV (according to regs) and my Tacoma made easy work of it, but there's quite a few spots where a full size would catch some pretty intense pinstriping! (Avoid Squints Farm area!) Probably a pretty cool area if it catches some snow! I'll be back soon.</text>

Took a fairly stock jeep lj up there and it handled the trails fine. Be prepared to air down a bit because there are sections with small rocks throughout, nothing major though. There is a short decent right before going down to deep creek that I would recommend you have a decent lift and tires due to the size of the rocks if you want to make it down and park right next to the creek. We ran into a mixture of atvs, can-ams, dirt bikes, and offroad vehicles using the trails so be mindful, everyone was courteous though. Overall it is a great spot with a lot of trail variety.< /text>

<text>Small area to ride. Some trails that are designed for ATV and Motorcycles are 72” max and those with UTV over the width wont be able to get through and a hazard when approaching vehicles comes due to limited space and hard to open it up.  The location has limited riding area mostly moderate to beginner levels. Make sure you have Green Registeration decal and your parking pass or you will be cited. Last time I was there 8 people got cited.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Beautiful area, definitely takes time to get there, but the area was a blast to ride the dirtbikes in! There are bathrooms in the staging area, an info board with info about some of the local wildlife as well as free maps of the area.<//Text>

Better than expected, I got the 2 beef flautas and they are bigger than any place I went to for 4.99. Flavor was on point, good portions and toppings too. Tried the birria tacos with consume  for 7.99 and it was yummy and crunchy.< /review>

<text>Ordered via Grubhub and picked up our order which didn't take too long! I'm not sure if they offer dine-in right now but they do have a drive-thru and a seating area outside. We ordered the plain chips, birria, quesobirria, adobada combo plate, and a pollo asada wrap (not pictured bc my bf was too hungry and ate before I snapped a pic hahaha).

Their birrias live up to the hype! My bf really liked his wrap especially the chipotle sauce. And I love how well their adobada is seasoned. Definitely glad this place is just nearby so I can satisfy any mexican food cravings 🤤< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnoIbGdrux0nxJLIKIabio-h2C1Icjg7pi7dO3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHczcRvdQJHIhSBeeEvGIleP_AZzxcULao11G5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb2fEGGqfOQ2QSKyr8FXz41h-SQN5346B89s3i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLph7L3IEz7ihrveiQc4Clcqr98laD0Me2EtS1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuvTrN8q4v4FiOpqSYwOMoiJiiHYmsSCj1vRA3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

I've been through the drive through twice now. They're a little slow for a drive in, maybe 15 minutes with only three cars in line. The birria is really good and the San Diego Burrito is on point!</Text>

Clean, Bright spot.  Salsas are great,  orange has a good kick. Fillings were loaded. Tried the enchiladas,  a little light on sauce but good.  Tostadas,  good.  Fish taco and beef taco yumm. Potato taco, unique taste, nice and crunchy shell.  Loved the bean burrito myself.< /Review>

I wanted to see the $$ here, before eating here; as I try to get the(ir) online menu first. But that online menu not behave to connect (as there be no signal in any way).
So I call the(ir) phone#, asking to speak to who does the website, to make sure that I am speaking to a correctly intelligent person (no  sic).
Once I ask such question -- to an AGGRESSIVE voice that picked up, there was mis-communication from their end, with this language barrier. As he spoke so fast that I could not understand him.
That was a clue that he just not care to what my reason for call was; I took his answer as telling me to just come over here and look at the menu.
As I just chose to end "I THINK YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT YOU WANT ME TO EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE."

To anyone who has searched at that "menu" online page image:  see that center of the wooden panel; there be the open hole and the knot next to it.  They look like EYES staring down at you. rather dis-respectful.<//Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Read good review of this place in La Mesa Happenings.  Placed phone order. Lady on phone put me "on hold" and argued with someone in the background.  Ordered carne asada tacos and plain bean burrito (no cheese). Was told to wait 15 minutes to pick up. Got there, waited in car to give them extra time. Then waitrd in drive through lane for about 10 more minutes. Car in front never moved, so decided to park car and walk in to pick up food. Same lady from the phone said she canceled the order because we got off the line, which made no sense since we had ordered over the phone more than 30min before and took less than a minute to park the car and go inside..lady was annoyed for some reason all this time. Lady asked to repeat order, gave lady the order again and, with a pretty bad attitude, told me I had ordered a cheese burrito not a plain burrito, I told her I ordered a plain burrito (no cheese), lady said "no you didn't "... lady yhen looks at order slip and realizes she was wrong. No apology was given, but none was expected. Cook starts to prepare food..Waited for another 15 minutes. Got food, got home, inspected burrito...and guess what...yes got a cheese and bean burrito! This place needs better service. By the way the lady kept lowering her covid mask all the time. Never going back to this place.<//Review>< user>

<username>Nick Ramirez</username><rating>4</rating><review>This place is new. I will give them that grace. There are a few things to improve on as they move forward. One, timing of the orders, I don't think people want to wait 10 plus minutes for there food.  Two, accuracy of the orders. The server should not get the orders wrong or assume one dish is to one party and not to the party who actually order it. I made an order of shrimp cocktail and ceviche tostada. And the gentleman gave my order to another party so I had to wait for them to make my dish. Overall it was good. There food is good. But those are the only things to work on and they will be fine.</review>< time>

< Review>
Me and my boyfriend stumbled upon this place while driving. He was hungry and was like lets try that place. Im a taco shop connoisseur, so I was like, NO, im not gonna go to a random tacoshop. He was like all good taco shops start with a P, its good trust. ( I dont know where his logic comes from). So maybe 3 days later. He's like I want Birria tacos. So we were headed to Birria Kings, then he was like lets try that taco shop we saw. Im side eyeing him, and was like i dont remember the name. He was like google maps it. So i did and found the name. We searched the instagram and it looked BOMB. So we went on my lunch we got the surf and turf burrito and 2 birria tacos. When i say it was SOOOOO good. I was mad we didn't go the first time we saw it. We ended up going the next day just for tacos and the Nachos it was just as good. My boyfriend went a third time 2 days later and got the hot cheeto fries....he liked it. He said he is probably better if you eat it there versus traveling to take it home, cause we live like 15min away. All in all though this is our new go to Taco Shop. I can't wait to try more items on the menu. I have already bragged about this place to my friends wnd And they have the 5 Star app so you get rewards for dining there which I love. Try them you wont be disappointed!< /Review>

This is a great Mexican restaurant, with great food, great service, and a great location. Inside is very clean, well-maintained, and the staff are all friendly and welcoming. There's a fresh salsa bar that ranges from mild to aye dios mio! The restaurant is right off El Cajon Blvd with a drive thru, and easy walking access to the neighborhood around. And most importantly, the food is great!<//text>

This place is great! I've tried the shrimp quesadilla, carne asada burrito, surf n turf burrito, carne asada tacos, carne asada fries and regular shrimp burrito. All were so bomb!<//Review>

Carne asada is amazingly tasty. I come from further up in North County, but this restaurant hit the spot.

Juicy and tender carne asada isn't as common as it used to be, but these guys deliver it.

Salsa bar is small, but chilled.

Red, green, roasted, habanero and pico/chunky salsa. All good.

So spice aficionados:
Habanero is legit. Has a kick and a slow burn.

Non spice aficionados: Get the green sauce instead. More mild.<//Text>< Response>

Just found this the other day on the way home from donating plasma. It's just a few blocks from my house and I noticed they had a drive thru and I had to pick up something for my picky 15 year olds daughter, for dinner,  on the way home. So I got the usual bean and cheese burrito for her. Oddly enough she loved it. She likes about 30% of bean and cheese burritos that are purchased for her btw. Also,  I got the rolled tacos with beef and everything on them.  Delicious. We've been back a couple times since and haven't had a bad experience.  Also they are very friendly which is a major plus!

Just like to say that I've never had such faith in a Mexican restaurant serving various items ants myself,  partaking in them! Usually I stick to the same old thing  because I'm afraid to try something new especially when I'm hungry, and that's a big risk! I have gone here several times now and I order something different every single time.  They haven't failed me on taste...Chile relleno, cheese enchilada, chips and guac (simple yet...YUM), fish taco, shrimp burrito, Rolled tacos.. i've had all of them so gar but can't wait to add to the list!</Review>

< Review>
In this corner, weighting in as the "cleanest" shop on El cajon blvd, I give you the Challenger Penelopes Mexican food.  I the vegetarian found the menu a little typical at first.  The veggie burrito is a bean and cheese with the average topping but damn it was it tasty.  They are so new I saw the health inspector on my way out.  Large lot right across the street from the go lounge and from what I've seen better food than chelatos and open more as well.  I wanna see what there menu looks like after the horde of la Mesa taste buds require.  Customer service on point. My burrito was so fast that by the time I hit up the salsa bar and filled my first cup I got it and bit into it. This yellow sauce what I think is the hottest, nose running, lips aching,  habenero sauce from parks all the way down to college.  I hope the expand the vegetarian menu, I hope they make the hot sauce just a little thicker, I love the idea that I'll never visit the place in front of the blvd.</Review>

I went to buy a burrito.
I promise you when I say this, my burrito
Was 65% onions, 15% cilantro and then meat.

I'll never ever eat there again.< /review>

<Text>Just had Penelope's for the second time in a month. Really good Mexican without trying be over the top. The Carnitas tacos add a generous scoop of guacamole to the crispy pork. The Chori Pollo tacos are an amazing mix of chorizo and chicken with onions and cilantro tossed in. Top it with their habanero hot sauce and you have spicy perfection.
The rolled tacos, topped with real guacamole and cotija, are solid, too.<//Text><Date>1596324263836</Date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great taco shop with a drive through. Everything is great here. Try the birria tacos. The chile relleno burrito is good too. And the fish tacos. And the potatoe tacos. Did I mention everything is great.

The only thing I've had that I didn't like was the diablo burrito because it was too spicy (and I generally like spicy food). Like imagine if the devil wanted to make a burrito to torture you. That's how hot it was.< /Text>< Pictures>

I got rolled tacos, very meaty, cooked just right. Also a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream. Great flavor to the beans, generous with the sour cream. They also offer 3 flavors of hot sauce. Red, green and a habanero .  Both reds deliciously hot. I'll go back< /text>

<text>As someone that grew up in tijuana and still lives in, I gotta give up to this restaurant. My standards on tacos are very high and that's very hard to find in SD. This is place is legit tijuanita. I had their quesabirrias and omg! The size, the cheese, the condiments! Well seasoned, salsa waa amazing as well.
But what made me do this my new mexican spot is how extremely CLEAN is this restaurant. I dont eat at just any kind restaurant because of that, you can see how clean the kitchen is, the bathroom were sparkling clean. HIGHLY recommend this place and they have drive through too. Can't wait to come back and have some more amazing birria.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>The first time I walked in to this restaurant, I was greeted with a smile and treated great. It's a very welcoming environment and the food is amazing. I grew up on Mexican food and this reminds me of why Mexican food is my favorite. The Carne Asada is always cooked perfect and is very tasty. I've tried a majority of the items on the menu and they've  all met and exceeded my expectations. It's also a great value based on the cost to what you get. I love this place and would highly recommend it to everyone.<//review>< Pictures>

Order carne asada fries and a shrimp el diablo, burrito.  The carne fries were average in every way. The burrito was insanely dry and had hardly any shrimp in. I tried the place after reading the positive reviews. Maybe they tried harder when they first opened. I don't think I'd eat here again.</Review>

<Text>Food is very good. Fish taco breading too thick. Potato taco great, as well as the bean tostada.  The carne asada plate was great and enough for two!</Text><username>Dorothy Duprey</username></record>

<Text>Food was substandard. Fajitas are supposed to be strips of beef or chicken grilled over an open fire and seasoned served with seared bell peppers. What I got was diced up carne asada burrito meat, decidedly not cooked over an open fire. mixed with nearly raw bell pepper chunks. I also ordered a side of guacamole. What I got was barely guacamole. It was virtually runny and tasteless. Very unimaginative. Taco Bell has better guacamole. The refried beans and rice we're okay, but then again it's really hard screw up refried beans or rice.
I would suggest you go someplace else and spend a few dollars more for Mexican food the tastes better than this<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>The place is so lonely and empty, that it is imposible to think that they have anything fresh I had fish tacos plate and fish was dry and over fried almost burned, you can notice that the cabbage was oxidizing already brownish, same with shrimp taco....and it is a mexican place nothing new more of the same< /Text>< Pictures>

I've visited Penelope's 4 times since they opened. I've ordered the carne asada fries, enchiladas suizas, fish taco and the beef tacos combo. Consistently delicious food that's not outrageously priced.< /text>

I went there expecting to have a better help given that the other place in Castro had a long waiting time and that one was basically empty. That did not help, I was not even treated, they just sent me home and told me to have ibuprofen. I ended up going to the ER the next morning for something that was actually treatable. Also, the billing department is very bad. Make sure you double check with your insurance if this one is in network, since the answer for this question in the "Questions" section of Google Reviews is not updated.< /text>< pictures>

Shannon was by far the best health provider I've been to in years. She worked quickly but with such accuracy. She let me talk and explain my situation and I personally can't thank her and all the wonderful Women working that evening i dropped in. I wish I lived closer so i could continue to see her!< /review>

<Text>Staff were polite and professional. I’ve gone to other urgent care facilities in the past and always received a startling medical fee, although this facility charged me far less than I anticipated. Even as a walk-in, the wait time was only 15 minutes and I was out in 40. I’d highly recommend coming here even if it’s a bit more out of the way than other facilities.<//Text>< user>

Very pleasant and positive experience at this clinic. Efficient system and friendly staff. Dr. Spencer was just awesome. Ankle brace he recommended has been perfect. Hopefully I don't have to come back here anytime soon but if I ever needed to go to urgent care, this is the place!! Recommending to everyone I know.</review>

<Review>They took me on a Saturday which was great. However I had a UTI which made me have to go to the bathroom and they would not let me in before my appointment to go due to Covid. So that was painful and discouraging. Also they do not have the equipment to do ultrasounds or instant urine tests. Had to go to the ER the following day.</Review>< Pics>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>I am very disappointed with the check in process at this urgent care location. I think if you have insurance, and don’t have any questions, including how to check in, then you would enjoy this place. The clerk, Jin, is horrible, I have never experienced a receptionist who is so rude before, who cuts you off and who makes you feel horrible for asking questions and for not having insurance. Shame on you, and shame on you Dignity Health!

I’m a nurse who’s company has messed up on my insurance. So technically I will have insurance, I don’t have any membership number now. I called the insurance and they sent me here, and asked me to ask for an insurance waiver putting her name down and the date “MaryLJan11,2021.”

I walked in and initially she’ll smile and welcome you, asked for you to check in online via the link she sent you via text. When you ask her a question on the process, she gets visibly annoyed and say “I don’t know, it’s all online, I don’t know about that.” My tip is to not ask her any questions, don’t give her any more work than she’s probably used to, because it’s not worth her getting upset.

When she asked about insurance, I told her that I I’m in between insurance and I called my insurance and Mary has asked me to—, can’t even finish, she cuts you off, very annoyed now, and rudely stated that she doesn’t deal with insurance, she doesn’t know who Mary is!

I’m very sorry to have made her life so miserable. I swear I don’t expect her to know who Mary is. I just wanted to tell her that insurance asked me to ask her for a form. That’s it! One form. Moral of the story, don’t ask her questions or for anything. If you need an itemized receipt, ask the supervisor. Don’t ask for an insurance waiver form, just pay out of pocket.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>It was easy to make an appointment and fast to check in, however the doctor provided less than optimal advice about how to treat my the cut on my face.  He said to let it dry and scab over.  I have since learned that this leads to a worse scar and that the wound should not be allowed to scab over but kept moist with vaseline or aquaphor after cleaning.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1615506462965, 'text': 'We would like to learn more about your review, Kimberly.

I saw a PA for really bad shoulder pain. She did not take an x ray or anything else. She did lecture me on the fact that urgent care is for urgent needs. I was in so much pain. She did offer me prescription strength aleve. I will not go there again. The medical assistant that took my vitals was very kind of you have a real issue please go see your primary cara doctor.<//Text>

The employees that worked when I went into the Lombard Office were kind, organized, understanding, and so helpful with all of my needs, questions, and concerns! Additionally, the COVID testing at Piedmont in Oakland on was prompt, efficient, and professional. The testers were also very straightforward while being understanding. They sought to provide a stress free but smart testing experience! I can’t thank all of Dignity Health for what they are doing amongst these crazy times. So grateful!</Review>

I’ve been to their Market St. location but this was by first visit to their Lombard St. facility. I was seen promptly. All staff were friendly and professional. I was comfortable with COVID precautions. I was surprised to find they have an x-ray machine on site. I returned for another issue several months later and I’m still very i pressed. Excellent service from all staff. Very thorough, explained everything, and addressed all my concerns. I was very pleased with all COVID precautions. I was seen promptly and did not share space with other patients.</text>

<Review>Shady, at best

Went to get a tb test. Payed $20 up front for a bill that costs $25. Then a few weeks down the line I get a bill with a "office new patient detailed" charge that is $391!!! I'm not paying that and will never go back uere< /Review>< Pictures>

USELESS
Doctors are terrible and not very helpful, very long wait times even when I was the only patient in the building. Save your time and go to your primary care provider or ER instead. Most of the time they will send you home with ibuprofen.< /review>

Been here three times. They once told me my knee was not broken and it’d be better in 3 days, had to go to a different urgent care to discover it truly was broken. All three times were filled with things like that with wrong diagnoses with my leg or with a stomach bacteria infection. They’re absolutely terrible.< /Text>

The staff was really really friendly, from the moment I stepped in there. The front desk guy was so nice and tried to relate with me and make me feel better because I was crying and slightly panicking. I had a like 30 min wait which sucked because I was bleeding pretty badly and I wish it was way cheaper, but oh well I guess. But the care I received by everyone was really wonderful. Cheerful, weren’t robots, super down to earth real people, felt like they truly cared about me and making sure I was all taken care of. 10000% recommend this place. I will definitely be going back here if I need urgent care.< /review>

Avoid this place. Incompetence bordering on negligence. Came in for an appointment after coming down with terrible and very obvious cold/flu symptoms. I waited 1.5 hours only
To be told by the NP (Matthew Brooks) to just “wait it out” and take over the counter Tylenol. I have an autoimmune disorder and take immunosuppressant medications, and they wouldn’t even test me for the flu or strep despite me specifically requesting that they do so as a precautionary measure as my Rheumatologists have strictly advised. I’m fully covered by insurance and it would’ve taken 5 mins of their time to do so. To make matters worse, Matthew was insulting and completely condescending about my disease and even compared it to his own being worse in an unprofessional manner.

After being dismissed and told by this place that I was fine, I immediately left and went to UCSF, where they confirmed I had a 100.3 fever AND positive for the flu! Golden Gate’s equipment didn’t even properly register my temperature... which they made me take on my own! This practice and Matthew Brooks are putting others at risk of contracting illnesses by their lack of care and poor service. Will not be coming back and advise anyone else to avoid as well.< /Text>

After being let in 45 minutes after my appointment they tried drawing blood five times over the course of an hour. After they couldn’t do it, I was given some lab sheets and told to go somewhere else where they presumably had a staff capable of drawing my blood.

In sum, this location was incapable of providing the required medical care, stabbed me 5 times until I was about to faint, and wasted the better part of my afternoon.

Stear clear.

(Note: Their tardiness and extremely rude front receptionist probably merit a separate review.)</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Fast, courteous, professional.

I came into Golden Gate on Lombard mid-afternoon with a 2.5" long gash on my shin. I knew I would need stitches. The two receptionists greeted me promptly and courteously, and I signed in as a walk-in. Immediately, a screen displayed my approximate wait time. On this particular afternoon, I only had to wait 5-10 minutes before being called back to a room. The nurses on staff were kind, caring, and professional; and the nurse practitioner who stitched me up was really wonderful (Brandon, or Brendan). He was upbeat and communicative, and let me know what was happening every step of the way. He was careful in administering enough numbing medication so I wouldn't feel a thing, and he did a great job putting in 9 stitches and offering me all of the information I needed for follow-up care. Part of my good experience had to do with how quickly I was seen. This is, of course, highly variable, but the staff will post your wait time and take good care of you once it's your turn.< /Text>

<review>I had a great experience here. It was a fairly slow morning that I went in as a walk-in. Waited maybe 15 minutes in the waiting room and about 10-15 for the doctor. Tests were quick and the doctor was thorough and helpful about medicines. Even offered for me to come back if I needed anything in the next few days. Even the girls at the front desk were super nice. Would definitely recommend this clinic.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808580d6ab770fc1:0xfa623023b0da466e< /GmapID></record>

<Review>Here is the summary of my interaction with Golden Gate Urgent Care:

I traveled to San Francisco on Friday Nov 30th for a conference and I got digestive issue the day after. The problem got much worse on Sunday Dec 2nd with diarrhea and bad breath at the same time suggesting an infection.
I went to Golden Gate Urgent Care early Monday morning. The health provider visited me after an hour of wait in a room. She asked a few basic questions and told me they need to collect stool samples. She didn't tell me what the issue could be.
I provided the samples on site and I was told that I will be contacted when the results when they are ready. I haven't received any phone call as of today!! I tried to call them every evening to get an update. The first two days, the receptionist offensively told me that I have to wait and there is nothing they can do. Wednesday evening, however, the same receptionist get into a fight with me once I told her that I am leaving San Francisco soon and I need an answer. She then hang up the phone on me. They are not answering my phone calls after that!

That was the worst urgent care experience I have had. The words "urgent care" in the title of the place suggest the visitors are looking for some urgent response. The way they treated me is mind blowing. I could have been dead because of an internal infection while I was waiting for a call which never happened.

I am very upset and unsatisfied about the situation and  I am following up with my insurance company on the situation.  I won't recommend this place to anyone!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808580d6ab770fc1:0xfa623023b0da466e< /gmapID></record>

The staff at this place is completely incompetent. The front desk was not staffed, so they had patients wait for over an hour and a half without providing any guidance whatsoever on when they would start accepting patients. An hour and a half in they had accepted one patient with another 8 on queue in the lobby, still without any guidance on what to expect.

While i understand and appreciate that places may be understaffed, it is the duty of the medical care office to be honest and let the waiting patience know, or simple close their doors for the morning so people go elsewhere. This is an urgent care medical office, after all. Instead the incompetent staff at this place had 8 unwell people wait around providing misleading guidance for over an hour an a half. If what you’re looking for is a timely appointment with competent staff, this is not the place for you. If what you’re looking for is a waiting room to share germs with other unwell people while you aimless wait, this may be the urgent care for you.</text>

This place is the exact epitome of one of the many reasons the healthcare system is broken. You're much better off going literally anywhere else. Despite still being open, they turned me away when I was actually in need of 'urgent' care. The two ladies at the front desk were unprofessional, rude, and lacked any empathy at all. They told me that they didn't think that the staff would have enough time to treat me before closing, and therefore could not help me. Despite the fact that they clearly have zero medical training to make an assessment like this (and from the looks of it, no professional training of any sort) they still decided this for the doctors. It took quite a bit of arguing over this for them to even consider asking an actual trained professional if they would consider helping me. At this point I obviously declined, for concerns that I wouldn't be helped in a professional way, given that the people in this office only care about leaving at the exact second their shift ends, and not a single bit about the people in need of help who walk through the door. The worst part is, there are no checks and balances or repercussions for such terrible service from a medical provider. No accountability in our healthcare system to prevent terrible offices like this from treating, or REFUSING TO TREAT patients. Avoid at all costs.<//review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I can't say how grateful San Francisco should be to have these amazing people and awesome place as a resource to our community. No more ER waits, nor making an appointment with your doctor in 2 weeks for a problem today. I've been here 3 times: 1. severed finger, 2. sinus infection, 3. severe abdominal pain. Each time they have been helpful, professional and speedy. The facilities are clean. The staff is very nice. And my insurance covers it to boot! You can make an appointment online, or walk-in and wait (which has never been more than 30-45mins). If you have a condition where you can't wait to see your doctor and this is not a major life-threatening case, this is THE PLACE to come to for quick, professional medical attention.

Generally runs on time.  Smooth, efficient process.  Friendly, informed staff and medical personnel.  No fight to dispense actual medication, as there is with some organizations.  Whenever my primary care physician is unavailable or has a full schedule, Golden Gate Urgent Care is my go-to spot!  Thank you, G.G.U.C., for your consistent and reliable service!</review>

I had sustained a large gash on my index finger and needed a quick stitch. My personal care physician was booked for the day but I was quickly referred to this place. All the reviews on Yelp and Google were glowing so I decided to commit.

Phenomenal experience at GG Urgent Care. Not only is the space roomy, modern and clean but the staff is incredibly friendly and personal. I was in-&-out within 30 minutes with a bill that would have easily been 10-15x more at the ER.

Enjoyed my stay and will definitely come back when needed!</Review>

I got really good care in August 2015 after a bike accident. Really nice people.

But...
They asked me to pay a deposit of $150. My insurance told me more than 2 months ago I should have paid less than $100, but I never heard back from Golden Gate Urgent Care.

I couldn't find any email address on their website, and as I'm traveling outside of the USA, I have no way to call them.</text>

Making an appointment online was a zip (even though appointments aren't necessarily). The facility is very clean, professional, and the friendly care givers give you the utmost respect and attention. We went here on a Monday morning, and it wasn't busy, so the wait time after the simple check-in was only a few minutes. The doctor on staff was very friendly, asked many questions, and provided us with all the information we needed. As an example to the attention of details given, the nurse even provided an array of different granola bars to consume that patients don't have to take the medicine on an empty stomach. On checkout, we were provided with print out instructions and a bag to put out medicine in. There is a reason why this place has so many good reviews.</review>

<Text>I am an Internist in SF.  I have referred more than 10 patients to Golden Gate Urgent .  My Patients have reported back to me the outstanding care that they have received.  I refer patients with non life threatening wounds or symptoms.  One patient, appropriately, required hospital intervention, and was taken to the right hospital.  All of my patients have noted the professionalism of the staff, the short wait time, the wonderful care that they have received, without the long ER waits or fees.  I am so grateful that Golden Gate Urgent Care is available; they are Not a "Doc in the Box".

I had symptoms of sore throat and fever. They performed a throat culture for strep and told me they would call if the culture was positive so that I could start an antibiotic.  My fever worsened, I became sicker and missed work.

TWENTY TWO DAYS later, they informed me that the culture was positive.  They refused to explain the delay and instructed me to email their COO to get answers to 1) why I wasn't informed of the positive result of a bacterial infection or 2) provide instruction for the best course of treatment moving forward. He never responded to my email.<//Text>

This place is very clean and professional-looking, but beware.

I was sent to this place by mistake by my primary doctor. I didn't/don't have insurance that will cover Golden Gate Urgent care. I realized this at the check-in desk at the time for my appointment. Due to my being sick for 6 weeks, I considered paying the $253 out-of-pocket for a visit.

I was assured by the nurse practitioner (Brian, I think) that I could have my prescription from him filled at a Kaiser (my insurance) pharmacy so that it wouldn't cost an obscene amount of money. It was under this impression that I agreed to pay the $253 appointment fee up front.

It turns out that all the Kaiser pharmacies refused to fill his prescription, so I would need to pay again out of pocket at a walgreens (another 200-300$) to have my prescription from him filled. I can't afford another exorbitant fee.

Ultimately having walked out without a diagnosis or a prescription that I could afford, I politely emailed the office manager Alex Lee and asked if a refund could be given, or failing that, what else could be done. I was ignored first for 8 days before getting a response (after my 3rd email) saying "I am not quite sure what you are looking for or how you would like this resolved." I politely emailed back the same day, got no response, and emailed again 12 days later. I still have not received a response.

The whole experience has left me feeling like they are very unprofessional by ignoring me, and also in refusing to be held accountable.<//text>

<text>We were visiting SF and were doing a trail running race.  Unfortunately, one of the runners in our group took a digger and cut open her hand.   My wife and I are both physicians and were nervous since we didn't know the medical community in SF.   We ended up at Golden Gate and couldn't have been happier.   Clean modern facility, quick efficient check in and most importantly outstanding medical care.    If we could give it 6 stars we would.  If you have something going on that doesn't require an ER, get to Golden Gate Urgent Care.<//text>< Name>

I grew up playing sports and tended to be accident prone so I've seen it all when it comes to bedside manner. On Tuesday I took a pretty big fall while at work and injured my ankle severely. I am not from San Francisco so when I fell I was unsure of where to go. My HR manager suggested this place, immediately upon arriving I was greeting by a caring and smiling face as I hobbled my way out of my Uber. I wish I could remember everyone's name so they could receive the credit they deserve. The receptionist helped me get in a wheel chair, and made sure I was seen as quickly as possible. She went above and beyond to help me figure out the whole workers comp situation. As promised I was quickly taken back to the room and they began checking out my ankle. Each person I interacted with treated me with exceptional care which unfortunately tends to be a rare occurrence, especially in the urgent care sector of the medical field. While I wish I never had to go to Golden Gate Urgent Care in the first place, I'm glad that I ended up there. Thank you to those of you who helped get me taken care of and for treating me like a person. You helped calm my fears and soothe my worries and for that I'm truly grateful.</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><userid>114352240088644436992< /userid>< resp>

<text>Excellent!!!  My daughter was traveling, and pricked her finger.  At first she didn't think any think of it.  But it became infected and had achy symptoms in her arm.   Being out of town, and with a new insurance we needed help.

I called Golden Gate Urgent Care, spoke to Audrey and she listened carefully, made a recommendation and scheduled my daughter an appointment within the hour.

Truly an Urgent Care that CARES.  Thank you to all that helped us.< /text><GmapID>0x808580d6ab770fc1:0xfa623023b0da466e<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The person I talked to was pretty defensive and told me it would cost me at least $250. That's pretty ridiculous. I think it says a lot about a healthcare provider when they clearly value money over the health of their patients. I told them I'd even pay like $50, just to come in for a checkup that would take 5 minutes and that wasn't even considered. Doesn't inspire much confidence for their service.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1513951880386, 'text': 'Dear Mr. Kellar:  We are happy to see patients for renewal of their prescriptions and often can lower the price of the visit for a simple refill.

<review>So this was the first time I had to use urgent care of any sort. My experience was really good. They took my information and my insurance. I had to pay $50 check-in fee. And my prescription was like $30. So the insurance I used was California blue cross blue shield PPO. So they do accept insurances but the cost of getting an open wound sitched up is 1/4 the cost of a hospital visit compared  an urgent care facility. Great doctors and staff, and it looks really clean.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
I came to my appointment on time and very sick. I waited for an hour on the bench for someone to see me. I was diagnosed with strep throat. They did a bunch of unnecessary tests unrelated to strep when that was the obvious issue. They charged me over $700 and my in network top ranked insurance only covers half of that. I paid $360 out of pocket. To top it all off they prescribed me  old school penicillin and I had a sever allergic reaction.</Review>

I have always had the best experiences. GGUC is very quick in getting you in even without an appointment. The office is also very clean and brand new which is nice. I use GGUC for almost everything. The facility is a great 'go-to' for your general medical needs. I would only go outside of GGUC if I needed to see a specialist. I had a recent experience with a PA named Adam Shiffman and he was so informative and helpful with what I was dealing with medically. I encourage you to check out GGUC as it makes seeking medical attention easy, informative and convenient.<//Review><Date>1411149758665<//Date>< username>

45 mins into my appointment and I haven’t been called in yet. There’s no point in making appointments here, it’s merely to put you in line. Plan to spent 2-3 hrs at a minimum with an appointment. Find another Urgent Care.<//Review>

I can assure you that patient care is top priority and it must have been a very busy time in the clinic! With a variety of injuries and illnesses, as we are an urgent care, we can see a range of cases that can sometimes take longer to treat. Again, we are sorry to hear about your experience."}<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>I was seen by Dr. Zager he told me I should go to a free clinic and he didn't want to treat me. It was a horrible experience and in end I got his message I will never go back there. If you want to pay to be belittled and demeaned then this is the place for you.<//Review><user_name>Rose A<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
The worst clinic stay away .. Me and my baby  we when there and we ask if the take our insurance and the later when they see us they said they don't take our insurance they charge even more 50 + like 220 for visit so they can just put bandage on him what I can do my self  more because we didn't have emergency witch they don't tell you an till your inside  with a doctor and not just that they don't treat us well and they didn't even give my baby pain killer and on top of everything the call social serve on us because they are so unprofessional that they though a burn that he had was something different that's how professional they are are</Review>

They were truly excellent! They are busy, so be prepared to wait between 45 minutes and an hour. It's worth the wait. I will continue to go back.</Review>

<review>Fast Service! Amazing job! I always get a hand wash and get offered wax. When I say yes, my car ends up with white shadow marks. Before saying yes to Raffi. I said NO! I'm always disappointed with wax, but let me tell you this place won't leave you disappointed. It's a great car wash that's actually open late unlike most. People need their wash on Fridays and we all work and get stuck in traffic. Reason why I went on yelp and found USA Car Wash. Thanks guys! Will be coming back.</review><rate>4</rate>< resp>

They didn't even clean my car they just wiped it down, we where complaing about this place with other customers about them not doing the job correctly. We took off and when we looked at the back seats they didn't even wipe it there was still crumbs and dirt and also on the dash was rocks and dirt from the rag. This place was awesome with the old workers and owner but now the young kids don't even do the job and the manager thinks its a joke, I am never I repeat never coming back here again.< /review>

< Review>
I love trying out different branches for Noodles and co, this branch did not disappoint, we arrived around lunch time, the restaurant was nearly empty with only 2 tables occupied, when trying to decide with what to go with, the cashier lady was extremely friendly and helpful in suggesting a few, we ended up with spaghetti Alfredo ( omit the chicken), Mac & cheese for the kids, spicy green shrimp Thai curry(the new bowl that has been recently added to the menu) and garlic bread as a side dish, i really liked the taste of the Alfredo, not too much cheese and sauce that would be too empowering, my hubby on the other hand didn't like the new bowl, the combination between the pineapple, shrimps and sauce just didn't blend well, I'm afraid he would not be coming back to try Noodles and co as a result ,  as for me well lets just say ill have to come solo  from now on<//Review>

A wonderful little noodle shop, in the Fountains of Roseville. Highly worth a visit to the place, to get your fix of noodles.

The noodles were flavorful, and there was enough of them in the Large, however a normal size, is definitely a smaller portion than usual.

Highly worth a visit, and would recommend to anyone wanting noodles.<//text>

It was good service and the food was pretty good.  It was a bit messy with the lunch rush and ride customers leaving their masses behind.< /text>

Got a small Mac and cheese with an add on of the breaded chicken breast, I was given the grilled. Also got the dumplings which were average. Seemed like a typical fast food joint (for pasta.) Probably wouldn't visit again. If I want pasta, I'd personally want real Italian.</review>< pictures>

Love the fact that you can order online and skip the line, just walk in and go right to the front. Kids love all the noodle dishes and can’t beat the newer digital drink machine that lets you make tons of flavored options.< /review>

Had Noodles & Co to go last night, it was fantastic.  I had the Alfredo MontAmore which is a chicken Alfredo dish spiced perfectly.  My mouth is watering thinking about it!  My family enjoyed their meals as well.  Noodles & Co is also a great support to the community helping non profits with fund raising.  Good food and good neighbors.< /Text>

The food was pretty good. The staff was very nice and helpful. I was expecting some noodles with broth Asian style. There wasn't any broth though. Its kinda like a Panera except with noodles instead of bread.</text>

And you combine that with aggressive, rude or just clueless California drivers, you have a recipe for road rage, accidents & mayhem.

I am addicted to this place! Whenever I end up in there, I end up needing about $20,000 of merchandise every time. Sadly, I only live with a few items. But it keeps me going back halfway all the time!

Super friendly staff is well by the way. The place is also extremely clean and orderly. Well done to the management and employees of this place so far.< /Text>

A maze of stores to choose from. Just off the 78 freeway near the 5 freeway, Pacific Coast Plaza has mostly big-box retailers like Best Buy, Dick's sporting goods, Walmart, Bed Bath and Beyond, among others. There's only one entrance and exit, which can be frustrating if the store you're going to is at the very end of the plaza. I usually come here to shop at the Best Buy, since they have a larger camera selection than normal stores.<//text>

7E2B23: Quite a few popular stores in the shopping square including Walmart, Best Buy etc. Usually fairly busy with lot of cars going in and out of parking lot. Parking lot adequate to handle the traffic with adequate size parking stalls. The parking lot lights were out in the section where parked out car close to Best Buy.< /Text>

Pacific coast plaza is a good place to take care of a lot of your errands in one stop, well maybe a couple of stops because it's rather large. There is a large variety of retailers in this shopping center all the way from Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Satsples, Party City, Stater Brothers, the list goes on.. And if you want you can even get your nails done if you want. easy access and centrally located near interstate 5 and highway 78 in Oceanside off Jefferson Street.< /Text>

Couldn't find a soul to let me know where the snow pants were, finally found someone coming back from lunch who pointed to the mens winter apparel was. Very limited selection but a undisclosed sale scored me the pants for 40 :)<//Text>

Oh my God
This is like the best plaza, pacific coast plaza. Hit it up! Skate the parking lot! Loiter! It's just a nice place to have shops and maybe do a kick flip. We do Krumpin in the parking lot on Sundays. Five dollars. Kids eat free. A plus pacific coast plaza. You need to be here! What you doing< /review>

There is the freedom to walk around unbothered, however, its nice to have an employee if you have a question and today she was a very nice lady in the self check area...</review>

There are really good shops here, places where I frequently buy things.  Walmart, Best Buy, many restaraunts, phone store, office supplies, gasoline, car wash, etc.  The place is always busy, which is a good indicator that people like it.  Many specialty shops.  Good parking.<//Review>

Plenty of parking. There's a Walmart and the Bed Bath & Beyond. Across the street there are food options such as Mimi's Cafe sandwich shops. I work in this Plaza and I like that I can just head over to the Walmart and pick up items for my family.<//review>

Places clean seems well-organized you don't see some buildings that need work and others that look like they were from a couple centuries ago people are generally friendly and there's a lot of shops to choose from and a variety of different things.</Review>
