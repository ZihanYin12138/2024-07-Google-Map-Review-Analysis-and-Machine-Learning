The food is good but I ordered online for pickup ASAP and they didn’t even start the order until I arrived and called, and even then it took over 25 additional minutes of waiting. They really have to improve their operations.< /text>

<text>Good Concept, Decent Food
We had lunch at the La Canada branch of this fresh Mediterranean fast casual concept. Although somewhat Americanized, the ingredients were fresh and the food was fine. After ordering at the counter, the food is brought to your table as it is made (not necessarily all at once). The main difference between this place and more traditional places serving similar food is that Luna Grill is more expensive and has less bold flavors. The casual vibe was good for the kids and the staff was friendly and helpful.</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

12/07/2018 We came here for lunch with our company and while ordering the cashier charged us more than what it was on the menu. I asked her why the prices are not the same. she told me, that they just raised the prices. This is a rip-off and they didn't even told/notic us that the prices have been changed. But the food is great.<//text>

I've been here several times. The food is always fresh and the service is great. My favorite is the flat cut chicken kabob with basmati rice. I get hummus and pita bread as my sides. You can buy an add'l 6 pieces of pita for $1 - totally worth it. They also have fresh brewed iced tea. I highly recommend this restaurant.<//review>

The place is very new. There's a Baked Bear build your own cookie ice cream sandwich franchise next door.

The workers were friendly. The cashier was helpful and another worker helped get me a free chipotle cream sauce on the side.

The chicken was tasty and not dry, but I wish there was a little more chicken in the $10 salad. The food was good but it's tough bc there's so much good Persian Armenian food in Glendale, La Crescenta, Atwater, Burbank, and other nearby areas.</Text>< GmapID>

I gave this place a second try,the food is just average. To many better Mediterranean restaurants in my opinion. If in the area I would go again. On the other hand the service is on spot! Adrian is a great customer service employee.<//Text>

I thought the inside of the restaurant was well-designed, clean, and modern. We ordered kabobs mainly and the meat was juicy and the rice definitely fluffy, and definitely the yogurt sauce was a highlight. as long as your expectations are reasonable for casual dining, this place is solid and won't disappoint.</review>

Although I have only eaten here once I thought the food was very good. I had the ground beef kabob and it was excellent. Hummus was just as good as the one I make at home. The yogurt dip was just as good. I would definitely recommend it to others.  Btw, the inside decor is interesting and so was the bathrooms. I gave it 4 stars because 5 would have to be exceptional.<//Review>

<text>I haven’t even tasted the food yet (will update when I do), but I’m already unimpressed by the sloooww service. One person in front of us in line, and it was at least 10 minutes to get through. Now we are watching as they sloooowly deliver food to people sitting around the dining areas. Boyfriend’s plate just came. Waiting for mine. Yes, that’s how they delivered to other tables too...

Ok, so the food was pretty good, but I don’t think I would come here again (hungry—as usually am when I go out for food) and wait to get it.

We were just trying to grab a bite before heading up into the mountains.  Turned into quite a stopover.

1 star for service & operation; 3 stars for food.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Name>

Food is good but most disorganized place i have ever seen. Almost every order out of 7 orders was made wrong and some of them twice. Part of the order was also missing completely. Maybe it was our bad luck, but we wated so much time going back and forth that it was too frustrating to ignore.< /review>

I went with a coworker for lunch. The food was fresh and delicious, and the place was cozy. There is an outdoor patio, and they even decorated for Halloween! My salad was of medium size, which was perfect, and you can ask for dressing on the side. Service was great as everyone was friendly.< /Review>

I’ve eaten here a few times and usually the food is good.  Tonite I tried the beef gyro in pita bread.  Just Awful!  The meat was tasteless, dry and barely warm.  The dill sauce was mediocre and no hummus or tahini provided!   I think I’ll go elsewhere.<//Review>

Very small location, food has almost no sauce inside, wrappings poor in meat and the place is pricey, you get only ONE napkin!
The food was awful. Not recommended at all!< /Text>

Autmosphere is nice they have a beautiful seating outside which I like it the most.
Food is good not great cause Mediterranean food is our specialty so I know which one is good which one is great but I still recommend this place as a Mediterranean nice restaurant.

<Text>Was OK. Would prefer that they didn't skimp on the falafel and also not cut them in half. I feel as though they cut the falafel in half so it seems as if you're getting more. They could also add more vegan options to the menu. Reminded me of a say Panera bread Mediterranean style. I got the falafel wrap which was wraped in lettuce because there was no vegan wrap option. Comes with french fries and tahini sauce which was good but such a small sized sauce I had to ask for another. Large amount of fries that the bf helped me eat. He got the beat bowl which again the falafel was skimped on.</Text>< Name>

< review>
Chicken is very tasty.  I ordered a seasonal beet salad and added chicken. This is an order at the counter before being seated casual place.  Indo find their combinations a bit odd.  My salad had roasted tomatoes but fairly pedestrian  beets that could have come out of a can, which I love but I guess was expecting something a bit more elevated.  They serve hummus which I am not a big  fan of and do not serve baba ganoush/mouttabal (which I love!).   I tasted my lunch partner's.  It had a strange sweetness and was not that thick.  I realise there are many different cultures represented in Middle-Eastern cooking. Having never eaten at a Halal establishment and my expectations being based on my 50 or so years of  eating Israeli, Persian, Lebanese, and Armenian food probably coloured my perception but all-in-all food was fresh and tasty.  This is a good casual dining option in LA Canada.</review>

Tipo um Habib's gourmet que serve comida saudável, mas infinitamente melhor que um Habib's. Mas não lembra o Habib's por que tem esfiha e sim porque é uma franquia de comida do oriente médio, com vários endereços na Califórnia e alguns no Texa.

Tudo é bem gostoso, não é nada de outro mundo, mas é uma boa opção rápida e acessível, com vários pratos comuns à nós brasileiros, como charutos, falafel, hummus, tabules, saladas bem generosas e os pratos combinados, também muito bem servidos, sem miséria.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Owned by the City, and they are painfully slow to get anything done, and don't do it well when they do. Always amazed at the incompetence.< /Review>

Intinmate public club open to all. Friendly and unpretentious. Reasonably priced. Small town feel. Lots of activity, fun clinics and coaching, quality play at varying levels.  Nice facilities even if the architecture is dated, but that gives it a unique charm.

Gotta love this hidden so cal jewel!< /Review>

Okay I get its place a 4-star I'll explain to you why first and foremost there's a lot of Old-Timers and I mean by that it's probably 70 plus that go there age-wise the sports shop is a good spot to go buy things if you need something real quick little expensive and they only carry Babolat nothing else but Babolat material it wasn't my cup of tea it was a little far of a drive but it was well worth it because I made up for it after when something to eat with my family< /review>

I like their frequently changing selection of decor items.  Some items are priced a little high, but their sales and clearance are good.  The store is always clean and well set up, although the isles are small and difficult to get through if there are many customers.  Staff are all friendly and helpful.< /Review>

They jump you at the door so thats irritating but i always let them know i want to look and will let them know if i find anything. That usually works.

<Review>Let's all be safe,  I've been wanting Golden China for a while but have been staying home. Doing my part with the virus I went and got some food.  Safety was first but we also talked  6 feet apart  Reminiscing and seeing how each other's family was doing during this time. Prays up to everyone< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>I asked the salesperson at the hardware store on Ocean Ave what was the best Chinese restaurant in the area; since we were new in town.  He pointed down the street and said Golden China......so my son and I gave it a try.

We walked in and were greeted by the friendly owner.  I mentioned that her place was referred to us; and she proceeded to tell us that they had been in business over 30 yrs...same location.   She was extremely warm and gracious.

I ordered a combination plate and my son had General chicken and we split a sweet and sour soup.  We received large portions of everything and the food was very, very tasty.

Ironically we had tried almost every Chinese restaurant in the area but somehow missed this one until today.

My son said what I was already thinking.....this will be our 'go to' Chinese restaurant from now on.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>To be honest, the food here wasn’t that great. After we ate, we waited 20 minutes until they asked us if we wanted a box for our food. And there was only one other couple next to us. No one checked up on us at all. So in short, I didn’t think they deserved a tip (we even had 3 different servers wait on us), and I left no tip as we weren’t well attended and waited 20 minutes to get a box of food. Another 10 to get our check and pay. After we left, our “waitress” had the nerve to chase us down on the street and say “you forgot MY tip” she didn’t take our order, give us the tea, take our check, or give us boxes. The only thing she did was she bring our food. Idk how she thought she deserved a tip and yet had the audacity to demand, even chasing us down outside. Never going back again.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Our regular go to place for take out. I think they have a new chef as some of the dishes have changed in flavor. Mostly for the better! Basil chicken is more saucy, mu shu pork has a lot more flavor and ingredients in it and the fried rice has much more meat in it. On the flip side, the dragon beef isn't as good. Sticky sweet and wet. Not crispy like it used to be. Service is good,Food is ready very quickly and they aim to please.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>This is the best Chinese food restaurant I've ever been to! There are so many healthy options, like the mix vegetables, and the green bean chicken. Everything is really flavorful, and the menu is large so there is a lot to choose from.<//review>< pics>

This place is consistent with making delicious Chinese food at extremely affordable prices. Plus, they always serve a mountain of food whether you dine-in or order to go. Customer service is great! Juan remembers the orders of returning customers, and that makes me feel appreciated and understand she's dedicated to providing the best customer service. My family and I have eaten here many times in the past and will continue returning!</text>

This KFC I frequently went to because the owners, personnel took pride in the food they were turning out...I won't be returning!
In the past, the chicken was crispy, moist, golden brown and not greasy. It looked as good as it tasted!
Now it's greasy! The flavor of the chicken is NASTY! It tastes like the oil hasn't been changed in MONTHS! The chicken is not pleasing to even look at, let alone eat! It's all BURNT!
The fries were so loaded with salt we had to toss them. The only part of the meal that was any good was the coleslaw. The biscuits looked OK. I don't eat them so I don't know if they were good or not.</text>

I used to like this place but 9/10 times they'll get something wrong with your order.  Ordered a piece of chicken breast and got a drum, it doesn't even sound similar, I need to stop going here.< /Review>

The best biscuits.
Southern style.
Must eat warm, fresh, just a little crispy.
Top with peanut butter and honey mixed together. Yummy.< /Text>

Ordered something through grubhub and I never got it. When I called the place, a man answered and he was being super sassy and unhelpful. He couldn't even track their own driver. Waste of time.<//text>

This place is small, but well organized. Very neat and clean. Staffs are very good and polite. They listen carefully about your order requirements and place the final order. They are very fast in delivering your order. I love little chicken. It seems in every season, they introduce new chicken dishes. Chickens are just Yummy. Still licking my fingers.</review>

old and gross inside. Makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like. No A.C., which can't be good when you have food or for the workers. I will never eat at this location. Customer service was great though.</text>

<rating>3< /rating><text>This place is best described as "eh". It's a dump, no question. Service, sometimes it is great, sometimes I'm amazed how bad it is. Usually it's "eh".

The chicken and sides usually aren't bad. Some KFC do a much better job but most don't. It is what it is. The Colonel is long gone so QC from a corporate level is non-existent.

If you want KFC just go here. All the other ones in the area are hit and miss. Same as this location. The one in Westminster sometimes is great, near perfect chicken and sides. But then to average out to 3 stars they have some real lows. At least this location is fairly consistent. You won't be wowed, but you also won't be driven to climb under a table and cry.<//text><GmapID>0x80dd2716b2f13ae3:0xb98fb18220fdb387< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

KFC is a problematic chain. It could cook really nice food, I mean, no rival chicken. However they seem to struggle at maintaining a consistent taste and quality across different areas, or among different stores in the same area. I have been really disappointed by the KFCs of Seattle area, as people can refer to the online reviews. I noticed LA area KFCs have significantly higher scores than Seattle ones. So I tried this one when I was in LA. Yes the reviews are correct. This KFC cooks fresh, tender, crispy chicken. Satisfied! Believe me, when KFC cooks the real KFC chicken, no other chicken can rival.<//review>

<Review>Wasn't that thrilled with there establishment or there customer service. There carelessness could have cost then my entire order which was well over 40.00 dollars when the guy forgot to collect the money from me.. (because he was too busy socializing in the back.) It's a good thing I'm honest and don't live life that way. I said did you want me to pay you and he's like oh $#!+ comes up laughing. No thanks for looking out. Or I appreciate your honesty here's a cake. Nothing.. He said oh $#!+ walked up laughing and then that was that. I had to ask another work for honey and butter they said its in the bag I'm like you sure they said yep. The one time I don't double check. It's only 2 honey 1 butter and I had 3 meals in hand. Nice right. Then again like I said carelessness. Which makes sense on why my entire order once I got home was not only COLD but the order was completely wrong as well. The soda machine drinks are always FLAT, blah. Was unhappy to say the least and it's happened on numerous visits at this particular location so I stopped going There and ill travel the few more miles from there to another location instead. Better tasting good kinder service better experience is well work it. T hats been at the brookhurst and garfield I believe location and the beach and talbert location are way better. Stay clear from brookhurst and Slater there foods not quality when your looking for the  him that KFC normally brings to your mouth.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I give it 4 stars only because you can tell that the building is really old. You might think twice about eating here .But I was surprise with the staff and how good the food was. They keep the place very cleaned.</Text>

This place looks so terrible inside that I almost threw up after being inside. This particular location ruins KFC's reputation. I got food poisoning after I ate here.</Review>< pictures>

The front staff don't know how to smile when i came to order & it seems rude when i order. I ordered 2 orders of monday special grilled chicken and i thought I did not ordered it right. So I asked if I ordered the grilled one and I was told "that what you said!", that's rude!<//text>

Food was good expect the Tooth pick that was in my Chimichanga and the service was less than good the waitress came asked for bill and 10 mins. Later she was still chatting it up with other guests paying and just having a good time .while I sat and waited.. poor customer service food was flavorful.</Text>

Been going here for over 15 years....always get the shrimp cocktail and a Pacifico with lime. Cocktail is packed with jumbo shrimp and a generous helping of avocado. Chips and salsa are always hot and freshly' home' cooked. Never disappointed.< /Review>

<Date>1581462749085</Date><rating>1<//rating><text>Food was average, at least from what I could tell by the miniscule portion provided as a "meal". Minimal chips and salsa offered initially and they don't offer "refills" on chips, which i would understand if it was a cafeteria style restaurant but you are seated with a waitress. Chips and salsa is the bare minimum for a Mexican restaurant.  Service
was poor. You get 1 free refill with the purchase of a fountain drink and it's an additional $1 charge if you want to take the drink to go. Customer service is quite obviously not high on their list of priorities. Service was poor, won't be returning.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c366e7085e0143:0xac26b5f3cce3cf0d< /gmap_id></record>

Absolutely a diamond site, stumbled on to this restaurant looking for something different than burgers or quick tacos. The waitress explained the different food plates and was very pleasant. I had the chicken Fajitas and my wife had the Menudo Soup, they were fantastic 5 stars for the cook and service..</text>

Had to give 4 stars because the nachos were boring and soggy. This was our first time trying them, figuring they would be great as their chips are freshly made, but they weren't. We won't be getting those again.< /Review>< pics>

All three of us got sick from three different items of food. The chili relleno, enchilada, and wet shrimp burrito all had the same sauce so that might have been what made us sick. The shrimp burrito was a joke there were about 4 shrimps chopped up very tiny through out the burrito which was filled with so much rice. Service was slow, we were the for over an hour and had to walk up to the front to ask for refills. We will not be going back</Text>

worst customer service experience ever. my bean burrito was served on a hot plate, yet my burrito was cold the beans inside were cold and the cheese inside wasnt melted. when i explained my concern to the waitress, she stuck it in the microwave and brought it back to me. the tortilla was so dough like, that i could not even hold it. She still wanted to charge us for it, even tho she had taken the burrito back untouched. she specifically told me in spanish , that she did not care if i liked the burrito or not. me and my family were visiting from out of state, and i hardly ever do reviews, but the food and the customer service, i had to warn others ! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE, NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY SERVE COLD FOOD ON HOT PLATES. AND THEY HAVE FLIES EVERWHERE!!!< /Text>

<Review>Have been in the restaurant and hospitality field for over 45 years, and have tried over 20 or 30 Mexican restaurants here in the HD, an was very surprised of how good this diamond in the rough was, someone posted how good it was, and now it's one of my favorite, it's not cheap, but taste and quality will be worth it, enjoy, Bill< /Review><Rate>4<//Rate>< response>

They advertise as a Chinese/Mexican place but I would definitely stick with the Chinese food though. I’m obsessed with their burritos though. It’s like a Chinese fusion burrito. Not quite sure how to describe it. Not like crazy delicious, but it’s an interesting flavor profile.</Review>

My first experience was awful, but I live close by and gave it another shot. I will certainly be back to try more! :)

I would recommend against the bbq pork with bone in, as it’s almost all bone and not meat; also, if you get broccoli beef let them know you what extra beef in it or you’ll get mostly steamed broccoli!
(hence from my bad first experience ha)

However, this time I tried different items and was pleasantly surprised. The egg rolls, fried rice/chow mien, orange chicken and spicy mushroom chicken are phenomenal! The food has a lot of zest and the portion sizes are insane considering the price. You are guaranteed to have leftovers for a few days!

If you’re balling on a budget, they do individual sales of items for $2 instead of an entire plate for $7.

Service is always fast a friendly! :)</Text>

Hidden gem!  Don't be fooled by the old dingy sign--this place is high quality with low prices.  Possibly he best fresh-made Chinese buffet-style food in the area!  Combos + a la carte.  Vegetables are crisp, meat is plentiful, servings are absolutely huge, I mean they stuff those take-out containers to capacity.  The orange chicken is crisp, tender + gorgeously flavorful.  Beef with broccoli is very good, Kung Pao chicken is another favorite.  Foodland beats all those chain Chinese places hands-down.  They also have Mexican food which I haven't tried but chances are it's done well because these people can really cook.< /review>

<Text>I ordered Asada Fries. The asada was not asada, but a soft non steak like texture. No cheese, sour cream, or guacamole. It was a sauce that was drizzled on that tasted like a version of thousand island dressing. Not an item I'll be reordering.<//Text>< pics>

Food was good,  very large portion. 2 choices with the option of fried rice and or chow mein, portion enough for two. And I'm a big eater. Choice of ready made 10 course(Beef & Brocc, spicy diced chicken with mushroom, zucchini, 2 different fried chicken,  teri chicken,  orange chicken, cooked bananas,  etc.) menu, or your choice of the house menu. My only issue which was minor,  tables were not wiped down from previous customers. But we took care of that ourselves. Small restaurant near a catholic church and good samaritan hospital, within walking distance.</review>

I came here twice to install tires, for two different vehicles. One was a lifted pick-up truck with oversized tires, the other one was just a normal car. While most places do small tires fine, they generally can't handle big off-road wheels well, especially in the Bay Area where most people drive smaller vehicles. These guys did a fine job on both vehicles. The truck took about an hour (I was also replacing the spare tire, so that's 5 wheels), the car was about half an hour. They have a spacious seating area and I was able to make myself coffee, pull out my laptop and just do some work while they were taking care of the wheels. I really admire how well they did with the truck. Those are some big tires and there is absolutely no vibration or anything. I drove there from Oakland and it was worth it.
BTW, while I was waiting, I could see how they treat their customers: both in person and over the phone. They were professional, honest, no BS. Highly recommend this place.</Review>

This place has great service. I've been several times for standard maintenance work. They're super friendly and professional - family owned... Bathroom is clean. The lounge area is comfortable with free coffee. They even let me borrow a charging block when my phone battery was low and all I had was my cord from my car charger. I really appreciated that. You'll be well taken care of here.< /text>

<text>Staff was friendly. They got down to business, just like they should. Tire service technician missed the mark balancing my tires though. Crazy vibes starting after 60 mph. I'll get them rebalanced.<//text>< name>

I really like how they gave me a free courtesy inspection on my oil change. Plus I got a free tire rotation. Most shops charge for those two things. I like how they are honest and explain to me what is wrong with my vehicle. They even showed me I'm person the fault! Trust worthy people.<//Review>

I got a flat tire today and went to this nearest tire repair shop after I found the problem.  The sales person assesses my tire and recommended replacement with a quote.  I ended up drove my car to the car dealer to replace the tires as I want the replacement record to be kept in their system for potential resale. The Toscalito folks put no pressure on me and they nicely flated my flat tire so I can make my drive to the car dealer. Very professional, respectful and responsible.  Thank you very much! I will use your service next time and recommend to my friends!<//Text>

I went in to replace a flat tire. I asked for a brake inspection as well to check the brakes. I went in by 9am. Bob told me that it would be done long before 5pm. They close at 5:30. He lied. I got my van back at 5:40. I had to reschedule an appointment and risk a fee for not showing up.
They did good work, were polite as they could be, but it took way longer than estimated. And no apology.<//text>

<text>The Saizan Team is simply awesome and I hope to work with them again if ever I sell/buy a home. The agent that personally worked with me, Justin, was extremely helpful throughout the process. This was the first time I bought a home, and Justin was always willing to answer any questions I had (very quickly too!), as well as some very useful advice throughout the home buying process. The team never once tried to pressure me to view/consider properties that went beyond the price range I was looking at. Chris Saizan has an outstanding team that made the entire process easy for me.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Amazing experience!!! Chris and his team took the time to walk through all the tough stuff and helped us prepare our house to sell. They know exactly what it takes to help you buy or sell a house. They successfully got us top dollar for our home. We are truly happy!!!< /Text>

My Realtor, Stephanie Barden (Keller Williams - Chris Saizan Group), was extremely knowledgeable about the area , real estate trends, other local realtors. She recommended a great painter and met him to get him started on the job. As I lived out of town, she also was there for inspections, vendor quotes and more. What was most valued was her thought process on our decision in accepting the best offer. We closed on time and received $27,500 over the asking price.</review>

Chris and his team were very knowledgeable and made our selling experience seamless. They are very connected to the local market and their recommendations paid off with a selling price over asking. Natasha coordinated all of the details And was very friendly and efficient. I would go with the Chris Saizan team again!< /Text>

Chris Saizan was the listing broker on 2 properties that I sold last year. Chris  was a tremendous help in preparing my properties for sale and helping negotiate with the buyer's realtor to get sales prices greater than the asking price. Because of Covid restrictions and major surgery that my wife had, I was unable to do anything to update the properties. Chris took over that task and identified updates to the properties that would increase the sales price. He arranged for workmen to make the necessary improvements. His instincts as to what changes would increase the value was right-on. I listed a condo and had 4 offers in 3 days, my duplex had 11 offers in 4 days. I have recommended Chris to a number of friends.</Text>

We were first time homebuyers and very confused on the entire home buying process, but Justin made the whole process super easy! When we found our perfect home, we had questions about the solar and septic systems. Justin went above and beyond to get us answers to those questions, ultimately making our jobs easier. Justin also always made us feel like we were his only clients, being very responsive to texts and calls. We couldn't have picked a better realtor!<//Review>

We recently decided to sell our home. I was feeling nervous about the timing and dealing with COVID. So much uncertainty in the world we are living in. Working with Stephiane Braden was a great experience. She was very personable and made the process so fast and hassle free. Paper work was organized and a detailed timeline was given for each step. Stephanie stayed in contact with us constantly updating us. I’m so thankful for the timing of our sale and how everything worked out. I feel if it were not for Stephanie and her team we would have lost out on a wonderful opportunity. We will definitely be recommending her to our neighbors.</review>

Chris Saizan and his team helped me from A to Z during the process, including rehabbing and remodeling the property so it looked brand new.  Thanks to Chris's remodeling eye and marketing acumen, he managed to create a bidding war, and the property sold much over asking price.  I am very grateful and recommend that people use Chris every time they need to buy or sell in Sacramento!</text>

<Date>1573695094816<//Date><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I highly recommend Chris Saizan and his team to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.  Most agents can sell a house but very very few know how to get maximum value.  Chris listed my wife’s grandmother’s home after she passed and I was shocked by just how much he does to prepare a house before he lists it.  She had a dog that pretty much destroyed the carpet and rather than just telling us to just have it cleaned he went the extra distance and had it replaced…along with the baseboards!  The linoleum in the kitchen was extremely outdated so he had his guys come in and put some new flooring in.  He made sure that the house was staged properly and had an updated look so that the house would sell for OVER the asking price.  There was one snag in the process but it only highlights just how ‘above and beyond’ Chris goes for his clients.  When the workers were finished with the flooring they somehow had lost the key and weren’t able to lock the house.  The garage was full of antiques and my mother-in-law was rightfully worried that someone would be able to gain access over the weekend.  What did Chris do?  He contacted a locksmith…on his own dime…to get over the house and change all of the locks so that my mother-in-law didn’t have to worry!  When all was said and done, Chris was able to get $35,000 over the asking price.  Chris and his team are simply the best!<//review>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>In 2017 Chris guided our daughter and son-in-law in the purchasing of their first home, so we knew we could trust him, Justin, and the whole excellent team at The Chris Saizan Group when it came time for us to purchase our home in West Sacramento. We honestly don't know what we would have done without Justin and Chris’s guidance, experience and support during the purchasing process. They kept in constant contact with us the entire time and always provided us with perfect advice. Justin and Chris’s extensive knowledge of the West Sacramento housing market, connections with other real estate agents and service vendors in the area made the short 28-day escrow go as smoothly as possible. They protected us the entire time, and dealt with issues, so we didn’t have to. Most importantly, they handled everything, and it reduced the stress that we were under. We strongly recommend Chris and Justin to any person who is looking to buy or sell a home. We are grateful for their patience, trustworthiness and expertise. Thank you to the whole Chris Saizan team!

Justin Sorba has great customer service, knowledge in the real estate industry, and is always available to answer your questions. He takes the time to listen to your needs and wants in a home. It’s is very hard to find someone that is honest and hardworking as him.

I thought buying a home would be a lot of stress but he took me through all the steps of the process before hand.< /Text>

We used Chris Saizan to sell our house in 2020.  Chris is friendly, knowledgeable and professional.  He gave us great advice on pre-listing steps to take to better present our property and connected us with reasonably priced contractors who accomplished the work quickly with great results.  Chris recommended staging our house, which we were considering already but I had no idea just how fantastic the results would turn out to be. He uses a professional photographer and videographer which made such a big difference.  Bottom line, our house sold for a fantastic price in only ten days and we even had a backup offer in the wings.  If you are looking for a true pro who knows real estate and how best to market it, you're looking for Chris Saizan.<//Review>

We cannot say enough good things about Chris Saizan and his real estate team. In our first meeting, Chris exuded confidence about his real estate background and knowledge, and was well informed about trends and comparable properties in the Sacramento market and our local area. He urged us to list sooner rather than later, and we are convinced this got us top dollar for our home. Chris and his team got our home list-ready in less than two weeks. A staging company and amazing artwork from a local gallery were brought in to make our home look its absolute best. After the first round of open houses, we had two full price offers. Chris then negotiated diligently for us and got us an offer that was significantly over asking price. In addition to Chris' expertise, he is also backed by a competent team that answered all our questions, scheduled all the appointments and made the whole process very low stress. We are beyond pleased that we sold our home for top dollar in record time. Thank you Chris Saizan and your wonderful team!< /review>

I highly recommend Stephanie Barden. She was knowledgeable, hardworking, responsive and savvy. She got our property listed right away, and sold it for $10k over asking. I was  impressed by her strategies and professionalism. She also didn’t take up a lot of our time. We were able to get the transaction done with very little work on my end. Much appreciated because life is busy enough already! So glad I chose to work with Stephanie.< /Text>

I am a third-time homebuyer and first-time seller. I used The Chis Saizan Group to purchase and sell a home in 2020. I am happy to have found Chris and would use him again. Chris and his team (Justin and Denora) are hardworking and have been there for me throughout every step of the process. They answered all my questions and responded quickly. I couldn’t be happier with The Chris Saizan Group.<//text>

Chris and his team are by far one the most dynamic groups in the industry. They care not only about helping their clients financially, but also personally. They really listen to those they work with to ensure the the best final outcome. If you are looking for a real estate team that is ready to work with and for you... look no further. They will blow your mind!!< /Text>

<Text>My husband and I used Chris and his team to sell our home in Oak Park and we definitely made the right choice! Chris was a consummate professional from start to finish, and even though our home was on the lower-end of Sacramento home prices, he and his team still made our property a priority and made us feel like valued clients. I had many questions and he and Denora worked together to make sure I had answers in a very timely fashion. Chris gave us great advice on affordable improvements we could make to maximize our sale price, and also offered guidance on how to "stage" the home since we were still living in it. We agreed on a list price and had multiple offers within 48 hours of listing. Chris expertly guided us through the  process of negotiating and we ended up in contract at about 6% OVER list price. Thanks to Chris and Denora, we had an incredibly smooth escrow and closed in only 28 days!

We will not hesitate to use Chris again if we buy or sell in the greater Sacramento area. I can truly say that Chris is one of the BEST and will do right by you if you choose to work with him.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Name>

While I have not personally used Chris to buy or sell a house, I recommended one of my clients that I know in Sacramento to use him. He was incredibly pleased with his services. He had been struggling to buy a house, had made a couple of offers with another realtor, getting nowhere. Chris got him into a house with a 1st offer. His experience truly gets results quickly.< /Review>

Stephanie Barden at The Chris Saizon Group is simply unreal. We have never experienced customer service at such a personal level. Stephanie was always available to us. There were times when we felt like we were her only client when this clearly was not the case. Stephanie takes great care to hear her clients and she went above and beyond for my partner and me. We are so thankful that Stephanie helped find our forever home. Her work ethic is unreal, her positive attitude made a scary decision exciting, and her honesty and reliability made her a true friend to us. THANK YOU STEPHANIE and thank you Chris Saizon Group. We will forever recommend you to anyone who even mentions that they are looking for a home.</text>

<text>Not only was Chris fun to work with, he's also an excellent agent! He helped me price my home perfectly so it sold quickly with minimal effort, which I needed since I'd made a contingency offer on my dream retirement home. He also spent an hour on the phone with the listing agent for my retirement home and convinced the agent his seller should accept my offer over another one without a contingency. That was a bonus having Chris help me not only with the sale but also my new purchase.  I highly recommend Chris to anyone looking to either buy or sell a home!</text>< pictures>

<review>I am extremely happy with the home buying experience I had with Chris this year.  He's a great guy, a consummate professional, and worked hard to connect me with the home that fit my lifestyle and my budget.  I love my house and Chris has continued to help me by providing introductions to contractors and useful contacts has made home ownership easy.  It seems like everyone in Sacramento knows Chris and his network and knowledge of the community are incredibly valuable resources that take him to the next level as an agent. Couldn't recommend Chris more if you're looking to buy in Sacramento.</review>< pictures>

As a first time home buyer, I had many questions and needed a realtor who would listen and explain everything to me - Chris was that person! I am glad that we found him. Chris made the home buying process easy. I had so many questions along the way and Chris was always there to help. Chris explained the home buying process to me and my family. He listened to what we were looking for in our new home and very carefully showed us properties that met our criteria.

Chris was honest and gave us his true opinion on the properties we saw. Chris was very responsive and would get back to me in a timely manner. I am very impressed with his level of professionalism and customer service. Throughout the process we never felt pressured to make decisions and that was a huge relief. With the help of Chris we were able to purchase our first home and love our new home! Thank you Chris!!< /review>

My wife and I met Chris through my brother Kevin. My brother had spoken highly of him and knew he would take care of us. We purchased our first home with Chris’ help and we couldn’t have been happier with the job he did. Throughout the entire process he was professional, knowledgeable, and trustworthy. He took our complete lack of real estate knowledge in stride and answered (honestly and candidly) every question we could come up with. He was even supportive of us when we only wanted to search within a specific area so that our son could finish his last two years of high school without changing schools. He was very honest by pointing out specific challenges we would face in wanting to stick with one area but made us comfortable in knowing it could be accomplished. At no point did we feel any pressure to make an offer on a home that wasn’t perfect for us. We quickly came to trust his instincts. He was always available when we would send him messages and on more than one occasion we toured potential homes immediately after we first saw the listing. Since we were searching in such a limited area this kind of availability was crucial. We surely weren’t his only clients but he kept in constant communication throughout the process until we finally got it! Without his help we would not be currently living in the house we WANTED. We’ll definitely work with Chris again and will recommend him to anyone looking for an OUTSTANDING REALTOR.</Review>

Three times in the last 5 years I've worked with Chris and the Saizan Group.  Twice selling houses. Once buying.  On each sale, I got more than I thought I would, and the houses sold quickly. The second sale happened less than 24 hours after listing!  And when buying, he was able to help me negotiate a good deal while avoiding a bidding war.  I can definitely recommend Chris and the Saizan Group.< /review>

<text>I’ve never seen an agent go to bat for their clients the way Chris does. Since working with him I’ve seen him go to great lengths to make sure his clients are happy and supported. They say the biggest compliment in real estate is a referral...Chris is complimented constantly. Its amazing to see how many customers come back to him and how many of his customers refer them.

His passion and integrity for his business and real estate is evident in each transaction he does. His goal is to not only make the transaction smooth for his client, but for the other party and agents as well.

I feel truly honored to be able to work with Chris. In the short time we have been working together I have already learned so much and I’m so thankful for his investment in my success. I feel immense pride working with Chris and growing the Saizan team with its clear vision and dedication to ensuring our clients are given the most amazing real estate experience possible.<//text>< Pics>

Chris helped me find the perfect condo shortly after relocating to Sacramento from Chicago.  He was more than willing and eager to show me any properties I was interested in, at a moments notice.  The condo I purchased was in probate but posed no obstacle to Chris.  He submitted my "below asking price" offer and we closed in a matter of weeks!  Would definitely recommend Chris to anyone looking to buy or sell and will definitely call on Chris for my next move.< /review>

He made me feel very comfortable and the home searching process was very quick and enjoyable. He has been working in real estate for a long time and has many connections. Once I had selected the home that I wanted to buy he went straight to his office to draw up the offer. He luckily knew the listing agent which definitely helped. Once my offer was accepted Chris kept me well informed during the escrow process. He was quick to answer any questions that I had for him. He had a team of inspectors for home and pest that were very informative and professional. The transaction closed very smoothly and I am very happy in my new home. I recommend using Chris for any of your real estate needs. He is amazing at what he does and also is a really honest, knowledgeable, funny and great guy!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<name>Kenneth Carson<//name><Review>As an Elk Grove resident, it's been very clear over the past few months that the selling market is hotter than ever.  We were curious, so I requested a market analysis from Chris.  Within the same afternoon, Chris advised that the equity in our home might be worth pursuing, so we pulled the trigger.

Chris hired a professional photographer, and took all the necessary steps to get our home in perfect showing condition.  His marketing and pricing couldn't have been set up any better, and within 24 hours we had people banging down the door with cash offers well above listing price.  We didn't have to do a single thing; Chris managed all communication and offers with ease.  Before we knew it, we were in contract!

Chris is the real deal.  He's aggressive, he's an expert in his market, and he works his butt off to eliminate the stress of buying and/or selling.  5 stars times 2.</Review>< Response>

Chris and his team did an exceptional job selling our home. I would recommend them to any friends, family, or whomever is looking to buy, or sell their home. We sold our home in the beginning of 2017 and Chris and his team were able to get us multiple offers over asking in the first week as promise. When we are ready to buy a home we don't need to look for a realtor, we already have the best in Nor Cal! Thank you Chris and your exceptional team for making the process so easy for us! Look forward to doing business in the future!< /text>

Chris Saizan is a winner!  I can attest that he is patient and conscientious in caring for his listings.
He took incredibly good care of my sister-in-law in a sale that took some time to come to market.
I have seen how he researches and knows his market - he has what it takes to make your sale happen!
I heartily recommend Chris Saizan and Keller Williams for your next real estate transaction!</Text>

Chris came to us based on a recommendation from a friend and he and team lived up to those high expectations. In fact, he helped us both in the selling and buying of our homes- and both transactions went super smoothly. We appreciate the responsiveness and professionalism and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend Chris and co. Thanks, guys!< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience working with Chris and his team at Keller Williams.  As a professional fiduciary it is critical that I work with someone who is experienced, understands trust and probate laws, is overall flexible and understands how to read the market to best recommend a listing price for the property.  They were so easy to work with and on top of everything, I never had one worry.</text>

Chris is awesome and did an amazing job keeping us optimistic, focused on the prize and sane! After 6 months of searching (and numerous offers), we found "our" home in the neighborhood we wanted to be in! Once we went into contract we closed in 28 day and on time! We have been in our home for a little over a month now and still can't believe it is ours! Love it! Thanks for everything Chris and team!</Review>

At our first meeting with Chris, he laid out the entire process of buying a home and gave us realistic goals. He explained the process very well and was there every step of the way. Phone calls and emails were always promptly responded to and the process went very smoothly as a result of his diligence.< /review>

<review>We have both bought and sold a house with Chris Saizan. Working with Chris made the buying/selling processes seamless. I had endless questions and felt so uneasy at first texting/calling him all the time. After just a few conversations, though, my husband and I felt like we were his only clients. Regardless of how busy he was he always had time for our questions and responded almost immediately. Even when he didn't have the exact answer I was looking for, he would let me know he was on it and would get back to me as soon as he could.

I really felt like Chris was an advocate for us as both buyers and sellers. He always took the lead and filled in where our knowledge of the process failed us. He worked really with our mortgage lender and helped simplify the jargon for us so we could really understand what was happening.

Every time our idea of what we were looking for in a house changed, Chris had 4 or 5 more houses to show us almost overnight. He never left us feeling like we needed to reach out to him for a response. He anticipated our needs and really walked us through everything. We could never have done it without him.

Working with Chris is like working with a friend. Aside from his stellar professional abilities, his personality and values are top notch. He is a great person who loves to laugh and make you feel comfortable in a situation that is sometimes overwhelming. Through working with Chris we have gained a life long realtor and a friend.

I highly recommend him to everyone. At least give him a call and see for yourself. You won't be sorry!</review><date>1457721846634<//date>< user>

Chris and his assistant Amanda made our experience of purchasing our first home easy and without issue! They are very responsive to phone calls and emails (and believe me, I probably called too much with too many questions!), explained every step of the process to us, and help to ensure that we closed on time and without issue. Without a doubt, we recommend Chris as a realtor to all of our friends!< /review>

Unfortunately, in today's real estate world it seems those times are more and more rare.  And excellence is nearly extinct; especially in the business world.  In this case, I am taking the time to address the performance of Chris Saizan.  Mr. Saizan is more than competent and perhaps even more than excellent.  He actually achieves.  His clients are clients for life.  He cannot promise results, no one can.  But he can and does promise focused, professional, resourceful and experienced action.  I have seen more results from this man in five years than I saw from other agents in twenty-five years.  If you ever have the opportunity to work with him, don't miss it.< /text>< Rating>

Chris did an excellent job walking me through the process. I was a first time home buyer and had no idea what I was doing, what my options were, or how to pick a good home for me. Chris was able to listen to my needs, find me a great home, and negotiate for a great deal. There was an issue with a major repair that needed to be done that I was very worried about, and Chris took care of all the details and made sure we only closed 2 days late, despite having an entire new HVAC system installed. Nothing but the utmost confidence I was taken care of through the whole process.<//review>

<review>Great Experience with a Great Team!

We cannot say enough for all the hard work Chris and his team put in to find us the perfect home. As first-time home buyers, we did not know what to expect and the entire process seemed daunting. Lucky, we found Chris. His experience and expertise was evident from the first time we met with him. He took the time to get to know us and what we needed in a home. This translated into a healthy list of potential homes.

Justin was also great. We could always tell he did his homework on the homes he showed us and went above and beyond to answer all our questions. He was professional, but personable at the same time and helped us talk through our feelings with each home.

When we finally found the perfect home, unexpectedly, things actually got even easier. What would have been a mess of documents and files were all electronic. The entire process was streamlined and the turnaround was almost instant. We feel like this and Chris’s go-getter attitude helped us win out over multiple offers.

We had no idea how many things have to happen after an offer is accepted on a home. Luckily again, Chris’s team had a recipe for success. Michala took care of all the coordination of inspections, appraisals, meetings, documents, deadlines, and kept us informed of everything going on. What would have been a stressful month was actually smooth sailing. We closed on the perfect home and had a wonderful experience doing it.

To put it simply, Chris and his team made buying a home easy!</review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x809ada59e71d456d:0xc0ab2c5239b9d0f2< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>My mother was interested in purchasing a condo (her first real estate purchase) and I could think of nobody I would rather send her to than Chris Saizan.  He took excellent care of her and she was in contract within 30 days of making the decision to purchase a condo.  I could not be happier with his performance and would recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.</Review>< gmapID>

Chris and company helped me find the perfect home. He is highly motivated to seek out what you are looking for and goes the extra mile to negotiate. The purchase of my home was an exciting, fun, and smooth process! :)< /Review>

<text>Selling my house was an emotional decision, it was my first house, a huge accomplishment. Chris was a huge help at walking me the process! Him and his awesome assistant Amanda made the experience fun, they are super friendly and down to earth! Not once did I ever question if I was working with the right team!!!

Chris was absolutely amazing when I needed to sell my mother's home to pay for Alzheimer's care. He came up with a very appropriate listing price and so multiple bids came in, ensuring the final accepted offer was actually above listed price. Ensuring qualified buyers, escrow was closed in less than a month!
He was excellent with my mother and in understanding the difficulty she faced with the Alzheimer's. He helped me make this a much smoother transition for her. He, also, went above and beyond by appearing in Family court when we moved my POA to my conservatorship. What an amazing realtor and gentleman.<//text>

Buying a home for the first time can be  intimidating especially when you and your wife’s parents and grandparents never had property of their own. All anxiety, questions, and fears were answered, and comforted by Justin and Denora of the Keller Williams :Christopher Saizan group. They not only did they listened to our request, but they offered some suggestions without making us feel pressured. I would use them every time I’m ready to buy or sell, and I would highly recommend them to friends and family.< /text>

So glad I called Loural Towing last night when my son and I were stranded with a puncture in our tire that left us stranded on an exit ramp in Redwood City. They were there within 10 mins of calling them, towed our car to their shop where they patched the tire so we could get home safely. They took great care with my car the entire time and were very professional. We were off after 45 mins after calling them.<//review>

<Text>These guys are the best I got a flat and destroyed my tire stem.  I called the auto club and they sent loural towing.  On a lark I asked the tow truck driver if he had a tire I could buy and he called his shop and sure enough they had a used tire that was perfect for my car.  It only cost 45 dollars and I looked at the tire a few days later and it is a nice premium tire.  I totally appreciate the tow driver and the shop for getting me back on the road that day.  I was able to complete my trips and get my bonus from uber.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808fa3ae65accedd:0xc0e38b966578ae3< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

These guys are thiefs are liars.
My car broke down and I called their  services.
The place I intended to take it to was closed so they offered to fix my rims/wheels/tires. They promised they were going to have it ready within 2 days and with the new wheels the car was going to be fine, however it took them more than a week, I paid them over $700    and the car was far from being ok, it was shaking and when  I took it back they said I nedneea new: axel, suspention, cross member, etc etc. But they only quoted me on the wheel and tires and that was separate, so I asked, why did you tell me it was only the tires then? If I would had known it needed all these extra stuff, I may have or not fix it.
I was angry, but there was nothing I could have done, so two months later I asked for a receipt and they had the balls to tell me that if I wanted one I had to pay them $40 for a copy of it. That's how bad they are, they won't have your car on the date they told you, they will charge you for something and when that's not the problem and they will charge you for your receipt.< /Text>

It was an AWESOME experience! I love it. We did have to wait a while, but that was due to weather conditions. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Overall loved the staff especially Jennifer she’s awesome! My instructor David Minnis is awesome  and Sarah behind the camera is awesome . Amazing footage! Would definitely do it again.<//Text>

Had my very first jump ever today! Overall was an amazing experience! Brian was my tandem expert, he made jokes and helped me ease out my nerves. He was incredibly knowledgeable and made me feel safe. He set the bar incredibly high for my future tandems.
I was not particularly fond of one of the staff, I believe her name was Kelsey or something similar. She was the one setting up the jumps. She came off with an unfriendly and stressful demeanor and kind of gave me anxiety, didn't seem welcoming. I also noticed how she yelled at people and seemed to get easily irritable. But maybe she was just having a bad day. Other than her, everyone was incredibly friendly, welcoming, and personable- from staff to instructors, to the entire community of regulars.
Definitely want to jump again.<//text>

Absolutely the best experience. I was debating between this and the one in Perris but just from the phone convo with customer service I knew this  would be my ideal place for first time. So booking was very easy over the website. We were running late due to traffic and they were super understanding. Yes the wait was about 3 hours but honestly they tell you the wait will be 2-4. So just come prepared! It’s worth it. They were so nice and talked me through the whole thing. Best experience ever! I plan to go again and again!<//review>

<Name>Honey Badger</Name><review>Really great experience, and amazing vibes all around. The on site food truck that was there today I believe is always there. And the burrito I ordered was not only massive but was amazing.
I might would go back just for the burrito but I can rarely pass up on a good jumping experience with a very welcoming community of jumpers.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dc9b0de03f4dc3:0x5ffe018cfc0e8559<//Gmap_id><time>1618116010242< /time>< rate>

I did a static line jump with these folks back in 1980. Truly an amazing experience. Practice jumps were done off a platform into a sand pit. I will never forget right before I jumped, I looked back at the guy behind me and eyes had rolled up into his head. They had a contest for whoever yelled the loudest would win a case of beer. My roommate and I were on his motorcycle and he won the beer and it was interesting traveling with the case of beer< /text>

If it's your first time bring cash if you'd like to tip your instructor and cameraman.
Eat a little bit of something before you jump to help keep you energized.
Bring Gatorade or something similar for after.
Most important.  Have fun! It's a great experience!< /Text><date>1602431646417</date>< Resp>

So I was driving home with my family and we saw a beam of light...we followed it to Skydive Elsinore and ended up seeing a low-key, really cool skydive show which I think was sponsored by Red Bull.  The sky divers were dropped by a plane and then had some rockets to launch themselves around in the sky for a bit, before squirreling down with a small chute.  Um whoa!</review>

All I can say is AWESOME!! The instructors are the greatest. Plus all the fellow jumpers were so very cordial and supportive. Also I want to mention I made this one jump to honor all veterans and current military members, especially my old outfit the 82nd Airborne Division.<//review>

Shout out and much love to G for capturing these memories and my instructor Christian Bicker for an amazing experience, flawlessly backflipping us off the plane & the most graceful landing! 🤩🪂 Even tho I’ve skydived before, Christian still went over proper skydiving form with me- which I appreciated! Christian made me feel safe by constantly making sure my harness was secure while we were on the ground and while he was attaching/tightening our harnesses together in the plane. Glad I was partnered with an awesome team to talk to during my Skydive Elsinore experience!

Skydive Elsinore made the booking & paperwork easy and efficient online, with only a few more papers to sign when you get there- thanks to Shauna for giving my friends and I all the information we needed!

My friends and I booked for the 12:30pm slot, but next time we’ll book for an earlier slot to be mindful of the heat. I wore shorts just barely long enough for the harness to not rub against my skin thankfully.

Thanks again Skydive Elsinore, we’ll be back!< /Review>

<date>1620380999312</date><rate>5< /rate><Text>I was sceptical at first. Took a couple hours from check in to take off. Even after the check in process. Got a little stir crazy but as soon as my buddy and I were met by our tandem instructors it was worth it. My buddy was strapped to Dillain (sorry if i mispelt your name) and i was with Luis. He appeared to be about my age if not a year or two younger. Both dudes went above and beyond in terms of making sure we were comfortable but also giving us a 100% experience. I wanted to to flip at least once and luis basically read my mind and asked if I was ok with doing a flip. After that he was extremely accommodating to making sure i was having fun. After we landed he even said to me "thanks for the skydive" like I was the one pulling his chute. Overall amazing time. Even considering doing my first solo dive at this place to get certified. They're not lying. Its addicting</Text>< Pics>

For my first tandem I asked Adrian (the guy I was strapped to) to do something crazy. He gave me such a wonderful experience, I would recommend this to anyone on the fence about giving this a try. The jumpers are very experienced, knowledgeable, and willing to work with your needs (such as do something crazy). Adrian, thank you for an amazing jump.< /Review>

Sarah ad Seth were AMAZING tandem instructors.  My wife and i went for our anniversary and we're SO GLAD we did.
Communication was clear, the instructors were safe, professional, fun, and reassuring.    My wife and I are already talking about jumping again.
We questioned the photo/video hand-cam package and it was 100% worth it.  The photos are incredible, the video is incredible - and the video is nicely produced, not just rough shots.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK9KI9HzaZDfXwJY6HJ_37iiU-TIgaRconBqdM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhQNfyX7RSHZBbM94-q3mNj4eCIfORlypR0bDR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpfdLVXGc9tOKPI_nytOWTXAQBLYzo6WExl7UA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>What an amazing experience from start to finish. The entire place has a really great vibe. Lots of space to bring friends and family. It’s a whole experience. Parking is easy and the facilities are very clean. If it’s your first time jumping, choose Elsinore skydiving. You won’t regret it.< /Text></record>

<text>Skydive Elsinore gave me a great experience on my first skydive. Andy was super cool instructor who made it easy the whole way through from getting strapped in to landing. The office staff was friendly and informative, I did have a lot of questions and they were patient with me. Everyone was accommodating and I had a great time. I will definitely be back, and I think I will try a solo jump! I can't wait!<//text>< pictures>

Amazing place to skydive! The crew is so sweet and they hype you up the whole time. My first jump there was with Murph and he was so great!! He made me feel so comfortable and was so fun to jump with. I went again and took my mom for her first time and requested him for her and she also had such a great experience!< /text>

Girls in the front are not really friendly . I was over charged and I’ve called twice asking about my refund. They claim the manager has to do it. I don’t think I’m getting the refund, so make sure you check your total. Now the experience, it was my first time jumping and I was so excited. I know they have jumped hundreds of times but they can at least pretend to be excited for the sake of customer service. They were just super quiet which made me even more nervous. Needless to say I won’t be going back.< /text>

Absolutely enjoyed my tandem skydive here, very reasonable price with excellent support of the tandem trainer (Bee) . The place is pretty neat n you can spend an entire day just watching colourful chutes coming down in style. Parking is available but again limited space, but you can always park a little farther. They give a certificate as well. Also the photos were sent to your email on the same day itself, very prompt indeed. I would revisit very soon. Keep up the good work guys!< /review>

This was my first experience. My instuctor Alexsey was the best. He made the whole experience fun from the beginning to landing.

I also recommend getting their pro video and photo package, the price is worth it. Overall, amazing experience, everyone should try.<//review>

I signed up for Skydive Elsinore's "Accelerated Freefall Level 1" in part because I'm terrified of heights, and in part because my friend was and I didn't want him to go alone.  (AFF means you jump with an instructor on either side, but you are jumping yourself, controlling yourself, and land your own parachute, vs a tandem jump where the instructor is strapped to you and can handle any aspects of the jump you don't want to)

The campus is cool.  There's definitely a "bro" vibe, but it's not overpowering. Everyone is super friendly and excited.  Everyone is willing to answer questions and wants to help, from instructors to random jumpers.

Once you get into classroom, the facility gets very professional and it reminded me of a more intimate, more friendly Army classroom.

The instructors were patient and detail oriented.  We drilled a LOT on the ground, including how to handle every conceivable type of emergency, with a lot of visual aids and exercises which left me confident I could get safely to ground no matter what happened. We even practiced exit procedures from what I think may have been the real tail sections of decommissioned planes.

The aircraft I went up in felt very new (and even had modern avionics, which I was not expecting at all)

In the air, even though I had poor body position the instructors kept me on track and were re-assuring, friendly, supportive and professional.

The landing pattern which seemed scary and narrow when I was on the ground looking at maps was super easy to navigate from the air and landing, just like all the in-air exercises were very easy because the instructors had taken their time to drill the process over and over on the ground.

I can not think of a single complaint. I am over the moon happy with Skydive Elsinore and give them an unqualified recommendation.< /Review>

<review>I would highly recommend Skydive Elsinore! I did the AFF Level 1 jump for my 60th birthday and everyone I came in contact with from the initial set up to the final jump were extremely helpful and professional. I came in contact with 4 different instructors between my class and my jump and they all gave me a level of confidence and comfort. There were 4 other jumpers in my group who did tandem and everyone we came in contact with from check in staff, instructors, photographers, pilots were all very friendly and made you feel part of their family. Awesome experience. Thank you Skydive Elsinore!< /review>< Pictures>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Overall I had a nice experience here with my husband. The wait time was 2.5 hours after check in for us which I understood cause we did show up 30 minutes late. I believe we were the last jumpers, so am pretty sure our trainers weren't as enthused as they first started out. If your a first time jumper ofcourse your nerves are gonna be through the roof 😳 but I tried to act calm as possible. My camera girl was awesome. She kept the same energy throughout even tho I was nervous. My husband jumped with Bee if I'm not mistaken...He said she was awesome and made him feel comfortable which is very important. Now for some tips... cause they don't seem to give much of that. Take earbuds, I came down with an earache. For my girls with weaves, wrap it up, braid it, or get you a special hair band hun. Take your earings out, I lost my 500 bucks gold earring for being dumb...so take it all off sis. Wear a sweater, comfortable bra and some tights. Expect for your groin to be sore after lol. Take a snack and your headphones just in case you gotta wait hours...and that's about it. The rest of advice they give is on point. Remember you'll be fine. 🤘🏾</text>< user_name>

Adrian was an amazing and laid back tandem instructor. He helped take the edge off and I can't wait to jump again. I'll be back very soon and look forward to jumping with him again.

Thanks Adrian, you rock!</Text>

<text>I am from London and was recently on a California road trip wherein I decided to finally check Tandem Skydiving off my bucket list! Elsinore is a great place visually and I thought the pricing was just right too. When I got there, the staff and the friendly instructors there made me feel extremely comfortable. For anyone who's thinking of doing a Tandem jump here, I can assure you that it's worth it. The instructors here jump like 15-20 times a day, and are alive n fit! So you can be sure that they know what they are doing, their equipment doesn't fail, and they will try their best to ensure that it goes well for you. I bought the Pro package which ensured that a recording instructor flies with me. The recording instructors also do a fantastic job. They cover the whole thing as a story. So you have a full story at the end, and can re-live the moments later. I had a problem loading my video later, but they sorted me out in no time. My friend who jumped with me also had a great experience. All in all, this is a fantastic place for any experience - be it your first jump or the 200th! Well done team!<//text>< Time>

I celebrated my 30th birthday with a tandem jump at Skydive Elsinore! Kyle was my instructor and Dalten took the outside video/pictures. They are incredible people with the coolest jobs. I love the pictures and video and was surprised with a certificate and t-shirt. The dropzone is huge with a welcoming environment. Also loved that my husband and kids were able to hangout to watch me take off and land. Now I'm hooked and can't wait to return for the AFF course!< /review>

Just did a jump yesterday and it was scary at first but dont be scarred, the best things in life are things thay come after fear and that is what I did. Let me tell you when I was on that plane about to fall I was terrified. But once those 5 seconds of fear was over It was a blissful experience. I loved doing it and I will 100 percent do it again.< /Text>

Wanted to take a moment to write a positive review for lake Elsinore skydiving. My instructor Andy was absolutely wonderful and clearly knew his stuff. Although I was extremely scared to make the jump out of the plane, Andy and the other staff created a very safe and fun environment. I couldn’t have asked for more from my first skydiving experience. An absolutely wonderful experience. Thank you Andy! :)< /text>

<text>Skydiving was probably one of the BEST things i've ever done in my entire life! I came here to celebrate my friends 21st birthday and after two weeks of contemplating this once in a lifetime opportunity to skydive I probably would have never thought of actually going haha!!. It was a group of us and our appointment was set at 11 A.M. however, the sky was very cloudy that day so therefore we had to wait a couple of hours to see if the clouds would clear up. I was very optimistic that we were gonna skydive that day ! Shout out to the guy we met there named Stake! He gave us a tour around the grounds (only because it was very cloudy and it was a high chance that we weren't going to be able to skydive due to weather). He showed us the airplanes and just told us what to expect when we were going to jump hahaha! After a couple hours of waiting the sun began to come out and the clouds started to clear up and it was showtime !! Justin (super funny dude) was my skydive instructor and I cannot thank him enough for making my first skydive experience so much fun! He kept ensuring me that everything was gonna go smooth and he was very knowledgeable about skydiving and he told me everything I have to do to make this go well. Honestly I wasn't as nervous as I was days before but I was just so ready to experience this thrill! Justin made sure that I was secure and as soon as we were getting ready to get on the plane, he told me that we were going first haha. Skydiving is not as scary as people might think it is, however the experience is probably different for every person but thanks to all the friendly and professional staff for making this experience memorable I will definitely come back with my family !!  Thank you so much Beth (I think that is her name), Justin, the camera guy (I forgot his name lol)  and Stake for making this experience so AMAZING!!<//text>< pictures>

Great experience! I went with a friend for our first tandem skydive experience. I was surprised by how easy the whole process was. The reception staff are indeed (as other reviewers posted) very friendly and welcoming while also being very professional in making sure you understand everything. Then it was all easy. We got to meet our skydiving pros. They didn't do much explaining, I guess because there wasn't much needed. Both very friendly and talkative. The place has an interesting hippie vibe.< /Review>

<review>So last time we were out there was back in October durning the Hall of fame event going on at another drop zone amd we came over here to jump with some friends in from Switzerland.  This place was so great.  The staff was friendly and very helpful. The ladies in manifest were some of the best. If you are looking for a dropzone to have a good time at and has a family like vibe this is the place for you< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1583789164710, 'text': 'We appreciate your feedback.

In full disclosure, I have posted reviews of Skydive Elsinore before. It's been awhile and I am happy to say that nothing has changed. They are still a great, professional, and safe dropzone</Text>

I was jumping at Skydive Elsinore in November/December..
It's an increíble cozy DZ with a huge landing area and a fantastic view. The bunk beds are comfy and the staff is just fantastic..

I ended up forgetting my altimeter, went back home (Germany) thinking I will never see it ever again.. I got in touch with the DZ and Daniella (manifest) was going so much out of her way to get that alti back to me.. Shes arranged the drop of at the manifest, the packaging, went to the post office and constantly informed me about her next steps.. This is literally pure selflessness. We don't even know each other in person and I am more than grateful to have had her taken all my fear and can now say l that I've finally got it back..! She has even put some goodies into the package. Skydive Elsinore has in general very special vibes around and these amazing staffs are just the cherry on top. Please hold onto these kind people working at your manifest. They really make the differences to other DZs around. I will for sure recommend this DZ to anybody and we will see each other in one year again!! Thank you with all my heart!!!!! ❤️</text>

It's quite a popular place for jumpers, alot of solo jumpers. If your trying to do a tandem jump, go early morning the wait time is close to 2hrs, towards the end of the day the wait time exceeds 4 hrs. Overall you will have a wonderful experience.< /Text>

<text>My friend Annie gave me this tandem jump experience with Skydive Elsinore as a birthday gift. My jump was on Saturday, July 7,2018. It was my first time. I had a blast!!! One of the best experiences. My instructor, Matt (AKA Fred) was excellent. He made this first jump both instructional and relaxing. The whole crew at Skydive Elsinore was very friendly and encouraging to newbies to the experience. I would recommend this outfit to anyone and everyone that is planning their first skydive adventure. Thanks again Skydive Elsinore. Jackie W.< /text>< Pics>

Skydive Elsinore is a ton of fun and a great deal for the money. They currently have a $149 special. The staff is well trained and courteous, especially the woman, Sin, at the registration counter. I highly recommend Skydive Elsinore!!! *****</text>

<Review>I used to skydive in the 80s & 90s, we took my son for a tandem jump for his 18th birthday and we had a blast.  The instructors are awesome, all top notch professionals with many years of experience.

I think everyone should jump once, maybe 2 times because you only get 50-60 seconds of free fall time.  Skydiving is one of the safest sports out there with 1 death per 1,000,000 jumps.  There aren't many sports with that safety record except maybe checkers.

Do it once, you'll never regret it.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1544890713922, 'text': 'Ray,\nThank you for this awesome feedback!

It has the friendly, home-style feel of a small drop zone, but with the experience and equipment of a larger drop zone.  I've been to a number of drop zones in the Southern California area and I recommend Skydive Elsinore hands down. Highly recommend for tandem jumps.  Part of the experience is the friendly atmosphere, so its a great place to bring a first time tandem jumper.  Got my A license at this drop zone. Best experience ever!</text>< Pictures>

This is a great fun jumper DZ. There is a welcoming, helpful atmosphere and the DZ turns plenty of loads. My only complaint is the desert landing area for those with less than 200 jumps. It's full of gravel and other small plants, and is on very uneven ground. It would be awesome if there was more grass for those with less than 200 jumps, or if that landing area was opened up to those with 100+ jumps like Eloy, Perris, etc.< /Text>

My good friend ( melissa ) and I went sky diving yesterday (07/20/19) for the first time ever! The experience  was amaze the staff was so personable and full of personality which made for an even better experience.  My instructor  Fred Macarter rocked! I was so anxious , nervous and excited at the same time he helped ease that anxiety.  My friend and I both purchased the upgraded package for pictures and video  ( which I highly recommend)to capture the moment  up high. Christopher Arnold was my friend photographer  and he did great he captured great photos and every angle that you would want as diver. Lots of photos and group photos of us on the plane and pictures and video of her landing and short recap of how she felt once landing. Unfortunately my didnt capture as many photos  nor did he capture my landing  with picture or video. bummer.  But fortunately. I could see a little glimpse of my landing from my friends video since I landed right after her.

Skydive Elsinore is the place to do it. If you're going to do it ... do it! It's well worth it</Review>

<Text>Great first time everyone was friendly yet professional. I really appreciated tandem jumper Joe, made the experience comfortable and fun. I wasn't scared or second guessing at all but i got the feeling if i was joe woulda been the dude to get me to go through with it. 2 things they dont tell you worth noting, first a minor pounding pain in your head till your ears are able to pop and even then it takes about 15 mins to hear normally. Second the immense pressure on the upper thigh area once the shoot deploys, homie his best to help adjust but it would have needed to be done differently from the get go. Overall those little things are minor inconveniences when you realize you just jumped out of a plane. I would absolutely go again with the main goal of being able to jump without being attached to someone.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Really nice DZ. Very nice facilities and the LO staff is great. Really fast manifest and organization. The big guy at the grill is awesome and will provide you with awesome tacos. Great view over the lake and one of the best places to book a ticket, because of the view.<//review>

< review>
This was my first time skydiving. I'd heard before that skydiving is a "hurry up and wait" kind of experience, so I was prepared for it. I made my appointment for 11/2 at 9 am, but I showed up at 8:30. (It's just always better to have the extra cushion of time.) What you need to understand first off is that your safety is in their hands, and they have a lot of factors to contend with - wind/weather conditions, properly securing the equipment, seeing to every jumper, and yes, the paperwork, because if you haven't heard, Americans are kind of litigious, and they have to cover their bases. So you likely won't be going up right on time. I, myself didn't get geared up until closer to 10, but hey, if that's the cost of me safely landing from a 12,500 foot drop, then that's fine by me!
I was lucky to get Marcelo as my instructor - he immediately made me feel right at ease with everything. He was very friendly, personable, and positive. Even with the plane at the full altitude, I wasn't anxious like I thought I would be. And the jump? Well, you'd just have to try it for yourself to know what it's really like! In Elsinore, you see it all - the desert, the mountains, and the sea. It was an incredible experience, and I will definitely be doing it again. I am so glad I came here for my first jump!</review>

<review>The first time I went I had a wonderful time but my DVD that I purchased was scratched. Fast forward 7 years and I go to skydive again. The experience is 5 stars, but the quality of the video I got was so incredibly poor. I was incredibly disappointed because there is no way they can redo it unless I jump again, which, physically, I can't. The guy doing the photography and videotaping had the sun in the background the duration of my jump so you can't even see anything except a speck against the sun. He never got close enough so one would never know who or what even jumped out of the plane, let alone knowing that it's me. I paid extra for the DVD and photos and regardless that the cameraman isn't a professional, he could at least have the knowledge to know that you should be able to SEE the person you are filming. My friend who jumped with me also paid extra and while their video game it great, it took Skydive Elsinore over a week to send it. Claiming that they had sent it when in reality they never did. It's supposed to be received within 48 hours. All in all, at least the most important part, the jump, was perfect.<//review>< pictures>

It was my Dads 60th so we got him a skydiving trip, my wife and a close family friend all went with him.  The original day we went was too cloudy we had to reschedule , which was a breeze to do with the very friendly and helpful staff. Today we went and the staff was great very social and really pumped it up to make it fun, I have to say that Jared was a shining star and just his energy made me want to sign up, but then I realized I was a chicken. we did the video package everything was great, our good friend had a rough landing where she didn't get her feet up and it looks like she broke her ankle. Again the staff were very good professional and caring but I think they need to improve the communication with the family on when an incident happens, however seldom it may be. The instructors did a great job getting her the care she needed , I hope that the instructor H. doesn't blame himself. the video and pictures are well worth the money because it is such a whirlwind of a trip, its good to look back on.  all in all I would recommend going skydiving her and strongly recommend you practice lifting your legs up before you go!</Review>

<review>When I lived in Southern Cal, my primary DZ was Elsinore.I was forced to give up jumping in 1969.
In the near future,it is a good possibility that I will be in your area.It is my number one priority to visit your facility and get back in the swing of things.
Question does my previous experience have any influence or is it a ground zero situation?

My home Dropzone. Love jumping with my friends here. Big packing mat with packers available. It's Southern California, so weather is good all year. Huge landing area on both sides of the runway.</Review>

<text>Staff is friendly and planes were fast. Lots of fun jumpers (mostly freefly), so finding someone to jump with if you're visiting is pretty easy. Large packing area. Only drawback is the area isn't very scenic, it can be super hot in the summer and the dust devils that spring up in the afternoons whenever it's warm.</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dc9b0de03f4dc3:0x5ffe018cfc0e8559< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Skydive Elsinore provides a very unique experience for those willing to be hurled out of an aircraft and into a freefall. Their staff are well qualified, and know what they are doing.

From a critical perspective, it appears that scheduling could be managed a little better. Our early morning schedule which was purchased in advance was delayed and we, along with other tandem jumpers waited approximately 5 hours before the jump. The wait was not due to weather, or mechanical delays, as group after group went ahead. When inquiring about the status of the assigned jump the typical answer given was "about thirty more minutes" which degraded into uncertainty.

It could be that this situation was rare.

Overall, you'll enjoy the experience, but be prepared to wait just in case it turns into an unexpectedly long day.</text>

Skydive Elsinore is always full of fun and awesome people! Everyone is so inviting and genuinely excited to be there. The drive from to Elsinore is the shortest way to get from DTLA to airplane, and the view from the top has both mountains and ocean, with Catalina in sight on a clear day. Don't miss this 5 star dropzone!<//text>

<review>I completed my very first tandem jump today and it was a great experience! It’s been on my bucket list for quite some time, so I decided to take the plunge on my 57th birthday. As a private pilot, I’ve been in and around planes for years, but have never jumped out of one. The staff was a pleasure to work with during the entire process. The atmosphere around the DZ was awesome! My instructor; Rob, was fantastic! He was very thorough and professional. His canopy handling skills were impressive. My videographer and jump camera man; Matt, was also fun, professional, and skillful. I’m hooked! I will definitely return to Skydive Elsinore for another jump in the future. I might even sign up for my AFF course!
Kudos to the Skydive Elsinore team! 😎</review>< Resp>

<Review>My experience was amazing and beautiful. I jumped tandem with Ken (my instructor) who was awesome y habla español. :) He made sure I was properly secured, pointed out views along the way, let me take the reigns as he taught me a little about how to steer the chute. It was so much fun! Incredibly beautiful to be flying so high. My camera-girl did a great job also. All the staff was very friendly. I will be going back!

<text>I love Skydive Elsinore! It's such a friendly dz, helpful staff, good amenities, and great jumping for both experienced and new jumpers.  The views while skydiving are brilliant and good to capture on video.  Lots of coaching available for all levels to build or refine their skills. Kit store, bar, snack bar, bunks and showers on site, think there's rv hook-up available too. We've been coming here since 2001 and this place never disappoints. The staff can cater for solo jumpers or teams and various British teams regularly hold expeds here.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Easy process. Nice people. Lots of fun. I took my son for his 18th birthday. He was not feeling well and we got through the whole process waiting to get on the plane. He wanted to jump do badly I could not convince him to come back another day until his headache was so bad he decided to reschedule. Lake Elsinore Skydiving made it super easy to reschedule.  I just called them up when we were ready a few weeks later and we showed up. The instructors were nice. Only issue is waiting around not knowing how long is going to take to get to from start to finish. They tell you it would be a two to four hour process. That kind of kills your day and any plans. Lots of fun nonetheless. My son had an awesome time. My ears started hurting super bad with the altitude change on the freefall. They're still plugged up. Another young man in the plane said the same thing when we were finishing up. Not sure how to change that or what to recommend for someone else, just know there's a possibility this may occur.</review>

I made a reservation for 11:00 AM and was told, upon arriving, that this was just an estimate. The paperwork and safety video takes about 20 minutes maybe. I'm okay with all of this, but then we were told to sign in at another desk where we were told we would have to wait about two hours. So, we went for lunch and came back only to learn that our wait had been extended by another hour and a half. I've been skydiving before and never had to wait this long.< /text>

<Text>I took my daughter here for her 19th Birthday. Best decision ever. I want to thank the entire office staff, especially "Ashley" for being so welcoming, informative, patient and helpful. My instructor "Itai" was extremely competent, professional, knowledgable and cared about making my experience the BEST! The entire staff, instructors and pilot were of the highest quality. They make the atmosphere so uplifting, positive, and fun. Their amazing playlist of songs was relevant to the whole experience. This experience is priceless. I left there with a profound memory to share with my daughter for the rest of our life. We are definitely going back and I definetely recommend this place to family and friends.

I'm an AFF student and had my first jumps yesterday.

Ground coach: Lindsay
AFF Level 1: Luca & Brodie
AFF Level 2: Luca & Cory

First off the staff are all AMAZING people. Fun, enjoyable, and super professional when it comes to "safety" and training.

I trust my life with these individuals and have complete confidence in their skills and abilities simply because of the fact that they know what the hell they are doing and have the jumps to prove it.

The facility is pretty nice and I really liked the metal work throughout the entire place. There's a stainless steel logo in the office and the welds blew my mind. Clean bathrooms and showers. Nice shaded area to chill.

***ADVICE FOR AFF LEVEL 1 STUDENTS***
PLAN AHEAD ON STAYING 2 DAYS just in case.

Personally, as a student, I think it's better to make a weekend out of it whenever you visit Skydive Elsinore. There's a lot to learn and trying learn anything after a 2 hour commute is daunting.

This isn't like getting a Bachelor's Degree. There's no "pass and forget" so make sure you are fresh and ready soak in the important info and be ready to drill it in! 100% commitment.

In retrospect, I thought it was a more beneficial to the learning process to have the ground class, sleep on it, study, and be rested and alert for the next day.

Lastly, after everything is checked and rechecked, the wind still determines who jumps. The entire facility can be grounded if the weather is bad.

Levels 2-8 do not take that long and neither do the solos. You can easily get multiple jumps completed in 1 day; however, staying that extra day and keeping a track of the weather before you go will maximize your chances of getting your jumps in.

Do not schedule things too far in advance because the weather can change. You have to be flexible.

One thing not listed on their website is that they offer wind tunnel training with a coach. If you are between Levels 3 and 4 it is a great option to explore< /Text>

<user_name>Bryan Zuniga</user_name><time>1443337794240<//time><rate>1<//rate><Review>The WHOLE staff excluding my instructor was HORRIBLE! Horrendous customer service, very unwelcoming people, extremely unorganized, and very unhelpful in every way.  For one we had an appointment at 1 o clock and I was thinking okay we have an appointment we should be in and out in about 2 hours. Wrong! Appointments literally mean nothing here! It all depends what time you show up and sign in. We as in my sister and I got there before two girls  that were also tandem skydiving for the first time. We had met them in the video room and we checked in BEFORE THEM we were already sitting on the picnic benches as we watched them check in. We talked to them for the entire wait which was 4 and a half hours just to get called up! And they along with a few others who also got there after us took off BEFORE us after bringing this up to the staff multiple times they said there is no way that can possibly happene. They kept repeating that same information. Well guess what man? It happened and we are not happy. We had plans for later in the day. The wait time would have been no big deal if they would have been straight up and said oh it's gonna be 4 hours we have a lot of challenges today. Instead they told us it would be an hour and a half. As we sat there for over four hours there was NO COMMUNICATION about why it was taking so long. It's understandable that skydiving is complicated and a lot can go wrong causing major delays but at least communicate that to us so we can plan accordingly instead of wiltering in 95 degree weather.  So we FINALLY get to skydive which I can say was definitely a huge thrill. I paid the whole 90$ for the video and I'm super excited to watch it and share it with all my friends who are waiting to see it as soon as I get home. Only to find out that it is not on the USB drive  they gave me! Just the pictures and a short 28 second long interview but no video of my actual jump. It was all because my video person decided to go back up for another jump without turning my video in and now I think my video is gone forever. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Ruined my first ever skydive. I just want to give a special shoutout to my instructor Mike who made me feel better about the whole thing and made my actual jump something I won't forget despite all the misfortunes that took place.< /Review>< pics>

I heard some foreigners injured in this place and ironically their accidents stories  were same .
The manager said my nephew injured just because of the wind issue even if there was a suspicious of the instructior’s tiresome , no motivations , nervousness as I watched the video .
He signed up on the waiver
Which meant he could not claim about it
Other foreigner injured at this place a year ago
The reason was the wind .
My assumption is whoever gets injured there while they are landing
Others will get injured in the future
The reason will be the wind
Specially for the foreigners</Review>

Wow should not be the word at all. the service sucks, the staff so so, the manager don't know what the hell he is doing, runing back and and forth, the important thing to him is how to make an extra buck. Instructors very stuck up, I paid for the AFF which is more expensive than the tandem. I was charged for two camera men, each at $90. they pretended it was an honest mistake. (fine)
It was my 50th birthday, and wanted to celebrated with a big event. went to lake Elsinore sky diving school, I wanted to jump AFF not tandem, spent 6 hours that day on the ground training, untill the instructor said I am ready, and he went to check on the flight, he came back telling me that the they do not send a plane up with just one person. it is not cost effective.
I had to contact over thirty people who wanted to come and see my first jump on my B.day to cancel and ask them if they could come the next morning. Anyway, the next morning we caravaned four cars with about 20 people to lake Elsinore.
I met with a different instructor his name was nick who wanted to give a refresher before my jump, he said thet he is not impressed and he need to talk to the manager about the jump, and they offered me a tandum jump, I refused and asked them to refund me my money. still insisting on doing the tandem jump they sent this instructor nick to ask me as to why I don't want to be jump Tandem, and if being strapped to another person would me feel comfortable then this is not a good frame of mind or reason. Imagine this is coming from a guy who is as old as my son giving me an advice a 50 year old man.
I got my refund without looking at the reciept, later on I found that they took $25.00 deposit out. will see about that!!!! I did not break the contract they did, and they will pay the deposit back anyway. As I was leaving the manager his name I believe is libo I guess, said something stupid " at the end of the day we make the call" hmmmm.<//review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Very, very good dz. The prices are reasonable, friendly staff, incredibly beautiful, everything you need is in place)
There is only no arrow for the preselection, which is not usual, since the wind changes me regularly.

Very, very nice drop zone) really nice personal, not so expensive. Very beautiful, especially on a sun set. Very comfortable to skydive)

(Original)
Очень, очень хорошая дз. Цены вменяемые, приветливый персонал, безумно красиво, есть все необходимое на месте)
Нету только стрелки для преземлегия, что не привычно, так как ветер меняет я регулярно.

(Translated by Google) Very fine place. Really fine staff. After a short-term cancellation of a neighboring place, it would help very well. We were able to complete our training.

Thanks to the chief instructor for your kindness.

Mega brilliant dropzone. 😂😂🥰

Sehr feiner Platz. Mal richtig feiner Staff. Nach  einer kurzfristigen Absage eines Nachbarplatzes, würde sehr gut geholfen. Wir konnten unsere Ausbildung doch durchführen.

(Translated by Google) You can enjoy the beautiful scenery. The pack area is outdoors, so it is sunny. The landing area is divided by license. The adjacent inn is beautiful for the low price. The fan jump is $ 35.
